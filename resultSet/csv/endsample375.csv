Until that moment the song has a mischievous air: Viv Albertine palm-mutes an off-kilter chord progression, Palmolive's beat lurches in fits and starts, and Up muffles a shit-eating grin as she whispers to her co-conspirators, ""Put the cheddar in the pocket, put the rest under the jacket. Talk to the cashier, he won't suspect."" It's a song about punking the system in order to eat (""Babylonian won't lose much/And we'll have dinner tonight""), but it's also a revolt against villains more pervasive than the corner store cashier: the false promises of dole-dependent England, the stereotypical norms of femininity, and the stifling conventions of the late-1970s musical establishment. Up, with her defiant scream, leads a gleefully liberating getaway. </p>
<p>Though Up was arguably the most outspoken Slit, guitarist Viv Albertine was responsible for the jouncing upstrokes that characterized the group's sound. Albertine's anarchic collision of reggae rhythms and abrasive noise made her one of the more innovative guitarists of punk's first wave. Still, while their friends in the Clash and the Sex Pistols were embracing the idea of beaming their subversive messages to the masses, the Slits kept it resolutely uncommercial. (Though it almost surely would have been a hit, they refused to release their terrific cover of ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" as their debut single.) Admirable as these DIY instincts are, it's a tiny tragedy of rock history that a song <i>about</i> Viv Albertine (her remote, railway-accessible home + a jilted ex named Mick Jones = ""Train in Vain"") is much more widely known than any song she ever wrote (she composed, among others, the Slits' sardonic anthem ""Typical Girls""). It's a much bigger tragedy, though, that after the Slits disbanded, Albertine claims she didn't touch her Telecaster for 25 years.</p>
<p>But after the Slits' mid-aughts reunion (which was cut short by Up's untimely death a few years later) Albertine started writing again. ""It was like an avalanche,"" she recalled in a 2010 <a href=""http://www.vivalbertine.com/interview_the_quietus.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, ""I became like a teenage boy, who had to be in his room playing every day... It was quite strange for a woman of a certain age to feel like this [but] I realized I hadn't known what was going on in myself until it all came flying out from the guitar."" The result of this outpouring of creativity was Albertine's highly personal <i>Flesh</i> EP, released in 2010 on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace! label. Softer and more vulnerable than her work in the Slits, Albertine's solo work tackles themes of love, marriage, and disillusionment with equal parts humor and pathos. And though her solo debut (coming 33 years after <i>Cut</i>), <i>The Vermillion Border </i>improves upon the EP in almost every way, it's still shot through with the same sense of urgency. True to her first band's uncommercial instincts, it sounds like the work of somebody who picked her guitar back up simply because she had something she needed to say.</p>
<p>Like ""Shoplifting"", ""Confessions of a MILF"", the best song on the album, ping-pongs between repression and release. Documenting an unhappy housewife's inner voice, Albertine whispers the verses' exaggeratedly saccharine melody (""I've peeled the potatoes, there's not much left to do/ Lovely lemon drizzle cake, heat up the fondue"") like a Stepford Wife singing an Oompah Loompah parable. But the longer the song goes on, the more its undercurrent of darkness bubbles to the surface. By its finale, a warping, manically chanted refrain of ""There's no place like home,"" the song becomes reminiscent of Sleater-Kinney's ""Modern Girl"", a quietly dystopian dream to choked to death on its own fairy dust. Unlike ""Shoplifting"", though, it never provides that moment of catharsis. But its hush only adds to the song's unsettling power. ""MILF"" is an updated take on an idea the Slits always embodied: Punk isn't necessarily about making the loudest noise, but giving breath to the most radical, surprising, and unspoken truths.</p>
<p>Though it doesn't reach the same heights, <i>Vermillion Border</i> at times recalls Marianne Faithfull's mid-career, middle-age masterpiece <i>Broken English.</i> Not every critique is as much of a direct hit as ""MILF""; songs like ""The False Heart"" and ""The Madness of Clouds"" ramble on with variations of themes explored more compellingly elsewhere. But thankfully her wit returns on the hilariously biting ""Hookup Girl"". A fairytale of modern courtship (""I was his forever girl/ Now he's asking me to be his hookup girl""), it first seems like the song's narrator has it better than the miserably repressed self-proclaimed MILF. But instead, the song unfurls a provocative question: Is hookup culture liberating, or just another gilded cage? Albertine's narrator would probably say the latter: As the affair corrodes into boring sex, she finds herself sighing a lyric that could have been lifted from ""MILF"": ""We don't talk, he doesn't want to know my thoughts.""</p>
<p>A fiery, irreverent teenager herself when she arrived on the London scene, Albertine knows better than anybody that punk has always been the province of the young (and young men in particular). So even when <i>The Vermillion Border</i> occasionally ambles and falls short, there's still something kinetic and refreshingly subversive about its biting, wizened, and uncompromisingly feminist voice. Nowhere is this felt more viscerally than on the opening track, where over a seething swirl of guitars, Albertine shouts a simple rallying cry, ""I want more!"" It's an affirmation from, in Albertine's words, a woman of a certain age who sometimes still feels (and shreds) like a teenage boy. </p></div>"|17354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17354-the-vermilion-border/|7.2|Lindsay Zoladz

On the 2011 EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16021-genre-specific-xperience/"" target=""_blank""><i>Genre-Specific Xperience</i></a>, she envisioned an atmosphere of dark luxury and conjured a kind of underground new age embodied by the gothic Tropicália of songs like ""Hip Hop Spa"". This follow-up EP, befitting its title, moves into exquisitely violent terrain. ""It's named after a Sega Megadrive game from 1992, based on Operation Desert Storm from the first Gulf War in 1991,"" Al Qadiri <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14430-ghost-raid/"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Ruth Saxelby. ""The record is dedicated to this sci-fi period of my childhood-- surviving the invasion of Kuwait, the war, and then playing a video game based on those events a year later."" It's her best and most affecting work yet.</p>
<p>With <i>Desert Strike</i>, Al Qadiri creates a new mood and aesthetic while maintaing the essential character of her music. The basic construction is similar to that found on <i>Genre-Specific Xperience </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15902-warn-u-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>WARN-U</i></a>, the EP she released under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29983-ayshay/"" target=""_blank"">Ayshay</a>: Tracks are built using pointedly synthetic versions of steel drums, spectral chanting, organs, and horns, but despite the almost cartoonish texture, the result feels more like sacred music. Topical elements reinforce the militaristic cast-- song titles like ""War Games"" or ""Oil Well"" and sounds of weapons cocked or shells clinking on the floor are not exactly subtle-- but they shade the tone of the project instead of defining it. Each arrangement is a carefully constructed exercise in urgency and tension, from a bloodthirsty kickdrum right out of the gates on the title track to the faux horns on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14430-ghost-raid/"" target=""_blank"">""Ghost Raid""</a> ballooning in and out in a way that could menace a band of spirit-possessed army tanks. But in spite of the music's inherent ties to aggressive themes-- war, violence, international strife-- it is not abrasive. Al Qadiri can make this stuff sound uncannily feminine and soothing.</p>
<p>Highly conceptual music always comes with limitations, and it's is difficult to imagine hearing <i>Desert Strike</i> EP outside of a private listening setting. But Al Qadiri makes the specificity work. It's one thing to mine the internet for scattershot cool sounds and throw them all at a wall in the hopes that some will stick; it's another thing to imagine an insular parallel universe and build it from scratch. On the evidence of <i>Desert Strike</i>, Al Qadiri has got a few more worlds in mind, just waiting to come to life. </p></div>"|17312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17312-desert-strike-ep/|7.9|Carrie Battan

The hourlong work was the soundtrack to a video piece, a project notable for two uses of technology. One, the video was meant to be viewed on a television placed on its side (there's a YouTube rip out there that requires you to rotate your laptop). And with its 61-minute runtime, <i>Thursday Afternoon</i> was promoted as the first piece to be created specifically for compact disc. Before the arrival of the CD a couple of years before, works of such duration had to be spread across sides. And since <i>Thursday Afternoon</i> was an immersive ambient piece in the classic Eno mold, the idea that you could absorb it uninterrupted in one hour-long session was important.</p>
<p><i>Thursday Afternoon</i> seemed to drift in place; it was music that seemed not so much ""played"" as ""allowed to exist."" Its structure brought to mind wind chimes, as a handful of individually pleasing elements-- a few notes of piano, some light synth treatments-- knocked around the space arbitrarily but seemed to benefit from the lack of order. Eno's first true ambient work, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""><i>Discreet Music</i></a>, from 1975, was his first example of the form; there, he generated a handful of electronic synth tones and allowed them to cycle through chance patterns (the title track from that album also pushed the limits of technology, with over 30 minutes of audio on a single LP side). And now, Eno's new solo album, first created for an art installation, is another. <i>Lux</i> consists of four tracks spread across 75 minutes, but you don't really know where one ends and another begins and it doesn't matter. Like those earlier works, a small number of sounds that complement each other are set loose in a space and allowed to move around in different configurations, with subtle patterns sometimes emerging from the randomness. The most prominent of these sounds is single piano notes played quietly, which further connects the work to <i>Thursday Afternoon</i> in the Eno lineage. But where the 1985 album felt submerged and ghostly, <i>Lux</i> is clear and bright, with the crisp higher harmonics allowed to come through.</p>
<p>The other Eno work that comes to mind with <i>Lux</i> isn't a CD, but yet another boundary-pushing use of technology, and that's his iPhone app <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bloom/id292792586?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bloom</a>. The basic elements of light, thin drone mixed with piano notes that strike, decay, and play against other notes is also the central idea of Bloom. The danger with a program like Bloom, where Eno creates a generative system that allows the listener to make his or her own ambient pieces, is that it raises the question: What purpose does the artist himself serve at that point? He's possibly invented himself out of existence. But if <i>Lux</i> does nothing else, it suggests that there's a reason Eno's name has become synonymous with ""ambient"" and why his thoughts on the music remain the gold standard.</p>
<p><i>Thursday Afternoon</i> was assembled to accompany a ""visual painting"" and Eno studied art, and it's best to think of his music using the language of design-- the colors used, their proportions, how they are laid out and balanced in the space. Eno is brilliant at getting things just so. So <i>Lux</i> has a mix of space and sound that feels right; no one element dominates or becomes grating over the course of 75 minutes, even though all repeat over and over. Piano notes linger, there are light plucks on what could be a harp, and everything is bathed in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/7942-the-out-door-11/2/"" target=""_blank"">Deep Listening</a>-levels of reverb. While it accomplishes Eno's long-stated goal of changing the mood and feel of a room, ""tinting"" the atmosphere, it refuses to enforce any feeling in particular. </p>
<p>It's easy to forget that Eno's ambient work doesn't always fit his strict definition. <i>Music for Films</i> sounds like it-- it's very suggestive of particular feeling-- and the brilliant <i>Ambient 4: On Land</i> conjures an entire landscape, one filled with swamps and strange creatures. But <i>Lux</i> is squarely in the tradition of music that can be ignored but holds up (sometimes just barely) to closer scrutiny. It turns any living room into an art installation where interesting things may or may not happen, and its lack of direction and specificity is in its own way brave. Sometimes it's hard to not say anything; Brian Eno is doing just that, once again, and beautifully. </p></div>"|17303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17303-lux/|8.0|Mark Richardson

<p>Their refusal to stay in one place could also make them seem out-of-step in a charming way. But if you zoom out a little, you can see a gradual and defined path Mouse on Mars have taken over the past 15 years. The pair's forward chug came to a head on this year's excellent <i>Parastrophics</i>, which was made to sound, in St. Werner's words, ""as digital as possible."" It was a dense, colorfully overstuffed album that found St. Werner and Toma aligned with electronic music's current maximalist sound while still retaining their sense of themselves. </p>
<p><i>WOW</i>, Mouse on Mars' second release this year, is a companion piece to <i>Parastrophics </i>and has a similar approach. But where <i>Parastrophics</i>' gestation was long and involved, <i>WOW</i> was conceived and recorded in a matter of weeks. The relative ease is apparent in the music. There's still a lot going on here-- at 33 minutes, even a deep listen feels like being smacked with a whirlwind of ideas-- but the longer compositions' raw elements are allowed more space to linger and develop. Here, Mouse on Mars focus on a deconstruction of the wonky, oddball bass music common to Modeselektor's Monkeytown imprint. ""We are still essentially the free jazz part of Monkeytown,"" St. Werner told <i>The Stool Pigeon</i> in February of this year. ""We never really liked electronic dance music before, but now we like some.""</p>
<p>The album's first extended cut, ""DOG"", is a fine example of how Mouse on Mars riff on an established idea. The track starts with a few simple, eerie tones before settling into a ruddy bassline that practically squeaks against the speakers. With every repetition of that figure, something new happens-- a cluster of high-pitched video game sounds, a sly change in rhythm, what sounds like a jet engine being sucked into another jet engine. Finally, only the track's original skeleton is recognizable, and you get a sense of just how much it has morphed. </p>
<p><i>WOW</i> lacks the gut-punch energy of <i>Parastrophics, </i>but it's still an enjoyable twist on what<i> else</i> can be done with the already malleable world of bass music; once again Mouse on Mars refuse to stay in one place, but they almost always head somewhere interesting. </p></div>"|17274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17274-wow/|7.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

It's possibly the least appropriate image they could have chosen to help illustrate how the music inside sounded. That album, titled <i>Photodrame</i>, is so claustrophobically downbeat that it makes the band's most obvious inspirations (early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a>) seem positively sprightly in comparison. <i>Photodrame</i> is included in full on this box set from <a href=""http://sacredbonesrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sacred Bones</a>, which includes the band's second record, <i>Ils Étaient 9 Dans L'Obscurité</i>, plus a compilation album of rarities.

Truly they are a band out of time.</p>
<p><i>Photodrame </i>was originally released in 1987, but it bears hallmarks that stretch back to the previous decade. The squalling ball of compact energy at the heart of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/640-cabaret-voltaire/"">Cabaret Voltaire</a>'s classic synth-abuse track <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-IixtxKETU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nag Nag Nag""</a> is occasionally mirrored, although Trop Tard were operating on a strict guitar/bass/drum machine set-up at the time. The overall sound appears to be a consequence of two forces colliding. For one, there's a punk-like amateurishness to the playing. <span>Philippe Lixtre's</span> bassline on ""La Mort Est Humaine"" is so loose and unrefined it feels like you're witnessing a musician learning to play in real time. Secondly, this was a home recording, with the tape hiss lending an appropriately decaying atmosphere to songs like the rare English language venture ""Johnny Is a Loser"". Sadly, it's unlikely we'll ever find out Trop Tard's true motivations. The people behind this music remain cloaked in mystery, with Sacred Bones only releasing this set by negotiating with the remaining living member through a third party. </p>
<p>One thing abundantly clear from <i>Photodrame </i>is that a large stack of pent-up anguish was offloaded into this music. The vocals from <span>Fabien Doe</span> are uncomfortably raw, from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22521-the-birthday-party/"">Birthday Party</a> howl drilled into the center of ""Le Chant Des Martyrs"" to the sheer surliness of ""Ma Folie Se Dessiner"". That sense of collapse, of witnessing someone pushed to the brink for their art, is something the band polished up when they got a chance to move beyond their debut. <i>Ils Etaient 9 Dans L'Obscurité</i>, released just a year later, is a pro effort in comparison. The playing and singing are both vastly improved, in the process removing some of the unease from their work. But the payoff is more satisfying here. ""Les Anges D'Aujourd'hui"" is artfully threaded between the bedsit pining of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3859-soft-cell/"">Soft Cell</a> and the screaming guitar sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7616-magazine/"">Magazine</a>, while ""Maman"" is masterfully drunken, hinting at frictional territory Trop Tard could have explored had the band enjoyed a greater shelf life.</p>
<p>The fact that <i>Ils Etaient 9 Dans L'Obscurité</i> was an end that should have been a beginning is, of course, a big part of the appeal. Short-lived bands that leave a giant question mark behind allow us to create imaginary future narratives in out heads, places where acts like Trop Tard further honed their potential and reached out to a wider audience. But the underlying picture that emerges with repeat plays of <i>Too Late</i> is one of a band that was a little too damaged to function beyond the tiny coterie they attracted. It's not hard to figure out that the mind behind the bleak ""Les Rêves De Peur"" from <i>Ils Etaient 9 Dans L'Obscurité</i> was ill-equipped for success of any kind. Even upbeat tracks like ""L'Analyse"" and the positively violent ""Mort D'Une Ame"" are plunged into the black by<span> Doe's</span> tormented vocal passages, where he slurs and sobs and whines around the edges of every word. Many of the lyrics are sung in French, but someone without knowledge of the language can easily grasp the intent, so great is the emotion that bleeds from every syllable.</p>
<p>Trop Tard's failings emerge through the lack of variation in their work, through a bloody-minded determination to remain mired in a place of discomfort. When the songs don't quite work, such as on the additional disc of rare and unheard material belonging to this collection, there's something defiantly teenage about it, like you've just walked in on a sulking adolescent picking holes in his sweater. That's a danger any band operating at this level of despondency potentially faces, but Trop Tard mostly get the balance right over the course of <i>Too Late</i>. The fact that they dropped into a hole and disappeared suggests they may have had a lack of confidence in their art, but there's also a nagging feeling that this wasn't a band built to survive the business end of the industry. It's difficult to picture a group with such a world-weary weight on its shoulders doing promo, making videos, signing contracts. <i>Too Late</i> finally provides some space to get that immovable ache out into the world.</p></div>"|17265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17265-too-late-box-set/|6.1|Nick Neyland

It's possibly the least appropriate image they could have chosen to help illustrate how the music inside sounded. That album, titled <i>Photodrame</i>, is so claustrophobically downbeat that it makes the band's most obvious inspirations (early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a>) seem positively sprightly in comparison. <i>Photodrame</i> is included in full on this box set from <a href=""http://sacredbonesrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sacred Bones</a>, which includes the band's second record, <i>Ils Étaient 9 Dans L'Obscurité</i>, plus a compilation album of rarities. Trop Tard's name translates as ""Too Late,"" providing a near-perfect title for this collection, mainly because it's taken around 25 years for this material to get a proper reissue, but also because it missed the 21st-century cold wave resurgence by at least a couple of years. Truly they are a band out of time.</p>
<p><i>Photodrame </i>was originally released in 1987, but it bears hallmarks that stretch back to the previous decade. The squalling ball of compact energy at the heart of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/640-cabaret-voltaire/"">Cabaret Voltaire</a>'s classic synth-abuse track <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-IixtxKETU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nag Nag Nag""</a> is occasionally mirrored, although Trop Tard were operating on a strict guitar/bass/drum machine set-up at the time. The overall sound appears to be a consequence of two forces colliding. For one, there's a punk-like amateurishness to the playing. <span>Philippe Lixtre's</span> bassline on ""La Mort Est Humaine"" is so loose and unrefined it feels like you're witnessing a musician learning to play in real time. Secondly, this was a home recording, with the tape hiss lending an appropriately decaying atmosphere to songs like the rare English language venture ""Johnny Is a Loser"". Sadly, it's unlikely we'll ever find out Trop Tard's true motivations. The people behind this music remain cloaked in mystery, with Sacred Bones only releasing this set by negotiating with the remaining living member through a third party. </p>
<p>One thing abundantly clear from <i>Photodrame </i>is that a large stack of pent-up anguish was offloaded into this music. The vocals from <span>Fabien Doe</span> are uncomfortably raw, from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22521-the-birthday-party/"">Birthday Party</a> howl drilled into the center of ""Le Chant Des Martyrs"" to the sheer surliness of ""Ma Folie Se Dessiner"". That sense of collapse, of witnessing someone pushed to the brink for their art, is something the band polished up when they got a chance to move beyond their debut. <i>Ils Etaient 9 Dans L'Obscurité</i>, released just a year later, is a pro effort in comparison. The playing and singing are both vastly improved, in the process removing some of the unease from their work. But the payoff is more satisfying here. ""Les Anges D'Aujourd'hui"" is artfully threaded between the bedsit pining of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3859-soft-cell/"">Soft Cell</a> and the screaming guitar sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7616-magazine/"">Magazine</a>, while ""Maman"" is masterfully drunken, hinting at frictional territory Trop Tard could have explored had the band enjoyed a greater shelf life.</p>

They hissed, they clapped, they drummed on their bellies, and moved in ways that you generally don't see in concert halls. The piece was called ""HandsFree""; the composer was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30651-anna-meredith/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Meredith</a>, a Scottish woman in her mid-30s. You don't need to know who Walton was or what his first symphony sounds like to understand how a bunch of teenagers yelling after it might prove refreshing.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Black Prince Fury</i>, Meredith's first EP as a solo musician, is playful, spirited, visceral, and smart. Aside from the pummeling brass section of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14090-nautilus/"" target=""_blank"">""Nautilus""</a> and an AOR rock sample in ""Never Wonder"" that is too good to spoil, the EP sounds like it was made entirely with drum machines and synthesizers all cut to sound flat, bright, tough and tiny-- the aural equivalent of <a href=""http://technabob.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/112-scale-rx78-2-gundam-2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">plastic toys</a>. It's easy to grab a hold of due to how much emphasis Meredith puts on rhythm. They aren't hummable, but they are drummable, snappable, and other impact-related forms of participation. Half the time it sounds like the real joy here for her was creating situations where she could play Tetris with her own polyrhtythms-- once brainy, always brainy.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">In her track review of ""Nautilus"", Laura Snapes compared Meredith's music to that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4850-planningtorock/"" target=""_blank"">Planningtorock</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5694-these-new-puritans/"" target=""_blank"">These New Puritans</a>, for whom Meredith has opened on tour. To my ears, Meredith's real ancestor is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23014-moondog/"" target=""_blank"">Moondog</a>, a New York street musician who also made tough, puzzling miniatures that drew as freely from the pop and jazz of his time as they did from what might have been more readily identified as ""classical music."" (Meredith has already been the composer-in-residence at the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and currently occupies the same position at the Royal Philharmonic Society.) Like Moondog, the character of Meredith's music is triumphant and warlike, but the scale of it is cartoonishly small-- most of the time it only sounds like the work of a few people working in a living room. </p>
<p class=""p1"">And like Moondog (or like the electronic producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2705-max-tundra/"" target=""_blank"">Max Tundra</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>'s first EPs) Meredith's music feels dense, busy and isolated, but essentially fun, as though it was designed first and foremost to amuse the people making it. At 18 minutes, <i>Black Prince Fury </i>is just a toe or two in the water; whether she'll make more is unclear, but considering how deadeningly self-serious the worlds of classical and electronic music can be, a few more teenagers drumming on their bellies would be a nice thing. </p></div>"|17400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17400-black-prince-fury/|7.2|Mike Powell

Coping with the loss of a bandmate, especially one as full of youth and vitality as their late vocalist Makh Daniels, seems like an insurmountable mountain to climb, and yet, these San Francisco boys have done their damnedest to overcome the worst. <i>Red Horse</i> marks their first recorded output since Daniels was killed in a van accident while the band was on tour with Funeral Pyre in 2010, and it paints the portrait of a young group that still has everything to prove to itself, if not to others. Hardened and honed by years of DIY touring and big-name support gigs, the songs ring true with real, agonizing pain and anger, felt on a more visceral level than your average emotionally detached death/grind crew can hope to scrape toward. On tracks like ""Misery"", ""Death Obsessed"", ""Pure Hell"", and the slow, sad collapse of album closer ""Quietus"", you can tell that they mean it, that every word and every chord has been ripped straight from the heart of their still-bleeding wounds.</p>
<p>Even when disregarding its backstory and focusing solely on the music at hand, <i>Red Horse</i> is impressive. It's a marked step forward from the kitchen-sink death/hardcore/crust/grind of their last LP, <i>Goner</i>, and a much more mature album overall. Early Graves haven't abandoned their many-headed hydra of influences, but they have figured out how to stitch them together into one cohesive blend. They don't sound like a mélange of other bands anymore; they sound like Early Graves, and that's a damn good band to sound like in 2012.</p>
<p><i>Red Horse</i> sees them experimenting more with melody and the dynamics of soft and loud. Album opener ""Skinwalker"" begins with a lone, spidery acoustic lead that carries through the whole song even as it builds into Early Graves' customary vitriolic metalpunk maelstrom; the same device repeats on the melancholy, sludgy ""Days Grow Cold"", as their trusty old Swedish death metal influence thrusts itself into the spotlight. The aforementioned ""Quietus"" feels like a goodbye, its initial furor spiraling down into a flurry of clear, gently captivating melodic riffing, and all points in between the two bear the mark of the band's fresh willingness to step even further past the box they'd smashed through years ago. The production is as raw and grainy as ever, aligning them more closely with their crusty heroes in 1990s Memphis stalwarts His Hero Is Gone and Swedish death tone gurus Entombed than with any of their shinier, more processed peers. </p>
<p>New vocalist John Strachan, a longtime friend who also sings for the Funeral Pyre, had big shoes to fill, and he did a commendable job both preserving Daniels' legacy of intensity and bringing his own caustic touches to the mic. Situated high in the mix for maximum impact, Strachan's vocal performance comes across as lonesome, ornery, and mean. His delivery perfectly suits the often chaotic tangle of sounds that his bandmates delight in creating, clawing through the walls of noise with a scratchy, raspy bellow bred by hardcore punk and honed by howling mockery at the cross in his black metal band.  </p>
<p>You've got to hand it to these guys. They pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, overcoming brutal tragedy and cutting loss. They refused to quit, and even managed to improve, remaining bloodied, but unbowed. This is their tribute to their fallen brother, and their statement of intent to the rest of the world. Early Graves are dead. Long live Early Graves.</p></div>"|17314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17314-red-horse/|7.4|Kim Kelly

Coming from a band that has been at times irritatingly proud of their own complexity, it's a refreshingly basic album. Of course, basic is a relative term. <i>Magellan</i> is still dense and fidgety, and Dave Longstreth still seems like a writer incapable of getting to the end of a song without proving that he and his bandmates are, in some capacity, beyond human. His tricks, though, are fewer and further between. Whether it's a product of age, epiphany, or just general exhaustion, I don't know, but it turns out that the less hysterically he and his band try to prove how talented they are, the more obvious their talent becomes. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Take <a href=""https://twitter.com/DavidLongstreth/status/260747969920389120"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent tweet</a> he wrote about ""While You're Here"", one of three new songs on the four-track <i>About to Die </i>EP: ""Hey, here's a song I wrote on the day of [late TV on the Radio bassist] Gerard Smith's wake in BK 2 summers ago. This song is for him. Miss u Gerry!"" The song itself is two minutes long, just Longstreth's voice and a string section. His knotty, chromatic sense of harmony is still there, and his voice-- that insistent animal yip-- is too. But as the strings resolve from dissonance to consonance, the point of the song is made unavoidably clear: ""While you are here you are alive."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">This is an easy, comforting, life-affirming statement that anyone can relate to. It's also the kind of statement Longstreth has spent 10 years avoiding. In a lot of ways, musical complexity-- and the high-minded shock value associated with it-- has been his crutch. At times, I have felt like the intended response to his music is to just say ""holy shit"" repeatedly until something else comes on, since it is difficult to think or feel anything when saying ""holy shit"" repeatedly. ""The hardest thing is to do something simple,"" he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8883-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">told us</a> in an interview this year. For Longstreth, this seems true. It's not that the music Dirty Projectors are making now is always simple, but when it is, it treats simplicity as a sign of confidence rather than lack of ideas. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The two other new songs that fill out the EP-- ""Here Til It Says I'm Not"" and ""Simple Request""-- sound like testing grounds for ideas that show up more substantively on <i>Magellan</i>. Handclaps, chiming folk-rock guitar, big, tumbling breaks ripped from Led Zeppelin: These are what anchor songs like ""Impregnable Question"", ""Offspring Are Blank"", and ""Swing Lo Magellan"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Listening to <i>About to Die</i>, the amount of effort Dirty Projectors put into <i>Magellan</i> only becomes more obvious. (In a way, this is almost a bad thing: The amount of effort they put into their albums is obvious already.) You can trust someone as bright, fussy and single-minded as Longstreth to know what belonged on it and what didn't. Still, fans will probably want to hear it. Fans will want to hear almost anything by a band so rare. Over the past few years they've gone from being a willful curiosity to collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"" target=""_blank"">David Byrne</a>, performances on late-night television, profiles in the <i>New York Times</i>, and endorsements from Jay-Z. This is a cherry on a cupcake. Grant them the happy little excess; they're too serious to ask for it.</p></div>"|17273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17273-about-to-die-ep/|7.3|Mike Powell

Mark McGuire continued to spool out guitar ambience, culminating in the highlight-reel <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15420-a-young-persons-guide-to-mark-mcguire/"">A Young Person's Guide to Mark McGuire</a></i>. Steve Hauschildt crafted a solid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16119-tragedy-geometry/"">solo record</a> of synth patterns, and has another due soon. And John Elliott's <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/release/SP+019"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Outer Space</a> project put out two stellar albums this year, while his Editions Mego sub-imprint <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/releases/spectrum-spools/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spectrum Spools</a> has been perhaps the most exciting underground label of 2012, supporting material by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29901-motion-sickness-of-time-travel/"">Motion Sickness of Time Travel</a>, <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/release/SP+017"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drainolith</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29301-gary-war/"">Gary War</a>.</p>
<p>Given all this activity, I expected the next proper Emeralds album to be filled with new ideas-- perhaps even overloaded with them. But <i>Just to Feel Anything </i>has the opposite problem. Smoothed and streamlined, it comes off as a retreat into the safety of genre. While there's nothing inherently wrong with Emeralds continuing to evoke the past, what made their earlier work so interesting was the way they tweaked and skewed influences in unpredictable ways. Hence they could breathe life into even the most hackneyed new age tropes.</p>
<p>Here, though, the soft shapes and cheesy tones of new age, post-rock, and even corporate music tend to subsume the band's personality. The result is well-executed and pleasant to listen to, but generally lacking edge or distinction. In places, it sounds like anyone could've made this, much the way music in TV commercials sounds crafted by a committee or an algorithm. Despite how reference-heavy their work has been, that's something I've never thought about any previous Emeralds-related release.</p>
<p>There are spots in the album's glossy haze where the band's originality pokes through. Generally this occurs when they eschew predictable beats. They nicely evoke the melancholy of mid-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a> on the drifting ""Through &amp; Through"", and offer dense layers in the drones of ""The Loser Keeps America Clean"". Strongest is eight-minute closer ""Search For Me in the Wasteland"", a patient guitar swirl that's like a languid, emotionally acute version of<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2402-labradford/""> Labradford</a>.</p>
<p>Variations on those compelling sounds persist in other parts of <i>Just to Feel Anything</i>, but they're dragged down by an odd dependence on straightforward drum machines. So opener ""Before Your Eyes"" starts with a tense atmosphere, but a flat rhythm transforms it into a empty take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"">Mogwai</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"">Explosions in the Sky</a>-style cinematics. The following cut, ""Adrenochrome"", uses a similarly vague thump, and despite some hypnotic grooves in the middle, ends with soaring guitars precariously close to corporate video territory.</p>
<p>Before you let that description scare you off, be advised that <i>Just to Feel Anything </i>is by no means a crass, calculated makeover. The sounds and styles here are ones that Emeralds have leaned toward in the past, and they're clearly committed to them aesthetically rather than as a pander to expand their audience. It's just that the smooth side of their style predominates, and isn't counterbalanced enough by more surprising elements.</p>
<p>Still, even the weakest moments here feel just a few moves away from something much more interesting. So rather than dismiss <i>Just to Feel Anything </i>as a mistake, perhaps it's better to think of it as a mixed detour, one that some of the band's followers might in fact welcome. Personally, I'm hopeful that the idiosyncrasies that marked past Emeralds efforts will make a comeback.</p></div>"|17276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17276-just-to-feel-anything/|5.9|Marc Masters

And yet apocalypse porn is more popular than ever. <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>,<i> The Walking Dead</i>,<i> Revolution</i>,<i> </i>Justin Cronin's <i>Passage </i>books-- our primal need to envision and confront the way the world ends continues to be fed by expensive, slickly produced, even rousing commercial entertainments. <i>Burning Daylight </i>by Seattle metal musician-cum-neo-folk singer-songwriter T.J.

<p><i>Burning Daylight</i>'s pitch-black narratives, set in charred landscapes where God and the Devil wage a final battle for supremacy, are superficially presented as nightmares, with Cowgill singing in a low, sinister croak pitched at a subterranean frequency somewhere between Johnny Cash at half the RPMs and a root beer belch. But like all apocalypse porn, <i>Burning Daylight</i> is really a fantasy about a world without complications, where it's still possible to tell what is truly good and what is not. For all the spooky, disembodied white noise and echoing haunted-house vocals he lays on top of his songs, Cowgill is at heart a 1950s nostalgist, a sort of undead Chris Isaak with a weakness of sock-hop balladry (see the heartfelt <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13926-you-can-break-my-heart/"" target=""_blank"">""You Can Break My Heart""</a>), chicken-scratch rockabilly (the hopped-up ""I Know You're Mine""), and twangy guitars that ring wondrously like church bells set against a full moon.</p>

""Like a wolf in troubled times I'm a sinner who loves his crimes/ I will kill every man who stands between me and the holy land,"" Cowgill sings on the Duane Eddy-goes-Dante rocker ""Holy Land"". Survival is what it boils down to in King Dude's universe, though in accordance with Cowgill's 50s influences, this life-and-death struggle carries over to a melodramatic fixation on sex and ""true"" love. There's also blues in <i>Burning Daylight</i>, particularly in how Cowgill conflates Satan with powerful, controlling women. On the gothic country song ""Barbara Anne"", he's driven to violence by desire"" ""I'll shoot that man in the head if he hurt you Barbara Anne,"" he promises. On the clattering ""I'm Cold"", he tries to one-up his witchy companion by bragging that he's ""livin' deep in Hell and you know I'm not sweatin' yet."" But Cowgill can't fully conceal the faith and even romanticism that burns at his core. ""I'm sorry to leave you but know that ol' Death ain't the end,"" he sings on the Leonard Cohen-like ""Lord, I'm Coming Home"". ""I will see you in the Kingdom of Light when our souls meet again.""</p>
<p><i>Burning Daylight </i>at times resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17139-the-tempest/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Dylan's <i>Tempest</i></a>,<i> </i>a similarly gravel-voiced meditation on death and love at the edge of existence. The comparison isn't particularly flattering for Cowgill, who strains a little too hard to sound evil with his beyond-his-years vocal affectations. Where Dylan's voice is actually constricted after a half-century of wear and tear, Cowgill's limitations seem self-imposed and one-note, both musically and conceptually. But even if <i>Burning Daylight </i>occasionally slips into shtick, Cowgill is still a good songwriter who can evoke a dark mood and the big, warm, beating heart underneath it.</p></div>"|17331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17331-burning-daylight/|6.9|Steven Hyden

In 2012, after releasing a handful of singles and a cassette, they showed up with two full-length albums, each with its own distinct sound. Their <a href=""http://outerminds.bandcamp.com/album/outer-minds-southpaw-lp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-titled album</a> on Southpaw painted them as <i>Nuggets</i> apostles; songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13415-gimmie-a-reason/"" target=""_blank"">""Gimmie a Reason""</a> had them slinging bubblegum psych melodies behind vintage reverb and this aesthetic fit with their confetti-throwing set from this year's Pitchfork Music Festival. But while there are songs just as catchy on <i>Behind the Mirror</i>, they're overshadowed by the band's dramatic shift in tone. Here, they aim for ""darker"" psych, favoring minor-key organ lines over bright, jangling guitar. </p>
<p>One thing that hasn't changed is their energy. ""Bohemian Grove"" opens with an organ played backwards, which establishes an unsettling vibe, but it breaks into a stomping, tambourine-filled garage banger. The album's highlight is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13875-we-are-all-stone/"">""We Are All Stone""</a>, which has the group shouting its vocals in unison. Zach Medearis' voodoo guitar riff is matched by Mary McKane's organ, Brian Costello sticks to the toms to create monolithic backbone alongside bassist A-ron Orlowski, and Gina Lira tests the structural integrity of her tambourine. It's a mid-album burst of force that's tempered by a mid-song cool down; naturally, they pick the energy back up for the track's final stretch. </p>
<p>That's the album at its best. But when Outer Minds push the spooky moodiness it can become tedious. ""Look Behind the Mirror"" is five minutes long but the song's ever-churning and too-repetitive tropes wear out their welcome after about three. And although the organ can inject mood, sometimes it's laid on too thick. The slow burning, Eastern-tinted guitar line from ""Charlemagne"" is smothered by the keyboard-- it feels like a missed opportunity. For an album with impressively fluid sequencing and transitions, the duds are all the more hollow and disappointing.</p>
<p>Still, the songwriting on <i>Mirror</i> is good enough to compensate for its missteps. Some of the album's most exciting moments come when they step away from the creepy mask on the album's cover and tap into their pop side, as on ""Pleasure Cruise"" and ""Cool Times"". They're upbeat tunes about having fun that showcase the band's knack for melody. It's commendable Outer Minds tried shifting the mood between records, but ultimately, <i>Mirror</i> shows where their strengths lie.</p></div>"|17268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17268-behind-the-mirror/|6.7|Evan Minsker

In some ways the cover art of the Vancouver metal group Bison B.C.'s fourth album does bring to mind the deep coloring and dreamy haziness of <i>Loveless</i>, but even that's a stretch: Unlike MBV's hazy pinks, these raw, bloody reds signal an obvious metal direction. Instead, <i>Lovelessness</i> is a muscular and expansive piece of stoner metal that seeks to challenge the laid-back, sluggish nature of the term. Like High on Fire, with whom <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bisoneastvan"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bison B.C.</a> toured in 2010, and who have also fought to shake from the shackles of being dubbed ""stoner metal,"" they're best seen as an exceptional metal group, no additional tags required.</p>
<p>Glancing at some of the tracks' extended running times, one might assume Bison B.C. are a vintage 70s throwback intent on jamming endlessly. But the only song that drifts into the blacklight badlands is ""Blood Music"", the longest and shaggiest of the tracks at just under 11 minutes: It begins with a Kyuss-style doom swing, then heads into more Hawkwindian territory. (How could those spacy screeches not be sampled from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10512-space-ritual-collectors-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Space Ritual</i></a>?) ""Last and First Things"" opens with a current of rolling power electronics that's buried enough to serve as an easy entry into the tribal drums that give way to tried-and-true high E leads, rather than a sonic overload. It sounds like a bad nightmare, but the difference is you know there's an end. If <i>Lovelessness</i> does have any real flaw, it's that those hisses aren't used enough.</p>
<p>Maybe, though, Bison B.C. know when enough is enough. There's plenty of evidence to suggest <i>Lovelessness </i>is built on solid songcraft and pummeling metal, not waste. Bassist Masa Anzai and current drummer Matt Wood, who replaced Brad MacKinnon, both served time in the underrated, short-lived sludge/grind hybrid group Goatsblood. As such, they, and the rest of Bison B.C., are versed in the power of the riff. ""Clozapine Dream"", clocking in at 3:16, is <i>Lovelessness</i>' representative track, in spite or because of the fact that it's the leanest. With its velocity, guitarist/vocalist James Farwell goes back to his roots in thrashers S.T.R.E.E.T.S., and it also helps that Wood is a former member of metal revivalists 3 Inches of Blood. That song, and ""An Old Friend"", are reminiscent of Mastodon before they got bigger recording budgets-- ambitious, but mindful of the conventions that work in metal.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Speaking of Mastodon, remember when metal was getting ""hip"" again, which was a bunch of bands trying to do what the Sword did? Behold, tired attempts of pretending Sabbath ended with Ozzy and lead guitar ended with the death of Phil Lynott. That wasn't pleasant, but with <i>Lovelessness</i>, Bison B.C. prove that rudimentary doesn't mean uninteresting or trendy. These songs just bring out the tongue lashes. Which is the point of this kind of metal.</p></div>"|17398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17398-lovelessness/|7.2|Andy O'Connor

""I can't even name a person I like in hip-hop,"" she <a href=""http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/talking-to-angel-haze/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> a <i>New York Times</i> reporter before her six-song <i>Classick EP</i> dropped for free online. ""[A]s time has gone on, hip-hop has become really redundant and repetitive. There is no point in listening to anything, because it all sounds the same and everyone is saying the same things.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">That's some sensationally broad shade to throw, echoing, oddly enough, the fuck-all-your-idols quotes that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler, the Creator</a> generated in his brashest early interviews two years ago. But Haze's comments also reveal precisely why it's been so thrilling to watch her come into her own over the past year: They show off her fierce independence, her outsized ambition (see the hook of a then-unknown Haze's debut mixtape's best song, ""New York""), and her simmering spirit of revolt. They're also well-earned. <i>Reservation</i>, the solid, 14-song mixtape released this July, introduced Haze as a promising new voice in hip-hop, one whose agile, volcanic flow was equal parts heart-on-sleeve confessionalism and weathered survivor's grit. It's <i>Classick</i>, though, that announces her desire-- and better yet, potential-- to change the whole game.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That's mostly due to the EP's highlight and obvious talking point, ""Cleaning Out My Closet"". Released a few days in advance of the mixtape, the track describes in searingly vivid detail just what makes Haze a survivor: it's about a series of rapes she endured beginning at age 7. ""I was just a toddler or kid, and he wasn't the first to successfully try what he did,"" she raps, each word landing like a dagger hurled through the haunting atmosphere of Eminem's familiar track. ""It was weird because I felt like I was losing my mind, and then it happened like it happened like millions of times/And I would swear that I would tell but they would think I was lying,"" she continues, her delivery charged with the power of a long-held, finally blurted secret. Just as chilling as the graphic description of abuse, though, is the song's second half, which finds Haze cataloguing the psychological damage she dealt with in the wake of the trauma. ""I started starving myself, fucked up my bodily health,"" she confesses. ""I didn't wanna be attractive to nobody else.""  </p>
<p class=""p1"">""Cleaning Out My Closet""'s power is its plainspoken clarity. In music as in society writ large, rape is an evil often cloaked in euphemism and distanced through metaphor (think of the recent stir about Missouri Congressman Todd Akin's befuddled concept of ""legitimate rape,"" or the more generalized terms ""abuse"" and ""molestation"" <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/post/after-jerry-sandusky-lets-say-the-tough-words-out-loud/2012/06/25/gJQAjUR21V_blog.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that some activists boycott</a>). But the power of ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" comes from the way Haze forces the listener to confront the realities in lucid detail. After a particularly graphic line, she throws us this aside, ""Disgusting? Right, now, let that feeling ring through your guts""-- and it does, every word. In less able hands, such a loaded topic-- especially when addressed so early in an artist's career-- could be mishandled in any number of ways. But the fact that Haze can turn an unspeakable horror into such a thoughtful and articulately powerful song speaks volumes about her agile skills. ""Closet"" is an unforgettable four and a half minutes of music that leaves you feeling emotionally spent but also comforted to be in the care of an expert, fearless storyteller.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And though it's been obvious headline-bait, there's more to <i>Classick</i> than ""Cleaning Out My Closet"". Of almost equal intensity is the opening cut, Haze's take on Lupe Fiasco's controversial ""Bitch Bad"". As ever, Haze's hyper-real lyrical snapshots are more concerned with life than other people's art. While Fiasco's somewhat muddled message blames hip-hop for fueling the sexualization of young girls and sees women as disempowered victims of its influence, Haze's version flips the script, asking us to consider men as potential victims too. ""To sit and stay, she learned it from her mother,"" she says, ""But imagine how it all affected her little brother."" Though she raps about empowerment, obstacles, and overcoming systemic oppression, Angel Haze is not trying to censor or tailor her identity to fit into the often alienating ""conscious hip-hop"" box. Hers is a hard-won positivity, one that sheds light on dark truths and complex problems but never patronizes or moralizes. </p>
<p class=""p1"">And anyway, she's too much of an entertainer for that. Despite the heavy themes, there are moments on <i>Classick</i> when Haze lets her guard down, whether it's focusing her humor on her version of Missy Elliott's ""Gossip Folks"" (""I heard Angel Haze grew up in a pothole... I heard the bitch deep-throated two lizards and an anaconda"") or sitting out a high note on the chorus of ""Doo Wop (That Thing)"" (""Man, fuck that part,"" she laughs). Her take on the Lauryn Hill classic is actually the weakest moment here, only because its spirit sticks so close to the original. It feels a little like an ambitious aspiring artist tracing over one of her idol's most vibrant paintings; the leap from, say, Hill's ""Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem"" to Haze's ""Don't be treated like a 5 when you really are a 10"" show that there's still room for her lyricism to grow. But just the fact that she's drawing fresh inspiration from Hill is enough. Hip-hop's still got a huge L-Boogie-shaped void, and Haze feels like the first new artist in a while with the personality and talent to potentially fill it in her own way.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As Angel Haze preps her major label debut for the spring, there's one big uncertainty: her beats. The tracks on <i>Reservation</i> pivoted from Timbaland-lite minimalism to cloud rap puffs to the occasional acoustic-guitar tinged misstep (one worrisome thing that <i>New York Times</i> interview revealed: a troubling affinity for Jason Mraz and Train-- yes,<i> that</i> Train-- that sort of retroactively explains some of <i>Reservation</i>'s incongruently breezy, Beats By Mraz flair). It seemed to try a little of everything in search of sonic vocabulary that makes sense for Haze. Still, her two strong mixtapes have let us witnessing her becoming: even if Angel Haze's sound hasn't arrived fully formed, her ferocious talent is obvious. ""I'm shaping myself up for the crossover,"" she said to the <i>Times</i>, citing vocal and guitar lessons and her love of pop and rock. But <i>Classick</i> shows so clearly why hip-hop needs her: given the ease with which she can pull poetry out of its darkest corners and challenge its most enduring taboos, Haze has quickly become one of its greatest and most progressive hopes.</p></div>"|17402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17402-classick/|7.6|Lindsay Zoladz

Then he holed up and recorded the 2011 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15988-total-decay-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Total Decay</i></a> EP, again by his lonesome. A year later, you might think he'd bring along his road-tested band for the sophomore album, <i>Zeros</i>, but no, he stuck to the same process outside of a solitary trip to Monte Vallier's Ruminator Audio studio after six months of arranging the record in his apartment.</p>
<p>All of Vasquez's material's been darkly enveloping and fuzzed-out, but with <i>Zeros</i> you can hear him projecting to an audience. He has such a specific vision that, in the same way <i>Total Decay</i> felt like a heavier, more nihilistic extension of <i>The Soft Moon</i>, <i>Zeros</i> comes together like a swarming continuation of <i>Total Decay</i>'s suffocating goth-tinged synth-driven post-punk. You get krautrock's motorik rhythms and Suicide's bleak nihilism in poppier form.</p>
<p>In general, the Soft Moon are less song-based, more sound-based and image-based (in an earlier incarnation, visual artist Ron Robinson was considered part of the band). That said, each collection features a couple of dark-hearted anthems: On <i>The Soft Moon</i> it was ""Out of Time"" and closer ""Tiny Spiders"", on <i>Total Decay</i> it was the swirling, heaving title track. Here we have the taunting, spiraling ""Machines"", the mid-tempo Joy Division-as-dream-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14226-insides/"" target=""_blank"">""Insides""</a>, the shuffling, deeply percussive title track, and the pulsing, appropriately titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14043-die-life/"" target=""_blank"">""Die Life""</a>. Comparisons to the Soft Moon's previous material are hard to avoid, but it's also difficiult to cite diminishing returns because Vasquez is<i> </i>so consistent. (At all levels: The debut was released toward the end of November.<i> Total Decay</i> came out on Halloween. This one, fittingly, came out on Hell Night. The message here: <i>This is fall music</i>.)</p>
<p>Vasquez's knack for atmosphere was there from the beginning, but he's becoming a better, more defined songwriter. Even scene-setting instrumentals like the driving ""Remember the Future"" seem to have more shape. Interestingly, despite looking outward, he's submerged his louder vocals deeper into the mix, offering them as another instrument, not the upfront howl of a ""lead singer."" We get whispers, soft shouts, distant screams, heavy breathing, and it helps to create a dense, hermetic whole.</p>
<p>The last song on <i>Zeros</i>, ""ƨbnƎ ƚI"", bookends (and mirrors) the howling, apocalyptic opener ""It Ends"". In interviews, Vasquez's said he wanted to make one more album by himself before expanding to a full-band recording. This is that final solo album. It'll be curious to see what happens if he does decide to open up the laboratory and welcome in his supporting cast. The claustrophobic intensity of the current one-man format could lessen, but his songwriting skills are stronger now than they were two years ago and his aesthetic's deep enough that there's probably room enough for more people in those shadows.</p></div>"|17207.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17207-zeros/|7.0|Brandon Stosuy

Existing between 1990 and 1993, their vocalist Rebecca Rawlings and multi-instrumentalists Scott Purnell and Jamie Gingell produced melodic, ethereal shoegaze so quintessential and poised that fans of the genre could become attached with magnetic force. But the allure of Dreamscape's obscurity is also so radically cool that it begs to remain untouched. The Kranky label, with its bare-bones reissue, has done a fine job of maintaining this group's mystery in compiling a nine-song survey of its microscopic discography. While there's something enticing about such well-styled dream pop going criminally unnoticed for two decades, <i>La-Di-Da</i> doesn't need the crutch of enigma.</p>
<p>The reissue is presented virtually without context, save for a tiny footnote that Purnell and Gingell considered Dreamscape a side-project to their Secret Shine endeavor, an admittedly derivative MBV-worshipping guitar band on pioneering Bristol indie pop outpost Sarah Records. (The final Dreamscape recordings happened to coincide with Secret Shine's 1993 debut, <i>Untouched</i>.) In the absence of an assigned Dreamscape narrative, though, we can create our own. We can picture the band holing up in some musty, low-lit attic, constructing perfectly hermetic, gothic pop for its own sake. We can insert ourselves into their process and color their intentions, letting our imaginations run like lucid dreams. We can imagine authenticity unencumbered by expectation and art created purely.</p>
<p>Or we can speculate the far less romantic but equally probable notion that Dreamscape were trying to sign with 4AD, the label from whom the band cleverly culled its broad palette. The most immediate comparison is shoegazing alternative rock band Lush, in their early <i>Spooky</i> period. There are hints of Cocteau Twins' gothic atmosphere pushed through a more pronounced singer-songwriter filter, occasionally complemented by bright, subtle flecks of piano. Unlike the typically indecipherable Liz Fraser, Rawlings' words, often cryptic or jaded, contribute to the album's dark spirit; more a royal shade of purple than black. Complex harmonies shift from deadpan to sing-song, contributing a muted sense of drama. Rounding out the sound are bits of droning experimentalism not unlike those implemented by the signature 4AD act, This Mortal Coil. Dreamscape might be the most archetypal 4AD band that never was. Their sound hasn't gathered a fleck of dust.</p>
<p><i>La-Di-Da</i> is divided in two: the first four tracks, more immediate pop and shoegaze structures, were meant to feature on a never-released 1993 album called <i>Greater Than God </i>for the local Bristol label <a href=""http://www.twee.net/labels/ladida.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La-Di-Da Productions</a>, allegedly called off because Dreamscape <a href=""http://www.secretshine.co.uk/releases/greater-than-god"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">would not signed a three-record deal</a> (although Kranky founder Joel Leoschke managed to acquire a tape 20 years ago). That half soars upward with the heavenly, restrained tones of ""Separate Sense"", mounting thick atmosphere before a tense, haunting, and near a cappella detour: ""So there's blood in your eye now, oh what a shame,"" Rawlings narrates, a beguiling and cooly masked threat. ""I think I will finish while you're down."" The melodic guitar-sphere ascends quickly back up; an instant dream-pop classic. Later hypnotic chords churn through ""Soft Fists"" and lead to a death-march drumbeat and gruesome lines that work a similar dynamic: ""You're very still/ I'm dripping in your blood,"" Rawlings whispers with an eery, menacing air. ""I'm very glad/ As the clock it turns to one.""</p>
<p>Dreamscape's more expansive 1992 <i>Cradle</i> EP, released via La-Di-Da and constituting the reissue's second half, is epitomized by its title track: a criss-crossing patchwork of impressively stacked harmonies and skeletal guitars that form an orchestrated collage of sound. It all builds to dark, droning sacred music in the vein of Arvo Pärt. ""Dreamsleep Eternal"", meanwhile, is an interstellar masterpiece of mystic instrumentation and hymn-like vocals that strives for something boundless and epic; its ending meditation might recall the more recent works of minimal avant-pop artist Julia Holter. Deep and explorative, ""Dreamsleep Eternals""'s introductory and concluding bits of drone make it a piece with no true beginning or end, much like the O.G. Theater of Eternal Music itself.</p>
<p><i>La-Di-Da</i>, both classic-sounding and inventive, ought to confirm Dreamscape a spot in the canon of early shoegaze innovators. A beautiful thing about ""lost"" records like this is recognizing the odds were stacked against your ever discovering them-- it's only through fate that their notes and tones didn't end up alone on some odd dusty cassette, fading over time in a shoebox on a closet shelf. But there's wonder, too, in music existing in time purely for its process of creation. It can make you want to do the same, even if no one ever hears it.</p></div>"|17204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17204-la-di-da-recordings/|8.1|Jenn Pelly

Atriarch 2012 seem to be a gristmill for topical and musical heaviness, churning out songs about the corruption of salvation and the endless quest for renewal above a soundtrack that cuts from Swans to Darkthrone, Celtic Frost to the Fall. The despondency of ""Cursed"" comes projected onto slinking doom, baritone vocals stretched over a Melvins-sized creep. While ""Offerings"" burns out on a black metal rampage, it fades away with an atmospheric denouement; that transition, mind you, comes after a passage that sounds a bit like Mark E. Smith fronting a viscous math-rock outfit. Though opener ""Parasite"" begins with a long and looming spoken-word section concerning power struggles and fallen idols, it eventually emerges as a hardcore anthem fit for fans of Fucked Up. Slanted guitars and roiling drums bolster Smith's call for revolution: ""Will a change call for a fight? This is war.""</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>Ritual of Passing</i> is so bleak that its four-minute epilogue-- an ancient Hindu text lifted <a href=""http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/ftu/ftu04.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">from the Upanishads</a> and intoned over a wafting chorus and visceral drones-- feels redundant, a cheap horror-show reel shown after the truly scary stuff ends. Fright is what Atriarch do best. In only two years, they've started to find that rarified space where the anxiety of their ideas is manifest within the coils of their music. Like Swans and even Eyehategod before them, they've started to <i>sound</i> as tough as their themes suggest they might; when Smith says you should be trembling or troubled, don't be surprised if you actually are.</p>
<p>For all of <i>Ritual of Passing</i>'s malevolence, there are backlit layers of hard-won redemption and hardline self-reckoning, too. Smith takes aim at hypocrites and unfounded hope, but he carefully works in mechanisms for, at the very least, being better than them. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14275-altars/"" target=""_blank"">""Altars""</a>, for instance, aims to dismantle religious icons wholesale, to shrug off symbols that, as he puts it, ""bear witness to this tyranny."" The sound matches the script, with guitars that cut like rusty, serrated blades and a bassline that creeps with suspicion. But during the last minute, the instruments relax, and Smith comes up for air, ostensibly sobered on solidarity: ""You who are my enemy/ I embrace you as my brother,"" he says twice. Traces of the same hopeful sentiment appear in the darkest of places; ""Parasite"" calls for open hearts and minds, while, as the title suggests, ""Altruist"" calls for selflessness while demanding that the toughest choices about life and liberty (""Which side are you on?"") be made now. At one point, he even seeks forgiveness for the complacency of ""a normal life."" He's not above his own scorn.</p>
<p><i>Ritual of Passing</i>'s only true shortcoming is Atriarch's restlessness; that is, these 40 minutes can sometimes feel like a seesaw of upheaval, volleying between directions and references at a pace that's unsettling. Part of that stems from Smith's chameleonic abilities as a vocalist; in short order, he's capable of sounding like a pugnacious bar-rock frontman, a black metal belter, and <a href=""http://vimeo.com/9050795"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))'s stateside vocalist</a>. Considering their slim discography, though, these are healthy problems for Atriarch to have. After a relatively humdrum start, <i>Ritual of Passing</i> is a gauntlet of ideas and enthusiasms by a band with the tenacity to make good on most all of them. They might scare the hell out of you in the process.</p></div>"|17289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17289-ritual-of-passing/|7.6|Grayson Currin

Reker was a dancer and a guitarist in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"" target=""_blank"">David Byrne</a>'s touring band; Fasano was drumming for globalist art-pop giants <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5506-yeasayer/"" target=""_blank"">Yeasayer</a>. They must have sensed similar yearnings in each other, because they soon split off to form <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30793-people-get-ready/"" target=""_blank"">People Get Ready</a>, an ""interdisciplinary"" band that accompanies their music with choreographed live dance performance. Watching <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liEVZgeiZao&amp;feature=player_embedded"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this clip</a> gives a sense of the purposefully quirky performance-art vibe they're striving for. If it veers a little too closely to the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so9U5Fu4v2k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interpretive dance sequence</a> in <i>The Big Lebowski</i>, it is at least unique and striking, something that might stop you in your tracks if you passed it on the street.</p>
<p>But <i>People Get Ready</i>, as we have it here, is an album, one with no visual aids except whatever browser tabs you might have open. Left to vie for your attention the way all albums have to, it succeeds only fitfully. People Get Ready play jagged, melodic, technically accomplished indie rock, a kind that encourages exactly the kind of all-limbs-no-hips movement you can find at, say, about 2:01 of the above clip. The songs' itchy emotional temperament and Reker's quavering tenor call to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a>, and you can also hear both of Reker and Fasano's previous projects floating through the album's 37 minutes. What you can't hear, at least not yet, is the forging of a compelling, unique voice. </p>
<p>The album is most striking when the band members steer their brightly colored bounce into unguarded explosions. On brainy, visceral polyrhythmic workouts like ""Orange Grove"", where they're pummeling every hard surface you can imagine, any tension implied erupts into a dazzling electric storm. People Get Ready are masterful arrangers, filling the songs with small corners in which to get lost: I noticed the palm-muted guitar murmuring away behind the church organ and synthesizers of ""Orange Grove"" and couldn't stop tracking it.</p>
<p>Produced by the composer and arranger <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30504-jherek-bischoff/"" target=""_blank"">Jherek Bischoff</a>, <i>People Get Ready</i> sounds fantastic, and the members have a way with small riffs and details that act like hooks by themselves. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14489-middle-name/"" target=""_blank"">""Middle Name""</a> is a ballad with a pensive heart and caffeinated pulse you can hear in the nervously chittering maracas. The guitar line on ""Mr. Shoulders"" feels like a surf-rock riff that has been twisted around itself like a wire.</p>
<p><i>People Get Ready</i> is packed with these sorts of details, but Reker's catholic tastes and facility let the album glide around a little too smoothly without an anchor. Maybe as a dance piece, Reker and Fasano's gawky, sheepishly enthusiastic aesthetic shines through more clearly, but too much of their debut album streams by without registering as more than ""pleasant."" You can hear the glints of their vision in the album's smaller moments, though, and on the closing ballad ""A Squandering"", Reker invites us behind the looking glass, reminding us that this album is really just an excuse, and an invitation, to stand up and move: ""We walked in, and they were playing/ That new record a'squandering/ We couldn't help... you know... dancing.""</p></div>"|17313.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17313-people-get-ready/|6.3|Jayson Greene

If March's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16356-break-it-yourself/"">Break It Yourself</a></i> was his violin album, full of careful pop-leaning arrangements, then <i>Hands of Glory</i> is its fiddle complement. It's a set of rustic songs born of his old-timey live sets as well as the loose sessions at his barn in western Illinois, on the banks of the Mississippi River. Bird and his band cover country tunes, strip down their own originals, and explore such weighty Biblical issues as death and resurrection, sin and salvation, creation and Armageddon.</p>
<p><i>Hands of Glory</i> possesses an almost academic quality, as though Bird and his cohorts were presenting a musical essay about endtimes imagery in country music. The album begins with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47944-new-andrew-bird-three-white-horses/"" target=""_blank"">""Three White Horses""</a>, which, thanks to Bird's bowing, sounds like it's coming from an old acetate. That song is followed by a cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4804-the-handsome-family/"" target=""_blank"">the Handsome Family</a>'s ""When That Helicopter Comes"", an oddball gospel that deploys Alan Hampton's bouncy bass and Bird's otherworldly bow as a soundtrack to separatist paranoia: ""There'll be power in the blood, when the helicopters come."" Bird switches theologies for ""Orpheo"", an austere reimagining of the spry ""Orpheo Looks Back"" from <i>Break It Yourself</i>, which thrives on the empty spaces between the strums and plucks, such that his gentle falsetto at the end has a beseeching effect. Only ""Railroad Bill"", with its aw-shucks lyrics hoots and hollers, sounds out of place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Bird thrives in this setting, which permits greater emphasis on his stoic vocals and curious playing. He intuits <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4456-townes-van-zandt/"" target=""_blank"">Townes Van Zandt</a>'s ""If I Needed You"" as a kind of secular hymn, directed to an ambivalent God rather than to a departed lover. His vocal cadence and mournful Appalachian airs evoke not so much a spiritual crisis but its resolution-- a place of relative peace after so much soul searching. Those same qualities bolster the inventive storytelling on ""Spirograph"", originally by the Minneapolis band Alpha Consumer. It's neither old nor country, but Bird treats it with the same care he might bring to a dusty ballad.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Thematically and perhaps musically, closer ""Beyond the Valley of the Three White Horses"" is intended to evoke some sort of afterlife. It's a lovely set of loops<span class=""s1"">-- l</span>ong bows, staccato plucks, airy strumming, and ominous ambience<span class=""s1"">-- that draw equally from fiddle styles as well as violin styles, making it the most intriguing use of Bird's instrument on the EP</span>. It's also the longest song on the album, unraveling gradually while never quite settling on one specific mood or theme. Instead, Bird constantly alters the shape of the <span class=""s1"">composition</span>, introduces new ideas, and lets them morph and mutate with each repetition. This technique is not necessarily new for Bird, but ""Beyond"" is a moment of subdued rapture, and, like the most bracing passages on <i>Hands of Glory</i>, it's one that arises from the way in which Bird's instrument inventively fuses these two disparate styles.</p></div>"|17209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17209-hands-of-glory/|7.3|Stephen M.

Boots Riley, leader of the radical Oakland rap group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/840-the-coup/"" target=""_blank"">the Coup</a>, has raged longer and harder than most, but somehow, on sixth album <i>Sorry to Bother You</i>, he sounds as nimble, funny, and wry as ever. There are a few signs of strain-- that self-deprecating album title, for one, which is a far cry from the incitement of 1998's <i>Steal This Album</i>. And occasionally, Riley acknowledges that making rebellious party rap to fight the system is the definition of pissing in the wind: ""I could rhyme silk with cigarettes/ I could rhyme Jack Daniels with triumph/ But no sentence I could spit could've shifted events,"" he raps on ""My Murder, My Love"". But even conceding defeat, Riley sounds anything but defeated. </p>
<p><i>Sorry to Bother You</i> continues the band's push into full-blown funk-rock, begun in earnest on 2006's <i>Pick a Bigger Weapon</i>. These are rough stylistic waters, but Riley and his band steer us through safely: On opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14045-the-magic-clap/"" target=""_blank"">""The Magic Clap""</a>, Riley invokes the harder gangsta-rap meaning of ""make it clap"" while the hard-charging band, working up a driving fuzz-bass groove that recalls Sly Stone's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiIBwu2mjs0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dance to the Music</a>"", implies the more old-fashioned kind. ""You Are Not a Riot"" is an unlikely fusion of shouting, twitchy punk-rap, and seething <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"" target=""_blank"">Elvis Costello</a> new wave. ""Your Parents' Cocaine"" recruits Justin Sane from Anti-Flag for a snotty pop-punk singalong mocking spoiled rich kids.</p>
<p>Holding all of this together, as always, is Riley's sharp humor. ""You Are Not a Riot"" is an acrid takedown of a fashionable faux-rebel, and every line he reels off pierces like a fountain-pen nib to the eyeball. ""You, you are not rebellion/ You are a sitcom based on a torture chamber,"" he sneers. The disarmingly tender ballad ""Violet"", meanwhile, is a fond remembrance of a transcendent night with a woman, and Riley's language sings with the same beauty as the strings and French horn: ""Skyscrapers crowded around to watch/ As we laughed at the faulty perception of clocks."" </p>
<p>Politically, Riley is still reporting from a world where there is ""a salary cap on a birth certificate,"" (""The Magic Clap"") and those paying close attention to his words will be rewarded by righteous screeds like this one, from ""The Gods of Science"": ""Some pray to the Christ, look to Buddha or Mohammed/ Some pray to the crack of a rich man's pocket/ The biggest advance was plumbing to the projects, now the scientific process got hijacked for profit."" Heavy words, but Riley skips them across the song's nervous four-note post-punk guitar riff, and they disappear into the blur of the groove. The Coup have always been a party band first and foremost, and <i>Sorry to Bother You</i> reaffirms their belief that the revolution, if there is going to be one, will start at the hips.</p>
<p>Riley and the Coup have always thrived on rap's margins, seemingly immune to whatever else is happening in the genre at the moment. Independent rap is more alive with talent right now than at any point in years, but the idiosyncratic guest roster of <i>Sorry to Bother You</i> reflects little more than Riley's idiosyncratic interests-- Anti-Flag, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2226-japanther/"" target=""_blank"">Japanther</a> on ""Long Island Iced Tea, Neat"". It isn't until the final track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14457-wavip-ft-das-racist-and-killer-mike/"" target=""_blank"">""WAVIP""</a>, that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"" target=""_blank"">Killer Mike</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a> show up, and it's for a tossed-off, one-take-style goof: Mike snarls, Kool A.D. mumbles, and Heems deadpans, ""I'm pretty great, you should be like me."" A bassline wobbles on two notes, and the song is over and out in less than three minutes. It feels like a funny afterthought, as well as a missed opportunity. But if an allergy to the obvious route is part of what has kept Boots vital all these years, we'll take it.</p></div>"|17211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17211-sorry-to-bother-you/|7.2|Jayson Greene

For a show all parties involved knew was final, it's jarring how composed McGarrigle sounds, relishing every detail of wicked underground husbands and famine-wracked earth. If there's familial subtext, you'd hardly know it from her delivery. But Wainwright's recording is full of such subtext: the sound is spare and lonely, like she's actually wandering the tundra, and quavery with regret. When she cries out, it's as if there aren't words to express her grief. It's an old technique, but Wainwright's earned the right to claim it.</p>
<p>It's inevitable that <i>Come Home to Mama</i> dwells on loss, considering how central family ties are to Wainwright's music. The album's full of imagined talks from mother to child or vice versa. There's the rambling meditation ""All Your Clothes"", where Wainwright wanders from topic to topic in verses of disconnected thoughts (""The baby's doing fine, my marriage is failing, but I keep trying all the time""), like she's pretending she's talking to someone other than ghostly backup vocals. She pretends she hears a response, too, on ""Proserpina"" and hushed album closer ""Everything Wrong"", which adds her own child to the conversation. ""I don't want you to feel alone, but you probably will when you are older,"" she says, amid a speech that's half encouragement and half defeated confession. It's hard to tell exactly who's the addressee: her son, or herself.</p>
<p>Loneliness aside, <i>Come Home to Mama</i> is not a somber affair. Credit's partly due to new producer Yuka Honda from Cibo Matto, who freshens up the sound considerably. Still, this is a Martha Wainwright album, so a few listeners will expect the saucy songwriter behind titles like ""Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole"", ""I Know You're Married, But I've Got Feelings, Too"", and ""Bleeding All Over You"". They'll be satisfied early on here, whether from Wainwright following ""the seven-year itch"" on track one with its choicest rhyme or beginning the next song, ""Can You Believe It"", with the wry ""I really like the makeup sex, it's the only kind I ever get."" It's an obvious attention-grabber but only the first of an onslaught of self-deprecating lines, crammed almost back-to-back. These would come off cheaply prurient without Wainwright's matter-of-fact delivery; she performs the song like a comedy routine that works because the speaker thinks she's just spilling facts, sly or wide-eyed or earnest or anything but a joke on herself.</p>
<p>But none of Wainwright's songs would quite work without her delivery. For all the attention that's been given over the years to her flailing turns of phrasing and melisma, she's at her most powerful when she's restrained. There's nothing remotely ""histrionic"" about closer ""Everything Wrong"", and it's deliberate: The song's all about stuffing down the angst that's pervaded the album. By the final line, Wainwright is barely audible above the mix, speaking like a confidence: ""I have been really, really sad-- except for having you with your dad."" As an expression of motherhood-- whose, it barely matters-- it's hard to imagine anything better.</p></div>"|17181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17181-come-home-to-mama/|7.5|Katherine St. Asaph

Three decades ago, as a member of Marine Girls and on her debut solo album, Thorn nailed a strain of wispy, ramshackle, beach-themed guitar-pop that was halfway between Young Marble Giants and the Raincoats, predicting the likes of Cub, the Softies, and even Best Coast. With her husband Ben Watt in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1375-everything-but-the-girl/"" target=""_blank"">Everything But the Girl</a> (and as a guest vocalist on Massive Attack's still-stunning <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epgo8ixX6Wo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Protection""</a>), she applied that minimalism to a jazzier, more sophisticated, and more electronics-friendly approach, coming up alongside Sade in a lineage that has most recently given us the xx, Jessie Ware, and Sky Ferreira (on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14138-everything-is-embarrassing/"">""Everything Is Embarrassing""</a>, at least). Thorn's last solo LP, 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14297-love-and-its-opposite/"">Love and Its Opposite</a></i>, was a richly melancholic album that should please fans of recent releases by Jens Lekman or Jonathan Richman.</p>
<p>Thorn has a unique, smoky voice, expressive and poised and cozily English all at once-- a fine mix of attributes for any caroler. Still, with the exception of a frankly gorgeous strings-and-piano rendition of 1944's ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" that should be an instant addition to your yuletide playlists, Thorn mostly goes for nontraditional fare on <i>Tinsel and Lights</i>. Her arrangements are neatly varied, from homey brass parts to frosty electro-pop; her song selections are impressively eclectic, ranging from country divas and 70s singer-songwriters to more recent indie icons; and <i>Love and Its Opposite</i> collaborator Ewan Pearson's colorfully muted production is virtually faultless. But a Christmas record is different from other albums-- though you might only play it a few weeks each year, you want to play it all the way through, maybe multiple times in quick succession-- and the moments of goodness and light here bump up against plenty of songs that are depressing or otherwise unseasonal-feeling. You're happy to get the present, but it's not exactly what you would've asked for from Santa.</p>
<p>After the quaintly vernacular ""Merry Little Christmas"", Thorn's most rewarding <i>Tinsel and Lights</i> tracks are also the most lighthearted, such as her crisp, slinky reworking of the White Stripes' ""In the Cold, Cold Night"" that wonderfully transforms the <i>Elephant</i> original into a sort of electro-<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGb5IweiYG8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fever""</a> for the ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" season. Piano-based ""Joy"" (""That's why, that's why/ The carols make you cry"") and the waltzing, vaguely ""Fairytale of New York""-like title track are the lone originals, and they set the conflicted but honestly sentimental, adult-romantic tone. Elsewhere, Thorn's urbane take on Dolly Parton's downtrodden but sassy <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCguQ1_wqVM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hard Candy Christmas""</a> somewhat calls to mind the Sundays' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHsip5xOenQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Here's Where the Story Ends""</a>, and her harrowed <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OCdS5S20dg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sister Winter""</a> revamps one of Sufjan Stevens' best ""Christmas"" songs.</p>
<p>If Thorn's take on the traditional tune and her White Stripes cover demand a place in the overcrowded holiday canon, the several sleepier and more downcast songs here don't quite. Scritti Politti's Green Gartside, with his syrupy coo, is a welcome holiday visitor on an electronic cover of Low's ""Taking Down the Tree"", but the song selection only underlines how special that slowcore band's beautifully bleak Christmas album really was. <i>Tinsel and Lights</i>' Stephin Merritt-written ""Like a Snowman"" is exquisitely sung and put together, but lacks the Magnetic Fields mastermind's usual clever bite; Thorn's Ron Sexsmith cover, ""Maybe This Christmas"", unfortunately verges on the drippiness of the schmaltzy <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmF2rsDHOZc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Grown-Up Christmas List""</a>.</p>
<p>With Everything But the Girl, Thorn and Watt (who plays guitar on a couple of tracks here) already recorded the ideal sort of Christmas song for their understated yet unashamedly tender approach. From 1994's <i>Amplified Heart</i>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS3IeUIQJTI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""25th December""</a> is a reverby, detail-strewn reflection on Christmases past. The old man plays the piano, the aunties and uncles are there, and then suddenly the kid's an adult, there are tears, and somehow it's too late for... something. ""No, I never ever realized,"" Watt sings, with Thorn in poignant harmony. A new version of this song will appear on the vinyl edition of <i>Tinsel and Lights</i>.

Vessel is one of many monikers used by Bristol resident Seb Gainsborough, who has gained some momentum via a series of 12""s released over the past year. None of those offered an indication of just how wide open his vision would become on this debut full-length. His music falls roughly into the tenuous category of ""non-dance dance music,"" although he's not averse to constructing tracks that are eminently danceable. This album's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13873-court-of-lions/"">""Court of Lions""</a> offers up a quietly euphoric type of mazy techno that feels made for huge sound systems.</p>
<p>Of those prior releases, 2011's <i>Wax Dance</i> EP occasionally circled the plastic haze of chillwave, perhaps offering a clue as to why Gainsborough ended up releasing <i>Order of Noise</i> on <a href=""http://tri-anglerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tri Angle</a>. Many of those rougher edges were smoothed over on the title track of the <i>Standard</i> EP from earlier this year, although <i>Order of Noise</i> goes some way to reclaiming them. Gainsborough's music as Vessel has already gained comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"">Actress</a>, and it's not hard to see why. Like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16544-actress-rip/"">R.I.P.</a>,</i> this is an album that requires listeners to put in some work, to extract their own sense of logic and rhythm from its scattershot surface. The path from the leaden bong fug of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14217-stillborn-dub/"">""Stillborn Dub""</a> through to the light and bloopy ""Lache"" isn't apparent at first, especially as the latter veers off on so many tangents; around the midway point, it feels like an entirely separate track has encroached, ushering in a whole wave of contrasting feelings.</p>
<p>That particular part in ""Lache"" offers a useful entry point into <i>Order of Noise</i> as a whole, highlighting how adept Gainsborough is at subtly warping his vision in unexpected ways. It's the type of approach that can easily end up unfocused, with separate strands set in motion that end up dangling in the ether. But tiny motifs emerge that tie everything together. The processed sighs that pockmark ""Silten"" give it a sluggish feel, something that loops around again later in the barren slo-mo grind of ""Villaine"". And Gainsborough is fond of stretched-out mood pieces. ""2 Moon Dub"" is the embodiment of that malaise at finding a club winding down for the night after endlessly plodding through puddled streets under the promise of something better. ""Aries"" goes even further, dredging up feelings of desperate 4 a.m. glances between strangers across a rapidly emptying bar.</p>
<p>There's no overall sense of narrative to <i>Order of Noise</i>, but the depth of the production leaves itself open to interpretation. Dig past the early <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a> stylings of ""Scarletta"", and there's an intriguing mesh of industrial noise and balmy ambience. Some of those tweaks occasionally bear an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex</a>-like fondness for tinkering. On ""Plane Curves"" it initially sounds like Gainsborough has mixed a percussion loop far too high in the mix, only for it to become a wonderfully cantankerous center on multiple plays. That desire to bring agitation into an unexpected realm is a particularly Bristolian trait, whether it's in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4130-mark-stewart/"">Mark Stewart</a>'s aggro-funk workouts or through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a> adding an unanticipated analog bite to their sound circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11438-third/""><i>Third</i></a>. <i>Order of Noise</i> subtly pulls on similar feelings of antagonism, in the process splitting open some welcome cracks in a well-traveled path.</p></div>"|17286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17286-order-of-noise/|7.0|Nick Neyland

On DeMarco's other 2012 record, the EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16476-rock-and-roll-night-club/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rock and Roll Night Club</i></a>, he tinkered with yacht rock, AM radio gold, and Bowie-like glam. The mixture injected an unsettling sleaziness into a funny, occasionally creepy collection of songs that walked the line between irony and sincerity.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In contrast, <i>2 </i>goes right for the gut. DeMarco writes about life-- both the heavy moments and the mundane ones-- with economy and newfound grace. He's still not entirely upfront, but he has a knack for building songs where the realness of his subject matter lies just below the surface. In a Pitchfork <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/8956-mac-demarco/"" target=""_blank"">guest list</a> from earlier in October, DeMarco cites Jonathan Richman as a role model, mostly because he felt that Richman had ""a very enjoyable time his whole life."" Richman is an expert at writing entire worlds into his songs, an approach that DeMarco nails on <i>2</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Opening track ""Cooking Up Something Good"" is a strong example of his approach. A loose instrumental vamp slides into a greasy guitar line, as his laconic, sleepy voice delivers subtly heartbreaking observations. ""Mommy's in the kitchen, cooking up something good/ And daddy's on the sofa, pride of the neighborhood"". When the chorus comes in (""Oh, when life moves this slowly/ Oh, just try and let it go""), it's blindsiding, and his sense of defeat is palpable.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As the song progresses it becomes clear that what initially felt like an ode to the frustrating teenage days of struggling against your suburban surroundings is actually about a father figure manufacturing drugs in the basement. ""Cooking Up Something Good"" is about boredom and sadness and our skewed perception of time, but it's also about family secrets and how we construct emotional escape hatches to get away from the inescapable realities of blood ties. This careful world-building continues across the entire album, sometimes with a lighter touch. DeMarco's thinly veiled honesty shows up prominently on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14383-ode-to-viceroy/"" target=""_blank"">""Ode to Viceroy""</a> where, over an unsettling guitar flange that fizzles into a flat shimmer, he sings about how much he loves smoking cigarettes. His voice skirts the edge of disinterest, but never quite gets there. </p>
<p class=""p1"">After spending time with <i>2</i>, DeMarco's vocal deadpan starts to sound weary and wise. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13947-my-kind-of-woman/"" target=""_blank"">""My Kind of Woman""</a>, he effectively makes a prom love song that will never get played at any actual prom-- it oozes beautifully simple and direct sentiment: ""You're my kind of woman/ And I'm down on my hands and knees begging you please, baby, show me your world."" That last line, ""show me your world,"" returns to the concept that DeMarco and the people he sings about are all living, breathing entities, not blank slates to project emotion on. When they're gone from DeMarco's life, they still exist. It doesn't really get more honest than that.</p></div>"|17182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17182-mac-demarco-2/|8.2|Sam Hockley-Smith

On the one hand, they can try to please their core fanbase by sticking to their established sound. The downside of this approach is that it may stunt their ability to grab a larger audience. (It also leaves them open to accusations of asking fans to pay for a record that is basically a well-mastered mixtape.) The other option is to go full pop and embrace the new collaborators and sounds that a big budget has to offer, a path associated with disrespected sellouts (B.o.B.), MCs mired in self-loathing (Lupe Fiasco), and rappers that tried to go pop and failed anyway (Wale's first act).</p>
<p>There are exceptions. Artists like Drake and J. Cole have made better, more accessible versions of the early songs that first got them buzz, and Nicki Minaj plays both sides of the field. Waka Flocka Flame was smart enough to capitalize on his timing simply by turning a proposed mixtape into a debut album, and, most recently, Kendrick Lamar used his unwavering artistic vision to essentially subvert this game entirely. But this is still a thin line for artists to walk, one so difficult that good-to-great major label rap debuts now feel like a minor miracle.</p>
<p>So maybe <i>Dreams and Nightmares </i>is something to celebrate, even though it's imperfect. After navigating that push-pull, <a href=""http://www.meekmilldreamteam.com/splash/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Meek Mill</a> has emerged with an album that is distinct in both voice and sound and also plays to his strengths. It is tense and dramatic, with variations of piano constituting the bedrock of the album and Meek rapping passionately even by his own standards.</p>
<p>His music channels pain, anger, empathy, and glee into a wave that hits immediately and forcefully, especially on the album's first two songs. On the opening title track, he raps unabated for nearly four minutes, tracing lines from his come-up in Philly to strip clubs in Miami and back, over a beat that morphs into menace halfway through. It's a track that best distills Meek's singularity; hurt oozes from his voice and words, illustrating rap's literal and spiritual roots.</p>
<p>Rap is often about contradiction, of wanting to stay humble and true while still stunting. Sneering talking heads and confused elitists use that struggle as a weapon against the music: How can this music, and these artists, be taken seriously when they brag about throwing money at strippers? The genius of Meek's music is that he embodies, fleshes out, and answers the rapper's dilemma.</p>
<p>Struggle and triumph, are palpable and plainly articulated in his music, and it makes the best of <i>Dreams and Nightmares </i>(including ""In God We Trust"" and ""Believe It"")<i> </i>feel eminently vital. He is as much a truth-teller as lyricist, and this singular viewpoint and delivery have both been carried over from his mixtapes. It extends to ""Traumatized"", a track where Meek addresses his father's killer while illustrating exactly how treacherous his upbringing was for him and those around him. Where some rappers coast, Meek's mere existence feels earned.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the album loses steam with a quarter of the way to go. ""Tony Story Pt. 2"" is the follow-up to the stunning storytelling track from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15977-dreamchasers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dreamchasers</i></a>, but this version lacks its precision and is bogged down by a chintzy Boi-1da beat. ""Who You're Around"", featuring Mary J. Blige, marks the point where the album becomes syrupy and maudlin. Some songs that appear earlier on the album (""Maybach Curtains"", ""Young Kings"") borrow the orchestral bloat of Rick Ross, and could've been replaced by up-tempo bangers à la ""House Party"" or ""Burn"" on which Meek has made his name. </p>
<p>Still, Meek has made the move from mixtapes to the majors with a solid vision. Whether he can maintain or strengthen that in the future is an open question, but this is music that immediately hits emotionally and physically while lingering in your thoughts long after you turn it off. <i>Dreams and Nightmares</i> is the type of thing rap will always need, even when it's in flawed form<i>.</i></p></div>"|17315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17315-dreams-and-nightmares/|7.4|Jordan Sargent

This development is neither sudden nor surprising-- the swapping of sleek sounds and tidy quantization for more distressed sonic textures and complicated time signatures has been a throughline of pretty much all electronic music for the past three or four years. But it's a difficult enviornment for someone with as crisp an aesthetic as <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/artists/michael_mayer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael Mayer</a>.</p>
<p>Mayer may be among the more celebrated of the last decade's dance personalities, but he doesn't slot quite so easily into this current landscape. That's partly because the louche, tasteful, and continental sensibilities that defined his best work don't seem like dominant ideologies in dance music anymore. Perhaps correspondingly, it also feels like his ambition and energy have waned. Over the last few years, Mayer's label Kompakt has settled into a comfortable but unremarkable groove, working roughly the same corners of the same circuit for what seem like ever-diminishing returns. Meanwhile, Mayer's solo work has been so sporadic and incremental that his Discogs page might as well be covered in moss.</p>
<p><i>Mantasy</i> is Mayer's first original full-length in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11781-touch-speicher-2/"" target=""_blank"">eight years</a>. Considering such a lengthy absence, you'd be forgiven for wondering if he might come back with something dramatically different, but he doesn't take any big swings here, nor does he seem to worry much about stretching beyond his own aesthetic bounds. Detractors will argue that in 2012 his kind of touch sounds more middle-aged than craftsmanlike, and, frankly, they'll be right. In that way, I suppose Mayer is kind of a litmus test for modern dance music listeners: So long as the idea of ""middle-aged"" isn't total anathema to you, you'll find something to like here.</p>
<p>Even though it operates under the familiar laws of Mayer's universe, <i>Mantasy</i>'s appeal largely comes from how self-contained and individual each cut is; whether it's a fidgety horror show theme (""Lamusetwa""), a moody nod to Jan Hammer (""Mantasy""), a bouquet of harp trills and birdsong (""Baumhaus""), or a skronky jazz workout (""Rudi Was a Punk""), each of these 10 tracks aims at a distinct and concrete idea. Which isn't to say that all of them hit.</p>
<p>As with the tepid rhythm exercise ""Neue Furche"" and the aforementioned ""Lamusetwa"", Mayer's tendency to dial things like promisingly outre sounds or rhythm sections requiring muscle toward tastefulness instead of coarseness means that he has a frustrating default tendency toward the middle of the road. On other tracks, though, such as the perfectly pitched ""Rudi"" or the ""Billie Jean""-aping highlight ""Wrong Lap"", which manages the neat trick of containing some pretty nuanced sounds while also sounding huge, you're reminded of how the right amount of restraint in the right places can still lead to unexpected magic.</p></div>"|17254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17254-mantasy/|7.0|Mark Pytlik

To expect a band in their mid teens-- as in the case of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/egyptianhiphop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Egyptian Hip Hop</a> a few years ago-- to have the answer to much bigger questions about their future direction was always going to be somewhat unreasonable. Nonetheless, the initial buzz around the band here in the UK was fevered, and with their weird, colorful hair and strange name, the Manchester band certainly looked the part in early magazine coverage.</p>
<p>The band's debut full-length, <i>Good</i><i> Don't Sleep</i>, appears after two years of lying low following their first tentative step-- an EP called <i>Some Reptiles Developed Wings</i>, made while they were between the age of 16 and 17. That short collection was produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"">Hudson Mohawke</a>, whose trademark maximal touch helped bring them out of themselves. At the time the band played the sullen teenager routine to a T: skulking around on stage, not bothering too much about chores like interviews with national press. Their influences matched this outlook too, and despite HudMo's sparkly sonics, the EP ultimately felt too bogged down by a debt to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">the Cure</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4964-klaxons/"" target=""_blank"">Klaxons</a>. Still, that time with Mohawke, plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORbaasWeLCw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">previous work</a> with members of Late of the Pier, and most recently, electronic label <a href=""http://www.randsrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R&amp;S</a>, seems to have stood them in good stead. Most impressively on <i>Good Don't Sleep</i>, Egyptian Hip Hop find a sonic world of their own.</p>
<p>A song like ""Snake Lane West"" feels furthest removed from the dance-punk lite that they made at first. Rubbery bass and off-kilter guitar twist around each other, creating a sinister backdrop for Alex Hewett's barely-there vocals. Hewett intensifies the dread much as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"" target=""_blank"">Liars</a>' Angus Andrew would, singing clashing notes and teasing out melodic contrasts that feel as striking as they are strange. ""One Eyed King"" plays in similar murk too, unafraid of letting an ugly sound sit for just a little too long. Here, though, the grime morphs into something undeniably pretty and engaging, with unexpected flashes of Nirvana at their most stoned, or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjhEW8FgdA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>White Pony</i>-era Deftones</a> minus the distortion.</p>
<p>There are a few more straightforward songs to be found here. Opener ""Tobago"" is gorgeous in its own way; looping guitar pattens rub against plenty of open air and static bass, while Hewett's voice anchors the movement, tightly harmonizing in the chorus for one of the record's prettiest moments. Singles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14035-syh/"" target=""_blank"">""SYH""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14258-yoro-diallo/"" target=""_blank"">""Yoro Diallo""</a> carry more urgency, the latter sounding like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5720-foals/"" target=""_blank"">Foals</a> bent slightly out of shape. Again, well-knitted vocal harmonies help the song feel easier to love on first listen, without compromising on the screwed sonics they mine so effectively elsewhere. </p>
<p>Occasionally, though, <i>Good Don't Sleep</i> drifts <i>too</i> far in the wrong direction and coasts too much on vibe. And if there's one thing Egyptian Hip Hop aren't yet, it's good editors. But what the record lacks in brevity and nous it just about makes up for in the thrill of not quite knowing where Egyptian Hip Hop are leading you. <i>Good Don't Sleep</i> finds them holding a mirror up to their early work, eager to reverse any youthful misstep. Where Hewett once impersonated an interesting voice (namely that of Robert Smith) he now sounds older and more confident. Their early, punky tunes carried flourishes of post-DFA dance music, whereas the songs here are now imbued with modern electronic music's more liquid, experimental spirit. Egyptian Hip Hop now sound like the band they dressed up so well as at first: weird, otherworldly, and exciting.</p></div>"|17225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17225-good-dont-sleep/|7.5|Hari Ashurst

Are we to take it as a sign of commitment to the project, especially in light of the two-plus years that have passed since Wavves' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14415-king-of-the-beach/"" target=""_blank""><i>King of the Beach</i></a>? Or is it an indication that the Williams brothers can just crank this stuff out like it's nothing? As an actual piece of music, <i>Eternal Champ </i>mostly just reminds you that Nathan's proven to have a quick learning curve. While it doesn't parallel the leap he made from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12783-wavvves/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wavvves </i></a>to <i>King of the Beach </i>(or even <i>Wavves </i>to <i>Wavvves</i> for that matter), it's a more impressive, diverse, and genuinely artistic endeavor than its enjoyable but slight predecessor.</p>
<p><i>Eternal Champ</i> feels more like a proper full-length, where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17000-stay-calm/"" target=""_blank""><i>Stay Calm</i></a> was presented as a incomplete-by-definition ""beat tape."" In addition to a generally darker tone, this album just sounds <i>heavier. </i>It delves into slower tempos and chillier textures, and the segues feel as important as the tracks proper. </p>
<p>Sweet Valley may not be particularly original but they do show a knack for knowing when to mix styles and when to collate: Lead-off ""One"" has impressive range, morphing from the more stoned iterations of late-90s southern hip-hop to Three 6 Mafia's fight music. It bleeds right into ""Where Will I Go"", which throws in Lex Luger's trademark lightcycle windup before drifting off into the tropics. From there on out, the Williams brothers set their sights on clear targets and hit the mark. Their style doesn't stray far from the blazer's choice of hip-hop producers-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> (""Stone""), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">Dilla</a> (""Bros Beyond"", ""Sentimental Trash""), recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30578-the-alchemist/"" target=""_blank"">Alchemist</a>. The vocal sample on ""Motorcycle Renegade"" is similar enough to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a> and Party Supplies' ""Thug Love Story 2012"", to suggest that <i>Eternal Champ</i> was probably only a few months in the making, but the adaptability is admirable.</p>
<p>While <i>Eternal Champ </i>is smartly constructed, always enjoyable, and never hits an errant beat, it's worth asking what exactly the endgame is for Sweet Valley. Do they want to do more than soundtrack skate videos? Granted, even if they never release another note of music, they've exceeded the expectations one might have for a beatmaking side project from Wavves. But what's lacking here is a sense of stakes-- the ""millennial who smokes weed and plays video games"" thing isn't exactly underrepresented right now. But Williams is the guy who used ""I'm just having fun with you"" as a mission statement, so it's probably not a pressing concern. Sweet Valley feels like the Williams brothers using their free time to soundtrack yours.</p></div>"|17334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17334-eternal-champ/|6.6|Ian Cohen

No matter how big the stage, Neil Young, Billy Talbot, and Frank ""Poncho"" Sampedro will inevitably find themselves tightly packed in front of Ralph Molina's drums, bobbing and flailing in such close proximity that it's a miracle they never crack guitar necks. It's an aggressively insular move for a band playing to thousands, an unambiguous signal that the feedback storm they are conjuring is often more about them than us.</p>
<p>That self indulgence is the beating heart of each time Young deigns to bring the Horse back out of the barn, even as the decision excites his fanbase like no other. To the point, the latest Crazy Horse reunion was announced with the leak of <a href=""http://www.neilyoung.com/crazyhorsevideo.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an instrumental jam</a> on the chords to ""Fuckin' Up"" and ""Cortez the Killer” that ran over 37 minutes. Then there was the first official leg of the comeback: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16684-americana/"" target=""_blank""><i>Americana</i></a>, where Young fed old-as-dirt traditionals such as ""She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain"" into the Crazy Horse engine, followed by an arena tour that filled nearly half the setlist with unreleased material.</p>
<p>But <i>Psychedelic Pill</i> might be the most accurate studio portrayal of The Huddle yet. Three songs gallop past the 15-minute mark, and the opener ""Driftin' Back"" approaches a half hour, quickly weeding out the faint of heart. They are the three longest songs ever released by Young (if you don't count <i>Arc</i>) and they feel like it. ""Driftin' Back"", in particular, is nearly trance-inducing as it locks onto the same chord progression, interrupted only occasionally by mini-rants about hip-hop haircuts and mp3 sound quality.</p>
<p>Yet other than these marathon challenges, playing with Crazy Horse is playing it safe for Young: You know exactly what you're going to get, and there are none of the pleasant surprises of 2010's excellent loop-dabbling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14684-le-noise/"" target=""_blank""><i>Le Noise</i></a>. One song, ""She's Always Dancing"", even sounds like the band just took an instrumental rehearsal of ""Like a Hurricane"" and added a new vocal track over the top-- which is good enough to make it the second best jam on the record. ""Ramada Inn"" is paint-by-numbers Crazy Horse, indistinguishable from any of their late-period outings beyond its refusal to end.</p>
<p>It will also surprise no Neil Young fan that most of the songs here are about aging, continuing a roughly 50-year streak of obsessing over getting old. So much of <i>Psychedelic Pill</i> is Young looking back, from the long-married couple of ""Ramada Inn"" to the classic rock name-dropping of ""Twisted Road"". He even reminisces his way back to the cradle, with ""Born in Ontario"", a brief country-rocker that's a welcome breath-catcher, even though it bears a giant hole in the shape of deceased longtime collaborator and auxiliary Horseman Ben Keith's slide guitar.</p>
<p>But Neil's particular flavor of nostalgia has always been a little on the sour side. When he references the Woodstock Generation, he tends to do it with a scowl, angry about the failure of the hippie dream even as he still clings to its promise. <i>Psychedelic Pill</i> suggests a softening of that harsh stance, particularly on the saccharine ""Twisted Road"" with its irony-free shout-outs to Dylan and the Dead and the distracting ""trippy"" effects that ruin the title track.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the album's final epic, ""Walk Like a Giant"", scrawls a jagged line through that cuddly history with a single chord change, coming immediately after an immensely dopey verse about how Neil and his friends were gonna save the world. In fact, ""Walk Like a Giant"", is easily the best studio Crazy Horse performance since <i>Ragged Glory</i>. Once again, the formula is unchanged-- it even swipes pretty heavily from the ""Hey Hey My My"" riff-- but between the verses the Horse is whipped until it foams at the mouth. Everything great about Neil Young, electric guitarist, is on full display, his singular tone veering from feral growls and feedback to blistering fury while the other three egg him on with subtle, perennially underrated counterpoint.</p>
<p>Despite the patience required to get there, the track underlines the greatest trick of Neil Young's long career: that his most self-indulgent mode can also be his most crowd-pleasing. At this point, the ""these old guys still know how to rock!"" angle for Crazy Horse is itself old enough to collect Social Security. But there's enough life and fuck-you attitude left in <i>Psychedelic Pill</i> to remind a listener that ""it's better to burn out than to fade away"" wasn't necessarily about dying young, so long as you avoided phoning it in. If circling the wagons is what it takes to keep Neil Young's fire raging, then just be happy he lets us pay to watch.</p></div>"|17213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17213-psychedelic-pill/|7.0|Rob Mitchum

Following the trajectory of Main Attrakionz's career, which has produced a multitude of free solo and collaborative mixtapes hinged on celestial samples and irreverent rhymes, it's not a terribly surprising statement. Wedged somewhere between Bay Area peer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"" target=""_blank"">Lil B</a>'s prolific and ever-expanding thought balloons and the spacey introversion of chillwave, ""cloud rap"" was viewed as the antithesis of party rap, a music that made little sense outside of a weed-fogged, wi-fi enabled bubble built for one.</p>
<p>This was a big part of cloud rap's appeal, but any music built on the fickle whims of the web is vulnerable. But on releases like their 2011 breakthrough <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15784-main-attrakionz-808s-dark-grapes-ii/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">808s &amp; Dark Grapes II</a></i> and Squadda B's <i>I Smoke Because I Don't Care About Death</i>, Main Attrakionz proved to be relatable and able to adapt to new sounds. Here on their proper full-length debut, a sound in danger of stagnation has been brightened and reconfigured in appealing ways.</p>
<p>While it's as smoked-out, hedonistic, and vaguely introspective as their previous efforts, <i>Bossalinis &amp; Fooliyones</i> at times sounds downright bombastic thanks to its embrace of earthly influences. Taking it to the club might be taking it a little too far, but the springy opener ""Green on Sight"" and the addictive ""La Piñata"" bring to mind house parties, parking lots, and late-night convertible joyrides. Squadda and Mondre put a lot of work into getting their unconventional sound noticed, and it's obvious as to why they would want to hold onto their outsider status. But it's hard for them to mask just how much fun they're having, and the feeling is infectious.</p>
<p>Main Attrakionz have never been great rappers, and sometimes that's a problem: ""I can't complain I'm doin' my thing, I mean I'm in my lane/ I can't complain I'm steady getting' paid, I'm sippin' the drank,"" seems to be the motto. But thanks to a crack team of mostly unknown producers, the recurring themes of money, smoke, girls, and hustle are cast in a flattering light. Despite there being 13 producers spread over 17 tracks (Chicago space cadets <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30494-supreme-cuts/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Supreme Cuts</a> and the ubiquitous <a href=""http://www.harryfraud.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harry Fraud</a> get two at-bats), <i>Bossalinis &amp; Fooliyones</i> sounds sonically cohesive and consistent. The duo's laconic flows feel tailor-made for off-the-cuff game spitting, and tracks like highlight ""Cloud Life"" get a boost from producer Joe Wax's amorous slow-burn. ""LFK"" (which stands for ""Lo-fi Kings"") finds the two riffing on UGK and providing their own take on all things Houston. And Fraud, as if trying to provide a minimalist companion piece to current hit <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEw3IxKym7o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Function""</a>, helps assist the hometown anthem single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48076-watch-main-attrakionz-go-out-to-sea-in-the-video-for-do-it-for-the-bay-ft-davinci/"" target=""_blank"">""Do It For the Bay""</a>.</p>
<p>Too bad that what follows marks a significant drop-off in quality. The problems start with ""Superstitious"", which features a usually reliable <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaytoven"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zaytoven</a> on auto-pilot and a phoned-in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a> verse. Tracks like ""Love Is Life"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14406-cloud-body/"" target=""_blank"">""Cloud Body""</a> are boilerplate cloud rap, feeling lifeless against the harder-hitting material. Other songs simply suffer from being too corny (the melodramatic ""Wings""), or too leaden (""Bury Me a Millionaire"", which features name-drop puns that even Game wouldn't go near). The real problem might just be that, having been so mixtape-oriented for so long, Main Attrakionz haven't developed the necessary editing skills. By the time you get to ""Wings"", you still have 20 minutes left in a nearly 70 minute album.</p>
<p>Still, there's something obviously charming about Main Attrakionz. They're transparent and often entertainingly aloof-- in the same <i>FACT</i> interview, Mondre admitted to not even knowing what chillwave was. So <i>Bossalinis &amp; Fooliyones</i> is a testament to honesty and effort. Here are two guys who clearly love to rap and work hard at it, taking a style they can call their own, and presenting it in a more user-friendly way. More often than not, they make it work.</p></div>"|17215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17215-bossalinis-fooliyones/|7.1|Zach Kelly

Thomas is again a passive adventurer on his second solo album, <i>Prins Thomas II</i>, on which he continues to explore foggy krautrock, hippie jazz, and space disco.</p>
<p><i>Prins Thomas II</i> jettisons his debut album's guitar-aided motorik expeditions in favor of slow, worming dance grooves. This was intentional: Thomas abandoned the live drums and bass that powered his first collection in favor of drum machines and synthesizers. It's a curious choice-- the world does not lack for slow-disco synth enthusiasts-- and as a result <i>II</i> is more diffuse than its predecessor and contains less gnarly, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8798-michael-rother/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Rother</a>-inspired grit. Thomas excelled for years as an edits guru, so he has to know that <i>II</i> is too slow and linear for dancing; it's more likely to make you tap your foot and unconsciously nod your head.</p>
<p>Thomas' compositions don't build so much as perpetually unwind; when he adds a bassline or twirls a new melody, it doesn't reach toward an apex so much as remind us that, yes, we are still strolling downhill toward an undefined moment of rest. This is Thomas' neatest trick as a producer but it's also the undoing of <i>Prins Thomas II</i>, which provides little to rally around or grasp onto. In <a href=""http://www.rbmaradio.com/shows/prins-thomas-fireside-chat"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview with Red Bull Music Academy</a>, he admits that he's never had an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16173-its-the-arps/"" target=""_blank"">""Inspector Norse""</a>-type hit, which... yeah. Thomas specializes in this type of lay-in-the-cut disco but it would be nice to see him reach for the brass ring occasionally.</p>
<p>The 13-minute ""Bobletekno"" is the album's centerpiece-- we know because Thomas reprises its tittering, aluminum-foil drums later on as ""Bobletekno (Permiks)""-- and an example of Thomas using drum machines to add detail to his bold melodies. They are an aggressive, echoing patter throughout; when he reprises the song, he presents the rhythm sans accompaniment. He offers a similar trick on the sparse ""Bom Bom"", which presents a standard Thomas rhythm in repose, highlighting the subtle congo thwacks. These tracks, which play like a photo-negative version of the rest of the album, present a possible path forward for Thomas, space disco without the disco. (In the Red Bull chat, Thomas is touchy about the term ""space disco,"" but it's unavoidable until he offers tracks that avoid it.)</p>
<p>Slight stylistic shifts aside, <i>II</i> leaves Thomas in much the same place his debut did: as a producer predisposed to coloring inside the lines. We're left with some pretty pictures for our refrigerators and some worthwhile domestic jams, but little to be excited about.</p></div>"|17203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17203-ii/|6.3|Andrew Gaerig

As a sultry, self-conscious slab of smooth, Memphis-style soul, the song itself doesn't quite feel ""next,"" but that's not the point. Its power comes from its source: ChesnuTT's got experience on the other side of the equation. In 2002, as the internet and web were ready to redefine DIY promotion, ChesnuTT was working his humbly titled 36-track debut <i>The Headphone Masterpiece</i> any way he could, to anyone he could find. He slipped it into stereos at random L.A. parties, and gave his number to equally random people at malls, inviting them to come back to his place for listening sessions. He'd been kicking around the scene for a while (long enough to get <a href=""http://youtu.be/YS4YZ7GLe9c?t=1m43s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pulled onstage to pose at a 2002 Strokes gig</a> in L.A.), and the demo soon wound up in ?uestlove's hands. When <i>Masterpiece </i>highlight ""The Seed"" was remade into <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojC0mg2hJCc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the best song</a> on the Roots' LP <i>Phrenology, </i>ChesnuTT and his album were instantly all kinds of ""cool"" and ""next.""</p>
<p><i>Masterpiece </i>slotted perfectly into ""neo soul"" endcaps, and music nerds rushed to crown the album <i>Sign O' the Times</i> on <i>Alien Lanes</i>' budget. ChesnuTT was courted by major labels, copped a four-star <i>Rolling Stone </i>review that called him ""a new breed of American troubadour,"" and was featured in the <i>Guardian</i> as part of a piece that (bizarrely) suggested he was the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2003/dec/12/popandrock1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""new Hendrix.""</a> Until the release of <i>Landing on a Hundred</i>, <i>Masterpiece</i>'s legacy was further defined as the sole release from the guy who subsequently disappeared, save a brief appearance in Dave Chappelle's <i><a href=""http://www.metacafe.com/watch/an-efjgbJJJthbYu/block_party_2005_cody_chesnutt/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Block Party</a> </i>and a quietly issued <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Skin_No_Value"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2010 EP</a>. In this regard, it's not just ChesnuTT's beautiful falsetto and lightly-scuffed tenor that recall Terence Trent D'Arby-- both were unconventional R&amp;B prodigies with no shortage of swagger, who managed to drop off the pop map soon after their highly-praised debuts. According to ChesnuTT, his disappearance was planned: to start a family far away from music's exhausting business end. <i>Landing </i>is an apt reflection of an artist restarting after several years, but without sacrificing the eccentricity that initially made him such a compelling figure.</p>
<p>Recorded in part with a 10-piece band in the same studio where Al Green cut ""Let's Stay Together"", <i>Landing </i>largely situates itself in the early-1970s soul tradition of Green and Curtis Mayfield-- no matter how personal or political, the music is never too far from the pulpit. Opening cut ""'Till I Met Thee"" is positively beatific, ChesnuTT's scratched-out funk guitar alternating with a rich brass backdrop that lends the refrain an earthy gospel overtone. ""Under the Spell of the Handout"" is a dizzying trip through conflicting impulses that never tips over into the finger-wagging implied by the title. ChesnuTT's at his best when he can let his own contradictory spirit move him-- that's what <i>Headphone Masterpiece</i> did, in bulk-- and on ""Handout"" he begs to be let in ""the caste"" one second, and asks ""what am I feeding on"" the next. <i>Hundred </i>is occasionally wayward, but you can't expect ChesnuTT, even as a father of two in his mid-40s, to ever play it straight.</p>
<p>The eccentricities of <i>Hundred</i> are milder than <i>Masterpiece</i>, but they give the album much of its vitality. On ""I've Been Life"", he channels Muhammad Ali (""Since my birth/ I've been the greatest attraction on the earth"") while shouting out an alphabetical roll-call of each African nation. The result sounds designed to slot between the Crusaders and James Brown in the <a href=""http://www.sonyclassics.com/soulpower/site.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Zaire '74"" music festival</a> accompanying the Ali/Foreman ""Rumble in the Jungle."" On the peppy late album cut ""Don't Wanna Go the Other Way"", he rides a galloping bassline until it breaks, incorporating puffs of breath as a primary rhythmic component. Lyrically, he seems to be talking to the younger Cody (""Oh, frustrated young man/ Still carrying that load"") while actively pushing himself to remain on a righteous path dotted with temptation. It's good advice: all the better because he seems to be heeding it.</p></div>"|17270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17270-landing-on-a-hundred/|6.9|Eric Harvey

And so it goes for 19-year-old college student and occasional surfer Yoodoo Park, who first started recording short, melancholic guitar-pop songs as <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/GRMLN/101201576638548"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GRMLN</a> two years ago for his own enjoyment while cruising around in his car. GRMLN's debut EP, <i>Explore</i>, collects seven of those tracks, which flit in and out over the course of 15 breezy minutes. It's a solid but slight record made by an artist who could produce something more substantial should he discover grander ambitions. </p>
<p>Based on Park's preference for pointillist guitars and subtly driving surf-rock rhythms, it might have been easier for him just to play Real Estate or Beach Fossils CDs in his car, rather than make his own variation on the dreamy, nostalgic music those groups have come to personify. <i>Explore</i>'s first single, ""Coral"", certainly doesn't break any new ground in the sad guy/sunny melody school of songwriting. For two minutes a circular guitar riff and stiffly syncopated drum beat set the tone for Park's moony deference for the ocean and the big, bright sun setting over it. ""It's all right,"" he sings in the chorus, which is about as decipherable as he gets on <i>Explore. </i>Park sings in a soft voice somewhere between a murmur and a sigh, preferring to let jangly six-strings and ping-pong basslines articulate the emotional core of his songs.</p>
<p>While the guitars immediately jump out of the otherwise spare and direct songs on <i>Explore</i>, it's the brittle yet surprisingly nimble rhythm section that ultimately sticks. The drum part on ""Depressions"" is little more than a lightly tapped snare, but as the song settles into a hypnotic, relatively extended groove that pushes to nearly three minutes, Park exhibits a proclivity for quietly unfolding soundscapes that could really beguile if he ever gets a bigger recording budget. Conversely, the stripped down ""Live.Think.Die"" never really goes anywhere, as Park trills pleasantly over his unaccompanied guitar for a few minutes before suddenly stopping.</p>
<p><i>Explore </i>suggests that while Park can produce listenable songs that do right by their influences, he's still an inexperienced talent in the process of finding his own voice. The album-closing ""Patio"" sounds weirdly like a left-coast Bon Iver, with its ethereal acoustic strumming and falsetto vocal. It's a derivative curveball that pushes <i>Explore </i>in a more generic direction. Park is better off building on the emotional quality of his recent cover of Ben E. King's ""Stand By Me"". Like the most affecting parts of <i>Explore</i>, Park's ""Stand By Me"" is old fashioned, predictable, and probably shouldn't work as well as it does. But Park's guileless open-heartedness is naive in the best possible sense. If he can combine that feeling with more sophisticated songwriting, he might have something.</p></div>"|17338.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17338-explore/|6.5|Steven Hyden

The Manchester producer spent a good part of the last decade turning out solid tracks under his own name and under the alias Andrea. Though he always returned to dub techno, he flirted with a range of genres, from juke to house to dubstep, and some of his music was very good. But Stott never quite zeroed in on a unique voice. That changed in 2011 with the release of two short albums, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15447-passed-me-by/""><i>Passed Me By</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15971-we-stay-together/""><i>We Stay Together</i></a>. Stott left behind the quicker tempos of dance proper, and slowing down allowed him to sink deeper into his music, where he found a new world of atmosphere and texture. <i>Passed</i> and <i>Stay</i> were <i>heavy</i> records that highlighted something new about the expressive power of bass. Dub techno, stretching back to its origins with the early-1990s Berlin project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19435-basic-channel/"">Basic Channel</a>, tends to view the low end as a mysterious black sludge. Where bass in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a>-style EDM is a precision weapon, with drops punctuating the tracks and jacking up the mood in an instant, the bottom octave in dub techno is more of an enveloping presence. It's murkier, more oppressive, colder, something you wade through and push against. Which is why the inertia of the relentless 4/4 beat signifies energy whatever the tempo. </p>
<p>On his two 2011 releases, Stott found an unusual musicality in deep, foreboding bass. His music throbbed with the sooty remnants of industry and had obvious appeal for those interested in dark ambiance of any stripe; its all-consuming nature gave him a new audience beyond the realm of dance music. With his new album, <i>Luxury Problems</i>, he adds a few more wrinkles, and his music has become simultaneously more complex and more accessible. Working with operatically trained vocalist Alison Skidmore (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8973-andy-stott/"">Stott met her</a> as a student when she taught him piano), he's humanized his sound, made it more beautiful and richer on the surface while further accentuating its dark heart. The new dynamic leads to another big leap forward for the producer.</p>
<p>Skidmore's voice is a versatile instrument in its own right, but Stott's looping and processing gives it even more flexibility. Though <i>Luxury Problems</i> has a consistent overall mood, the feel and structure of the individual tracks vary quite a bit, and the pieces featuring Skidmore find her singing pulled into all kinds of interesting shapes. The album opens with her in her most glassy and ethereal, as repetitions of her singing a single word, ""touch,"" float through space like soap bubbles. The ""ch"" phoneme is looped and becomes the hi-hat on the track, and gradually the sounds assemble themselves into a ghosted version of a conventional dance rhythm. But when Stott's machine bass pulse enters just under halfway through, we realize we're in for a world of serious contrasts: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14306-numb/"" target=""_blank"">""Numb""</a> is delicate and gorgeous but has an undercurrent of menace, and the tension between these qualities is the record's essence.</p>
<p>If ""Numb"" is Skidmore at her most spectral, ""Hatch the Plan"" finds her sounding more grounded, almost in the mode of a singer-songwriter. The choral-like layering on ""Plan"" brings to mind School of Seven Bells and even Throwing Muses. But it's the longest track on the record and is purely instrumental-- mostly a deeply unsettling mix of bass churn and machine noises-- for its first two minutes. That it moves from pure soundscape to something close to a proper song is further evidence of Stott's confidence; none of these tracks feel like they have to be any one thing, they're always growing and changing and defying expectations.</p>
<p>""Lost and Found"" has a similarly melodic approach, unspooling in a Middle Eastern mode and bringing to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1030-dead-can-dance/"">Dead Can Dance</a> at their most subtle. We can hear Stott drawing lines between 4AD-style gothic new wave and dub techno, building bridges between sounds and ideas based on his understanding of the elements and moods that connect them. Elsewhere, on ""Expecting"", he goes further into abstraction, constructing an intensely dark and ominous atmosphere that bring to mind the ice-cold isolationist drone of <a href=""http://www.koener.de/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Köner</a>. The excavation of electronic music history takes a more unusual turn on ""Up the Box"", which plays with a snippet of what sounds like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the ""Amen"" break</a>. But the familiar splash of jungle snares and cymbals is transformed by Stott into something of his own own, as he mixes the tricky rhythms with his now undeniable bass signature, a groaning maw flecked with distortion that feels like it's rattling everything within earshot. Stott has a rare ability to pull sounds from different places and fit them into his album conception.</p>
<p>Two records from the past offer antecedents for Stott's breakthrough: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2560-luomo/"">Luomo</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4929-vocalcity/""><i>Vocalcity</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10877-untrue/""><i>Untrue</i></a>. It's not that <i>Luxury Problems</i> sounds like either of these releases-- the mood and textures are vastly different in each case. But there's a spiritual connection between the three, all of which found producers working within the confines of a specific genre of electronic music discovering a way to turn their music inside and out and broaden its appeal through the manipulated voice. But if <i>Vocalcity</i> was a digital refraction of house music and <i>Untrue</i> took early UK dubstep as a jumping-off point to express post-club emptiness and yearning, <i>Luxury Problems</i> is more internally focused, an evocative and immersive soundtrack for a sustained look within. It's the headphones album of the year from a producer with a long history who has come into his own.</p></div>"|17205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/|8.7|Mark Richardson

It's got a nice ring to it, but might not be the best description of the veteran Oakland group's M.O. Sure, Neurosis' work has evolved over the course of a 27-year career-- from the gritty metallic punk of 1987's <i>Pain of Mind</i> to the harrowing post-hardcore prog of 1993's <i>Enemy of the Sun</i> and on to the majestic art doom of their current phase-- but the progression has been gradual, a series of seasonal shifts rather than fiery upheavals. That unhurried pace has helped make the band into a redwood of the underground, a model for Mastodon, Isis, and countless other crews of metal-oriented aesthetes. </p>
<p>So don't go into <i>Honor Found in Decay</i> expecting an abrupt left turn. The crushing, luminous, texturally resplendent suites here take their place alongside three Neurosis LPs' worth of similar material, from 2001's <i>A Sun That Never Sets</i> through 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10316-given-to-the-rising/"" target=""_blank""><i>Given to the Rising</i></a>. Like those releases, <i>Honor</i> draws as much on gothic folk and unstable, sample-accented ambience-- respective hallmarks of solo records by Von Till and fellow guitarist-vocalist Scott Kelly, and Neurosis' soundscape-focused alter ego, Tribes of Neurot-- as on the band's signature doomy catharsis. (<i>Honor</i> is also the fifth Neurosis album in a row recorded by Steve Albini, whose stripped-down aesthetic helps bring a sense of intimacy to the band's inherent grandeur.) At the same time, this latest effort is a highlight of the recent Neurosis discography. Despite brilliant moments on each, the previous three LPs at times seemed epic in length only; they didn't fully reward the endurance required to sit through them. The band remedies that on <i>Honor</i>. Like every Neurosis full-length of the past two decades, it's packed with long songs-- three out of seven clock in over 10 minutes-- but there's less slack here than before; for the most part, these are purposeful journeys. </p>
<p>It's telling that <i>Honor</i>'s two strongest tracks, opener ""We All Rage in Gold"" and closer ""Raise the Dawn"", are also the shortest. These pieces sum up how the record conveys an expansive feel while minimizing fuss. More importantly, they straight-up rock. After a quick mood-setting intro, ""We All Rage in Gold"" kicks into a badass midtempo groove-- the closest Neurosis has come to boogie-- with Kelly growling ruefully on top. The dynamics drop, but only briefly; soon, the full band roars back for one of its trademark sludgy climaxes, elevated by synth player Noah Landis's soaring violin simulations. ""Raise the Dawn"" is similarly gripping. A straightforward quiet-to-loud transition sets up <i>Honor</i>'s single most righteous moment: a swaggery sludge-blues refrain, over which Kelly sneers, ""All the rest have fallen on/ Returning the sun."" This shrewd curveball ends the record on a triumphant note. </p>
<p><i>Honor</i>'s longer tracks are hit-and-miss. ""At the Well""-- like ""Raise the Dawn"", a staple of the band's live sets since late 2010-- is a textbook Neurosis epic, formulaic but effective. The track stretches out from Von Till's dark-troubadour opening into elegiac doom, growing gradually more intense. When the drums drop out six minutes in, it's a dead giveaway for the torrential burst that follows; still, the shift is a stunner. Like seasoned horror directors, Neurosis know how to shake you up while abiding by convention. In contrast, ""Casting of the Ages"" lacks a narrative arc. Like the Neurosis equivalent of a power ballad, the track follows a straightforward whisper-then-roar format, simply trudging on until it ends. A song like this makes it easy to miss the more feral sound of <i>Enemy of the Sun</i> and 1992's <i>Souls at Zero</i>, records that privileged phantasmagoric sensory overload over tidy compositional logic.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the next track, ""All Is Found...In Time"", reestablishes tension. Here, the band sets aside brooding in favor of geeky psychedelic intrigue. Drummer Jason Roeder's tom-tom-heavy pummel leads the group through a cosmic-prog overture, which segues into a bluesy half-time heave; then Landis' Pink Floyd-style synths point the way to a kitschy yet ominous interlude. When the intro returns with a jolt, the ground seems to rush away, as though a shuttle simulator had malfunctioned, blasting the listener into deep space.</p>
<p>Moments like these help make <i>Honor Found in Decay</i> feel like a fresh start, even though the band's core palette hasn't changed. The record doesn't abandon the moody sprawl of the band's last few full-lengths, but it does help restore urgency to an aesthetic that seemed in danger of growing soporific. It's become common to refer to Neurosis as post-metal, as if the band had outgrown the primal allure of the riff. <i>Honor</i> refutes that idea. It's a record that proves these grizzled artisans still know how to flex their muscles.</p></div>"|17206.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17206-honor-found-in-decay/|7.9|Hank Shteamer

That misplaced apostrophe accidentally says an awful lot: Since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1602-the-fiery-furnaces/"" target=""_blank"">the Fiery Furnaces</a> released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13220-im-going-away/"" target=""_blank""><i>I'm Going Away</i></a> in 2009, their most accessible album to date, Matthew Friedberger hasn't exactly been on a charm offensive. He entered into a bizarre, one-sided, and intolerably lengthy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37167-fiery-furnaces-matt-friedberger-writes-virtual-response-to-beck-song/"" target=""_blank"">internet fight</a> with Thom Yorke and Beck, and between January 2011 and January 2012, released eight solo records, each performed on a single instrument in order to demonstrate the ""Cretan-Lacedaemonian principle,"" where ""every group of instruments is against every other group of instruments, every instrument is against every other instrument, and, finally, every instrument is against itself."" He appears to have invented the principle, and you'll struggle to find anyone who stuck around for all eight records. (This was while his sister, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8565-eleanor-friedberger/"" target=""_blank"">Eleanor</a>, released her gorgeous, underrated solo debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15623-last-summer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Last Summer</i></a>.) It's easy to interpret his behavior as a mission to whittle his fans' number down to single digits.</p>
<p>In an interview with <i>Under the Radar</i> magazine subtitled ""Breaking the Law of Diminishing Returns"" from October 2011, Friedberger, who now lives in Paris, opined that as older artists become more or less comfortable with writing to fit their songwriting character, their audience often becomes less comfortable with the fact. ""They don't say, 'They're so confident. They're really exploring what they're able to do. They're testing the boundaries.' Bullshit like that. They say the other bullshit like, 'They're self-indulgent. They're pretentious.'"" Acceptance or rejection; you get the impression he doesn't care for either. Somewhat pointlessly, I sometimes think about a game where you try to lose every Twitter follower you have, but without being actively hateful or idiotic; doing so in a calculated fashion to be as off-putting as possible. <i>Matricidal Sons of Bitches</i> would be very good at this game.</p>
<p>The concept here (though it really only exists on paper) is that <i>Matricidal Sons of Bitches</i> is a four-part opera about, you guessed it, mother-snuffing sons. The four parts are titled, ""LADIES-IN-WAITING--waiting forever"", ""BRAND-NEW-MOTHERS--trying it out"", ""EXPECTANT FATHERS--in for a surprise"", and ""DYING ON THE SIXTH SIDE"", and the atmosphere is suitably ominous. Opening song ""The Neighbors"" features a French woman describing (in English) the members of her family she has hated, none more so than her mother, a revelation backed by a huge thunderclap. There are drawings of bog-eyed men on the album's cover-- Peter, Charlie, Perry, Marco, Julian, and the baroque-haired Michael, presumably the sons-- on the back of which it says, ""Neither written nor produced nor directed by Matthew Friedberger."" It is immensely difficult to listen to start to finish. You know how people wear <i>Trout Mask Replica</i> as a badge of musical endurance? Van Vliet just got usurped.</p>
<p>What puts listeners in a difficult spot is that, no matter how infuriating it gets, <i>Matricidal Sons of Bitches</i> is clearly the product of serious compositional intention; it's not an accidental mess. Friedberger has a tremendous skill for creating snippets of what sound like old classics that never existed in the first place: ""But at the Door; Is it Him?"", ""The Next Morning"", ""As If in the Car With the Kids"", and ""Lying on the Sixth Side"" sound like theme tunes to family TV specials broadcast in Hawaii in the 1950s. ""Frustration by the Boulevards"" and ""Drifting Down the Alleys"" are so authentically like the soundtracks to wartime socials that they should have their own signature dance move. These pieces stutter and stop before their natural conclusions, making them feel like samples for the Avalanches to come in and repurpose, and they're full of beautifully warm, playful piano that seems made to soundtrack charming stop-motion mechanisms and families singing together. It's a kind of compact, cuckoo-clock portrait of togetherness. Which, given the record's murderous concept, was only made to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Friedberger's renderings of situations where dangerous scions lurk can be extremely evocative. ""Tell Me What it is You Want, Boys"" veers between sounding like an old blues 45 and someone sucking ghosts through the holes of a violin that's played many a cursed tune. (It also manages to sound like the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNRUjnp-5Rw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Peanuts"" music</a> played in ""Arrested Development"" when George Michael is particularly crestfallen.) The title track is a 42-second long, hypnotic meeting of abrasively bright synthesizer and watery harp blooms that feels like an invitation to dine with a sea beast in his cave, and, by the way, you're dessert.</p>
<p>There's a limited palette here that's perhaps meant as some kind of conclusion to the single-instrument records, which is interesting in theory, but too often seems like Friedberger filled a Casio keyboard with his own monstrous presets and jabbed away until some kind of song came out. Worst of all is when he picks the setting marked ""sounds from space."" ""Pursuit, Less Acute"" is a rasping attempt at Wagnerian intergalactic bombast that brings to mind a dying Darth Vader trying to hum his own once-menacing theme. As the record progresses, Friedberger continually and insistently deploys the sound of a dry, choked explosion, the kind used to convey the words ""error"" or ""do not pass"" or ""YOU HAVE FAILED START AGAIN"" on a video game.</p>
<p>Songs rarely end with any resolution; instead stopping dead and veering into the next turn unannounced. The fragmentation of the Books' loosely comparable <i>Music For a French Elevator</i> remained compact and coherent; Friedberger, on the other hand, thinks nothing of interrupting a flurry of lovely harp strums with an unbearable, high-pitched drone, only to return to the harp again seconds later. Combined with the record's main motif, repeated to a madness-inducing extent-- a piano clank surrounded by a gray drone that waxes and wanes to various degrees-- the constant feel of blocked paths and missed turns brings on the kind of stomachache that usually occurs when your GPS packs up in a maze of backwater lanes.</p>
<p>At this stage of his career, Matthew Friedberger comes across like the Andy Kaufman of indie rock, though these days he's less an outlier of the field than an errant baseball thwacked miles beyond its borders. Is he more interested in the process of challenging people's expectations or sustaining a career? It's hard not to feel that he's pissing on his chips with each successive release, but the intent behind what you could term his professional self-destruction renders the piss and chips a more artisanal dish, though it's unlikely to curry much favor.</p></div>"|17208.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17208-matricidal-sons-of-bitches/|4.9|Laura Snapes

Last year, in the same publication, Simon Reynolds <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/apr/14/balearics-ibiza-pop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">blamed</span></a> the genre's transformation into an ""overall banging boshing feel"" for the decline of Top 40 pop, with ""Dynamite"" by Taio Cruz acting as the main offender. Listening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28999-chad-valley/"" target=""_blank"">Chad Valley</a>'s debut LP, there's evidence for both Burgess and Reynolds' respective arguments: ""My Girl"" lifts a lyric from the Spice Girls' ""Wannabe"" almost verbatim, but ""Fall 4 U"" exemplifies Burgess' platonic ideal of Balearic, with Valley's voice curling like a saxophone against a pillowy, gently propulsive backbeat. On the other hand, you have the wince-inducing title track, which renders ""banging boshing"" 80s synth bass and wooden blocks in lurid colors.</p>
<p>""There's a hell of a lot of really awful pop music, and I actually really like it,"" <a href=""http://www.middleboopmag.com/music/music-news/chad-valley-exclusive-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> Hugo Manuel, the electronic producer behind Chad Valley and frontman of Oxford-based tropical pop group Jonquil. ""I've grown up thinking pop was such a dirty word with bands like Steps, which will never even be ironically cool or good in a retro way."" For the most part, however, <i>Young Hunger</i>'s fat bass, bongo breakdowns, and Manuel's bell-like tenor sound closer to 1980s and 90s balladeers that might never be ironically cool or good, like Billy Ocean (especially on ""Young Hunger"") or George Michael. </p>
<p>In contrast to the cool Biggie bounce of <i>Equatorial Ultravox</i>'s ""Reach Lines"" and the beach boombox-thick ""Ensoniq Funk"", Manuel sounds earnest on most of <i>Young Hunger</i>. After announcing, ""Tell all your friends/ Tell everyone/ That all that I can think about is you,"" he closes ""Tell All Your Friends"" with an ""ay-ee-ay-ee-ay"" that's definitely more Taio Cruz than Prins Thomas. A few songs later, as smooth as Al Jarreau atop a bed of Peruvian flutes, he tells guest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4788-el-perro-del-mar/"" target=""_blank"">El Perro Del Mar</a>, ""You know I want to do this together/ You know I want to go far."" She gamely responds, ""You're so excited,"" with the coyness of the female part on Next's ""Too Close"".</p>
<p>The many guests on <i>Young Hunger</i> prevent the album from getting too bogged down in schmaltz, adding color and texture to the record. Album opener ""I Owe You This"" features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28599-twin-shadow/"" target=""_blank"">Twin Shadow</a>'s George Lewis Jr.-- who, like Manuel, was tagged as chillwave until this year's <i>Confess</i> earned comparisons to bands like the Human League-- whose gritty lower register offsets Manuel's high, pure voice, but matches it in emotional weight, something that can't be said for Orlando Higginbottom of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29950-totally-enormous-extinct-dinosaurs/"" target=""_blank"">Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs</a>' part on ""My Life Is Complete"".</p>
<p>The only track on which Manuel doesn't appear vocally (aside from the instrumental ""Interlude"") is ""Fathering/Mothering"". It's a simple track, contracting with heavy beats and minimal atmospheric synthesizers as Anne Lise Frøkedal of Norwegian band Harry's Gym carries verses about the womb. It also builds differently than the rest of <i>Young </i>Hunger, getting louder and faster in the way that Chad Valley's older material did, Frøkedal singing, ""Getting louder than the sun."" After the rest of the album's clutter of neon-hued effects, ""Fathering/Mothering"" provides welcome space. </p>
<p>""Manimals"" closes <i>Young Hunger</i>, a similarly sparse and serious track featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28560-active-child/"" target=""_blank"">Active Child</a>'s Pat Grossi. His is the closest-- and slightly superior-- vocal match to Manuel, but his voice is shrouded in echo, as though he doesn't want to outdo him. Like Lewis Jr.'s contribution, it doesn't really add or detract anything vital from the record, but it's a nice touch among many. It's as though Manuel's afraid to let his numerous contributors take the spotlight, too often cluttering their voices with synthesizer effects. These flourishes generally add up to a record that's, as Manuel suggests, ""good in a retro way,"" but when Chad Valley loosens his grip on the keys and lets space rather than noise carry his songs (""Fall 4 U"", ""Manimals"", ""Fathering/Mothering""), the album soars instead of floats.</p></div>"|17210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17210-young-hunger/|7.0|Harley Brown

The elevator pitch goes like this: Hospitalized with debilitating Crohn's disease and estranged from his struggling, blue-collar indie rock band, a young man spends his confinement ""learning how to reinvent [his] body"" and transmogrifies into self-styled pop sensation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28232-diamond-rings/"" target=""_blank"">Diamond Rings</a>. Cue the gender-bending, rainbow-colored makeover, the bubblegum glam-rock songs made almost entirely on GarageBand, and the YouTube videos whose amateur choreography bravely and embarrassingly emphasizes the man's awkward and angular physicality. The soundtrack would make it worthwhile, though: Confessional and relentlessly melodic, ""All Yr Songs"", ""You Oughta Know"", and nearly everything else on 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14829-special-affections/"" target=""_blank""><i>Special Affections</i></a> functioned as guileless musical therapy, a genuinely inspiring record about transcending emotional and physical stagnation.</p>
<p>Two years later, Diamond Rings has far surpassed the still-active D'Urbervilles as well as O'Regan's previous Casio-pop duo Habitat, signed to a major label, and started performing live as a four-piece band. And for better or worse, <i>Free Dimensional </i>feels like a sequel, more professional, calculated, and occasionally satisfying, ultimately lacking the anything-goes magic that called for a sequel in the first place. On some level, O'Regan's aim on his second LP is similar to that of his fellow Canadians <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"" target=""_blank"">Japandroids</a>. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12965-post-nothing/"" target=""_blank""><i>Post-Nothing</i></a>, <i>Special Affections </i>was a surprise hit that generated a lot of its resonance from a total lack of pretension; this was music made out of personal necessity, with no idea if anyone was actually going to hear it. Having witnessed the effect of these records on live crowds, both try for something more universal that repeats the trick of the original while amplifying it. But whereas <i>Celebration Rock </i>successfully threw its arms around an ever-widening audience, <i>Free Dimensional </i>does something trickier, which is focus so much on the capital-s Self that O'Regan gets taken out of the picture completely. As you can tell from the titles-- ""I'm Just Me"", ""Hand Over My Heart"", ""(I Know) What I'm Made Of"", ""Stand My Ground"", self-empowerment, self-esteem and staying true to oneself are the name of the game, and the lyrics are presented with a lack of specificity that allows the listener to think of themselves every time O'Regan sings the word ""me.""</p>
<p>Maybe that's the goal, but it's also a mistake. While O'Regan's story wasn't essential to <i>Special Affections</i>, it did manage to give powerful context and emotional ballast to what otherwise could've been fairly fluffy songs. O'Regan's songwriting hasn't changed much and the machinistic approach here reveals the limitations that weren't apparent in a 10-song debut. For one thing, so many of his lyrics follow the same AAB/CCD pattern (""I don't know how to get where I'm going but I know I'm growing every day/ And if I fall I'll get back into it cause I know I'm doing it my own way,"" and so forth) that it ultimately makes <i>Free Dimensional </i>feel more like a word puzzle app than an artistic exercise, everything O'Regan says restricted to a small number of melodic contours or rhyme schemes. This is problematic since he is consciously drawing from the most basic elements of pop lyricism; after a while, the endless new hearts and fresh starts feel like the same old rut.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Free Dimensional </i>importing most of <i>Special Affections</i>' compositional tactics wholesale means that it's going to have some economic and catchy hooks no matter what. The sound isn't as novel as it was three years back, but Diamond Rings is forever distinguished by the brawny register of O'Regan's vocals. Trade in the white denim for blue, and he could join <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30530-divine-fits/"" target=""_blank"">Divine Fits</a> without missing a beat. His best songs function like ""Since U Been Gone"" in reverse, <i>starting </i>with the idea of mega-budget pop and filtering it through Strokes-esque, New Wave rock. The most guitar heavy-track here, ""Runaway Love"", recalls the surging highlights of Diamond Rings' past largely because it's a minor rewrite of ""Something Else"" and ""Wait &amp; See"". </p>
<p>The video for subsequent one-off single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cAqwco49m4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Show Me Your Stuff""</a> gave the impression that given the proper monetary freedom, Diamond Rings could and would go full-on Dr. Luke, Max Martin or RedOne. While co-produced by Damian Taylor (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"" target=""_blank"">Robyn</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4423-unkle/"" target=""_blank"">U.N.K.L.E.</a>), <i>Free Dimensional </i>doesn't go far enough to become undeniable; it's an upgrade from the Tinkertoy sound of <i>Special Affections</i>, but they still sound like an incremental upgrade, Lego constructions rather than the gleaming skyscrapers they need to be. The big moments are knowing winks and post-production graft: ""I'm Just Me"" co-opts the surge of an EDM drop into its chorus, ""Day &amp; Night"" is modeled after Gloria Estefan's ""1-2-3"", and while the rap section of ""(I Know) What I'm Made Of"" is likely intended to be along the lines of those wedged into ""Hangin' Tough"" or Bobby Brown's ""Don't Be Cruel"", you still have to hear O'Regan rap. You'd think the namedrops of bell hooks and ""Buffalo Stance"" would disarm any critical faculty, but when he ends it snarling, ""don't you ever even think of tryin' to [BLEEP!] with me,"" it's more proof that frothy pop recreations from acts with indie backgrounds are often prone to wincing self-awareness.</p>
<p>Though <i>Free Dimensional </i>is proud to be out of step both sonically and personally, in a strange way it loops back into a new kind of currency alongside the pop-star self-actualization of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a>, Robyn, or Carly Rae Jepsen that's found currency amongst those who would identify as ""indie"" listeners. As much as they draw from the style and sound of 80s teen-pop, they crucially embody the appeal of its accompanying ""starmaking"" accessories such as in-mall concerts and ""record your own song!"" karaoke booths: <i>T</i><i>his could be you</i>. It strikes a balance between the power of relatability and the transformative power of pop music-- the songs draw you in, the image stokes your imagination, and their down-to-earth personalities makes pop-star self-actualization far more realistic than it does in the form of Lady Gaga or Beyonc<span>é</span>, i.e., people you could really only ""be"" on Halloween. O'Regan understands that, but he's missing half the equation here. <i>Free Dimensional </i>is an homage to certain styles of pop; what made <i>Special Affections </i>such an unexpectedly powerful document was how it managed to be a tribute to pop itself, more specifically the literally life-altering capacity of it.

But Banks' work under his original solo guise, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27815-julian-plenti/"">Julian Plenti</a>, was essentially in the same vein as Interpol's hooky, glowering post-punk. Now he's dropped the Julian Plenti façade and is recording under his given name, even going so far as to call his new record <i>Banks</i>. The suggestion seems to be that we're finally going to get some real, unfiltered Paul Banks this time around. But <i>Banks</i> presents an artist who has matured but hasn't established a strong sense of individual identity.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The Interpol of its iconic post-9/11, early 2000s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4113-turn-on-the-bright-lights/""><span class=""s1""><i>Turn on the Bright Lights </i></span></a>period was, if not a dance band, then a coke and Red Bull nightlife outfit. The atmosphere was dark, but the tempos were electric and celebratory, sprinting into rain and rubble-streaked New York City streets with the abandon of survivors determined to chase away demons and seek out fun while it still can be had. <i>Banks</i>, in contrast, is sluggish, unsteady, and ultimately noncommittal about forward motion. </p>
<p class=""p2"">Paul Banks worked on <i>Banks</i> over the course of two years during free time on the road with Interpol. As Banks <a href=""http://drownedinsound.com/news/4145601-stream--interpols-paul-banks-new-album-banks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told Drowned in Sound</a>, the songs started out as a diversion, offering a form of release and entertainment as he endured the boring monotony of touring on a big-time rock tour. But the enthusiasm doesn't come through. The album is a pea soup of gray synths, middling mid-tempo rhythms, and Banks' ghost-of-goth's-past vocals. On ""Over My Shoulder"", a syncopated, clattering beat comes to tortured, lurching life, but the whole operation is so joyless that it's rendered impotent. Ditto for the trip-hoppy opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13998-the-base/"">""The Base""</a>, where Banks' flat, monotone vocal drones over an anemically grinding guitar like a last breath about to rise from a barely pulsating body. </p>
<p class=""p2""><i>Banks </i>telegraphs a deep sense of gloom and ennui brought on by the patina of middle age. If Paul Banks once made music designed as a soundtrack for staying out all night, he now sounds like a guy who'd prefer to turn in by 10. But acting more grown-up doesn't necessarily make Banks seem any wiser. On ""Paid For That"", he awkwardly reaches for insightful introspection about the aging process, musing—in his trademark lyrical Esperanto-- that ""sometimes I think I coexist with me/ And one side makes me old/ And one side makes me struggle/ I was on the night shift/ I said I'll never learn to fight like this."" That line is crystal clear compared with the confounding melodrama of ""Young Again"", which includes one of Banks' all-time head-scratchers: ""<span>Jobs are disgraceful/ They tick like suffering from a clock</span>.""</p>
<p class=""p2"">But the main problem with <i>Banks </i>isn't the muddled words, it's the uninvolving music.<i> </i>Some of the tracks simply aren't given the chance to reach their potential: ""No Mistakes"" and ""I'll Sue You"" aren't great songs necessarily, but they'd sound a lot better if they were played by a good band (like, say, Interpol) that could give them a groove and a stronger sense of purpose. But Paul Banks' primary concern with <i>Banks </i>seems to be with creating a uniform mood of malevolence. The pretty ""Arise, Awake"" and the demented ""Young Again"" achieve this reasonably well, but they hardly play to Banks' strength, which is mining pop gold out of the contrast between the inertia of his polarizing vocals and swift, assured music. When the music is as stationary as <i>Banks</i> is, the result is unsurprisingly static.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Then again, some of the material on <i>Banks </i>would be weak even with better presentation, like the instrumental ""Lisbon"", which is inoffensive background music and not much more. The best song by a mile on <i>Banks</i>, the album-closing ""Summertime Is Coming"", was already released this summer on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16707-julian-plenti-lives-ep/""><span class=""s1""><i>Julian Plenti Lives… </i></span></a>EP. As Brian Howe wrote in his review, ""the liquid guitar line of 'Summertime' is enticingly familiar-- a welcome reminder in all the hodgepodge that Banks' music has specific good qualities."" In other words, the best parts of <i>Banks </i>are the ones that most resemble Interpol, rather than the stabs at spooky, old-guy mope-pop that comprise most of the record. In that respect, this album<i> </i>fails as a valid statement outside of the confines of Banks' band. But as sour as <i>Banks </i>ultimately is, it doesn't automatically preclude him from having a worthy solo career. He could potentially forge a new direction away from Interpol, just not <i>this </i>direction. </p></div>"|17262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17262-banks/|5.8|Steven Hyden

The killer keeps pet pigeons. The thief drops change in a bum's cup as karmic reimbursement. Even Lucille Bluth would occasionally shed a tear if she could spare the moisture. Maybe Baudelaire put it best: the Devil's greatest trick is convincing people he doesn't exist. But Baudelaire never dealt with Ikea parking lots, petroleum executives, or Reddit trolls. </p>
<p>Tobacco's greatest trick is reminding people that not only does the devil exist, he keeps a Pittsburgh address. Since <a href=""http://blackmothsuperrainbow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Moth Super Rainbow</a> came to attention with 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10246-dandelion-gum/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dandelion Gum</i></a>,<i> </i>the band's demon-throated frontman has mastered the art of sounding sinister. He's so upfront with his intent that the group's new Kickstarter-funded album <i>Cobra Juicy</i> has a song called ""I Think I'm Evil"". He also named himself after the most pernicious herb since hemlock. </p>
<p>Of course, you can point to any number of metal bands or horrorcore rap groups who have brandished the triple six as a way to sell records and satisfy their evil urges. What's unique about Black Moth Super Rainbow is the balance achieved between the grotesque and the beautiful. This is not as easy as it sounds. Descend too deeply into darkness, and you run the risk of becoming fright-night schlock. Lean too delicately on seraphic chords and melodies and you lack menace. And should you lack the pop sensibilities, your satanic majesty's request can get exhausting. Examine the more underwhelming moments of the Odd Future catalog to see what happens when N.E.R.D. never quite meet nihilism. </p>
<p>From jump, Black Moth Super Rainbow have been unfairly tarred as gimmickry. This stems from several reasons. First, there are the names sounding straight from an un-purchased Adult Swim pilot. Tobacco, Iffernaut, Ryan Graveface, Bullsmear, and the Seven Fields of Aphelion. Ex-members include Father Hummingbird and Power Pill Fist (who presumably left to join Danny Brown's Bruiser Brigade). Then there's the band's semi-anonymity and penchant for shrouding themselves in darkness, wearing masks, and performing backed by 80s aerobics videos. Yet it's mostly the voice. Tobacco uses a vocoder on every song. This isn't the Teutonic turtle-necked modulation of Kraftwerk, the mad-scientist whimsy of Bruce Haack, or the funky lothario of Roger Troutman. This is when the robot supposed to solve your problems goes awry; it's the musical equivalent of the animated automatons at Itchy &amp; Scratchyland attacking the Simpsons. </p>
<p>Slot Black Moth Super Rainbow as psychedelic at your own peril. There are no yawning guitar solos and the songs rarely slink past the four-minute mark. Black Moth Super Rainbow triangulate early Beck and the Air of the ""Kelly Watch the Stars"" era. But neither cognate flashes the crooked smile of <i>Cobra Juicy.</i> Even the title itself seeks to pair the contradictory ideas of vitamins and venom. </p>
<p>Opening track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13924-windshield-smasher/"" target=""_blank"">""Windshield Smasher""</a> features vocals that sound like gorgons moaning, paired with synthesizers that sound like they got bubble gum got stuck in the gears. The drums snap like the trap floor at a hanging. They are a band explicitly antithetical to the idea of Rap Genius. They've always been purposely obfuscating, but <i>Cobra Juicy</i>'s lyrics are even more difficult to decipher than usual. It is pop as Rorschach blot. You hear what you want bubbling out of the murk. Yours ears absorb toxic effluvia about kissing gasoline and shattering glass. Devil's Night finally gets the soundtrack that D-12 could never deliver. </p>
<p>""Hairspray Heart"" finds Tobacco wailing about ""sucking all the poison from a snakebite"" and ""a fucking diamond falling from my fucking eyes"" over freeway underpass-dirty drums and rainbow sherbet synths. ""Psychic Love Damage"" is swooning ballad that might be the closest BMSR come to romantic, but even then, the lover's smiles ""wreck"" him. ""We Burn"" channels folk singer era Beck, if he was abducted and forced to entertain Xenu and John Travolta.</p>
<p>Other than would-be mission statement, ""I Think I'm Evil"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14368-gangs-in-the-garden/"" target=""_blank"">""Gangs in the Garden""</a> might be the song that best encapsulates the helter-skelter aesthetic. There is synth bass, a beat that could soundtrack a robbery at a roller rink, distorted guitars, and vocals that channel the voice of the snake in the Garden of Eden. All this would be schtick if not for Tobacco's ever-improving pop gifts. Wait for the bridge at 1:20 of ""Blurring My Day"" when the chaos relents for a few seconds like a confession metaphysically wiping away weeks of sin. If this is psychedelia, it's only in the sense that each song replicates the intensity of the trip: the suicidal lows and the love-is-everything highs. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This might be BMSR's most accessible effort, but if you couldn't get past the vocoder and voodoo before, it's unlikely that you will now. This is a cult, one large enough to raise over $100K to fund this record-- led by a man advocating cutting Kool-Aid with cyanide and always inviting new members. </p></div>"|17134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17134-cobra-juicy/|7.6|Jeff Weiss

When writer Joe Clay asked who might headline the festival of that unnamed member's dreams, they answered, ""If Holger Czukay and Geezer Butler had a son, it would be him. Just him playing bass for a couple of days."" The Goathead described the band's live performances as ""the harvesting of souls,"" and its lifestyle as ""invocations, prayers, and total rejoice!""</p>
<p>Beneath that jester veneer, though, there's a much more serious idealism at work here. As key member <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/09798-goat-world-music-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Christian Johansson told <i>The Quietus</i> in an earlier interview</a>, Goat stems from a loose and long-running collective of townspeople in Korpilombolo, a village with a population of a few hundred in the northwest hook of Sweden. Though people in the town have been playing under that name in various incarnations for several decades, the nine-song, steady-burning <i>World Music</i> is the unit's first proper release. That alleged tradition, it seems, is mostly an excuse for being a true band or collective rather than a collection of personalities, <a href=""http://www.socialmediaphilanthropy.com/2011/08/08/the-rise-of-microcelebrity/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vying for the attention of micro-celebrity at a time when that's easy enough to find.</a> To wit, they wear masks on stage and discuss the details of membership-- who has been in the band, who will be in the band, who is currently in the band-- in incredibly ambiguous terms. ""In northern Sweden-- it is hard to explain in English-- it is about not drawing attention to yourself. The important thing is what you do, not who does it,"" explained Johansson. ""This is why we never have tried to make ourselves heard before now."" The songs matter more than the sources.</p>
<p>That approach of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts largely defines <i>World Music</i>, a psychedelic rock record that strangely never seems hyperbolic. It's fun and often dizzying, employing a kaleidoscope of unexpected tones and far-flung influences. But it doesn't feel forced. Over insistent rhythms that suggest Spacemen 3 and, at least in spirit, the conjuring drones of Pandit Pran Nath and La Monte Young, Goat weave an ecumenical history of rock'n'roll. They intercept signals from Led Zeppelin and Funkadelic, Jefferson Starship and Fela Kuti, the Congos and the Rolling Stones, bending them into a resiliently consistent album. Sure, opener ""Diarabi"" finishes with a brief drum solo, but that span flows naturally from the song's steady ascent of tangled guitars and distant keyboards; it feels less like a solo than the end of the song. ""Let it Bleed"" is a mildly funky number with powerfully strutting (and anonymous) female vocals, suggesting ESG in its sass and sizzle. But even its syncopation seems somehow reserved, taking care not to come too hard or too heavy. With its fuzz-tone bass, wah-wah love, and chanted vocals, ""Goatman"" is the record's traditionally heaviest track, keying on a guitar solo that sounds as though played with barbed wire. Still, Goat seem to be holding back, tempering sizzle and drive with a proper modicum of listlessness. This might sound tepid to some; to me, at least, it's an invitation for immersion.  </p>
<p>Like their fellow Swedes in Dungen, Goat have succeeded in not only borrowing the sounds of yore but reinvigorating them, creating a record that doesn't mimic the past wholesale so much as re-contextualize its components. But for all of Dungen's musical bustle and urgency, Goat seems preternaturally at ease with this stuff, soaking insistent beats with lysergic tones and high-flying hooks. If their creation myth is dubious (and it seems to be), its ethos-- this music is an extension of traditions, so there's no need to rush it or demand that it make them famous-- might not be. The short and infinitely catchy ""Run to Your Mama"" could be a single, but it isn't polished or produced enough to be meant that way. ""Goatlord"" coasts over a tide of pump organ and casually strummed acoustic guitar, existing in a Velvets haze until an electric guitar solo-- nasty and snarling, like Comets on Fire falling back to earth-- finally intersects it. When the drift returns, the electric guitar sticks with it, following it toward the exit. It's a fitting illustration of the band's philosophical insistence that all of this is world music-- ancient and modern, accessible and mutable. </p>
<p>I wonder if, in a matter of months, the world were to learn that the story of Goat was one of complete hokum, would it matter? That is, if their tales of Korpilombolo and voodoo and ancestors passing down a tradition of inclusive and now-electrified ritual music were false, does it matter? Probably: Despite the detail droves that the internet and itinerant social media allow, a sense of mystery still begets a sense of wonder. Perhaps you and your friends could begin your own Goat, live a myth of your own making? </p>
<p>But at least at this moment, Goat afford listeners the opportunity to press pause on self-obsessed information cycles, to push past the noise of minutiae, check into their wonderfully vague story, and check out with a wonderful record. Indeed, if certain components of Goat's lore prove to be just that, they have, with <i>World Music</i>, created a vivid manifestation of the ideals they've espoused. ""We've been taught since we were small to have an understanding of not only western bands, but of music from other parts of the world,"" Johansson told <i>The Quietus</i>, a sentiment echoed <a href=""http://gildedgutterblog.blogspot.com/2012/08/goat-interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">when the band told another interviewer that its influences include birdsongs and food</a>. ""The title <i>World Music</i> was chosen because we believe we play 'world music,' and that's what we think everyone plays."" For all its psychedelic tendencies and marketing trappings, Goat's <i>World Music</i> feels as assured and unfussy as folk music.</p></div>"|17332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17332-world-music/|8.1|Grayson Currin

Ambarchi has reached an enviable point, where he can indulge wildly creative urges and find multiple outlets willing to put them out into the world. <i>Connected</i> is the latest of those, a five-track album released with fellow Australian musician and artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30808-robin-fox/"">Robin Fox</a>, with <a href=""http://kranky.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kranky</a> the lucky recipients of their work. The title is taken from a work by dance company <a href=""http://www.chunkymove.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chunky Move</a>, whose artistic director Gideon Obarzanek asked the pair to co-compose the soundtrack. It's all slow-build wordless mantras, sometimes ascending to crisp peaks, at other times locked down in a sense of permanent anticipation. Traits like ""haste"" and ""urgency"" have been firmly smudged out of the frame.</p>
<p>It's to Ambarchi and Fox's credit that there's no sense of these pieces serving another purpose, achieving the often strived for (but rarely achieved) ideal of dual-purpose soundtrack work that's equally strong when stripped of the work it purports to support. On <i>Connected</i> it's often difficult to see how a dance troupe would find a way to pull movement from such static grooves, a feeling supported by the sheer strength and vision of the music. Simply put, this feels like a world unto itself, crashing from lightly strung krautrock into ear-piercing digital glitch. It's hard to envision another layer on top of it all provided by Obarzanek's dancers, just as it's tough to imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">the Fall</a>'s <i>I Am Kurious Oranj</i> being used by Michael Clark as a ballet score. Sometimes soundtracks work better without any visual stimulus-- it's better to succumb to the sheet-of-ice electronics of ""Invigilation"" from <i>Connected</i> instead of struggling to see how it ties in with another artform.</p>
<p>The colossal nine-minute opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14434-standing-mandala/"">""Standing Mandala""</a> was used to preview this album, and it's a track that leaves much of the rest of the material cowering in its wake. It's an extension of Ambarchi's work on this year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16977-sagittarian-domain/""><i>Sagittarian Domain</i></a>, which took a similarly poised approach to repetition. There's always a creeping sense that it might be heading somewhere, perhaps a swollen torrent of distortion hidden around the corner, or a wrong-footed chord change looming on the horizon. Those things never arrive. Instead, the song is cut abruptly just when it feels like it might be reaching some kind of climax. Ambarchi and Fox clearly aren’t interested in ""destination."" This is music that's all journey, no resolution. ""Game of Two"" circles in place in a similar way to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>'s <i>Dead Man</i> score, where distended guitar chords are simply allowed to be. The lack of forward momentum makes everything feel suspended in time, hanging in infinite space.</p>
<p>Repetition is the pivot around which <i>Connected</i> turns, although it's the only stylistic keepsake Fox and Ambarchi clutch onto throughout the record. They shift through moods with each successive track, taking in morose ambient textures on the title track and penetrative electronic noise on ""Trios"". The latter generates a feeling akin to having shards of glass stuffed into your ears, so high are the frequencies. At times it feels like the track is going to implode as the pair steadily layers on great piles of malfunctioning electronics, ultimately returning to the trick they pulled off on ""Standing Mandala"" by simply cutting everything dead when they reach peak intensity. It's as though Ambarchi and Fox caught themselves going somewhere and had to stop short, retaining their sense of composure by pulling the listener back to a feeling of stasis. <i>Connected</i> is far from being the first record to make a virtue out of spinning in place, but there's a discipline and control here that's rarely heard, a feeling of two musicians utterly dominating their craft.</p></div>"|17339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17339-connected/|6.8|Nick Neyland

That description could just as well extend to the whole album. In the earliest stages of writing <i>Animator</i>, the Montreal four-piece received news of a close friend's unexpected death, and the album that they put together in the months after this shock is suffused with grief, spiritual questioning, and the occasional haunting. In this context, a tension that's always been at the heart of the Luyas music-- a tug-of-war between chirpy, playful sounds and dark, brooding feelings-- becomes more pronounced than ever. The near-nine-minute opener ""Montuno"" begins in elegantly buoyant tempo, like a prizewinner's trot. ""I was gonna die,"" Jessie Stein sings, her coy peep of a voice making the bleak line that much more jarring. ""Be fed to the horses.""</p>
<p>""Montuno"" is an elegiac, ambitious, and affecting orchestral pop arrangement divided into three movements, a fact that should place the Luyas in context a little better than their geographical coordinates do. Though they hail from Montreal, the Luyas' brand of art-pop has little in common with the DIY electro-- think Grimes and Majical Cloudz-- that's currently serving as shorthand for their hometown's signature sound. The band instead recalls a time when ""Montreal"" was still synonymous with the stately, string-lined macabre of early Arcade Fire and Bell Orchestre, and the similarities aren't coincidental-- the arrangements were composed and performed by members of those bands. Sparse, understated strings courtesy of Arcade Fire violinist Sara Neufeld give <i>Animator</i> a subtly evocative atmosphere, while horns by Bell Orchestre's Pietro Amato infuse Stein's lyricism (""Sometimes I feel like a deaf woman dancing,"" she sings on ""Earth Turner"") with a sense of muted majesty.</p>
<p>Though Stein's voice can be one-note and sometimes lacks the necessary dynamism or range to keep these songs moving to new places, her lyrics are often striking. ""Channeling"" is a moving account of the inspiration she draws from her friend's memory (""I am listening to your voice/ I am trying to hear its key,"" she sings, ""Put your song in me""), while the album's most entrancing melody, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13977-fifty-fifty/"" target=""_blank"">""Fifty Fifty""</a>, gets its name from a bit of poetic nihilism, ""Asked my friend what he believes/ He said, 'Fifty fifty.'"" Some of the album's most evocative imagery, though, comes from ""Face"", a song in which the contrast of <i>Animator</i>'s ever-present ghost makes her feel trapped in her own corporeality. ""I thought of you/ 'Everything,' I said, 'Is some kind of tether,'"" she sings over the uneasy moan of Neufeld's strings. ""I try to lose my face.""</p>
<p>Still, as evocative as they are on the page, many of these lyrics fail to come to life over the course of a record that often feels diffuse, meandering, and cold. All of the elements that make up <i>Animator</i>'s sound-- the distended creak of guitars, hallowed beds of analog synth, and Stein's sing-song melodies-- float through its zero-gravity atmosphere like lonely meteors, never providing the drama or satisfaction of crescendo.</p>
<p>This isn't always the case with the Luyas. Their solid 2011 album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15154-too-beautiful-to-work/"" target=""_blank"">Too Beautiful to Work</a></i>, found a balance between deep space firmaments and the blunt impact of vivid, stirring hooks; the atmosphere drew you in but off-kilter melodies of songs like ""Cold Canada"", ""What Mercy Is"", and the title track lingered long after the record was over. Though inspired by weightier and more evocative themes, <i>Animator</i> already feels less memorable-- it seems to constantly evade the listener's grasp. The skittish ""Your Name's Mostly Water"" lifts the famous epitaph from John Keats' grave-- ""Here lies One Whose Name was writ in Water,"" chiseled, ironically, into the chilly permanence of stone. It's a fitting invocation for a record preoccupied with the ephemeral nature of life and the cold cruelty of death, but it's unfortunate that this epitaph also describes immateriality of its melodies and the transience of its pleasures.</p></div>"|17336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17336-animator/|5.9|Lindsay Zoladz

After spending their first three albums deftly balancing artistry and aggression, their next two Interscope releases over-reached for rock-operatic opulence and crashed hard. But with 2009's transitory <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12703-the-century-of-self/"" target=""_blank""><i>The </i><i>Century of Self</i></a>, the band started to replenish its intensity. By 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15101-tao-of-the-dead/"" target=""_blank"">The Tao of the Dead</a>, </i>there were more encouraging reminders of what this band does best: play punk rock with the grandiose ambition of prog, rather than attempting the latter outright.</p>
<p>But where even <i>Tao</i> couldn't resist signing off with a 16-minute multi-sectional opus, <i>Lost Songs</i> matches its predecessor's brisk momentum without devoting an entire side of vinyl to a single track. It's almost as if, instead of releasing a 10th-anniversary edition of 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/178-source-tags-and-codes/"" target=""_blank""><i>Source Tags and Codes</i></a> (their most celebrated album, though I think 1999's <i>Madonna</i> is every bit its equal), Trail of Dead opted to create something new using the same schematics. Lead-off track ""Open Doors"" even echoes the relentless, in-the-red rumble of <i>Source Tags</i>' introductory salvo ""It Was There That I Saw You""; it's also the one song here that breaches the five-minute mark, setting the tone for what is arguably Trail of Dead's leanest album to date. </p>
<p>This stripped-down approach is as much a conceptual device as the band's most ornate efforts: <i>Lost Songs</i> is reportedly Trail of Dead's response to what they see as a culture of passivity endemic to contemporary indie rock and, accordingly, they've dedicated the album to imprisoned performance-art punks Pussy Riot. The concept extends to the visual: the group's famously elaborate and colorful artwork is replaced here by a rough black-and-white sketch redolent of an old-school hardcore flyer.</p>
<p>Trail of Dead's attempts at cultural critique have backfired in the past-- the title track to 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/182-worlds-apart/"" target=""_blank""><i>Worlds Apart</i></a> complained of MTV pop-punk posers while sounding not unlike a Blink-182 song itself. But <i>Lost Songs</i> is a successful pairing of intent and execution. Jason Reece's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14392-catatonic/"" target=""_blank"">""Catatonic""</a> wages its war on apathy with a frenzied, Fugazi-worthy charge, its hypnotic riff standing in for a smartphone-numbed generation about to be jolted awake; ""Pinhole Cameras"" and ""Bright Young Things"" bulk up their Grant Hart-moulded power-pop melodies till they sound like the Hüsker Düde. At its best, <i>Lost Songs</i>' take on post-hardcore imagines an alternate history where indie rock's first-wave originators got to rule the modern-rock radio landscape of the 1990s, rather than just serve as an increasingly diluted influence upon it.</p>
<p><i>Lost Songs</i>' mission is muddied somewhat by a weighty mid-album stretch, as Trail of Dead sacrifice speed and scrappiness for heavy bluster on ""A Place to Rest"" and ""Flower Card Games"" (the latter of which-- like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9630-so-divided/"" target=""_blank""><i>So Divided</i></a>'s ""Naked Sun"" before it-- confirms that this band becomes less interesting the bluesier they get). But <i>Lost Songs</i> in turn reminds us that Trail of Dead excel at more than just apocalyptic, drum-set-toppling, thrash-and-burn. Its most resonant track, ""Awestruck"", is also its most atypically pretty, a close cousin to <i>Source Tags</i>' ""Relative Ways"" that buttresses its kaleidoscope-eyed melody with layers of gleaming guitars. But even here, the sense of reverie is undercut by a call to action: ""Get awestruck,"" Conrad Keely demands, yearning for a time when a band could be your life, not just a lifestyle accessory. With this album, we have reason to heed his advice. Though <i>Lost Songs</i>' namesake track serves as an attack on meaningless wallpaper indie, it's no accident that the title also presents the record as an artifact-- and a golden opportunity to rediscover a band that had to get a little lost in order to find itself again.</p></div>"|17220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17220-lost-songs/|8.0|Stuart Berman

Four albums later, Matt &amp; Kim still have exactly one idea, and it's barely expounded upon on <i>Lightning. </i>Matt Johnson still sticks to the cheesiest synth sounds and sings in a cloying whine that is the height of indie twerpiness. Kim Schifino is tasked with supplying the group's ""punk"" energy, but her drumming remains shackled within the confines of Matt &amp; Kim's stultifying song structures. </p>
<p><i>Lightning </i>is a regressive record even by Matt &amp; Kim's standards, marking a retreat from the slicked-up advances of 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14806-sidewalks/"" target=""_blank"">Sidewalks</a>. </i>With the able assistance of producer Ben Allen, Matt &amp; Kim appeared to be making an honest effort to compete in the pop marketplace on<i> Sidewalks</i>, engaging with hip-hop while buffing up the melodies to a radio-ready gloss and generally de-smirking the dance grooves. Probably not coincidentally, <i>Sidewalks </i>ended up being Matt &amp; Kim's highest charting record to date. While it's not quite accurate to suggest that Matt &amp; Kim were pushing forward musically, the group did seem to be on the verge of becoming a real pop band without the quote marks.</p>
<p><i>Lightning </i>on the other hand is a back-to-basics album, which in Matt &amp; Kim's case is very basic indeed. ""Now"" is typical of the simplicity of Matt &amp; Kim’s songwriting, with its monotonous keyboard squiggle, stiff rhythm, and repetitive chorus. Like ""Now"", ""It's Alright"" repeats its title refrain what feels like 142 times in the space of three minutes. Ditto that for the interminable ""I Said"", a four-minute pop song that feels much longer. By comparison, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46960-listen-matt-kim-lets-go/"" target=""_blank"">""Let's Go""</a> is relatively musically diverse, changing tempos and moving from the requisite lame synth sounds to spare piano chords. But it's still twice as long as it needs to be; as is Matt &amp; Kim's custom, it takes a marginally charming concept and forcibly beats out every last remnant of freshness, and then beats it some more.</p>
<p>Perhaps the car-alarm blaring of ""Overexposed"" and the limp hip-hop homage ""I Wonder"" translate better in a live setting, where Matt &amp; Kim have long been celebrated as energetic purveyors of body-moving meathead jams. But on record, these songs sound like parodies of unsophisticated ""fun"" pop music made by people who don't have a clue what makes unsophisticated pop truly enjoyable. In the context of Matt &amp; Kim's discography, <i>Lightning </i>is inconsequential. Like an echo of an echo, there's nothing here that Matt &amp; Kim haven't already done over and over again.</p></div>"|17335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17335-lightning/|5.1|Steven Hyden

In 2012, he's still in the middle of things but a <i>lot </i>more people are paying attention. His friend and colleague Claire Boucher has become indie's breakout star of the year as Grimes and his former bandmates in Gobble Gobble aren't far behind: that would be Megan James and Corin Roddick of Purity Ring.</p>
<p><i>Little Sleepwalker</i>, Frena's first official album as <a href=""http://borngold.us/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Born Gold</a>, doesn't have the populist ambitions of his peers, but after last year's free<i> </i>singles compilation <i>Bodysongs</i>, it does show an intent to be taken seriously. He's dialed down the theatrical Xiu Xiu influence (while showcasing a darker tone), ditches the snow shovel guitars he wielded as Gobble Gobble, and has changed the name from Gobble Gobble to something that <i>looks </i>more like that of a headliner. (I mean, he did his <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/leorgalil/2012/08/13/exclusive-interview-born-golds-cecil-frena-on-his-new-album-little-sleepwalker/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first interview with <i>Forbes</i></a>.) But while <i>Little Sleepwalker </i>is noticeably slicker and more fluid than Gobble Gobble or <i>Bodysongs</i>, the tradeoff is that it's almost impossible to grasp.</p>
<p>The deviation from Gobble Gobble's more overt hyperactivity will surely be seen as progress, but Born Gold's music is every bit as fractured, the colder and darker hues of the constituent pieces making it sound more mature and workmanlike. There are plenty of layers signifying activity, but not much depth signifying achievement: pitched electronic drum rolls, Far East vocal modes, 808 claps, and juddering synth lines all fight for space amidst dubbed-out sound effects. If you and a couple friends decided to give <i>Silent Shout </i>the <i>Zaireeka </i>treatment, or Of Montreal donned raven masks instead of Technicolor dreamcoats ca. <i>Skeletal Lamping</i>,<i> </i>there'd be precedent for this.</p>
<p>Amidst all this clutter, hooks do arise occasionally almost by default: a surprisingly sour melodic turn during ""That Way"", a pinched intonation of ""cadaverous time"" on ""Lethe"". As Frena told <i>Forbes</i>, <i>Little Sleepwalker </i>""is going to be disorienting... because pop is usually on the throne and not the vivisection table."" But so much of what goes on between these rare hooks feels like unnecessary surgery. It's a rhythm-centric record whose production overlays what might be incompatible edges of dubstep (Burial version), footwork, hip-hop, EDM, and straight electro-pop. Though little of it achieves the momentum required to dance to it for longer than a minute, <i>Little Sleepwalker</i>'s greatest asset is currency, giving just enough of itself to pretty much every electronic subgenre a pop fan might be curious about these days. </p>
<p>You do sense a streak of curiosity from Born Gold that will also play well amongst the kids. As with Purity Ring, Frena's main takeway from the Knife has less to do with arepeggiators than the freeing effects of vocal manipulation. It's a lot easier to indulge in character studies or outré ideas when the right filters make <i>you </i>believe you can be anybody. Or you could be nobody, that's a possibility as well. Rather than creating new perspectives, highlighting the emotional tenor of certain lyrics, or even introducing contradictory textures, Frena mostly just fucks with sound whenever the feeling moves him, clicking at new tabs like a bored office drone.</p>
<p>The randomly denatured vocals simply blending into the mix leeched of melody and artifice, and if the words of <i>Little Sleepwalker </i>are meant to carry much weight, he's not tipping us off to it. Occasionally, an image like ""lift your shivering knees and sleepwalk through the woods"" comes through the labyrinth of filters, and it's a clue that Frena might've shared a few lyrical ideas with Purity Ring when they were putting their first songs together. The second half of <i>Little Sleepwalker </i>does away with most of the vocals and straightens out rhythmically, and for better or worse, it's much easier to just zone out. A spree of impressionistic titles (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14318-sky-bicycle/"" target=""_blank"">""Sky Bicycle""</a>, ""Black Sonar"", ""Gauze Pillars"") aren't particularly descriptive of the contents therein, but are about all you can do to differentiate them from each other.</p>
<p>Though <i>Bodysongs </i>and <i>Little Sleepwalker </i>were meant to be an introduction to Born Gold's new artistic M.O. in tandem, it's not all that far off from what I heard having seen Gobble Gobble open for damn near everyone who was everyone over the past couple of years. It's not necessarily bad or inept, but it's missing something on record-- either a captivating visual element, the approval of a jacked-up crowd, or at least a point of view. Undoubtedly, Born Gold's of-the-minute sound and associations will find him in bigger rooms, but that last part in particular explains why <i>Little Sleepwalker </i>feels like Frena keeping pacing with his now more well-known friends while remaining a step behind.</p></div>"|17257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17257-little-sleepwalker/|5.7|Ian Cohen

Singing the love-struck lyrics that David Longstreth had written about her, and their relationship, Coffman looked bashful and eye-rolling in the way you only can when someone's saying something genuinely kind about you in public-- but with the added pressure of having to sing the flattering words herself. Romance with a band member is always going to cause compromises, and the break-up of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29345-dark-dark-dark/"" target=""_blank"">Dark Dark Dark</a>'s Nona Marie Invie and Marshall LaCount in the middle of touring their last album, 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14926-wild-go/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wild Go</i></a>, provoked a question in the title of their third that looks a lot like an ultimatum: <i>Who Needs Who</i>?</p>
<p>The title of the Minneapolis band's new full-length is curious, given that Invie and LaCount's decision to keep the band together implies a mutual dependence, at least creatively. What ensues in part is a rebalancing of the two founding members' roles. On <i>Wild Go</i>, LaCount's banjo playing was prominent, and he sang a little, but the focus on <i>Who Needs Who</i> is predominantly on Invie: her voice, her piano playing, whether romantic, baroque, or angling for a part on the ""Treme"" score, and most pertinent of all, what appears to be her take on affairs. While Invie never pleads for sympathy or preferential understanding at his expensive, it's hard not to think of how awkward <i>Who Needs Who</i> must have been to make; the result paints a picture of LaCount sitting in the gallery while Invie holds court in the dock. Fortunately for them, a five-month hiatus between the end of one tour and the recording of this album allowed for a clarity of mind and clearing of grudges, with the decision to rehearse and record in New Orleans potentially lending a little perspective (and musical patronage).</p>
<p>While Invie's lyrics are less beholden to imagery and metaphor than they were on <i>Wild Go</i>, the fact that she's staring at LaCount when singing these songs means that she inevitably focuses on what's no longer there between them, despite his physical presence. On the opening title track, which feels like ""Fairytale of New York"" reinterpreted as a jazz club lament, it's ""the memory of trust""; on the elegant piano chime of ""Patsy Cline"", Invie describes ""an old photograph that I don't even have,"" and admits, ""I think of it now,"" so many memories and actualities removed from the original moment that it captured. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13782-tell-me/"" target=""_blank"">""Tell Me""</a> longs to ""live in the time when you cherished me,"" falling gorgeously between the sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a> and the late Laura Nyro.</p>
<p>The tone of Invie's voice and knottiness of her piano playing bring to mind early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/116-fiona-apple/"" target=""_blank"">Fiona Apple</a>, though what's lacking in that regard is Apple's lyrical bite. Until the final three songs of this 10-track collection, Invie's primary shade is regret steeped in sadness, until she unexpectedly and slightly awkwardly pivots into a bitterer groove. What pushes her lyrics beyond the realm of wallowing is how plain affecting a storyteller she can be, buoyed by the cinematic resonance of the slimmed-down band. You'd never catch Apple singing, ""I would never ask about other nights/ Only a fool would spoil it all,"" as Invie does on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14073-how-it-went-down/"" target=""_blank"">""How it Went Down""</a>, but the way she gets dressed up for the ceremony of giving a particular moment another chance-- ""So take your time/ 'Cause taking it here means taking me home""-- and how the sadness has aged her while the fellow protagonist has remained young, is tremendously sad, and made more so by how the band sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Three</a> attempting a lullaby. The song that follows it, ""It's a Secret"", invites someone to ""press your ear to my chest"" in order to uncover the ineffable truth that makes Invie the way she is, hidden to her and torturous for it, as LaCount loops his clarinet into a baroque dissonance.</p>
<p>These unusual musical flairs pop up all over <i>Who Needs Who</i>, from polka to French chanson, Baltic billows to vaudevillian drama, but unlike with say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/636-beirut/"" target=""_blank"">Beirut</a>, the style never becomes the substance. Likewise, the drama behind the album's making doesn't overwhelm the music (even though a little more tension might behoove the lyrics), and if anything, it's likely steeled the band against future calamity. LaCount might wince a little when Invie sings, ""I'll never get tired of singing these songs"" on the gently defiant, cabaret-ish ""Meet in the Dark"", but few others will.</p></div>"|17123.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17123-who-needs-you/|7.4|Laura Snapes

Southern Lord's slow mutation into a hardcore label has drawn plenty of ire from doom purists, whilst winning the label scores of new admirers from beyond the wall of Sleep. It's definitely been trippy watching mainman Greg Anderson's interests shift from bottom-tuned drone to hateful black metal (Craft's <i>Fuck the Universe</i> is still a modern classic) and now towards the many shades of hardcore, be they blackened, encrusted, or straight-up Orange County beatdowns. Southern Lord's evolved from a one-trick pony into a horse of a different color, but if Anderson keeps cherry-picking talent like Seattle's blackened hardcore thrashers Black Breath, Converge tourmates Nails, and this review's protagonists, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5695-the-secret/"" target=""_blank"">the Secret</a>, then even the most dyed-in-the-denim doom heads will be forced to at least acknowledge that whether or not we're talking about Dead in the Dirt or Wild//Tribe five years from now, dude's got good taste.</p>
<p>While their third full-length and Southern Lord debut, <i>Solve et Coagula</i>, introduced them to American ears, the album got lost in the fray, dropping as it did amidst the first wave of Anderson's hardcore outpouring. Their little-mentioned metalcore past notwithstanding, it's apparent that the Secret have changed their tune quite a bit since their 2003 inception. Upping their negative approach has been nothing but beneficial, though.</p>
<p>Their fourth LP, entitled <i>Agnus Dei</i>, is fast, furious, and fucking hostile. The Italian four-piece comes charging straight out the gate like the hounds of hell are after them, and head straight for Golgotha. Their black metal influences set them apart from the majority of their labelmates, drawing a nifty little line between the past and present of Anderson's roster and repping hard for Team Satan while they're at it. Antireligious sentiment is no foreign concept to either black metal, death metal, grind, or crust punk, and it's satisfying to see that a band as invested in perfecting and perverting all four sounds is just as serious about doing the Devil's work.</p>
<p>Upon first listen, it all bleeds together, especially <i>Agnus Dei</i>'s seemingly interchangeable first half, but further investigation reveals a more dynamic showing. Most of the album is a straight shot, as a nonstop blazing tempo propels songs that segue into and out of one another with little warning or pause, swaddled in a thick, oppressive production and broken up by tracks like the blackly atmospheric ""Darkness I Became"" and dank, doomy ""Heretic Temple"". <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14413-post-mortem-nihil-est/"" target=""_blank"">""Post Mortem Nihil Est""</a> is when the record veers closest to straightforward black metal, and ""The Bottomless Pit"" is its most compelling slice of razor-edged, grinding hardcore punk. Album closer ""Seven Bllion Graves"" veers between savagery and silence at a punishing 13:33, closing out the proceedings on a devilish high note. <i>Agnus Dei</i>'s 13 songs hurtle by in under 45 minutes, an ideal length for a band like this; any more would have dragged, and any less would have teased. May god damn all of us, indeed.</p></div>"|17346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17346-agnus-dei/|7.4|Kim Kelly

(It also had a bagpipe solo.) But while ""The Battle of Hampton Roads"" and many other Titus Andronicus songs lack the structural qualities of punk rock proper, they more than compensate with a spirit of all-in commitment. This was music made without any sort of Plan B.</p>
<p>It's understandable that Stickles would be flying the banner of punk for <i>Local Business</i> since Titus Andronicus couldn't possibly top <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14010-the-monitor/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Monitor</i></a> by going bigger. But while <i>Local Business</i> is no less ambitious than its predecessors, it's ambitious in a way that's more meaningful for the band as a working unit. This is the first time the lineup touring the record is the same one that made it, and you get the feeling their intent was to make a one-take road dog album. At that they've succeeded. But <i>Local Business</i> also marks the first time the band seems like it's holding something back-- like there is a Plan B.</p>
<p>At the outset, you get an idea of how it might've been drawn up. The first three songs on <i>Local Business</i> are by far the strongest and perhaps coincidentally the most familiar-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45706-watch-titus-andronicus-play-two-new-songs/"">a medley of opening duo ""Ecce Homo"" and ""Still Life With Hot Deuce on Silver Platter""</a> has been a staple of their live sets for some time, while ""Upon Viewing Oregon's Landscape With the Flood of Detritus"" was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13320-upon-viewing-oregons-landscape-with-the-flood-of-detritus/"">premiered</a> as part of an anticipatory <a href=""http://titusandronicusllc.tumblr.com/post/19561316079/titus-andronicus-llc-mixtape-vol-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mixtape</a>. Together, they align with the mission of <i>Local Business</i> by sounding more plug-in-and-play than even the rawest parts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11202-the-airing-of-grievances/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Airing of Grievances</i></a>, something that could be knocked out immediately by five guys in a room and captured on tape without the need for narration, a brass section, or multiple tempo changes.</p>
<p>These opening tracks still bear many of the characteristics of classic Titus Andronicus songs, with rhythms to beat out on your steering wheel, triumphant classic rock guitars, and Stickles showing off his underrated sense of tunefulness. Once he grabs a hold of a melody, he crams it with in-jokes and self-reference: ""Feeling like we live on a Diarrhea Planet"" is a classic Stickles-ism if you don't know he's namedropping his <a href=""http://diarrheaplanet.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">friend's band</a>. In a rare event, Stickles actually repeats lines, and you can easily hear those key phrases being echoed by a room full of true believers. That sense of populism is crucial as the band juggles nihilism, existentialism, and misanthropy.</p>
<p>The opening section is a promising glimpse of a more aerodynamic and blue-collar Titus Andronicus, but by ""My Eating Disorder"", their new attitude has begun to clash with old habits. As is his style, <a href=""http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2012/02/9-musicians-discuss-chronic-illnesses.html?p=4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stickles has been candid about his struggles with Selective Eating Disorder</a>, and as a confessional, ""My Eating Disorder"" is admirable, enlightening, and incredibly brave. But as a piece of music, it doesn't pack nearly enough ideas to support its grand framework.</p>
<p>""My Eating Disorder"" isn't really part of a narrative arc, but as the literal and figurative center of <i>Local Business</i>, it opens a fissure and everything else crumbles around it. The one-minute instrumental ""Food Fight!"" and the one-line rant of ""Titus Andronicus vs. the Absurd Universe (3rd Round KO)"" are the type of songs that carried weight in the context of Titus' prior concepts, but here they add nothing. ""(I Am the) Electric Man"" was a lark when it was released online following Stickles' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44524-titus-andronicus-patrick-stickles-gets-electrocuted-disses-kurt-vile/"">bizarre electrocution accident</a>, and outfitted with glitzy showtune vocals, it's a welcome respite in between the autopilot angst of ""In a Small Body"" and ""Tried to Quit Smoking""'s agonizing blooze crawl.</p>
<p>Most important, for a record whose title and purpose is to celebrate punk, DIY, and local scenes, there's little sense of their previous fun or community uplift. During <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47890-new-titus-andronicus-in-a-big-city/"" target=""_blank"">""In a Big City""</a>, Stickles screams ""Now I'm a drop in deluge of hipsters,"" connecting with a sentiment on ""Still Life"": ""It's just me, lonely me/ and the other relevant dudes/ arrogant enough to believe this is developing news."" These are representative of <i>Local Business</i>' pervasive attitude, rife with the sort of sarcasm, gossip, and double meaning that dominates discourse in indie rock and its Twitter parallel universe.</p>
<p>Cynicism is both healthy and necessary in this realm, and Stickles' bullshit detector is off the charts throughout much of <i>Local Business</i>. But as he wonders about his complicity or how this kind of social schematic has benefited him, the album becomes stifling rather than illuminating. Even he's not sure how much he has to add to the conversation, as so much of <i>Local Business</i> struggles with coming up with something new to say: ""Don't tell me that I was born free/ that joke's been old since high school,"" ""By now I think we've established/ that everything is inherently worthless,"" ""Yes, it's 'us against them' again."" As such, a record meant to solidify Titus Andronicus after the past six years of personnel churn ultimately sounds transitional. This could possibly work in favor of <i>Local Business</i> in the long run, and after two stone-cold knockouts in <i>The Airing of Grievances</i> and <i>The Monitor</i>, it's not unexpected for them to stumble a bit. But are they on the right track? The battle lines of ""us against them"" aren't as clearly drawn this time, and for once, Titus Andronicus sound unsure of where they stand.</p></div>"|17258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17258-local-business/|7.0|Ian Cohen

Kepler's ""Harmony of the Worlds"" was the lead cut on a collection that held recordings of natural sounds, greetings in 55 languages, selections from Beethoven, Mozart, Blind Willie Johnson, and Chuck Berry, for the sake of demonstrating to other life forms in the galaxy that there is intelligent life on our planet. And now, Laurie Spiegel's music has traveled to the edge of <a href=""https://twitter.com/NASAVoyager2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our solar system</a>.</p>
<p>Back on Earth, the New York label <a href=""http://www.unseenworlds.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unseen Worlds</a> has obliged us with more Laurie Spiegel, reissuing her 1980 album, <i>The Expanding Universe</i>, and adding over 100 minutes of additional music. At a time when crucial female electronic composers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15828-pauline-oliveros/"">Pauline Oliveros</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30237-suzanne-ciani/"">Suzanne Ciani</a> are receiving new recognition for their work, Spiegel's music continues to resonate and often sounds strangely contemporary. That her work can be simultaneously dystopian and luminous speaks to Spiegel's talents. She can evoke the chilling cosmos while also crafting something small-scale and warm. When Voyager launched, President Jimmy Carter said: ""This is a present from a small, distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts, and our feelings."" His statement applies just as readily to <i>The Expanding Universe</i>.</p>
<p>Spiegel attended Julliard before researching at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, and at Connecticut's Electronic Music Laboratories on the nascent music systems being developed there. (Ultimately, she chose to pursue programming, forgoing musical composition altogether.) The notes within this reissue show the room-sized computers with which Spiegel concocted her music, and her anecdotes recall disk drives the size of washing machines preserving mere seconds of code. She offers details like: ""This 32k DDP understood FORTRAN IV and DAP II 24-bit assembly language. It could do an integer add in as little as 3.8 milliseconds but a floating point multiply could take up to 115.9 microseconds. You can bet we all wrote the tightest, smallest, fastest code we could.""</p>
<p>Whatever its heady origins, Spiegel's music is inviting, playful, and visceral. As she explained to The Wall Street Journal recently: ""There were all of these negative images of computers as giant machines that would take over the world and had no sense of anything warm and fuzzy or affectionate."" Yet ""Patchwork"" has the buoyancy of the ARP figure from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4592-the-who/"">the Who</a>'s ""Baba O'Riley"", ""Old Wave"" is woozy and syrup-slow, and a number of melodies anticipate the analog splendors of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29786-jurgen-muller/"">Jürgen Müller</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>. Her intellectual curiosity led her to investigate African and Indian polyrhythms-- which inform the throbbing and lively ""Drums""-- as well as the modal Celtic tunes she heard while studying American folk music in the Blue Ridge Mountains, which permeate three iterations of ""Appalachian Grove"".</p>
<p>Thrilling as these shorter studies might be, it's in her longer, more contemplative works that Spiegel's sensibilities become clearest. ""The Expanding Universe"" is nearly a half-hour of swelling, evolving tones, and she stresses that the composition is neither ""minimalist"" nor ""ambient,"" and that it exists wholly in its own space. Even if Spiegel's music weren't already launched into the firmament, it would finds its natural home there; it's when she contemplates orbits, heavenly bodies, and the cosmos through sound that her imagination is unparalleled. While Kepler mused that the ""Harmony of the Worlds"" would be audible only to the ear of God, what reaches human ears via Spiegel's realization is bracing, menacing, and disorienting, the piercing tones not unlike a choir of air raid sirens. An alien life form encountering it on Voyager's ""Golden Record"" would conclude that our world was a maddening, maniacal place.</p></div>"|17067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17067-the-expanding-universe/|8.5|Andy Beta

But it's a bit late!"" So said British singer-songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28682-ellie-goulding/"" target=""_blank"">Ellie Goulding</a> in <i><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/arts/music/ellie-goulding-on-her-new-album-halcyon-and-more.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The New York Times</a></i> earlier this month, after being told that her single ""Lights"" had become a hit in the States. It's taken two years-- years during which Goulding has been constantly, fervently touted as the next big UK breakout-- for the London pop star to catch a break on these shores. ""Lights"", a bonus track from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13995-lights/"" target=""_blank"">debut album</a> of the same name, follows a string of five not-quite-crossovers.</p>
<p>It's increasingly common for bonus tracks to become sleeper hits, thereby resuscitating albums and digging artists out of their midchart quagmires. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj</a>'s crossover was largely the doing of bonus track ""Super Bass"" from 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14898-pink-friday/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pink Friday</i></a>.) ""Lights"", co-written by Biff Stannard, who penned many a hit for the Spice Girls, was also issued as a single. That release came with the featherweight original, a wobbly Bassnectar remix, and a Fernando Garibay dance mix that sounded a lot like his last big project, Lady Gaga's <i>Born This Way.</i> All styles sounded perfectly plausible, and all received airplay. Radio-ready dance-pop? She'd be neither the first nor last to make that pivot. Dubstep? She likes it enough to hang with Skrillex, as anything written about Goulding in 2012 inevitably mentions. Polite folktronica? It worked for Beth Orton. Her po-faced cover of Elton John's ""Your Song""? It worked for, um, Birdy. Rebloggable covers of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28560-active-child/"" target=""_blank"">Active Child</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a>? Why the hell not?</p>
<p>The charitable interpretation of this is that Goulding's got a lot of ideas to play with. The cynical interpretation is that she's being opportunist, flinging herself into five potential genres in the hopes that one will take root. This isn't to say Ellie Goulding's music is anonymous. She has an instantly identifiable voice that can flip from soprano trills to scrappy yarls within a single verse, and she never sounds, like some of her peers, over-anxious to pass a BRIT School vocal jury. Sometimes she leaves her voice more or less alone, but more often she tweaks it, chops it up into snippets, loops it.</p>
<p>And so we've arrived at a place where Ellie Goulding has scored a Stateside hit, performed at Prince William's wedding reception <i>and</i> Barack Obama's Christmas-tree lighting ceremony, and has now dropped this perfectly timed album, <i>Halcyon</i>. She's calling <i>Halcyon</i> a breakup album in interviews, but the guy whose dumping really matters is Starsmith, who produced most of <i>Lights</i>. Apart from a few bonus tracks, he appears here just once, on the aptly titled ""Dead in the Water"". His best substitute here is Jim Eliot of Kish Mauve; he's no Stannard, but he's gone the rounds: stately dance for Kylie Minogue, angstful electro for Ladyhawke, assembly-line hits for ""Pop Idol"" winners.</p>
<p>""Anything Could Happen"" is essentially a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/"" target=""_blank"">Passion Pit</a> song without the emotional torment, from the stadium balcony-high synths down to the earnestness. (""After the war, we said we'd fight together/ I guess we thought that's just what humans do."") The claps and stomps and pleading of ""My Blood"" and ""Only You"" are clearly trying to emulate fellow Brit Adele, but if that experiment doesn't work, Goulding's got plenty of others. ""Figure 8"" and ""Hanging On"" are the pop-step songs, the ones that sound like they come from the same musical universe as Chase and Status. If those are too niche, a bonus track and likely single brings in Calvin Harris, sounding exactly like he always does.</p>
<p>These songs work better than the more traditional folk-leaning tracks, at least. Those underpinnings always existed beneath the club lights in Goulding's music, but mostly, her ballads are somnolent and give too much rein to her drippier lyrical impulses: ""I feel a lump in my throat, and this is far from joy,"" for example, or rhyming ""houses"" and ""rouses"" on the title track. She's better off when her voice and sonics take the forefront: the choral swells throughout the otherwise straightforward ""Explosions"", the way ""Don't Say a Word"" churns up drama around mostly repeated lyrics, or the whistle-register baubles strewn throughout ""Atlantis"". Goulding can certainly inhabit a soundscape. Her next step is to inhabit just one.</p></div>"|17171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17171-halcyon/|6.6|Katherine St. Asaph

Sure, her murmuring guitars and mellifluous vocals occasionally paint idyllic scenes-- ""Warm from the sun and cooled by the wind/ And the grass? Yeah, it sings to me,"" she proclaims on ""By the Lake"". But more often than not, the songs on the prolific Canadian songwriter's latest, <i>So Many Days</i>, feel like picnics under constant threat of capricious storms. ""Last Night I Lay in Bed"", a sing-songy, seemingly tender love song is suddenly undercut by the plainspoken confession, ""It scares me to think about losing you,"" delivered with a poignant shudder that elevates it far from the realm of cliché. Elsewhere, she momentarily cops a defiant swagger: ""Maybe the fighter, he don't need no one, and maybe the drinker, he don't need no one,"" but a few beats later, the whole song quiets to a hush as a thought moves over her as swiftly and opaquely as a dark cloud: ""Then again, maybe he does."" Doiron has always aimed to capture the kaleidoscopic emotional range of ordinary moments, and accordingly the moods of her songs often transform line by line. Out of this approach, she creates songs that move fluidly, moodily, unpredictably-- like life.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Doiron got her start playing with lo-fi New Brunswick noisemakers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1358-erics-trip/"" target=""_blank"">Eric's Trip</a> (the first Canadian band to sign to Sub Pop), and she began her solo career recording as Broken Girl until she outgrew the moniker. (""If somebody was introducing me,"" she recalled in a <a href=""http://cwas.hinah.com/interview/?id=84"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2002 interview</a>, ""It would be like, 'Now, put your hands together for Broken Girrrrl!' I'd just get on stage and feel devastated!"") The albums she's put out under her own name have all been as intimate and wholehearted as letters home: Accompanied by her guitar playing-- which is usually unhurried and gentle, but occasionally punctuated by gleeful explosions of the kind of noise she learned how to make in Eric's Trip-- her songs chronicle observations from the road, the ecstasies and anxieties of motherhood, and tumbles in and out of love. Continuing in this vein, <i>So Many Days </i>has an overall genial air that draws you in from its first track (the playfully galloping ""Cars and Trucks""), but it also contains some of the darkest and most harrowing material she's written since the days she was calling herself <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2407-broken-girl/"" target=""_blank"">Broken Girl</a>.</p>
<p>Doiron's songs are humble, perennially unadorned by aesthetic or lyrical pyrotechnics. The leisurely fingerpicked ""Another Second Chance"" begins, ""I'm not sure why this morning I'm feeling so blue,"" and sounds-- as a lot of Julie Doiron songs do-- like she just rolled out of bed, picked up a guitar, and decided to memorialize her first thoughts of the day in song. There are charms and limits to this kind of technique, but what <i>So Many Days</i>' 12 songs lack in compositional ambition or epic metaphors, they make up for in an emotional directness that is, in its best moments, absolutely piercing. On ""Homeless"", Doiron's weary vocals are accompanied by nothing but occasional, forlorn throbs of bass. ""I used to be good,"" she creaks, and then spins a tale of drinking, heartbreak, and abandonment; the straightforward lyrics feel that much more affecting in an atmosphere that sounds too barren for dreams. ""To all who love me,"" she sings, simply, ""I am sorry.""</p>
<p>Still, <i>So Many Days</i> isn't unremittingly bleak: tracks like ""Homeless"" and ""Another Second Chance"" are effectively balanced out by moments of unconditional warmth. The wooly guitars of ""Our Love"" conjure <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"" target=""_blank"">Yo La Tengo</a> (""Autumn Sweater"" hues with just a pinch of ""Sugarcube""'s dizzy dynamism), while the sparse ""Beneath the Leaves"" is a slice of pastoral beauty and affectingly rendered negative space. ""For now, no need to talk,"" she implores, ""Just listen to the sounds of life all around, forgetting us for now.""</p>
<p>""I'm writing this song to prove to myself that maybe I can write songs,"" Doiron confesses towards the middle of ""Cars and Trucks"", which might seem like an odd line coming from the mouth of somebody who has released about a dozen albums. But in the context of the song-- her voice suddenly hopeful, and the chords she's been plucking all along now springing along with new vigor-- it's a powerful moment, and one that finds Doiron, a decade and a half into her solo career, still finding new feelings to reveal and new pathways to let the listener in. ""I've been putting it off for all kinds of reasons, I've been afraid to try,"" she sings, but as the song gathers momentum, it's both exhilarating and triumphant, like we're hearing the song take shape in her brain, and the audible, match-ending thud of Doiron pinning her writer's block to the ground. If the moving and mercurial songs of <i>So Many Days</i> were the result, we have reason to be glad she won.</p></div>"|17221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17221-so-many-days/|7.4|Lindsay Zoladz

An electric guitar creeps into the mix, each note decaying between the patter. Putting down his horn, Bruce Lamont begins to paint an apocalyptic scene with his sterling baritone: ""The chaos is calmed/ The end has come/ Time begins anew."" He pauses for a moment to let the music gather beneath him. ""Uncertainty reigns,"" he continues. ""The new great awakening is here.""</p>
<p>If, after a decade of fomenting denim-clad metal against strains of fire-music jazz and Middle Eastern inclinations, Yakuza now need a tagline, ""uncertainty reigns"" might tell most of their story. A band in constant musical motion, Yakuza know no stylistic constraints; a minute after that credo is aired, for instance, the guitars crank in velocity and volume, chugging in NWOBHM time as Lamont takes the role of ranting street-level seer. It's unexpected and intriguing, a union that's long been Yakuza's standard. During the last decade, Yakuza have emerged as the byproduct of their own artistic crucible, the city of Chicago. By namedropping <a href=""http://prostheticrecords.com/?p=558"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tortoise as a touchstone</a>, recruiting <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YUuTTX14bI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">local improvisational stars</a> such as Hamid Drake or Ken Vandermark, and consistently recording with the producer that the <i>Chicago Reader</i> called <a href=""o/chicago-metal-sanford-parker-volume-recording/Content?oid=1541571"">""the man behind the metal""</a> in 2010, they've reflected their homestead's own variegated and deep musical strains. </p>
<p><i>Beyul</i>'s seven tracks offer studies in action verbs-- guitars shriek and saxophones writhe, drums flail and electronics screech, voices roar and rhythms slingshot. With Yakuza, all of these things happen in quick succession. The record's first 30 seconds bury a heavy saxophone theme between forever-rolling drums and a dense wash of distortion; when Lamont starts to sing, the guitar suddenly laser-etches above a rhythm section suited for classic black wax. Before the song ends, though, Yakuza sound alternately like Swans, Melvins, and Iron Maiden. The brilliant ""Man Is Machine"" crams a bustle of activity into nine minutes that delight both in and with unpredictability. What starts as a math-rock sprint switches into a snarled dirge, a trio of Chicago saxophonists (Lamont, session player Mars Williams, and Vandermark associate Dave Rempis) battling a suffocating guitar sustain. There are downshifts into doom, instant flips into technical sprints, and stops between the two that suggest the viscosity of stoner rock. Yakuza tracks tend to feel like a series of interconnecting catacombs, inlets, and outlets redirecting the flow just beneath the surface.    </p>
<p>Still, amid all the movement and complexity, what remains most remarkable about Yakuza is their obsequy to the idea of the song-- that is, if you're going to stick around for nine minutes of saxophone doom and resurgent thrash, you'd best leave with something to remember the time by. Though <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14100-the-last-day/"" target=""_blank"">""The Last Day""</a> eventually skips from moments of classic heavy-metal triumph to cello-assisted, chamber-ensemble elegance. Its first verse feels emphatic and enthusiastic enough to be a chorus; indeed, it's the theme that sticks around long after the song is done. ""Fire Temple and Beyond"" pivots on an unforgettable riff, ascending through repetition over a seesaw of bass. </p>
<p>That same balance of demand and relief seems to show in <i>Beyul</i>'s sequence. After a stand of monstrous tracks and ahead of a closer that drifts into an exultant coda, Yakuza add two relatively short and simple respites. ""Mouth of the Lion"" is as close to singles territory as the band has ever come, with the song's thrash insistence tempered by a radiant chorus. It's more urgent than Torche's recent output. Subsequently, ""Species"" sprints through 90 seconds of grindcore, its hurdling drums and hurling vocals clawing toward a quick exit. But notice the way a buzzing counter-riff runs atop everything in ""Species"" or the throat singing that echoes through the mix during ""Lion"". Even in simplicity, Yakuza thrive on complication.  </p>
<p>More so than previous Yakuza albums, <i>Beyul</i>'s twists will push some listeners away. The uncertainty that reigns in these songs sometimes pushes too far, detracting from a tune's core by putting too much distance between it and the end product. But that's Yakuza's abiding and most alluring gauntlet, too: <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/board/viewtopic.php?t=64985&amp;start=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rejected from Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> for not being metal enough and often ignored by the experimental music community for being too metal, Yakuza continue to forge a specialized and strange alloy on <i>Beyul</i>. Don't expect to love all of their recombinations. Do, however, expect to be surprised by them. </p></div>"|17337.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17337-beyul/|7.0|Grayson Currin

The album's cover art, a grubby Polaroid, provides a visual prompt for the scene: Baby <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick</a> dangles off an uncle's knee in front of a squat kitchen table displaying a 40-ounce and Lamar's baby bottle. The snapshot is such an unvarnished peek into the rapper's inner life that staring at it for too long feels almost invasive. This autobiographical intensity is the album's calling card. Listening to it feels like walking directly into Lamar's childhood home and, for the next hour, growing up alongside him. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Lamar has subtitled the record ""A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar"", and the comparison rings true: You could take the album's outline and build a set for a three-act play. It opens on a 17-year-old Kendrick ""with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental,"" driving his mother's van to see a girl named Sherane. As his voice darts and halts in a rhythm that mimics his over-eager commute, Lamar explores the furtiveness of young lust: ""It's deep-rooted, the music of being young and dumb,"" he raps. The song is interrupted by the first of several voice mail recordings that delineate the album's structure: Kendrick's mother, rambling into his phone and pleading for him to return her car. These voicemails appear through the record, reinforcing that <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i> is partly a love letter to the grounding power of family. In this album's world, family and faith are not abstract concepts: They are the fraying tethers holding Lamar back from the chasm of gang violence that threatens to consume him.</p>
<p class=""p1"">All this weighty material might make <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i> sound like a bit of a drag. But the miracle of this album is how it ties straightforward rap thrills-- dazzling lyrical virtuosity, slick quotables, pulverizing beats, star turns from guest rappers-- directly to its narrative. For example, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14459-backseat-freestyle/"" target=""_blank"">""Backseat Freestyle""</a> leaked last week, its uncharacteristic subject matter (""All my life I want money and power/ Respect my mind or die from lead shower"") took some fans by surprise. But on the album, it marks the moment in the narrative when young Kendrick's character first begins rapping, egged on by a friend who plugs in a beat CD. Framed this way, his ""damn, I got bitches"" chant gets turned inside out: This isn't an alpha male's boast. It's a pipsqueak's first pass at a chest-puff. It's also a monster of a radio-ready single, with Kendrick rapping in three voices (in double- and triple-time, no less) over an insane Hit-Boy beat.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lamar grew up in Compton, and ghosts of West Coast gangsta-rap haunt this album's edges, casting shadows on Kendrick's complicated relationship with his hometown. When ""The Art of Peer Pressure"" brings Kendrick and his friends to Rosecrans Ave., the music downshifts into menacing G-funk mode as a salute to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37wSwAJ98Zk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hallowed ground</a>. Ice Cube’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU8H9_YBM3A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Bird in the Hand”</a> is invoked to set up “m.A.A.d city” (“Fresh of out school, 'cause I was a high-school grad...""), which appropriately marks the moment when real violence erupts.<b></b> Here, Kendrick sounds like a terrified kid: ""I made a promise to see you bleeding,"" he raps, his voice pitched at a pleading, near-hysterical sob. In response, the voice of Compton's Most Wanted rapper MC Eiht leers, ""Wake yo' punk ass up,"" like a father figure of the Darth Vader variety.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Which brings us to the album's most visible benefactor and most unsettled presence: Dr. Dre. In recent months, Dre has availed himself of the fresh-career oxygen Kendrick's rise has pumped into his atmosphere, lumbering out of his corporate airlock to stand with Lamar on magazine covers. But the role he plays in Lamar's story feels muddled and unresolved. On an album that manages to seamlessly work a smirking Drake and a highly recognizable Janet Jackson sample (""Poetic Justice"") into the fabric of a larger narrative, it is only Dre's appearance, on the final track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48051-new-kendrick-lamar-featuring-dr-dre-compton/"" target=""_blank"">""Compton""</a>, that feels like an uneasy outlier.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""Compton"" is the victory lap, the coronation. Coming after the stunning 12-minute denouement ""Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst"", in which Lamar delivers a verse from a peripheral character that is the album's most dazzling stroke of empathy, it can't help but be a small deflation. The moment of arrival in any artist's story is always less interesting than their journey, and there's a disconnect in hearing Lamar and Dre stunt over Just Blaze's blaring orchestral-soul beat. Dre's music is part of the landscape that Kendrick grew up in but his actual appearance has a certain <i>Truman Show</i> feel to it.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But the <i>true</i> ending of <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i> takes place at the end of the previous song, ""Real"", which represents the spiritual victory that the album's story has thrashed its way towards. Finally grasping that ""none of that shit""-- money, power, respect, loving your block-- ""make me real,"" Lamar embraces what does, as his parents put the album's central concerns to bed: ""Any nigga can kill a man,"" his father admonishes. ""That don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family."" And his mother: ""If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man... Tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton... When you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement. And that's the best way to give back to your city. And I love you, Kendrick.""</p></div>"|17253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/|9.5|Jayson Greene

It's a curious thing: a vinyl-only release on Portland's Mississippi Records, which specializes in old blues and folk reissues. Limited to 2,000 copies, the album is sold exclusively through independent record stores and online retailers, although there are rumors of a digital release sometime in the future. Since it was announced earlier this year, we've had months to wonder what a Peter Buck solo album would sound like, but we've had 30 years to wonder what his singing voice sounds like: Seemingly content to stand off to the side while Michael Stipe and Mike Mills vocalize, Buck has let his guitar do the talking, and it's always had a large vocabulary and perfect elocution.</p>
<p>But how does he sound when he steps up to the mic? Low and gravelly and slightly narcotized, like he's calling in ransom demands. While nowhere near as agile or as commanding as his guitar, his voice proves unpredictable, as the growl grows trippy on ""Travel Without Arriving"" and as he barks out a string of expletives on the nightmare-exotica number ""It's Alright"". His final words on that song-- ""I tell you what, if that ain't music, nothin' is""-- form a strangely effective punchline, not to mention the closest thing this record has to a Big Statement. Anything can be musical, even Buck's odd, slightly unwieldy voice.</p>
<p>In fact, that instrument is perfect for the loose, lively, low-key vibe of this record.<i> Peter Buck</i> is Peter Buck testing the solo waters. That impression stems no doubt from his approach: Laid up in bed earlier in the year with a severe back injury, Buck found himself unable to play guitar, so he tried his hand at writing lyrics to pass the time. Vertical once more, he invited a bunch of friends into the studio to flesh out his songs, most notably Minus 5 frontman Scott McCaughey and Steve Wynn. They update some old blues tunes, even sampling Sonny Boy Williamson's infamously profane intro to ""Little Village"" for ""L.V.M.F."" A few wouldn't be out of place on a Minus 5 record, and others indulge some truly weird-ass studio hijinks. Not all of them work, but those that do possess a perverse pleasure. Opener ""10 Million BC"" sounds like someone drinking cough syrup and playing <i>Stoneage Romeos</i> on the wrong speed. ""Some Kind of Velvet Sunday Morning"", as its title suggests, is an attempt at a drowsy Hazlewoodsy epic, with Buck playing a strong Lee to Annalisa Tornfelt and Chloe Johnson's Nancy Sinatra.</p>
<p>Freed from the demands of notching a radio hit or selling however many units, Buck can simply chase one whim after another, with its surf rock or 60s bubblegum pop, R&amp;B, or C&amp;W. Perhaps that devil-may-care spirit is geographic in nature: The only other Georgian on the album is Mike Mills; everyone else is a Pacific Northwesterner, including Corin Tucker and Decemberist Jenny Conlee. It's Tucker who gets the best and most straight-faced song on the album, the defiantly despairing ""Nothing Means Nothing"", which may be the most personal and revealing song here.</p>
<p>Buck's obviously more comfortable as the sideman, but after decades spent backing Stipe, the task of accompanying a different set of pipes has obviously made him reconsider how he plays. In fact, this is the loosest, wildest, and most unguarded any member of R.E.M. has sounded in ages, maybe even since <i>Hindu Love Gods </i>or even <i>Dead Letter Office</i>. Like those two releases, <i>Peter Buck</i> is likely a fans-only effort, but one that showcases a low-stakes spontaneity and a renewed sense of possibility. Inauspicious by design, this debut is ultimately a minor contribution to the R.E.M. canon, but therein lies its chief appeal.</p></div>"|17344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17344-peter-buck/|6.8|Stephen M.

The Sudanese son of two college professors, he moved to the United States with his family at the age of five to escape the country's fomenting political violence of the late 1980s. The family moved around a bit, and Gallab eventually settled in Columbus, Ohio, when he was 18, where he fell in with the city's hardcore punk music community. He later found work as a session musician of some demand, drumming and serving as a multi-instrumentalist for Yeasayer, Caribou, Of Montreal, Born Ruffians, and Eleanor Friedberger. Eventually, as these things often go, he made his way to Brooklyn, where <a href=""http://sinkane.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sinkane</a> started taking shape as his primary creative outlet.</p>
<p><i>Mars </i>is Gallab's second full-length as Sinkane, and it sounds like the work of a nomadic professors' kid with equally strong ties to a DIY scene as well as his east African roots, whose creativity flourished on the road with indie vets and in the self-styled cosmopolitan home of 21st-century indie music. <i>Mars</i> is both refined and easygoing, if not a bit aloof at times. It works in multiple musical registers simultaneously and smartly-- the syncopated rhythms and breezy guitar figures of Sudanese pop, krautrock, early-70s funk, free jazz, <i>Fader</i>-friendly global indie-- while maintaining a clear authorial voice (largely coming from Gallab's playing multiple instruments on each song).</p>
<p>There's a loose concept at play on the record: Mars is Gallab's metaphor for a musical space in which anyone can exist, regardless of background. Though the temptation to refer to the rich tradition of Afro-futurism arises when a guy born in Sudan references interstellar reaches, the connection to Sun Ra, Parliament, or André 3000 is tentative at best. The record's politics are as abstract as the cover photo, and the album's mood thermostat doesn't move much from the ""chill"" position. There aren't a whole lot of lyrical specifics, but an abundance of references to the red planet seems less meant to signify escape (as in the Reverend A.W. Nix's pioneering <a href=""http://www.studio360.org/2008/dec/12/web-extra-the-white-flyer-to-heaven/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""White Flyer to Heaven""</a> sermon), or a sign of plain weirdness (as in Lil' Wayne's use): For Gallab, it's more along the lines of a summertime rooftop party, where your affable host greets you without rising from his deck chair.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, Gallab makes sure <i>Mars</i>' invitees are clearly identified. The album opens with the squawking funk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13251-runnin-runnin-daphni-mix/"" target=""_blank"">""Runnin'""</a>, on which his thin falsetto and encouraging words directly channel Blaxploitation-era Curtis Mayfield. ""Love Sick"" is about as blatant a reappropriation of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3buYpfYRlaA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Spoon""</a>'s vampiric funk riff as I've ever heard, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13020-jeeper-creeper/"" target=""_blank"">""Jeeper Creeper""</a> vamps for five minutes around the core idea of Yeasayer's ""2080"" (it helps that the band's bassist plays on the song). ""Making Time"", which rides a new age synth pad that could have been drawn from <i>All Hour Cymbals</i> into the pocket of a deep Afro-funk groove, is the album's most successful synthesis. He plays all instruments on the song, save for a ""Dirty Diana""-style guitar solo, courtesy of Twin Shadow's George Lewis, Jr. Yet instead of flaunting it, Gallab buries it in the mix, allowing it to serve as more of a textural element than a spotlit celebrity showcase. This is perhaps the clearest example of Gallabs gifts: using his friends smartly, playing down virtuosity, lest it detract from the overall vibe.</p></div>"|17218.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17218-mars/|7.0|Eric Harvey

Her records, which she releases under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29681-us-girls/"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Girls</a>, conjure a moment deep in the bleary-eyed hours of an overnight drive, when you've stumbled upon an eclectic radio program hosted by somebody too hypnotizingly weird to be trusted with a primetime slot. (If they belong in any David Lynch movie, it's <i>Lost Highway</i>, no doubt.) The plural noun in her moniker is Remy's droll idea of a joke; you can tell without peeking at the liner notes that this is a project born of solitude and isolation, a catalog of one person's varied enthusiasms. But Remy has a way of teasing out the common undercurrent in all her source material, creating a surprisingly cohesive sound out of no wave's corrosion, glam rock's hedonism, and pop's direct, gut-wrenching emotion. She's also got a gift for eerily infectious hooks: the melodies (on tracks like ""Island Song"", ""State House (It's a Man's World)"", and a deliciously creepy cover of ""The Boy Is Mine"") that bubbled up out of the smoggy ambience of her last and best record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16064-us-girls-on-kraak/"" target=""_blank""><i>U.S. Girls on Kraak</i></a> felt uncanny, imagined, too good to be true. You'd wake the other people in the car to listen, if only you were entirely sure you hadn't hallucinated them.</p>
<p>Despite her lo-fi leanings, Remy's music has always given off a warped glamor. But what makes <i>Gem</i> feel like a such step forward (and such a straight-up enjoyable romp) is the way it playfully appropriates the debauched excess of glam rock to achieve its own singular vibe. The terrific ""Slim Baby"" (an ode to co-producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19363-slim-twig/"" target=""_blank"">Slim Twig</a>, who makes records that share Remy's fascination with the theatrical) takes a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a>-worthy riff and a bleacher-stomping beat, but as ever, Remy finds a way to filter the familiar through her own idiosyncratic sensibility, slowing the tempo to just a hair below calisthenic. The result's an infectious and oddly sweet song (""My slim baby, won't you be just a little more close to me?"") that moves like a cheerleader on Quaaludes. But even when she's doing her best Bolan, <i>Gem</i>'s structure echoes no glam-related reference point more than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11730-here-come-the-warm-jets-taking-tiger-mountain-by-strategy-another-green-world-before-and-after-science/"" target=""_blank""><i>Here Come the Warm Jets</i></a>. It's uncannily early Eno in its attention to texture, love of affect and-- most of all-- its spirit of genre-hopping adventure. A sound collage of gurgling vocal samples preceded by an unexpectedly buoyant rendition of ""Down in the Boondocks""? Sure, says Remy, why the hell not?</p>
<p>On repeated listens, though, elements that initially scan as haphazard hodgepodge take the shape of something deliberate. With the ghosts of glam rock and pop crooners past as her guides, Remy's free to play around with different personas, characters, and genders. She dreams of being Jack the Ripper in a mesmerizing cover of Brock Robinson's ""Jack"", while ""Rosemary"" is a yearning, sea-sick elegy for the title character's affections. Her music doesn't gesture toward a deeper meaning below its surface so much as it glories in the weirdness, pleasure, and resonance on the surface of things. Which is how Remy's voice-- which sounds like Elvis' sneer caked in cherry red lipstick-- can be as simultaneously cartoonish and deeply affecting as it is on songs like ""Rosemary"" or her ode to her own project's isolated process, ""Work From Home"".</p>
<p>Perhaps just as much as she channels the theatrical androgyny of Bolan or crooner Billy Joe Royal, U.S. Girls makes me think of Cindy Sherman's photographs. They make similar inquires into identity, artifice, and the underbelly of glamor, and, like U.S. Girls, they conjure a state of being that seems like an ever-so-slightly off-kilter version of reality. ""Rather than being about understanding,"" Jerry Saltz  <a href=""http://nymag.com/fashion/12/spring/cindy-sherman-2012-2/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">wrote</span></a> in a review of the photographer's recent retrospective, ""[Sherman's pictures are] about coming to grips with the state of mind that produces them."" The same could be said of Meghan Remy's songs. You're tempted to call them Lynchian, but they're singular and personal enough to warrant their own adjective. Remyesque?</p></div>"|17222.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17222-gem/|7.7|Lindsay Zoladz

And that's Gaahl leading the book's same team up a snow-covered mountain to visit the home of his forefathers in the subsequent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnsgYvHPK8&amp;list=PL23EC8428CFA233FF&amp;index=5&amp;feature=plpp_video"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vice documentary</a> of the same name. The crew worried that the towering and reserved singer was leading them to their demise-- a somewhat reasonable concern, as he'd rather recently <a href=""http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=33256"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">been convicted of beating</a> an older man while telling him he intended to turn his figure into a human sacrifice. And a year before the sentence, Polish authorities nearly jailed ""the most evil man alive"" for a <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6t97j_gorgoroth-black-mass-krakow-2004-pa_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gorgoroth concert</a> that included butchered animal parts and nude women suspended from crosses. And yes, Gaahl is the first openly gay frontman of a black metal act. Memorable enough?</p>
<p>But neither Gaahl nor longtime bassist King ov Hell (his real name is Tom, if that makes you more comfortable) has been in Gorgoroth since late 2007. In fact, in 2009, the pair lost <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgoroth_name_dispute"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a big-deal lawsuit</a> to Infernus, Gorgoroth's founder, for the rights to the band and brand. God Seed-- Gaahl, King, and a minor-star team of two guitarists, a drummer, and electronics guru Geir Bratland-- is the result of that legal defeat. ""God Seed represents the will to grow, the will to be the super man so to speak,"" <a href=""http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=118577"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gaahl said of the somewhat laughable handle (and Gorgoroth song title) in 2009.</a> ""I think it's a suitable name for what we will represent in the future.""</p>
<p>Indeed, if growth is the goal, God Seed squarely accomplish the aim on their proper studio debut, <i>I Begin</i>. Apart from the controversies and stories you might have heard about Gaahl both in and out of corpse paint, he leads an expansive, able genuinely interesting retreatment of the primal stuff that made Gorgoroth matter here. Opener ""Awake"" rumbles open with true Norwegian ferocity, drums cascading by riffs written in miniature and projected in panoramic. But relentlessness isn't the chief asset or aim of God Seed, so ""Awake"" consistently zigs and zags, shifting tempos and temperaments enough to plow beyond any ensconced Gorgoroth rut. Organ solos intersect with electronic washes, and Gaahl-- never the most versatile man in metal-- shifts from a blood-curdling scream to a fist-pumping bark at will.</p>
<p>At least at the start, ""The Wound"" is as savage as anything its predecessor attempted during the last decade, but its circumspect nods to stoner metal and krautrock offer new gumption. During ""Alt Liv"", God Seed occasionally downshift into ritualistic throb, with Gaahl delivering sinister invocations alongside King ov Hell's throbbing bass. Though those segments sometimes border on Godsmack-style tribalism, they do position God Seed well outside of Second Wave confines. Closer ""Bloodline"" flirts with the same industrial deconstructions as Blut Aus Nord and Ben Frost, its melody and beat reflected and refracted by broken bits of sound. No, these three-to-five-minute tracks don't claim to be Enslaved epics or the philosophical revisions of some stateside black metal acts. But when Gaahl rasps in a near-whisper or when the keyboards lope with the esprit of a carnival ride during ""Aldrande Tre"", God Seed’s push beyond the comfortable becomes as exciting as it does obvious.</p>
<p>In many ways, God Seed emerge from an enviable and lamentable position: They possess a pedigree that, to many, makes them matter instantly-- and a strange, long face that makes them singularly recognizable. But quality control was never a Gorgoroth talking point, and some will be prone to dismiss God Seed simply because of Gaahl and King's tenure in that band. Gaahl's backstory and rather paradoxical views as a gay black metal bandleader who has both expressed support for fascists and seemed rather approachable give him a sort of freak-show status, too. But turning back just to the nine tracks of <i>I Begin</i>, God Seed sound like a native Norwegian act reinvigorated by these new circumstances. It would be a stretch to call <i>I Begin</i> a breakthrough for a fresh quinet; it would be dismissive to not consider it perhaps as the start of one.</p></div>"|17311.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17311-i-begin/|7.1|Grayson Currin

This is informative. Her father, a trainer for the Pakistani national squash team, left suddenly when she was 11, and his departure casts a shadow on the fairytale drama of Bat for Lashes' debut, 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9855-fur-gold/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fur and Gold</i></a>. Yeah, but one of the guys Khan's dad coached? Her cousin, Jahangir Khan? He went on to become a six-time world champion and basically his sport's equivalent of a Pelé or Michael Jordan. You don't need Natasha's Ancestry.com password to know there's competitive drive in her blood.</p>
<p>That's her up there in <i>The Haunted Man</i> cover art. Naked, un-retouched, and un-made-up, with a similarly naked man draped around her shoulders. The suggestion is that her follow-up to 2009's lavishly sensual <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12910-two-suns/"" target=""_blank""><i>Two Suns</i></a> is more intimate and stripped bare, and sure enough, there's less reverb on Khan's voice, and the lyrical concerns have moved from an otherworldly New York to the English countryside. But what the Ryan McGinley-shot art most closely shares with the music you'll find within is that it's at once striking and enigmatic-- and artfully constructed.</p>
<p>Some albums sound effortless. <i>The Haunted Man</i> sounds like effort magnificently realized. The rawness of feeling is achieved through equally raw ambition. Bat for Lashes' sophisticated blend of art-rock grandeur and synth-pop directness again carries echoes of 1980s luminaries like Kate Bush and the Cure, gleaming with autoharp, Abbey Road-recorded strings, and a continuing exploration of electronics. Spacious, boldly orchestrated, and emotionally rich, Khan's latest is another step forward for the multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter, and one of the year's most beguiling albums.</p>
<p><i>Two Suns</i>' sublime, <i>Karate Kid</i>-nodding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11161-daniel/"" target=""_blank"">""Daniel""</a> won Britain's Ivor Novello songwriting award. The potential hits here are just as overpowering. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11928-lets-get-lost/"" target=""_blank"">""Let's Get Lost""</a>, the sumptuous slab of goth-bubblegum Khan did with Beck for 2011's <i>Twilight: Eclipse </i>OST, was a promising sign of what to expect. On slinky, guitar-centric <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47895-listen-bat-for-lashes-all-your-gold/"" target=""_blank"">""All Your Gold""</a>, Khan is the one who's haunted, but it only takes a few listens before Gotye's awfully similar smash sounds fleshless in comparison. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14228-marilyn/"" target=""_blank"">Marilyn""</a> adapts the 1950s matinee-idolatry of Lana Del Rey to a dream-pop production worthy of its ""silver screen,"" with a staggering, spectral bridge-- and several instrumental contributions from Beck (plus arranging by ex-Ash member Charlotte Hatherley).</p>
<p><span><span>Though sometimes over-reaching, the less likely singles here are as darkly enigmatic, sonically curious, and thematically textured as their equivalents on <i>Two Suns</i>. </span></span>The centerpiece is the title track, with its ""Scarborough Fair""-tinged male choir marching up that distant hill. ""Yes, your ghosts have got me, too/ But it's me and you,"" Khan replies, summing up the album's main conceit: the way previous experiences can twist our current relationships. On M83-gauzy, Dave Sitek-assisted opener ""Lilies"", though, ""the figure of a man"" answers a life-affirming, womanly prayer. Druid-like male voices on ""Oh Yeah"" introduce the poised yet passionate exultation of a narrator ""in bloom."" As on the album cover, Khan's music can acknowledge the female body without reducing it to sex-kitten cliché.</p>
<p>In fact, if the last album was about contrasts-- between two suns, two lovers, even two sides of the narrator's persona-- then <i>The Haunted Man</i> is defined by balance, between the bare and the polished, between the communal and the personal, and between the respective ghosts haunting our personal interactions. Compromises can lead to breakthroughs: ""Where you see a wall, I see a door,"" Khan sings on ""A Wall"", another Sitek-backed, baroque synth-pop anthem. By the restrained yet intricate closing lullaby ""Deep Sea Diver"", which meets the bar set by <i>Two Suns</i>' collaborative finale with famously reclusive crooner Scott Walker, Khan finds a compromise for two people separated by masks: ""Darling if you can't see out/ You know that I can hear you shout."" They're together, alone, shaking through.</p>
<p>The most overtly naked track here, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13918-laura/"" target=""_blank"">""Laura""</a>, is also the most transcendent. With a gently orchestra-kissed piano-and-voice arrangement, this goosebump-inducing collaboration with the former Lizzy Grant's ""Video Games"" co-writer Justin Parker is the clearest example of how Bat for Lashes perches on the fulcrum between indie-associated sincerity and pop-oriented savvy. We'll never know Laura, really, but we can feel what it might be like to know her. On an album with more names in the credits than Khan could ever use for song titles (also including Portishead's Adrian Utley, among many others), the greatest testament to her strength of will might be just this: She has added a new unforgettable character to pop's family tree.</p></div>"|17174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17174-the-haunted-man/|8.4|Marc Hogan

Last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15050-blue-songs/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blue Songs </i></a>offered streamlined, moody, and frequently muted dance-pop, studiously treading the disco/house tightrope in the service of a higher cause of emotional, songwriterly dance-pop. By contrast, Butler's entry in the <i>DJ-Kicks</i> series pledges itself openly and unabashedly to debauched, dancefloor-centric old house music, in all its sped-up, chunky and percussive glory.</p>
<p>But haven't we been here before, on countless DJ mixes from an endless succession of eclectic, strip-mining DJs who've trod these spangled boards over the past decade or so? Well, yes. And it's less a problem of the well running dry-- the supply of half-forgotten dance classics and would-be-classics for DJs like Butler to liberate seems inexhaustible-- than of maintaining the shock of the new-old. Like a well-crafted TV show whose later seasons are doomed to repeat in mildly new constellations the same storylines and relationship dynamics, disco and early house revivalism has reached the stage where, even if the tracks aren't familiar, the music's <i>character arc</i> certainly is: the now-faded futurism, the bloated sonic excess, the sudden U-turns from deeper-than-deep obscurantism to unabashed populism, the single-minded splendor of the disco and carnality of the house. It's a vibe that the Glimmers had already conquered seven years ago, and Playgroup's Trevor Jackson more than 10. </p>
<p>At first, <i>DJ-Kicks </i>seems destined, even content, to offer another pitch-perfect parade of retro dance-pop signifiers. This approach is typified by Hercules and Love Affairs' own stately ""Release Me"", whose tumbling Chicago house piano, chattering percussion, grainy orchestral synth hits, and smooth Bananarama vocals seem to hit every retro dance-pop button simultaneously. Their formal stylistic diversity notwithstanding, early inclusions such as the primitive, overstuffed UK house of Rhythm Mode:D's ""Can You Feel It (Reach to the Top)"" and the by turns stern and silly new beat of Fax Yourself's ""Strut Your Techno Stuff"" simply entrench the emergent collage: scenes from a dozen great parties from the late-80s/early-90s interzone-- though, of course, it's not immediately apparent what would be wrong with such a thing.</p>
<p>But there's a broader and more interesting idea being promulgated here that doesn't become clear until the disc's middle third, which alights on a winning streak of bumping New York garage (Klubb Kidz's ""Don't Want to Hurt You (Skool Flava Dub)""; the Solution's ""Feels So Right""; Cloud 9's ""Do You Want Me""), peaking with DJ Duke's darkly stuttering ""Love Don't Come Easy (Power Dub)"", which deploys a series of fractured diva invocations over a mysterious bassline and deliberately rudimentary, flailing snares. Much more than on his own productions, Butler's mix leans hard (and progressively harder) into 90s house's clattering counter-rhythms, the skipping snares and bustling hi-hats and general sense of so-wrong-it's-right rhythmic awkwardness that becomes less about the cheerful exhumation of retro signifiers and more about the <i>science </i>of dancing-- a concern that feels modern regardless of the timestamp on the music that gives voice to it.</p>
<p>In its final stretch <i>DJ-Kicks </i>pursues this target with less regard to questions of old versus new. In the contemporary corner, Haze Factory's ""A Bit of Redemption"" fashions a jaunty tango strut out of a mordant techno synth melody, while In Flagranti's ""Magojiro"" concocts a fluttering and disorienting boogie, like a caffeine-wired update of Cultural Vibe's ""Ma Foom Bey"". But more fully modern than both is Jump ""Chico"" Slamm's confounding, intoxicating ""second wave"" Chicago obscurity ""Feel Free"" from 1993, all relentless machine loops, bustling house syncopation, and effete, sighing vocals-- familiar ingredients combined in a manner that renders them utterly alien.</p>
<p>While it's always startling to stumble across a 20-year-old tune that still sounds totally fresh, I can't help but feel it would be even more exciting if ""Feel Free"" was new, a signpost of where we might go next rather than a snapshot of a path not travelled. Still, in its focus on the past's knack for concocting rhythms that dance around (rather than to) the beat, <i>DJ-Kicks </i>makes a decent case for retracing our steps. If Butler falls slightly short of convincing that this particular brand of old will be made new again, it remains hard to find fault with his survey of all the fun we could have had.</p></div>"|17223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17223-dj-kicks/|7.0|Tim Finney

Despite their relatively high profile with false-metal media outfits, though, grindcore titans <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheRealPigDestroyer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pig Destroyer</a> have ferociously exempted themselves from any crossover discussion, all without doing much more than being themselves. The reasons why that kind of resoluteness would keep them outliers should be obvious if you know what ""grindcore"" means. If not, the first four tracks of <i>Book Burner</i> are a pretty good crash course: You shouldn't need more than four minutes to figure out if this band is for you.</p>
<p>During those four minutes, we get saturation-sprayed by the kind of rasping scream that will keep some future ear-nose-and-throat specialist in cushy golfing weekends. Frontman J.R. Hayes has one of the best and most convincing lunatic <i>presences</i> in metal. Even if he's a pussycat in his home life, when he's psycho-raving on record he turns into the guy on the subway you hope would move along to the next car. Presence is important for outsiders when dealing with a genre where some of the biggest stars ""sing"" like a troubled digestive tract. Pig Destroyer have loads of it thanks to Hayes, a desperation and rage they manage to communicate like actual desperate and angry humans, rather than relying on played-out metal scariness.</p>
<p>Now given those running times, the tempo on those four opening statements is obviously set at ""insane,"" and only occasionally notched down to ""mosh,"" with new, presumably non-cyborg, drummer Adam Jarvis doing stop-on-a-dime swerves and shifts that only programming should be able to pull off. It's Jarvis' first record with Pig Destroyer, and he wastes no time in introducing himself to the fold: The third track, ""The Underground Man"", which lasts all of 32 seconds, is just awesome, a senses-battering overload that manages to both swing and clobber. It's as if Jarvis, who also plays in the deathgrind band Misery Index, took about six hardcore songs he'd been tinkering with, all of them at different speeds, and then decided, hey, why not just slam them all together without once losing the groove. When it's over you feel like you just staggered off a broken tilt-a-whirl.</p>
<p>Maybe you should give it to track five though, because that's when guitarist and band mastermind Scott Hull unleashes the first of many sick-ass riffs that any lover of heavy guitar could understand, a woozy swamp-muck strut that could quite plausibly be called anthemic. Hull's own affinity for perverse grooves is another reason for Pig Destroyer's improbable sense of swing between the full-frontal assaults. Despite their commitment to total destruction, PD's guitar <i>does</i> offer a ton of familiar pleasures, little blurts of fierce thrash or low-down Southern boogie, with the few seconds of righteous evil that close out ""Eve"" being both typical and exemplary. It's just that we really are often talking literal <i>seconds</i> to grab onto. And though he clearly invested many childhood hours studying metal's unholy texts, Hull's just as interested in making sounds like a swarm of killer bees squeezed into your ear via a turkey baster. So yeah, this is still music with zero intention of meeting the non-extreme audience halfway.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Book Burner</i> is Pig Destroyer's fifth album, and despite a five-year gap since their last record, the epochal <i>Phantom Limb</i>, and the addition of a new drummer, it's the work of a long-haul, tour-honed grindcore unit in frightening control of its caustic materials and even more caustic philosophy. Like a Hollywood stunt choreographer let loose on a demolition derby, Pig Destroyer attacks these minute-and-change bursts of chaos with dominating precision. Even when they ride out a groove, like riff-monster ""Baltimore Strangler"", it's more like breaking a bad horse than enjoying a friendly gallop. Plus, the title alone should let you know the kind of blasted emotional world we're inhabiting here. Think one of those max-out-the-credit-cards underground horror films made by and for obsessives: <i>Book Burner</i> is utterly ugly, thoroughly alienating stuff that doesn't give half a shit if you can stomach its musical and spiritual violence.</p>
<p>It's also one of the best rock albums of the year, though maybe it should come with a sticker that reads ""abandon hope of rockin' good times, all ye who enter here."" And Pig Destroyer even have qualities to please those who go to metal for its ""avant"" qualities as much as the abuse. If even the most room-clearing metal can get praised for its sonic adventurousness in our texture-obsessed times, for a grindcore band-- extreme metal often at its furthest-out extreme of rawness and ragged production-- Pig Destroyer have an incredibly <i>rich</i> sound. The addition of noise dude Blake Harrison for the last couple of records has given the music an extra horrible-blare layer of gnarled electronics. And despite the band's famed lack of bass guitar, the weight of Hull's typically low-end-intensive production job reattaches the <i>heaviness</i> to a genre where too often the pursuit of speed leaves everything tinny and weirdly weak.</p>
<p>The one thing that's hard to deny is that <i>Book Burne</i>r's even less user-friendly than <i>Phantom Limb</i>, which wasn't exactly a freindly how-do. It's like PD decided to take the innovations of<i> Limb</i>-- the massive and unashamed riffage, the body-bruising weight-- and apply it to the chewed-and-chopped frenzy of their first few, more traditionally grind LPs. One thing for sure though is that PD continue to play with an invention and intensity that sucks the breath out of fans, a dedication to both grind's visceral appeal and shaping it into new forms that puts them leagues beyond most of their peers. It's that raging conviction, the totalizing <i>whomp</i> of their sound, one you can feel in your gut as much as hear, that makes them powerful, above and beyond however much their sense of rock groove and rock drama nudges their genre's self-imposed boundaries forward.</p>
<p>So PD put this crazed and hateful stuff together with as much smarts as any high-brow metal band, but also with an end-of-their-rope furty that's more <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J8I9XgwfmU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jake LaMotta punching prison walls</a> than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR-luBHDPfc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Petrucci doing Rimsky-Korsakov-for-idiots</a>. There's a queasy joy you feel in your lizard brain with heavy music played with PD's can't-be-faked physical force. Their aggression seeps into you like an unwanted, but eventually not-unpleasant sickness. Maybe that's not your bag. It's not a lot of people's bag. But if it is, <i>Book Burner</i> is seriously cathartic. However convoluted things get, you still wanna pump fist and bang head, even if you're not always sure when you should be doing so.</p></div>"|17255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17255-book-burner/|8.0|Jess Harvell

Its boldly titled opener, ""Hot Song"", begins with a hard blast of test-tone drone, then adds a pounding metal-can beat. This attention-getting salvo feels like a statement of purpose, and indeed what follows is just as brash and urgent-- a muscular, locked-in brand of noise-rock that guitarist/bassist Sarah Register and drummer Andrya Ambro quickly turned into a signature.</p>
<p><i>Sunshine</i>, the pair's follow-up to <i>Sugarland</i>,<i> </i>starts with less of a bang-- opener ""Lone General"" announces itself with a fizzle of feedback and a subdued drum roll. But once Register's chopping chords coax aggression from Ambro's percussion, and the pair trade war cries (""Fa-fa-fire now!,"" ""Ch-ch-charge boys!""), it's clear Talk Normal's intensity hasn't subsided. If anything, <i>Sunshine </i>cranks things up a notch. <i>Sugarland</i>'s peaks might have reached higher, but the churning, relentless <i>Sunshine </i>keeps me pinned to the edge of my seat longer.</p>
<p>That's especially impressive given that none of the album's nine songs are especially fast, loud, or climactic. Eschewing easy crescendos and flashy turns, Talk Normal build tension strictly from momentum. Register and Ambro persistently dole out rigorous beats, sheets of guitar, and woven singing until what began as a orderly march feels like headlong rush. Think of <i>Sunshine</i> as a post-punk workout: The point isn't how much sonic weight the pair can lift, but how many reps they can do. And quite often the hard work pays off in a kind of musical runner's high.</p>
<p>That workout feel extends into <i>Sunshine</i>'s lyrics, which come off as cheers or chants, as if Register and Ambro are pushing each other to surpass personal bests. The words are often plain, sometimes even blank or banal. But there's a kinetic force to Talk Normal's call-and-response repetition that gives a weight beyond meaning. So when Register stutters, ""hell no,"" during the title track, or Ambro scolds, ""Chew your food 30 times/ Eat and die and pay on time,"" in ""Hot Water Burns"", their delivery makes you reconsider what those colloquialisms mean. It helps that the words rhyme with the sounds, filling in rhythms and dotting lines with staccato. Take ""XO"", which is all energy and motion, with blurts of ""bye bye bye"" and ""love love love"" catching fire with Ambro's inclining beat.</p>
<p>Inclines, weight, energy-- all these adjectives suggest that <i>Sunshine </i>can be exhausting. And it can, but in the way stretching muscles and sweating buckets helps clear your mind and rid you of toxins. Not every song holds an epiphany-- some are just easily enjoyable, like the slow-swinging <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13858-bad-date/"" target=""_blank"">""Bad Date""</a> or the grunge-like ""Shot This Time""-- but the potential's always there. On the album's standout, ""Baby, Your Heart's Too Big"", potential and actual fuse, simultaneously offering something to latch onto and look forward to. ""Your heart's too big, his arms too long, your minds too bright, our pulse so strong,"" sings Register, nicely capturing the way <i>Sunshine</i> turns simple words and sounds into something larger.</p></div>"|17224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17224-sunshine/|7.7|Marc Masters

As the wildly prolific <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"" target=""_blank"">Prurient</a>, Fernow sometimes pushed harsh noise to dangerous and defiant extremes; at other times, he webbed static through a tangled haze of broken drums, haunting screams, and oddly romantic pleas. Each new release felt like a surprise to be unwrapped and examined, so over time, I've obtained as many as possible. Of course, if that were the limit of his output, the quest would be much easier: In the black metal melee Ash Pool, the brazen dance band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"" target=""_blank"">Cold Cave</a>, the crackled-and-crass noise of Exploring Jezebel, and a dozen other short-lived and incredibly named projects, Fernow has issued a veritable flood of music during the last 15 years. At this point, gathering all the pieces seems patently impossible. And that's not even taking into account his long-running multimedia and multi-format imprint Hospital Productions or his latest venture, the new label Bed of Nails. </p>
<p>So far, at least, Bed of Nails has been easy to trace. When the label launched in June, after all, its first release was a four-song EP from Fernow's latest solo guise, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30495-vatican-shadow/"" target=""_blank"">Vatican Shadow</a>. Under that name for the last two years, Fernow has manipulated images and tropes of military tragedy (his first proper LP featured a photo of Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan on its cover) with an interest in dimly lit, tangent-prone techno. His best work yet under the name comprises <i>Ornamented Walls</i>, the project's debut effort for Manchester-based imprint Modern Love. Like notable labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"" target=""_blank"">Demdike Stare</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Stott</a>, Vatican Shadow's music could be vaguely categorized as eerie electronica. The beats are never direct or obvious; rather, they bounce around in halls of broken sounds, with samples and static and squall surrounding them in bursts of activity. <i></i></p>
<p><i>Ornamented Walls</i> isn't an LP so much as a collection of material you might have missed and an addendum of tracks you don't want to miss. The 23-minute A-side is actually a reissue of an earlier digital EP built from live rehearsals for ""Operation Neptune Spear"", the code name of sorts for Vatican Shadow's live premiere in Los Angeles in May. (If discography-obsessive detail is your thing, Fernow also released two such tracks at the show itself, in a cassette run limited to 17.) The second half, though, combines six tracks recorded shortly thereafter but not yet released. The pieces on both sides plunder the same sonic premise-- beats tumbling through claustrophobic nightmares, arriving at one punishing terminus or another. </p>
<p>But it's telling that Fernow fits twice as many tracks onto the B-side in roughly the same amount of time. During the A-side's rehearsal workouts, Fernow is processing digital samples through a cassette system and manipulating them again on the other side. There's a sidewinding sense of indeterminacy here, then, where a theme appears and sometimes quickly vanishes for good, the precipitate of a restless mind and process. ""Operation Neptune Spear Part 2"", for instance, creeps through subterranean bass and a lazy, long drum sample until, without notice, Fernow splices in the sound of a Jordanian man singing. It soon fades away, replaced by a blown-out sequence of beats and bass that seem salvaged from an all-night rave. </p>
<p>For the B-side, though, he works one idea over until reaching a definite and logical end, whether that takes eight minutes or only one. The backside's first and longest piece, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13715-cairo-is-a-haunted-city/"" target=""_blank"">""Cairo Is a Haunted City (Mythic Chords)""</a>, builds steadily, with several strands of drone (alternately harsh, soft, damaged, and warm) wrapping slowly around a militaristic march; think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a> rerouting their typical ascendance through urban muck. The relatively brief ""India Has Just Tested a Nuclear Device"" unfurls as a lulling invocation, with war drums softly rattling alongside shooting stars of faded electronics. Closer ""Boxes Were Wired to Batteries Then Loaded Into a Brown Toyota Cargo Truck"" shifts the action to the sampled drums. The already broken rhythm trips over itself every so often, eventually tumbling toward an oblivion of repetition as the gauze of noise beneath vanishes. If Side A is open-ended exploration and Side B is closed-system execution, <i>Ornamented Walls</i> is provocative manifestation of the same unresolved and unlimited approach that Fernow has used throughout his career. </p>
<p>Both for its use of jarring imagery and subverted symbols and its unfailing willingness to nest one genre's sounds within another's modes, Dominick Fernow's body of work is a study in implicit transgression. In the heyday of Prurient, for instance, he'd dismiss claims that the project was the result of his interests in black metal; this was about noise and electronica, not about pissed bros in corpse paint. And now, although Vatican Shadows depends upon traditional electronic elements (or the dismantling thereof) like beats and keyboards and samples, the various pushes and pulls of his other experiences are exactly what make <i>Ornamented Walls</i> so intriguing. Listen for the creep and sudden punishment of black metal at the back half of ""Operation Neptune Spear Part 1"", or the relentless insistence of power electronics during ""Yemeni Telephone Number"": <i>Ornamented Walls</i> is not only an enticing new entry for Vatican Shadow but also a continuation of the overwhelming oeuvre that preceded it.</p></div>"|17322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17322-ornamented-walls/|7.4|Grayson Currin

There was some music shelved and some routine image trouble, but she scrabbled her way back to square two with the help of more professionals: Dev Hynes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange/"" target=""_blank"">Blood Orange</a> and Shirley Manson of recently revived <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1682-garbage/"" target=""_blank"">Garbage</a>. Now her protostar is brighter than ever and she's earned one of the biggest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14138-everything-is-embarrassing/"">cult hits of the year</a>. On her new EP, <i>Ghost</i>, she's settled into several mutually exclusive styles of music. It's official: she's the year's next big latent potential. </p>
<p>None of this is entirely fair to Ferreira. It says a lot about both her talent and tenacity that she's even managed this much of a comeback when every major label and producer has a basement cluttered with the discarded half-debuts and dozens of demos that never even made it that far. It helps that she's got connections from before and during her industry time, and that they're easily spun into anecdotes (her mentor, <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/11010080"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael Jackson</a>! Her partner in vodka-bottle scandal, <a href=""http://earsucker.com/2010/katy-perry-posts-racy-sky-ferreira-photo/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Katy Perry</a>!). It helps that all those singles, hits or not, gave her residual name recognition. It helps that she shows candor about it, <a href=""https://twitter.com/skyferreira"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on Twitter</a> and to tastemakers. It helps that she's got her alt-fashion and modeling gigs-- ever more necessary as industry demands layer multi-platform experience and brand support on artists like tiered skirts. And it helps most of all that Ferreira's spent the years since her debut cultivating an impeccable, or at least impeccably marketable, sense of taste. She's called her upcoming album more of a <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2012/06/interview-sky-ferreira-talks-red-lips-terry-richardson-socialite/page/3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collection</a> of that taste than a statement of an album. And though she's spoken <a href=""http://rookiemag.com/2012/02/sky-ferreira/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">elsewhere</a> about how developing artists aren't encouraged to curate those collections as often as inherit them from someone else's drawer, everything on <i>Ghost</i> sounds like something Ferreira does genuinely like.</p>
<p>What Ferreira likes, it seems, adds up to a veritable nostalgia feed. ""Lost in My Bedroom"" burbles over with details, sounding as if Ferreira's actually lost in about 10 synthpop songs playing at once, three of which came from John Hughes movies and two of which are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11884-dancing-on-my-own/"" target=""_blank"">""Dancing on My Own""</a>. Her voice disappears into the mix as if she's disappearing into a one-girl, mattress-jumping dance party, and as soundtracks to those go, this is as gleeful as any. Earlier on, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/574-jon-brion/"" target=""_blank"">Jon Brion</a> assists with ""Sad Dream"", which flitters from the mundane (""I hear your call and I let my phone ring.../ I listen to the stereo play"") to the mythologizing (""I live by my own laws, I stick to my guns""), from calypso to folk, from the warbled vocals of certain Brion acolytes to the more petulant, wailing sort. It never quite lands on a chorus, but it never quite needs to; the hesitation fits the subject matter. The same can't be said, alas, of ""Ghost"", Ferreira's alt-country track. The songwriting's evocative enough, and Ferreira emotes with enough stirrings of yearnings, but they sound more aspirational than heartbroken. She's crying out for someone, but not as loudly as the track cries out for its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2045-emmylou-harris/"" target=""_blank"">Emmylou Harris</a>. </p>
<p>Nobody's asking Ferreira to be an alt-country singer, though. She fares better and sounds far more comfortable on tracks like the Manson-penned ""Red Lips"". It's essentially a Garbage B-side shorn of a pre-chorus, and it wears its concept as brightly as its colors, but Ferreira sells it with a distant, almost tossed-off vocal. There's distance in Hynes' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14138-everything-is-embarrassing/"" target=""_blank"">""Everything Is Embarrassing""</a>, too, but a different sort. Where ""Red Lips"" is haughty, this is sullen; where Ferreira snarls out the former's chorus, ""Embarrassing"" sees her really dancing on her own, her melody too plaintive, her vocals too understated, and the beats too hazy to register much beyond resignation. It's not a come-on, as some have written, nor is it the anthem it's clearly trying to become (and that the inexplicable overproduction on the <i>Ghost </i>re-recording seems to try to make it).

Anyone who approaches the material looking for insight into his condition may end up reading too much into the lyrics and possibly missing the point of this modest release.</p>
<p>This mini-album accompanies the book <i>From Blacksheep Boys to Bill Collectors</i>, which includes artwork by William Schaff and writing from Will Sheff, John Darnielle, and Darren Jackson (the songs are also available for separate digital download). Published by the Savannah-based Graveface Records, it's an intriguing mix of the musical and the visual, especially since Schaff and Molina both emphasize the handmade and the homespun in their individual media. Written for the project when it was devised several years ago, the songs have the feel of woodcuts, stitched samplers, shadow boxes, and rough pencil sketches. Much less elaborate than Schaff's creations, they're essentially demos, capturing ideas and moments with no regard for crisp fidelity. The click of the recorder is audible after most songs, and a roomy hiss pervades opener ""Heart My Heart"" and ""A Sad Hard Change"", creating an eerie sustain for his strums and evoking another presence there in the room with him. Perhaps it's the ""my love"" he addresses on ""Shore to Shore"". ""The ocean, my love, was not enough,"" he sings. ""The nightingale rose but her soul could not.""</p>
<p>It's unclear whether this demo sound is the result Molina intended or simply one step toward fleshing them out with Magnolia Electric Co. or some sympathetic collaborator, but it does lend the collection a cohesive quality similar to 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9336-let-me-go-let-me-go-let-me-go/"">Let Me Go Let Me Go Let Me Go</a>. </i>Molina sounds good in this setting, his voice well suited to the creaky intimacy. He sings like he's telling old secrets, with a sharp shiver in his notes, and the mood is that specific Molina flavor of somber that ties all of his records together. With only eight songs running 22 minutes, <i>Autumn Bird Songs </i>is a slight collection-- a 10"" rather than an LP-- and yet there's something compelling about that slightness, which echoes Molina's preoccupation in ghosts and spirits.</p>
<p>He peppers these lyrics with familiar references to hauntings, plains, highways, and wings-- all emblems of big ideas about travel and rootlessness, turmoil and security. In other words, <i>Autumn Bird Songs</i> continues a detailed emotional cartography he began 16 years ago with Songs:Ohia. While it may work best as a complement to Schaff's artwork-- or, more fittingly, as an addendum to Magnolia Electric Co.'s 2007 box set, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10516-sojourner/""><i>Sojourner</i></a>-- this release underscores the enormity of Molina's absence these past few years, as well as the promise of his return.</p></div>"|17266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17266-autumn-bird-songs/|7.1|Stephen M.

But with his work on career-defining albums by 3rd Bass, Big Daddy Kane, Queen Latifah, and especially <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1028-de-la-soul/"" target=""_blank"">De La Soul</a>, he demolished established ideas of what rap beats were and could be, radically broadening the form's sonic horizons with collages of samples lifted from psychedelic pop bands, obscure jazz outfits, kids' records, and anything else he could get his hands on. In the process he laid down a foundation that producers from the Bomb Squad to Kanye and beyond have built upon, and helped considerably to further the argument that hip-hop deserves to be considered an art form every bit as much as rock does. </p>
<p>That aesthetic daring is what's earned Paul a permanent spot in the hip-hop history books, but he's also responsible for another innovation that's become deeply woven into the form's fabric, although to a much more ambivalent response from listeners: the rap record skit, wherein the musicians take a break from making music to show off their comedic talents, engage in ersatz phone sex, or threaten their competitors more directly than they can in song. The hip-hop skit has gotten a lot of bad press over the years, mostly because a lot of rappers are way less entertaining when they're not rapping, but ever since De La's 1989 <i>3 Feet High and Rising</i>, Paul's been working to elevate it to an art form.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact beginning with mid-career high points like 1999's <i>A Prince Among Thieves</i> and <i>So…How's Your Girl?</i> (the former a solo album and the latter a collaboration with fellow producer Dan the Automator under the name Handsome Boy Modeling School) his skits have been just as important a part of his records as the ambitious music surrounding them. Paul uses his skits to tie together the individual songs into concept albums ranging in subject matter from the vicissitudes of a career in the music business to extended riffs on references to an obscure and long-canceled sitcom, and to help make the whole far more entertaining than a concept album deserves to be.</p>
<p><i>Negroes on Ice</i> may be the apotheosis of Paul's skit-centric approach to making albums. Creating alongside his son P. Forreal-- a DJ, MC, and beat maker in his own right-- music makes up just half of the album by track listing, and just over half of its run time. The rest of the record is given over to an epic spoken word story by P. Forreal that begins with him waking up next to his girl and ends almost an hour later, having in the meantime traversed the length and breadth of New York City being pursued by the police and a gang of Jamaicans, driven a Scion xB Scarface (""the rapper"") edition through a gay pride parade, won a speedwalking race, eaten a dolphin, punched several dozen people (including his best friend, a few cops, and a dead helicopter pilot), and encountered Pusha T, Akon, Jimmie ""J.J."" Walker, Steven Seagal, and a busload of other celebs and semi-celebs, before (spoiler alert) robbing a bank and flying to Africa to work in the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant. It's something like <i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i> reimagined by a young pop-culture-obsessed rap fan buzzing off a junk food binge.</p>
<p>In a flip on the usual format, it's the songs on <i>Negroes</i> that serve as interludes to the skits. Putting together a skit-free version of the album in an iTunes playlist means missing out such LOL-worthy episodes as P. Forreal boatjacking a highly customized amphibian vehicle from Yung Joc, but it's a solid collection of music nonetheless. For someone with such a long and prolific career, Prince Paul has yet to release an out-and-out clunker, and although he's in his mid-40s his music still exudes the same enthusiastic energy as the material from nearly two decades ago. The beat to ""Pixel Hero"" is built around a nasty polyphonic keyboard riff and the kind of breezily funky drums that Paul helped to introduce to hip-hop, while the drum programming on ""I'm a G"" nods to the double-time rhythms of today's pop-rap even as a dizzily catchy piano line goofs off on top of it.</p>
<p>And while at this point P. Forreal is a slightly more accomplished storyteller than he is a rapper-- I bet he'd be a great standup-- he and a cast of little-known rappers like Breeze Brewin, T. Harris, and Soce the Elemental Wizard all deliver solid performances laced with a casual, slightly surreal sense of humor that pairs perfectly with the beats, and flows that indicate they've spent some serious time studying the Native Tongues scene Prince Paul was once part of. And if the ridiculously clever text-speak flow on ""Textual Healing"" is any indication, P. Forreal could easily establish a career independent of his pops.</p>
<p class=""p2""><i>Negroes on Ice</i> is a funny record, but it's also a sneaky one. It bills itself as a goofy father-son collaboration with a bunch of no-name MCs in tow, and doesn't even note on its track listing the guest voice over appearances by Ice-T and Chris Rock, who could probably double the sales of the record by himself if it did. In fact it seems to do everything it can to come off like a throwaway album, which you might think it is up until the point where you find yourself hitting play on it over and over again.</p></div>"|17197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17197-negroes-on-ice/|6.5|Miles Raymer

Doesn't that just make all the sense in the world? After a few failed dalliances with a couple of the indie world's heavier hitters-- two for Matador, one for Merge-- Ohio lo-fi distorto-poppers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5176-times-new-viking/"" target=""_blank"">Times New Viking</a> have returned to Siltbreeze, the Philly-based fuzz-peddlers behind the band's first couple of LPs, <i>Dig Yourself</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10019-present-the-paisley-reich/"" target=""_blank""><i>Present the Paisley Reich</i></a>. Not that they've changed all that much in their time apart;  sure, 2011's fitfully satisfying, comparatively scrubbed-sounding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15357-dancer-equired/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dancer Equired</i></a> was a stark reminder how well all that grime has served them through the years, but those Matador LPs had all the grisly vitality of anything that came before them. Still, even at Matador, the fit wasn't ever quite right, a problem of expectation more than output; this is a band with a song called ""Try Harder"" that seemed to sneer at the very concept of effort, and even at their catchiest, they've never been an easy sell. It's not Interscope or anything, but when you're a band on Matador or Merge, you've gotta move a few units. On Siltbreeze-- sometime-home to Harry Pussy, Psychedelic Horseshit, and the Thomas Jefferson Slave Apartments-- though? Pressure's pretty much off.</p>
<p>And <i>Over &amp; Over</i> finds Times New Viking sounding like a band with nothing left to prove. The six song, just-under-14-minute <i>Over &amp; Over</i> doesn't give itself a lot of time to fuck around. But fuck around it does, blasting through a few tunes worthy of the best-of and a couple of scraps they could've left on the basement floor. ""Middle Class Drags"" is the winner here, a brash, immediate power-popper that belongs in the same breath as past triumphs like ""Devo &amp; Wine"" or ""Move to California"". Beth Murphy and Adam Elliott's vocals seem to be punching Jared Phillips' guitar square in the face, but the bordering-on-triumphant hook at its center blasts through the din the way a Harley peels out of a church paking lot, a perfect balance of song and snarl. For all its stray slack (""falling further behind and still sleep in,"" they prescribe), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14390-sleep-in/"" target=""_blank"">""Sleep-In""</a> has plenty going for it, and in it, too: The accidentally-on-purpose hook's effortless enough, but everything else-- rollicking keyboards, caterwauling guitars-- fall all over themselves, a pile of ankles and elbows in the form of a song.</p>
<p>""Y2K2"" pulls back the rubber band as far as it'll go, but they never quite let it snap; by the end, the tension from all that built-up skronk gets stuck in the back of your neck. Sweet relief: ""Future With Girls"" is all whiplash. With its half-dozen tempo changes, a truly nauseous organ line, and a false ending or two, its all-over-the-place construction seems to mirror the push and shove of the shitty relationship half-described therein, but it's just more song than two lousy minutes could ever hope to contain. Still, it's impressive how tidily <i>Over &amp; Over</i> goes in righting most of the wrongs of <i>Dancer</i>, considering how untidy it is. There's an underlying warmth to songs like ""Telephone Wires"" and closer ""At the Bars"" that seems to've carried over from that LP, but unlike the comparatively staid <i>Dancer</i> songs, <i>Over &amp; Over</i>'s not afraid to get weird.</p>
<p><i>Over &amp; Over</i> keeps its stakes on the manageable side, short, and loose, and profoundly uninterested in any kind of statement-making. But that whiff of modesty, coupled with their return to a label better suited to their ambitions, is sort of a statement in and of itself. You're either in or out with Times New Viking; they're too obstinate, too sadistic, the smart-dumb shit they talk in their lyrics too obtuse (and obscured by static) to not trying most people's patience. Which means they're far better off making slight but satisfying records like <i>Over &amp; Over</i> for few obsessives than they are trying to figure out how the hell to get their uncompromising music over to a bigger crowd. For another band, <i>Over &amp; Over</i>'s outright refusal to go for the gusto might represent a kind of defeat. For these guys, it feels like a sorely needed restart. Let those other bands chase their audiences; if you need Times New Viking, you know where to find them.</p></div>"|17184.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17184-over-over/|6.9|Paul Thompson

Now, they're ready to take on the rest of the British isles: <i>Furniture</i> handily displaces the loopy 60s-psychedelic and 70s-glam influences of their debut for a bright 80s New Pop sheen and the skyscraping grandeur that defined mid-90s Britpop. But the shift is philosophical as music as it is sonic: Where <i>Goodbye Falkenburg</i> spoke of love and courtship in cheeky, suggestive language, <i>Furniture</i>-- in the arch, observational tradition of ABC and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3414-pulp/"" target=""_blank"">Pulp</a>-- uses its sleek sophistication not just to gloss over the straight-faced tales of emotional woe described within, but as an analogue to the procedural, commoditized nature of modern romance.</p>
<p>On the opening title track, frontman Meilyr Jones sounds the death knell for a failing relationship by declaring, ""We are furniture."" By that token, listening to <i>Furniture</i> feels not unlike flipping through an IKEA catalog-- it's easy to get lured in by the pretty surfaces and marvel at the inventiveness at play but, after a while, a certain sterility starts to take hold. At least Race Horses ease you into the album's more despairing worldview-- from the outset, the band is game to play up the knowing contrast between what's being said and how they're saying it. The aforementioned chorus of ""we are furniture"" is delivered less as an insult than a cathartic first step toward post-break-up liberation, while on the winsome ""Mates"", Jones begs an ex to revert to the platonic terms of their pre-hook-up friendship. And in lieu of a new post-reunion Pulp album, we have ""Sisters"", which vividly evokes both the breezy, pop-romantique flair of <i>His N Hers</i> and Jarvis Cocker's voyeuristic, borderline-pervy intimations.</p>
<p>But while it's inevitable that a young band brimming with manic energy will buckle up and simmer down, on <i>Furniture</i>, Race Horses' rapid maturation can feel a little jarring: The synth-speckled piano march ""Nobody's Son"" boasts the kind of instantly anthemic chorus that could spark a football stadium full of cigarette lighters, but it's also the most incongruous track here, as it sacrifices the band's peculiar personality for arena-rock proficiency. And their attempts to get serious yield mixed results: While ""Bad Blood"" successfully channels its anxieties through an intensifying, start-stop structure and ticking synthetic cymbal effect, the equally agitated ""My Year Abroad"" and ""See No Green"" are bogged down by overwrought, repetitive choruses. So it's fitting that this transitory album, preoccupied as it is with romantic upheaval, should close with an somber, affecting piano ballad titled ""Old and New"", with an extended one-chord outro that effectively conjures the titular state of purgatory, and the difficulty of letting go and moving on. It's a sentiment that applies equally to <i>Furniture</i>'s emotionally stagnant protagonists as to Race Horses themselves-- it's better to attempt great strides and risk stumbling than to get left in the dust.</p></div>"|17284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17284-furniture/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Glass' most identifiable music is simple, or so it seems: Play a chord, break it down into its constituent notes, and repeat the notes in hypnotic succession. If there's another instrument playing, they're probably playing the same notes in a different order. At the foundation of the music, there's what's called an ostinato. One way to think of it is as a bassline; another, in the words of a clever Wikipedia contributor, is a riff. When his music changes, it changes subtly and methodically: One note in the sequence altered here, another there. Over the course of a few minutes it can change completely, but there's no one point where you can mark the change as having taken place. It's hard to think of a Glass composition that doesn't work this way. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNiOqa1nWgI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">At least one man with an electric piano has posited it as an almost scientific truth</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, Glass did with live musicians what a lot of techno and electronic-music producers ended up doing with sequencers, samplers, and other mechanical ways of ordering sound. Like techno, his music operates on the simple principle that if you've been seeing zeros flashing on a screen minute after minute, seeing a one will seem very dramatic. This, again, comes back to repetition: Unless our environment stays the same for a little while, there's no way we'll be able to perceive difference. If Glass' music is romantic, it's the kind of cool, godlike romance of watching ants in an ant farm, or streams of pedestrians from the window of an office building: the romance of distance, of pattern, of busy movement made to look transparent and organized.</p>
<p>At some point in the past year, Glass approached Beck about putting together a group of artists to remix his music. In a quote that mirrors the deceptive clarity of his music, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/magazine/philip-glass-and-beck-discuss-collaborating-on-rework.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told the <i>New York Times</i></a>, ""I'm interested in what happens to music when other people use it. Whereas there are composers who don't like anyone to touch their music, I think people should because they do things I can't think of."" Beck obliged, and now we have <i>Rework</i>.</p>
<p>Some of the source material here will be familiar even to passing Glass fans. Cornelius, for example, works with the opening section of 1982's <i>Glassworks</i> (which in Glass' own words was intended to get his music across to ""a more general audience""), while glitchy L.A. producer Nosaj Thing uses parts of ""Knee 1"", the opening section of the recently revived opera <i>Einstein on the Beach</i>-- probably Glass' most famous piece of music.</p>
<p>Of course, whether or not the music is familiar doesn't matter as much as what the interpreters do with it. It's easy to imagine how this could have gone badly. (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3y_Fay4SBQ&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PL28FC18A72DB2D1D6"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In fact, some intrepid people on the internet have already tested out just how badly it could have gone.</a>) Glass' innovations have percolated so far through the world of contemporary music that a lot of the contributors here-- Tyondai Braxton, Dan Deacon, Cornelius, and Pantha du Prince-- can, as Pitchfork contributor Brian Howe put it, remix him and still end up sounding more or less like themselves. As a result, a lot of what's here doesn't really demonstrate what they can do to Philip Glass, but what Philip Glass has already done to them. </p>
<p>Would it surprise you to learn that Beck's contribution-- a 21-minute collage called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14412-73-78-beck-remix/"">""NYC: 73-78,""</a>-- is disorientingly, almost astonishingly good? Maybe. Probably. How or why this is the case is unclear. I doubt even the staunchest <i>Modern Guilt</i> defenders would say that the records he made after the millenium were better than the records he made before it. (Ironically, the turning point was <i>Sea Change</i>.)</p>
<p>Like its title suggests, ""73-78"" feels like a long period of time collapsed into a single, dreamlike space. Beck's voice drifts in and out like a melancholic choirboy over whole series of passages spanning Glass' career, from full-band compositions to solo piano ones; from the churning, machinistic side of his sound to the spare, meditative one. There is some drum machine, and then there isn't. Glass has always been identified as a New York City composer, and his music has always articulated big-city feelings with uncanny elegance: the loneliness of them, the grandeur of them, the lonely grandeur of them; their violence and their comfort, their threats and seductions; the way they can feel incomprehensibly big and claustrophobically small.</p>
<p>Beck repeats the same line in different parts of the piece: ""I was living in a wasteland, dominated by these maniacs."" The words-- wasteland, maniacs-- are violent, but his delivery is gentle. This is what time does: It takes a fact and softens it. It heals. By the piece's restful end, it almost feels like a survivor's diary: the sound of someone going in and coming out, changed.</p>
<p>I refer back to that Glass quote, about the possibilty of another artist taking his music and doing something with it that he would've never thought of. ""73-78"" doesn't feel like Philip Glass-- it's too drifty and unbound. It's something completely different. It's also leagues beyond what anyone would reasonably expect from a project like this. The rest isn't.</p></div>"|16745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16745-glasscuts-philip-glass-remixed/|6.5|Mike Powell

An album of strictly Christmas fare, it is the work of Cee Lo the entertainer, a brand extension of his pop-persona witnessed every week on ""The Voice"", America's best worstmazing singing competition show, where he is a coach/judge. If you were hoping for Cee Lo bringing in Big Gipp and putting the Dungeon Family treatment to ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", you best look elsewhere for that freaky yuletide.</p>
<p>That is not to say that <i>Magic Moment</i> isn't a pleasure to listen to. It is! <i>Especially</i> if you are fond of Christmas standards and loud singing. As Green said of himself recently, ""No one does soul like Cee Lo Green."" It's true. No one else on contemporary pop radio carries the torch for true soul singing and vintage R&amp;B hooks like he does. On<i> Magic Moment</i>, Green does a lot of broad-strokes Motown updates (""White Christmas""); the triumphant production, a locomotive backbeat paired with sleigh bells, is a veritable tribute to Phil Spector's classic 1963 holiday comp <i>A Christmas Gift For You From Phil Spector.</i> </p>
<p>It would seem that <i>Magic Moment</i> is the work of pop-savvy Green gunning for the kind of hits that a regular album of his would not provide. There is something here for everyone, or perhaps rather, every standardized radio format; if Green is gunning for holiday omniscience from now until the end of Christmas, he has plotted a sure and failproof course with <i>Magic Moment</i>. There is the playful jazz shuffle-cum-melismatic exercise of ""Baby It's Cold Outside"", featuring Christina Aguilera, the heavy Christian mojo of ""Mary, Did You Know?"". The <i>avec</i> Rod Stewart ""Merry Christmas, Baby"", its airlessness cementing a hallowed space on Lite FM from now until the sun swallows the Earth. <i>Magic Moment</i>'s most curious collaboration is with the Muppets on his original, ""All I Need Is Love"", which is built on a sample of their beloved ""Mahna Mahna"".</p>
<p>Green's singing here is not his most nuanced; he's singing at the middle-low end of his range, not in his trademark reedy voice. There is a lot of loud, full-bore belting. It's a little showboaty and on occasion his voice threatens to overpower the song itself (""Silent Night"")-- perhaps a bit of pandering for ""Voice"" viewers who only know him from the show, which is a cavalcade of over-the-top, soulful shouting. Still, not a note of <i>Magic Moment</i> rings false. Green sounds like he really has been waiting all year to trap unsuspecting people under the mistletoe; clawing his presents open like a wolverine. He's so motherfucking cheery he makes Burl Ives seem like Michael Gira. </p>
<p>Still, it's the album's melancholy moment that is its most magic-- Green's faithful rendering of Joni Mitchell's ""River"", from her 1971 folk masterpiece, <i>Blue.</i> It's barely a Christmas song, a rueful break-up ode that cribs a bit of ""Jingle Bells"". He trades the original's piano for a Wurlitzer and matches Mitchell's mournful alto; a rare moment of restraint that illuminates the span of Green's talent. Coming a mere three songs after a jubilant-bordering-on-spastic version of ""Run Rudolph Run"", it feels like a bit of a hat tip, reminding us that despite all this Christmas ham, the closet freak is still in there somewhere.</p></div>"|17250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17250-cee-los-magic-moment/|5.9|Jessica Hopper

On the title track of 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13037-yours-truly-the-commuter/""><i>Yours Truly, the Commuter</i></a>, he claims he was left for dead: ""I could give two shits about what they said/ I may be limping, but I'm coming home."" At the time it sounded like he was still bristling over the breakup of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1773-grandaddy/"" target=""_blank"">Grandaddy</a>, the Modesto-based band that soundtracked Lytle's weird tales of space miners and lovelorn robots. The lines were vague enough, however, that you could appreciate the renewed sense of mission without getting caught up in any potential intraband politics. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13956-dept-of-disappearance/"" target=""_blank"">""Department of Disappearance""</a>, which likewise opens and sets the tone for an album of the same name, Lytle explains, ""I'll crawl into the mountains, I'll fall into obscurity/ A phantom on the landscape, a memory of what used to be."" Is this an ultimatum of some sort? And is the titular institution really a secret society of veteran musicians from the 1990s, still tooling around years after their breakthrough albums and playing to dwindling audiences of aging fans? If <i>Yours Truly</i> announced Lytle's return, <i>Department of Disappearance</i> sounds like a musician embracing obscurity as perhaps the natural outcome of a career whose chief subject has been emotional, mechanical, and ecological entropy.</p>
<p>There's nothing worse than an artist waxing bitter about his career, and to his credit Lytle doesn't sound self-pitying or entitled to more than his current lot. But <i>Department of Disappearance</i> does sound strangely complacent and monochromatic, offering no twists on the technorganic aesthetic he's been plying since Grandaddy were still a bedroom act. The album toggles between the mountains of Europe and the badlands of the American West, as Lytle indulges a bit of emotional mountaineering on ""Last Problem of the Alps"" and ""Matterhorn"". Geographically, this is new terrain for him, but musically Lytle is walking in his own footprints. He's climbed similar hills before, both with Grandaddy and as a solo artist. Once again he fashions widescreen panoramas out of instruments seemingly ill suited for the job: chintzy synths evoking Bierstadt landscapes, grotty guitars tracing the country's inexorable westward progress, saccharine strings coloring in complex feelings.</p>
<p>This is, of course, Lytle's thing. And it's a good thing. He's done what few artists possess the vision or the tools to accomplish: He has devised a new combination of styles and instruments into a sound that is immediately recognizable as Lytleputian, and perhaps more impressively he has fashioned a unique perspective from which to write about himself and the world-- specifically America in all its mythic strangeness. Last year's reissue of Grandaddy's second album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15723-the-sophtware-slump/""><i>The Sophtware Slump</i></a>, reminded us how vibrant and weird that voice could be, and <i>Department of Disappearance</i> has the distinct disadvantage of following up that release, which provides an unflattering point of comparison for familiar, almost boilerplate songs like ""Somewhere There's a Someone"" and ""Hangtown"". If once he imagined a new world defined by millennial fears and technological detritus, on ""Willow Wand Willow Wand"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14323-get-up-and-go/"" target=""_blank"">""Get Up and Go""</a> the naivety sounds forced, the sense of whimsy merely workmanlike.</p>
<p>For every valley, however, there is a peak. ""Young Saints"" sets an uneasy tone with its creeping vocal melody, disembodied drums, and dark intimations of mortality: ""Your ex-girlfriends, lost pets, and dead friends,"" he sings in his trademark deadpan. ""No, they won't be hanging out with you again. You are gone!"" It's intense and disquieting, yet it's the one song where Lytle sounds most present, with no character, robotic or otherwise, to absorb or soften those fears of absence. Similarly bleak, ""Your Final Setting Sun""-- which was, according to Lytle, inspired by Cormac McCarthy-- recounts a killer's final taunts to a dying man: ""I know you loved your life, but say goodbye, this is your final setting sun."" Has Lytle ever sounded so cold-blooded? So musically malevolent or so emotionally hardened? As the drums barely keep pace with the frantic keyboard themes, his vocals take on a menacing quality that we've never heard from him before and that quite frankly I didn't dream he could muster: It's a bracing moment and completely unexpected, both the album's biggest risk and its biggest reward.</p>
<p>Then <i>Department </i>veers into the valedictory closer ""Gimme Click Gimme Grid"", and we're back on sadly familiar ground. This is exactly the type of mock-epic album closer that Lytle does almost too well. Think ""So You'll Aim Toward the Sky"" off <i>Sophtware Slump</i> or ""The Final Push to the Sum"" off <i>Sumday</i>. But it sounds absolutely anticlimactic sequenced after ""Your Final Setting Sun"", which suggests a much more inventive and exciting artist than we get throughout most of the album. That song says more about Lytle's career than any veiled lyric could: If he can't push himself in new directions, he'll be stuck at his desk job, pushing paper for the Department of Disappearance forever.</p></div>"|17178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17178-dept-of-disappearance/|5.9|Stephen M.

The genre's basic elements are well-represented: The sludgy erosion over the guitars, the drums blasting with machine-grade heaviness. Since the old formula goes ""one part metal, two parts punk, and one part psychedelic weird shit,"" it's not a stretch by any means to consider Naomi Punk a grunge band. And while they're clearly a part of a long lineage of bands taking their influence from the Seattle rock scene of the early 1990s, Naomi Punk's songs are not cheaply manufactured recreations of Soundgarden or even TAD.</p>
<p><i>The Feeling</i>, originally released on vinyl and now being issued by Captured Tracks digitally and on CD, captures the trio studying the grunge rulebook just to tear it in half. Naomi Punk's approach to grunge is one of deconstruction and rebuilding in different places with fewer parts. Most of the album's songs change tempos at the drop of flannel, breaking into a dense wall of meticulously controlled chaos. Guitars are not delivered with a steady stream of chords; they come in blasts along with the crash cymbal, often at irregular points in the song. There's almost a need to keep up with them rhythmically over the first few listens, because the phrasing of the chords and beats zig zag through a motley course, unintentionally using empty space as every bit the weapon their guitars and drums are.</p>
<p>Despite the grunge signifiers, Naomi Punk seem to be working under a template like slowcore, art-punk, or no wave played at half-speed. They've given themselves a narrow palette to work with in this sense, but <i>The Feeling</i>'s funeral-march tempos and unrelenting heaviness don't detract from what makes the album compelling. Aside from three quasi-classical guitar interludes, the record comes packed top-to-bottom with total bruisers, and for most of its 35 minutes, the music is hitting you with pummeling force, every bit as visceral as your favorite punk album from this year. Most of the songs come with a cathartic breakdown of some sort, whether it's the rollicking finish of ""Trashworld"" or the chorus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14294-burned-body/"" target=""_blank"">""Burned Body""</a>.</p>
<p>Not only does <i>The Feeling</i> connect on a purely visceral level, it's got plenty of emotional resolve. For a band whose poppiest song's titled ""Burned Body"" and for all of the lyrics about charred flesh and self-immolation, Naomi Punk are good at injecting a bit of hope and optimism into their music. ""I am the sun/ I am the shooting star"" goes the opening lyric of ""The Spell"".</p>
<p>The title track takes that optimism and shoots it into anthemic territory. Playing out like the battle scene climax of your favorite war movie, ""The Feeling"" starts out scaling back to hold the tension, but rolls into explosion after explosion. The chorus, the sedate tease of the middle eight, and then the climax-- ""And now I know that I can find a way""-- triumphantly rise above the din. Monolithic and seemingly impenetrable at first,<i> The Feeling</i> has a number of these moments, subtler details that offer plenty of rewards for whoever can stand being pummeled for almost 40 minutes.</p></div>"|17248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17248-the-feeling/|7.6|Martin Douglas

Rose alleged in a <a href=""http://www.vice.com/read/how-the-producer-of-the-weeknds-breakout-tracks-got-majorly-screwed"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Vice</i> interview</a> that he was responsible not only for the druggy, dreamy blueprint that defined the project's sonic identity, but that he also came up with the louche condo-rat persona that singer Abel Tesfaye adopted when he took the Weeknd name. Rose was credited on the trio of songs posted to YouTube that first drew attention to the Weeknd when Drake reposted them, but although two of his compositions made it onto Tesfaye's career-launching debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15264-house-of-balloons/"" target=""_blank""><i>House of Balloons</i></a>, his name didn't appear anywhere on or around the finished album.</p>
<p>Tesfaye's kept typically silent about the accusations. Rose, on the other hand, has made a few follow-up comments that indicate he's happy to leave behind his situation's dramatic aspects in order to enjoy the perks of his post-Weeknd notoriety, namely the attention being paid to his first solo recordings, a five-song EP for fellow Canadian beat maker Jacques Greene's Vase label.</p>
<p>Given Rose's claims of ownership to the Weeknd's trademark sound and mood, it's close to impossible to listen to <i>Zodiac</i> without holding it up against the 70% of <i>House of Balloons</i> that he didn't have a hand in, as well as its two sequels, all of which were arranged by credited producers Doc McKinney and Illangelo. It's a tantalizing prospect made frustrating by <i>Zodiac</i>'s brevity-- just under 18 minutes-- compared to the 2.5 hours worth of material that Tesfaye, Illangelo, and McKinney released in 2011. Still, there's enough material to make a few comparisons.</p>
<p>For instance, Rose is a much less disciplined and proficient musician than Tesfaye's current favored producers. This isn't a bad thing, and Rose has admitted in his interviews that he isn't an adept player. Illangelo and McKinney may have the better grasp on pop song structures, but their heavily mannered Weeknd productions can sometimes get stiflingly stylish, whereas Rose's lack of technical knowledge means he doesn't even know which lines he's supposed to be coloring in. That element pays off in the same kind of wild, throw-anything-at-the-wall energy that you find in early recordings by Brian Eno, who at the time didn't really know what he was doing either.</p>
<p>The EP starts off with Rose backing up his claim on the Weeknd's trademark sound and mood on a pair of songs, ""Girlgirlgirl"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47608-listen-to-a-track-from-alleged-former-weeknd-producer-jeremy-rose-aka-zodiac/"" target=""_blank"">""Come""</a>, that do the sleazy nocturnal decadence thing as well as anything in the latter's catalog, although with a rawness that makes up in sonic texture for what it lacks in terms of speaker-bumping polish. But for such a short recording Rose shows an impressive range, dipping into quasi-classical piano-based ambient landscaping with 89-second-long ""Loss Config."". The remaining two songs offer two contrasting takes on Caribbean-inflected post-R&amp;B-- ""So Soon We Change"" is a bedroom jam overlaid with psychedelically bright washes of color, while ""138"" is darker, glitchier, and more like dancehall night in a cyberpunk novel.</p>
<p>Just as it's difficult to compare Rose's productions with McKinney and Illangelo, it's equally as hard not to imagine how the material on <i>Zodiac</i> would have sounded with Tesfaye on it. Jesse Boykins III's vocal on ""Come""-- the only non-sampled singing on the EP-- gets close to Tesfaye's presence, but there's something a bit too clunky and self-consciously Weeknd-ish about his performance. (Then again I'm not sure if Tesfaye could keep up with Rose's vision for ""Loss Config."" and ""138"".)</p>
<p>If Rose's claims are the truth, then he got screwed out of most of the benefits others gained from a sound he helped invent. Then again <i>Zodiac</i> is an addictive little record, and he's still growing as a musician at an impressive rate. Recently he signed a songwriting deal with indie mega-producer Paul Epworth's Wolf Tone label, and he says he's going to use the opportunity to get better at playing instruments. He's only 23. He's going to be fine.</p></div>"|17238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17238-zodiac-ep/|6.8|Miles Raymer

Collectively, Crow and bassist Armistead Burwell Smith IV don't overlap so much as interlock like gears and cogs, all doing their part in establishing a consistent momentum. It's also true in the larger, metaphysical sense that you can ""set your watch"" to Pinback. No matter how quickly time flies metaphorically, Pinback keep their own internal pace, independent of all outside noise occurring in the typically long gaps between their full-lengths. So it makes sense that, despite being five years in the making, their fifth LP, <i>Information Retrieved</i>,<i> </i>turns out to be another chance to identify What Pinback Do, celebrate it, and also acknowledge its limitations.</p>
<p>Though it lacks the overt seasonal appellations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6299-summer-in-abaddon/"" target=""_blank""><i>Summer in Abbadon </i></a>and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10656-autumn-of-the-seraphs/"" target=""_blank"">Autumn of the Seraphs</a></i>,<i> Information Retrieved </i>does follow the chronology of its immediate predecessors into the feel of the wintry months. But as with previous openers ""Non-Photo Blue"" and ""From Nothing to Nowhere"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14086-proceed-to-memory/"" target=""_blank"">""Proceed to Memory""</a> gets Pinback's blood pumping just fast enough to lead you to believe <i>this </i>might be the album where they push for urgency over nuance. The lattices of palm-muted guitar and bass are instantly identifiable as their own, though it's chestier than usual thanks to a pleasingly strident vocal performance from Crow. Otherwise, the highlights typically function like illusions: Crow's melodies are almost subliminal as opposed to hummable, and whether it's the seemingly gaudy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/677-capn-jazz/"" target=""_blank"">Cap'n Jazz</a>-like riff that opens ""Glide"" or the handclapped breakdown of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14280-his-phase/"" target=""_blank"">""His Phase""</a>, everything is more aerodynamic than it initially sounds. A good Pinback song can feel like hopping aboard an already moving vehicle.</p>
<p>They still don't sound remotely like any other band besides <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4225-three-mile-pilot/"" target=""_blank"">Three Mile Pilot</a>, with whom they have shared members, and granting listeners the ability to recognize that after a long hiatus often results in warm initial receptions for Pinback LPs. But this almost always wanes since there isn't a lot of wiggle room in the niche they've created for themselves. ""Should it be so hard to have a nice day?"" Crow bays during ""Diminished"", faintly funky and faintly jazzy in the way Pinback's piano-led songs are. And sometimes listening to Pinback, it does feel like having a nice day or any kind of base pleasure is something that has to be micromanaged within the sterilized environment they create. There are <i>faster </i>Pinback songs, but none that really rock-- ""His Phase"" comes closest, mostly because if it were distorted and pitched down an octave, you could imagine Crow's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1861-goblin-cock/"" target=""_blank"">Goblin Cock</a> side-project stealing it.</p>
<p>Lending a critical ear to Crow's lyrics for any sort of indication of what motivates this band can prove perplexing. They're not quite stream of consciousness, but a good Pinback song can make you think you've snooped on a conversation already in progress. And here, there's a strange computerized syntax to a lot of them, taking after the record's robotic title: ""I might fall/ I might break down/ But no one can outstyle you there,"" Crow offers on ""Drawstring"", sounding too stoic to even sweat. On ""Sherman"", he threatens, ""Your thoughts are horrible/ You will be punished for them."" As <i>Information Retrieved </i>cruises towards its end, the mere title of ""Denslow, You Idiot!"" pops for a band that never favors any sort of musical exclamation points-- dig deeper into its arrangement and you mostly just find drily delivered Colin Meloy-isms: ""You infantile cad/ You must have gone mad to be so vile,"" ""Revising these texts is a brazen sin/ This infraction just will not keep.""</p>
<p>There are obviously benefits to Pinback's consistency: If <i>Information Retrieved </i>is your first experience with the San Diegans, it might be your favorite album of theirs. If it isn't, there's a fine distinction between the two ways of reading, ""great, more Pinback."" As with the most recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/"" target=""_blank"">Sea and Cake</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17055-runner/"" target=""_blank"">record</a>, there's something inherently nostalgic about <i>Information Retrieved </i>delivering exactly what you'd expect. While it's something of a palliative for people tired of the news cycle surrounding Grimes or Odd Future or whatever, there's also the sense of it being a vestigial remnant of a time when ""indie"" could imply something more serious and studious, less attention-seeking but often standoffish. As a result, it's a reunion with an old friend, but not necessarily a close one. For half an hour, you think ""why don't we do this more often?"" until it ends and you remember how frustrating they can be.</p></div>"|17179.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17179-information-retrieved/|6.8|Ian Cohen

""I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs,"" they shout in unison, perfectly capturing the spectacularly apocalyptic joy of a first night out after a breakup. ""I crashed my car into the bridge, I don't care!"" Pounding, glitter-flecked production from Patrik Berger (who produced fellow Swede <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"" target=""_blank"">Robyn</a>'s already-classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11884-dancing-on-my-own/"" target=""_blank"">""Dancing on My Own""</a>) evaded the inevitable ""Where's the drop?"" by crafting an entire track that is basically just two-and-a-half minutes of drop. ""I Love It"" is textbook pop perfection: a track so mood-transforming, so replayable, and so endlessly gratifying that anybody who dared wonder this summer if Icona Pop had another one of these up their sleeves should have been answered by an out-of-office auto reply: ""Check back after Labor Day.""</p>
<p>As Icona Pop ready their full-length debut for a 2013 release, <i>The</i> <i>Iconic </i>EP gathers together ""I Love It"" along with a few previously released singles to show the strides they've made since their enjoyable if somewhat generic four-track EP, <i>Nights Like This</i>. From the self-empowered subject matter (by my count, four of these six songs would make appropriate soundtracks for glitterbombing your ex on a dance floor) to the <i>Immaculate Collection</i>-sized hubris of its title, the <i>Iconic</i> EP is a more assured collection of songs that sheds some light on what sets Icona Pop apart from their Swede-pop compatriots. They're sort of like a photo-negative of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a> circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4589-deep-cuts/"" target=""_blank""><i>Deep Cuts</i></a>; instead of teasing out the dark imagery in supposedly wholesome feelings of love and desire, Icona Pop turn pain into cathartic party-rock anthems.</p>
<p>Though ""I Love It"" stands head and shoulders above everything else Icona Pop have done to date, a few other tracks on the <i>Iconic EP</i> approach its brilliance. ""Manners"", which was first released on the <i>Nights Like This</i> EP and later as an extended single with eight remixes, is still their second-best song. Its slinky verses and signature infectious, shout-along hook (""You better reconsider! You will never do better! There is no one like me!"") are fused together by a steely, robotic beat, making ""Manners"" sound a little like Kraftwerk assembling an Ace of Base hit. It's followed by the sunbursting ""Top Rated"" (originally the double-A-side on the ""Manners"" single), yet another kiss-off to a domineering partner (""You put yourself on top and that just makes me slip and slide, and see my color fade""). The track gleams and pulsates like a minor key version of ""Starships"", which means it gets explosively cathartic once the chorus hits: ""Try to take me down, I'll be right up... Always been top rated, you think you can change it?""</p>
<p>Occasionally, the lyrics get clunky enough for you to wish that Charli XCX could co-write every Icona Pop song, or at least be on call for edits. ""Good For You"" has a decent melodic hook that gets unfortunately muddled by a lyrical tongue-twister-- ""You love my love, you're never gonna find better love/ You hate my love because you're dead without it."" It's a far cry from the streamlined sloganeering of ""I Love It"", whose every line felt like something that belonged on a billboard. ""Ready for the Weekend"", on the other hand, feels a little<i> too</i> streamlined-- the indistinct lyrics and pitch-shifted, helium vocals scrub away Icona Pop's signature sound. It's the EP's only true misfire, a wannabe club banger that insists a little too hard and momentarily misplaces Icona Pop's effortless cool.</p>
<p><i>The Iconic </i>EP is neither self-consciously artsy enough nor American pop-radio-ready to play directly to either side of the pop/indie divide, but Icona Pop are emerging at a time when it's starting to feel as though artists like them don't have to make that sort of choice anymore. They don't have to look far for role models: Robyn's made huge waves with her heartfelt fembot-pop and hasn't had to compromise the eccentricity of her vision, and Charli XCX seems to be charting a similarly individualized course as she preps her debut LP. Add in the mounting influence of K-pop's neon dreamscapes, and this inventive and promisingly liberated moment in pop seems like something Icona Pop are primed to seize. When we interviewed them for our <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8848-icona-pop/"" target=""_blank"">Rising</a> feature this summer, the pair ticked off a wide array of influences, from M83 to Prince to Britney Spears, before Hjelt declared, ""You can do whatever you want and call it pop!""</p>
<p>The moments when Hjelt and Jawo sing solo seem fewer, or at least more forgettable, than the times they sing-shout together, but it's not to Icona Pop's detriment-- it's kind of what they're all about. In the same way that Robyn songs like ""Dancing On My Own"" and ""Dancehall Queen"" embody female independence and self-sufficiency, Icona Pop project something oddly unrepresented in pop music right now: female friendship. As I was reading about the recent Nicki-vs.-Mariah blow-up and thinking about how much the media still love a good ""catfight"" narrative, watching interviews with Icona Pop felt like a breath of fresh air. They met on a night not so unlike the one immortalized in ""I Love It""-- Jawo had just been dumped, and a friend dragged her to a party at Hjelt's house. They raged all night and vowed to start a band the next day.

The Glaswegian vocalist and multi-instrumentalist's second album <i>Tragicomedies</i> is a maze of confusion, contradiction, and epiphany. Don't get me wrong, it's good-- vastly superior to his 2010 debut effort, <i>Great Western Laymen</i>-- yet it requires a patient ear, because to fully engage is to embrace the aural equivalent of a carpet being pulled out from underneath you over and over again. Not any old carpet, but the most ornate, antique Persian rug: <i>Tragicomedies</i> twists and turns luxuriously and theatrically, shredding skins in a looping cycle that runs the gamut of emotion from poignancy to parody.</p>
<p>There are moments of great beauty and befuddling disconnection, often within the same song. Lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13757-melpomene/"" target=""_blank"">""Melpomene""</a> is the key to the album's peculiar appeal: A spirit-lifting classical piano recital that swells like a wave at high tide suddenly drops to a vocal break that smacks of disappointment. The change of pace and timbre disturbs, but then a breeze whips down and we're off again, lifted above and away in an ivory spiral. Once the dust from the jarring juxtaposition settles, it makes sense: The song is more beautiful because of that moment of discomfort. Our emotions don't do seamless segueing, Zygadlo seems to be saying, so why should melody-- music's most persuasive narrator-- submit to unnatural, neutered neatness? He signals as such with the title. Melpomene is one of Greek mythology's greatest muses, most commonly associated with tragedy, but her roots lie with watching over melody. </p>
<p>Zygadlo takes many melodic risks on <i>Tragicomedies</i> but doesn't always come up trumps. ""Black Rhino"" is the album's bull in the china shop, a clumsy interlude that feels more than a little naive. ""Waltz for Daphnis"" sounds like a a barbershop quartet crashing a tea dance, in a teeth-grindingly awkward way. That said, the hits far outweigh the misses. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14268-russian-dolls/"" target=""_blank"">""Russian Dolls""</a> is a densely layered elastic pop song, veering off course enough to beguile yet snapping back seductively into shape at the last possible second. In stark contrast, ""The Domino Quivers"" is a brooding, bittersweet number that pushes his dubstep beginnings to experimental folk territory, and it's all the better for it. ""Persephone"" is music box pin-perfect. ""The Deaf School"" has a digital funk edge and includes perhaps my favorite modern xylophone bridge, so delicately pretty yet potent enough imbue the rest of the song with its energy. It's those few transient, transformative seconds that we hang on for.</p>
<p>In fact, a deeply transformative, intrinsically tragicomic moment hangs at the heart of the album. An accident in Berlin, in which Zygadlo fell through a window and was found by a stranger, which would be slapstick if it wasn't so nearly tragic, is the subject of ""Tragicomedy"". ""You saved my life/ How embarrassing/ You saved my life/ How mortifying,"" he sings, then a moment later: ""A bloody window/ A broken human."" The song's regret springs from his failure, in the chaotic moment, to thank his stranger-savior. And yet he seems aware of the humor in the situation, the ridiculousness of it. That sense of the ludicrousness of life runs throughout <i>Tragicomedies</i>. It's what gives it its spark and forgives its slip-ups. What remains, however, is his boldness, and his attempt to stretch, successfully for the most part, mainstream ideas of melody. </p></div>"|17188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17188-tragicomedies/|7.5|Ruth Saxelby

That record, with its gothic, bloodstained imagery and bleak post-punk guitars, carried all the warmth of a medieval hex: It opened with a gurgling, feral scream that sounded like something peeling off your skin with its incisors. Wolfe's vocals channeled PJ Harvey in full <i>Rid of Me</i> ""lick my injuries"" mode, and earlier she'd released a cover of the cheery Burzum number ""Black Spell of Destruction"". It spooked a lot of people to attention.</p>
<p><i>Unknown Rooms</i>, as she <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8955-chelsea-wolfe/"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Brandon Stosuy recently, was her attempt to connect to her ""folk roots,"" citing a love of Townes Van Zandt and Hank Williams. But this isn't exactly her campfire record, unless that campfire is surrounded by plague and marauders: Wolfe has kept the kernel of eerie blankness and premonition even as she tones down the vampy theatrics.  Ironically, she digs even deeper into your skin than before. Sometimes a lullabye can freak you out even more than a midnight horror flick.</p>
<p>Her voice, in these wide-open arrangements, emerges as stunning: Her whispered, wispy high notes on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13927-the-way-we-used-to/"" target=""_blank"">""The Way We Used To""</a> and ""Spinning Centers"" are lovely and convey unsettling frailty, like a hurt creature lurking in a corner that you aren't sure you should touch. The imagery isn't accidentally chosen: Wolfe seems powerfully drawn to vulnerability-- hers, yours, ours-- and she finds multiple ways to make you taste this unease. One of those is to make herself sound weak, trembling: She floats tiny, wordless harmonies in the background on ""Spinning Centers"", multi-tracking her close-mic'd voice into a pale, enervated choir. Around her, bowed string harmonics sigh dryly, drawing her further out of her body into the surrounding ether.</p>
<p>The songs themselves are stark, still, often nothing more two open chords strummed in common time. Surrounding them are a violin or two, muted horns, and acres of the white space. In their fidgety stasis, the songs capture some of the poetic nervousness of early Cat Power: When Wolfe whispers ""Boyfriend, be careful if you can,"" on ""Boyfriend"", drawing the word ""boyfriend"" haltingly, like an extraterrestrial voicing its first English word, I was reminded of Marshall's ""Nude as the News"", where news of a pregnancy is delivered as end-times prophecy: ""I've got a son in me/ And he's related to you/ He is waiting to meet you/ He is dying to meet you."" Wolfe's <i>Unknown Rooms </i><span>contain some of the same mundane menace, and it's a refreshing reminder of the horror to be mined from the good old boring everyday world.</span></p>
<p><i>Unknown Rooms</i> is a short album, but its nine songs capture and sustain free-floating fear and menace. And even a few pockets of tenderness: On the quietly expansive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14342-flatlands/"" target=""_blank"">""Flatlands""</a>, over two-finger-picked chords, Wolfe sings, ""I never cared about anything you ever owned/ I want flatlands, I want simplicity/ I need your arms wrapped hard around me."" On closing track ""Sunstorm"", Wolfe pounds two major chords on piano with brittle force, crooning, ""I remember/ everything you said,"" until she dissolves. <i>Unknown Rooms</i> might be a stylistic sidestep for Wolfe, a dalliance with a simpler set-up, before she plunges back into the icy black again. But even if she goes full-on Carrie-at-the-prom next, it seems likely she'll only continue to gather force.</p></div>"|17180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17180-unknown-rooms-a-collection-of-acoustic-songs/|7.7|Jayson Greene

Despite their deceptively daydreamy demeanor, they're a band that makes you work for it. While their second album, <i>Untogether</i>, strongly suggests their definition of an existential crisis amounts to not being able to decide whether their favorite New Order song is ""Age of Consent"" or ""Thieves Like Us"", frontman Michael Lee keeps his hushed, delicate voice at a considerable distance, forcing you to wade through the songs' fuzz-covered jangle and bright synth shimmer to get at their emotional core. </p>
<p>At a time when like-minded contemporaries such as M83 and the Pains of Being Pure at Heart have revealed the commercial potential-- or at least steady festival guarantees-- that can be mined from mid-80s British underground sounds, Letting Up's commitment to their forebears' downsized dimensions and twee-as-fuck temperament seems positively defiant. The band gets considerable mileage out of simplicity: <i>Untogether</i> comes fully stocked with the sort of minimal but richly melodic Bernard Sumner-esque guitar patterns (""Scratch"", ""Take My Jacket Pauline"") and dry-iced, strobe-lit Hacienda flashbacks (""Postcard"", ""Bulletproof Girl"") that make for pure indie pop catnip. And despite working within intimate, drum-machined parameters, the band evinces a greatness of depth to its sound-- upon hearing the baritone guitar hook underpinning the effervescent opener ""Visions"", it's natural to mentally substitute in a cello line.</p>
<p>But while Letting Up are game to mix up their production palette-- the stuttering breakbeat chorus of ""The Best Part"" practically verges on drum'n'bass-- the impact of these 10 songs is dulled by Lee's uniformly smeared, sighing vocals, which are too verbose to serve merely as texture, but too sedate to convincingly communicate the interpersonal narratives seemingly at play here. Whether the lyrics call for a tender affirmation like ""the best part is you,"" or a biting rebuke like ""I can't believe you said those things to me,"" the mood is one of constant, hazy-headed serenity; even the secondary vocals of keyboardist Annah Fisette prove to be more of a complement than a counterpoint, a squandered opportunity to introduce some he-said/she-said tension. Ultimately, listening to <i>Untogether</i> feels a lot like receiving a particularly pressing phone call from a significant other in the middle of student-disco dancefloor: You assume what's being said is important and impassioned, but it's hard to fully connect with the message.</p></div>"|17173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17173-untogether/|6.0|Stuart Berman

You know them when you hear them, because dance music at its most rote and workaday is often more about execution, about DJs having conversations with other DJs, about having enough material to fill a marathon set and yet another podcast. Dan Snaith has been <a href=""http://www.spin.com/blogs/caribous-dan-snaith-on-daphni-radiohead-and-the-edm-barfsplosion"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dipping his toes</a> in these waters. He plays long sets at clubs around Europe when his main vehicle, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"" target=""_blank"">Caribou</a>, isn't opening for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>. He releases tough-to-snag 12""s of material he admittedly remixed solely for the purpose of DJing. Sometimes it takes a fresh set of eyes: The most invigorating thing about <i>Jiaolong</i>, a collection of dance tracks produced by Snaith under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29516-daphni/"" target=""_blank"">Daphni</a> alias, is that it's packed with ideas. It's the excitable product of an artist who could no longer watch a scene from the sidelines, who had to jump in before his brain, or his MPC's memory card, burst from abundance.</p>
<p>More than anything, it's this sense of abandon and exploration that keeps <i>Jiaolong</i> from sounding like the work of a dilettante. It's easy to draw parallels between Snaith's work and that of his longtime friend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>-- who himself released a collection of dance tracks this year after a decade of varied, homebody psychedelia-- but Snaith's work, for better and worse, is looser and more varied, not as indebted to the flourishing UK bass scene both veterans became enamored with. Snaith chases steepled, peak-time anthems before diving into bustling, jazzy house, and fearless techno melancholia.</p>
<p><i>Jiaolong</i>'s first track, ""Yes, I Know"", shares space with the grimy edits of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22117-theo-parrish/"" target=""_blank"">Theo Parrish</a> and the all-smiles filter disco of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29820-tiger-woods/"" target=""_blank"">Tiger &amp; Woods</a>, reminding us that the hoarse refrains of 1970s R&amp;B and the corroded drum machines of the 1980s make great bedfellows. Snaith, though, isn't satisfied with a killer loop and an ass-shaking beat: As the track progresses, he papers it with peals of noisy synths and burly, strongman bass. It's busy but not excessive, from an artist used to having a lot of balls in the air on any given track.</p>
<p><i>Jiaolong</i> is front-loaded. Snaith follows ""Yes, I Know"" with a remix of an absurdly rare African 7"" (it couldn't be licensed; the musicians couldn't be found) and ""Ye Ye"", the pulsing, earworm techno banger that shared a side with Four Tet's ""Pinnacles"". After these three tracks you'll be convinced that you're watching security footage of a kid in a candy shop, reaching and grasping for anything he can get his hands on, everyone a little guilty and a little geeked. The remainder of <i>Jiaolong</i>, though, is far more scattered, as Snaith moves from frantic sequencer battlegrounds (""Springs"", ""Light"") to chin-stroking beat science (""Ahora"") and back again. The porous, call-and-response refrain of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14305-pairs/"" target=""_blank"">""Pairs""</a> and the acid-soaked improvisations of ""Jiao"" come closest to matching the sheer giddiness of the opening tracks.</p>
<p>In the interview above, Snaith admitted that the Daphni project-- which purportedly includes still-unreleased material earmarked for Snaith's DJ appearances-- has freed him from the constraints of Caribou, which at this point is closer to a standard rock democracy. Caribou is a band used to juggling multiple melodic ideas, a band that has to place a premium on organization and concision. Daphni's less focused moments sound like Snaith taking a toy off the shelf, Slinky-style, bending and prodding it at his leisure. That image doesn't do justice to Snaith's best moments, though. The point is not Snaith's juvenilia, or inexperience; it is that Snaith's fascination shines, taking him places that po-faced peers are blind to.</p></div>"|17183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17183-jiaolong/|7.5|Andrew Gaerig

Except <i>every</i> Of Montreal record lately seems geared toward a continually shrinking base of diehards. The Athens, Ga., band has sunk deeper into a rabbit hole of conceptually dense, erratic, and frankly exhausting music since the band's acknowledged peak, 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9796-hissing-fauna-are-you-the-destroyer/"" target=""_blank"">Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?</a>.<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9796-hissing-fauna-are-you-the-destroyer/"" target=""_blank""> </a></i>Even those of us who appreciated the sheer number of batshit ideas spilling out of 2008's comically overloaded <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12328-skeletal-lamping/"" target=""_blank"">Skeletal Lamping</a> </i>were finally tired out by 2010's mannered sex-funk extravaganza <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14640-false-priest/"" target=""_blank"">False Priest</a></i>,<i> </i>and then bored by this year's turgid <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16250-paralytic-stalks/"" target=""_blank"">Paralytic Stalks</a>. </i>Now Of Montreal are getting lapped by young turks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30523-foxygen/"" target=""_blank"">Foxygen</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/"" target=""_blank"">Tame Impala</a>, who navigate the cosmic space between classic rock, psychedelia, and dance music with a firmer grasp of songcraft and none of the tiresome masturbation, musical or otherwise.</p>
<p>A collection of leftovers and buried treasures from Of Montreal's recent period of artistic decline hardly seems enticing, and yet <i>Daughter of Cloud </i>is good enough to justify not completely writing them off just yet. Two of the best tracks-- the spacey country number ""Feminine Effects"" (graced with a beguiling lead vocal by Rebecca Cash) and the fractured dance-pop hip-swinger ""Psychotic Feeling""-- were relegated to a Record Store Day release (in a slightly different version) and an obscure EP respectively. Which is a shame, because they demonstrate that Of Montreal's mastermind Kevin Barnes is still capable of sticking with a single musical idea per song and carrying it out extremely well.</p>
<p>The same goes for other standouts on <i>Daughter of Cloud</i>, including the fantastically poppy acid folk of ""Micro University"" and the beautifully icy ""Noir Blues to Tinnitus"", which moves along on a stunning robotic pulse that Barnes lets slowly unfold and breathe for more than five minutes, without forcefully cramming in three time-signature changes, screaming multi-track vocals, or violently vomiting strings. ""Our Love Is Senile"" is another keeper, with the core tools in Barnes' arsenal-- a disco bassline, snappy guitar lines, aloof dandy vocals-- plied with uncommon focus and restraint.</p>
<p>At its best, <i>Daughter of Cloud </i>is a reminder of how good Barnes can be when he imposes discipline on his outsized talent for producing groove-heavy, tuneful psych-rock songs. Unfortunately, <i>Daughter </i>also has plenty of examples of what happened to Of Montreal's music once Barnes grew bored with discipline, and decided to follow his muse blindly down whatever needlessly convoluted avenue it took him. Sizeable swaths of <i>Daughter </i>consist of tracks that simply do not cohere; ""Steppin' Out"" and ""Partizan Terminus"", like so many Of Montreal songs lately, are mini-suites composed of elements that could be developed into several other, better tracks if Barnes didn't just cram them together.</p>
<p>Like his hero <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a>, Barnes is a gifted songwriter, musician, and performer capable of making any kind of music he wants, and he's been indulged by those around them to do just that. But, as much of Prince's recorded output illustrates, absolute freedom to pursue every creative whim no matter how misguided doesn't always (or even frequently) result in mind-blowingly brilliant music. Sometimes it just keeps you locked inside your own head. <i>Daughter of Cloud </i>accurately depicts an artist who has pushed his artistic license to its very limit. It also makes a convincing argument for the virtue of accepting some of those pushed-aside limitations.</p></div>"|17252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17252-daughter-of-cloud/|5.8|Steven Hyden

""I call Brett Anderson from Suede my spirit animal,"" Tamaryn's eponymous frontwoman <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2012/10/02/download-tamaryns-fader-mix/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Amber Bravo of <i>Fader </i>with regard to her playlist for their <i>Fader Mix series</i>. Even though she said in <a href=""http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2011/02/tamaryn-live-at-moma-ps1-interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">another interview</a> at MoMA PS1 last year, ""People compare us to My Bloody Valentine, the Cure, the Cocteau Twins. Those are my favorite bands so it's a huge compliment,"" she eschewed the obvious influences this time around in favor of Clan of Xymox, John Cale, and Care, and <i>Tender New Signs</i> immediately puts distance between the band-- whose instrumental half is provided by Tamaryn's longtime collaborator, producer, and guitarist Rex John Shelverton-- and the listener.</p>
<p>On their first record, 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14586-the-waves/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Waves</i></a>, the title track began with ""Come down to the surface"" as Shelverton's whammy bar undulated with an almost sexual tension against Tamaryn's warm, inviting siren song. <i>Tender</i>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13921-im-gone/"" target=""_blank"">""I'm Gone""</a>, on the other hand, lowers the temperature to crisply kicked drums and mere suggestions of reverb. Tamaryn taunts, ""I'm gone/ Tell me when/ I'm going"" in a voice alternating disarmingly between Harriet Wheeler's saccharine coos and Victoria Legrand's weathered incantations. This time, she demands the listener take note of her departure instead of go somewhere with her. Tamaryn sound different, further away than the abrasive ardor of their first album.</p>
<p>This studied separation extends to Shelverton, who finds that ""getting in the studio and taking things apart to adjust the subtleties of their sonics"" has been one of the biggest influences on Tamaryn's work, <a href=""http://www.mexicansummer.com/shop/tamaryn-tender-new-signs/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">according to Tamaryn</a>. And <i>Tender New Signs</i>' songs tend to break open along the quavering lines from Shelverton's 1964 Gibson: on ""Afterlight"", her voice soars above the murmuring bass and picked chords that politely retreat into the background for the chorus, accentuating with restraint as opposed to volume. Exquisite album closer ""Violet's in a Pool"" pulses with the barely discernible yet inexorable march of a tambourine, followed by Shelverton's busted fade-outs. The tails of reverb still fall into each other, but it sounds mathematically arranged, like colliding ripples in a pond. ""This is it,"" Tamaryn sings. ""The sound is moving in.""</p>
<p>It's up to her to bring these elements together under her conceptual framework, which she does magnificently. As with most grand gestures, there are a few trip-ups-- namely, the distractingly mixed metaphors such as ""She's a fool/ But time's a thief""-- but the grander ambitions of songs in which those appear remain undaunted. Tamaryn evokes Dum Dum Girls' Dee Dee (also her partner in the short-lived side project Les Demoniaques, which appropriately covered the Jesus and Mary Chain) on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14255-heavenly-bodies/"" target=""_blank"">""Heavenly Bodies""</a> which revolves higher and higher until resolving itself in a single, beatific note; and ""While You're Sleeping, I'm Dreaming"" rattles with the unholy matrimony of ""Riders on the Storm"" and Bauhaus. </p>
<p><i>Tender New Signs</i>' slowly melting core still owes a sizable debt to <i>The Waves</i>. Stripped of the latter's layers, however, they reveal the band's vulnerability as they move forward. Nothing really happens in ""No Exits"", but nothing needs to: ""New nature/ No nature/ Like a gun/ I've been holding on,"" Tamaryn admits, alone except for Shelverton's dripping guitars. They follow with ""Prizma"", the album's lightest track. It's almost childlike in its simplicity, written in Dr. Seuss colors and thrumming with the muted pop of other relatively young bands like Papercuts or Crystal Stilts. These, along with ""Garden""'s picket fences of noise and the meandering ""Transcendent Blue"", provide a welcome counterweight to the album's painfully thoughtful beginning and end.</p>

Further exploration of the record confirms this suspicion.</p>
<p><i>Stunt Rhythms</i> is less a fully realized album than a collection of experiments where Tobin messes around with pop music idioms that his snobbier fans might find beneath him: arena EDM, grime, hip-hop. Overall it's like flipping through the sketchbook of a respected conceptual artist only to find it full of expertly rendered pornographic cartoons. Whether it's a unique opportunity to peek into a talented musician's creative process or a throwaway collection of sonic gags depends on your tastes.</p>
<p>To his credit, Tobin never treats the styles he's dabbling in with condescension. While he toys with listeners' expectations in each of the genres he tackles, he always shows respect for their aesthetic frameworks. When he pushes a style's sonic boundaries, he litters his tracks with nods to some of its defining sounds-- the Beasties-worthy cowbell in the grime-rap hybrid ""Snap"", for instance, or the impressively gnarled synthesizer wub-wubs on the more EDM-leaning tracks. In most of the areas where he's experimenting, a song can live or die based on the novelty of its individual sounds; Tobin's expert ability to warp synths and samples into compellingly twisted one-of-a-kind shapes means most of his genre workouts actually work out.</p>
<p>The cost of all of this casual experimentation is a lack of focus that touches nearly every cut on <i>Stunt Rhythms</i>. Most of the songs clock in close to three minutes, and while this brevity prevents them from overstaying their welcome, it also doesn't leave them much room to go anywhere. Most repeat one or two parts a couple of times and then simply end. This can be frustrating when the song fragments point somewhere interesting. ""Sweden"", with its smeary low end, and ""Defender Rhythm"", which evokes the arcade-era video games, could both work as backing tracks for a sufficiently daring rapper, but if they had something like a defined verse-chorus-verse structure they'd be monsters. On the other hand ""Magoo""-- whose bumptious rhythm, pinched funk keyboards, vowel-y synth croaks, and oblique titular reference seem to suggest Tobin's best Timbaland impression-- gets out of the way just before it starts to get irritating.</p>
<p>Despite its sketchy nature, <i>Stunt Rhythms</i> has obvious appeal to certain kinds of listeners: DJs of a certain bent have some breaks to work into their sets, and established Amon Tobin fans will walk away with a new perspective on an established artist. Everyone else will likely want to stick to the more fully realized stuff he releases under his given name.</p></div>"|17122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17122-stunt-rhythms/|5.6|Miles Raymer

A decade or so back, former scrappers Aaron Espinoza and Ariana Murray set out to reshape their sharp-edged sound into something finer, more regal. After paring themselves down to a duo on 2007's <i>Mentor Tormentor</i>, the entire operation's grown only more streamlined: freer from detours, less and less fond of dissonance, nary a note out of place or a chorus left to run on too long. Their almost classicist way with melody has proved a double-edged sword for the band; the craft's admirable, the detail-work first rate, but their increasing insistence on everything-in-its-right-place perfectionism (and their increasing unwillingness to push things past the midtempo) make even the sturdiest of their late-period efforts awfully hard to get excited about. <i>System Preferences</i>-- their seventh LP, and first in four years-- is the latest in what's becoming a long line of sumptuously arranged, immaculately written, laudably restrained, risk-averse Earlimart LPs that winds up earning most of its flaws from Earlimart's pursuit of flawnessness.</p>
<p>""U&amp;Me"" gets things going slowly, with Espinoza making ""one last request: forget the past."" It's advice he doesn't seem particularly keen on taking; lest you doubt Earlimart's bona fides when it comes to pop history, <i>System Preferences</i> is sprinkled with lyrical nods to a couple of Beatles songs, one from Earlimart's old pal Elliott Smith's <i>XO</i>, and, curiously, Velvet Underground skronksterpiece <i>White Light/White Heat</i>. Heavy-lidded lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14260-10-years/"" target=""_blank"">""10 Years""</a> owes something to the Breeders, and ""I'm Safe Inside"" has a bit of that overcast <i>Summerteeth</i> vibe. But <i>System Preferences</i> is so well-steeped in its influences-- capital-P pop, mostly of the California- or chamber- variety-- it rarely sounds too much like anybody for very long. But therein lies the problem: the melodies at the heart of <i>System Preferences</i>' songs-- warm, uncomplicated, straight down the middle-- seem so unwilling to ruffle any feathers that they don't end up doing much of anything.</p>
<p>Espinoza's studio know-how's been the saving grace of many a lackluster Earlimart tune going back at least as far as their 2003 peak <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2652-everyone-down-here"" target=""_blank""><i>Everyone Down Here</i></a>, and he leaves every surface on <i>System Preferences</i> sparkling. Woozy mellotrons and flickering harpsichords play around the edges; each sound's treated or troubled in some way or another. While tarting up their lesser songs has gotten Earlimart through some rough patches in the past, lots of <i>System Preferences</i>' trickery ends up working against it; the fingerpicked flutter of ""Sweater Weather"" and the single-lane power-pop of the horribly named ""Internet Summer"" are both so bright, they're blinding, and many songs feature just a wisp of a countermelody you wish they'd have run with instead of burying in the back of the mix. Still, <i>System Preferences</i>' abundance of surface pleasures give you something to go on when the songs themselves don't; the downtrodden shuffle of ""Crestline, CA."" starts out promisingly enough, but when it slumps into its chorus in an almost grudging fashion, its dazzling arrangement's about all you're left with. ""Lovely Mary Ann"", a psychedelicized post-doo wop number in the vein of Paul McCartney's ""Oh Darlin"", feels like a copy of a copy; you can make out the outlines, but much of the definition's gone. Espinoza's running his high everydude voice through a lot less processing on <i>System Preferences</i>; they wind up sounding like guide vocals, rough outlines in serious need of some personality. If nothing else, this album makes it clearer than ever that Murray's the better singer here, and her two lead vocals-- ""10 Years,"" ""Get Used to the Sound""-- all but run away with the album.</p>
<p>An orchestral swirl eventually swallows closer ""Over Andover""; birds chirp, a folder is dragged into an electronic dustbin, followed by the familiar slurp of the ""Empty Trash"" sound. This is a dare; Espinoza and Murray know their music isn't fit for one-and-done consumption, that its merits tend to reveal themselves with a little patience. But, while prolonged exposure's been good to past Earlimart LPs, it's not really the case with <i>System Preferences</i>. In pursuit of sophistication, everything's gotten so carefully contoured, so rounded off at the edges, that you just kind of slide right off of it. While it's never less than pleasant, it's rarely all that much more. The overly fussy, played-too-safe <i>System Preferences</i> seems to be begging for a bit of Earlimart's old weirdness, an oddly placed bridge, a couple of bum notes, a ""Burning the Cow"", <i>something</i>. Without it, this record winds up feeling a little too perfect for its own good.</p></div>"|17105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17105-system-preferences/|5.7|Paul Thompson

Black Emperor</a> were the right band at the right time. They arrived with their debut album,<i> F#A#∞</i>, in 1997, when the speed of technology was accelerating, genres were being shuffled, and people were thinking about where music might go. Godspeed, a loose and mysterious collective from Canada (guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29658-efrim-manuck/"">Efrim Menuck</a> seemed like the leader, but they preferred to be received as a unit) with an anarchist political bent who fused <a href=""http://www.enniomorricone.it/uk/news.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ennio Morricone</a>, minimalism, found sound, and metal-inflected noise, presented one intriguing possibility.</p>
<p>The group stayed busy during its initial run-- by 2002, when they released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3487-yanqui-uxo/""><i>Yanqui U.X.O.</i></a>, they had put out three expansive full-lengths and a long EP-- and then they put Godspeed on the shelf and went away for a while. If they'd never gotten back together and had never released another note of music, it wouldn't have mattered. Their legacy was secure. But Godspeed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/38440-godspeed-you-black-emperor-return/"">started playing live again </a>in 2010 and, just as it was when they first came on the scene, they filled a hole in music that we either didn't know existed or had forgotten about. Then, two weeks ago, came the surprise announcement of a new album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48130-stream-godspeed-you-black-emperors-new-album/""><i>Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!</i></a>, their first in exactly 10 years. Once again, their timing is impeccable. If Godspeed around the turn of the millennium felt like a band of the moment, now, in a time of rapid cultural turnover and bite-sized music consumption, they feel out of step in a very necessary way.</p>
<p>It's tempting to look at <i>Allelujah!</i> through the lens of politics, especially since Godspeed themselves have so often encouraged this viewpoint. When we last heard from them on record, it was a year after 9/11, the invasion of Afghanistan was well underway, and the war in Iraq was just around the corner. We were settling into a decade that was, from an American perspective, defined by two wars started by an increasingly unpopular president and an inflating economic bubble that would pop just as he was leaving office. Their music and presentation drew some of its energy from this anxiety. So listening to new music from Godspeed now-- during an election season, when the wars and the aftermath of that economy are still being argued every day by two presidential candidates grappling with the legacy of the early 2000s-- you can't help but allow the political moment to shape how it's heard.</p>
<p>But the focus on the band's politics obscures something important: Godspeed You! Black Emperor are making art, not writing editorials. And the fact that they are making art gives them leeway to do things that wouldn't work in the context of pure rhetoric. It allows them to find magnificence in destruction and build an aesthetic out of decay and loss. So for all their political slogans, pointed titles, and references to global doom, engagement with Godspeed's music can feel exceedingly personal. When listening to their music, I'm not necessarily thinking about the downtrodden transcending their place in the capitalist hierarchy or the end of the world; I'm thinking about the <i>idea</i> of transcendence, the raw grace of noise, and the tragedy of endings. Godspeed's music works so brilliantly because it can be abstracted and scaled, blown up into an edifice that towers over a continent or shrunk down to something that feels at home in a bedroom. So mapping the contours of their grand music onto your own ordinary life can feel both natural and inspiring.</p>
<p>The two lengthy tracks on <i>Allelujah!</i>, ""Mladic"" and ""We Drift Like Worried Fire"", have been part of the band's live repertoire since 2003. So the record feels in one sense like Godspeed taking care of unfinished business, presenting existing music from their influential run in a context that showcases its full force and power. Taken together, those tracks serve as a 40-minute summary of everything that made this band great. ""Mladic"" is all gloom and menace, building from an opening vocal snippet, adding pings of guitar, strings that saw away in a Middle Eastern mode, and dark clouds of feedback. This is the Godspeed that learned so much from the pummeling repetition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a> and the fiendish drama of metal. There's not exactly <i>hope</i> in a track like ""Mladic"", but there is a kind of darkly shaded catharsis. Godspeed have never sounded quite this heavy, and it's especially impressive in how far it can veer from the themes that hold it together without losing the thread.</p>
<p>""We Drift Like Worried Fire"" is the flip-side of ""Mladic"", both literally and figuratively. For all their grim black-and-white roadside imagery and scenes of destruction, it can be easy to overlook just how joyful Godspeed's music can be. Built around a simple guitar motif consisting of just a few notes, ""Worried Fire"" is one of those accruing pieces that gathers one element after another for 10 minutes until it's so gorgeous you almost can't take it. And at exactly that moment, Godspeed pause and then push the music over the top with an explosion of guitar that snaps everything that came before into focus. ""Worried Fire"" is music that makes you forget about politics and the machinations of the record business and the bullshit of internet chatter and brings you into singularity with the sheer beauty of their sound, music to make you cry with a smile on your face. When it's playing, the rest of the world goes away for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>""Worried Fire"" is also the kind of song that Godspeed's early peers (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"">Mogwai</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"">Dirty Three</a>) as well as the bands that followed (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"">Explosions in the Sky</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2816-mono/"">Mono</a>) write with some regularity, but they never quite hit these heights. Godspeed have always been about more than volume, more than just addition and subtraction. And if <i>Yanqui</i> found them getting a little too close to their descendants, <i>Allelujah!</i> makes clear that Godspeed will always own this sound. Few can match their feel for arrangement or sense of structure. And the two shorter tracks on this album, ""Their Helicopters' Sing"" and ""Strung Like Lights at Thee Printemps Erable"", are evidence of their infallible ear for texture. They're both rich, dense drones, ""Helicopter"" an especially thick mix of feedback and accordion while ""Strung Like Lights"" is airier and more unstable, not unlike the locked groove that came at the second side of their debut <i>F#A#∞</i>.</p>
<p>In one of the many inserts that came with the vinyl version of that debut, there's a <a href=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vRmQe1R6rFc/UHuJBSI-PcI/AAAAAAAAMqU/d-5UNlD_S2Q/s1024/godspeed-fa-infinity.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">diagram</a> that takes the form of an architectural blueprint. It's called ""Faulty Schematics of Ruined Machine [to Scale]"" and it contains a drawing with four axes marked as Fear, Hope, Desire, and Regret and text describing elements of the diagram in cryptic and desperate language. One paragraph highlights a drawing of a tape loop connected between a distant satellite and a broken tape machine, a loop ""so long it was rocketed thru atmosphere by wigged-out Soviet Cosmonaut... it will take three lifetimes to hear in its entirety."" Godspeed use tape loops, both live and on record, and the key visual element of their shows involves the projection of 16mm film loops by collective member Karl Lemieux. For this band, there's always been something appealing about repeating cycles and rituals-- sounds and images that vanish over the horizon and then come back around again, like the trains that roll by their practice space at Hotel 2 Tango. Planets orbit, people are born and die, and music has a moment and then vanishes before returning again. And so it goes with <i>Allelujah!</i>, an album of music that is both new and old from a band that we thought we might never hear from again, one we should appreciate while we can.</p></div>"|17283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17283-allelujah-dont-bend-ascend/|9.3|Mark Richardson

This sets up <i>Former Lives </i>in an interesting way. It's the first LP Gibbard is releasing under his own name and also the first music he's released since a very public split with Zooey Deschanel, the inspiration for much of <i>Codes &amp; Keys</i>,<i> </i>which is now an album that's actually way more interesting in hindsight. If there was ever a time for Gibbard to get mean <i>and </i>get personal, it's here. Instead, <i>Former Lives</i> collects 12 songs that span ""eight years, three relationships, living in two different places, drinking then not drinking,"" but somehow feel impersonal, like their main goal was to sound like they could come from someone other than Ben Gibbard.</p>
<p>It's probably coincidental that the cover art of <i>Former Lives </i>bears a strange resemblance to that of 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11501-narrow-stairs/"" target=""_blank""><i>Narrow</i> <i>Stairs</i></a>, though the juxtaposition of these two records does help elucidate Gibbard's shift in songwriting as a solo artist. In 2009, he attempted to connect with a darker, more intoxicated source of inspiration by communing with the spirit of Jack Kerouac at Big Sur on <i>One Fast Move or I'm Gone</i>, a collaboration with Son Volt's Jay Farrar. On <i>Former Lives</i>,<i> </i>he travels further down the 101 for Los Angeles and specifically the Largo nightclub, agora for the city's mature singer-songwriters and their accomplices, people like Aimee Mann, Jon Brion, and Grant Lee Phillips. They're often called ""classicist"" and ""mature"" artists, and with the glaring exception of Fiona Apple, carry themselves more like artisans than artistes.</p>
<p>Mann is one of the L.A.-based well-wishers who contribute to <i>Former Lives</i>, and from the outset, it feels like Gibbard is trying to make <i>them</i> feel at home. The minute-long intro ""Shepherd's Bush Lullaby"" has a couple of lines that are tempting to read into (""As you sleep an ocean away/ Know that I love you/ My every thought is of you/ The clouds are beginning to break""), yet the focus is entirely on its comparatively <span>outré</span> <i>a cappella</i> harmonies. Same with ""Dream Song""; lyrically, it's pure Gibbard, a winding yarn of a couple's sleep states that deals completely in the unsaid and never leaves the space between his own ears. But the tack pianos, stuffy Britpop shuffle, and up-front vocals recall the production on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a>'s ""Los Angeles"" album <i>Figure 8</i>, the one where his jones for canonical songwriting similarly left his usually candid lyrics prone to glib formula. Likewise, on the he-said/she-said, post-marital post-mortem of ""Bigger Than Love"", Mann's voice is ingrained with typically hard-won wisdom and disappointment, whereas Gibbard sounds like he has since the beginning, which is to say, boyish and innocent; the dissonance in age makes for an inspired, but miscast duet. </p>
<p>Still, the songs on <i>Former Lives </i>boast an undeniable melodic sense. Even as he shifts from his typically elliptical songwriting to more structure-bound forms, he never sounds overly fussy. It makes <i>Former Lives</i> a brisk listen even when the songs themselves aren't particularly innovative; ""Lily"" and ""A Hard One to Know"" are Gibbard's shots at silly and sweet McCartney-styled love songs that are ephemerally enjoyable and vanish on contact due to an aggressive lack of specifics. Especially with ""Lily"", you're tempted to sub in a pretty similar first name so that puffy lyrics like ""Lily's the Pacific Ocean and I'm standing at her shore"" can scan as something other than puffy poetry.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47666-listen-new-ben-gibbard-teardrop-windows/"" target=""_blank"">""Teardrop Windows""</a> boasts a superb, instantly memorable verse melody and a conceit that's wholly Gibbard's own; granting Seattle's Smith Tower the capability of being catatonically depressed might initially appear like the most blatant example of Gibbard's self-conscious attempts to be selfless, but then again, here's a guy who was able to survey the entire dissolution of a relationship in the time it took to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgHzEqGEywA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">look in his glove compartment.</a> It's a shame he has to tack on ""he's lonely just like me and you"" to underline what was a fairly obvious premise. Even more blatant is ""Oh, Woe"" which tries to personify sadness in the same manner as the National's ""Sorrow"" did, but ends up zealously overwritten and equally underdeveloped.</p>
<p>And that's really what <i>Former Lives </i>comes down to, that Gibbard's eight years of solo writing is content to manifest as an application into Largo's Singer-Songwriter Finishing School rather than anything that packs the idiosyncrasy, resonance, or mannered experimentation that he's capable of. Whereas Gibbard uses gloopy metaphor and cloying rhyme within Death Cab to open up new possibilities for emotional expression, <i>Former Lives </i>employs the same methods to ultimately insulate songs that don't have much of a core. You don't get to really know the subject of ""Duncan, Where Have You Gone?""; you feel happy for Gibbard that he's getting to work with Aimee Mann. The ambiguity of Gibbard's southern sojourn ""Something's Rattling (Cowpoke)"" leaves you little to connect with other than the wafts of Tex-Mex horns. Who knows if this would've been better or far worse had Gibbard gone all <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/36-heartbreaker/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heartbreaker </i></a>on us, but I can't help but remember his cruelest line to date when it comes to <i>Former Lives</i>' pretty vacancy: It's beautiful, but it don't mean a thing to me.</p></div>"|17176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17176-former-lives/|6.0|Ian Cohen

Sometime Pitchfork contributor Drew Daniel and his partner M.C. Schmidt entered operating rooms to sample liposuctions, plastic surgeries, bonesaws, and other medical procedures for their 2001 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5151-a-chance-to-cut-is-a-chance-to-cure/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure</i></a>. Their work has been constructed from bowed rat cages and the slow plod of feet traipsing through a box of gravel; it's far more tactile than anything usually described as ""electronic"". Even earlier tracks such as ""It Seems"" and ""Schluss"" (from <i>Matmos</i>) were so abundantly expressive it felt like they were stretching into the physical world. With <i>The Ganzfeld</i>, a three-track EP released as an extension of the central concept of their forthcoming LP <i>The Marriage of True Minds</i>, Daniel and Schmidt have plunged inward for inspiration. This is music based around a series of parapsychological experiments conducted by the pair, an attempt to turn cognitive behavior into something tangible to funnel into their work. </p>
<p>As with prior Matmos efforts, the ambition here is bold, both in the base concept and its execution. Two of the three tracks are pulled from the psychology sessions, hinting at the density of thought and vision to follow. This EP is named after a strain of testing for ESP devised in the 1930s, the same experiment the duo adapted for their tests: They conducted experiments over a four-year period in which test subjects were blasted with white noise in a state of sensory deprivation. Daniel attempted to transmit the concept of the band's new album into their minds, with his subjects' resultant thoughts forming the basis for the music on <i>The Marriage of True Minds</i>. If this release can be used as a barometer of what's to come on the full length, expect something strung up between Wagnerian grandiosity and delirious cacophony, executed with the brilliant detail of prior Matmos recordings.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14003-very-large-green-triangles-edit/"" target=""_blank"">""Very Large Green Triangles (Edit)""</a> resides in the same kind of gloriously aloof space Trevor Horn often sought out with his ZZT productions-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17080-propaganda/"">Propaganda</a>'s imposing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jspBeVa0sTs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dr. Mabuse""</a> comes to mind. There's also a playful sense of exploration, occasionally mirroring the musical foibles that Dieter Meier and Boris Blank bring to <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Yello"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yello</a>. It suggests <i>The Marriage of True Minds</i> is a surge toward a much bigger place than Matmos have worked in before. If so, it's a fitting change, and one that mirrors the scope of the prep work undertaken. But the near 13-minute ""Just Waves"" hints that the broader strokes may not be easily palatable. It's mostly constructed from voices piled on top of one another, creating a feeling akin to standing in the corner at a party and listening to conversations overlapping with one another, crafting their own peculiar forms and rhythms in the process.</p>
<p>Matmos have made a career out of trading in those kind of contorted notes and figures, so it's disappointing to find the rote club reworking of ""You"" at the heart of this EP. There's nothing about it that ties into the work elsewhere, providing a jarring and unwelcome detraction from the program. It always feels like Matmos spend a great deal of time thinking about their approach, taking one step forward then diagrammatically mapping out how that step was taken to determine how they can put a different spin on it. ""You"" may be lacking in that, but when ""Just Waves"" is stripped down to a single voice, it's a pleasingly perplexing sensation, brought about because it actually feels less logical than the battering ram of intersecting dialogue that preceded it. The ability to draw a sharp outline around the unfamiliar, to draw definition from abstraction, is something Matmos excel at, and this EP suggests all the pieces are in place for <i>The Marriage of True Minds </i>to extend that strand in beguiling ways.</p></div>"|17175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17175-the-ganzfeld-ep/|6.4|Nick Neyland

He's humbly astonishing. How to explain this guy? He's more agile, more playful, and more confident than most; almost everything that comes out of his mouth sounds catchy, even when he's just ranting semi-incomprehensibly in skits about how fresh he is. The ""should be famous"" line is a tired one, so we'll just observe that he's definitely <i>not</i> famous, at least not nationally like his sometime-benefactor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"" target=""_blank"">T.I.</a> and his other Atlanta colleagues. He had one hit in 2006, (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqZMoLXoVxs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shoulder Lean""</a>), but he is a rapper's rapper, a nerd's favorite who will probably be a local legend in his hometown for the rest of his life. His legacy is secure; his epitaph is written.</p>
<p>The Local Rapper Who Just Can't Get Over is everywhere, in every city-- here in NYC, we have Jadakiss, their grumpy-uncle patron saint, but you can find them in Philly (Young Chris, Peedi Crakk) to Chicago (Bump J) to L.A. (Kurupt, WC). Sometimes, these guys are their own worst enemies, smacking home runs when no one's looking and freezing up when the floodlights hit them. Some of them just seem content to work on a ground level, surrounded by familiar associates and making the music that retains their hometown flavor. That's Young Dro. ""Freeze Me"" was a classic of Atlanta hip hop in 2010, and did as much to push the style of street rap forward as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2MVzP4MaJ0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross' ""B.M.F.""</a> from the same year. But you wouldn't know the song was a classic unless you lived in Atlanta or learned secondhand.</p>
<p>Rap's folk history is usually written by these sorts of guys as much as by the megastars they bump elbows with, and Dro has been playing the mascot role to the hilt for the past six years. He can be counted on to put out slightly overlong mixtapes once or twice a year, each one containing at least five or six breathtaking, pull-it-back-six-times scorchers. <i>Ralph Lauren Reefa</i>, which was made available a few weeks ago, is shorter and several notches more consistent than usual, partly thanks to the involvement of DJ Burn One, an Atlanta rap producer with an unwavering devotion to the heavier, humid end of Atlanta's heritage. <span>The two previously collaborated on </span><i>Future Legends, Vol. 2</i><span>; with Burn One curating, Young Dro's occasional reliance on cheap-sounding beats disappears.</span></p>
<p>Dro can loop rings around any wide-open, Southern beat you give him: If you hand him an instrumental made up of just a few bleeps and an 808 clap, like ""Smell That Pack"" on <i>RLR</i>, he will make it feel like a piece of Silly Putty in seconds. <span>If you sit him back in a plush piece of after-party VIP-room rap (""On Set""), he will pummel its surface ceaselessly</span>. <span> His writing is packed tight with alliteration, colorful slang, and the occasional paper-cut-size confessional (""Momma get sicker, she need a liver"") and his sense of rhythm is mind-boggling. When he flexes effortlessly into double-time, you can feel your hair blow back: It might take you six replays of ""Check Me Out""'s first verse to fully hear it <i>once</i>.</span></p>
<p>When Young Dro gets soulful or quiet, he sounds a little less comfortable: ""She Gone"" is a slightly awkward remorseful-player song, ""Dreamer"" a slightly strained achiever's anthem. But when he just lets his mind and mouth fly, he's unstoppable. On ""Laid Back"", he sets up the line ""supermodel bitches flying down from New Zealand"" just so he can rack up a series of increasingly dazzling slant rhymes for  it: ""my boo vegan"" and ""a pound of new tree, <i>and</i>"" are two highlights. It's like watching someone pound you in Words With Friends while simultaneously cooking dinner and moonwalking. It seems unfair, somehow. All said, <i>Ralph Lauren Reefa</i> is one of his strongest tapes in a while, showing him at his lyrical, funny, vivid, local-hero best.</p></div>"|17307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17307-ralph-lauren-reefa/|7.8|Jayson Greene

The interplay between guitarist Greg Kubacki<span class=""s1""> and drummer </span>Elliot Hoffman does feature a lot of that tight mechanical syncopation that Meshuggah have made a career out of. That conjoined gunfire staccato is unmistakable. There are imitators, and there are groups who understand the essence, the soul of a group and build upon that distinctive sound. Car Bomb fall in the latter group. <i>Centralia</i>, Car Bomb's debut from 2007, displayed the Meshuggah influence greatly, and while it's still prevalent on their new self-released record, <i>w^w^^w^w</i> (pronounced “w click w”), Car Bomb are branching out and becoming their own group. </p>
<p>Car Bomb always had a ""catchy"" dimension, but it gets to breathe more on <i>w^w^^w^w.</i> Vocalist <span class=""s2"">Michael</span> Dafferner is largely responsible, as he has a voice for radio but also plays in an extreme metal group. <span class=""s2"">Dafferner</span>'s ""woos!"" at the beginning and end of ""Finish It"" suggest a playfulness not found in their comparably harsh, but less flexible peers. Some of the best technical groups, like Rush, Nomeansno, and many of Frank Zappa's lineups, let the listener know that despite their wide-ranging influences and knowledge of theory, they can still be pretty silly guys at heart. Car Bomb aren't as cheeky, but there are still shades of absurdity that can elicit a chuckle or two. On closing track ""The Seconds"", the band has never been more accessible. Like most of the songs, it leads off with the dependable robotic attack, then 2:04 hits and you might think you've stumbled upon a lost Deftones chorus. ""Seconds"" eventually breaks into Kubacki employing acoustic guitars under the electric chords building, almost as if the album needed an ambient section. There are similar Deftones-esque moments on ""Magic Bullet"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14396-lower-the-blade/"" target=""_blank"">""Lower the Blade""</a>, more songs that could exist in a parallel universe alternative-rock station. Still, these clean vocal parts sound alien and foreign amongst all the clanging and slamming. It's not as if the band is hesitant to utilize less abrasive sounds, they just mold them to fit with the overall chaotic, futuristic nature of their compositions.</p>
<p>For all their advancements toward accessibility, the pounding lock-step rhythms are still the core of the band, and <i>w^w^^w^w </i>ranks among the year's most unrelenting records. ""The Sentinel"" immediately bombards you with that chokehold; there's no premonition to prepare you for what's to come. Those rhythms carry the majority of the record. Car Bomb have cited IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) as an influence, and Kubacki's leads are the most readily apparent aspect of this. His Digitech Whammy abuse is best manifested on the lead breaks on ""Sentinel"", which sound like lasers becoming self-aware with bloodlust, and the nearly trance-like soloing on ""This Will Do the Job"". Vinnie Vincent Invasion boasted on their self-titled album that no synthesizers were used, but Car Bomb go for the more impressive feat of making electronic-esque sounds with standard metal instrumentation. Excess might seem to be the order of the day to the lazy ear, but there's an economy to the music, and not just in the 50-second ""Auto-Named"". There's a lot of noise, but it's always just the right amount. At 50 minutes, you know they've got more to say, but they'll leave that for another record.</p>
<p>Car Bomb started off on Relapse but didn't quite get the attention that label tends to garner. Whether or not the group's musical growth is tied to their break-off with Relapse, they clearly did not need the label's support to make such progress. Meshuggah were on Ozzfest once; Car Bomb may get a shot at Rockstar Mayhem if things play out like that.</p></div>"|17309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17309-wwwv/|7.6|Andy O'Connor

If you go beyond the amped, break-neck intensity and listen to the compositions, it becomes clear the Boston band is nearing the 25-year mark: You don't just show up and write songs like this.</p>
<p>One of the quartet's not-so-secret weapons is Kurt Ballou, the guitarist (and backing vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, etc.), who happens to be one of the most well-regarded engineers in heavy music and an endless tinkerer who'd build a snare from scratch if it meant getting the sound he needed. The central core of vocalist/in-house artist Jacob Bannon and Ballou-- along with bassist Nate Newton and drummer Ben Koller, who both joined in 1999-- have been together long enough to know each other very well, and to play almost entirely to their own strengths. As such, there's never a dull moment across <i>AWLWLB</i>'s 38 minutes. It's all peaks.</p>
<p>The record is the logical followup to 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13625-axe-to-fall/"" target=""_blank""><i>Axe to Fall</i></a>, my favorite record that year. <i>Axe</i> included a large supporting cast of friends and fellow travelers from Cave In, Disfear, Genghis Tron, the Red Chord, and Neurosis. It ended with a seven-minute song that seemed to include them all. When I <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8950-times-arrow/"" target=""_blank"">spoke</a> with Converge frontman Jacob Bannon a few weeks ago about <i>AWLWLB</i>, he said <i>Axe to Fall</i> had been the ""collaborative concept taken to the extreme."" This time, it's just the band and the watchful ear of Ballou. As Bannon put it, ""There's no artificial distortion, triggers, or Auto-Tune on this album. It's all organic, it's real sounds that capture the way the band performs live.""</p>
<p>From opener (and first single) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14119-aimless-arrow/"" target=""_blank"">""Aimless Arrow""</a> onward, the music here is mostly fast, compact, and coiled. That's Converge in general, but they've distilled the elements to even tauter extremes this time. The technical mastery is mind-blowing, as is the way they manage to squeeze in brutal melodies and hooks. The vocal lines seem to be woven into the guitars, to which they've also added a bluesier feel, a detail that reminds me of the classic post-Negative Approach Touch and Go band Laughing Hyenas-- or even the Jesus Lizard. It's a streamlined, live-sounding collection that can feel like one giant kick to the head. But they know when to give, take, and plop in a slow-grind blues riff. Tracks overlap and echo. When they slow things down to a momentary crawl with the album's longest song, the five-minute doom ballad ""Coral Blue"", it's like a chair's been pulled out from behind you. You get that in the middle of the two-minute ""Empty on the Inside"" as well as the instrumental ""Precipice"", an interstitial piece with piano, clean guitars, psychedelic soloing guitars, and deep-factory/chain-gang percussion. ""All We Love We Leave Behind"" picks all of that up gorgeously.<br/><br/>As overwhelming as <i>AWLWLB</i> may be on first listen, it's really <i>not</i> all speed. There's a thing people say about young professional quarterbacks, about how they need experience before the game ""slows down."" You get that on this album, too. In my interview with Bannon, he said: ""I feel that the current generation of listeners of heavy music are progressing a bit past their gateway bands and are digging deeper than they used to and understanding more abrasive and complex music and art. It's like being around an unfamiliar language long enough that it eventually begins to make sense."" I agree with this, and it's the reason why Converge are a band with plenty of fans who weren't close to being born when the band formed in 1990.</p>
<p>Of course, there's plenty for older audiences, too-- aging, death, decisions, punk as a way of life, and the way these things preoccupy you when you go past 30 are largely what this album is about. (It all opens with ""Aimless Arrow""'s ""To live the life you want/ You've abandoned those in need""). Bannon describes the grizzled two-minute anthem <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14300-shame-in-the-way/"" target=""_blank"">""Shame in the Way""</a> as a song about ""feeling fragmented from the traditional concept of family."" He adds, ""As I've gotten older, I've worked on mending the things I can, while being conscious of the things I can't repair."" You get this on the genuinely moving title track, too. Bannon calls it ""an open letter to the things that I feel I've left behind in order to pursue an artistic and musical direction in my life."" He says it was inspired in part by the death of his beloved dog, Anna Belle, but there's a lot more than that here: It's a classic hardcore anthem, one that looks at the decision to live a life in a particular way, and it might bring you to tears if you hear it right. Really, more than the past couple of Converge albums, <i>AWLWLB</i> feels like a hardcore record.</p>
<p>We live in a period of compression, where there's more stimulation and less time for reflection-- but we're also continually presented with a repackaged, slightly off past. Nostalgia is music's biggest seller, it seems. The thing is, underground bands that formed in 1990 are often getting back together in 2012 for reunion tours, not eighth albums. The irony of the title, of course, is that Converge are also a lesson in not leaving behind what matters. ""Predatory Glow"" ends the record with the lines: ""Let the future know/ I won't be there tomorrow/ Let the past know/ I gave them my all/ I'm aching for an end/ Grown thinner every day/ I bow down to you/ Extinguished youth."" When I asked about the song, Bannon explained: ""I am far from an 'old' person in human terms, however I've spent over half my life immersed in the punk rock and hardcore community. I am not wholly defined by that as a person, but it is something that has been part of me for a long time.""</p>
<p>And it will be, until he dies. <i>AWLWLB</i> is an example of building on and mastering the music you loved when you were younger-- something that became more than music, ultimately-- so that it has a chance to grow old with you without becoming any less vital.</p></div>"|17132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17132-all-we-love-we-leave-behind/|8.6|Brandon Stosuy

Odd Future got popular without really ever going pop, but ""La Bonita"" threatened to change that. It didn't, of course, but for all the hosannas that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a> have issued in the direction of Pharrell, this was the first song to sound like it could be dropped straight into a classic Neptunes mix. Pharrell's attempts at this kind of light, slinky funk in the past half-decade have yielded results frighteningly close to Jimmy Buffett, but ""La Bonita"" pops, thumps, and pays off at the end when Hodgy nearly cops Pharrell's honeyed falsetto.</p>
<p>So it comes as a disappointment that <i>Numbers </i>itself is a retreat into insularity. Though it's the nominal follow-up to the group's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15686-blackenedwhite-reissue/"" target=""_blank"">debut album</a>, <i>Numbers </i>follows more in the footsteps of Hodgy's <i>Untitled </i>EP, which was a pleasant, though unspectacular, foray into weed-fueled indie rap. But both that EP and <i>Numbers </i>lack the blistering energy of MellowHype's debut, and that's something that the group initially made its name on. There is no ""Fuck the Police"" on <i>Numbers</i>-- a song like ""Untitled L"", which aims to play that role, feels like its going through the motions. Odd Future's greatest asset as a collective was that they demanded you pay attention and form an opinion, and <i>BlackenedWhite </i>succeeded at doing that as well as anything the group put out. <i>Numbers </i>does no such thing. Above all, it<i> </i>asks one question: What's the end game for MellowHype?</p>
<p>That's because there's nothing wrong with making rap for stoners, but Hodgy-- the group's main MC-- isn't exactly MF Doom. He can rap on a technical level, but <i>Numbers </i>begins to reveal flaws in MellowHype's formula. Hodgy raps quickly but not exactly creatively, and without the foot-through-door bangers that pepper <i>BlackenedWhite</i>, his verses and Left Brain's wonky productions begin to bleed into each other in a way that does its individual songs no favors. Where the group's debut explicitly suggested that you play it while wreaking havoc on Halloween, <i>Numbers </i>is dragged down by a distinct aimlessness and lack of direction. </p>
<p>There are high points, but a lot of the album feels interchangeable. If songs like ""Break"" or ""GNC"" or ""Monster"" exchanged titles or switched out verses, it would be hard to tell. ""La Bonita"" doesn't have that problem, nor does ""Snare"", which effectively deploys a group of singing children (or at least the simulation of one). ""P2"" and ""Astro"", which feature Earl Sweatshirt and Frank Ocean, respectively, also stand out, but even those magnify the lack of starpower that is <i>Numbers</i>' relative downfall. </p>
<p>If there's one thing that could've improved the album, it would be the increased presence of Left Brain. His production, whether he's playfully pawing at your face with sampled guitars on ""P2"" or pounding out radio-ready synth melodies as on ""Astro"", is fantastic. His beats are mostly built from the noise up, and it would be difficult to be as obsessed with sounds as Left Brain seems to be without making beats that are formless. But that's Left Brain's charm-- the central gurgling synth figure of ""Beat"" shouldn't really work, but it's one of the most repayable things on the record. He appears too infrequently as a rapper, though-- his charming goofiness and laid-back charisma cuts through Hodgy's unflinching seriousness but isn't deployed enough.</p>
<p><i>Numbers </i>is a solid rap record, but MellowHype have shown themselves to be capable of more. They further burrow into their own world here, but it results in exponentially diminishing returns. The group that offers skewed takes on Waka Flocka Flame and the Neptunes is galvanizing, but the MellowHype on <i>Numbers </i>is standardized, and that's something it never quite seemed they would be.</p></div>"|17119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17119-numbers/|6.7|Jordan Sargent

While ""Christian metal"" is somehow still a thing, its converse is far more prevalent. Satan worship is nearly a given in certain subgenres (lookin' at you, black metal) and a near-universal scorn for religious dogma fuels a good number of thrash, death, grind, and otherwise records. Simply enough, Jesus is not our homeboy. That's why an entity like <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SabbathAssembly"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sabbath Assembly</a> puzzles as much as it intrigues-- those unearthly purveyors of both darkness and light are not only welcome, but celebrated in joyous hymn. To be fair, the music is about as far from metal as it is possible to go before morphing into Mumford &amp; Sons, but the intent is more sinister than any Gorgoroth recording. Sure, garbled odes to Baphomet are cool and all, but when's the last time Gaahl et al. arranged an entire record around the teachings and liturgy of a doomed apocalyptic cult? The evil that men do is far more frightening than the bleakest Biblical story or children's fable, and Sabbath Assembly tap into that rotten inner core in a disarmingly palatable way.</p>
<p>The addition of Throbbing Gristle's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19937-genesis-p-orridge/"" target=""_blank"">Genesis P-Orridge</a> as ""High Priest(ess)"" (or narrator, if you hate fun) adds a wild element to the proceedings. Her dry, matter-of-fact proclamations about the nature of love, death, God, and Satan float in and out of the flowery arrangements like an old black crow worrying a brace of songbirds. Taken out of context, these songs sound sweet, gentle, and utterly innocuous; once their esoteric origins are factored in, though, there's something about those clear notes, jaunty gospel shuffles, and heavenly uplifted voices that's downright unnerving. It's a bit of a headfuck listening to poppy tunes that wouldn't have been out of place in the opening minutes of the dreaded Catholic school classes of my youth, and yet those clear, angelic voices are singing sweetly of Lucifer and the end of days. ""Christ, You Bring the End"" is not exactly ""The Lord's Prayer"", but then again, the Gnostic rhetoric of the Process Church of the Final Judgment inhabits realms that stretch far beyond that homely little church in Tabernacle, New Jersey.</p>
<p>This is Sabbath Assembly's second recorded outing, and one that comes as a bit of a surprise to anyone who paid attention to their first release and the ensuing spate of live shows and festival appearances that followed. At first, it seemed as though <i>Restored to One</i> would be marked down in the book of rock history as a one-off project, albeit one of its more intriguing entries. Even founder and helmsman David Nuss seemed unsure about the band's future in inteviews, but as it's become apparent, there's plenty more source material to mine and corners of the world to invade with song and strangeness. ""Ye Are Gods"" features a new singer, Jamie Myers (Hammers of Misfortune, Wolves in the Throne Room) whose breathy, saccharine vocals replace Jex Thoth's more throaty delivery.</p>
<p>The primary focus of the album is its message, conveyed through lyrics and proclamations, so Myers' voice is front and center. The musical accompaniment meanders through genres and decades, taking a hit of 60s psychedelia here, gently ripping off Coven there, raising up to gospel heights and cruising back down into poppier territory. Oddball neofolk acts like Nest, Lasher Keen, and the Moon Lay Hidden Beneath A Cloud seem to serve as an inadvertent influence, and while groovy classic rock forms the bedrock, Nuss and guitarist Imaad Wasif play around with all manner of tones and sounds to achieve that eerily mellow vibe. ""Exit"" opens with a moody organ overture before going full-on Pink Floydian stomp, while ""We Come From the One"" is all creepy bongos and ominous spoken word. ""Bless Our Lord and Master"" starts off with tinny chimes and a warm-voiced chorus, then builds into unexpected bombast before fading out into the delicate, thrumming folk of ""We Give Our Lives"". ""Christ You Bring the End"" is a nearly acoustic ode to the bringer of doom, and the mass keeps going-- but you're still on the edge of your seat instead of asleep on your pious grandma's shoulder.</p>
<p>The penultimate track, ""Transcendence"", is a spoken word piece narrated by an original Process Church member Timothy Wyllie, who quotes from the book <i>Gods of War</i> by Process Church founder Robert DeGrimston. The words themselves are unsettling and end on a low, dry note. Sabbath Assembly clearly chose to close the ceremony in this fashion in order to throw one last spotlight onto their purpose and source material. The message is everything, and on <i>Ye Are Gods</i>, its messengers have once more done a fine job doing God's-- and the Devil's-- work.</p></div>"|17199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17199-ye-are-gods/|7.6|Kim Kelly

In Britain, the closest equivalent is pirate radio, which provides a similar function but operates illegally. But British pirate radio has become something of an institution in itself-- even John Peel got his start in 1967 via pirate Radio London. </p>
<p>Neither dance music nor clubbing originated in Britain, but raves, and rave culture, did. As the first country to embrace these activities to a nearly national level-- a counterculture so widespread, Britain's own ""summer of love"" refers to 1989, acid house, and ecstasy-- the vast majority of today's pirate stations reflect that flavor, albeit several musical generations on. Hyper-localized (an illegal transmitter that has to be frequently relocated and jury-rigged just isn't going to give you that much juice) and operated primarily by DJs, the transmissions were mainly tuned into by friends, rivals, and acquaintances: a scene partly driven by a competitive spirit to outdo what they would hear from their peers on the air or in the club, whether by DJ skills, production, or on the mic. </p>
<p><a href=""http://rinse.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rinse FM</a>, a longtime pirate turned licensed community station in 2010, is currently in the midst of its 18th birthday celebration. (You can watch founder Geeneus' recollections of its first days <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYeWYtzCpoI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.) That longevity helped Rinse to become the largest and most influential pirate going, especially around the genres of grime and dubstep, which are closely related and developed concurrently in London during the early 2000s. Long before the station went legit, its alliance with leading dubstep clubnight <a href=""http://www.ilovefwd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FWD&gt;&gt;</a> and record label <a href=""http://www.tempa.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tempa</a> became an actual collaboration-- unifying dubstep, especially. During this time, Rinse also became a record label, primarily for CD mixes from the DJs that held steady radio slots.</p>
<p>With that in mind, and an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12479-i-love-dubstep/"" target=""_blank""><i>I Love Dubstep</i></a> edition already under their belts, current station fixtures Spyro and Sian Anderson undertake a disc each for <i>I Love Grime</i>. While they might initially seem odd choices for a station co-founded by revered grime DJ Slimzee, it fits the spec of the ongoing mix series with current DJs. At 26, Spyro is already a veteran: His first Rinse mix came out in 2009, he serves as DJ for Tinchy Stryder (like Dizzee Rascal, Tinchy is now a UK pop star who came up as a grime MC), and is claimed by Ruff Sqwad crew. Sian, a rare female grime DJ, is young but has held a show on Rinse for at least a couple of years. </p>
<p>Admittedly, the distinctions between microgenres of UK dance music can be difficult to distinguish for anyone not familiar with its history, and if you don't already know what grime is, Spyro's mix might not help you figure it out; opening with a bouncy speed garage number from producer Sticky is not what you'd expect. But part of what's interesting about the mix is how Spyro helps clue listeners to the transitions of the genres. Take, for instance, Pay As U Go Cartel's ""Know We"": Produced by Wiley in 2000, it marks an indeterminate spot between MC'd garage and grime, with garage beats supporting the kind of minor key moodiness-- both in bassline and string sample-- that would become one of the primary hallmarks of grime. Mixing that classic into the irresistibly ravey, brand new UK funky/bassline Royal-T instrumental ""Inside the Ride"" underlines another branch of the family tree-- the trunk is garage, the roots are hardcore rave and jungle. This dancefloor euphoria then breaks down into the grime halfstep stagger of Teddy Music and Newham Generals' ""Doomed"": three consecutive tracks, three interconnected but different takes on British club sounds. </p>
<p class=""p2"">That play between 140 garage bustle and 70 halfstep lurch makes most of the dynamics in a lot of grime DJ sets, and here as well. The rest is made up primarily from the macho adrenalin of aggressiveness that, let's face it, is one of the best parts about grime. Grime is jagged and ruff, audio violence resolved in the release of the dance. But Spyro's so hype, tending toward selections that reflect the same, that moments offsetting that-- like C4's ""Off Track"", Low Deep's ""Straight Flush"", and Skream and Trim's ""Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dumb!""-- cut right through. </p>
<p>Sian has a charming on-air personality and a consistently excellent track selection-- with today's technology, everyone can beatmatch competently, so these things matter. Here, a stretch of 11 tracks starting with Wiley's ""Where's My Brother"", a startling example of the key producer and MC actually singing, and extending to Spyro's own remix of ""Radio"", transforming twee folk-rocker Ed Sheeran into soft R&amp;B crooner, lends synth brightness for greater texture to the grime darkness. A bit later, ""Lassie"" stands out both because the DJ Q production is a seductive pop R&amp;B grinder, but also due to Discarda's distinctive accent while narrating the highs and lows of romance. </p>
<p class=""p1"">As an MC-led dance music genre, it's interesting to note that the voices recurring most often belong to Jammer and D Double E. Both scene leaders, to be sure, but D Double benefits from a nasal-ness that makes him instantly recognizable. ""Bad 2 Tha Bone"" is based on S-X's ""Woo Riddim"", a single track so tight that the producer managed to get 44 different MCs to jump on it individually for an epic mixtape battle that D Double appears to have come out as tops on, making it his own.</p>
<p>There's not much in terms of exclusive, unreleased material here, although I suspect that has more to do with the way digital culture operates than anything else. DJs may receive tracks for free, but they're not getting much of a jump on the public anymore. And grime is still contained enough as a genre that any enthusiast can pretty much keep an eye on almost all of it as it occurs. As such, the surprises are down to small details: track juxtapositions, overlooked songs, the oddness of an MC's voice pitched up in the mix, the skill of a DJ working to make so many vocal tracks meld without clashing. These mixes are postcards from the station as it goes about its daily business of playing great music.</p></div>"|17229.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17229-i-love-grime/|7.0|Lisa Blanning

The Vancouver four piece was destined for cult status, haunting bars as hometown heroes, forever playing local shows for the small but dedicated fanbase they'd amassed. This isn't necessarily negative. Ladyhawk were always about being underdogs. Just about any song in their catalog is so self-effacing, it feels like a miracle that singer Duffy Driediger was able to shepherd it onto an album without being consumed by doubt and trashing it. In Ladyhawk's world, getting it together enough to leave the house isn't easy. Driediger sings from inside a cocoon of weed smoke and Crazy Horse bootlegs, battling personal torment from a back porch littered with empties. It's a world he's resigned himself to as a way of making art, and the reason it doesn't come off as hollow self-pity is that he makes it all so relatable.</p>
<p>Where previous Ladyhawk albums sprawled with extended guitar solos and more-than-the-sum-of-their-parts sloppy chemistry, their third full length, <i>No Can Do</i>, skews closer to lean power pop than to rambling classic rock. Driediger's voice is still cavernous, like he's singing from directly inside a painful moment instead of <i>about</i> one, but the rest of the band tightened around him. Drummer Ryan Peters offers a steady backbone to Sean Hawryluk's dense bass and Darcy Hancock, who previously was a master of down-and-out guitar solos, now chugs along at the forefront, giving Driediger's lyrics nimble freedom. <i>No Can Do</i> might be a thematically dark album, but it's Ladyhawk's lightest yet. </p>
<p>That darkness mostly comes from Driediger, who knows to stick to his lyrical wheelhouse. He's still obsessed with a particular form of adult malaise. On ""You Read My Mind"" he sings, ""Yeah, I've been soft around the middle ever since I was little/ And I'm growing softer all the time, getting high out of my mind,"" only now, instead of weaving his words across expansive sludgy guitar, the band whirls and pushes behind him. If you're not paying attention to lyrics, ""You Read My Mind"" is the most uplifting song Ladyhawk have ever written, but it's always been about the details with these guys. Driediger now writes with economy, no word is sacrificed. He doesn't just pace around his apartment when he's sad, he paces around his <i>rented</i> apartment. The fact that he's staring down his 30s in a place he doesn't own clearly isn't lost on him.</p>
<p>As much as <i>No Can Do</i> is about the secret clumsiness of adulthood, it's also not a completely clean break from the band's slower roots. Opening track ""Footprints"" finds Driediger once again singing about his reclusive life: ""I don't go out, I just stay home/ I'm so happy to be on my own."" His voice has enough cracks that he doesn't sound especially convinced of that last part. ""Footprints"" skews closer to Ladyhawk's previous work, and the band doesn't really explore that territory again until closing track ""Eyes of Passion"", which feels almost dirge-like. Though these songs approximate the sound that Ladyhawk built a following on, they're actually the album's weakest moments.</p>
<p>While it's a promising step forward, <i>No Can Do</i> feels slight, like in the process of refining their sound, Ladyhawk lost some of the gravity and humor that made them so great in the first place. <i>No Can Do</i> has a great string of singles buried in the middle of its brief runtime, but it never quite coheres into a fully formed album. You have to wonder if it really needs to, though. If Ladyhawk were to really succeed, how would a whole new generation of adults know the very specific pain of not finding your way as soon as you'd like to?</p></div>"|17245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17245-no-can-do/|7.5|Sam Hockley-Smith

The ferocious Sacramento hardcore band rose to national prominence on the strength of its last two records-- 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14102-eyes-nines/"" target=""_blank""><i>Eyes &amp; Nines </i></a>and 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15911-awake/"" target=""_blank""><i>Awake </i></a>EP-- which shored up underground punk tradition with the straightforward evangelism of bare-knuckle Luddites. Trash Talk didn't push the hardcore envelope, and that was the point: their job was to keep the flame going by spitting gasoline into its dying embers.</p>
<p>Trash Talk's new album, <i>119</i>, arrives courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a> Records, the Sony-distributed label founded by the controversial L.A. rap collective. The association with Odd Future suits Trash Talk's hyper-aggressive, hyper-angry, hyper-male music, as demonstrated by how naturally the cameos by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler, the Creator</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29241-hodgy-beats/"" target=""_blank"">Hodgy Beats</a> are integrated into the band's severe aesthetic on <i>119's</i> brattiest cut, ""Blossom &amp; Burn"". But the major-label relationship will likely make <i>119 </i>questionable in some circles, since staunch anti-corporatism is one of the fundamental tenets of the genre. On top of that, Trash Talk are now writing discernibly catchy choruses (and even bridges!). You could imagine a slightly adventurous modern rock station spinning the boisterously sullen ""F.E.B.N."" or the heavy riffing ""Apathy"" without turning off too many listeners.</p>
<p>So, does that make <i>119 </i>Trash Talk's<i> </i>big sellout move? Not exactly. Clocking in at a relatively hefty 22 minutes, <i>119 </i>is bloated to <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness </i>levels compared with the breathtaking brevity of past Trash Talk records-- it's just one song and four minutes shorter than <i>Eyes &amp; Nines </i>and <i>Awake </i>combined-- but it's still a long way from being their <i>Dookie </i>or <i>Smash</i>. Nevertheless, <i>119 </i>feels longer than its running time, since Trash Talk have slowed down the song tempos and deepened the grooves. As hinted on the doom-y <i>Eyes </i>standout ""Hash Wednesday"", Trash Talk suggest on <i>119 </i>that they might be a stealth stoner metal outfit who only now are starting to let the cannabis fully infiltrate their music.</p>
<p>Rather than stampeding recklessly forward on the heels of cataclysmic frontman Lee Spielman, Trash Talk have re-directed their energy into mountainous, pile-driving riffs that hit with a lowdown, deliberate force. At 2:14, ""Reasons"" is one of the album's epics, with Spielman's rants about being surrounded by idiots and fools shooting out like hot lava from a surly volcanic base of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"" target=""_blank"">Melvins</a>-style rumbling. On ""Dogman"", Trash Talk venture into metal-tinged psychedelia, even indulging in some dissonant almost-guitar soloing in the song's back half.</p>
<p>Those who wanted Trash Talk to stick with the ""loud fast rules"" formula will be disappointed by tracks like ""Thanks, But No Thanks"", which blasts off at a pulverizing pace before returning to the shirtless caveman stomp that dominates <i>119. </i>But while Trash Talk are no longer standard-bearers for purist underground punk, they aren't world-conquerors yet either. Whatever direction this band heads in next, <i>119 </i>will likely be seen as a transitional LP. In the meantime, they're gathering some very heavy artillery.</p></div>"|17135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17135-119/|7.4|Steven Hyden

But by decade's end, many of the movement's most visible proponents-- Guided by Voices, Pavement, Sebadoh-- had traded up to bigger labels, bigger recording budgets, and proper producers, effectively defining the idea of lo-fi as a formative phase that bands inevitably outgrow.</p>
<p>Royal Trux seemed destined to follow the same trajectory. While the duo of Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema first earned underground renown with 1990's still-inscrutable sci-fi skronk masterwork <i>Twin Infinitives</i>, by 1995, the band was signing a three-album deal with Virgin Records and hiring Neil Young's long-time right-hand man, David Briggs, to oversee their southern-rockin' major-label debut, <i>Thank You</i>. And despite its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Sixteen_(Royal_Trux_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">infamously retch-worthy cover art</a>, the 1997 follow-up, <i>Sweet Sixteen</i>, was even more sophisticated in execution, swaddling the band's grimy boogie in layers of cinematic strings and gleaming guitar solos. But Royal Trux's increasingly high-concept take on dirtbag-rock didn't exactly light up SoundScan registers: Rather than release the band's third Virgin submission, <i>Accelerator</i>, the label opted to pay Royal Trux to just go away. (Hagerty all but anticipates Royal Trux's exile from Virgin when, on the Dylan-esque ""Yellow Kid"", he moans, ""I don't like this arrangement/ Wild schemes and nothing but bad dreams."")</p>
<p>You can't blame the Virgin execs for running scared-- in sharp contrast to its two refined predecessors, <i>Accelerator</i> pulls an abrupt 180 back to the lo-fi obfuscation of Royal Trux's earliest releases. <i>Accelerator</i> found more sympathetic benefactors at the band's original homebase of Drag City Records, but while sonically of a piece with the hazy, strung-out blooze of 1992's untitled release and 1993's <i>Cats and Dogs</i>, the album continues with the more accessible songcraft the band introduced on the two Virgin releases, making this both the most openly celebratory yet eternally warped entry in the Royal Trux canon. In the hands of, say, Guided by Voices, lo-fi recording could approximate the tinny din of the golden oldies broadcast on your local AM station; <i>Accelerator</i>, however, doesn't so much evoke the sound of a classic-rock band blaring out of a cheap transistor radio as one trapped inside of it, strangled by circuitry and choking on static.</p>
<p>Royal Trux had conceived their three-album Virgin run as a triptych exploring a different decade in recent American pop-cultural history: <i>Thank You</i> was their comment on the 1960s, <i>Sweet Sixteen</i> their take on the 1970s, and <i>Accelerator</i> their interpretation of the 1980s. Not that you could necessarily tell without the advance notice: <i>Accelerator</i> bears none of the MTV-ready sleekness we tend to associate with popular music from the era and, if anything, its acid-damaged riffage, wiggy Wurlitzer vamps, and copious cowbell more closely relate to turn-of-the-70s post-hippie jam-rock. (The latest release from Herrema's post-Trux outfit, Black Bananas, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16209-black-bananas/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rad Times Express IV</i></a>, actually boasts a more explicitly 80s ethos.) But then, for all of the glamor and futurism attached to the 80s, the decade was equally defined by its retro-gazing-- the first wave of aging-rocker reunion tours, ""The Wonder Years"", and every second film at your local cinema being about the Vietnam War. <i>Accelerator</i> thus captures the experience of 80s kids who grew up thinking the most transformative moments in history had already passed them by, its distorted, disorienting production underscoring the impossibility of recapturing something that's long gone. Closer in spirit to Ariel Pink's phantasmagoric pop than its 90s lo-fi contemporaries, <i>Accelerator</i> is like an Instagram-filtered take on rock's golden age-- an attempt to recapture something authentic through knowingly artificial, premeditated means.</p>
<p>Like the previous entries in Drag City's Royal Trux reissue campaign, this no-frills re-release of <i>Accelerator</i> exists simply to put this essential album back into print rather than try to deconstruct its mystique through outtakes and demos. And besides, bonus materials are ultimately unnecessary, because this album sounds every bit as absurd, chaotic, and exhilarating as it did 14 years ago. The passage of time has brought us no more closer to figuring out the logic of the uproarious roadhouse riot ""The Banana Question"" or the absolutely demented, street-jive nursery rhyme ""Juicy, Juicy, Juice"", but their insidious earworm hooks perpetually lure you back into the clamor for further investigation.</p>
<p>Most of these tracks are simply structured, and even repeat the same lyrics throughout, but Royal Trux deviously tweak the sonics so that you barely recognize your surroundings by song's end-- over the course of five identical verse/chorus cycles, ""New Bones"" approximates the sound of walking through the eye of a hurricane, with Herrema's dead-cool drawl and the song's steady strut perilously on the brink of being washed out Hagerty's alien guitar frequencies and shortwave vocals. But <i>Accelerator</i>'s bizarro sound-world is not so overwhelming as to completely obscure Royal Trux's bad-ass essence (see the wah-wah-drenched knockout ""Follow the Winner""), nor their penchant for surprisingly lucid, affecting lyricism: in the chorus of ""Liar""-- ""I've got a taste in my mouth/ just like a burning tire""-- you've got a slogan for your worst Sunday-morning hangover. And in a late-game surprise, <i>Accelerator</i> drops its fuzz-covered facade to deliver Royal Trux's most unabashedly tender moment ever in ""Stevie"", a suave, string-swept soul ballad that could practically pass for early Steely Dan. Where the song's poignancy was once undermined somewhat by the fact that it was reputedly written in honour of Steven Seagal, today, the tribute feels that much more appropriate: after all, if a B-level 80s action star can <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Seagal:_Lawman"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">go on to play a real cop on TV</a>, then surely <i>Accelerator</i> can now stand alongside the hallowed classic rock it so brilliantly subverts.</p></div>"|17243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17243-accelerator/|8.8|Stuart Berman

On <i>Commercial Music</i>, singer/keyboardist Jarrod Zlatic and drummer/singer Nisa Venerosa's third record, they even got around to giving it a title (their second album, released in 2010, was simply named <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14451-fabulous-diamonds-ii/""><i>II</i></a>). There have been musical changes, too. Their new sound has a taut robustness to it, making it feel like the duo's grip on their craft has strengthened. There are song titles for the first time. Even the production values feel heightened. Listening to their albums back to back is like watching a relationship evolve over a long period of time, with Zlatic and Venerosa doing a slow, awkward dance around this thing they've created. On <i>Commercial Music</i> they get to pull it in a little tighter, with ""little"" being the operative word. These are small and, at times, barely perceptible changes, with all the key elements of prior Fabulous Diamonds songs subtly extended.</p>
<p>Fundamental to Zlatic and Venerosa's work is the creation of vast, encircling expanses of repetition, often taking the form of organ drones that have no tangible beginning, middle, or end. They just lie there embedded in the sound, like a giant lead weight pinning everything down. Played loud, it feels hard to move when Fabulous Diamonds hit that particular moment in their stride, like an immovable force has just been placed in your path. It's by far their biggest asset as a band, especially as Zlatic and Venerosa have steadily become experts at tension and release. ""Inverted Vamp"" ducks into a one-note trench and forcefully pulls in everything around it, causing Venerosa's gloriously flat monotone to roll over and get out of its way.</p>
<p>A useful comparison is the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>, who progressed in a similarly genteel fashion over the course of their career. Venerosa's vocals share Trish Keenan's temperate approach, never boiling over into untrammeled emotion, always staying on an even keel. Broadcast felt like a band that had to cut itself off from the world to progress, and it's easy to frame Fabulous Diamonds within the same context. There are reference points-- the crisp organ grind on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13841-lothario/"">""Lothario""</a> plays like a slowed down version of the classic <a href=""http://www.flyingnun.co.nz/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flying Nun</a> cut <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE6DDesbhbs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Buddy""</a> by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapper_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Snapper</a>; the awkwardly titled ""???"" whips up a swirl of electronic sound reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6251-silver-apples/"">Silver Apples</a>. But <i>Commercial Music</i> only makes fleeting allusions to other places and times. That strengthening of their sound, giving everything more muscle and tone, has lent more personality to this work, pushing the duo closer to a world of their own creation.</p>
<p>But it doesn't always pan out that way. Surprisingly, the gear shift to pop structure that occurs in ""Wandering Eye"" (presumably the track that sparked the album title) is ill fitting. It's possible this is a seed planted in order to fully develop it next time, but here the verse-chorus-verse structure lacks the necessary hook to elevate it to the spot it really needs to hit. It's a shame, because Fabulous Diamonds often have the feel of bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=yo+la+tengo"">Yo La Tengo</a>, who can tie up pop and avant impulses in one tidy parcel. <i>Commercial Music</i> ends with a step back into a place of pure repetition on ""Downhill"". Zlatic and Venerosa feel more comfortable there, bending ideas around an open-ended template, pulling themselves away from the confines of the shorter material on the album, knowing exactly when to pull one another back from the brink. Actual ""commercial music"" isn't Fabulous Diamonds' forte, but watching them try to dig out a place orbiting that idiom does have its merits.</p></div>"|17007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17007-commercial-music/|6.5|Nick Neyland

After Howler-- another young, unsigned local act-- were brought on by Rough Trade this past year, it was only a matter of time before a label would be interested in Night Moves. Pelant, keyboardist Mark Ritsema, and bassist Micky Alfanso seemed to realize this, withdrawing <i>Colored Emotions</i> as a free download so they could find a new record label to release it. ""It was a good decision,"" Pelant told <i>City Pages</i>' Jeff Gage. ""We worked on it for so long, we want to do it right.""</p>
<p>Enter Domino Records, who signed Night Moves in December of last year. The band then spent time in Los Angeles to work with producer Thom Monahan (Vetiver, Beachwood Sparks) to give <i>Colored Emotions</i> a ""facelift,"" adding overdubs and re-recording the drums. While the result sounds better-- edges have been smoothed over, the mix homogenized, instrumental layers stacking evenly as a cake-- Night Moves' big label debut loses some of the distinctive sparkle (including a song title change from ""Cosmic Titties"" to ""Family Tongues"") that made the band attractive in the first place.</p>
<p>Evaluating <i>Colored Emotions</i> based on discrepancies between the original and its reissue is like saying music on speakers sounds different from music on headphones, but in some cases it's relevant. The formerly lower register-heavy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14110-country-queen/"" target=""_blank"">""Country Queen""</a> bottoms out when its organ thrums and twang-y resignation are compressed, and on ""Headlights"", less is more when it comes to the added layers of reverb and longer running time. Even the enormous ""Horses"", a recent B-side to ""Headlights"" and a slow-motion anthem now and before, gets lost in Pelant's emphatically looped background vocals. Overdubs were taken from other parts of the songs, skin grafts to flesh out areas that for whatever reason were found lacking. They reinforced Night Moves' special blend of electrified, tie-dyed country, and in doing so highlighted a degree of repetition that's always permeated the band's work.</p>
<p>Drawn in equal measures from Gram Parsons and Bob Seger's heartland soul, the ingredients are all still there: the guitars rollicking through ""Family Tongues"", the hazy AM murk over the closing title track, and the short yet cinematic opus ""Put Out Your Shoulder"". They thrive in surprising opposition to each other, which is why ""Country Queen""'s new, smoother levels sound merely atmospheric. Even when that's not the case, when the original threads are repeated together over the course of the album, each element's ingenuity still becomes part of the thematic background noise. Without standouts ""Headlights"", ""Country Queen"", and ""Horses"", these other tracks would blend together. Since this is Night Moves' debut, it remains to be seen if there really are only so many permutations of electro-psych-country or if they're just a young band with plenty of time for experimentation. Like many new groups forced to do their thing in front of a wider, more skeptical, and this time paying audience, Night Moves rely on the sound that got them signed rather than pushing themselves in a new direction, and the results are not as exciting as they could've been.</p></div>"|17230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17230-colored-emotions/|6.7|Harley Brown

Up to now, Shed albums have mostly managed to stay on the right side of the perceived divide, with 2008's <i>Shedding the Past </i>yielding up delectable, exquisitely produced deep tech-house, and 2010's follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14657-the-traveller/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Traveller </i></a>drawing a more challenging set of rhythmically adventurous avant-techno sketches. But <i>The Killer</i>, Pawlowitz's least praiseworthy but most fun album to date, might end the golden run. If so, in this case it's worth ignoring the clergy. </p>
<p>From the name on in, <i>The Killer</i> presents as both sequel and counterpoint to <i>The</i> <i>Traveller</i>, its short, occasionally fragmented tracks carefully blending Shed's disparate influences in a variety of calibrations that this time are spiked heavily with a fondness for minimal techno's kickdrum-driven intensity. As you might expect, Shed's ""return"" to techno is hardly straightforward-- there's nothing as instantly familiar, let alone hands in the air euphoric, as his Detroit-inspired early classic ""Well Done (033472-edit)"", for instance. Still, for the most part, <i>The Killer </i>steps back from the rhythmic spaciousness of <i>The Traveller</i>'s best moments, in favor of a grainer, murkier, more uncompromisingly physical sound that adds 90s warehouses to 90s production values in Shed's list of fetishes. The last album's glowing, iridescent synth tones and perspicacious rhythms-- roundaboutly redolent of classic early ambient techno-- are still present, but submerged within more aggressive, punitive settings.</p>
<p><i>The Killer </i>also reverses its predecessor's narrative arc: Where that album frontloaded its unpredictable highlights before gradually subsiding into murky abstraction (leaving aside the astral drum and bass of closer ""Leave Things""), <i>The Killer </i>steadily ascends from stentorian clanking and pounding toward the light, completing its journey with one of Shed's most apollonian efforts to date in ""Follow the Leader"", a soothing piano and breakbeat bedtime story. And even if it's just this trick of sequencing, <i>The Killer </i>works slightly better than either of its predecessors as an album, with the promise of what is to come relieving the earlier stretches of some of their grimness. The gaseous (and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1686-gas/"" target=""_blank"">Gas</a>-eous) ambient interludes, too, are perfectly sequenced, offering soothing counterpoints to the album's most pummelling efforts.</p>
<p>None of which will impress those looking for a remapping of techno's geography, but it's worth emphasizing that Pawlowitz is an ideas man rather than a visionary: Each of these tunes offers a differently askew take on techno's reigning principles, and their impressiveness as individual pieces of dialogue in a wide-ranging conversation more than makes up for the absence of an overarching statement. In its finest moments, <i>The Killer</i>'s anti-editorializing perversity recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"" target=""_blank"">Carl Craig</a>'s epochal mid-90s stretch (both in his own name and as 69 or Paperclip People), and sonically, too: those massive mid-range synth tremors, the lumbering yet quirky rhythms, the sense of vinyl warmth that infuses even the most glacial passages.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Pawlowitz hasn't stepped back from <i>The Traveller</i>'s rhythmic hinterlands so much as worked to reterritorialize those spaces within more conventional techno settings. These efforts grow stronger and more personable and idiosyncratic as the album progresses: The stern ""Silent Witness"" may sound like a techno banger with indigestion, but it's hard not to smile at the seismic shudders and goosestepping beat of ""Day After""; ""You Got the Look"" powers its dub-techno glimmers with chugging, piston-like kicks, while ""Ride On"" weaves a lumpen pseudo-halfstep beat through a seething bed of synth drones and eerie glossolalia, its groove lurching forward with a wounded determination, like a heavily scarred tanker rolling into battle. </p>
<p>Starting with ""Estrange"" on <i>Shedding the Past</i>, Pawlowitz has been unable to resist throwing in one gregarious, percussive anthem on each album, perhaps as a gesture toward what he might do if he shared Craig's world-conquering inclinations as well as his production finesse. Here, a skipping homage to 2-step garage, ""V10MF!/The Filler"" could almost be crossover material, and it's a good look, boasting delicately programmed snares, chintzy organ, and a hypnotically roaming, ruminative synth melody reminiscent of (yes) Carl Craig's remix of Cesaria Evora's ""Angola"". This unexpected play for the center should be confusing-- what mindset could endorse such a move while also offering up such determinedly furrow-browed efforts as ""Silent Witness""? But <i>The Killer </i>makes the most immediate case yet for Shed's decision to chart a course <i>through </i>(rather than with or against) the currents of contemporary techno. If only all headscratching felt so good.</p></div>"|17242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17242-the-killer/|7.4|Tim Finney

Sure, anyone can do <i>crap</i> punk rock, but there is a fine to art to taking a music fueled by destructive impulses and building it to last. Toronto power trio <a href=""http://www.subpop.com/bio/metz"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Metz</a> played their first show in late 2007, and since then, they've effectively applied Malcolm Gladwell's <a href=""http://www.gladwell.com/outliers/outliers_excerpt1.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">theory</a> about the Beatles-- i.e., that it takes a good 10,000 hours of practice to become them-- to a subgenre not exactly known for its studiousness: post-hardcore sludge-punk. That five-year gap between their live and recorded debuts is not a product of laziness, but rather precision; while Metz quickly established themselves as the most brutalizing band in the city, the process of translating that essence into a record that would sound every bit as devastating and disorienting outside the confines of a circle pit was more protracted and deliberate. After a couple of small-run 7""'s, and a series of sessions helmed by producers including Owen Pallett/Dusted associate Leon Taheny, Crystal Castles engineer Alex Bonenfant, and Graham Walsh of Holy Fuck, they've distilled their set-list standards into 29 minutes of pure but artfully rendered chaos.</p>
<p>From <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings/"" target=""_blank"">Cloud Nothings</a>'<i> In Utero</i>'d pop-punk to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"" target=""_blank"">Japandroids</a>' Superchunk-gone-Springsteen heroics to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29754-the-men/"" target=""_blank"">the Men</a>'s My Bloody Dinosaur overdrive, 2012 has seen no lack of artists revamping 1990s-vintage indie rock with a more anthemic accessibility and better mastering jobs. Metz pull off the same trick, but work with more angular, insoluble materials: namely, the muscular menace of the Jesus Lizard and the relentless, power-drill discord of Drive Like Jehu. Metz songs tend to start with an isolated element-- Hayden Menzies' thundering, hammer-of-the-gods drum salvos, Alex Edkins' solitary guitar screech-- that immediately triggers a ticking time-bomb countdown for the moment when the band erupts in unison. You can see the storm coming from a mile atway, and yet, when Menzies, Edkins, and bassist Chris Slorach launch into the merciless, firestorm battering of ""Negative Space"" or the wrecking-ball swing of ""Knife in the Water"", it still startles like a sneak attack.</p>
<p>But while it ably captures the band's ferocity, <i>Metz</i> is less a recreation of the band's live shows than a surveillance-video document of it, one that's been edited and manipulated to maximize dynamic impact. There's a surface graininess that amplifies the corrosive qualities of the band's sound and the strep-throat rawness of Edkins' voice, but also serves to accentuate some of the more surprising elements in the mix-- like the ascendant ""ahhhhh"" harmonies that provide a two-second respite from the village-pillaging assault of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13848-headache/"" target=""_blank"">""Headache""</a>. The title of that song and others like ""Rats"", ""Nausea"", and ""Sad Pricks"" provide a handy summation of Edkins' bleak lyrical concerns, but that misanthropy never weighs the album down. Instead, like a pre-fame Kurt Cobain, Edkins channels his anxieties into manic release with a certain insolent swagger: In ""Wasted"", you get a glimpse of what Nirvana would've sounded like had they recorded their follow-up to <i>Bleach</i> for Touch and Go instead of Geffen.</p>
<p>Though unafraid to temper their inherent ugliness with piano taps and tambourine shakes, Metz stop short of embracing traditional pop-song melody. But they do understand pop-song economy, carefully arranging their riffs, rhythms, and screams in two-to-three-minute bursts that still feel immediate and catchy in the absence of proper sing-along hooks. Live, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14249-wet-blanket/"" target=""_blank"">""Wet Blanket""</a>'s psych-damaged fuzz-bass breakdown often gets stretched out, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_po0RTKjsC8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Made Me Realise""-style</a>; on record, it emerges as a tightly wound beast, with a white-knuckled finale that craftily blurs the line between the band's natural, primal energy and studio-tweaked trickery. Recent history is rife with home-recording prodigies who get thrust onto the stage before learning how to perform, or promising live acts who rush-release their albums so that they have something to sell at the merch table, or at least a Soundcloud link to pimp. But while evidence suggests great concerts and great records are becoming mutually exclusive ideals for aspiring artists, Metz prove that, with a little patience, you can still have it both ways.</p></div>"|17170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17170-metz/|8.5|Stuart Berman

Newman</a> for his first solo record, 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5898-the-slow-wonder/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Slow Wonder</i></a>, indie's foremost creator of over-caffeinated pop-rock signaled a small but important change in direction. On his own, Newman took a deep breath and a couple of steps back from the hopped-up band dynamic of the Pornographers; as A.C. Newman, he was presenting himself in the mold of the thoughtful and introspective pop composer. <i>Wonder </i>and 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12590-get-guilty/"" target=""_blank""><i>Get Guilty </i></a>weren't all that removed from the Pornographers in terms of sound, especially in light of that band's contemplative and somewhat draggy 2007 transitional effort <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10557-challengers/"" target=""_blank"">Challengers</a>. </i>But Newman's solo sensibility has been steadily marching toward full-fledged ""mature"" singer-songwriter-isms for a while now, and the process reaches its full fruition on <i>Shut Down the Streets.</i></p>
<p>Not only is Newman writing autobiographical songs for the first time, he's announcing it in interviews, underlining the impact that the birth of his son and death of his mother had on his creative process. ""There were all these things that just seemed so mammoth, and I was trying to make sense of them,"" Newman recently told <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/News/c_newman_talks_autobiographical_focus_of_shut_down_streets_plots_next_new_pornographers_album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Exclaim!</a> ""But at the same time, there's also this subtext of, 'Everybody goes through this. This is so earth-shaking, it seems so impossibly sad and, at the same time, happy.' I didn't want to portray it like I felt like [I] was the first person that's gone through this."" The happy/sad divide doesn't only exist in the songs that address fatherhood (the sweetest being the dad-to-son advice-dispensing ""There's Money in New Wave"") versus the songs about death (the wistful title track). This dichotomy also appears in the space of the same song; on the enchanting ""I'm Not Talking"", Newman sings about the fear of loss that accompanies getting the family life you've always wanted, over the album's most robust melding of acoustic strumming and lush synths. ""Until there's a reason to think I have a shot at redemption/ Until then I'm not talking,"" he says, hoping to beat out a cosmic jinx.</p>
<p>In the press materials for <i>Streets</i>, there's a defensive aside about the critical prejudice against so-called ""dad rock,"" which in this context refers specifically to music explicitly exploring the joys and melancholy of early parenthood. <i>Streets </i>belongs in the company of records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"" target=""_blank"">Wilco</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10219-sky-blue-sky/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sky Blue Sky </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4548-the-walkmen/"" target=""_blank"">the Walkmen</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16635-the-walkmen-heaven/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heaven </i></a>that similarly touch on grown-up themes of responsibility, aging, and the never-ending fight against fucking up a good life you've worked long and hard to establish as middle age looms.</p>
<p>These are worthy, if terribly un-sexy subjects for a record. Newman has never been a lyricist comfortable with direct and easily discernible statements, even (or perhaps especially) when he's writing openly about his own life. But the most heartfelt, eloquent sentiments on <i>Streets </i>are expressed musically. Even if you ignore every word he sings on <i>Streets</i>,<i> </i>the album telegraphs an unsettled sense of contentment. ""You Could Get Lost Out Here"" includes references to ""roots in the ground"" and uses a wilderness metaphor to describe the disillusionment that lingers in the background of any long-term relationship. But it's the music-- a sad-sack cowpoke waltz graced with stunning steel-guitar-- that truly makes ""Lost"" a heartbreaking plea not to let hard-won love unravel.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that a writer as precise and tasteful as Newman would be precise and tasteful with the musical aesthetic of <i>Streets. </i>He's zeroed in on late-70s psych-tinged and synth-accented singer-songwriter records-- specifically referencing the Gordon Lightfoot song <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH2cEDFg1Wc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Daylight Katy""</a>-- as an inspiration for the album's ""acoustic baroque"" sound. The material on <i>Streets </i>that sticks to this vein is most successful; unfortunately, Newman can't sustain the mood over the course of the whole record. Where the album falters, ironically, is with the most Pornographers-like songs, particularly the too-clever <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14286-encyclopedia-of-classic-takedowns/"" target=""_blank"">""Encyclopedia of Classic Takedowns""</a>, which never quite takes off, in spite of a springy bassline and backing vocals from bandmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/693-neko-case/"" target=""_blank"">Neko Case</a>. ""Strings"" is another non-starter, piling on layers of keyboards and guitars in ways that feel out of place on what's otherwise intended to be a quiet, late-night-with-a-sleeping-baby record.</p>
<p>A would-be song cycle, <i>Streets </i>finds Newman opening up like never before, but it's ultimately stymied by a lack of nerve. Newman's melodic gifts continue to serve the emotional core of his songs well, but he pulls his punches with opaque lyrics and too many wheelhouse-sticking power-pop cuts that keep <i>Streets </i>from achieving the impact it could have had.</p></div>"|17200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17200-shut-down-the-streets/|6.8|Steven Hyden

But here, ""children of the 90s"" is much more meaningful in the literal sense: Lead singer Philip Taylor was born in 1990 (the other members of PAWS are 23 and 26) and has no qualms about acting his age. That's the important thing to remember, since <i>Cokefloat! </i>unabashedly revels and wallows in its own youthful confusion. It's alternately thrilling and mildly embarrassing, but the way PAWS are able to come across as flawed people rather than the sums of their CD collection makes <i>Cokefloat! </i>stand out despite doing absolutely nothing new.</p>
<p>While J Mascis and Mac McCaughan taught these 90s children how to riff and that a catchy lead run can suffice where a chorus might otherwise, pop-punk acts like blink-182 taught them how to rant-- bands that are rightfully coming to the fore as influences on a lot of young guitar acts who realize straightforward hooks and shamelessly literal lyrics are often more effective than obtuseness and metaphor. When Taylor shouts, ""I've turned my woes into singalongs,"" during ""Homecoming"", it's to be taken at face value. Because the songs on <i>Cokefloat! </i>aren't particularly sharp, clever or the work of a meticulous melodic craftsman. No, they're as blustery, blunt, and obvious as the emotions described therein and all the better for it, since it's lyrics that really establish a foothold for the listener at the points during <i>Cokefloat!</i> when the familiarity of the music can make it seem less distinctive than it really is. </p>
<p>You're undoubtedly supposed to pump your fist as Taylor sings, ""tell all your buddies that I'm over it,"" during the chorus of ""Homecoming"", having forgotten the first line is ""it's been at least 10 years and I'm still holding a grudge."" Indeed, a lot of <i>Cokefloat! </i>is pissy stuff, wherein girls, parents, and basically relating to other people is an unyielding source of misery and misunderstanding. Amidst its surging riffs, ""Pony"" is indicative of a certain kind of youthful judgment, where people are turned into caricatures of their beauty or financial comfort and used as projections for resentment (""Hey there little dolly girl/ Please don't stomp and shout/ Mum and dad still pay your rent/ Don't fuck me around""). If you're unconvinced that this is stay-in-your-room shit written after the fact, try ""Get Bent"", the ""ballad"" where Taylor's can't even pretend to hide his paternal umbrage. ""'Why do you spend all your free time in your room?'/ Well maybe if you had spent some time on me you could've knew!"" he yells, while a droning, toy keyboard emerges as <i>Cokefloat</i>!'s single ""studio effect."" The climactic hook could be a field recording from a brutal answering machine message 12 beers in: ""FUCK YOU I DON'T NEED YOU ANYWAY.""</p>
<p>But PAWS' youth mostly manifests itself in how their true emotions can't help but occasionally undermine the sullen, outcast facade they're trying to project. The truly revelatory moments on <i>Cokefloat! </i>arrive when the subject matter that typically inspires the most venomous tirades comes together for the frankly astonishing ""Catherine 1956"" and ""Bloodline"". On the former, Taylor's mother is given a fittingly personal and touching tribute after succumbing to cancer, and he goes on to commemorate her as someone who gave legitimate encouragement informed by her own disappointments. Less overtly anthemic, but no less cathartic, the double-time ""Bloodline"" exhibits tough love from both sides-- Taylor grouses, ""You'll say you're fine/ We know you're not fine/ When this kicks in/ It's goodbye,"" while remembering a happier moment, ""You raised me to be what I wanted to be/ You said 'if you want it so bad then prove to me.'""</p>
<p>They're not the best songs on <i>Cokefloat! </i>because they're the kindest; that's just a coincidence. It's more in how PAWS find room to be multifaceted, to let multiple emotions conflict rather than resolve or be quarantined. You'll feel something in some way, whereas a lot of <i>Cokefloat! </i>might be a non-starter if you find either PAWS' influences or angst to be played out. <i>Cokefloat! </i>is not always admirable but it's emotionally open, and as they say, I guess this is growing up.</p></div>"|17172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17172-cokefloat/|7.1|Ian Cohen

And once that general fetish for the over-the-top becomes the object of devotion, why stop at just grime? So, on his debut album for Rinse FM's in-house label, <i>Rinse Presents: Royal-T</i>, the young British producer Mark Taylor offers a more all-embracing vision of rudely extroverted modern garage, unified by his familiar palette of turgid bass tones, decaying synth riffs and shuddering, syncopated beats.</p>
<p>The cheerfully skipping 2-step of lead single ""Inside the Ride"" measures the distance that Taylor can wander while affirming the essential constancy of his sound, its synthetic pizzicato melody and gargantuan bass drops evoking roughneck boisterousness and ecumenical joviality rather than the feminine bump and grind that was 2-step's primary raison d'être. It's still Royal-T's dancefloor, but he's happy for you to join so long as you don't knock over his beer. This is both a constraint and an asset: Leashed to the boozy exuberance/aggression split personality of the Royal-T aesthetic, nothing here can quite match the untethered heights of last year's glorious house anthem ""Cool Down"", but it's precisely that strong sense of personality that makes Taylor's work feel so distinct.</p>
<p>Operating between those poles of overt violence and cheerful good times, <i>Rinse Presents… </i>casually touches on all of Taylor's sonic touchstones without feeling particularly diverse, let alone eclectic, though this is surely because the M.O. is so firmly anchored throughout. ""Cruel to Be Kind"" offers boshing, four to the floor grime, P-Money snarling with clipped economy over the top. ""Music Box"", a collaboration with Terror Danjah, is precisely the kind of murderous kick-fest you'd expect, not at all cushioned by its rippling chimes and high-pitched vocal squeals. ""You're Saved"" is the obligatory high dudgeon garage-pop effort, featuring Ruby Lee Ryder singing rather sternly over choral-like beds of synth chords and racing 2-step beats. Put like that, the differences appear obvious, but the gleaming surfaces of the Royal-T sound-- a kind of serrated plasticity-- are so consistent that the album easily blends into a single sustained rush.</p>
<p>Or, if you're not down with this vibe, a samey onslaught. And it's hard to counter that accusation, except to note that approaching these tunes one by one may help the alienated listener grasp the range of ideas on display. ""Sax on the Beach"" (a digital download bonus) lives up/down to its title, with seven grandiloquent minutes of stirring piano chords, ear-lashing 2-step beats and smooth jazz saxophone whose only purpose is to evoke Kenny G. It's Guru Josh's ""Infinity"" for a methamphetamine generation. At the other, rigorously physical end of the Royal-T aesthetic, ""Work Your Body"", a collaboration with UK funky producer Roska, is a perfect fusion of the two producers' styles, combining the internal combustive friction of Roska's grooves with Royal-T's churning synths and general air of nuance-averse propulsive maximalism-- it's as if he just walked into the room and turned everything up to 11.</p>
<p>Even Taylor's attempts at subtlety feel, well, rather blunt: ""Missing Aurora"" may jack <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>'s ghostly textures and precise 2-step percussion, but it's Burial for a Michael Bay film, widescreen and expensive-sounding, and possessing a certain sense of dramatic inevitability that Burial himself would studiously avoid. The unselfconscious largeness of the music's gestures is not an issue of execution, but a fundamental component of Taylor's approach, less concerned with lingering in memory than overwhelming in the moment, offering a sensory overload where bigger, harder, and faster always equal better.</p>
<p>That overarching imperative helps to explain Taylor's fondness for (and loyalty to) grime and garage, whose differing takes on stiff-jointed syncopation are united in their attention-grabbing, anti-naturalist obviousness. The comic drama of these rhythmic contortions-- so easy to visualize as daredevil stunts-- is as much the point as the physical compulsion of the grooves they both create and puncture. When a sudden space opens up in the rhythm, a beat left hanging suspended only to be crushed under a sudden onslaught of kickdrums (and there's moments like this in nearly every tune here), you can hear the producer grinning in delight, and perhaps asking, ""ain't I a stinker?""</p></div>"|17282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17282-rinse-presents/|7.2|Tim Finney

The being high. And, of course, the laser beams. I have no idea if New York musician and analog synth freak Morgan Z, who records halogen-coated, futuristic movie anthems as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30628-httpsoundcloudcomstonesthrowchrome-canyon-generati/"" target=""_blank"">Chrome Canyon</a>, has ever attended one of these events. But if his debut album, <i>Elemental Themes</i>, is any indication, the guy's a season ticket holder. As a student of sci-film film composers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/"" target=""_blank"">Vangelis</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI-mDTdeKR8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wendy Carlos</a>, Z works on a cinematic scale that ranges from over-the-top to the completely ludicrous: Synths blare with a strange regality fit only for the coronation of a new Martian emperor, Theremins squiggle, keys and effects dart back and forth over too-crisp snare cracks and ballooning bass cushions. But unlike the celluloid images that those aforementioned composers had to work with, Z's inspirations feel decidedly less celebrated. Simply put, <i>Elemental Themes</i> is essentially the score to your favorite <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwyaUXuZncw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mystery Science Theatre 3000""</a> episode, only this time, the commentary is up to you.</p>
<p><i>Elemental Themes</i> is a record that really only works on one basic pleasure principle, which is to cram as much B-movie imagery into your head as possible. Outside of the Laserdome or, say, to soundtrack some niche brand of intergalactic LARP-ing, there aren't many applications for the music that Z's so carefully conjured here. You certainly can't dance to it, and while it might seem like a decent headphone voyage, Z's vision of the future is so magnificently crystalline and PG-rated that even the application of the most righteous bud wouldn't be necessary to induce a fit of the giggles. Instead, it's like living inside the cover of a dime store sci-fi novel, packed with vignettes so brightly colored and shameless in their triumphant hero themes that it's hard not to find them endearing in the dorkiest manner possible.</p>
<p>By all accounts a maximalist, Z hybridizes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Giorgio Moroder</a>'s cheesiest impulses with the bombast of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15221-reissues/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Queen</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9kCCLwEga8&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Flash Gordon</i> theme</a>, goofily refracted through the synthetic grandiosity of Mannheim Steamroller. Each track, highlighting either a playful wonder or a vague sense of danger, feels like setting first foot onto an alien landscape, only to reveal the most masterfully tacky soundstage imaginable. Though <i>Elemental Themes</i> lacks a traceable overarching narrative that would've really required a set of 3D glasses, it's still a record that only a guy wearing <a href=""http://stonesthrow.com/chromecanyon"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>these glasses</i></a> could possibly make.</p>
<p>To those not in possession of a 12-sided die, this probably doesn't sound terribly appealing, but it's important to consider that Morgan Z has talent. Using live instruments run through hand built compressors, <i>Elemental Themes</i> sounds impossibly clean and surprisingly layered, not to mention immaculately arranged. As one of the final recordings mastered by Nilesh Patel (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>), its magnified scope and clarity suggest that it was run through a crystal ball before being committed to tape. For something that's ostensibly a passion project, the level of investment is not only commendable, but it ultimately also pays real dividends. Just ask Morgan Z-- Top 40 indie poppers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29788-foster-the-people/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Foster the People</a> themselves commissioned a Chrome Canyon <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/chromecanyon/foster-the-people-pumped-up"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix of that song that drives you fucking nuts</a>.</p>
<p>Z's vision may be an outsized one, but when it's this well-executed and admirably nerdy, depending on your tolerance for what he does, it can reap fleeting rewards. It makes sense that, at almost an hour, it wants to make good on fulfilling its feature-length ambitions, though even the most devout midnight movie synth-pop fans will still find it a bit much. But if your town happens to have a planetarium and you don't have a date on a Saturday night, there's not much that's going to stop you from enjoying this.</p></div>"|17231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17231-elemental-themes/|6.3|Zach Kelly

The San Francisco garage-rocker has always been prolific, but after four years of albums, collaborations, singles, and covers, his discography has become particularly unwieldy. His output from the past year alone has been diverse. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16744-slaughterhouse/""><i>Slaughterhouse</i></a> (and on stage), he's an impish, thrashing apostle of hardcore and 1970s hard rock. With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16558-ty-segall-white-fence-hair/""><i>Hair</i></a>, his collaborative album with White Fence, he angled for jam-heavy, psych-leaning rock'n'roll. Only a year ago, he delivered his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42442-ty-segall-talks-serious-new-album/"">""serious""</a> album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15557-goodbye-bread/""><i>Goodbye Bread</i></a>, where he both cooed calmly and screamed about an exploding head. Impressively, all three of those albums are <i>really</i> good. It's a testament to Segall as a restless songwriter who can adapt to, and successfully execute, several different styles. So here we are with <i>Twins</i>, his third LP of 2012, which stands at the intersection of all of his recent interests. </p>
<p>In the tradition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13262-ty-segall-lemons/""><i>Lemons</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14347-melted/""><i>Melted</i></a>, which each had ballads alongside searing garage punk, the new album doesn't have a unified focus. With the exception of frenzied, shredding highlight ""You're the Doctor"", there's nothing especially aggressive. ""Gold on the Shore"" is his acoustic-driven, folky, sentimental love song. Then there's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14032-the-hill/"">""The Hill""</a>, the bleary psych track where Segall's voice recalls John Lennon's on ""Tomorrow Never Knows"". (The track also features some beautiful vocals from Thee Oh Sees' Brigid Dawson.) There are familiar elements from Segall's backlog in play, like that specific fuzz guitar tone, which is something like his trademark at this point, and some two-minute songs-- a number that's especially apparent on his recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16070-singles-2007-2010/""><i>Singles</i></a> collection. Those bite-sized singles pop next to lengthier tracks like ""Ghost"", the slower stoned jam, or the romantic and apocalyptic closer ""There Is No Tomorrow"". With each new song, hook, idea, and tone, it's increasingly clear that <i>Twins</i> doesn't fit in any one box.</p>
<p>It's a grab bag, and it's easy to view it as a disappointment-- to look at Segall's disparities in 2012 and want him to pick a sound and follow it for 12 tracks. But alongside his engineer partner Eric Bauer (often credited as ""King Riff""), he delivers a series of songs that, despite their aesthetic differences, flow very well. Even when he makes a significant jump, like from the giddy rampage of ""You're the Doctor"" to the paranoid stoicism of ""Inside Your Heart"", there's usually an easy thematic or sonic transition that keeps the album from sounding like a compilation. In that way, it's close in format to <i>Goodbye</i> <i>Bread</i>, which maintained cohesion despite<i> </i>several shifts in delivery and tone. <i>Twins</i>' offerings, however, are far more sugary and immediate: faster tempos, thicker fuzz, more power.</p>
<p>Lyrically, Segall thrives in two modes: songs about love with very straightforward wording (""Love Fuzz"" is a falsetto stab at seduction; the content of ""Would You Be My Love"" is pretty much stated right there in the title), and stories with a more fantastical bent. The latter approach was prevalent on <i>Slaughterhouse </i>and especially <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13671-i-bought-my-eyes/"">""I Bought My Eyes""</a>, and it comes into play here with the darkly abstract ""Handglams"" and the creepy ""is it living inside of me"" tale of ""Inside Your Heart"". </p>
<p>In the liner notes, Segall writes two things that feel fitting for <i>Twins</i>. ""This record is for San Francisco."" That makes sense-- the man's a frontrunner to become San Francisco's garage laureate. But he's also talking about his friends and inspirations-- he mentions White Fence's Tim Presley, Thee Oh Sees' John Dwyer, and the rest of the Ty Segall Band by name. It's easy to hear how the album fits tidily in San Francisco's bigger picture-- to hear Dwyer's ""falsetto-as-primary-vocal"" on ""Love Fuzz"" and ""Handglams"", to hear Sic Alps' elegant minimalism on ""Gold on the Shore"", to hear the whole town's penchant for mysterious and druggy storytelling, etc. </p>
<p>His final ""thank you"" in the liner notes goes to Neil Young, an artist who, as soon as the masses pegged him with a genre, did whatever the fuck he wanted to do and didn't look back; who never compromised on his vision, even when it meant making a bizarre, shitty rockabilly album in 1983; who famously ""headed for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditch_Trilogy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the ditch</a>"" when he felt his radio hits were ""middle of the road."" <i>Twins</i> doesn't stick to the middle or even pick a lane. It swerves, visiting territory well-tread with a perspective that feels new, and knowing Segall, he probably won't make another album that sounds like it any time soon.</p></div>"|17133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17133-twins/|8.0|Evan Minsker

The best case scenario is that an outside pathogen is to blame, a failed genre experiment, an ill-fitting producer, drugs. These are the things cult classics and critical reclamation projects are made of. The inside jobs are far more painful to endure-- records such as Travis Morrison's <i>Travistan, </i>Weezer's <i>Make Believe,</i> the Smashing Pumpkins' <i>MACHINA/The</i><i> Machines of God </i>and the Streets' <i>The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living </i>that clearly couldn't have been made by anyone but their creators, but where the same qualities responsible for such individual and affecting works of art have completely turned on their owners. <i>Mumps, etc. </i>is of the latter variety, an often unlistenable album from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4593-why/"" target=""_blank"">WHY?</a>, a group whose music is often excellent.</p>
<p>It might sound counterintuitive to claim that restraint would've worked to WHY?'s benefit here. A large part of the appeal of records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11254-alopecia/"" target=""_blank""><i>Alopecia </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13450-eskimo-snow/"" target=""_blank""><i>Eskimo Snow </i></a>was that they let Yoni Wolf run rampant lyrically and emotionally, all while his band exploded the boundaries that would have kept them in either indie rock, hip-hop, or even ""indie rap."" No matter what Wolf was going on about-- masturbation, his bowel movements, any number of ex-girlfriends-- his extremism was tethered by relatable emotions and strong hooks. Whether it was the result of taking an unusually long time off between records or not, Wolf has sunk even further into himself, but not to discover some sort of deeper truth about the human condition. Instead, a sizable portion of <i>Mumps, etc. </i>turns out to be a longform rumination on what it means to be Yoni Wolf, Lead Singer of WHY?.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if it's <i>The Wall </i>or from the perspective of a guy who admits, ""I make decent cash, I'm a minor star,"" as Wolf does on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13812-sod-in-the-seed/"" target=""_blank"">""Sod in the Seed""</a>; the ""lot of the touring musician"" album has a great track record of establishing the frightening point when an artist feels entitled to a listener's empathy despite having their most distorted sense of self. Yet it's not unthinkable for Wolf to find pathos in this scenario, since at WHY?'s level of success, ""how can I keep this up?"" is more a crisis of relatable age and economic concerns rather than that of a poor lil' rich boy in a gilded cage. But it's nearly impossible to find Wolf's situation interesting because I'm not sure he thinks it is either. </p>
<p>He repeatedly references the end of his ""rap career"" as something of a given and bemoans its terrible mundanity-- ""I can't sleep in rental cars or airlines/ Yo, and so I keep the deck of cards for downtime."" Either that, or he gets lost in impenetrable metaphor as a means of distracting from that mundanity. During the sickly mariachi lurch of ""White English"", Wolf engages in impressive verbal gymnastics in order to avoid saying what he actually means, and it's summed up by its diffident hook: ""Lost in translation."" Same for ""Thirst"", which introduces potentially loaded metaphors about black cowboys and discarded porn-stuffed G4 motherboards without delving far enough into their symbolism; when Wolf pleads, ""He will always thirst like that/ He will thirst like that always,"" it fails to register. <i>He </i>might thirst like that, but how the hell are we supposed to know what ""that"" means?</p>
<p>But when really getting to the bottom of why <i>Mumps, etc. </i>often sounds like it wasn't subject to outside QC, it isn't so much about Wolf's lyrical inscrutability but rather that long stretches of the record are just <i>really fucking hard </i>to listen to. Musically, it's perfectly fine and a logical dovetailing of <i>Alopecia</i>'s sharp hybrid of hip-hop and indie rock with <i>Eskimo Snow</i>'s forays into post-rock and folk, if maybe sidling a little too close to the sort of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1186-danger-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Danger Mouse</a>-style pop-hop it knows it can't be.</p>
<p>And that's because Wolf has completely lost a grip on judging his own vocals. They've always been an acquired taste for sure, and on <i>Alopecia </i>and <i>Eskimo Snow</i>, Wolf showed a canny command of his various modes of monotone, staggered rapping, heartsick crooning that packed unorthodox pop smarts. As Wolf attempts a more perfect union of those various modes, he ends up with a hybrid that somehow manages to bring all of his most grating qualities to the fore, to the point where the actual words of a line like ""when I got better from the mumps, yes-- my swollen nut and neck shrunk"" are the least objectionable thing about it.  <i></i></p>
<p>Combatively nasal, all jagged edges and botched notes, Wolf makes an irreversible, disheartening slide into Borscht Belt jokes about his advancing age (""I'm in decline/ But women like be jockin' still/ 'Cause I rhyme with skill and talk so chill and youthful""), retreating hairline (""Girls used to fawn over my locks-to-kill/ Now the girls are gone and I'm on Minoxidil"") or inescapable whiteness (""Rockin' soccer socks and sandals like, 'yeah, bro.'"") . Technically catchy but irritating all the same, ""Jonathan's Hope"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14277-strawberries/"" target=""_blank"">""Strawberries""</a> are the inexplicable singles, and as Wolf sings brutal rhymes such as, ""Slow pitching like a Vatican priest to be pope-- what? Dope,"" or, ""Your mom she sits while her hair is in curlers/ Smokes weed and listens to that Garrison Keillor/ That's how I'll live when I quit my rap career,"" there isn't so much of a melody as a curdling effect taking place in Wolf's mouth, like he's having an allergic reaction to his own lyrics. There too are remnants of Anticon.'s willfully arrhythmic approach to hip-hop on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14127-jonathans-hope/"" target=""_blank"">""Jonathan's Hope""</a> and ""Paper Hearts"", the latter of which might be the most unpleasant song of 2012. A noxious merger of topic, content, and delivery, Wolf cruelly describes a failed romantic encounter <i>in flagrante</i>: ""She's cute with little titties and a sense of humor/ But to tell you the truth sir, I pity the poor fool-- her,"" and, ""During sex I might put us in some joke positions/ But it's scary always how we end up in mission...airy like the daring men who fight to submission,"" aren't even the half of it. While there's no such thing as TMI in WHY? songs, it's nigh inconceivable to imagine someone listening to this for enjoyment.</p>
<p>At the very least, <i>Mumps, etc. </i>creates a new wrinkle in discussing what ""career suicide"" can really mean. It's usually attributed to albums so off the grid that fans will inevitably refuse to follow, yet those always strike me as a cry for help, a need to trigger a reaction. But I don't think that's the case here. <i>Mumps, etc. </i>does have its moments that remind you how WHY? have always been a trial by fire that demands and often rewards intense loyalty that can't be shaken easily. On the contrary, <i>Mumps, etc. </i>sounds like WHY? reading their own eulogy. Sure, Wolf claims, ""I'll hold my own death as a card in the deck/ To be played when there are no other cards left,"" on the closing song, but ""Exegesis"" ended <i>Alopecia</i> making the same exact threats, so make your own ""cry Wolf"" joke if you must. It's just that so much of <i>Mumps, etc. </i>thinks of itself in the future tense, having already given up the fight. Even beyond Wolf's decidedly pessimistic take on his current occupation, most of the songs on <i>Mumps, etc. </i>just seem to opt out of delivering hooks when they could or should and meekly tap out before three minutes.</p>
<p>But to really get to the heart of <i>Mumps, etc.</i>'s despondence,<i> </i>you have to look at ""Distance"", paradoxically the most musically accomplished and lyrically affecting song here. The sighing strings are a bit manipulative when Wolf says, ""I gotta keep my distance to withstand the silence of you missing when you're not there to listen to this nonsense,"" yet it's a real moment of resonance, and you're just left to wonder why such a typically candid lyricist took so long to get to the point. The structure of ""Distance"" would lead you to believe ""men and women might yet quote his modicum of the truth/ But never will they get right close to Jonathan Avram Wolf"" is the money quote, but it already happened. Because while <i>Mumps, etc. </i>expresses that Wolf is too in touch with his emotions to not potentially have great art left in him, it's just that I'm not sure even he believes WHY? is the best place for him to work it out anymore.</p></div>"|17136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17136-mumps-etc/|2.8|Ian Cohen

The <a href=""http://www.lordhuron.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lord Huron</a> frontman sings of river crossings, trudging through forests, shouting out his love from the mountaintops, all these big, romantic, pre-cell-phone notion of fidelity, honor, the lay of the land. After a couple of well-received EPs-- including 2010's fine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14887-mighty-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mighty</i></a>-- the Michigan-to-L.A. transplant's debut LP, <i>Lonesome Dreams</i>, finds Schneider digging his mud-caked heels into his music's more rustic side, shedding much of the electronic flourishes and international flavors of his early EPs and going to town on harmony-rich folk-rock. But by throwing the focus onto the latter half of his <i>Urban Cowboy</i> routine, Schneider's vision has narrowed, his once-vibrant, open-armed Americana now overcautious, content to shoot squarely for the middle.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Mighty</i> found Schneider couching his amber-tinted, My Morning Jacket-indebted wallops with clattering rhythms and meandering arrangements, lending the music both a dynamism and a dreamlike quality well-suited to his chronologically unfixed lyrics. Sonically, <i>Lonesome Dreams</i> is crisper, less woozy, likely a product of Schneider's time with Lord Huron's five-piece traveling ensemble. He's still drawing deep from the well of what's come to represent ""American music"" in 2012: mostly acoustic instruments, pile'o'choirboys harmonies, lyrics about long distances and time-spanning loves, that sort of thing. But, where <i>Mighty</i> saw Schneider playing with the edges of the form, <i>Lonesome Dreams</i> sticks with the tried-and-true. All this makes for a mean case of deja vu. Not only is Schneider's wanderer's spirit harder and harder to locate amidst the 100-part vocals and galloping melodies, he seems to be retreating into his influences here, with <i>Lonesome Dreams</i> traveling the same dusty trails as the current princes of the provincial, Fleet Foxes.</p>
<p>Two things here. Upon arrival, Fleet Foxes, too, were met with a lot of ""CSNY + MMJ = :S""-style hangwringing; reductive, sure, if not entirely unwarranted. And in his review of their <i>Mighty</i> EP, our Ian Cohen noted the influence of both My Morning Jacket's grain-silo harmonies and Animal Collective's bleary drift on the material while adding that this kind of influence-sleuthing alone doesn't often make for the most helpful criticism. And, you know, I tend to agree. But, man, this Fleet Foxes thing isn't just close, it's uncanny, both sonically and structurally, and it's a hard thing to see around. There was more than a whiff of Fleet Foxes in the choral pile-ons of <i>Mighty</i>, though that was cut through with that record's trickier rhythms and unfixed edges. Ten seconds into opener ""Ends of the Earth"", you've already got a rustly Pecknoldian strum and a pile of flyaway harmonies; a minute in, the song pivots, exploding into a towering vocal line that'd catch even the most dyed-in-the-wool Foxes fan wondering if they missed a demo. That chiming hollowbody guitar tone, all those 10-part campire kumbayas, verses quickly followed by a mirror-image instrumental? The gang's all here. Fleet Foxes didn't forge their sound out of wholly original material, it's true, but like any good band, they rearrange and reconstitute their sources in manner that's become unmistakably theirs. You know a Fleet Foxes song when you hear one. Unless, of course, you're listening to Lord Huron.</p>
<p><i>Lonesome Dreams</i>' instant knock of familiarity will prove comforting for some, but it gives these tracks something of a plug-and-play feel. Many songs are dramatically assembled, and all of them <i>move</i>, but when they move in pretty much the same ways as another, spryer band, it's that much harder to get caught up in their attendant drama. It doesn't help Schneider, head often planted in a very different decade, seems to be having some trouble saying much about the present through the lens of the past, so ends up not really saying much of anything at all. His love is the timeless kind, but he's so scant with details, so quick with platitudes, that it congeals into this sweet but somewhat blank mishmash of horses with no names and walking 500 miles and just-passing-through-ma'ams. But beyond a few well-worn turns-of-phrase and all that pining, there's not much meat there. Even the best of the bunch, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13913-time-to-run/"" target=""_blank"">""Time to Run""</a>, never quite gets to why exactly Schneider finds himself on the move, and skimping on details is never a good look where historical fiction is concerned.</p>
<p>Schneider remains a gifted (if less daring) arranger, able to steadily build steam throughout a track, knowing where to stick choruses for the maximum payoff without bludgeoning you with them, Mumfords-style: These songs are sturdy, and what marks they set for themselves, they hit. But <i>Mighty</i> managed all that, too, while folding in alluring pockets of psychedelia and offering up a little more to go on lyrically on than <i>Lonesome Dreams</i>' tepid Larry McMurtryisms. Schneider's certainly not alone in thinking harmony-heavy vocals, bustling strums, and a couple-three ""brother of mines"" is enough to conjure up some romanticized notion of the past. But it's all so carefully composed, so studiously old-timey, this once-vibrant vision of American music overlaid with the drab browns and coppers of a Six Flags souvenir photobooth.</p></div>"|17158.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17158-lonesome-dreams/|5.6|Paul Thompson

On 2009's <i>Drakonian Paradigm</i>, they set their sights on greatness, with 201o's <i>From the Devil’s Tomb</i> they took aim, and now, on <i>Embers and Revelations</i>, they pull the trigger.</p>
<p>While the highly listenable <i>From the Devil's Tomb</i> was a loose, depraved affair, steeped in the atmosphere and elements of its Canada-based, Bangladesh-born creator's Eastern upbringing (summed up perfectly in the serpentine ""Lefthandpathyoga""), its successor is more of a challenge. It's leaner, more focused, and utterly relentless, with riffs sharpened by genuine hatred and Satanic conviction. Vetis takes the lead role when it comes to guitars and vocals, but he's now joined by second guitarist Rom Surtr, whose skill is felt in the complex, engaging structures of the songs. The drumming is inhumanly precise, executed by the Disciple (formerly of influential Canadian black metal experimentalists Rites of Thy Degringolade) and Kha Tumos' basslines sport a rich, resonating tone that menaces as much as it anchors. The chemistry between the band's members is apparent, and the attention to detail is near-fanatical.</p>
<p>Save for the crisp, almost startlingly pretty opening salvo of ""Liber Lilith"", gone are the stealthy, slinky melodies and exotic scales that once served as Weapon's primary defense against being lumped in with those of a more homogenous ilk. They've replaced these elements with vitriol and venom. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14057-embers-and-revelations/"" target=""_blank"">""Embers and Revelations""</a> is a snarling beast, all punishing intensity and manic leads. There are moments of murky, churning simplicity, like the malevolent dirge of ""Disavowing Each in Aum"" or doomy middle passage on ""Grotesque Carven Portal"", and a few sparse but effective, not to mention beautifully rendered, moments of calm (most notably heard in the first few moments of album closer ""Shahenshah""). At its core, though, the album is black/death, despite its refusal to stay shackled to such a colorless descriptor. Those genre lines blur, and those elements that belong to Weapon-- and only Weapon-- cannot be contained. To make it easy on a casual metal listener, imagine a particularly unholy blend of Belphegor, Melechesh, Nile, Watain, and Behemoth. Now add in some Master's Hammer worship and vintage Morbid Angel appreciation, tattoo it with Kali's name, hand it a knife, then leave it to die on an unnamed street corner in any hot, dusty city. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Embers and Revelations</i> revels in Satanic majesty and sensuous filth. The lyrics, delivered in Vetis' largely decipherable mid-range growl, range from pure nihilism to sexual perversion and the despoilment of the sacred. His Eastern roots and Satanic faith surface once again, and there is a strangely poetic feel to the deviance and inhumanity of Vetis' words, made all the more unsettling by how clearly they resonate. On ""Liber Lilith"", for example, he invokes the antithesis of feminine virtue like so: ""Vile temptress, Goddess ov Drakon! Initiator of perversion in mankind!/ Let the phalli of murderers glow within Thy orifice of defecation/ O, ravishing Queen of noxious blood!/ He who repudiates Thy pulsating cunt/ Shall yield to strangulation by the severed, umbilical cord of a fetus.""</p>
<p>Weapon's Relapse debut has garnered them far more attention than their past releases, and their recent spate of touring alongside Marduk and 1349 went a long way toward raising their profile in the states, but one gets the feeling that this is only the beginning. <i>Ember and Revelations</i> is an addictive listen, and a dangerous one at that: In Weapon's world, Satan lives and humanity is divided into those who walk with him and those who cower before him. When's the last time you prayed?</p></div>"|17198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17198-embers-and-revelations/|7.8|Kim Kelly

""The music got slower... the floor would be much emptier and, more often than not, you were surrounded by amazing landscapes."" Those memories serve as a good description of Donoso's solo synth work. It's a kind of dream-state dance music, filled with rippling light and vivid atmospheres, and devoid of hard, four-on-the-floor beats. In fact, there are no drums in Donoso's pulsing tunes. All the rhythm-- and there's a lot of it-- is created through timing and momentum.</p>
<p>The resulting sound on <i>Assimilating the Shadow</i>,<i> </i>Donoso's second solo album, has roots in his dance/techno background, but stretches toward the minimalist flights of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>, the Kraut trance of<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/""> Cluster</a>, the spaced-out arpeggios of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, and film scores like John Carpenter's horror themes or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>'s bubbling soundtracks. Donoso is familiar with genre-crossing-- he's played drums in improv-jazz and avant-metal groups, and his duo <a href=""http://digitalisrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/spiritual-church-movement"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perispirit</a> veers toward all-out noise. But he melds these strains naturally, never jamming them together or grasping for superficial variety.</p>
<p>In fact, the 10 songs spread over these two LPs are pretty simple. Each starts with a basic, insistent synth figure, which slowly overlaps with similar lines while simultaneously gathering chords and accents. But as active as these tracks are, they are rarely dense and never blurry. Donoso uses space and staccato to maintain clarity; everything he's doing is always out in the open. And though he's into repetition, he also has a knack for song structure. Each tune progresses with discernible shifts that create drama in loops of tension and release.</p>
<p>In the best tracks, those loops intertwine with looser abstraction. On ""Chemical Structures"", a reflecting synth riff spawns crescendos without wavering from its solid cycle. Similar waves course through <a href=""https://vimeo.com/46488331"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Bow and the Lyre""</a>, but Donoso continually adds rippling echoes, the sonic equivalent of pelting a lake with different-sized pebbles. Most remarkable is closer ""Renunciation"", whose swarm of small sounds creates a bright buzz, like a symphony of crickets coaxing a sunrise.</p>
<p>Which again suggests that Donoso's music evokes the morning end of an all-night party. The title, <i>Assimilating the Shadow</i>, itself seems to allude to that surreal time when the sun fades in, swallowing the darkness as it rises. But according to press notes, it's a reference to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carl Jung'</a>s claim that ""everyone carries a shadow."" That works too-- there's an undercurrent of foreboding in these compositions, an ominous sense that danger lurks on the horizon of Donoso's rolling sounds. Yet nearly every moment is also calm and soothing, as easy to zone out to as it is to get chills from. Perhaps that's the strength of his music-- as simple as it sounds at first, repeat listens reveal something wider and deeper going on.</p></div>"|17241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17241-assimilating-the-shadow/|7.6|Marc Masters

But if their intent was to make a record that <i>sounds </i>like it came from that era, they've failed and ended up with something more fascinating. Sure, there's merit to the countless groups and scenes that seek out the right tube amps and compressors and microphones in order to create flawless period pieces. They're often called ""revivalists,"" even though the actual term is wasted on them. Are they really breathing <i>new </i>life into this form by keeping it cryogenically frozen in ideas nearly a half-century old? Tame Impala prove far more exciting because, by maximizing the use of the available technology, they tap into the progressive and experimental spirit of psychedelic rock, and not just the sound.</p>
<p>Tame Impala did something similar on 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14279-innerspeaker/"" target=""_blank""><i>Innerspeaker</i></a>, and they might be open to ""Same Impala""-type jokes if the expanse of psychedelic rock were something you'd be expected to move on from after one record. <i>Lonerism </i>does make the kind of tune-ups that typically generate a lot of second LP plaudits: It's leaner, more propulsive, more confident, and less beholden to its influences. But <i>Lonerism</i>'s genius manifests itself in Tame Impala's ability to figure out a way to integrate the concepts of electronic music-making without resorting to ripping off the breakbeat/Beatles template of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5NX1FC-7-w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Setting Sun""</a>. </p>
<p>Leader Kevin Parker doesn't <i>sound</i> like an electronic producer, he just thinks like one. He sees his songs as blank canvases rather than boxed-in verse/chorus structures while emphasizing fluidity, constant motion, and textural evolution. You could spend the entirety of opener ""Be Above It"" letting your ears luxuriate in the diversity of tactile sensations-- the subliminal whisper of the title becomes a rhythm track, a barreling drum break is severely tweaked to sound like an oncoming rush of bison, a flanged guitar wobbles like neon Jello, and Parker's laconic, slightly echoed vocals pulls the whole thing together. <i>Lonerism </i>could go anywhere from that point, which is confirmed by the majestic song that follows, ""Endors Toi"". Follow the regal path of the lead synth or tilt your ears towards the righteously loud drum rolls that sound like masterfully chopped Bonham/Moon samples. I'm reminded of Radiohead's stated goal on ""Airbag"", which was to recreate <i>Endtroducing..... </i>in real time, or what DJ Shadow himself has been trying to do ever since in terms of merging the rarest vinyl grooves with your stony older brother's record collection.</p>
<p>Those are the first two songs on <i>Lonerism</i>, and it's bold to lead off with seven minutes of mostly instrumentals. Yet for all of the sonic trickery, Tame Impala are anchored by the righteous aspects of classic rock. They're throwbacks in the sense that they operate from a pre-punk perspective where each musician has the chops and confidence to be capable of soloing, and the singer and the drummer were cranked loud as hell. Yes, Parker does sound like John Lennon. Many athletes pattern their golf swings after Tiger Woods, their batting stance on Barry Bonds, or stick out their tongue while taking a jump shot like Michael Jordan. It means little if you don't have the skills to connect and perform.</p>
<p>More important is how Parker writes melodies that are instantly memorable, that rise and fall with beautiful simplicity and give what are fairly basic and relatable sentiments heft. <i>Lonerism </i>lacks a chorus that instantly pops like ""Solitude Is Bliss"", which is an issue only if you think the best melodies necessarily need to appear in the middle of the song. You'd be hard-pressed to find hooks as catchy as the <i>verses </i>during the run that spans ""Music to Walk Home By"" through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13939-elephant/"" target=""_blank"">""Elephant""</a>, and while none initially stands out as the kind of hit that might push Tame Impala to bigger festival stages, the cumulative effect means <i>Lonerism </i>might.</p>
<p>So, the above is all well and good for the people who might use <i>Lonerism </i>to EQ their hi-fis. Does it make you feel anything? On <i>Innerspeaker</i>, Parker sang, ""You will never come close to how I feel,"" so what's the emotional component to <i>Lonerism? </i>Though Parker's lyrics are plainspoken and occasionally a little elusive, Tame Impala's two records are called <i>Innerspeaker </i>and <i>Lonerism, </i>some of their songs go by titles like ""Solitude Is Bliss"", ""Why Won't They Talk to Me?"", ""Island Walking"", and ""Mind Mischief"". You get the idea of where Parker's head is at, or more to the point, that Parker's head is where <i>he's </i>at.</p>
<p>That's a fairly common concern in this realm. You think about most of the technophile, prog-rock opuses of recent decades and most sound like spiritual heirs of King Crimson, Pink Floyd, or Black Sabbath; records like <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</i>,<i> Kid A</i>, and<i> The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i> tell the listener that their state of being is forced upon them, by shadowy governments, by heartless technology, by an uncaring god. It justifies the headphones-bound quarantine.<i> </i>What distinguishes Tame Impala is how they are able to explore the emotional difference between being alone and being isolated. Jayson Greene described Parker's voice vividly as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47431-report-tame-impala-live-in-brooklyn/"">""like someone trapped John Lennon's vocal take from 'A Day in the Life' in a jar and taught it to sing new songs.""</a> In terms of a mentality, to me it's more along the lines of ""I'm Only Sleeping"", embodying and advocating a wakeful and passive state of psychedelia. </p>
<p><i>Lonerism </i>derives much of its philosophical and musical pleasure from this interaction of micro and macro. Tame Impala stack vocal and guitar harmonies on the loveably hungover ""Mind Mischief"", and then Parker and co-producer Dave Fridmann take control of the mixing consoles and shake the whole thing up like a snowglobe. A similarly fun trick happens on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13851-apocalypse-dreams/"" target=""_blank"">""Apocalypse Dreams""</a>, which builds the momentum of a bouncy Northern Soul groove up to a peak before the mix abruptly cuts off and spits them back into a panoramic, HD jam.</p>
<p>All these rich sounds serve as an alternate take on anticipating technological encroachment, that humanity and technology aren't necessarily at war. You feel small while listening to <i>Lonerism</i>, but in a way that makes you appreciate how man, machine, and Mother Nature can harmonize. <i>Lonerism </i>is portable and joyous in an unforced way, a soundtrack for the times when you're walking downtown and look up at a collection of skyscrapers, or driving through a mountain pass on an interstate or even looking at a Ferris wheel next to an ocean thinking, ""Holy shit, <i>how did this all get here?</i>"" </p></div>"|17131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17131-lonerism/|9.0|Ian Cohen

He fails to elaborate, so we never find out what he thinks might irk us about Google: Google Docs (which frequently erases important data, I've noticed)? Google Reader (cramped, visually unappealing)? He just says ""Google."" The fact that he sings it through Auto-Tune gives the moment a whiff of parody. Cale has been on art-rock's cutting edge for decades; he's the only person at the center of the tag cloud ""John Cage,"" ""Aaron Copland,"" ""Lou Reed,"" ""Patti Smith,"" and ""Sham 69."" His cover of LCD Soundsystem's ""All My Friends"" rivals the original. You don't want to hear him sound out of touch.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there's that album title, which exists, magnificently, beyond the realm of normal taste and judgment. ""Nookie Wood"", to judge from Cale's heavy-breathing delivery on the titular song, is a dark, fearsome place where beasts roam and men are devoured whole. <i>Nookie Wood</i> is definitely strange, in other words. What it is not, sadly, is terribly interesting: Much like David Byrne and St. Vincent's recent<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17026-love-this-giant/"" target=""_blank""><i> Love This Giant</i></a> collaboration,<i> Shifty Adventures</i> feels well-composed, immaculately arranged, and curiously inert.</p>
<p>Part of the problem comes from Cale's production choices, which feel less of this era than the late 1980s and early 90s: The boxy drum sounds, textured surface, and tacky-stiff keyboard sounds remind me, specifically, of Peter Gabriel's <i>Us</i>. The adult-contempo sheen doesn't do the songs here, which are crawling with interesting sounds, any favors. Cale works hard, banging pianos and MPCs, running drum sounds backwards, and filling the margins with glitches and loops. His viola snakes and mingles with often lightly Auto-Tuned voice. But the album's lacquered surface coats the chaos and imposes unwelcome order. It's like watching a man fail to tear his way out of an over-starched dress shirt.</p>
<p>If Cale had brought more memorable songs, <i>Shifty Adventures</i> might have fought its way out of this middle distance. But the songwriting is meandering and vague, feeling less written than whittled out of an arsenal of studio tricks. Like Brian Eno's recent solo work for Warp, <i>Shifty Adventures</i> has an all-frame, no-painting feeling: Lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13980-i-wanna-talk-2-u/"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Talk 2 U""</a> (co-produced by Danger Mouse), is rote, dutiful mid-tempo acoustic rock, without a single unexpected turn.</p>
<p>Cale sometimes pricks the air with a soulful line-- ""I always held on to the thought/ That if they loved you long enough/ They'd find out what was missing when they finally called your bluff,"" is the mournful opening salvo on ""Hemingway""-- but vast stretches of the album amble by without giving you a good reason to pay attention, other than to note a tactile, sticky-sounding drum loop here (""Face to the Sky"") or a nice sunburst of acoustic guitars there (""Living With You""). This is what happens, sometimes, when a producer gets lost in the studio and forgets to write an album, and <i>Shifty Adventures</i> feels more like a collection of gadgets than songs.</p></div>"|17120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17120-shift-adventures-in-nookie-wood/|6.0|Jayson Greene

Pedantry, lecturing listeners and telling them what to think is bad. Those poles make up two sides bisected by a thin line, which <a href=""http://newpro.homeboysandman.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Homeboy Sandman</a> straddles for the entirety of his first LP with Stones Throw, <i>First of a Living Breed. </i>Sand is one of the best pure lyricists around, and Stones Throw seems like a natural fit. It's the perfect place to get the kind of beats that a rapper like him thrives over-- glitchy, sideways drumlines and soul-infused sunbeats, phenotypes emerging fully-formed from the masters at Stones Throw's HQ. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But when Sand starts grandstanding on a song like ""For the Kids"", it's truly a waste. This is the song that Fred Rogers would have made, had he invested time in a hip-hop side project. I wish I could say that the tribute to Whitney Houston that starts the song off is tongue-in-cheek, but it's followed by such banal advice as quit smoking cigs and ""go study for a quiz,"" ""you're not an ugly duckling, you're a swan,"" and ""the object of life ain't makin' bucks.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">There's no problem with making a positive song. But there's a massive problem with making a song that's entirely comprised of advice that kids have heard a thousand times before, without even switching up the phrasings. There's only one way I can imagine this track getting any play with its target audience: in the eventuality that some desperate parents try to show their kids that hip-hop can be <i>fun</i> and <i>healthy</i>, they will no doubt turn to ""For the Kids"". And lessons like that turn kids on to metal.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Songs like ""For the Kids"" and the similarly useless ""Cedar and Sedgwick"" are aggravating because Homeboy Sandman is capable of so much more. When he takes a topic between his teeth and chews it, there are few rappers who can compete. In the past, on songs like ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" and ""Mean Mug"", Homeboy has taken topics as serious as homelessness or as innocuous as a scowl and constructed powerful lessons around them. These meditations were all the more puissant for the fact that the rapper seemed to be exploring them for the first time himself-- he was guiding, rather than lecturing.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Thankfully, there are plenty of songs on <i>First of a Living Breed</i> on which Sandman bats a topic around like a hyper-intelligent cat professor<i>, </i>seemingly confident that his students will learn something from watching the yarn unspool<i>.</i> The most casually impressive of these is the pretty piano-rap track ""Couple Bars (Honey, Sugar, Darling, Sweetie, Baby, Boo)"". Though it's ostensibly a pick-up song in the classic mold, Sand's slow, heavily-enunciated lyrics make for observations that are at least as amusing as a simple ""Ay babay.""  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Lines like ""I don't know if you are into sports but I am hoping so,"" (which comes after a Robinson Cano reference) are charming in their odd formality, and when Sand digresses, he's often pretty damn funny. ""Wish I was your articles of clothes, just a particle of cotton on your cones, that'd be the most wonderful destiny ever, only possibility possibly better than being a stich on your sweater is being human and me and you together,"" he raps, internal rhymes going blammo. But the best part of the song is it's logical conclusion. After being so weird (""I've got you under my skin, nothin' fungal""), and going on for so long about the perfection of what turns out to be a perfect stranger, Sandman thanks the lady in question for ""inspiring a hot record"" whether or not she wants to take a walk with him. And therein lies the simplest of lessons: Do you, and don't sweat the response. If you're funny, that'll help.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Sandman takes on a host of more serious topics with the song ""Illuminati"", one of the best political rap tracks in a year positively writhing with them. Creeping production by J57 highlights the importance of listening closely, as Sand spits indisputable truth. On a song that goes as deep as this, and with my limited word count, it's best to just pick out some highlights. ""Every man is not created equal, we're all created mad different, some are bad people."" ""Think [cops] are tapping your computer, your computer is a tap."" ""The war on drugs has been goin' on for awful long, folks married to the game instead of dating off and on."" ""We used to beat on Bush but now he's not around so people found a different bush to beat around."" Though the song doesn't necessarily have a clear subject, its dual messages are simple: Don't believe what you're told and think hard.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""Show, don't tell,"" is the oldest, most clichéd writing advice ever, the kind of overused aphorism that I'd expect Homeboy Sandman, on one of his off-days, to spit in a song called ""For the Writers"". And yet, the difference between his good songs and his bad songs on this album is the difference between showing and telling. The brilliant writing on <i>First of a Living Breed </i>(along with songs mentioned above, there's the sunny, Oddisee-produced ""Watchu Want From Me?"", album opener ""Rain"" and exotic ""The Ancient"") would position the album as a candidate for one of the year's best rap records if it weren't for those drawback tracks. As it is though, we'll have to take this one as a compromised effort, and hope that, next time out, Homeboy Sandman can avoid taking us places to which we've been before.</p></div>"|17074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17074-first-of-a-dying-breed/|7.1|Jonah Bromwich

Homer's self-written vows include a series of ""sickness and in health"" dualities, one of which is ""in quiet solitude or blasting across the alkali flats in a jet-powered, monkey-navigated…"" Rev. Lovejoy doesn't finish the sentence, but you get the picture. And if you've ever wondered what it would feel like to blast across the alkali flats in a jet-powered, monkey-navigated something-or-other, <i>Maserati VII</i> gives you the chance to find out, if you play it at sufficient volume.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2694-maserati/"" target=""_blank"">Maserati</a> have always been a band that mostly left the ""post"" out of ""post-rock."" Their sense of dynamics and compositional flow is right in line with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"" target=""_blank"">Mogwai</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"" target=""_blank"">Explosions in the Sky</a>, and any number of other tension-and-release junkies, but the music never broods. Instead, it powers sleekly along on economical drumming, taut, delay-heavy riffs, and chugging bass, a little like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4277-trans-am/"" target=""_blank"">Trans Am</a> with more focus. The economical drumming is especially key, and Mike Albanese handles the kit well after taking over for the late Jerry Fuchs, who played with the band from 2005 to his death in 2009. At the very least, he was well-briefed on what makes this band's music so effective-- their rhythmic template seems to be a head-on crash between the tightly disciplined, unerring work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>'s sequencers and drum machines and the looser, more human, but no less disciplined motorik beat of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"" target=""_blank"">Neu!</a>.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The album's extended transcendent peak comes on right in the middle, with the 10-minute-plus blast that is ""Abracadabracab"". The Genesis reference in the title is intentional-- the beat plays off a similar sequenced rhythm to the ones Genesis used on <i>Abacab</i>--<i> </i>and the song lives up to its own billing as modern-day prog rock with a groove. As it breaks down and builds back up, the band is always careful to keep pushing a forward motion. ""Solar Exodus"" is more explicitly electronic, layering Vocoder over buzzy electric sequencing, and a stomping funk beat. The band gets unusually heavy on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14185-earth-like/"" target=""_blank"">""Earth-Like""</a>, but for the most part, their spiraling guitars help keep breakneck burners like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13894-the-eliminator/"" target=""_blank"">""The Eliminator""</a> light on their feet.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i>VII</i> pursues no radical new directions for Maserati, but even though you sort of already know these songs, they still have enough engaging motion and kinetic force that if you ever loved them in the first place, you'll love them all over again here. The moment ""San Angeles"" kicks in with and adrenalized surge of guitar and thudding club beat, it's easy to feel as though you're along for this whole ride. <i>VII</i> is pretty much the sonic equivalent of being in the passenger seat with Bullitt.

It was released in 1989 on Independent Project Records by two English brothers, Mark and Clive Ives. <a href=""http://www.woo-music.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Their website</a> says they make ""Indie Electronic New Age for meditation, relaxation, yoga &amp; shiatsu."" Below the text, you can see them, the Ives brothers. One is wearing a dashiki; both are wearing what appear to be sailor hats. They are smiling big toothy smiles. ""Hi!"" the photo says. ""We're friendly!""</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30757-woo/"" target=""_blank"">Woo</a> have at least 10 albums; <i>It's Cosy Inside</i> is only one of four that I've heard, and the best, too; <i>A La Luna</i> is a close second. Though they were never attached to any particular scene, <i>It's Cosy Inside</i> can easily be connected to a whole subterranean history of quiet, gooey music: certain songs by the English folk/new-age band Penguin Café Orchestra, the audio collage project the Focus Group, the Krautrock/kosmische band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"" target=""_blank"">Cluster</a>, instrumental interludes by the opera composer Robert Ashley, the homebody sides of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28951-sun-araw/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Araw</a>, and several other more contemporary bands. Call it board-game psychedelia, maybe; armchair ambient.</p>
<p>""Ambient"" is a word usually used to describe albums that create wide-open spaces: the sky, the desert, the highway at night, etc. Even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>'s imagined airport-- from 1978's <i>Music for Airports-- </i>is a place of wide tunnels, high ceilings, and windows all around. The difference between Woo and most ambient music is scale: <i>It's Cosy Inside</i> is a domestic album whose map is drawn in its song titles: ""Wallpaper"", ""No More Telly"", ""End of the Attic"", ""It's Cosy Inside"". It gets as far as ""Downtown Suburbia"", then turns around (and note that this is downtown <i>suburbia</i>). But the album's limited imagined space is also what makes it so wonderful and disorienting: Like the second side of Animal Collective's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/191-sung-tongs/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sung Tongs</i></a>, <i>It's Cosy Inside</i> stakes itself on the premise that the most cosmic and revelatory experiences you'll ever have will all happen between your house and the backyard.</p>
<p>Most of it is made with acoustic guitars, gently strummed and run through effects pedals that make them sound slinky and liquid. Sometimes, clarinets come in. Melodies are pretty, sweet, almost sing-songy, but never assertive-- they ebb in, they ebb out. Knowing how little to play in situations like this is probably more important than knowing how much to play, and while there's never any silence on <i>It's Cosy Inside</i>, the album has a barely-there quality-- music as cobwebs, music as mist.</p>
<p>Music this strange certainly has the right to present itself as serious, mystical shit doing all kinds of serious, mystical investigation. It's to Woo's credit that they don't. Every level of <i>It's Cosy Inside</i><i>-- </i>from the cartoonish front cover to the song titles to the sound itself-- is chipper and inviting. They're just two smiling brothers in sailor hats making quiet guitar ooze for you to get massaged to. I first heard about them from the reliably interesting <a href=""http://mutant-sounds.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mutant Sounds</a> blog about five years ago. ""Hello,"" one of the post's comments read. ""This is my first ever blog-- how exciting to be talking to the computer-- we went to visit a crop circle last week just outside Barbury Castle in Wiltshire, and that was pretty exciting-- but this is-- Wow!!!!"" Crop circles, yeah-- ""pretty exciting."" The post, of course, was signed by Mark Ives-- half of Woo. </p></div>"|17263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17263-its-cosy-inside/|7.8|Mike Powell

Shirtless so as to expose the web of tattoos on his body, Death Grips frontman MC Ride stands with his back to the camera, his middle fingers foisted high and a cigarette tucked into his left hand. But he's balancing on a balcony, high up in what appears to be a rather well-furbished neighborhood, his toes hanging just over the ledge. He's tempting fate and taking the chance to make the strongest statement possible, even if he (and the photographer overhead) had to risk a fall to the death to get it. In fact, the only incident that might have given the riot-act release of <i>NO LOVE DEEP WEB</i> more currency in the media would have been an accidental death. At the very least, it would have kept at bay the conspiracy theorists calling Death Grips' Monday move a publicity stunt performed in conjunction with Epic Records. ""Too soon,"" you'd say.</p>
<p>At the risk of appearing moribund, that phenomenon of big stunts and instant exits largely defines <i>NO LOVE DEEP WEB</i>, not just in release style but also in musical makeup. These 13 tracks thrive on paranoia and aggression, feelings threaded together by the sense that everything could be ending right now. With his voice squeezed above a heavy thud and electro chirp, MC Ride rolls the dice again, as he did on the balcony's ledge: ""My life on a limb about to break."" Across these 46 minutes, Ride creates a series of <i>memento mori</i> scenarios (and even goes so far as to invoke that phrase) and dares them to destroy him. As he puts it, ""Fuck this world/ Fuck this body.""</p>
<p>The record's most obvious example is ""World of Dogs"", which opens with the repetitive hook ""It's all suicide"" over Zach Hill's death-jazz drums. Crushed by its own quest for redemption, the grueling pace and noose-necked premise-- ""Die with me/ Blow out the lights, take your life/ Ride the falling sky with me""-- make the song more grim than most black metal in 2012. The hook of ""Lil Boy"" is an invitation to burn brighter and faster, while the mortality-obsessed and especially corrosive ""Lock Your Doors"" includes a falling-from-life scream convincing enough to be sampled from a horror film. A minute later, Ride pictures the flame of a candle like the sand slipping through the hourglass: ""Light the candle, burn the wax/ Before me dies, in scorch uprise/ Can't deny it, no way back."" It's as if <i>NO LOVE DEEP WEB</i> was written and recorded knowing that its ultimate fate would either kill or catapult Death Grips. Essentially, the risk becomes the biggest reward.</p>
<p>After all, Death Grips' rage for some unnamed and very big system is written all across these tracks, and not just in the horror-house din of ""Lock Your Doors"" or the militaristic march of ""No Love"". MC Ride weaves networks of anxious and sometimes fatalistic visions; his phone's been tapped, and phantom footsteps sound just outside the door. At one point, he's stuck in a closed-circuit surveillance system, and he's the only one who can't watch. ""Tongue cut out the mouth of reason, and chucked off the river's edge,"" he manages in one particularly manic span, again acknowledging the end waiting just at the other side of the precipice.</p>
<p>He lashes out, becoming the bully with a vivid imagination and an aggressive lexicon. ""Lil Boy"" taunts the effete, while ""No Love"" (likely and hilariously Epic's would-have-been ""single"") teases the bloated form of stereotypical industry executives: ""Fuck do you do? Fuck a man with hips for hulu."" Ride buys up guns, threatens homicide, evades the law, pursues his prey, and, by his own admission, teeters toward the edge of crazy. He's most fierce on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14354-deep-web/"" target=""_blank"">""Deep Web""</a>, an industrial-strength boomer that finds him ready to fight and flee. ""I'm the coat hanger in your man's vagina,"" he stammers, unleashing a line vague enough to offend most everyone. It's the sort of thing you could imagine him shouting from the top of the balcony Sunday evening, spreading the bad news like heavy mortar fire. </p>
<p>With his schizoid panoply of voices and hyperlinked lyrics, MC Ride remains Death Grips' fountainhead and most polarizing figure. But the production of Zach Hill and Flatlander lives on the same line of danger as their leader. They afford Ride perfect platforms for his effrontery. Closer ""Artificial Death in the West"", for instance, is the longest track here, pushing toward the six-minute mark. Ride raps like he's stuck between failure and the future, so the music matches those ""hopeless premonitions"" with synthesizers suggesting krautrock tripping toward its own oblivion. ""Hunger Games"" explores a similar fascination with the end while the beat ruptures into ill-shaped bits. It's the sound of a troubled mind trying not to fall apart.</p>
<p>Loud and punishing, the sonics of <i>NO LOVE DEEP WEB</i> suit MC Ride's mix of hysteria, rage and exhaustion. Perhaps Epic has concerns about Death Grips' ability to make a marketable record; as Death Grips are arguably the most challenging act on a major label right now (or last week, at least), that much is founded. But their ability to integrate every part into cohesive tracks-- in other words, to marry their sound to their fury-- is rare. After a string of shows in the spring, Death Grips canceled all subsequent dates to finish <i>NO LOVE DEEP WEB</i>. That's a questionable career move, but the effort and attention show here at every turn.  </p>
<p>Death Grips exist within a cloud of hyperbole, from the maximized minimalism of their savage beats and the extreme unrest of their barked lyrics to the escalating gauntlet of their album covers and their blooming <a href=""http://amour-discipline.org/zine/death-grips-stick-their-cock-in-the-eye-of-sony-music/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">disregard</a> of industry standards. To summarize, <i>NO LOVE DEEP WEB-- </i>a record ostensibly paid for by a label owned by <a href=""http://www.sony.com/SCA/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one of the biggest companies in the world </a>but released for free on the Internet-- features an erect penis inked with the title in sloppy Sharpie script on its cover. One of its most undeniable hooks reads, ""She shoot pussy through your chest, you die."" Everything about this trio seems extreme.</p>
<p>Especially when perceived as posturing for publicity, those appearances make it difficult to realize and articulate the issues that Death Grips make so urgent. But this is a trio of itinerant transgressors, making impossible demands on the boundaries of rap and punk and rock'n'roll and questioning to the core not only what constitutes a proper release but also the standard models for turning music into money. For now, at least, <i>NO LOVE DEEP WEB</i> is an extraordinary outlier in most every sense, an album with no definitive home or home turf <a href=""http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/death-grips-top-bittorrent-s-list-of-most-1007965262.story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aside from the millions who will likely download it</a>. </p>
<p>So, are Death Grips publicity-crazed assholes who never saw a situation that couldn't be turned into a stunt, or are they real-life renegades who infiltrated the industry only to know they'd soon rip through its bowels? Frankly, at a time <a href=""http://instagram.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">when what's for dinner can become a cause for publicizing yourself</a>, and when <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2092674/Megaupload-fans-flock-rivals-Rapidshare-Hotfile-FBI-close-site.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one industry might shut down another</a> to restore historically accepted order, they're nothing if not a lot of both. For the second time in one year, both on a large label and on their own, they've released a record ruthless and rewarding enough to animate that image.  </p></div>"|17216.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17216-no-love-deep-web/|8.2|Grayson Currin

Dealing with Bergsman's travels through Pakistan, the resplendent record charmed my ears when it was released in 2009, but was ultimately lost amid the shuffle of ""bigger"" albums from that year.</p>
<p>The devotional, low-key, Sufi-infused folk album was a continent removed from Bergsman's previous efforts. She left the Concretes after 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1573-in-colour/"" target=""_blank"">In Colour</a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1573-in-colour/"" target=""_blank""></a></i> and her solo debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10370-open-field/"" target=""_blank""><i>Open Field</i></a>, produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4966-peter-bjorn-and-john/"" target=""_blank"">Peter, Bjorn &amp; John</a>'s Björn Yttling, fell well within the Concretes' range of folky indie pop. But with her vocal talents being deployed in many an ad campaign as the female foil for the whistling zeitgeist of ""Young Folks"", and for her pillow-murmured read of ""Sweet Child o' Mine"", Bergsman's fans ran the risk of being killed softly by that voice. On <i>Eden</i>, Bergman expanded her reach considerably, working with working with local Pakistani players and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5126-studio/"" target=""_blank"">Studio</a>'s Dan Lissvik, as well as including a guest appearance from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Panda Bear</a>. And more importantly, it sprung her from the meticulous and pristine confines of Scandinavian indie pop.</p>
<p>On Taken by Trees' calming and ocean-breeze-gentle <i>Other Worlds</i>, Bergsman sounds comfy as both world citizen and globetrotter. This go-round, she trekked down to the Hawaiian Islands, no doubt a more restful destination than Pakistan. And the resultant album sounds like someone who is taking a vacation from their vacation. ""I know a place where you can go/ Where you can get back on your feet, boy,"" she whispers on the first single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13874-dreams/"" target=""_blank"">""Dreams""</a>, sounding like the most sylphlike of travel agents on one of the season's most choice Balearic numbers.</p>
<p>Bergsman, working here with producer Henning Fürst (of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5358-the-tough-alliance/"" target=""_blank"">the Tough Alliance</a>), cites the Beach Boys' instrumental ""Diamond Head"" and an Augustus Pablo song as inspiration for the record, both of which are obvious from the opening ""Horizon"", wherein washes of Pacific Ocean tides, Tiki-drink percussion, and gentle analog synth sounds all eddy about Bergsman's voice as she sings of missing the sight of her beloved's face. ""Keeping it real, as real as it gets,"" she sings on ""Highest High"", sounding as unwound as could be, as if she's swinging from a hammock down in Margaritaville, watching a rainstorm between slats of bamboo. There's a gentle sway to the song, intertwining some Pablo-esque melodica with <a href=""http://farmerdavescher.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Farmer Dave Scher</a>'s keening pedal steel, one of the album's secret weapons.</p>
<p>After the first three songs, the album sags ever so slightly, as a tropical torpor settles over the first half of the disc. But by the time ""Large"" comes up, the pace quickens just enough, a disco-dub beat propelling things along, with some stabbing strings and steel guitar glissades livening the track. And the rippling instrumental of ""Indigo Dub"" is a lovely interlude. At times Bergsman's childlike voice reminds me of the naïf sound of former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2865-mum/"" target=""_blank"">múm</a> singer Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir and the Nico-esque intonation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29484-peaking-lights/"" target=""_blank"">Peaking Lights</a>' Indra Dunis, yet Taken By Trees' intent feels ever so slightly different from those two. There's a trace of desire and the wobbly knees of newfound love to be gleaned in Bergsman's voice, cooing, ""Baby, I want you all the time,"" on ""I Want You"".</p>
<p>A caucasian girl going down to the Tropics is definitely not a new musical trope, but the winsome <i>Other Worlds</i> does strike a balance between two similar efforts: Brenda Ray's <i>Walatta</i> and Lizzy Mercier Descloux's <i>Mambo Nassau</i>. In the former, a British post-punker recorded laidback takes over old reggae riddims, where on the latter, a French no-waver trekked down to the Bahamas to put a decidedly spiky spin on Kool and the Gang, calypso, and Bob Marley. Staying on just this side of a Corona beer commercial, it sounds like a continuation of Bergsman's realizations carried over from <i>East of Eden</i>, in that a change in latitude brings about a change in attitude.</p></div>"|17130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17130-other-worlds/|7.6|Andy Beta

Falsini has called various places home during his career, including his native Italy and London. But his greatest spell of creativity came in a home studio he put together in a basement in Virginia after moving to the United States in 1969. Naturally, that made him something of a trailblazer in the art of home recording, and his fondness for innovation, for exploring curious notions, for defying expectations, extended deeply into the music he made. The word that commonly comes to mind when listening to this work, compiled by <a href=""http://igetrvng.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RVNG</a> from five Sensations' Fix albums, one Falsini solo record, and a series of unreleased outtakes, is ""free."" This work embraces a range of styles, including prog, kosmische musik, trad-rock, ambient, and psychedelia.  </p>
<p>The open-ended approach Falsini took to his art makes it difficult to easily classify Sensations' Fix, but the disparate nature of his output is also a big part of the appeal. Anyone randomly picking up an album by the band could be transported into one of many worlds. Falsini's 1975 solo album, <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/release/SP+014"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cold Nose</i></a>, was allegedly a soundtrack to a film about cocaine. Excerpts from it are included here, although no tangible evidence of the film's existence is forthcoming. Most of their music is instrumental and heavy on the electronics Falsini was obsessing over at the time, but there are also curios like the vocal-and-guitar driven prog-stodge of ""Barnhause Effect"" (from <i>Vision's Fugitives</i>) that opens this collection. In 1974, the band's label, Polydor, ended up releasing three Sensations' Fix albums in one year, partly due to the unusual contract Falsini had signed with them. Clearly this is a group that left a delirious trail of orchestrated and accidental confusion in its wake.</p>
<p>That kind of nonsensical approach, bombarding people with myriad stylistic turns over a brief span of time, explains why it's taken so long for listeners to grasp this music. Only after the dust settled did Sensations' Fix get their dues, primarily through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1113-dj-shadow/"">DJ Shadow</a> sampling them on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2373-the-private-press/"">The Private Press</a></i>,<i> </i>but also in a gallery retrospective curated by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>, and via <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Daniel Lopatin</a> dropping a track by the band into a <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2010/06/28/fact-mix-162-oneohtrix-point-never/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FACT mix</a>. What's striking about <i>Music Is Painting in the Air</i> is how easily you can trace the central aesthetic of many future bands and genres through it. The bass-heavy ""Left Side of Green"" bears the spidery cadence of post rock; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13804-dark-side-of-religion/"">""Dark Side of Religion""</a> is an unnervingly precise proto-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a> cut; ""Cold Nose Story"" acts as a precursor to the fuzzy yearnings of Bristolians <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1524-flying-saucer-attack/"">Flying Saucer Attack</a>; ""Fortune Teller"" predates Ben Chasny's astral-folk projections as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3807-six-organs-of-admittance/"">Six Organs of Admittance</a> by many decades.</p>
<p>It might be a stretch to cast Falsini as some kind of indie rock soothsayer, but it's clear from this collection that he was testing out ground that would later be explored in a great deal of depth. He was never satisfied to run in place, to root the Sensations' Fix sound in one of many areas that was then (and, in some cases, still is now) ripe for exploration. Partly that can be explained by the era in which he was working. Falsini's liner notes explain how he was one of the first musicians to gain access to the MiniMoog, which he describes as ""a tool to forward our sound into the future."" That Falsini never had a clear idea what his own musical ""future"" held is both his biggest strength and weakness. A greater exploration of the echo-y loops that make up ""Moving Particles"" could surely have led to a moment of inspiration not far from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5842-manuel-gottsching/"">Manuel Göttsching</a>'s <i>E2-E4</i>. The fact that he didn't get there, choosing many other avenues to explore instead, led him to somewhere incredibly fractured but no less fascinating.</p>
<p>There are no easy inroads into the Sensations' Fix sound-- something this compilation neatly addresses by laying everything out in a self-confessed ""arbitrary yet inspired"" non-chronological order. The approach to pulling everything together for <i>Music Is Painting in the Air</i> was as anarchic as the spirit in which it was conceived, leading to tracks like ""Crossing Berlin"", a pulse-heavy Arp odyssey that resembles an offcut from the <i>Midnight Express </i>soundtrack, nestling next to a series of broody electronics in the form of the ""Darkside"" trilogy from the <i>Finest Finger</i>/<i>Vision's Fugitives</i> era. There were, of course, some peers of this band. Occasionally their work brings to mind the mix of plastic pop, whimsy, electronics, and psychedelia spliced together by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4440-united-states-of-america/"">United States of America</a>. Elsewhere, the understated work of krautrock legends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a> can easily be traced. But this is the world of a singular, often quite nutty talent, who created a puzzle whose secrets may never be fully unlocked.</p></div>"|17157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17157-music-is-painting-in-the-air/|7.8|Nick Neyland

But that's not the only reason these songs sound instantly familiar. The bands they've been compared to are somewhat more telling, although none fits exactly. A little more sashay and they'd be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30306-polica/"" target=""_blank"">Poliça</a>; more rapture and they'd be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Florence</a>; throw in some trolling and they'd be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"">Lana</a>. Their closest analogue, in fact, might be Toni Halliday's solo project Chatelaine, even if ""Bones"" didn't so closely echo their ""Broken Bones"". Every song is steeped in gloom, yet not so much as to sully their hooks. Plapinger's vocals are shaded brittle, confident, or spooky as is called for. She'll turn a folk curtsy for a sparrow metaphor, strut her melisma through a verse like the Sugababes' Siobhan Donaghy, or give up words entirely; the one commonality is that they're always a shade too vulnerable, too clear in a busy mix, or too hesitant where she'd otherwise be belting. She's the figure lit like a spotlight amid the dusk, lost but compelling.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This effect works best when the lyrics merit such illumination, as on ""Hurricane"", the band's breakout and the most fully formed track here. The strings are churning up something, specifically a relationship wrecked out of fear. ""Welcome to the inner workings of my mind, so dark and foul I can't disguise,"" Plapinger sings, and if it's melodramatic, the fog of reverb certainly backs her up. There's more levity on ""Ash Tree Lane"", a march set to brass and a wordless hook that'd be exuberant in any other context, but then Plapinger gets to singing again about plagues and wrong choices, eventually cutting the whole thing off with a gasp after--again-- ""my mind's a mess."" ""Bones"" isn't as strong; the pile of fractured guitar and strings works well enough, but it's unclear whether ""dark twisted fantasy"" is a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a> reference (or whether it'd be preferable if so), and the lyrical admission ""marinate in misery like a girl of only 17"" doesn't excuse the clichés of teenage misery: empty churches, broken dreams paired with silent screams, madness paired with sadness.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A good way to tell whether a group's succeeding on style or substance is to see how they handle a concept that could be bigger than them. On <i>Candy Bar Creep Show</i>, that's ""Dark Doo Wop"", a title that might as well have been kept on reserve behind glass labeled ""Break in Case of Aesthetic Drought"". The throughline is simple, a mainstay of pop through the ages: This world is gonna <i>burn</i>, so you might as well stick around. It's simple enough to execute, too; all you need are a few diffident doo-wops and coquetry on ""that's my man,"" and as for the part where the world burn, burn, burns, the juxtaposition's obvious on its own. But it only <i>works</i> if it's delivered with a preacher's passion, or at least with Skeeter Davis' pathos. MS MR deliver, ratcheting up the rapture to near-thunderstorm levels: seething percussion, steely vocals, and a sonic fog that buries any lingering pleasantries.</p></div>"|17234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17234-candy-bar-creep-show/|7.4|Katherine St. Asaph

With artists this prolific it is never certain how long any particular collaboration or project will last; and in 2010 when the three released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14249-false-flag/"" target=""_blank""><i>False Flag</i></a>, their debut as <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/artists/rangda"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rangda</a>, it was not immediately clear if this was to be a one-off album or the work of an ongoing group. But musicians with this much experience are also able to recognize when they've struck upon a special combination, and their second album <i>Formerly Extinct</i> confirms Rangda to be an active, cohesive band of the highest caliber.</p>
<p>In retrospect, <i>False Flag</i> sounds like a bit of a feeling-out process, as the three musicians, each with his own well-established voice, blast noisy improvisations and rifle through ideas as they learn how best to mesh their eccentric styles. On <i>Formerly Extinct</i> that process is completed, and Rangda sounds like a band that knows exactly who they are and what they want to do together. Forgoing noisier digressions, every track on the album is taut and sinewy, with the musicians listening to one another and anticipating each other's moves as if they were sharing limbs. For now at least, Rangda have settled into a sound that seems very much an idealized hybrid between Six Organs of Admittance and the more song-oriented moments of Sun City Girls, with the album performing the weird magic trick of sounding about as you might expect it to while still being filled with surprises.</p>
<p>For Sir Richard Bishop, whose work as a solo artist and with the Sun City Girls, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/underscore/8935-sun-city-girls/"" target=""_blank"">as summarized by Marc Masters</a>, has continually defied all possible boundaries, <i>Formerly Extinct</i> might be one of his most straightforward and song-centered albums to date. Even ""Silver Nile"", the album's lone long-form piece, is crafted with an entrancing, slowly unwinding melody as Chasny's and Bishop's guitars patiently circling one another like a pair of desert vultures. As is always the case with Bishop's work, vague Eastern and North African echoes abound on such tracks as ""Idol's Eye"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14050-majnun/"" target=""_blank"">""Majnun""</a>, with Chasny able to match whatever accent Bishop chooses to adopt.</p>
<p>There have always been two main risks whenever such veteran improvisational musicians as these play together: Either someone will tend to hog the ball while the other players are reduced to the role of mere accompanists, or else everyone will be so disinclined to step on each other's toes that nobody actually makes any memorable moves at all. The most remarkable thing about Rangda, then, is their music's balance. No one player ever dominates any given song, and whenever either Chasny or Bishop steps forward to take a solo, the other works with Corsano to keep things continually engaging in the background.</p>
<p>Whenever a trio is able to achieve a balance like that, it usually means there is some world-class drumming going on, and that is the case with Corsano on <i>Formerly Extinct</i>. Rangda's songs are oddly built creatures, filled with enough abrupt time changes and strange meters for me to wonder if any of this might qualify as math-rock. Throughout the album Corsano is able to keep everything moving so deftly his playing seems almost nonchalant, his rhythms continually churning and roiling but never sounding particularly flashy or show-offish.</p>
<p>As satisfying as <i>Formerly Extinct</i> sounds, it also drops a few tantalizing hints of what might still be to come from Rangda. On ""Tres Hambres"", with its sly nod to ZZ Top, Chasny and Bishop volley a circular riff back and forth between the speakers with a dazzling ease, and on the brief ""Goodbye Mr. Gentry"", I can't help but get visions of classic Minutemen songs in my head, and it leads me to wish for a track or two where these guys fuel the amps and rip into a straight 4/4 psych-rock monster closer to what Chasny does with his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Comets on Fire</a> crew. But that's just me getting greedy; for now it's enough to know that, with <i>Formerly Extinct</i>, Rangda not only prove themselves to be a going concern as a band, but that they might just be starting to really hit their stride.</p></div>"|17166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17166-formerly-extinct/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

He showed up armed with a guitar, an endearing croon that is both virtuosic and everyman, a coiffed haircut, and a slightly retro sensibility. His voice is an elastic thing that's rarely used to excessive effect; he avoids the histrionic R. Kelly worship of so many of his compatriots in favor of the school of smooth Sam Cooke ad-libs. And though his lyrics are full of silly puns and earnest platitudes, he takes sex very seriously: He's a happily-married man in a genre full of lascivious bachelors, and his best music radiates maturity, self-assured and confident but rarely showy. But despite his obvious talent, he hasn't quite been able to break through to a wider audience.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Miguel's 2010 debut album, <i>All I Want Is You</i>, was flanked with some stellar singles but weighed down by a lack of identity as he flitted from producer to producer. It sounded like he couldn't decide whether he wanted to be a Salaam Remi faux-nostalgia crooner or a smart hip-hop crossover star, and the indecision hung over the record like a cloud (it didn't perform well commercially either). He returned earlier this year with a free trio of EPs under the self-conscious title of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16571-art-dealer-chic-vols-1-3/"" target=""_blank"">Art Dealer Chic</a></i>,<i> </i>showing a newfound entrepreneurial sensibility and a streak of independence. Those mostly self-produced songs at times sounded like rough sketches, but they made it up for it by sounding personal and liberated from the demands of the industry. Free and widely available, they earned him some well-deserved re-examination. They also contained his best songs to date. And now, with his second full-length, he's delivered on that early promise. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Kaleidoscope Dream</i> starts off with ""Adorn"", also found on the first <i>Art Dealer Chic</i> EP. It's one of the giddiest love songs of the year, a track where ecstatic infatuation is hemmed in by Miguel's understated vocal dexterity, and this album feels like its proper context. He rockets off into falsetto for irresistibly brief moments, and a new outro spirals elegant, trained vocal gymnastics around the song's chorus. ""Adorn"" also showcases Miguel's secret weapon: modesty. It's definitively, deceptively simple, a nugget of concentrated sunshine, and not necessarily all that original. But I'll be damned if it doesn't pull you in and make you feel it. </p>
<p class=""p1"">That touch of modesty colors most of <i>Kaleidoscope Dream</i>. There's the tender <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13969-use-me/"" target=""_blank"">""Use Me""</a> where he admits being nervous about having sex with the lights on. Even more affecting is the acoustic murmur ""Pussy Is Mine"", which deflates masculinized hip-hop tropes with insecurity, pleading, ""Tell me that the pussy is mine/ 'Cause I don't wanna believe that anyone is just like me."" The sentiment turns sardonic on the Ryan Leslie-like jaunt of ""How Many Drinks?"", where gorgeous falsetto verses are offset by uncertain pleas of ""I don't wanna waste my time."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">The plush, lightly psychedelic production buffers the record's more barebones moments, and Miguel's precocious vocals take flight on the bombast rather than drowning in it. Standout ""Do You..."" unfolds in an ethereal cloud of synth, voices streaming like angelic choirs before stumbling into a verse buoyed by its own euphoria. Not many singers could get away with lines like ""What about matinee movies/ Pointless secrets/ Midnight summer swim, private beaches/ Rock, paper, scissors/ Wait! best outta three!"" It's the stuff of unbearable rom-com montages, but Miguel's playful delivery brings it over. He's the rare vocalist who makes you <i>feel</i> what he's singing about, even when his lyrics can be transparent. When he wants to sound deadly serious, he's on the verge of tears; when he's happy, he's practically laughing as he sings.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Kaleidoscope Dream</i> has elements of the sort of tasteful R&amp;B record that the Grammys love, but much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15585-4/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé's <i>4</i></a>, it cuts through its own statuesque stateliness with raw emotion reined in by an ever-present sense of professionalism. And it succeeds in part because it sounds like Miguel's album and no one else's. There are no intrusive guest appearances, and the record sounds even less of its time than the first, reveling in its own contextual vacuum with abandon. Though there are some unexpected choices. Like ""Don't Look Back"", which is propped up by grand synth runs before melting into an interpolation of the Zombies' ""Time of the Season"". That song's musky psychedelia is a good example of the record's overarching theme, the highly sexualized seen through the lens of the eager and innocent. </p>
<p class=""p1"">When Miguel isn't accompanied by glossy synths, the music is all about intimacy. Take ""Arch &amp; Point""-- with a simple rasp, strum, and metronome, it sounds like it was recorded in the very bedroom it's ostensibly taking place in. ""When it feels this good then it just comes natural,"" he insists, and there's not a better ethos for where his career stands at this point. Emerging unscathed from middling mainstream performance, <i>Kaleidoscope Dream</i> sounds, at its utmost, natural and easy, an artist set free to do what he wants and proving himself every bit the unique voice his debut seemed to deny. It's respectful of tradition, quietly ambitious, and deeply personal, a wonderfully considered album from an artist who was starting to seem a lot like a forgotten gem in the wake of mishandled promotion.</p></div>"|17125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17125-kaleidoscope-dream/|8.4|Andrew Ryce

Ross, as pretty much everyone who pays attention to these things now knows, broke the myth of the authentic rapper: When 50 Cent aired him out as a former correctional officer, it merely freed Ross up to tell larger, more grandiose stories about a worldwide drug operation that he clearly wasn't running. Now, according to sources like Hot 97's Peter Rosenberg, Ross is the most important rapper making music today.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Jeezy is the more old-line model of gangster rapper, so much so that Jay-Z, on his song ""A Star is Born"", credited him and his crew with ""reminding me of us in early '92."" Unfortunately for Jeezy, that kind of authenticity-based gangster rap is less popular than ever. Since 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9711-the-inspiration/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Inspiration</i></a>, he's struggled to appeal to a mainstream audience without help from marquee names like Usher and Kanye West.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">If Jeezy represents a part of the gangster-rap spectrum that's fallen off in recent years, his cohort and label signee <a href=""http://www.freddiegibbs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Freddie Gibbs</a> is making music that skews even closer to pop radio obsolescence. The people who control pop radio have, in large part, moved on. Thankfully, a rapper like Gibbs could give a shit about all that. With his new mixtape <i>Baby Face Killa</i>,<i> </i>Gibbs has perfected the formula that has made him a blog favorite for the past few years.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This type of gangster rap has become a formalized subgenre, as familiar and rigidly structured as a mob movie. There are tropes that simply must be included, beats that must be hit. Here, instead of the montage of the rise, the femme fatale, the deal gone wrong, the traitor in our midst, there are simpler traditions: the song about weed, the song about money, clothes and hoes, the gang song. On <i>Baby Face Killa</i>, all are executed to perfection.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Let's start with the song about money, clothes, and hoes, which is called ""Money, Clothes, Hoes (MCH)"", the second-most generic track name of all time, after ""Gangsta Shit"". But with claims lobbied like ""gangster of the year, got that like four times in a row"" over swirling keys and an addictive, chant-along chorus, the song title is besides the point. ""My Nigga"", is the gang song, one of many (possibly subconscious) tributes to classic 90s rap. It sounds like a great, unearthed Outlawz track, on which Freddie channels Tupac like no one else can. Producers Cookin' Soul summon an automobile clatter as Freddie bellows that ""we all sinners, may God save us,"" extending his vowels like the late Mr. Shakur. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Tupac isn't the only legend given his due on the tape. Z-Ro, a rap demigod in his own right, does a more-than-passable imitation of Nate Dogg on the fantastic ""Boxframe Cadillac ('83 Deville Mix)"". ""Even if it's raining, I'ma still drop the top,"" he sings. ""That's some of the silly shit niggas do when they at the top."" Freddie himself seems to want this tape to be seen as a direct descendant of the classics. ""Walk in Wit the M.O."" builds off of LL Cool J's ""Around the Way Girl"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14285-kush-cloud-ft-krayzie-bone-and-spaceghostpurrp/"" target=""_blank"">""Kush Cloud""</a>, the weed song that fittingly features Krayzie Bone, has a direct allusion to ""Thug Luv"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">But <i>Baby Face Killa </i>isn't some artifact dug up from the past. ""Kush Cloud"" also features an effective turn from youngster <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29688-spaceghostpurrp/"" target=""_blank"">Spaceghostpurrp</a>, and album standout ""Bout It Bout It"" wouldn't work half so well without the syrupy flow of the hard-charging Houstonite Kirko Bangz. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a> lends a verse to the fitting sequel to ""Scottie Pippen"", the flow-seminar ""Tell a Friend"", on which both rappers show off their agility, Gibbs flicking syllables around like marbles, Curren$y stuffing extra words in as if the beat had bottomless pockets. I often compare Gibbs to Curren$y in that the two are so consistent that, when weighing whether or not to listen to their projects, you're best served investigating the merit of producers and guest spots present. These two guys just don't screw up, and when those two factors are together, they always come up gold.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But Gibbs, though he can't carry an entire 18-track tape by himself (flow too regulated and relatively unmelodic) has no trouble bearing the weight of individual songs. He holds nothing back on the paranoia prima beat of ""Still Livin'"", saying that he's ""still living like a jack boy, got your family wrapped up in tape, I'm 'bout that sack, boy."" Meanwhile, on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14179-the-hard-ft-dana-williams/"" target=""_blank"">""The Hard""</a>, we get yet another heartless, unglamorous portrait of what a street dealer's life is like. That's what you're going to get from Freddie Gibbs. There's no excess; the fat's all stripped away and any kind of celebration is a form of catharsis, that beer that you need after a long day after work instead of a gratuitous 10 bottles of Ace of Spades. If the car isn't an '83 Caddie, we just imagine that it is. Fuck a defunct Maybach.  </p>
<p class=""p2"">I'm happy that Rick Ross happened. Besides the fact that Ross is a great rapper in his own right, authenticity was always a bad joke and a particularly ugly thing to care about when questionable rappers were trading on ""realness"" to get publicity that they wouldn't have gotten if they were kids from the burbs spitting one syllable words over huge trap beats. But there should never be a monopoly or monarchy in rap-- too much of anything is always a bad thing. And with <i>Baby Face Killa</i>, Freddie Gibbs restores some of the balance, not because of any perceived authenticity or realness, but because he's very, very good at performing within a genre that will soon be extinct or will otherwise evolve into something unrecognizable.</p></div>"|17235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17235-baby-face-killa/|8.2|Jonah Bromwich

""I didn't see the point of doing shows because it seemed like nonsense for me being the centre of attention for 30 or 45 minutes,"" <a href=""http://whiteheatmagazine.wordpress.com/2011/09/10/menace-ruine/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she explained in a 2011 interview</a>. ""Isn't it a little pretentious, or even dangerous, to expose yourself like this?"" And three years before, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/7527-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">in an interview with Pitchfork</a>, she aspired to a new way of transcendence that cast the world itself behind a shadow of oblivion: ""The ideal would be to live on a strictly energetic plane... My way is to put distance between me and the world and allow myself not to be there, to live more on what is coming from the inside with the least earthly preoccupations possible.""</p>
<p>Echoes of those ideas-- breaking the cycle of human existence to explore alternative ways to be born, to live and to die-- cycle throughout <i>Alight in Ashes</i>, the fourth album from the Montreal pair of Beaulieu and instrumentalist S. de La Moth. ""Now I am ready to let go of things and those that I have loved in my life,"" she sings during album closer ""Cup of Oblivion"", her voice suddenly soaring. Elsewhere, she explores the creation myth of the salamander, an animal once purported to be born of fire, and how accepted ideas of what living means are certainly fallible-- ""You've proved that souls don't burn in Hell,"" she offers. </p>
<p>But with Menace Ruine, such ideas take shape off the page, too. Across the album's 62 minutes, a deluge of carefully ordered sounds creates a mesmerizing tide of music. Guitars, keyboards, drums, and drum machines weave together horizontally, forming a dynamic canvas through which Beaulieu's beautiful voice dips and crests. With its glowing tones ordered into hypnotic arrays, <i>Alight in Ashes</i> suggests something of a ritual, with Beaulieu presiding over the doctrines like a priestess. It's immersive and transfixing, tones dangling as lures to woo you into whatever lifestyle Beaulieu proselytizes. During ""Arsenikon (Faded in Discord)"", she lands upon a mantra concerning the scourges of worldly worry: ""Eroded, moldering away/ Flowing out of our own body/ Evil expels evil,"" she sings, her clipped vocals cycling through a loop that stretches and shrinks syllables and time. Nested above a surging bed of noise, those vocal circles wrap into an unavoidable vortex. You want in. And though Beaulieu stays silent during the instrumental ""Burnt Offerings"", its submerged organ melody and underlying growl of guitar noise work as opiates, offering the same sort of hypnosis as Nurse with Wound or Tony Conrad's Joan of Arc. On <i>Alight in Ashes</i>, Menace Ruine's dark beauty beckons without pause or fail.</p>
<p>Even at its most aggressive (opener ""Set Water to Flames"" flashes out in a wall of sound backed by heavy military drums) or slightest (see the simply distorted whorls during ""Disease of Fear""), every sound on <i>Alight in Ashes</i> feels of a piece. Beaulieu and de la Moth create and sustain an atmosphere that becomes its own spotlight and, indeed, seems whisked away from the rest of the world. Menace Ruine first emerged with links to several cadres of bands, from black metal or new age to power electronics or astral folk. They retain qualities of all those realms, whether in black metal's obsessive saturation or Beaulieu's singing, which seems like a readymade female foil for Current 93's David Tibet. But the real success of <i>Alight in Ashes</i> isn't that it is doubtlessly Menace Ruine's most singular and identifiable synthesis of those strains to date, but that, when the record is playing, outside factors like influences and contemporaries seem momentarily too distant to consider.  </p></div>"|17127.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17127-alight-in-ashes/|7.7|Grayson Currin

The Chicago-based producer is inextricably tied to his hometown's faster-than-fast and repetitive genre of footwork; Davis is one of the producers linked with Chicago's Flight Musik collective, which is headed up by DJ Diamond, who issued a solid footwork album under that name on UK label Planet Mu. That imprint has spent the last several years making a case for footwork as a genre that transcends functional dance music, in part through their <i>Bangs &amp; Works</i> compilation series; Davis contributed two songs, ""Psycho War"" and ""Wouldn't Get Far"", to last year's second installment. Both fit nicely within footwork's sonic constraints; the former is all cinematic strings and maniacal metallic-popcorn percussion, while the latter rides an inspired vocal lick and throws it through various levels of filter.</p>
<p>Given his background, it's understandable to think of Davis as a footwork producer, but <i>Space Zone</i> is something different. The record finds Davis using the genre as a launchpad into weirder territory. The brown-sound frequencies and tightly looped rhythms are still present, but they're placed lower in the mix to dampen their intensity. On a few tracks, you barely notice that they're there at all. <i>Space Zone </i>also shows that Davis has a neon-streaked sense of humor. The title track features a warm, melodic voice intoning, ""Welcome to the space zone,"" as lasers and video-game explosions bounce off of rubbery walls. Elsewhere, you get claustrophobic klaxons, blastoff noises, launchpad countdowns, and robotic voices issuing warnings about ""countermeasures."" After a particularly stoner-friendly run of cuts on the album's backend, a more traditional footwork number arrives in the form of ""High Den a Mother Fucka"". Its title underscores the fact that the target audience for this thing probably wouldn't be able to move their feet very fast without doubling into a wheezing cough.</p>
<p><i>Space Zone</i>'s closest analog in modern dance music may be Zomby's epochal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12543-where-were-u-in-92/"" target=""_blank""><i>Where Were U in '92?</i></a>,  trading that album's 'ardcore fixation with a focus on hard-hitting juke. Both records showcase a freewheeling ADD-addled sense of speed, with idiosyncratic sounds peppered throughout to keep it fresh. So it's ironic that Davis' most intriguing work comes when he slows things down, from the placid synths and drippy rhythmic squelch of ""Space Breeze"" to the dreamy synth drift of ""Liquid Drug"". Here Boards of Canada is the obvious comparison, not so much in actual form but in how he creates cloudy billows of atmosphere that retain a basic level of engagement.</p>
<p>Davis is young and <i>Space Zone</i> sounds like the work of a young artist. A <i>promising</i> young artist, but someone still figuring out his own sound. I've spoken with others about how this record compares to another Planet Mu release from this year from within Chicago's juke scene-- veteran Traxman's hallucinatory, melody-minded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16530-the-mind-of-traxman/"" target=""_blank""><i>Da Mind of Traxman</i></a>. But ultimately these releases have different aims. While Traxman's expression of songcraft matches and, at times, exceeds the speedy pop burps of DJ Roc's excellent 2010 release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14868-da-trak-genious-the-crack-capone/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Crack Capone</i></a>, Young Smoke's not trying to push things forward. Instead, he's trying to take the genre somewhere it hasn't really gone yet, by introducing new textures, giving his productions more space and room to breathe, and infusing the results with a dose of humor. Whether or not he gets there remains to be seen, but joining him on the ride provides its own level of fascination. </p></div>"|17196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17196-space-zone/|7.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

And that was before Billie Joe Armstrong's onstage tirade forced him to check into substance-abuse treatment. If <a href=""http://seapony.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seapony</a> were to land a revealingly complementary, high-profile opening slot of their own, it would have to be for the xx. This Seattle-based, flyover-country-bred band's Hardly Art debut, last year's<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15412-go-with-me/"" target=""_blank""><i> Go With M</i>e</a>, showed a similar commitment to intimacy and understatement. But where the influential British trio draws more from club-oriented sounds, Seapony unshowily and agreeably extend a wispy, reverb-prone indie pop tradition that spans from Marine Girls, Young Marble Giants, and Talulah Gosh to the Field Mice or the Softies and on through the 21st-century likes of the Postmarks, Headlights, and Tennis. If you happen to have an itch for a specific kind of yearning, autumn-sunset guitar-pop-- which, admittedly, I do-- well, this should scratch it nicely.</p>
<p>Recorded again at home, the 12-song, 36-minute effort refines the simple style Seapony set out on first <i>Go With Me</i> single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12039-dreaming/"" target=""_blank"">""Dreaming""</a>, now with additional polish courtesy of the mixers at Olympia's Dub Narcotic Studios. The core duo of Jenny Weidl and Danny Rowland trade off on flickering, Smiths-meets-Ventures guitar leads and strums that are either jangly or distorted (or both), as their longtime friend Ian Brewer adds unassuming basslines, over drum tracks that this time are more organic-sounding. Even the relatively uptempo tracks, like the not-so-patiently-waiting neo-psych strummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13707-what-you-wanted/"" target=""_blank"">""What You Wanted""</a> or thumping sadsack's lament ""Never Be"", have a satisfingly misty quality. And when Seapony fine-tune their muted palette-- whether with the screeching sound effects on the credulous ""Be My Baby""-beat ""Tell Me So"" or the more direct, confident vocals on acoustic-leaning ""See Me Cry""-- it mostly works.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if the album title carries over to the lyrics, which are written and quietly sung by Weidl, love isn't all that's being fallen into. Sure, ""Follow"" plays winsomely with the homophonic closeness between ""fall for you"" and ""follow you,"" but the languid ""Fall Apart"" is a reverb-sprawled reverie on <i>lost</i> love. Lyrical mentions of ""falling"" stretch, too, to the atmospheric, drum-machine-centered ""Be Alone""-- except here it's more like falling through space, as Weidl sings that ""everyone would rather be alone."" It'd certainly be fair to call <i>Falling</i> low-stakes, and it's also fair to long a bit for songs that are somewhat more distinctive, moods that are less uniform. But in the world of bedroom loners suggested here, outside opinions might not be especially relevant-- and, in fact, could be missing the point.</p>
<p>Thus, the key track, the sneakily catchy ""No One Will"", which approaches the same question from a different angle: ""It took forever to find somebody/ It took forever to leave this room/ What can we do?"" Whether meeting a lover or growing an audience, <i>Falling</i> suggests, you can't change where you're coming from. To Seapony's credit and perhaps slight detriment, their essence so far is subdued pleasure; they might not go crazy for you, but they know the only place for themselves almost too well.</p></div>"|17028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17028-falling/|6.6|Marc Hogan

The group consists of Godrich and Los Angeles-based producer/drummer Joey Waronker, who've worked together on and off since Beck's 1998 album <i>Mutations</i>, including time in the Thom Yorke's side project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28660-atoms-for-peace/"" target=""_blank"">Atoms for Peace</a>. Vocalist Laura Bettinson, whom they recruited after seeing a loop-heavy performance from her electronic pop project Dimbleby &amp; Capper, rounds out the band.</p>
<p>Those with knowledge of these artists' CVs won't have much trouble hearing their individual contributions to <i>Ultraísta</i>'s smooth, krautrock-indebted synth pop. Waronker's tumbling rhythms are central, while Bettinson's layered vocals weave easily through and around the viscous synths. But it's ultimately Godrich's show, as <i>Ultraísta</i>'s electronic squiggles and tight production bring to mind his work on Yorke's own solo set, 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9183-the-eraser/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Eraser</i></a>. Yorke's album had a distinctly gloomy, threatening tone, and <i>Ultraísta</i> feels similarly hermetic and overcast. </p>
<p>Over the course of the record, <i>Ultraísta</i>'s atmospheric consistency turns out to be its biggest flaw. Almost every track adheres to the same formula: a complicated drum pattern to open followed by some synths or treated piano and then by Bettinson's voice, which is progressively looped and layered until the track's end. Once you've heard one of these songs, you've heard the entire record. And the dullness is driven home by Bettinson's voice, which is competent but lacks distinctiveness. Here and there she shows some versatility, like when she mixes a whisper with a holler on ""Bad Insect"" and conveys palpable desperation through on ""Our Song"". But generally, her smoky vocals sound cut-and-pasted from one of those chillout compilations that's clogged up many a used-CD music store section. She's not really saying much lyrically, either; the album's lyrics were collaboratively written by the trio, and as such they possess a factory-churned facelessness, consisting mostly of clichéd imagery and weightless invocations of passion.</p>
<p>To focus too much on <i>Ultraísta</i>'s words, however, is missing the point. The group's clearly more concerned with making great sounds and creating a distinctive vibe than they are with making lasting statements. Taking that into consideration, <i>Ultraísta</i> succeeds on its own low-stakes terms. But while listening to it, I couldn't help but think about another album from a side project spawned by a high-profile British musician-- this year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16697-recordreview/"" target=""_blank""><i>&gt;&gt;</i></a>, from Portishead member Geoff Barrow's knotty excercise in rock-deconstruction, Beak&gt;. On that album, there's a genuine sense of discovery and adventurousness, a feeling of purpose that transcends the notion of a space-filling side project. Compare this with Godrich, <a href=""http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/10/interview-nigel-godrich-and-laura-bettinson-of-ultraista/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talking</a> recently to Consequence of Sound on Ultraísta's modest aims: ""We've got a reason to be here and essentially it's just the entertainment and the fun of being able to do this-- it's a luxury, really. I mean I could be working at a fucking dry cleaners, you know what I mean?"" From this perspective, the question with Ultraísta isn't so much ""Why?"" as it is ""Why not?""</p></div>"|17124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17124-ultraista/|6.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

After all, on the surface, her oeuvre is lined with heart-bent ballads and cautiously redemptive anthems, often played on acoustic guitar and backed by some sterling ensemble. In the late 90s, Orton toured with Lilith Fair, and she's recorded with Ben Harper, Ryan Adams, and Jim O'Rourke, a triumvirate of readymade foils or complements for anyone with a six-string and a story to sing. But that's not a representative sample, especially considering that Orton emerged in the mid-90s as the collaborative muse of producer William Orbit. Soon enough, she was <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO8vSQb9QTU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">supplying earworms</a> for the first two Chemical Brothers albums. Built with songs that alternately seemed winsome or worried, and built on sounds both acoustic and digital, her solo records have historically genuflected to those broad enthusiasms. Orton has, at times, been sassy and romantic, wild and folky, puritanical and experimental-- for better and worse, not at all circumscribed by the singer-songwriter tag.</p>
<p>But <i>Sugaring Season</i>, Orton's sixth full-length album and first since 2006's sporadically interesting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6050-comfort-of-strangers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Comfort of Strangers</i></a>, finds her perhaps more at ease with the tag of singer-songwriter than ever before. There are no unexpected detours or superfluous tangents, just 10 songs of sweet resilience delivered by a voice of seemingly effortless expression. What's more, Orton's assembled a team of selfless session players perfectly suited to the task. Like the titular magpie of the opening track, Orton's collected some of the best musicians at work-- guitarist Marc Ribot, violist Eyvind Kang, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and drummer Brian Blade, to sample-- to help power this relative simplicity. They do exactly that, too, providing ballast and texture but rarely interfering with the sway of the songs. Ribot, for instance, plays electric guitar on two tunes. Rather than take a solo, he sticks to tasteful leads and fills, joining with Rob Burger's piano on both songs to lift skyward. That's sort of like asking Michael Jordan to run point guard or William Faulkner to write a press release; on <i>Sugaring Season</i>, Orton does well by restraining phenomenal technicians.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>Sugaring Season</i> depends upon a constancy that's never before been Orton's hallmark. From end to end, it feels like the work of a singer-songwriter with a definitive stylistic expectation and a supporting cast that can supply it. ""State of Grace"", an ascendant acoustic number about forgetting and forgiveness, feels of a piece with ""Call Me the Breeze"", a gorgeous mix of Bert Jansch ease and <i>Harvest</i>-era Neil Young glow. Tellingly, the latter is a co-write with Chemical Brother Tom Rowlands, but unless you're checking liner notes, you'll never detect the shift. At only two minutes, the string quartet-gilded piano waltz, ""See Through Blue"", is the record's clear musical outlier. But it maintains the same song-forward approach as the bulk of <i>Sugaring Season</i>, with Orton directing the band with her voice and not (as sometimes in the past) the other way around. The album's most conspicuous guest, puckish folk singer Sam Amidon, supplies backing vocals on an ambitious rewrite of William Blake's ""Poison Tree"", and even he stays in line. Here, the <i>enfant terribe</i> tucks his voice behind Orton's, simply making the gorgeous that much more so. Orton is most aggressive on ""Candles"", a tense number about standing up to sadness and willing oneself forward. Despite its brooding strings and heavy drums, it maintains its grace, edges softened enough to let Orton extend an invitation, not a command.  </p>
<p><i>Sugaring Season</i> isn't exactly a mid- or late-career renaissance for Orton, at least in the sense that it will reveal her to a massive new set of listeners in the same way as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16732-the-idler-wheel-is-wiser-than-the-driver-of-the-screw-and-whipping-cords-will-serve-you-more-than-ropes-will-ever-do/"" target=""_blank"">Fiona Apple's <i>The Idler Wheel</i></a> might. Its first single, after all, is a complicated, string-laced surge of a tune, lounging and roaring in miniature waves; it's probably too strident to make good adult-contemporary fare, too mannered and traditionally lavish for more mainstream air. But after six years of silence, it's a confident, cohesive album from a songwriter who sings, in one of the finest moments of her career, ""I have tried to live each day as a last/ I have found life is long, and I've gone and got a past."" It's a brilliant bit of elocution that acknowledges Orton's eclectic history-- her embrace and avoidance of singer-songwriter status and her laundry list of sometimes ill-advised collaborators-- as a process of discovery that continues even now. As Orton nears her third decade of work, that's an exciting abiding principle. </p></div>"|17126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17126-sugaring-season/|7.7|Grayson Currin

Surface pleasures abound, melodies congregate near the front, but if you want to hear what most of us would consider a song, you're going to have to lean into it a bit. In this, they're certainly not alone; between the concrete-sweat synths of chillwave to the scuzzbucket lo-fi revival to all the post-Animal Collective gobbledigook we've seen since <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i>, there's all manner of music nowadays that seems to emphasize the sound of the song as much as or more than the song itself. Could be that I haven't been putting the time in, but I'll admit that the bulk of this stuff passes through my ears without much notice; those fizzy synths can be awfully alluring from a distance, but I can't tell you how many times I've tried to find the song in the center of the swirl and come up short.</p>
<p>2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14780-nocturne-of-exploded-crystal-chandelier/"" target=""_blank""><i>Nocturne of Exploded Crystal Chandelier</i></a> positioned Philly's Sun Airway among the leading lights of the in-between set. On track after track, main man Jon Barthmus dunked his psych-tinged synth-pop in a sea of fluttery, fringe-of-perception synths. On sonics alone, the appeal was immediate, but for all the record's lavish synths and intersecting textures, Barthmus never forgot to slip a song in there somewhere. As Ian Cohen noted in his review, <i>Nocturne</i> seemed to ""[radiate] warmth instead of sounding warped by it."" These weren't just a few production flourishes in search of a song, but dreamily ambitious pop tunes that seemed to form almost spontaneously out of the ether. <i>Nocturne</i> was in-between music in the best sense: At half-attention, it was like a prism lighting the corners of the room, but the closer you got to the thing, the more brilliant its spectrum. Much the same is true of <i>Soft Fall</i>, Sun Airway's sophomore nod. On the first few passes, pretty much all you'll get is texture: darting synths, cotton candy-pink reverb, springy Peter Hook basslines. Spend a little time with <i>Soft Fall</i>, though, and it'll change on you; the squigglevision synths fall back, revealing a smart, sneakily ambitious pop record.</p>
<p>Take<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42740-new-sun-airway-wild-palms/"" target=""_blank""> ""Wild Palms""</a>. Leave nothing but Barthmus' searching vocals and its grandly loping melody and you've got yourself a minor Coldplay hit on your hands. Thankfully not content to leave well enough alone, Barthmus leads us into the track on a incandescent synth-flicker that makes it sound like the song's forging itself out of tiny shards of light. Barthmus is in fine voice throughout <i>Soft Fall</i>, his delivery looser, more daring, but with more than a modicum of restraint; it's a bit like hearing Chris Martin over the PA at Jo-Ann Fabrics, or maybe the best Bono impression Kevin Drew could manage without getting up from his chair. But it's rare that he seems to lead you through these songs with a vocal; instead, all these elements prop each other up, and the song comes together from all angles. The lush, sunbaked ""Laketop Swimmers"" almost sounds like it was produced backwards, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co3qMdkucM0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Drop""</a>-style; it'd be a fine enough tune without it, but it's a whole lot better with it, those inverted synths echoing off its slippery chorus. Barthmus has a remarkable sense of how much to gussy up, screw with, and spin around his own songs without losing their centers. <i>Soft Fall</i>'s falters slightly on instrumental ""Activity 3""; it's the record's least risky moment, the only song that seems to give everything away your first time through. But when he allows a little room for interpretation, even the interstitials can be spellbinding; ""Activity 2"", a sweet, glitchy Gold Panda-esque fritter, seems to bend in a new way every time I hear it.</p>
<p><i>Soft Fall</i>'s a few degrees bolder than its predecessor; there's more pulse to these tracks, more immediacy in these songs, more romantic desperation in his voice. But, two reverb-spackled, hook-hazing records in, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want Barthmus to go even bolder next time out. These are big-stage songs couched in bedroom-spangle production, and while I love <i>Soft Fall</i>'s contradictions, I'd like to hear him push everything a little further. Barthmus is a hell of an arranger, he's really coming into his own as a songwriter, learning when to let a few words say plenty, when to crack his (pretty funny) joke about bad teenage poetry. Of course, all that wouldn't be too terribly hard to miss if you're only tuning into <i>Soft Fall</i>'s alluring top layer, but this intersection of obfuscation and clarity seems to be on Barthmus' mind: ""I try to keep the focus clear/ And sharpen you around the edge,"" he sings on the title track. <i>Soft Fall</i>, like its predecessor, refuses to give everything away at first; if you want to get close, well, you've got some work to do. If you don't, that's cool, too: <i>Soft Fall</i> just works, whether as a dazzling display of sumptuous synthetic ambience, rich, romantic pop, and quite a few points in between.</p></div>"|17113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17113-soft-fall/|7.3|Paul Thompson

For Sanae Yamada and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5482-wooden-shjips/"" target=""_blank"">Wooden Shjips</a> axe-grinder Erik ""Ripley"" Johnson, their compellingly crafted brand of chemically treated krautrocking has felt positively subterranean, taking tried-and-true pop song templates and blasting them to smithereens with looping doses of gleefully woolly droning and guitar noise. Their previous LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15245-mazes/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mazes</i></a>, made sure not to let too much light in, but also made plenty of accessible strides that suggested the pair wasn't only interested in being another black-light band. So it's with their follow-up, <i>Circles</i>, that Moon Duo seem anxious to bolster their sound while still remaining sinister, groovy, and totally far-and-fuzzed-out. <i>Circles</i> is a reference to <a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/5/109.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay of the same name</a>, which, among other things, explores the idea of the titular shape's prominence in nature. With much of the album's conception taking place in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, there is a crisp lightheadedness that pervades much of the music here, thanks in part to its layered, rhythmically indulgent production. It's an uncharacteristically varied, psych-y noise-pop record that just plain sounds and feels great.</p>
<p>If there is a whiff of Gaia's presence anywhere on <i>Circles</i>, it's somewhere in album opener and lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13994-sleepwalker/"" target=""_blank"">""Sleepwalker""</a>, which would otherwise sound like a regular Moon Duo track-- its shimmering, steely buzz still firmly intact-- except that the choruses (""I can see you,"" Yamada and Johnson croon together) feel practically star-bursted. You might think they took the transcendental thing to heart, if it weren't for the following three cuts, which account for what may be the best material of Moon Duo's career. While the repeated refrain of ""I Can See"" may seem exultant, what's presented instead is a foreboding amalgamation of 60s bubblegum pop and dread, like music made by a go-go booted Grim Reaper. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqcBjZmUbSU&amp;noredirect=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""When You Cut""</a>, the best track from 2011's <i>Mazes</i>, alluded to Moon Duo's interest in becoming some sort of deranged dance band, and with this suite of songs, they pull it off in a variety of truly delectable ways. ""Circles"" is the most footloose thing the band has offered yet, surprsingly sunny, with Johnson actually pulling off solos that only your pleated-khaki'd, Chuck Berry-worshipping uncle would dare noodle out. In some parallel universe, Vincent and Mia could have won an even bigger trophy thanks to it. ""I Been Gone"" is oppositely desert-parched but no less urgent, like the soundtrack to a lost motorcycle diary. These songs pack a considerable wallop, which actually isn't much of a feat for Moon Duo. What is surprising is how thrillingly lucid they are.</p>
<p>It's a tough little cluster to follow, for sure, and while the back half of <i>Circles</i> offers its share of surprises (check out the pedal-heavy moonshiner jam ""Free Action""), Yamada and Johnson do feel it necessary to explore the further reaches of their established sound, playing with the same grimy, lock-step formula they're so fond of. But as if part of some winking in-joke, there's the one-two punch of ""Sparks"" and ""Dance Pt. 3"", both of which boast virtually the same chord progression at nearly the exact same speed. It's either a humorous nod to the fact that, yeah, Moon Duo can get a little monotonous, or simply a sativa-induced oversight. It's kind of endearing either way. But despite the fact that ""Sparks"" has an almost mystical, campfire-lit vibe to it and ""Dance Pt. 3"" passes for above average, early Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, both songs block off a crucial chunk of space that could've used a more dynamic pair of songs, and kept the record's exciting sequencing in tact.</p>
<p>As a testament to just how fun <i>Circles</i> really is, though, it's a pretty forgivable hiccup, seeing as the songs are still pretty good. Besides, if it's quality boilerplate Moon Duo you're in for, look no further than the excellent eight-minute closer ""Rolling Out"". Like so much billowing smoke, it sounds like a party at the moontower turned cult ritual sacrifice, with more than enough space for Johnson's acid-damaged guitar to wail all over it. But ""Rolling Out"" is uncharacteristic of <i>Circles</i> on the whole, and part of the reason why it's a record that feels like something of a step up for the band. What seems like such a consistently pleasurable but perhaps stubbornly inflexible formula is consistently subverted in intriguing ways. It's a balance hard struck, being both varied and a little chaotic, yet somehow delicately balanced. Just like Emerson's view of the universe, Moon Duo's is equally ""fluid and volatile.""

But the names of the two albums by Sarin Smoke-- a guitar collaboration between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/919-tom-carter/"">Tom Carter</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/897-charalambides/"">Charalambides</a>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16247-man-with-potential/"">Pete Swanson</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4714-yellow-swans/"">Yellow Swans</a>)-- are actually instructive. 2007's <a href=""http://threelobed.com/tlr/tlr041.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Smokescreen</i></a> was generally spacious and minimal, at times sounding like it was recorded behind a veil. <i>Vent</i>, on the other hand, is bold and upfront sounding. Very little is cloaked or held back, and the lack of restraint feels purposeful. When Carter and Swanson dispense their searing guitar strains, it sounds like they're getting something off their chests.</p>
<p>Not that this is angry or fervent music-- in fact, <i>Vent </i>and <i>Smokescreen </i>are linked by a common sense of thoughtful calm. Carter and Swanson are more interested in absorbing each other's sounds and advancing their conversation than racing to a loud finish line. Even when things get super dense-- which happens at least once in all six tracks-- there's a serenity to the proceedings, a feeling that the pair is as focused on the decaying trails behind its guitar pyrotechnics as the initial sparks that caused them.</p>
<p><i>Vent </i>does start with a bang, in the form of a few fuzzy detonations in opener ""Atmen Ein"". But they are patient explosions, more likely to massage brainwaves than spike adrenaline. Here and throughout the album, Carter and Swanson are like lab technicians studying the effects of guitar abstraction on human physiology. Sounds pulse and scratch like needles scraping out a polygraph pattern; shards of distortion and overload beep and blip like a blurry heart monitor. There's also a sky-staring stoner vibe-- parts of <i>Vent </i>are like psych-rock solos freed from songs and lit up, similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/293-bardo-pond/"">Bardo Pond's</a> farther-out journeys or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young's</a> feedback collage, <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arc</a></i>. As with those precedents, Sarin Smoke's sound has a lie-on-the-floor languidity, but it's never sleepy. If anything, it wants to stone you awake with its busy, forward-moving noise.</p>
<p>Forward motion has been a constant throughout the careers of both of these men (Carter is so future-focused he's already back to performing not long after a serious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46930-tom-carter-of-charalambides-in-intensive-care-donations-sought-for-medical-bills/"">bout with pneumonia</a>; proceeds from the sales of <i>Vent </i>go to his <a href=""http://helptomcarter.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">relief fund</a>). And both of their careers have covered so much ground that it's tough to choose which portions are represented here. If pressed, I'd say Swanson's playing recalls the star-beam guitar so effective on 2011's <i><a href=""http://threelobed.com/tlr/tlr084.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Don't Rock at All</a></i>, while Carter has climbed similar mountains on Charalambides' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1734-joy-shapes/"">Joy Shapes</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Charalambides-Historic-6th-Ward/release/1055784"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Historic 6th Ward</a></i>. But with <i>Vent </i>the pair has gone a good ways to carving out its own shared history, one that will hopefully continue.</p></div>"|17237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17237-vent/|7.1|Marc Masters

I underlined it and wrote in the margins of the book ""John Darnielle."" I cannot think of two words that better sum up the strange powers that the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2845-the-mountain-goats/"">Mountain Goats</a> frontman has spent two decades and a small shelf's worth of LPs tirelessly honing. ""Radical"" because the space he's carved out in the musical landscape (""I hide down in my corner, because I like my corner,"" he seethes on the opening cut of his latest album, <i>Transcendental Youth</i>) stands a sizable and defiant distance from what's cool. His songs hinge upon lines (""Every dream's a good dream, even awful dreams are good dreams if you're doing it right"") that would run the risk of sounding like the inspirational posters that lined the walls of your 9th grade English teacher's classroom if Darnielle delivered them with anything less than the tenacity of a rabid dog playing tug-of-war for the last bone on earth. And ""empathy"" because the degree to which he inhabits his characters is so thorough that it's a little disorienting. We are talking about a guy who has written from the perspective of a 4th-century Danish peasant, a gun-clutching Macon County outlaw, an agoraphobic science fiction novelist, and a moon-dwelling cannibal and has still somehow tricked most people into thinking that he is ""a confessional songwriter.""</p>
<p>Since retiring his boombox and committing to a full-band sound in 2002, Mountain Goats albums have roughly fallen into two categories, what I'll sort-of-inadequately call ""tight concept"" and ""loose concept."" The former are bound by narratives or formal conceits-- That Record About The Painfully Slow Dissolution of A Marriage (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5450-tallahassee/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tallahassee</i></a>), That Secular Record About The Bible (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13483-the-life-of-the-world-to-come/"" target=""_blank""><i>The </i><i>Life of the World to Come</i></a>), That Record About What Happens When Junkies Living In A House Together Stop Being Polite And Start Getting Real (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5455-we-shall-all-be-healed/"" target=""_blank"">We Shall All Be Healed</a>)</i>. The latter category-- records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11181-heretic-pride/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heretic Pride</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15259-all-eternals-deck/"" target=""_blank""><i>All Eternals Deck</i></a>-- is more of a mixed bag: They don't quite have the blunt impact of the tighter concept albums, but the upside is that they give Darnielle's imagination some room, freeing him to whip around from consciousness to troubled consciousness. And <i>Transcendental Youth</i>, the Mountain Goats' latest, is a fine example of that latter category. As they hide out from the cops, root through garbage, peer paranoid through the blinds, and dig their nails into their hands just for something to do, its protagonists are linked not by place or time but by a particular spiritual stance-- crouched and desperate, but waiting patiently for a sliver of light.</p>
<p>For as attuned as Darnielle is to the desperation of the everyman, his music's humanism extends to honoring the pathos of famous people. (A sampling of song titles from <i>All Eternals Deck</i>: ""For Charles Bronson"" and ""Liza Forever Minnelli."") Two of <i>Transcendental Youth</i>'s best songs-- both of which rank among the most searing and immediate things he's written since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5456-the-sunset-tree/"" target=""_blank"">The Sunset Tree</a>--</i> were inspired by troubled musicians who didn't live to see better days. Darnielle wrote ""Amy aka Spent Gladiator 1"" after Amy Winehouse died, but he <a href=""http://entertainment.time.com/2012/09/25/mountain-goats-john-darnielle-on-songwriting-for-tormented-souls/#ixzz27b0plnNT"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> the song is for ""all the other Amy Winehouses in the world who aren't famous, whose deaths go uncelebrated."" With its driving, obstinate tempo and pithily life-affirming proclamations (""Do every stupid thing that makes you feel alive""), ""Amy"" is one of the more anthemic songs the Mountain Goats have put to tape, and it has potential to become a staple in the band's fabled and cathartic live shows. It's perhaps the highest compliment one can bestow upon a Mountain Goats song to say that it has lyrics that would feel really good to scream at the top of your lungs in a room full of hundreds of other people who are also screaming at the top of their lungs; by that measure, ""Amy""'s chorus of ""Just stay aliiiiive"" ranks pretty high.</p>
<p>The terrific ""Harlem Roulette"", on the other hand, whips us back in time to 1968, where Frankie Lymon is in a Harlem studio putting the finishing touches on a song called ""Seabreeze"". Darnielle has a knack for the fine balance between hyper-specificity and universality, and the power of ""Harlem Roulette"" comes from the way it whiplashes between external banalities (""Just a pair of tunes to hammer out/ Everybody's off the clock by 10"") and hulking, private tragedies (a beat later: ""The loneliest people in the whole wide world are the ones you're never going to see again."") It's also a song about the gulf between appearance and reality: Someone who'd seemingly achieved a great deal and tons of adoration at a young age can still be one of the loneliest people in the world (<a href=""http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/star-families-are-just-like-us-2012115/22421"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stars! They're Just Like Us!</a>), and what seemed like an ordinary studio session became, in retrospect, tragic. Lymon went home from the studio, took his first hit of heroin in years, and, at the age of 25, overdosed.</p>
<p>The debate's been raging since 2002: At this point it's safe to say that there will always be people who think the Mountain Goats' urgent, lo-fi sound was better suited to transmit stories that raw. But <i>Transcendental Youth</i> does have one wrinkle that adds some emotion range-- a horn section, arranged expressively by up-and-coming avant-symphonic artist Matthew E. White (an omnivorous music fan who leapt at the chance to induldge his inner Mingus, Darnielle recruited White after seeing him perform live with Sounds of the South, a show featuring Justin Vernon, Phil Cook, and Megafaun and admiring his 60s-inspired compositions). They're a fitting addition because, like Darnielle's lyrics, the emotions they transmit are complex and many-hued. The brass is bright but defiant on the upbeat ""Cry for Judas"", as well as the muted, stunning closer ""Transcendental Youth"". ""Sing, sing for ourselves alone,"" Darnielle commands, and the horns shine like sunsets or sunrises, hellfire or salvation-- you're never quite sure.</p>
<p>Song for song, <i>Transcendental Youth</i> doesn't have the consistency of the Mountain Goats' strongest records, and it lacks both variation and character motivation around the middle. ""White Cedar"", ""Until I Am Whole"", and ""Night Light"" are powerful but strike similar emotional chords and end up feeling like a mid-album lull. There's also a vividness of external detail that feels missing from some of these songs: The narrator of the stirring but vague ""White Cedar"" ""woke up on lockdown,"" but in a classic Mountain Goats song we'd know exactly what he did to get there. Not every character on <i>Transcendental Youth</i> is as memorable as the stars-- the Alpha Couple, the fallen high school running back or the Denton Death Metal dudes-- of the band's sterling back catalog, not every line as immediate or cathartic to yell as fan favorite ""No Children""'s ""I hope you die! I hope we both die!"" But in the moments when he articulates the trivialities and tragedies of his narrators most convincingly, Darnielle finds equal grains of humanity and empathy in people crouched in the darkest corners and blinded by the brightest spotlights. It's not spirituality, escapism, or even optimism, exactly, that he's espousing-- all you know is it's some kind of light.</p></div>"|17112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17112-transcendental-youth/|7.8|Lindsay Zoladz

""MUSE GOES DUBSTEP!!!"" created a minor firestorm, albeit one that was containable because it was utterly predictable. Of course Muse fans would storm the YouTube comment section with bloodthirsty vengeance. However you think Muse fits into the lineage of Queen or Rush musically, they've benefited greatly from establishing themselves as a last bastion of technically boastful and very popular prog-rock that's always implicitly held unkind attitudes toward synthesizer-based music. On the other hand, of course Muse would eventually glom onto EDM. It's the last frontier for a band that's only now integrating those sandworm basslines but whose music has always provided listeners with equivalents of ""the drop""-- a glass-shattering falsetto run, Wagnerian crescendos, solos that are gunning for the one tab per month in <i>Guitar World</i> that's from the last decade. Having seemingly mastered all modes of excess, you'd think <i>The 2nd Law </i>would be Muse's unimpeachable triumph. It's not, and the problem isn't that Muse have gone too far... they haven't gone far enough.</p>
<p>Wait, this is <i>Muse </i>we're talking about, right? Hear me out, because the first half of <i>The 2nd Law </i>does indeed indicate that Muse have absolutely no interest whatsoever in staying within the boundaries of good taste. For about 45 seconds of ""Supremacy"", they actually sound like a real band, immediately after which hushed military snare rolls, chesty timpanis, and anticipatory string wells lead you to believe Matt Bellamy has unwittingly sauntered into a Michael Bay movie or Metallica's symphonic tragicomedy <i>S&amp;M. </i>And titans shall clash as Bellamy speaks with the conviction of a man who is either going to tell us <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr_OpFxCx-A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">they'll never take our freedom</a> or to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb2zIR2rvRQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">release the kraken.</a> With dramatic flair, he intones ""your true emancipation is a fantasy,"" which... OK. But ""the time..."" Go on. ""...it has come,"" that ""it,"" <i>perfect</i>. ""To destrooooyyyyyy..."" Destroy what? Make sure you put your drink down as Bellamy screams ""YOUR SUPREMACYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!"" because all of a sudden having <i>The 2nd Law </i>only<i> </i>in audio form feels pathetically inadequate-- next time you will place it against footage from <i>Starship Troopers</i>, although the closest visual equivalent to this batshit moment is a dinosaur with a cowboy hat manning a F-15 and blowing evil aliens to bits while scoring the game-winning touchdown in the Super Bowl. That's not even the most ludicrous part-- wait until that bit of spy guitar comes in at the end, bearing no melodic resemblance to what just transpired and inferring Muse believes they've made their James Bond theme. <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/muse/66299"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No, really.</a></p>
<p>And that's the jumping off point for <i>The 2nd Law</i>, which wields its unlimited studio resources and chops like a stockpile of nuclear warheads, all implicit intimidation and explicit explosion. You think wimps like Purity Ring and James Blake are taking dubstep to stadium status?  Peep the genius, stuttering hook and vacuuming bass of ""Madness"", which serves as a reminder that Muse's pop instinct has them and not Mars Volta headlining Coachella. ""Panic Station"" reimagines the Red Hot Chili Peppers as multimillionaires back in the ""Fight Like a Brave"" days, bolstering a pelvic bassline with the finest in gated Linn snares and fake orchestra hits. There's obviously a ""Prelude"" here, and because this is Muse, it's actually the fourth song, not the first. And ""Survival"" totally needs it.</p>
<p>""Survival"" is by far the most ridiculous song on <i>The 2nd Law</i>,<i> </i>if not Muse's entire career, meaning it's the most successful. Just imagine <i>Watch the (Game of) Throne(s) </i>or if Queen tried to write ""Ogre Battle"" and ""Bicycle Race"" at the same damn time. As Jess Harvell noted in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13453-the-resistance"">review of <i>The Resistance</i></a>, Muse have an ""us vs. them"" perspective that's always fit well in the gamer lifestyle, and this one's for all the <i>Mario Kart</i> heads using Wario to troll the shit out of Princess Peach-- Bellamy bellows, ""Life's a race! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5YX1NwHPqE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AND I'M GONNA WIN!</a>"" He's soon surrounded by a mock Greek chorus, hamming with operatic haughtiness, ""I'll light the fuse, and I'll never lose."" And you cross your fingers, sincerely hoping, ""please Lord, <i>make him rhyme it with Muse</i>."" He doesn't, and it's the first time Muse draw the line. At its best, <i>The 2nd Law </i>is sort of like spending a week in Dubai, the ostentatious excess is simultaneously offensive and weirdly comforting for its mere existence in this economically depressed state.</p>
<p>So what the hell happens? As you might be able to tell from song titles like ""Save Me"" and ""Follow Me"", Muse's insatiable quest for sonic largesse is anchored by an equally consumptive messianic streak. This in and of itself isn't much of a problem, seeing as how Muse <i>do </i>create superhero music. (Imagine Christopher Nolan roping in Bono to play Batman and you get an idea of where Bellamy is coming from.) Sure, they're capable of saving the world with their own two hands, but only out of a sense of grim, solemn duty that's recognizable only to adults who've aged out of <i>wanting </i>to be a superhero-- Bellamy's too damn sincere about the fate of the planet to go full-leotard, leaving no space for any humor, sex, or any escapism, really.  </p>
<p>""Animals"" and ""Explorers"" are anti-topical enough to leave <i>something </i>to the imagination, but it doesn't give you anything to work with either. They're also where Muse ditch the pyrotechnics for actual piano-tinkling prog and remind you that they're still not <i>that </i>far off from <i>Showbiz</i>, their charming debut of slavish <i>OK Computer </i>worship. You can see the iceage coming on ""Big Freeze"" from two towns over and every time Bellamy pushes for a higher note, you can imagine him being yelled at by a weightlifting spotter. By the time the trailer-leaked ""The 2nd Law: Unsustainable"" pops up toward the end, the panicked transmissions about our energy crises are handled as delicately as <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>' Occupy Wall Street overtones and are every bit as enjoyable. </p>
<p>Truth be told, <i>The 2nd Law </i>superficially succeeds for the same reasons as that movie-- the whiz-bang technical effects and relentless soundtrack is overwhelming, a justification of ""you gotta spend money to make money."" The problem is that it's not any fun at all, and the ""message"" feels like an unnecessary overcompensation for the campy streak that draws people into this kind of comic-book stuff in the first place. Sadly, there's a greater chance of Christian Bale dancing the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jid6FMNHh6E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Batusi""</a> than Bellamy writing a song about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMnjF1O4eH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">big asses for the hell of it</a>. Both seem like a dead end or at least a point where, contrary to the cliché, if it gets any bigger, it <i>will </i>fail. When saving the world feels this much like a chore, you just wish for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFrl01aPPkA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Apocalypse Please""</a>.</p></div>"|17281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17281-the-2nd-law/|5.5|Ian Cohen

Hearing a group's version of an established tune can reveal things about each via comparison, like setting a decoder ring to the proper coordinates between two acts. When I heard that <a href=""http://www.field-music.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Field Music</a> were applying their prim British Invasion melodies and jazz-derived rhythms to a set of interpretations, I dialed in my hopes to the usual suspects: the Kinks, Sparks, something from <i>The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway</i>, perhaps, maybe an early Talking Heads cut, a take on Kraftwerk's ""The Model"", or XTC's ""Making Plans for Nigel"". I didn't imagine Syd Barrett's ""Terrapin"" or Leonard Cohen's covered-to-death ""Suzanne"", nor the Ringo-sung <i>White Album</i> cut ""Don't Pass Me By"". Expectations successfully subverted, the <i>Field Music Play…</i> compilation, which pulls together these and five other covers, manages to be more than worthwhile, while teaching two important lessons about the group's approach. Musically and curatorially, the duo are undeniable music pragmatists with an impossibly dry sense of humor.</p>
<p>The pragmatism extends beyond the compositions and to the reasons for even considering some of the cover choices. The duo is reluctant to call <i>Play</i> an album; the majority of these versions were done for other projects. The well-trod modern standard <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/mojomagazine/sets/the/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Suzanne""</a> and left-field choice <a href=""http://www.mojocovercds.com/cd/291"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Terrapin""</a> were done for special issues of <i>Mojo</i> Magazine. As for the latter, David Brewis told me via email that he was much more in favor of covering Barrett's ""No Good Trying"", but it had already been scooped up by J. Mascis. That would explain the approach they took to ""Terrapin""-- a folksy dirge far outside of their wheelhouse-- shoehorning it into the group’s twangy take on George Harrison-styled classic rock. Their version of Roxy Music's ""If There Is Something""-- originally recorded for a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5583-school-of-language/"">School of Language</a> B-side-- is a more successful translation. They swap out the glam pioneers' bluesy swagger for hospital corners and modernist lines, but manage to retain the original's sense of self-aware oddness, while highlighting the similarities between Brewis' and Bryan Ferry's vocal styles (perhaps a result of their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47739-field-music-announce-covers-album-track-list/"">geographical affinity</a>).</p>
<p>But even when the covers here are a matter of picking from the leftovers, Field Music manage to create original versions invested with their own arid humor. Two cuts, originally issued <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13406-rent-pet-shop-boys-cover/"">as a 7""</a> for 2012's Record Store Day, are drawn from the Pet Shop Boys' classic <i>Actually</i>, complete with with a tongue-in-cheek title (<i>actually, nearly</i>) and re-appropriation of the original album's cover photo. The thematic connections shared by PSB and Field Music are a revelation in their own right, but it certainly helps that the Brewises nail their version of the ever-great ""Rent"". It's not just a matter of the groups' mutual perspective that links love with financial necessity, either: ""I ended up singing it as half gay love story and half love/hate open letter to Field Music itself,"" Brewis told me. ""You pay my rent, but only just.""</p>
<p>The highlight from <i>Play</i> is easily the duo's version of the Beatles' anti-classic ""Don't Pass Me By"", which would seem like an ironic jab at the British pop canon were it not a lemon-into-lemonade scenario in which they took a funny and quite inventive approach to the Fab Four's catalog. Also selected from the already picked-over <a href=""http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2008/07/field_music_cover_dont_pass_me.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">for a <i>Mojo</i> compilation</a>, the Brewises took <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BXGsCNue1k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Residents' approach</a> to the tune, mixing in elements from throughout the Beatles' discography. On the chorus, they lapse into ""Don't Let Me Down"", in a hilariously literal gambit. Listen closely (it's worth it), and you'll also hear bits of ""Blackbird"", ""A Day in the Life"", ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", and ""Yer Blues"". Here lies the lesson of <i>Play</i>, and one of the core truths of Field Music's rewarding discography: There is dark humor and interesting angles-- even joy-- to be found in basic realities and mundane commitments.</p></div>"|17195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17195-play/|6.8|Eric Harvey

And the sounds were, perhaps, but grime has always relied on the same notions of realness and hardness as gangster rap. And like its American analogue, grime began nurturing these traits organically. Roughneck, 1000 mph pirate radio bleats don't require posturing or explanation. As the sound has ingratiated itself amongst the grander scheme of UK pop music, it has fallen back on the same kinds of habits that American rap music has; namely, it has to manufacture ""real"" and ""hard"" where once it just left them amongst the entrails of the conquered.</p>
<p>This manufacturing process often still results in fantastic music, but it also means that the series of ""Dark Crawler Interludes"" that pepper <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/terrordanjah"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Terror Danjah</a>'s sophomore LP-- interludes that feature the vast majority of the album's actual rapping and its most aggressive tempos and arrangements-- aren't just interludes, they're postures, entreaties for Terror Danjah's continued hardness and realness. Of course, the moment a producer begins to actively attempt to convince you of these things is the moment that he might fail to do so as well. And so the eponymous interludes serve as reminders that Terror Danjah makes grime music during a time when it's possible for grime music to come packaged with slow jams, to recline comfortably on tropes.</p>
<p>Danjah's closest parallel in American underground music is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"" target=""_blank"">Prefuse 73</a>, another resolutely underground producer whose work stands up well to vocalists but who more often chooses to stand his tracks on their own stead. Like Prefuse, Danjah's solo work remains relevant even as its potency decreases. It's telling that <i>Dark Crawler</i>'s most interesting, vivid tracks have little to do with grime's traditional palette: the early morning sweetness of ""Baby Oil"", the concrete-block kick and drum'n'bass patter of ""Moschino"". These are the exceptions. Mostly, Danjah leans on a thick, jackhammer middle and yawning low-end. The gaping synthesizer riffs of ""Mirrors Edge"" bulldoze detail, likewise the tired orchestral stabs in ""Dark Gremlinz"".</p>
<p>The music is big but gentle, offered without tension or anger. When it is not big-- see the leaden sentiment of ""You Make Me Feel"" and ""Delicately""-- it is laughably composed and calculating. If you feel the need for sugar-sweet R&amp;B vocals, why not tap into the lingering UK garage revival? It's a missed opportunity. What we're left with on <i>Dark Crawler</i> is craft-- Danjah remains one of the most accomplished grime producers-- but craft without inspiration.</p></div>"|17155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17155-the-dark-crawler/|5.7|Andrew Gaerig

At just two or three artists per track, the duo allowed a good idea to breathe and flourish, leading to some genuine moments of inspiration. <i>FEAT</i>, their first album of original productions, ropes in over 20 collaborators, and it threatens to ignore the very formula which has served the Hood Internet so well. Alas, this Frankenstein does not go on a rogue murder spree, but you almost wish it would-- despite the packed roster, <i>FEAT </i>is almost shockingly hemmed in. Something more messy and all-over-the-place might not have resulted in a better album, but after slogging through the deluge of blandness that is <i>FEAT</i>, it begins to sound at least like a more appealing idea.</p>
<p>There is a war going on within <i>FEAT</i>, but it's probably not one that the Hood Internet wanted. This is an album where guest appearances have seemingly no rhyme or reason, yet, despite that, nothing interesting manages to occur. It's an experience not unlike visiting a supermarket deli on a weekday afternoon-- everyone gets served in a random but orderly fashion and all you want to do is get on with your day. It is a polite, neat album, especially coming from a group that has cut its teeth playing clubs and parties for several years. Every rap verse, for instance, sounds like it could've been recorded in your parents' family room without their minding. Most guests sound bored at worst, and at best like they are just trying to stay out of each other's way.</p>
<p>This is not a mashup album, but sonically it feels fossilized in the same way. It is mostly an indie rap record, but its tones recall the bright, plasticky indie pop still prevalent when the Hood Internet formed a half-decade ago. If Kevin Barnes spent a few hours fiddling around and making rap beats, or if the Blow tried to rekindle their relevancy by capitalizing on the Soundcloud ""trap"" scene, they might end up with tracks that sound like what we hear on <i>FEAT. </i>""Uzi Water Gun"", for instance, is what I imagine a lot of college kids thought the future sounded like after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5618-arular/"" target=""_blank""><i>Arular </i></a>dropped. On ""Won't Fuck Us Over"" there's even a particularly nonsensical and wretched interpolation of the National's ""Mr. November"".</p>
<p>Sounding dated isn't a sin in and of itself, though, and anyway it's the least of the Hood Internet's problems at it pertains to <i>FEAT</i>. The main issue here is a distinct and debilitating lack of craft. Whatever skills the duo have at making mashups did not carry over to their original productions, at least not here. ""Amateurish"" is a phrase that can be used charitably at times, especially if you get the sense that artists are working toward unlocking their own music. But <i>FEAT </i>is amateur in a wholly negative way-- every beat, and thus the album's core, is thin and rudimentary. Tracks like ""Won't Fuck Us Over"" and ""These Things Are Nice"" are built around synth-horns that try and nod at Southern rap but instead sound like what you'd come up with in the first five minutes of ever using Logic.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There are a few moments where things sort of click into place, but they happen to be when the floor is ceded to established professionals like Class Actress (the final 90 seconds of ""Critical Captions"") and A.C. Newman (""One for the Record Books""), a development that is probably not a coincidence. Those happen to be the first two songs, and the rest of the album is a string of dull, droning rapping and unmemorable choruses. Just about the only song that doesn't adhere to a numbing verse-chorus-verse structure is the brittle and ""atmospheric"" palate cleanser ""Exonerated"", which is so torturously dreadful that it makes the argument for never speaking of <i>Kid A </i>ever again.</p>
<p>An album of original productions was a logical next step for a group that's been slowly easing its way out of mashup purgatory for years, but <i>FEAT</i> makes it clear that the Hood Internet were not ready. That isn't quite a death knell in theory, but the larger problem is that there's almost nothing on the album that suggests they ever will be. There may be more Hood Internet albums in the future, and if that's so, I guess the best we can hope for is better networking.</p></div>"|17040.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17040-feat/|3.0|Jordan Sargent

He's an admirer of producers like Dr. Dre, but Ellison's vision mixes the pulse of contemporary urban life with an extra dose of sci-fi futurism. He has his ear to the ground in terms of what's happening now and what's real, but his mind is fixated on what <i>might</i> happen tomorrow-- part <i>Boyz n the Hood</i>, part <i>Blade Runner</i>. And since Ellison's musical palette always circles back to the Eastern-tinged textures that infiltrated jazz when his great aunt Alice Coltrane was helping set the pace (assorted bells, harp plucks, the pings of steel and knock of wood), his music feels cosmic, bound to L.A. as a geographic idea but not necessarily of this earth.</p>
<p>In the last five years, Flying Lotus has become a standard-bearer for 21st-century beat construction by looking forward and backward simultaneously and making music that feels like an exploration. So what happens when such an artist reaches a cul-de-sac? After Flying Lotus' 2010 landmark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14198-cosmogramma/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cosmogramma</i></a>, further density was not an option. That album was packed so tightly with rhythms, instruments, and textures that adding more to the mix would have meant risking identity; just a few more samples could have turned the music into an indistinct mush that contains every color at once. <i>Cosmogramma</i> felt like an end game, and the new Flying Lotus album, <i>Until the Quiet Comes</i>, finds Ellison lighting out in a new direction. He's thinking in terms of air, mood, and simplicity. In an interview with the UK magazine <i>The Wire</i>, Ellison described Quiet as his attempt at ""a children's record, a record for kids to dream to."" While there's nothing cute or naive on the album, you get a sense of what Ellison might mean when it comes to dreaming.  </p>
<p>The album's opening section, including ""Until the Colours Come"", ""Heave(n)"", and ""All In"", functions as a sort of miniature suite of downtempo jazz. This is Flying Lotus at its most vibe-heavy and mystical, where rooms are thick with purple incense and it's always 3 a.m. The sound is not new-- tracks like these were a cornerstone of 1990s trip-hop of the <i>Headz</i> comp/Ninja Tune variety-- but the sheer beauty of Ellison's design sets his music apart. This is a quality he shares with the very different <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"" target=""_blank"">Ricardo Villalobos</a>: By pulling back and giving his meticulously-constructed elements room to breathe, Ellison allows us to hear them as if for the first time. ""Tiny Tortures"" begins with a rhythm that's all bones-- a simulated wood block, snare, and hissy cymbal tracing out an off-kilter beat. Against this backdrop the bass guitar of Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner enters, and the contrast between his gliding, harmonically rich runs and the spare opening is breathtaking. Thundercat's expressive bass work also adds character to the comparatively thick title track, as a gong and handclaps flow continuously like water over rocks while an unstable Dilla-fied keyboard wedges in between the beats. But even here, when there's more going on, the ear can fixate on any one sound and extract feeling from it.</p>
<p>As the album progresses, it changes in feel, but the shifts are organic. If the tracks in the opening section bring to mind an abstraction of spaced-out jazz, elsewhere Ellision conjures the blocky colors of videos games. See the thick 8-bit synths in ""Sultan's Request"", the curlicue melody in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47907-video-flying-lotus-putty-boy-strut/"" target=""_blank"">""Putty Boy Strut""</a>, the simple refrain of the title track, which makes me think of a digital hero on a quest. These lighter moments are careful and reserved. You can feel Ellison putting a smaller frame around each individual part.</p>
<p>The hushed world Ellison has constructed here is hermetic and internally focused, even for him, and the album's guests don't break the spell. The featured players meet Ellison on his turf and adapt to the landscape of the record. Erykah Badu's connection to Flying Lotus' broader aesthetic is readily apparent, as her sense of mystical earthiness is grounded in tradition but free to wander outside of it. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14068-see-thru-to-u-ft-erykah-badu/"" target=""_blank"">""See Thru to U""</a>, she does away with soul singing in its formal sense and allows herself to become an instrument. The result is a satisfying melding of creative personalities but it wouldn't work on an Erykah Badu album-- it's too vaporous, too unconcerned with personality. The same goes for Thom Yorke's contribution on ""Electric Candyman""; Ellison turns him into a ghost, which makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Following the shattering <i>Cosmogramma</i>, <i>Until the Quiet Comes</i> is disarming at first. It sometimes feels like an experiment in how much can be stripped away while still sounding like Flying Lotus, but the reduction offers a new perspective into what Ellison is about. <i>Los Angeles</i> and <i>Cosmogramma</i> brought to mind the L.A. that thrives on acceleration. The energy here is just as strong, but it's concentrated into a smaller space. So while this might be Flying Lotus' most accessible record, it's less about being pleasant and more about deep focus. Each of these 18 tracks tends to introduce one or two emotional or musical elements and meditate on them for a brief time before easing back into silence. <i>Quiet </i>is a series of suggestions or clues and it always feels just out of reach, but that leaves a lot of room for the listener. The surface is a gorgeous invitation to return and see if you can figure out what it all means.</p></div>"|17115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17115-until-the-quiet-comes/|8.5|Mark Richardson

Calling his music theatrical is accurate but only just; if the stage is the metaphor, Wolf's albums call for massive prosceniums, with hundred-strong casts, meticulous set pieces, and props flung in from the wings. The aesthetics may vary, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8773-lycanthropy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lycanthropy</i></a>'s assemble-at-home crafting to<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13067-the-bachelor/"" target=""_blank""><i> The Bachelor</i></a>'s repurposed metalwork to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15492-lupercalia/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lupercalia</i></a>'s lavish polish, but the scope is always titanic. If you're a fan, this is likely why: Wolf spares no sound, vocal gnash, or string flourish if there's emotional or narrative payoff to be had. If you're not, there's probably nothing <i>more </i>Wolf could be doing to change your mind. Maybe that's why the main decision he made on his 10th-anniversary album, <i>Sundark and Riverlight</i>, was to do so much less.</p>
<p><i>Sundark</i> <i>and Riverlight</i> is a double album containing re-recorded versions of Wolf's songs. One disc designated for troubled songs and one for happier ones. In practice, this sorts <i>The Bachelor </i>to the front and <i>Lupercalia</i> to the sunny back porch. It isn't quite a greatest-hits compilation, though it's mostly singles and fan favorites. Nor is it precisely an acoustic album, though that's mostly how these songs differ. It's more like a retcon, or as Wolf calls it, a make-under: stripping the old material of its frippery to reveal how, <a href=""http://www.out.com/entertainment/music/2012/09/24/patrick-wolf-sundark-riverlight-acoustic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wolf has said</a>, it was meant to sound. ""<span class=""s1"">There was a </span><i>conscious</i><span class=""s1""> rebellion on this album against the digital age of </span><i>auto-tune</i><span class=""s1""> and mass produced electronic landfill music,"" Wolf wrote to accompany the album's release<i>, </i>echoing comments he'd made around the release of <i>Lupercalia</i>. </span>It's a curious statement from an artist who's never much relied on or even acknowledged Auto-Tune and one whose music has been thickly electronic (if not exactly mass-produced) since album one. But it's benign. Wolf's hardly the first to anchor this rationale to an unplugged album, nor is he even alone this month. (Tori Amos's <i>Gold Dust</i>, the same idea in the same broad genre, came out within the week.) There's a certain cachet to baroque recordings that New Romantic synthpop doesn't have; it's a play to redefine oneself not as a singer-songwriter but a singer-<i>composer.</i></p>
<p>If only more composing went on. If this is how Wolf's songs truly look, <i>Sundark and Riverlight</i> is like the thumbnail version: everything compressed, details lost. What might sound cavernous with the right acoustics sounds merely pleasant on recording, taking angst-wracked songs and turning them into something more suited to catches of melodies you'd hear passing a storefront. In these thinner arrangements, Wolf's voice-- among his greatest assets-- sounds overegged, and he knows it; his howls and growls are mostly subdued, as if he's trying to keep it down for the very nice PA lady who just told everyone to turn off their cell phones.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This works when the songs were orchestral ballads already (""London""), or when the details lost cluttered what might as well have been orchestral ballads (""Teignmouth"", ""Wind in the Wires""). It works for much of the <i>Lycanthropy</i> material, because if you forget Wolf's statements, it's easy enough to imagine this really is how these songs sounded inside his head as a teenager. And it works when Wolf's composing at his normal scale, like ""Bluebells"", which gets darker when written for cello and piano, or ""The Libertine"", whose startled-orchestra arrangement is the only unquestionable improvement here. </p>
<p>What's less successful is when Wolf takes exuberant songs and tranquilizes them. If you played the <i>Sundark</i> version of ""Oblivion"" for someone uninitiated, then the original, they'd think the first was the demo. A lone guitar picks through the bones of <i>The Bachelor</i>'s original arrangement; you'd expect the violins at least might have stayed, being both rustic and frantic, but no. And Wolf's vocals, though not tentative, come off like laying guide marks for where the full version would insert guttering or conviction or Tilda Swinton. ""Vulture"", another <i>Bachelor</i> track, replaces the gnashing percussion, panting strings, and general masochistic frenzy of the original with sedate piano pleasantries; there's no blood left in its dead meat.<i> Lupercalia</i> fares little better. ""Together"" takes two ideas from the original (the seconds-long classical guitar flourish at the beginning and the curtsying strings at the end) and deflates everything else. ""House"" excises all the rejoicing strings and most of the joy of the original; it's like a midday nap the day after a besotted honeymoon, which is fair enough as an interpretative choice but far less interesting.</p>
<p>Sometimes the changes are just baffling. ""Bermondsey Street"" takes a song that worked because of its simplicity, its word-precise juxtaposition of two affairs, and smothers it with noodling spoken-word interludes; it's the exact opposite of what Wolf said he was trying to do. If the goal of <i>Sundark and Riverlight </i>was to prove Wolf's repertoire has songwriting merit beyond the layers of mythology and biography and reinventions, it's an unqualified success; on its own, every arrangement is entirely thoughtful and praiseworthy. It just wasn't necessary. These songs can make it alone, but they could be-- and have been-- so much better.</p></div>"|17111.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17111-sundark-and-riverlight/|6.8|Katherine St. Asaph

Sometimes it happens by slow erosion, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"">Leonard Cohen</a>'s voice growing less beautiful and more wise, or the brass leaching off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/495-richard-buckner/"">Richard Buckner</a>'s to reveal a deeper layer. Sometimes it happens through trauma, as when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8944-levon-helm/"">Levon Helm</a> lost his voice to throat cancer and then miraculously got it back, intact but scarred, giving his old songs a second life. And sometimes, a vocalist who has been feigning something gathers the courage to be himself: Think of how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"">Ghostface </a>has relaxed into the high, limber whine of his natural register, divulging so much more character than the lower, stiffer tough-guy timbre he used to cultivate. All three of these learning processes bear fruit in <a href=""http://www.mergerecords.com/store/store_detail.php?catalog_id=885"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Don't Be a Stranger</i></a>, American Music Club frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1307-mark-eitzel/"">Mark Eitzel</a>'s best record since 2001's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2703-the-invisible-man/""><i>The Invisible Man</i></a>.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/222-american-music-club/"">American Music Club</a>, the cultiest of on-again off-again alt-rock survivors, have been refining their studious brand of Americana-- which emphasizes old-fashioned strains of jazz, lounge music, popular song, and hard rock-- for 30 years, so Eitzel's voice has had plenty of time to weather. A heart attack in his recent past didn't change his voice the way Helm's cancer changed his, but one suspects that it catalyzed the third, most significant development here. Brushes with death have a way of clarifying people's self-images and drives-- basically, of cutting through the bullshit. On <i>Don't Be a Stranger</i>, Eitzel remains as moony and self-lacerating as ever. He still gets into an oracular mood when hanging around with barflies on Main Street USA. But he dials down the tin-megaphone bluster that, even <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2nNR9WJyXI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">at its best</a>, could feel strained in American Music Club. Now he revels in the delicate inner elements of his voice rather than growling over them, and sounds more natural and inviting than ever.</p>
<p>Eitzel is funny in that peculiarly Eitzel way when <a href=""http://www.ourstage.com/blog/2012/8/15/riffs-rants-rumors-mark-eitzel-wont-be-a-stranger"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">describing how this record came about</a>. He took his ""horrible demos"" to ""poor long-suffering"" Merge Records, who replied, ""Oh Mark. Really?"" Merge relented after a friend of his manager who had won the lottery loaned the money to hire producer Sheldon Gomberg and make a studio recording of the songs. They were first conceived for an abandoned American Music Club album, whose long-term guitarist Vudi joins Eitzel here. The windfall paid for a tasteful, sometimes vivid backdrop that favors rich acoustic instruments. There are intimations of Spanish guitar throughout, most interestingly conceived on ""Break the Champagne"", where tremolos are implied with a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyL5kRefsz0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marxophone</a>. The BooHoo Institutional Choir-- presumably, some people who happened to be around-- adds intriguingly dark-colored harmonies.</p>
<p>Allowing his voice to latch more directly than usual to the mobile cadences of jazz and soul, with the soft honk that was always latent in his croon tenderly magnified, Eitzel channels a number of unsuspected singers across <i>Don't Be a Stranger</i>, like Billie Holliday on ""I Love You but You're Dead"" and Antony Hegarty on ""Costume Characters Face Dangers in the Workplace"". Standout track ""Oh Mercy"" could almost be a Bill Withers song, with a smoky vocal line cracking over a cyclic minor melody, and it lays out a perspective to which the album often returns: that of the ghost at the feast. As ever, Eitzel observes other people having fun while fretting about political iniquities and personal inadequacies. The difference is that his tone, formerly accusatory, has softened and turned inward. It's that of someone presiding at a dark corner table, bemused by his own views, rather than proselytizing on a plywood stage.</p>
<p>The lyrics of <i>Don't Be a Stranger</i> are in the one-sided conversation form that Eitzel likes, with reams of subtly altered clichés abruptly slipping off-register into idiosyncrasy or hostility, as when he sneers out of nowhere on ""Costume Characters"", ""I did not mean to scare your sad little brat."" The delicate ardor and tenuous conviction that typify that album are most sentimentally expressed on the gently swaying piano ballad ""All My Love"" and most honestly on ""We All Have to Find Our Own Way Out"". There are moments of wry irony, as when Eitzel sings, ""The guitar was pure evil like the engines on a jet,"" over gentle nylon strings on the strikingly written roadhouse fable ""I Love You but You're Dead"". But even when the lyrics edge on generic, as they sometimes do, Eitzel's singing draws me in. If Leonard Cohen's voice is a story about the passage of time and Levon Helm's is a story about losing what is most precious to you, Eitzel's is about the circuitous roads we take in search of ourselves. It's moving to hear him seem to arrive.</p></div>"|17116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17116-dont-be-a-stranger/|7.4|Brian Howe

The muscular, calisthenic pair of songs that opens <i>Heavy Mood</i> announce loud and clear that it intends to be a departure. ""We won't be quiet! We're gonna get wild!"" Kianna Alarid roars on the insistent surf-guitar driven ""Love Riot"", which has the odd, rhythmic menace of a dance-fight, while the manic ""Heavy Mood"" sounds like the soundtrack to a packed capoeira class. ""We've got to try-try-try-try-try to lift up the weight!"" Derek Pressnall commands, punctuating ever lyric with a bellowing ""HUH!"" Every line is a manifesto. From the start, this is a record making its life-affirming demands with all the subtlety of a bold-italic-underlined thesis statement: you gotta fight for your right to love, live, and above all else <i>DANCE!</i></p>
<p>But anyone who's listened closely to Tilly and the Wall can see the threads to their earlier work. Fey as they may appear, they've always had a little fight in them. Tilly's strongest albums, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8264-wild-like-children/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wild Like Children</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8987-bottoms-of-barrels/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bottoms of Barrels </i></a>(both released on Conor Oberst's Team Love label), had a forever-young spirit that never shied away from sadness, sex, and the glories of insatiable inebriation. ""Forty ounces is never enough, we wanna pass out in your yard,"" went <i>Children</i>'s teen-delinquency anthem ""Nights of the Living Dead"", before exploding, into a proto-Kill-People-Burn-Shit-Fuck-School group chant: ""I wanna fuck it up! I wanna fuck it up!"" Like a glittery, tap-dancing unicorn, Tilly and the Wall have spent the better part of a decade giving meaning to the phrase ""twee as fuck.""</p>
<p>What should such a band sound like once its members get married and have kids? It's a question others have pondered before, but <i>Heavy Mood</i> stumbles in its attempt to offer innovative solutions. One highlight is the Alarid-led ""Youth"", which spins the track's slow tempo into a philosophy, ""Living for speed and dying young, it's all been done before."" Maybe so, but the best moments of <i>Heavy Mood</i> are also its most aerobic; the dull ballads ""I Believe in You"", ""Echo My Love"", and ""Hey Rainbow"" all bleed into each other, sputtering repetitively in their final minutes rather than building to the cathartic, schmaltz-transcendent climaxes of <i>Barrels</i>' ""Coughing Colors"" and ""The Freest Man"". The only trick the closing track ""Defenders"" has up its sleeve is a children's choir brought on to holler along with the band, ""We're not afraid to live! No we're not afraid to die!"" as the album fades out. Hate to say it's all been done before.</p>
<p>Somewhat ironically, given its professed devotion to creativity and liberation, <i>Heavy Mood</i>'s best songs are the ones that offer fresh takes on familiar sounds. Aside from the opening lightning bolt that is ""Love Riot"", the girl-group-inspired ""All Kinds of Guns"" boasts the record's catchiest hook and punchiest lyrics (""My baby's got all kinds of guns, and he sticks to every one""). As do a few other of the more combative songs on <i>Heavy Mood</i>, ""Guns"" calls to mind tUnE-yArDs' incisive 2011 song ""Riotriot"" and Merrill Garbus's mid-song cry, ""There is a freedom in violence that I don't understand and like I've never felt before!"" ""All Kinds of Guns"" uses a winking play on words to suggest something larger about the fine line between passion and violence, and it’s an engaging articulation of the record's fighting spirit.</p>
<p>But though <i>Heavy Mood</i>'s dedication to freedom, love, and liberation is admirable in the abstract, many recent records have tangled with these concepts with more originality and flair. Last year alone, tUnE-yArDs' exhilarating <i>w h o k i l</i> <i>l</i> explored many of <i>Heavy Mood</i>'s themes with more specificity and bite, and the now-defunct Baltimore band Ponytail made a great record called <i>Do Whatever You Want All the Time</i>, with freewheeling music that actually made good on that credo. Compared to these records-- and earlier Tilly and the Wall releases-- what feels missing from <i>Heavy Mood</i> is specificity: Where are the characters, and what became of those kids passed out on the lawn? The heart of <i>Heavy Mood</i> is lost its in own sloganeering. </p></div>"|17114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17114-heavy-mood/|5.9|Lindsay Zoladz

One strand spun well-crafted melodies with pithy, haiku-like lyrics. The other traced untitled, looping instrumentals, heavier on repetition than verse-chorus structure. As the quartet carefully balanced those complementary halves, a whole emerged-- one in which the parts depended on each other to give the album a compelling flow.</p>
<p>Striking that balance couldn't have been easy, but for their follow-up, Weird Weeds assigned themselves an even more challenging task. On this self-titled album, they attempt a similar weave with just a single thread, sticking solely to unnamed instrumentals. It's a risky choice, as the band's knack for repetition and restraint could grow tedious without vocals, producing music with a blankness to match its lack of titles. But <i>The Weird Weeds </i>is abundantly engaging,<i> </i>revealing a confident, committed band that doesn't need to artificially vary its sound to hold interest. </p>
<p>On first glance, that sound evokes various strains of post-rock: the slow cycles of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"">Slint</a>, the meditative patience of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2402-labradford/"">Labradford</a>, the dusty vistas of latter-day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>. But Weird Weeds' devoutly repetitive approach is distinct. The band-- and drummer <a href=""http://www.nhennies.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nick Hennies</a> in particular-- is well-versed in modern minimalism, and knows how to build tension from the momentum of repetition. Whenever they could go for an effortless crescendo in the vein of groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"">Mogwai</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2816-mono/"">Mono</a>, they hold firm, locking into hypnosis rather than pushing emotional buttons. Not only does this give the music a longer-lasting effect-- it also means that when Weird Weeds do swell, the impact is greater because of the patience it took to get there.</p>
<p>At first, <i>The Weird Weeds </i>is all about patience. Tracks one through four are slow and determined, marching through patterns with transfixing dedication. Just when things seem to have settled into an infinite loop, a lone bass drum lurches forward in the background. That beat persists into track five, bursting into shiny, interlocking guitars (including one played by guest John Dieterich of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1048-deerhoof/"">Deerhoof</a>). This shift swings the album toward the bright and upbeat, as the band finds beauty in the curves of repetition. In doing so, they remind me most of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_Mell"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pell Mell</a>, a band that wasn't mentioned much in the 1990s post-rock boom, but whose subtle hooks deserved more attention.</p>
<p>The album's arc from patience to brightness is as natural as an orbiting planet, but Weird Weeds do that one better at the end,<i> </i>stuffing a miniature solar system into one seven-minute track. True to form, this closing piece builds intensity not through change but momentum, starting with a four-note guitar figure and slowly adding accents and atmosphere. The simple drama recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3247-papa-m/"">Papa M</a>'s more melancholy <a href=""http://youtu.be/fy3fuGV1UAg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">moments</a>-- but don't let all these comparisons distract you. What matters most about <i>The Weird Weeds </i>is how it furthers this band's stature as the kind that others should be compared to.</p></div>"|17236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17236-weird-weeds/|7.5|Marc Masters

Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon have long been vocal cheerleaders for #TeamYoko, whether enlisting their daughter Coco to ""cover"" one of Ono's earliest scream experiments (""Voice Piece for Soprano"") on 1999's <i>SYR 4: Goodbye 20th Century</i>, or penning fan-letters-as-song (""Ono Soul"", from Moore's 1995 solo effort, <i>Psychic Hearts</i>), even though <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa2BXSezPgM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">they don't seem to be big fans of <i>Double Fantasy</i></a>. Ono, for her part, has welcomed interaction with her various alt-rock progeny-- most notably on 2007's indie star-studded remix collection <i>Yes I'm a Witch</i>-- but the fact that an artist who averages a couple of new albums per decade has devoted a full-length collaboration to Kim and Thurston suggests that indie rock's perennial power couple must hold a special place in her heart. After all, what are Sonic Youth if not the modern manifestation of the avant/rock ideal that Yoko and her late husband John Lennon forged with Plastic Ono Band-- a symbolic, spiritual kinship reinforced by the fact that Sonic Youth played their first gig, in the East Village, mere months after Lennon's murder uptown.</p>
<p>But if a collaboration between these three was inevitable, its timing is uncanny: It represents Moore and Gordon's first musical release together since announcing their separation after 27 years of marriage. While it would be overly presumptuous to believe that Moore and Gordon's union here has any bearing on the future of their relationship, it's heartening that they've chosen to spend this moment of their lives with Ono, a woman <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Pang#.22Lost_weekend.22"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">who understands all too well</a> the difficult dance between creativity and matrimony. As such, <i>YOKOKIMTHURSTON</i> is not so much a decibel-bursting showcase for the Queen of Noise and her unruly understudies as a conversation between intimates speaking in tongues and tangles-- a voyeuristic glimpse into a private, discomfiting exchange.</p>
<p>To underscore the clandestine nature of this meeting and instantly ward off casual onlookers, Ono spends the first two minutes of opener ""I Missed You Listening"" demonstrating the entire emotional range of her voice-- from baby-cute cooing to demon-possessed laughter to orgasmic ecstasy to the panic-attack terror of someone whose anesthetic has worn off mid-surgery. It's a move that immediately establishes the album's lawless environment. But, as the song jabbers past the nine-minute mark without introducing any significant changes, you realize the philosophy here is one of understated anarchy.</p>
<p>Composed mainly of Ono's instinctual reactions to Gordon and Moore's spidery guitar scrapes, and of Ono's hushed, spoken-word interactions with Gordon-- <i>YOKOKIMTHURSTON</i> feels both exhaustively sprawling and claustrophobically hermetic. Its six tracks average 10 minutes each, but don't so much chart an evolutionary course as stubbornly linger on a sensation of creeping unease. Even as the album turns considerably noisier and gnarlier in its final two pieces (the tortured mantra ""Let's Get There"" and the 14-minute apocalypse ""Early in the Morning""), there's little in the way of release or resolution; it's the same sense of stasis projected on a louder, uglier scale. That said, the latter track acquires something resembling a dramatic arc if you interpret Gordon's repeated gnashed-teeth grunts of ""my townhouse!""-- and Ono's horrified reactions to them-- as a comment on the price of an Upper West Side brownstone.</p>
<p>These vague conceptual cues are all you have to work with in trying to comprehend the purpose of these pieces. The rare moments of clarity announce themselves with all the subtlety of a title card in a silent film: amid the hysterical shrieks of ""I Missed You, Listening"", Ono pauses to advise us, in rather self-explanatory fashion, ""trust your intuition."" But even some clearly spoken passages take time to reveal their logic: ""Running the Risk"" begins with the trio playing word-association with newspaper headlines as if engaged in some after-dinner party game but, as the contrast between Moore and Gordon's tabloid-worthy one-liners (""GOPs abandon babies,"" ""It's all about the party,"" ""secrets from a stylist"") and Ono's more worldly concerns (""the biggest fish face a little risk… of being cooked"") becomes increasingly apparent, the piece comes to encapsulate how frivolous chatter often drowns out serious discourse in our 140-character universe.</p>
<p>Likewise, the hindsight significance of Moore and Gordon's participation in this project (which was recorded months before their split was made public) overshadows the real rocky-romance story of this album: that of Ono's relationship with her muse, which remains stormy even as she approaches her 80th birthday. It's all laid bare in centerpiece track ""Mirror Mirror"", in which Ono fesses up to her imperfections and insecurities while Gordon gives a disembodied but reassuring voice to the reflection staring back at her, their eerie exchanges playing out over Moore's deceptively serene psych-folk strums. At the track's outset, Ono plainly admits, ""I'm an intrinsically nervous person, I'm nervous every day, every minute... but at the same time, I am an extremely relaxed person. Every day, every minute, I love being daring."" <i>YOKOKIMTHURSTON</i> is nothing if not a noble but exceedingly arduous attempt to translate that perpetual state of splendid agitation into sound.</p></div>"|17096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17096-yokokimthurston/|5.0|Stuart Berman

With the act onstage and you in the house, you can become part of their music, feeling the rumble of the bass as it's played, becoming a tiny part of the very big chorus by singing along with it, standing close-by, like an extra member of the ensemble itself. While it's one thing to <i>experience</i> a good show, the sensation of <i>becoming</i> part of one-- especially when it's music you really care about-- is an entirely overwhelming phenomenon. That feeling never satisfies with just one concert; it's a mainline addiction, demanding repetition.</p>
<p>But <a href=""http://www.blutausnord.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blut Aus Nord</a>, the long-running and ever-challenging French black metal project of Vindsval, has never played live. In 2011, Norwegian magazine <a href=""http://metal-hammer.no"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Metal Hammer</i></a> asked the leader if, despite his previous live reluctance, Blut Aus Nord might ever consider the transition to the stage. ""Our music,"" <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2011/12/interview-blut-aus-nords-vindsval/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he replied tersely</a>, ""is a solitary experience.""</p>
<p>Truth be told, it's also an incredibly complicated experience, using black metal's torrents of drums and sheets of tremolo guitars as a starting point for all kinds of musical excursions and infiltrations-- industrial, gothic, noisy, liturgical, murky rock'n'roll all among them. To reproduce this music live, you'd not only need a choir and a militia of drummers, keyboardists, and guitarists but also the chance to see the same gig several times in succession. That's because Blut Aus Nord's records key on heavy studio layering, where one vocal comes trailed by several ghosts, where the lead guitar line works only as one of many, carefully building an immersive atmosphere of sound. Every listen to a Blut Aus Nord album, no matter how familiar, seems to reveal a new pattern or seam that you've missed only because it's so well integrated. If black metal was once the primordial punk rock of some angry and infamous kids, it is, for Blut Aus Nord, the foundation for a very ornate institution.</p>
<p>That's the abiding lesson of <i>777</i>, the three-album, two-hour trilogy that the band's released through French powerhouse <a href=""http://www.debemur-morti.com/default.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Debemur Morti Productions</a> during the last 18 months. The series opens with <i>777: Sect(s)</i> and ""Epitome I"", an eight-minute track that blasts from the gates like pure, primal black metal. Almost instantly, however, the sound starts to bend, with strangely warped meters leading to interstitial instrumentals that suggest the machinations of hell. ""Epitome V"" pushes blast beat expectations until they break, shards of rhythms and riffs firing off in different directions. Indeed, across the trilogy's 18 tracks, all titled ""Epitome"" and numbered according to their sequencing, Blut Aus Nord mutates the metal expectations with ever more force. The staggering <i>777: The Desanctification</i>, released late last year, includes passages of halcyon instrumental drift and riffs that wind and surge over layered drums and drum machines until they match the peak of post-rock. ""Epitome VII"", eight of the strangest minutes in the entire set, superimposes one set of ghoulish vocals above a math-rock instrumental, creating a palimpsest of strangely clashing colors. For a moment near the end, all of the parts briefly sync, instantly redeeming the song's sense of vertigo. Like the best of Blut Aus Nord, or like everything in this series, ""Epitome VII"" demands and delivers upon repeat listens, proving itself over time to be less a forced oddity than a deliberate twist on <i>how</i> and <i>when</i> we expect music to deliver its payload.</p>
<p>That's a fundamental attribute of ""Epitome XVIII"", the final track of the trilogy's final third, the new <i>777: Cosmosophy</i>. The second longest piece of the series, ""Epitome XVIII"" might appear at first like a lugubrious take on kosmische musik, fitting for a French band with a German name. But above the steady electronic patter, the guitars depend upon that trademark black metal brittleness, serrated tones falling from riffs that suggest an action-adventure soundtrack. Beneath it all, a din that could be a soft-singing choir or repetitive keyboard intones in waves. That sound helps turn an instrumental into an environment, the kind of musical expanse into which you'd like to settle down and explore. More layers steadily identify themselves, too, from the seismic bass to the small guitar army lurking just in the margins.  </p>
<p>Of <i>777</i>'s 18 tracks, the five on <i>Cosmosophy</i> best show the scope of Blut Aus Nord’s influences and intentions. The more prototypical heavy metal elements serve as textural support for songs that take separate aims, making this record less punishing and more accessible than its predecessors. Opener ""Epitome XIV"", for instance, arches through a melody and winds around a riff grand enough for rock radio; think Alcest with the gusto of Godflesh. And with its girder of major-key keyboards and relatively clean vocals, ""Epitome XVII"" recalls the grandeur of similarly audacious French band M83. It slinks into a murky instrumental midsection, though, and reemerges with one of the most gnarled spans of the trilogy. Vindsval's voice has again gone cold, his pop softness swapped for a stentorian bark. </p>
<p>Listen again to that track's first half: You'll spot the threat of the coda in the way the guitars roar just a bit too much, or how the drums trip over themselves as though searching for a chance to go heavy. The same approach holds for ""Epitome XV"", which begins with several crisscrossed voices delivering spoken-word incantations, all submerged beneath a ruptured beat that suggest the recent slow stutters of Salem, Purity Ring, and the like. Beneath that beat, though, another glitchy signal rises and falls, slows and speed; when the song leaps into a more traditional full-band arrangement after three minutes, it actually matches the pattern of those electronics. Across all of <i>777</i>, but especially on <i>Cosmosophy</i>, these moves are so carefully considered and nuanced, it's almost impossible to conceive of a band attempting such transitions on a stage, let alone the subtlety that allows it to cohere. Still, perhaps because of their intricacy, they hit me much in the same way as a concert might-- all-consuming and ever-rewarding, demanding that I return again and again for another experience. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, the book <i>Black Metal: Beyond the Darkness</i> attempted to extend the general boundaries of the form's perception past its usual Scandinavian creation myths. It succeeds in part, with articles about other international loci, essays on the relevance of the stuff in art and fashion, and through interviews with and manifests by genre practitioners with views that don't reflect those stereotypically associated with the sound. Strangely, the book didn't mention Blut Aus Nord, not even in a lengthy ""Selected Discography"" that includes Liturgy, Krallice, and Wold. Let that be little worry: If there's a definitive 2012 statement about the boundlessness of what's customarily considered black metal, it's the now-finished <i>777</i> trilogy, capped at last by the brilliantly inclusive <i>Cosmosophy</i>. Rarely do so many sounds come together so seamlessly and convincingly, and rarely do three long albums released in short order emerge with so few missed. Here, they do, completing a statement that deserves to resonate for a while.</p></div>"|17081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17081-777-cosmosophy/|8.5|Grayson Currin

We just try to play music we like to hear."" Where's my ""And if anyone else likes it, that's a bonus"" klaxon? In <a href=""http://altjband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alt-J</a>'s case, those are some pre-banking crisis-sized bonuses: Their album has gone Top 20 in the UK, and single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPH89HIBLiw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tessellate""</a> has been all over radio on both sides of the Atlantic for months. They're the favorites to win the £10,000 accolade of November's Mercury Music Prize. As Radiohead would tell you, popularity doesn't preclude you from being experimental, but that Alt-J are being hailed as horndogs for innovation speaks volumes about the neutered, post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5321-the-maccabees/"" target=""_blank"">Maccabees</a> peerage they've entered into.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The main claim for innovation on Alt-J's debut,<i> An Awesome Wave</i>, is that there's a lot going on. The notion of a male vocal that's halfway between Macy Gray and a goose gibbering over beats discarded from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13450-eskimo-snow/"" target=""_blank"">Eskimo Snow</a>-</i>era WHY? is certainly a complex notion. Sometimes they sound like Bombay Bicycle Club playing in a submarine. Comprehensible intonation is out of the window, which is probably a good job seeing as very few of the lyrics make any kind of sense. ""In your snatch fits pleasure, broom-shaped pleasure,"" for one. The Cambridge-based, Leeds-formed band thinks nothing of layering on ever more crunchy drumbeats, metallic thuds on the piano, and constellations of sparkle as another knotty rhythm stutters forth: Woody cracks fracture the end of ""Tessellate"", a cloud of synths smother the final moments of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeMiVU77wo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Breezeblocks""</a>, and some incongruous surf guitar twangs over the last seconds of ""Taro"". But these additions rarely forge any sense of dynamic or structural progression; strip all extraneous sparkle and amplification away, and the songs are exposed for the draining, elongated MOR tunes they really are. This was neatly proven earlier this week when Mumford &amp; Sons covered ""Tessellate"" in the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge, the single sounding indistinguishable from their own material.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The most frustrating thing about <i>An Awesome Wave</i> is its tentativeness. Alt-J have also been compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Beasts</a>, and while there's a superficial similarity between both bands' oddly voiced singers, when Wild Beasts hold back-- as they did on the majestic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15436-smother/"" target=""_blank""><i>Smother</i></a>-- it's because they know that priapism would be inappropriate at that particular moment. In Alt-J's case, there was never any vim to quash in the first place. The second of the record's three interludes is a finger-picked acoustic guitar melody, played over field recordings of... a car park? The bleep of a lorry reversing prompts a woman to comment, ""It's good today. It's nice, isn't it?"" That rhetorical pleasantry precedes ""Something Good"" and just as listeners might be about to staple their collars shut for good, the song comes in with a speedy Arab Strap-morose guitar part, and singer Joe Newman uses the language of the bullring (""matador,"" ""estocada"") to describe how he's going to vanquish some unwanted lingering feelings. A flurry of piano rises like a tornado in slow motion, promising a break into some much longed-for catharsis, release-- before paling back to reedy acoustic strumming. They dangle the carrot, only for you to reach out and grab it, triggering a booby-trapped cage to fall and make stasis your sentence.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The members of Alt-J have been working on <i>An Awesome Wave</i> for five years, and it shows. It's both overstuffed and messy, and so overworked that what life there may once have been now exists as a kind of primordial paste. When they rise above that, as with the frequent a cappella male vocal harmonies, the effect is startling-- but comically so, given how incongruous these parts are to the rest of the record. ""If you give [listeners] a list of influences that come from everywhere and every genre, then there's something for everyone and people seem more intrigued by you as a band,"" drummer Thom Green told a student newspaper. By that logic, why not throw in some crooning for the olds, a little innuendo for the Rihanna crowd, a cliff face worth of drops just to round out that universal appeal? Cynical, maybe, as Alt-J have proved perfectly popular on their own terms. But if this is what's getting tagged as an ""innovative"" success these days, then heaven help the weirdos.</p></div>"|17233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17233-an-awesome-wave/|4.8|Laura Snapes

Now the guy's from Orlando, so perhaps he doesn't realize that most people have taken their parties indoors at this point. Shame, too, since this thing is not only the kind of affably stoned baked goods that could take a barbecue's chumminess to the next level, it's pretty much exactly the kind of guest you'd want there, too: He brings nothing but the most chill vinyl; if he doesn't have anything nice to say, he doesn't say it; he doesn't try too hard to impress his will on others; and he leaves before he wears out his welcome. We can agree these are all fantastic qualities in a vacuum, but do they make for great art? That's where the admittedly ample charms of <i>Look a Little Closer</i> are subject to debate. It deals in a lot of tensions for a record that isn't particularly tense itself: How does an artist signify commitment with such a laidback sound? How does one present his own perspective while foregrounding his adaptability? How can one grow to love a record whose main goal seems to be blending in?</p>
<p>To be fair, even Levesque seems to be grappling with those questions on the job. He's described the sound of Levek as ""Mickey Mouse tribal,"" which is an oppositely opportunistic descriptor for such a kind and guileless album, though maybe there's charm in how it's one that reads like it's trying to grab blog hits from 2010. Either way, Levesque's self-appraisal is hilariously off-base-- there is a certain kind of Disneyficaton in how his globetrotting explorations focus on softer and safer sounds. But there's almost nothing ""tribal"" about <i>Look a Little Closer</i> as floor toms, hard polyrhythms, and unhinged yelping are nowhere to be found amongst the high thread-count folk tapestries and wine-spilling light funk.</p>
<p>You can sense <i>Look a Little Closer</i> as a projection of a gentle soul uninterested in the physical or philosophical properties of rock, mostly because its dominant sounds are gentle renderings of soul music. If you've been on a straight indie rock diet, Levek can calmly guide you through international flavors, though he's more interested in replication than fusion: ""Canterbury Bell"" and ""With a Slow Burn"" are freak-free Ren-folk both charmingly ornate and fussy, yet they ultimately feel more like vehicles for Levesque's exquisite fingerpicking than any sort of expression. His high and feathery wisp of a voice keeps up admirably with the winding chord progressions, though the melodies fail to find many memorable turns. In between, ""Terra Treasures"" is a nimble bossa nova that's admirable in showing Levek's range, but ultimately feels pro forma, like a pair of jeans he wore right off the rack.</p>
<p>Levesque certainly has a good ear, but without any sort of personal watermark on it, <i>Look a Little Closer</i> gives as many opportunities to tune out as it does to chill out. ""Muscat Mingle"" goes all in with its South American signifiers-- talking drums, flutes, shakers-- and though its damp analog sound keeps it away from Putomayo sampler territory, it's too stuffed to really groove. The vocoder-laced ""Can't Buy This Love"" and ""Solemn Feeling Forever Healing"" are texturally pleasant, lite-jazz workouts so airy they dissipate on contact. Perhaps more than a perspective, they sound like they could use some sort of grittier contrast-- you imagine one day Levek might find himself on Stones Throw, but for now <i>Look a Little Closer </i>comes off as source material that could be sampled by Madlib. </p>
<p>For all of its retrofitted influences, it's hard to shake just how similar the ingredients are to Bibio's breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13125-ambivalence-avenue/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ambivalence Avenue</i></a>, which cuts both ways. If you understandably jumped ship as he ditched a lot of that LP's low-key charms for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15279-mind-bokeh/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mind Bokeh</i></a>'s more overt commercial ambitions, <i>Look a Little Closer</i> comes highly recommended. But in 2009, Bibio had two things <i>Look a Little Closer</i> is missing, namely context and a true sense of discovery-- <i>Ambivalence Avenue</i> revealed itself as an artist's personality emerging after spending years in mirror mode (albeit one that worshipped Boards of Canada). That was a realization for one artist; this feels more like a beginning. As for the title of <i>Look a Little Closer</i>, Levesque could be on to something if he takes his own advice.</p></div>"|17194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17194-look-a-little-closer/|6.0|Ian Cohen

Based on this limited sample, it seems almost mandatory for modern choreographers to power dancers with blends of acoustic classical instruments and electronic tones by the likes of <a href=""http://www.randomdance.org/the_company/collaborators/ben_frost"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ben Frost</a> or <a href=""http://www.gavinbryars.com/work/theatredance/biped"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gavin Bryars</a>. The third full-length by Icelandic composer Valgeir Sigurðsson, a score for a <a href=""http://architectureofloss.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ballet by Stephen Petronio</a>, is a textbook case of this approach. <i>Architecture of Loss</i> pits gravely emotive chamber music against furtive electronic frequencies. Drawing from the ballet's concepts of loss and forgetting, it's like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXE8gPrkRkQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">something sneaky by Anton Webern</a> and <a href=""http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/catalogue/to72_mika_vainio_black_telepho_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">something subliminal from Touch Music</a> playing in synch: bold, yearning themes often break free, but feelings of occlusion and indeterminacy linger.</p>
<p>Except for his production and engineering work with Björk and many others, Sigurðsson is best-known for founding the influential <a href=""http://bedroomcommunity.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bedroom Community</a> label, a lightning rod at the juncture where the ambition of classical music meets the aesthetics of indie music-- though it's reckless to breezily dispense with the purview of a label that launched the recording careers of people as individually diverse (yet collectively related) as Frost, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"">Nico Muhly</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10015-sam-amidon/"">Sam Amidon</a>. All of the label's different strands gather in Sigurðsson's music, which can be sweepingly neo-romantic and sweetened with folk melodies à la Bartók while remaining alert to the possibilities of microtonality, mechanization, and minimalism.</p>
<p>Muhly plays piano on <i>Architecture of Loss</i>, and his fans will find much to admire in Sigurðsson, whose piano writing treads the line between the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT7_IZPHHb0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Moonlight Sonata""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW3Y4OuTPHQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mad Rush""</a>. His string writing is more astringent, full of naggingly prolonged notes and wrenched transitions. Using a small ensemble, a deliberately limited vocabulary, and electronic processing, Sigurðsson doggedly transforms minimal material, much of it focused on the viola, stepping out of its habitual niche below the violin and above the cello for a star turn. The viola's dominance speaks to the album's equivocal nature; the space it explores between high and low, violence and calm, melody and miasma. Baritone guitar and the occasional trombone ballast the low-end, while pianos, electronics, and even an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n5jIqX63ok"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aquaphone</a>-- the coolest instrument ever, played by crack auxiliary man <a href=""http://www.inkboat.com/inkbio/bioshahzad.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shahzad Ismaily</a>-- fill out the upper register.</p>
<p>In such a bright spotlight, it's a good thing that violist <a href=""http://www.nadiasirota.com/bio/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nadia Sirota</a> plays with such force and character. Very occasionally, the stridency of her tone overwhelms finer moods with a general buzzing anxiety. But mostly, Sigurðsson's cagey writing and Sirota's impetuous phrasing blend into music that appears to make sudden, inspired decisions of its own accord. Her playing is riveting on ""World Without Ground"", where long tones pulsing in different instruments surge over a thumping pizzicato groove. Sirota unleashes ghostly sheens and ivy-like lines that orbit the backbeat in widening arcs, adding a potent centrifugal force to the song rather than another linear one. And one of the best moments comes on ""Between Monuments"" when it unexpectedly bursts into a world-shaking homestretch with stomach-dropping portamentos in the viola. The recurrence of long, stuck notes feels thin by the time of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14056-big-reveal/"" target=""_blank"">""Big Reveal""</a>, but a rugged electronic scaffold and corkscrewing motivic material soon liven it up.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Sigurðsson was named one of NPR's <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2011/04/23/135473622/the-mix-100-composers-under-40"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Top 100 Composers Under 40""</a>, and yet it still feels like we are only seeing the beginnings of what he can do. As a producer and engineer, he has spent a lot of time working in the background, using his technical expertise to help other people realize their visions. He even tends to play a contingent role in his own music. Of his three albums, two-- <i>Architecture of Loss</i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13976-draumalandid/"">Draumalandid</a></i>-- are scores. Only his first and most ambient-influenced record, <i>Ekvílibríum</i>, contains unfettered original music, and even that one was partly worked around the voices of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgKl11lZqm0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">people such as Bonny ""Prince"" Billy</a>. All these scores and collaborations are great, but with Sigurðsson's compositional talent proven, they can't help but feel a little like bided time. What I'm eager to hear is something with a title that isn't shared with a ballet or a film-- something more along the lines of <i>Valgeir Sigurðsson, Op. 1</i>.</p></div>"|17107.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17107-architecture-of-loss/|7.0|Brian Howe

As an artist, he's helplessly drawn toward perversity, and despite his immense gifts-- a curious, darting mind, a silver tongue, a rich imagination-- his career has at times resembled a performance-art dare to see how far one can coast on unearned goodwill. By the time his fans had rallied to petition Atlantic Records to release what turned out to be 2011's transparently awful pop-rap debacle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15208-lasers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lasers</i></a>, Lupe was looking less like a savior than a charlatan. </p>
<p>So give Lupe credit when it's due: This time around, he's trying to give it to us straight. His new album is called <i>Food &amp; Liquor II</i>, overtly promising a return to his first and still best-loved <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9437-food-liquor/"" target=""_blank"">album</a>, and most of its production comes courtesy of his old standbys (Soundtrakk, 1500 or Nothin'). Save for the usual nu-metal hard-rock vocalizing on many of the choruses, it is his most relaxed, rewarding effort in a while, and at its best, it feels like a re-introduction to a promising artist who spent some time in the wilderness. At its worst, it's plagued by the same empty cleverness and strident moralizing that has always dragged down Lupe's music. The full title says it all: Lupe couldn't just leave it <i>Food &amp; Liquor II</i>; he had to subtitle it <i>The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1</i>, rendering the album title so cumbersome and silly that only Lupe could have thought of it. It's like he can't help himself. </p>
<p>Lupe's dexterity remains his greatest asset, and he's at his best on songs like ""Put Em Up"", where his mind lights on unusual ideas and piles up surprising images: 80s babies get eaten by dingos while cars get flipped ""like the ribs on the Flintstones."" On ""Around My Way"", which <a href=""http://theurbandaily.com/1924929/pete-rock-lupe-fiasco-beef-responds/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">controversially</a> samples the same instantly recognizable sax line as Pete Rock and CL Smooth's ""T.R.O.Y."", he hops from ""emaciated models with cocaine and blood pourin' out they nostrils"" to ""human-body sandbags"" to ""the mixed girl in your math class"" in the space of one verse. It's an exhilarating reminder of his sheer, unbounded ability.</p>
<p>It's when Lupe is pinned down by his subject matter that he starts fumbling. Thumping, strident beats like ""Unforgivable Youth"", ""Audubon Ballroom"", and ""Ital (Roses)"", resemble the most overwrought of <i>Lasers</i>' rafter-clanging productions, and they encourage his worst tendencies. The moral of ""Ital (Roses)"" is a sound one (don't buy what you can't afford), but Lupe can't get the point across with sounding didactic. ""It's called being fiscally responsible,"" goes one especially difficult-to-swallow line. Big Boi, for contrast, hit this same message square on the head years ago on Outkast’s ""Aquemini"", with a single line that drew both blood and a guffaw: ""Let your paper stack, instead of going into overkill/ Pay ya fuckin' beeper bill, bitch."" Which one do you think gets through to more people? </p>
<p>Lupe's impulse to sermonize is inseparable from his music, but sermons that lack empathy or drift into condescension are useless. On ""Bitch Bad"", he mounts a from-all-angles investigation of the word ""bitch"" with a multipart character study that paints vivid images of a young girl whose self-image is skewed by internet rap videos, and a boy whose mother sings ""bad bitch"" song in front of him. But by the third verse, Lupe oversimplifies and figuratively pats the girl on the head, intentionally or no, with the moral: ""He trapped in a reality, she trapped in a confusion."" After all that skilled storytelling, the song winds up just another pitying, paternal ""good girl lost"" number. Conscious rap fans might protest that gangsta rappers' dubious messages never receive this kind of scrutiny, and it's true, there is an unfair double standard. But while Lupe remains admirably unafraid to wade into the hip-hop-and-cultural values discussions that usually lead to everyone screaming at everyone else, his touch is so shallow that it ends up feeling crass: cultural crusading as SEO tactic.</p>
<p>His most affecting moments remain his rare flashes of humility. ""I don't know what really matters anymore,"" he admits early on, in ""Strange Fruition"". On ""Hood Now"", he celebrates hip-hop culture's ability to infiltrate and transform everything it touches, from fashion shows to professional sports, and offers this sly kicker: ""Y'all know me, I don't vote/ But the White House? It's hood now."" His admission <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1694167/lupe-fiasco-roland-martin-voting-twitter-debate.jhtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">touched off a small firestorm</a>, but it's one of few places on the album where Lupe allows himself to seem truly human. </p></div>"|17148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17148-food-liquor-ii-the-great-american-rap-album-pt-1/|6.8|Jayson Greene

It's true in multiple senses of the word-- much of their work is concerned with physical coupling or the pain derived from the lack thereof, and even when shooting for hackles-raising anthems, they're never playing for the cheap seats. Grand as they were, ""The Modern Leper"", ""I Feel Better"", and ""Skip the Youth"" still came off like an animated barfly keeping the regulars enrapt with their latest tale of romantic futility. But when thinking about their superficially pleasing qualities-- Scott Hutchison's handsomely burred vocals, their scrappy acoustic interplay, and unapologetically heartsick emoting-- you start to wonder if there's any reason that couldn't be as popular as softbatch, Stay-Puft stadium filling like Snow Patrol or Mumford &amp; Sons. <i>S</i><i>hould </i>they be as popular? The Glaswegian band is signed to Atlantic now, and the <i>State Hospital </i>EP is a strange experiment in this context, never too far from what you might expect from the band, yet presented in an emotionally and sonically cohesive way that makes the songs here come off as unnecessarily simplified.</p>
<p>It would be easy enough to attribute that to the rich, luxurious production of <i>State Hospital</i>,<i> </i>but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13983-the-winter-of-mixed-drinks/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Winter of Mixed Drinks </i></a>was a pretty glossy album, even if it couldn't completely suffuse the activity of Frightened Rabbit's musicianship. <i>State Hospital </i>continues the trend of redistributing the depth of the rhythm section on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11351-midnight-organ-fight/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Midnight Organ Fight </i></a>to everywhere else and often it detracts from their more immediate talents-- Grant Hutchison's stick-breaking drumwork, the nimble guitar-picking of his brother Scott and Andy Monaghan. This stuff is easy-paced, pure hangover balm, in the mode of ""Poke"" or ""Good Arms vs. Bad Arms"". </p>
<p>While <i>State Hospital </i>lacks for pure visceral pleasure, Hutchison can still convey such a deep, muscular ache in his vocals, indicating that Frightened Rabbit still know their strengths. The title track is a rare example of Hutchison writing about a lack of fulfillment from the other side of the sexual divide and problems that go deeper than an inability to get one's rocks off-- in this case, presumably a girl born into poverty with the attendant pall of domestic abuse, emotional detachment, ineffective schooling, and the lack of expectations thereof. Her skin and blood are ""thicker than concrete,"" and as ""State Hospital"" wells up, the indignities do as well-- the death blow occurs as Hutchison reveals her fate ""to keep warm the arms of a plumber/ Bloody and balding/ Who just needs a spine to dig into/ Just for the head and a hand for the holding."" By ""Boxing Night"", Hutchison is back playing the victim as hi-hats and backup vocals jangle nervously, finding the hopelessly lovesick narrator ""at home/ With a drink to ill health/ Just me and these walls and a beaten up chair."" In a previous live version of ""Boxing Night"", he was ""drinking to death.""</p>
<p>It's an auspicious start to <i>State Hospital </i>even if it doesn't display how Hutchison can turn some less admirable human qualities-- bitterness, sarcasm, alcoholism-- into endearing and often funny little songs. The only humor on <i>State Hospital is </i>supplied by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11080-aidan-moffatt/"" target=""_blank"">Aidan Moffatt</a>'s stein/torch-passing guest spot on ""Wedding Gloves"" (""A melting of morals/ A solder of souls/ As sexy as lace/ But with just as much holes""). This is Frightened Rabbit sounding as emotionally meek and needy as their name might suggest, which gets a bit grating towards <i>State Hospital</i>'s<i> </i>back half, where it gets hitched to some worryingly perfunctory songwriting.</p>
<p>Frightened Rabbit have always had a thing for big, soppy metaphors-- the biblical self-loathing of ""The Modern Leper"", baptismal rebirth on ""Swim Until You Can't See Land"". They weren't necessarily clever, but Frightened Rabbit made those their own through sheer commitment. Too much of <i>State Hospital </i>feels like songwriting exercises on loan, asking to borrow a feeling. ""I might never be normal again"" is the climactic admission in ""Home From War"", and it's not enough of a payoff to endure the latest tour of duty in ""Love Is a Battlefield"". Meanwhile, ""Off"" finds Frightened Rabbit stealing from their own supply-- ""Off"" is nearly the exact same song as<i> The Midnight Organ Fight</i>'s ""Old Old Fashioned"", stripped of its spirited folk-rock stomping and charming specificities.</p>
<p>Title aside, <i>The Winter of Mixed Drinks </i>gave us the indication that being perpetually soused and sex-starved was starting to wear on Frightened Rabbit as artists and people-- Hutchison admitted that he couldn't make another ""breakup record"" after <i>The Midnight Organ Fight</i>,<i> </i>one of the finest of recent vintage. But did opening for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"" target=""_blank"">Death Cab For Cutie</a> teach them the lay of the land? Let's not forget that band's Atlantic debut (and best-selling record) was the aching, insular and glassy <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2233-plans/"" target=""_blank"">Plans</a>. </i>Whether <i>Hospital </i>finds them following the same path, at least for now it<i> </i>indicates the triumphs of ""Living in Colour"" were short-lived, or at least strangely ill-fitting for Frightened Rabbit's next, and likely less intimate phase.<i></i></p></div>"|17097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17097-state-hospital-ep/|6.1|Ian Cohen

But it's more potent when left open to interpretation. Delivered in abstract terms, rage can elevate a punk band. Furious questions, not answers, leave a lasting impression. <i>What does this band detest? </i><a href=""http://nusensae.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nü Sensae</a>, the Vancouver trio of bassist and vocalist Andrea Lukic, drummer Daniel Pitout, and newly added guitarist Brody McKnight, explore the latter territory on their heaviest and finest noise punk record yet, <i>Sundowning</i>.</p>
<p>Nü Sensae's approach feels like a cut-and-paste message-in-a-bottle from the early 1990s: the hysteric vocal ferocity of Babes in Toyland's Kat Bjelland; the unpredictable artistry of early Sonic Youth; the violent corners of post-hardcore noise à la Unsane. This band has learned a thing or two about sludge and volume from the year punk broke; in 2010, inspired by Bikini Kill zines, they began monthly fan-mailings to hundreds of followers around the globe. But Nü Sensae also have the finesse to break the mold: guitars that hint at mystic psychedelia, dirging death marches, wildly tense drum builds. Some verses border on floating, spoken word, as in the record's dread-laced final moment: ""I'm in my own world. Life is a nice girl,"" Lukic deadpans on the massive ""Eat Your Mind"". ""Sweet and secret subtle mess. My 45 is loaded. My head is exploding."" </p>
<p>Everything on <i>Sundowning</i> is heavier and more pronounced than the band's 2010 full-length <i>TV, Death, and the Devil. </i>The menacing lead single, ""Swim"", is a dynamic punk song about doing something new-- ""I hit it for the first time/ You wouldn't even try""-- that packs more variation into three minutes than some punk groups manage on an entire record. It opens with sharp, ringing chords and pummeling drums that foreshadow Lukic's clenched, harrowing attack: shrill, full-throated roars that are improbably visceral. Here, and throughout, Lukic flips between coarse, grating shrieks and a hovering, emotionless style that channels Kim Gordon. It sounds both schizophrenic and seamless, anchoring the band's studied loud-quiet shifts. <i>Sundowning</i>'s contrasted vocals create a friction that increases the album's velocity, even when thematically deluded, like on the maniacal ""Dust"": ""Speak backwards/ Talk faster/ The walls become a monster/ You've realized/ Your nightmares/ Are thoughts and nothing matters.""</p>
<p>Melody is not a priority. The band seems more concerned with dismantling drum kits. Pitout's percussive assaults function like an additional voice of their own-- opening songs unexpectedly with crescendoing rolls, or working with negative space to create something tense and uneasy. The distant ""Tea Swamp Park"" and ""Say What You Are"" use skittish, barely-there instrumentation with peculiar, far-off harmonies. The album's introductory instrumental ""First Born"" conjures a slow, haunted sense of isolation, like peaking through the door to a musty old house, suspecting it's empty but imagining the potential horrors inside. ""Tyjna"", meanwhile, is a grim, anxious, and ultimately thrilling track sung in Lukic's native Serbian, centered on a jailed person hit with a supernatural fear of our internalized secrets. ""What do I do now without my thoughts?"" Lukic shouts. Its sentiment feels timely, with a delivery easily comparable to Pussy Riot.</p>
<p>In a 2011 radio interview, a broadcaster asked Pitout about a t-shirt he wore in a picture online: ""GIRLS INVENTED PUNK ROCK, NOT ENGLAND,"" the popular Kim Gordon shirt. The reporter inquired as to what Pitout thought women and non-straight men bring to punk. ""Personally, I'm a gay male, and I really relate to female punk musicians,"" he said. ""There's something inherently angry and punk about growing up a girl, or gay, or feeling like you don't fit into the top seat in society."" Nü Sensae, despite their loud and endearingly torturous qualities, don't communicate so transparently on record. But <i>Sundowning</i> is an empowering listen, and Lukic's roars force you to reckon with what's raw inside yourself.</p>
<p>Last weekend, I went running with this album. I happened upon a young man clad in a very different sort of shirt: ""Cool story babe. Now make me a sandwich."" Dumbfounded, I paused, and started towards him; took a photo, told him squarely to fuck himself, and moved away. Which is to say, bands like Nü Sensae can offer valid lessons for living; stay mad, make something of it. And they also offer reminders that so long as pricks like that guy exist, and better dressed versions of him are entrusted as lawmakers, our world will always have room for vital, liberative punk.</p></div>"|17193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17193-sundowning/|8.0|Jenn Pelly

But I imagine <a href=""http://seracahoone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sera Cahoone</a> is more of a September person. Something about this month, like her songs, is so beautiful and so sad and so right. It's a tricky balance, this feeling. On Cahoone's first two records, quietly released by Sub Pop in 2007 and 2008, she almost got there; the songs were woozy and weary, reckless and heartsick. (Earlier, she'd played drums with Seattle band Carissa's Wierd, which spun off Band of Horses; she played on BoH's 2006 debut, too.) But her new record, <i>Deer Creek Canyon</i>, finds her turning a corner. </p>
<p>Cahoone keeps close to a standard core of acoustic guitar, drums, and some very faint bass; a banjo makes its way into most of the tracks, and strings sidle up sometimes too, joined often by a wiry pedal steel. Her voice is familiar in flashes-- shards of Gillian Welch and Jenny Lewis and Sarah McLachlan occasionally catch the light, then flicker away-- but mostly it sits in a set-jawed, dusky register. It's stronger on this album, richer, more sure of itself through practice or sheer will. She even vocalizes carefully, saving her ""ooohs"" to accentuate particular lines (""I'm feeling naked,"" ""Feel like I waited all night for you"") like little shivers of pain or joy. </p>
<p>These are songs that touch on the difficulty in finding certainty and resolution. ""Naked"" is a dispatch from some emotional no-man's land (""Until it's right for now/ I don't want you around"") and the title track, a hometown ode ticking along like a slow-moving mountain train, could be about either familial or romantic love. Cahoone has a way of lasering in, of making one image or feeling the focus of a song, while allowing herself room to dress the scene. ""Here in your house, it's been a while/ All the trees and weeds are overgrown,"" begins ""Rumpshaker"", and the reunion's only downhill from there (""For years I bent the way your wind would blow/ Then you turn around and say I didn't give enough""). ""Shakin' Hands"" is more hopeful, though it may well be a flashback to how the previous affair began: ""My friends are all here having a good time, but I just want to get lost in you/ For days.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Even when she's consumed with longing, her demands are direct: arms around waists, hands running down spines. <i>Deer Creek Canyon</i> is a deft fine-tuning of her meandering rustic tendencies, the tweaks so minor and carefully placed they're at first nearly imperceptible. But there's a stronger focus to the collection, a sense of tones and textures chosen carefully and wisely. But for all the forthrightness, there's something a bit askew about Cahoone's delivery, as if it's not directed to a specific listener or any particular ""you"" but instead something overheard-- from another room, perhaps, or through a screen door open on some late-September afternoon.</p></div>"|17108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17108-deer-creek-canyon/|7.8|Rachael Maddux

After all, for the bulk of the last decade, the French trio of black metal veterans has attempted an unwieldy mission-- to set the dark sounds of their past to the typically kaleidoscopic expanses of krautrock. That task actually seems feasible for a band with enough gumption to lift its name from <a href=""http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/indon/toraj.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an ancient, ritualistic religion</a> practiced by a third of the people in a mountainous region of Indonesia, or an act that insists its music is a way to leave he world behind. ""The requested conditions to play our music,"" drummer Antoine Hadjioannou said <a href=""http://www.cookingwithsatan.com/interviews/interview-aluk-todolo/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a 2007 interview</a>, ""is to get in a trance and forget everything... when the musician finally disappears behind the forces he does summon."" </p>
<p>But the nerviest thing Aluk Todolo have done to date is to record and release their latest album, an 85-minute, double-disc set of eight continuous and intricate sprawls named <i>Occult Rock</i>. The title itself is an albatross, a double-barrel promise that becomes a burden in much the same way as <a href=""http://www.modern-love.co.uk/releases/symbiosis"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Demdike Stare's claim to ""occult beats.""</a> Perhaps nearly 90 minutes is sufficient for a ritual, but it's also a very long time to ""rock"" without pause; at least Mahavishnu McLaughlin knew enough to call his band an orchestra. </p>
<p>The trio, though, largely delivers. They emerge undaunted, opening with 10 tantric minutes of black metal sustain, an infinite breakneck beat providing a platform for sheets of noise and the perpetual rise and fall of one wintry riff. The decay leaks into the next track, which builds from a start of bleeding riffs and broken beats into a sudden fleet rumble. Hadjioannou is a master of tension here, somehow wiring his rhythm with the feeling that the band is always on the verge of explosion or implosion. Guitarist Shantidas Riedacker and bassist Matthieu Canaguier do sometimes converge in outbursts of volume, but they mostly slink at the edges of the drums, fortifying the anxiety with unresolved guitar and basslines; it's like tech metal walking a compositional tight rope.</p>
<p>Given the sources of musical inspiration Aluk Todolo tend to cite, from the great spans of Ash Ra Tempel to the claustrophobic melee of Ildjarn, neither post-rock nor post-metal are tags on which they likely have their sights set. During ""IV"", the voice of Brian McMahan talking about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoH5MPIgM7c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shipwrecks </a>always seems just around the corner; ""III"" delivers both the groaning textures and deserved, overpowering climaxes of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cddprg-YwXQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mogwai's ""Like Herod""</a>. With its surges through feedback and barreling rhythm section, ""VI"" splits the difference between those progenitors. Connected as they are, however, these tracks sometimes feel excessive and unedited, like thoughts from open-ended improvisations that were never whittled down to their necessities. When Aluk Todolo repeatedly cycle through riffs and valleys, that audacity starts to become an onus, turning what should be an adventure into a rote marathon. </p>
<p>Such post-rock maneuvers only dominate the middle half of <i>Occult Rock</i>. Aluk Todolo appropriately revert toward their touchstones for the last two tracks. ""VII"" is the album's true <i>kosmische</i> beauty, with starts, stops, and slow builds that suggest Neu! augmented by the guitar spires of Manuel Göttsching at <a href=""http://www.ashra.com/disco/1841e2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">both his most dense and gossamer</a>. For all those references, it's actually a refreshing update on a familiar sound, thanks in large part to the trio's aggressive play. That is, they treat this like heavy metal musicians. The inverse holds for the closer, ""VIII"", a doomy monolith of cascading tones and unison chords. Behind it, Hadjioannou keeps the beat, forcing the pulse up through the vortex of sound. If you're into drone metal, it might inspire a slow, steady head bang. If you're coming to Aluk Todolo from jazz or progressive rock circles, you might call it a head nod. Either way, the unwieldy mission is mostly accomplished.      </p></div>"|17191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17191-occult-rock/|7.7|Grayson Currin

Brian Gibson's bass and Brian Chippendale's drums lash out in such a dizzying flurry that there’s barely time to sort out what’s happening in one track before they’ve moved on to the next. Their music is something like an auditory version of Chippendale's visual art. His comics, like <i>Ninja</i> and<i> Maggots</i>, assault the eye with pages full of scratchy-cute grotesqueries. Adjust to their over-cranked wavelength, and it becomes clear that there's not only narrative structure underneath all that visual noise but new ways of reading to be learned. </p>
<p>Lightning Bolt's music has grown gotten tighter and brawnier over the years, from the murky rawness of their 1999 self-titled debut to the mock metal heroics of 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13577-earthly-delights/"" target=""_blank""><i>Earthly Delights</i></a>, and a big part of why they've become a festival draw. Their balance between traditional heaviness and crazed time signatures gets even regulation rock dudes sloshing warm beer on each other. As awesome as that evolution's been, the alienating and willfully abrasive sides of Lightning Bolt sometimes get the short shrift when people talk about them like they're mainly a jackhammer live unit that also happens to put out records. <i>Oblivion Hunter</i>, an EP of tracks recorded in 2008 that's long enough to pass as an album, is thrilling, irritating, and ecstatic in equal measure, and it offers a better summation of all the band's strengths than their last few releases.</p>
<p>While <i>Oblivion Hunter</i> doesn't contain the one-gut-punch-after-another focus of <i>Earthly Delights </i>or the brain-scrambling sonic abundance of 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4788-hypermagic-mountain/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hypermagic Mountain</i></a>, it also lets the band stretch out, mess around, have fun, and chase solos past the point of common sense. ""Fly Fucker Fly"" might be the closest the band has ever come to writing a pop song, complete with a breath-catching bridge and triumphant outro, though it's still suitably gnarly. If recent LB albums have pushed the intricacy and heaviness of their aesthetic to the limit, here they sound relaxed, goofy, even catchy.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say they're not also going to test the patience of the less noise-inclined, or that Chippendale's drums aren't still astonishing examples of how to keep things raw and virtuosic at the same time. ""Baron Wasteland"" plays like a band jamming out a rock equivalent to Alec Empire circa <i>The Destroyer</i>, with metallic breakbeats whizzing by at high speed while some hellish feedback attempts to eat them up. Still, ""World Wobbly Wide"" is really the only track here that stands to test the patience of Lightning Bolt's most committed fans. It's 13 minutes of blown-out assault, climaxing with a blast that just goes on and on until it starts to sound less like a rock song and more like a smoke alarm fed through a couple of bad distortion pedals..</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the duo indulge a mischievous streak. The sing-song harmonizing between Chippendale's yelps and Brian Gibson's noodling, the all blown-out bass, and the extreme finger-tapping sound like the work of two friends trying to one-up each other. After so many years, albums, and shows, Lightning Bolt have grown into one of the fiercest bands on the planet. But the looseness of <i>Oblivion Hunter</i> is a nice reminder that the core of their appeal isn't so much that they're pushing their sound into new places, but that they're two guys who can't hide how happy they are that they get to spend their lives making this kind of a racket.</p></div>"|17110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17110-oblivion-hunter-ep/|7.2|Jess Harvell

That sound-- Lex Luger and Southside's thunderous productions paired with Waka's halting flow-- is now on the downside of its peak as a whole host of newer rappers and producers have begun to spread their influence. But while Waka's second album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16717-triple-f-life-friends-fans-family/"">Triple F Life</a></i>, came and went with little fanfare over the summer, his new mixtape, <i>Salute Me or Shoot Me 4: Banned From America</i>, proves that his grasp on his own aesthetic is strong enough to keep his music from feeling stale.</p>
<p>Waka's energy has an almost gravitational pull and it's as strong here as ever. But lately, he's begun to expose a softer side of himself (like subtitling his last album <i>Friends, Fans, and Family</i>) that makes him Fozzie Bear-lovable. In fact, his songs are hardly even angry anymore. There's a gleeful streak running through <i>Salute Me 4</i> that gives it a decidedly different vibe: It's an hour of shouting that sounds like a hug.</p>
<p>Waka also remains an underrated songwriter, and the hooks on <i>Salute Me 4</i> come at you in a barrage. Though he's largely fallen off the pop charts, tracks like ""Tweekin"", ""Randy Savage"", and especially ""24 Hours"" are pure pop-rap. And though he's often derided for his simple rhymes, one man's ""simple"" is another man's joy at being able to sing along to hooks by the second chorus, and Southern rap blogs are littered with rappers who can't figure out that balance. Waka has no such problem.</p>
<p><i>Salute Me or Shoot Me 4</i> largely finds Waka in a vacuum: Lex Luger is absent, so Southside ably handles much of the production. Guest spots are limited to Brick Squad members, old friends (Yo Gotti, Roscoe Dash), and newer rappers who play well with Waka's aesthetic. But the record is risky in another way: hip-hop hates nothing more than something that doesn't sound new. Then again, this is a guy who claimed Nas as one of his five favorite rappers while mocking the importance of lyrics. Uncompromising self-confidence has never been a problem for him.</p></div>"|17228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17228-salute-me-or-shoot-me-4-banned-from-america/|6.7|Jordan Sargent

But the past isn't a place that Daniel Lopatin ever seems to easily position in his music when he works under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> guise (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"">his other projects</a> are a different story). He may use it as a reference point, as with his emulation of the vintage <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairlight_CMI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fairlight</a> cut-ups favored by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/138-art-of-noise/"">Art of Noise</a> included on last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16031-replica/"">Replica</a></i>, but OPN's material mostly feels like a slow, untethered drift into a tentative future. <i>Music For</i> <i>Reliquary House</i>, his half of this split LP with fellow celebrator of change and lover of pseudonyms Jeff Witscher, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29260-rene-hell/"">Rene Hell</a>, is taken from an installation/performance piece conducted by Lopatin and video artist <a href=""http://www.nateboyce.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nate Boyce</a>. It's coarse and challenging, a serrated edge severed into a once-placid template. Hell picks up the thread with his side, <i>In 1980 I Was a Blue Square</i>, which begins in conflict and ends in a form of serene resolution. </p>
<p><i>Music For Reliquary House</i> is a logical extension of the path traveled by <i>Replica</i>, and it pushes those ideas to extremes. A noise resembling a circular saw slashing through metal punctures the ""Stone of Spiritual Understanding"", while high-pitched frequencies reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>'s piercing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpmcqKh1rqk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ventolin""</a> make ""Free Ride"" a genuinely distressing listen. ""The Letter"" sounds like Lopatin's hard drive attempting to turn itself inside out, edging close to the collapse-of-civilization vibe of ""Nil Admirari"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14326-returnal/""><i>Returnal</i></a>. This resembles a staging area in which new OPN ideas may be tested out rather than a potential future direction, but that doesn't invalidate the material. The first half of the wonderful ""Midday"" feels like someone just opened up a box full of manic chatter, letting it flood out into the world in a burst of expression before a familiar wave of ambience ties it down to a loose structure.</p>
<p>Structure is something Rene Hell brings once the baton is passed. A looped piano roll opens his side, living up to his <a href=""http://nnatapes.com/available-releases/oneohtrix-point-never-rene-hell-split-lp/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">promise</a> of making something partially influenced by ""mid 20th century classical music."" Bursts of willful antagonism zoom into sporadic focus throughout <i>In 1980 I Was a Blue Square</i>, neatly tying it to what came before. A festering glitch rises up around those piano rolls on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14124-meta-concrete/"" target=""_blank"">""Meta Concrete""</a>; ""The Bridge"" veers close to complete disintegration. But Hell's central role, in the unlikely event that these two artists mapped this out conceptually, is to provide a dose of introspection following the ragged disemboweling provided by OPN. ""Qi"" is a doleful elegy stretched out over six minutes, forming one part oppressive death march, one part tilt up toward the sky. That's indicative of Hell's work here, providing a big mesh of emotional and stylistic contrasts, helping add to the general feel of being pushed and pulled in multiple directions at the same time.</p>
<p>Lopatin <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/oneohtrix-point-never/01-anecdotal-stone-of-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> his material on <i>Music For</i> <i>Reliquary House</i> is ""a series of hallucinatory informatic assaults"" inspired by the modernist sculptures of David Smith, Anthony Caro, Isamu Noguchi, and Tony Smith. It's reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>'s 1995 collaboration with artist Charles Long, <i>Music For the</i> <i>Amorphous Body Study Center</i>. It's a similar musical digression, pulling on fibers of already extant ideas, taking them to a place ill-suited to the traditional album format. So it's appropriate that Lopatin decided to release it this way, re-tooling the tracks following a multimedia performance of his work with Boyce at the MoMA in December last year, then gelling them with the work of another artist similarly active in underground circles. For Lopatin and Hell, it purposefully muddies the intent behind work that already leaves a wildly disorienting imprint, that accrues an unusual type of weight by positioning outright hostility right on top of humor, anger, and tranquility.</p></div>"|17106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17106-music-for-reliquary-house-in-1980-i-was-a-blue-square/|6.6|Nick Neyland

Sunlit, pastoral, and serenely strange, it feels like something unearthed by an enterprising reissue label like <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light in the Attic</a>, rather than a brand-new record on <a href=""http://www.capturedtracks.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a>. It's a gentle listen-- the snare drum doesn't receive a lot of attention, and is tapped rather than struck when it does. The pace never ventures beyond mid tempo. But as a whole, it glows with easy comfort, and its wistfulness deepens with repeated listens.</p>
<p>Like his former bandleader <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Ariel+Pink"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a>, Cohen bends the reality of his pop-culture references so that his music both begs for and resists carbon-dating. <i>Overgrown Path</i> is pleasingly blurry on just where and when it's supposed to feel beamed from: Does it feel like a singer-songwriter record from the 1970s? Some lost psychedelic-era curiosity? <i>Village Green</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2304-the-kinks/"" target=""_blank"">Kinks</a>? A forgotten 1980s jangle-rock band? At various points, I felt certain of each. But unlike Pink, Cohen isn't out to discomfort or unsettle you: He mostly just wants to build a soothing space away from the world for a while, a place where head can breathe and his loneliness can find some room to expand. The time-warp in his music is just a way to cover his tracks.</p>
<p>In fact, <i>Overgrown Path</i> is made of only comforting sounds: cracked, spidery guitars, grand pianos, reverb haze, and Cohen's little Ray Davies croon. Cohen's voice is frail, but uncommonly beautiful, and capable of reaching into a weightless falsetto. The album's title, which suggests cozy remoteness, a time-neglected spot worth rediscovering, strongly reinforces this vibe: This is music to get lost to. Listening to its nine songs on repeat, I was strongly hit with the urge to pad around my home in socks, maybe brew some tea.</p>
<p>Cohen recorded nearly all the instruments parts alone in rural Vermont, and, as a musician, he has extraordinary rapport with himself. The loose Ringo-like tumble of the drum fills on ""Caller No.99"", its stair-step bassline, the drowsy tangle of wah-wah'ed and clean-toned guitars-- the elements fall into place so easily that it just feels like the dynamic of an expert, veteran band. The fact that it's all Cohen speaks volumes. ""Monad"" opens in arresting harmonic limbo, a soup of pedal-steeped piano and an uneasily questioning bassline, before easing into smoother, jazzy AM-pop territory. The transition feels like an exhalation.</p>
<p>As frontman to his one-man band, Cohen has a gentle, lost soul's sad-eyed presence: ""Peace in life I try to find/ It eludes me another time,"" he sings on ""Open Theme"", in a croon so tender it could soothe a colicky newborn. The chorus is a lament about directionlessness that feels dredged from an old folk ballad: ""I have pushed a broken wheel."" Similarly, ""Don't Look Today"" pines for ""some place you couldn't get to."" Cohen crossed the country, from L.A. to Vermont, to record this music of dislocation, and <i>Overgrown Path</i> is darkened with small shadows that suggest a hard-won peace of mind. On ""Solitude"", he sings: ""Sunrise, sunset/ Where I am at this moment/ Is the same as yesterday/ I travel out and the life is so different/ No shadows in the way."" Cohen might have made the album for himself as a keepsake, an antidote to the rest of life's pressing noise. It works that way for us, as well.</p></div>"|17165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17165-overgrown-path/|7.6|Jayson Greene

Across a dozen or so singles, they could be abstract or deep, jazzy or jackhammering, acidic or flashback-struck (audition the hallucinatory breakdown of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjHAE1lvD4A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Deep Blue Meanies""</a> off their second effort), tweaking dance music's tropes just enough.</p>
<p>But their musical ambitions began to crown last year when they released a single on Brooklyn's idiosyncratic dance imprint, Golf Channel. ""Unleash the Golem Pt. 1"" was a brooding and glowering 16 minutes, darker than anything else the duo had attempted, drawing on and questioning their heritage in the process. ""Is Israel a modern golem created to protect the Jews but left to run amok? Is it an experiment bound for destruction?"" went the 12""'s insert, the first installation in a planned four-part series of singles that will culminate with an experimental DVD. They then followed it up with a lascivious Italo track, ""Jewsex"" (<a href=""http://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000027008875-v8etbj-crop.jpg?b96a101%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">complete with suggestive hamantaschen</a>), to further confound expetations. As if that weren't enough, the duo now unleashes <i>Techno Primitivism</i>, an 85-minute album odyssey spread across three slabs of vinyl that finds them delving into almost everything <i>but</i> the dance music trope of the title.</p>
<p>No longer constrained to one side of a 12"" dance single, Juju &amp; Jordash sprawl out on <i>Techno Primitivism</i> with one of dance music's most astounding, adventurous and confounding sides of the year. ""Stoplight Loosejaw/Diatoms/Backwash"" is a 15-minute suite that begins with Czamanski hammering out low-octave piano chords with the sustain pedal down, the tones left to waft and commingle with a migraine throb, and effervescent gurgles as aleatoric as something <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"" target=""_blank"">Ricardo Villalobos</a> might deploy. But whereas Villalobos presents a disorienting sense of stasis in his productions (or as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17156-dependent-and-happy/"" target=""_blank"">recent review</a> put it: ""like watching traffic""), the mood here shifts minute by minute, the compound volatile rather than stable. After the nuclear submarine-deep bass goes code red, the piano re-enters-- this time as percussive and plinking as one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"" target=""_blank"">John Cage</a>'s prepared pianos-- a brief glimpse of sunlight behind black thunderclouds. Nearing eight minutes, the synths distort and then turn blissful for a few moments and then menacing once again. And then there arise live drums and an unexpected bluesy guitar lick at the coda-- courtesy of Aner-- that will further confound expectations.</p>
<p>A primitive drum machine pulse and more of Aner's guitar make for a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"" target=""_blank"">Cluster</a>-like respite on the brief ""Rogue Wave"" before one of the album's strangely satisfying experiments, ""Shakshuka Dub"", suggests a strange world between John Zorn's Bar Kokhba compositions, Augustus Pablo's melodica-laced dubs and Mr. Fingers. Elsewhere, Juju &amp; Jordash build ""Track David Would Play"" out of anxious ticks and sub-aquatic chords, revisiting the early-90s acid house of ""Powwow"" but inverting its components, the triggered snare and hi-hat hits not serving as meter, but embellishment. ""Shrublands"" scales from ominous to transcendent, courtesy of Czamanski's organ sliding between evoking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Ra</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30103-steve-moore/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Moore</a>. The title track starts off spacy and off-kilter, slowly cresting with hand-drum patterns and slowed vocal mumbles while follow-up ""Loosey Goosey"" shimmers and crackles, one of the album's few unadulterated dancefloor cuts.</p>
<p>Throughout, there's a sense of the casual and the ad hoc, no doubt the result of the duo simply letting the tape run on studio sessions and paring them down into succinct tracks later on.

It wasn't the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a> cover or Steve Berlin's saxophone skronking through ""Fireplace"". It wasn't Michael Stipe singing what purported to be a love song, which he had sworn at one point never to do. The record packed an even bigger surprise: an actual radio hit. Before the year was over, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7oQEPfe-O8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The One I Love""</a> had peaked at No. 9 on the <i>Billboard</i> singles chart, and this was back when that meant something. It was R.E.M.'s first foray into a mainstream crowded with hair metal bands, mall-pop acts, and AOR interchangeables. Few of these acts would survive the decade, but this unlikely smash signaled only the start of the group's prolonged ascent.</p>
<p>How did this Southern rock band, who had more in common with Wire than with then-popular Peach Staters Georgia Satellites, find a spot in the public consciousness alongside U2, Guns N' Roses, and George Michael, who all more or less owned 1987? R.E.M. cultivated an air of mystery that extended from their music (the obscure lyrics, the refusal to lip sync in videos) to the packaging (mismatched tracklists, head-scratching instructions to ""File Under Fire""). And ""The One I Love"" was an odd choice for a hit: Peter Buck's guitar possesses a rich, strange grain that charges the song with vague menace, especially when he unspools that psych-rock solo, and the mosaic hook itself is split between Stipe shouting ""Fire!"" in an empty theater and Mike Mills adding a descending countermelody. Lyrically, the song is one contradiction twisting into another: ""This one goes out to the one I love/ A simple prop to occupy my time."" Twenty-five years later, it remains nearly impossible to parse the implications of that particular couplet; on the other hand, 25 years later, it's still worth trying, as the latest in Capitol Records' reissue series proves.</p>
<p>If 1985's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14446-fables-of-the-reconstruction-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i></a> was their most self-consciously Southern record to date and 1986's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15625-lifes-rich-pageant-25th-anniversary-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i></a> their most overtly political, <i>Document</i> maintained both their regional self-definition as well as their indirect social engagement, even going so far as to sample Joseph Welch reprimanding Joseph McCarthy. (""At long last, have you left no sense of decency?"") The album is a prolonged meditation on the idea of labor, opening with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=559eWB93jW4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Finest Worksong""</a> before teasing out the implications on ""Welcome to the Occupation"". The defiantly chipper ""Exhuming McCarthy"" opens with the clack of Stipe's typewriter, connecting the work of the band with that of the journalist, and even ""Fireplace"" is less about the dance party than the preparations for it: ""Hang up your chairs to better sweep, clear the floor to dance,"" Stipe sings, twisting his lines with each repetition until the entire building has been dismantled in an act of constructive destruction.</p>
<p>And yet, R.E.M. never sound openly angry or at all condescending here. They may not have had day jobs by then, but they saw their art as labor and their labor as art. Engaging with politics and social issues in their music emboldened and arguably ennobled them, although this lyrical mission didn't alter their general approach to their work. The band's democracy was not only a professional strategy but a musical one as well: R.E.M. always worked best when the four members had equal representation in the songs, and producer Scott Litt helps them find the right balance. Bill Berry is still the backbone, a one-man rhythm section that allows Mills to play ingeniously melodic basslines. Stipe continues his trajectory toward extroversion, bending his voice into a reedy sneer on ""Lightnin' Hopkins"" and rattling off a weird history of the 20th century on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0GFRcFm-aY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)""</a>. That may be his best vocal performance, spirited and goofy and ecstatic. The album's most direct line-- ""I'm addressing the realpolitik,"" from ""Exhuming McCarthy""-- may also be his funniest; this was, after all, the man who made a virtue out of mumbly obscurity.</p>
<p>But <i>Document</i> is Buck's album, from the chiming fanfare that opens ""Finest Worksong"" to the sludgy trudge that closes ""Oddfellows Local 151"". He sounds intent on summing up more than three decades of rock guitar in these 40 minutes. Jangle was only the base from which to venture into surf, post-punk, country rock, even a little rockabilly. This is R.E.M. at their most rock: more targeted than <i>Green</i> but less self-conscious than <i>Monster.</i> Still, despite the thematic throughline, Buck's heroics, and a predictably excellent remastering job on the reissue, <i>Document</i> still sounds like the band's least satisfying I.R.S. album (says the <i>Fables</i> apologist), with an especially ragtag second side that starts almost perfectly but drifts off as it proceeds. As covers go, Wire's ""Strange"" proves less revelatory than the Clique's ""Superman"" on <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, and the moody ""King of Birds"" and ""Oddfellows Local 151"" leave the album tattered at the ends.</p>
<p>However, saying <i>Document </i>is their weakest indie-label release is like saying Mothra was the least of Godzilla's foes: That big bug could still level Tokyo. Even five albums into their career, R.E.M. managed to sound both confident and unsettled, always pushing into new territory but galvanized by what they could do together. Whether they knew it at the time, <i>Document</i> represents a band readying itself for the spotlight as though preparing for a fight. That much is apparent on the bonus disc, which-- like the reissues for <i>Murmur </i>and <i>Reckoning-- </i>documents the band's live show and emphasizes the life of the song rather than the creation. The band wrangled them into new shapes every night, whether by adding new space and momentum to ""Oddfellows"" or appending ""Exhuming McCarthy"" with Mills' new vocal line: ""Meet me at the book burning!"" Recorded during a European tour, the live disc ends not with a <i>Document </i>number, but with a lovely, hymnlike performance of ""So. Central Rain"" featuring only Buck's guitar and vocals by Stipe and Mills. It's a moment fraught with tension and precariousness, especially when Stipe rolls in a few lines from ""Time After Time (Annelise)"". Some might find the absence of Berry on the song eerily prescient, but truly it shows a band fearlessly embracing its own newfound success. ""The time to rise,"" as Stipe sings on ""Finest Worksong"", ""has been engaged.""</p></div>"|17079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17079-document/|8.2|Stephen M. Deusner

They were trotting out a truncated bit of ""West End Girls"", now 28 years old, whilst on the cusp of releasing their eleventh studio album, <i>Elysium. </i>The videos for new songs <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n609XaagVJo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Invisible""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7dBVXiydR8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Winner""</a>, are elegantly conceived and executed, and so is the packaging associated with<i> </i>the record and its singles. They have all the design sensibility anyone could want in a pop act. If only they'd put the same vigor and power into their new songs, they might be on to something.</p>
<p>As always, the Pet Shop Boys' latest studio LP has a resonant single-word title. ""Elysium"" is a reference to Elysian Park, near where they recorded the album in Los Angeles, but it's also a high-class sort of word for paradise, in the specific sense of the afterworld of the blessed. The implication is that, somewhere in there, Pet Shop Boys slipped into the great beyond, and Neil Tennant is now singing to us from the other side. But Tennant and Chris Lowe's relationship to pop and its audience has changed over time, and not in a loss-and-beatification way. For Pet Shop Boys' first decade or so, they were impostors so studious and inspired that they were better than the real thing. Now they've settled into being elder statesmen of pop at a time when pop has little use for elder statesmen, and they're off-puttingly bitter about it.</p>
<p>Their self-consciousness is overtly the subject of <i>Elysium</i>'s two worst songs: ""Your Early Stuff"", whose title gives away its only good joke, and ""Ego Music"", a slapdown of fake-humble stars (""There's a real purity to my work, a childish innocence..."") that's a diluted variation on the theme of 1993's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG5oi1FGf_I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shameless""</a>. And it keeps coming up in Tennant's lyrics, one way or another. ""It's queer how gradually I've become invisible,"" he croons: That's most obviously a commentary on being a gay man in his 50s, but it's hard to miss the suggestion that he's talking about his position on the charts.</p>
<p>Lowe has <a href=""http://www.theartsdesk.com/new-music/theartsdesk-qa-pop-duo-pet-shop-boys?page=0,1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">suggested</a> that he'd have preferred there to be ""no fast songs at all"" on this record, and the quietest songs on <i>Elysium</i> are generally the best, especially the heart-on-sleeve ""Memory of the Future"". (There's one full-on dance track here, ""A Face Like That"", whose fake-orchestral stabs and strobing single-note synth bass make it sound like an outtake from the <i>Actually</i> era, but its melody is instantly forgettable.) Tennant's mature gift as a lyricist is for sentimentality tempered by slyness, and he pulls that off a few times: ""<a href=""http://www.nickelinthemachine.com/2008/04/ossie-clark-the-king-of-the-kings-road-in-holland-park/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ossie's</a> last collection/ <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/britishstylegenius/content/21803.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Biba's</a> closing sale/ A little more rouge on powdered cheeks/ But the base is pale,"" he sings in ""Requiem in Denim and Leopardskin"", an elegant tribute to the late makeup artist Lynne Easton that's also a tender remembrance of the London of Pet Shop Boys' prehistory. (It's no <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtjFsFXU9YU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Being Boring""</a>, but one can only write <a href=""http://www.10yearsofbeingboring.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Being Boring""</a> once.)</p>
<p>Too much of <i>Elysium</i>, though, misplaces its subtlety. There's no suggestion that ""Hold On""--adapted from a piece by George Frideric Handel-- is anything more than a vaguely inspirational lighter-waver, for instance, and the arrangement's alternating male and female choirs are corn syrup poured on cotton candy. Is there some covert archness to it, some enormous conical hat peeking out from behind its bromides and bombast? Or does Tennant and Lowe's vision of paradise really consist of unpunctured spectacle?</p></div>"|17032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17032-elysium/|5.4|Douglas Wolk

She struck up a conversation with the band's Kevin Parker after the show about how he achieved the band's signature, blown-out bass sound in particular, and a while later he asked My Bee's Garden to support Tame Impala on a European leg of their tour. Though her own band's sound was clean and somewhat precious, Prochet remained drawn to the Tame Impala aesthetic. So when she decided to go solo, she asked Parker to produce, and to push her out of her comfort zone a bit. ""I tend to write songs with pretty chords and arpeggios, and I was kind of boring myself,"" <a href=""http://www.noisevox.org/content/face-time-melodys-echo-chamber"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she recalled</a>. ""So I asked Kevin to destroy everything.""</p>
<p>Mission accomplished. Recorded mostly at Parker's home studio in Perth, the resulting self-titled debut from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30411-melodys-echo-chamber/"" target=""_blank"">Melody's Echo Chamber</a> is a record of psych-tinged pop with just the right amount of thematic darkness and grime around the edges. Prochet has a way with melody and a voice that places her among the top-tier graduates of the Trish Keenan and Laetitia Sadier school of dream pop, but it's Parker's signature production that helps this record transcend its forever-in-vogue 1960s pop influences. (""This record was my dream sound,"" Prochet said <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2012/08/an_interview_wi_74.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a recent interview.</a> ""I've tried for years to get it but finally found the right hands to sculpt it."") Full of immersive textures that give off an echoey depth and prismatic riffs that tumble through space, Parker's production grants this record its own laws of gravity.</p>
<p>The record's best songs tease out tension between soft and hard edges-- a combination of beauty and brittleness. Excellent lead-off single ""I Follow You"" pairs an exquisitely sugary melody with a fuzzy, syncopated riff, while the dreamy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13557-crystallized/"" target=""_blank"">""Crystallized""</a> detonates in its final moments into a kraut-y electro freak-out. Beginning with a toy-soldier beat and warmly warped synth tones, ""You Won't Be Missing That Part of Me"" blooms into one of the record's best moments, a kiss-off song that flips the usual script and takes the perspective of the heartbreaker rather than the heartbreak (""Because I lied with all my heart, because it's time to change my life... Hold on, you'll see it won't be that hard to forget me."") Parker's production is perhaps at its most stunning on ""Some Time Alone, Alone"", on which Prochet's arpeggios rain down like a chandelier being hit with a sledgehammer in slow-motion.</p>
<p>The shards occasionally prick: ""Mount Hopeless"" is fittingly gloomy, and there's even a song about post-plane crash cannibalism called ""Snowcapped Andes Crash"". But for as odd and chilling as that song sounds on paper, it falls flat in execution, languishing on a Side B that doesn't quite have enough ideas or surprises to save from some repetitive lulls. Prochet hasn't quite figured out how to do anything interesting with the macabre that lurks somewhere in this record's sound, and it leaves you wishing she'd explored <i>Melody's </i>dark side a little more, à la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Broadcast</a>'s creepy masterpiece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/948-tender-buttons/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tender Buttons</i></a>. Of course, Prochet's melodies can't quite fill the Broadcast-shaped void left in the wake of Keenan's untimely death, but Melody's Echo Chamber is one of the more satisfying records to bear that band's influence in recent years. For a collaboration between a songwriter and a producer who helped push her to the outer limits of her vision, <i>Melody's Echo Chamber</i> is an impressively immersive debut.</p></div>"|17095.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17095-melodys-echo-chamber/|7.4|Lindsay Zoladz

But they've definitely had a signature style. Taking off from dub's radical reduction of reggae to bass and noise, post-punk's DIY appropriation of funk, and krautrock's hairy perversions of academic electronics, Tussle's minimalist beat contraptions were take-it-or-leave-it stark, and occasionally indistinguishable. But they definitely felt like the work of one specific unit. And their live-in-a-room reconstructions of Classic Moments in Left-Field Rhythms always had a garage band grit and art-rock wonkiness that gave them the potential to be more interesting than their more bound-to-the-dancefloor peers.</p>
<p>But they delivered on that potential a lot less often than you'd have liked them to. It wasn't exactly that if you heard one Tussle record you'd heard them all. But when those rhythms went slack, it could sometimes <i>feel</i> that way, considering the minor cosmetic mutations the band's sometimes arid, always instrumental, and all-beats-all-the-time attack had undergone since 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8250-kling-klang/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kling Klang</i></a>. It's hard to sell such stern and unchanging stuff to anyone but drum obsessives after an EP or two. Usually melody-free and sometime abstracted to the point of losing the funk entirely, it's easy to tune out when instrumental avant-dance records feel by-the-numbers rather than driven by some itchy compulsion that translated to the feel of the beats themselves.</p>
<p>The interesting twist on <i>Tempest</i> is that Tussle have seriously sweetened their sound. They may open with two forbidding slabs of digital dub-- the warm bass and corroded sonics suggesting a Jamaican studio outfitted with a souped-up Atari-- but for the most part this is the most luscious music Tussle have ever put their name to. The sound is always hazy or crisp just when it needs to be. JD Twitch of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3215-optimo/"" target=""_blank"">Optimo</a> gives this new Tussle's more orchestrated, more ornate sound an appropriately voluptuous sheen, but he's not gaudy about it. <i>Tempest</i> is an oasis of carefully deployed glitz after the desert-like emptiness of some of Tussle's past records.</p>
<p>And for a band that could come off like a bunch of groove-obsessed acetics, never resorting to excess (like <i>songs</i>) when they could bear down on the crisp interplay of drums and bass, much of <i>Tempest</i> is downright maximalist, at least in context. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13808-eye-context/"" target=""_blank"">""Eye Context""</a> is a kitchen-sink epic that throws in playground handclaps, disco whistles, prog keyboard whimsy, manic cowbell, New Order bass, hardcore rave stabs, and stuttering old-school techno drums. But it also manages to arrange that potential chaos into something resembling a song, with peaks and valleys, thrills and lulls, mood shifts and memorable moments. In other words it courts an audience beyond people obsessed with snare patterns, and it's the album's obvious highlight. But even the second-tier tracks try a little harder than usual. When they look back to their old off-kilter live drumming on ""Lightly Salted"", Tussle seemingly discover how expansive that egghead funk can feel if you suddenly add some sweet and sour texture, and a little cinematic style. ""Yellow Lighter"" even uses the human voice, a little snatch of deep house longing, though again you'd be fibbing if you tried to claim a snippet-sized sample as anything approaching a ""song.""</p>
<p>And that's what still limits <i>Tempest</i>'s appeal, much as it tries to escape Tussle's self-imposed Serious Dance Band limitations. They're still a group content to tastefully collage retro styles into almost-new and usually just-good-enough rhythm tracks rather than commit to the hard work of coining hooks, crafting melodies, or penning emotionally resonant lyrics. In other words, any of the less cerebral and more visceral stuff that makes dance music work as well in your home and heart as in the club. And at the same time, they're not willing to risk the alienation of true experimentation, either.</p>
<p>One of Tussle's biggest influences has always been <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2494-liquid-liquid/"" target=""_blank"">Liquid Liquid</a>, and they invited a couple of Liquid Liquid members to guest on <i>Tempest</i>. Comparisons to that monumental New York unit don't do any favors for Tussle. On their handful of epochal early-80s singles, Liquid Liquid could make chart-topping Latin disco moves feel as alien and eerie as anything on side three of <i>Tago Mago</i>, but they also so wrote basslines so forceful and catchy they could level mainstream dancefloors and get swiped for some of the biggest early hip-hop hits. Without that commitment to either pop immediacy or boundary-pushing weirdness, let alone being able to pull of both at once, Tussle are always going to feel like they occupy some kind of tepid middle-ground, however sharply their cymbals are recorded.</p></div>"|17078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17078-tempest/|6.0|Jess Harvell

The idea, as it was conceived by the music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5751-robert-hood/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Hood</a> and Jeff Mills (among others) in the mid 1990s, was never to strip music bare but rather to recreate the hip-wiggle of Kraftwerk, Afrika Bambaataa, and Juan Atkins with as little infrastructure as possible. It's fitting that this efficiency riddle was conceived in Detroit, a capitalist mecca conditioned to such puzzles. It's a concept that deserves a statistic: funk per beat (FPB), perhaps. Somewhere up on the FPB leaderboard would be Hood, an institution of Detroit techno's second wave, and a man whose <i>Minimal Nation</i> release in 1994 helped both name and define the predominant form of techno of the last 20 years.</p>
<p>It was the release that followed <i>Minimal Nation</i>, however, that many consider Hood's high-water mark: <i>Nighttime World Volume 1</i> retained Hood's trademark austerity, but it was pock-marked with jazz and made sidelong glances at house. It's a concept-- Hood isn't even getting out of bed if there isn't a concept involved-- that he returned to again in 2000 and yet again this year, with <i>Motor: Nighttime World 3</i>. Like many of his Detroit peers, Hood has been a media-shy recluse (the <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?901"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">last info I could find</a> had him living in a small, unnamed Alabama town), but unlike those peers he's been an extraordinarily productive recluse. <i>Motor</i> follows long, ambitious full lengths from each of the past two years, and those followed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11461-fabric-39/"" target=""_blank"">one of Fabric's rawest, most invigorating mixes</a>.</p>
<p><i>Motor</i> is reportedly inspired by the documentary film <a href=""http://documentaryheaven.com/requiem-for-detroit/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Requiem For Detroit</i></a>, a history of the city's auto industry. Detroit's skyline is tinted and mirrored on the album's cover (presumably to mimic a waveform), and it takes little imagination to read the city's plight into the album's song titles: ""The Exodos"", ""Hate Transmissions"", ""A Time to Rebuild"". As his work has progressed, Hood has eschewed the skeletal, nickel-plated simplicity of his mid-90s work; <i>Motor</i> is his most composer-ly work to date and without qualification one of his finest. It's a rangy, diverse set, its sawing synthesizers romantic and empathetic: Hood's affection for his hometown shines through.</p>
<p>Hood has never overstuffed his tracks, but in the past the space between his beats has felt compressed, cabin air allowed only so nothing suffocates. <i>Motor</i> is more generous. The tracks here unfurl luxuriously, taking in big, deep breaths and exhaling slowly. The younger, more militant Hood might have bristled at this softness; the older Hood understands that softness is required. Indeed, <i>Motor</i> is often ethereal and cinematic: the lush push/pull of ""The Exodos"", the gutty music box ""The Wheel"". ""Slow Motion Katrina"" is one of the most beautiful techno tracks of the year, a chopped and screwed siren laying groundwork for electric pianos to dawdle and spin.</p>
<p><i>Motor</i>, at roughly 79 minutes, is too long by half, but there's little else to complain of. Hood has been increasingly interested in longform, narrative techno, and <i>Motor</i> eclipses the entries in his similarly epic <i>Omega</i> series. <i>Motor</i> is less funky than Hood's earlier, revered works, but it relies on the same blueprints: spartan rhythmic patterns, no fat, no showboating. Big and contemplative, <i>Motor</i> is based on a cautionary tale, but like so much of the exploitative, journo-navel-gazing that has infested Detroit, it can't help but find some beauty in the wreckage.</p></div>"|17049.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17049-motor-nighttime-world-3/|7.3|Andrew Gaerig

Though they've turned into a versatile band comfortable in an array of styles, their roots are in garage rock, a sound that has a long history of mining the potential of brevity: It's a genre built on a foundation of singles, whose holy text is aptly titled ""Nuggets"", and whose philosophy is summarized by a song that went ""I hope I die before I get old."" Though Dum Dum Girls' latest EP, <i>End of Daze</i>, has a handful of gothic influences, its all-killer-no-filler concision feels like a tribute to the spirit that they've have been riffing on since their debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14054-i-will-be/"" target=""_blank""><i>I Will Be</i></a>. Unhurried but not a beat too long, <i>End of Daze </i>is a confident and comprehensive showcase for everything Dum Dum Girls do well, from luxuriant, moody ballads to driving, melodic guitar pop-- and after 18 minutes, it punches the time clock like somebody who just declared checkmate: Your move, every other band trying to sound like this.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time an EP has marked a turning point in the Dum Dum Girls' run. Last year's terrific, four-song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15156-he-gets-me-high-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>He Gets Me High</i></a> EP introduced a newfound Chrissie Hynde-like depth to Dee Dee's voice and new-car glimmer to the Girls' formerly lo-fi sound. It was a collection of cheery, upbeat songs about infatuation, except for the closing track -- a cover of the Smiths classic ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"". Bold is the band that thinks it can bring something new to the song that's launched a million mascara tears, but Dum Dum Girls pulled it off in grand style. Sandy's kick drum towered 10-stories high and Dee Dee sold the track's jet-black drama, uttering her chilling delivery of ""I want to see people and I want to see life"" like a member of the walking dead. Now, on <i>End of Daze</i>, they're now penning some dark gems of their own.</p>
<p>""I've dreamed a death/ It's mine tonight,"" Dee Dee drawls on the opener ""Mine Tonight"", which smolders slowly and purposefully for a minute and a half before bursting into a panoramic blaze. Like <i>Only in Dreams</i>, <i>Daze</i> is an exploration of the feelings triggered by the recent death of Dee Dee's mother. But while many of the songs on <i>Dreams</i> painted grief with a palette of simple descriptors and easy rhymes (""There's nothing to say/ At the end of the day/ I'm wasting away""), <i>Daze</i> expresses these emotions with more depth. Tears fall ""from desert eyes,"" home is ""a sweet prison,"" and both Satan and Icarus make cameo appearances. The lush, cavernous sonics produced by loyal Dum Dum Girls collaborators Richard Gottehrer and Sune Rose Wagner echo this step forward, too. Sonically and lyrically, <i>Daze</i> does <i>Dreams</i> one better by blowing personal sorrow up to a mythic scale.</p>
<p>From ""Mine Tonight"" to the wonderfully brooding cover of Scottish new wave duo's Strawberry Switchblade's ""Trees and Flowers"" (""I hate the trees and I hate the flowers, and I hate the buildings, the way they tower over me""), there's not a weak song in the bunch. But the last two in particular are perhaps the best Dee Dee's ever written. Dripping with conviction, longing and remorse (and set off by an instantly transfixing opening line: ""I want to live a pure life""), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13972-lord-knows/"" target=""_blank"">""Lord Knows""</a> has a melody so perfectly gratifying that you'd swear you've heard it before. And in some ways, you have; it quotes the chord progression of ""Crimson and Clover"", right down to the chiming riff that punctuates the end of each line in the verse. But ""Lord Knows"" inhabits its influences so fully and with such conviction that this familiarity only makes it that much more magnetic. It taps into the strange sorcery of the greatest rock'n'roll songs, possessed with the power to set the world in slow motion for four commanding minutes.</p>
<p>""Season in Hell"", on the other hand, kicks earth back into its orbit. A distorted riff quivers, and then Sandy's echoey, galloping beat drives the song forward. It is a song about the moment when your grief becomes portable, the necessity of continuing to mourn but also carrying on. It's a simple, emotionally sophisticated line from a band not generally lauded for their lyrics, but, coming at the end of a smartly sequenced narrative about darkness and redemption, its conclusion is that much more affecting: ""Doesn't dawn look divine?""</p>
<p>Garage rock is also a genre of quick burnouts, its best compilations scattered with one- or no-hit wonders whose most explosive fireworks burned bright for three minutes before vanishing altogether. So perhaps the most profound way that the Dum Dum Girls have transcended their influences is the simple fact that they've stuck around, pushed past their limits, and gotten that much better. <i>End of Daze</i> is their best release. Much more than a stop-gap between LPs, it's succinct but irrefutable proof that this band's dynamite has a long fuse.</p></div>"|17084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17084-end-of-daze-ep/|8.3|Lindsay Zoladz

Parts of his discography read like <i>Spinal Tap</i> for dance music: In 2006 he released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9816-fizheuer-zieheuer/"">a track that looped Serbian brass bands for about 37 minutes</a>, and a year later, he made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10688-fabric-36/"">a mix for the London club Fabric</a> consisting entirely of new Ricardo Villalobos productions, which is like giving a toast at someone's else's wedding about your own marriage. Halfway through the mix, a woman starts angrily delivering her opinions on how to deal with chicken giblets. Then the big Japanese drums come in. From where, it's unclear. In Villalobos tracks, all doors are trap doors. The music he makes is loose, chaotic, and highly detailed, but the overall effect of it is like watching traffic: In the end, nothing really happens. His gift, though-- and this is where the worshipers start to worship-- is that a different kind of nothing seems to happen every time.</p>
<p>His output from 2006 to 2012-- which is basically the moment he waded into the deep end-- is a catalog of extremes: On the one hand, you get these long, linear, endlessly unfolding pieces of music like his Fabric mix; on the other, you get 37 absurdly repetitive minutes of Serbian brass bands. <i>Dependent and Happy</i>-- a series of five vinyls or one CD that picks up where the Fabric mix left off-- is his most substantial solo release in five years, and basically an extension of the kind of music he started making on the Fabric mix. Over the course of its 80 minutes, we hear people talking, cars honking in the street, and someone playing the bongos. Naturalistic sounds blend into synthesized ones, and synthesized sounds imitate the natural world. Villalobos wanders in to play a few notes and then disappears again.</p>
<p>There comes a point in listening to his music that almost any sound feels like it might belong. That's the exciting thing about it. That's the disorienting thing about it, too. <i>Dependent</i> cements a slow evolution from left-field house music to something like sound collage or electroacoustic composition pinned to a house beat. Every element is carefully managed, but the outcome mimics that haphazard feeling of real life. And like life, <i>Dependent</i> moves in a straight line. Whatever repetitions are there feel accidental, like a trick of perception. (Your brain, after all, craves patterns, and will make them whether you like it or not.) Even drums-- techno's anchor-- can vary from bar to bar, sprouting weird extraneous noises as they go. </p>
<p>Given the open nature of the music, the tracks that seem easily excerpted from <i>Dependent</i> are also the ones that feel most out of place while listening to it as a whole. ""Put Your Lips"", for example, is as good a place as any to sample what it is Villalobos sounds like in 2012, but when it comes up int he course of the album it feels self-contained-- a strange quality when the beauty of the music is how radically open it sounds. In the end, it's the looser tracks that form the album's backbone. When I first put the needle down on ""Tu Actitud"", I thought the record had been cut wrong. The music seems to start <i>in medias res</i>-- like it's always been there, but you, the listener, just fell into it.</p>
<p>I hesitate to be prescriptive about these things, but both the vinyl and digital experiences are great in their own ways: Digitally, you can just let the music run, which can be more hypnotic; on vinyl, having to change sides every 12 minutes or so is a constant reminder of just how substantial the set is. Over the past few years, Villalobos has become almost mystically preoccupied with sound. ""There is a fairly strictly limited range of frequencies available for the production of electronic music,"" he mused in a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ofg9ioa3h88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2011 interview</a>, surrounded by very nice-looking speakers that resemble the bells of trombones. ""When you 'marry' these with all these acoustic recordings that have all these atmospheric spaces, it is in some ways a complementation of the things that electronic music lacks.""</p>
<p>In <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1128"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">other interviews</a>, he's talked down software like Ableton, which offers pre-programmed instruments at affordable prices that Villalobos, with his impossible ears, can identify in ""two seconds."" Instead, he uses <a href=""http://www.weblogsinc.com/common/images/7291976986464054.JPG?0.6019339706458597%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">modular synthesizers</a>, building each electronic element from raw wave forms. Bar soap? No. He makes his own. (Maybe now is the time to mention that the vinyl edition-- i.e., the one for the hardcores-- has three extra tracks, all of comparable quality to anything else on the CD version. Villalobos, of course, encourages attentive listening; most of the vinyl only has one track on each side, which is a very different experience from listening to it as an almost continuous block of sound.)</p>
<p><a href=""http://nightclubber.ro/wp-content/uploads/Villalobos-670x502.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Basically, he's a snob</a>. He's monkish in his austerity. There's also nobody making the kind of music he's making right now. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15797-re-ecm/"">last year's collaboration with Max Loderbauer</a> re-imagining tracks from the catalog of German jazz label ECM, <i>Dependent</i> breaks down genre and expectations, but does it with a polite kind of confidence. It recalibrates the ear. Maybe it's appropriate to assess it like a drug: Side effects may include a heightening of sensitivity to the sound of the world around you. Call his tracks ""environments""-- my guess is, he would. In them, even melody-- one of the most basic components of music-- can sound totally foreign. It's true that destruction can be an act of creation, but the same goes the other way around: In building, Villalobos, with his big ideas and cheerful disposition, tears down.</p></div>"|17156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17156-dependent-and-happy/|8.2|Mike Powell

I don't know if I can even work with these [Cuban musicians] because they're on a totally different level musically, and I feel so inferior, but then you play them something of yours, and it's not that they feel the same exactly, but they don't know how you created what you created. So you're both in an unknown, so to speak.""</i>—Mala, to <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2012/06/10/havana-meets-south-london-the-story-of-mala-in-cuba/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>FACT</i></a>, on the origin of his debut LP.</p>
<p>On the new album <i>Mala in Cuba</i>,<i> </i>the dubstep pioneer sets himself to an ambitious task.  Challenged by musical sage Gilles Peterson to mix soundsystem culture with the traditional melodies and instruments of Cuban music, Mala traveled to Havana to retrieve those sounds from their source, on a kind of musico-anthropological expedition. And though the album doesn't work in many places, it's a laudable attempt to mix together two styles which are, at first appearance, utterly alien to one another.   </p>
<p class=""p1"">If anyone has earned the right to try his hand at bringing such disparate worlds together, it's Mala. The man is to dubstep what Primo is to boom-bap: a living legend with as much influence as any single artist in defining a beloved sound. The difference between the two producers, and the reason that LP-devotees haven't heard of Mala, is that dubstep, as a dance genre, is powered by the single. Mala's never even released a full length record before-- only singles and dubplates.</p>
<p>That this is Mala's first proper album is a key to the record's problems-- he's mentioned in past interviews that he's uncomfortable working within the confines of the long player. He's not used to making separate tracks cohere to each other, and the discordance between songs on the album makes for transitions that are less seamless than they ought to be.</p>
<p>For instance, take the first two songs released from the album about a month and a half ago.  The B-side, ""Calle F"", is a wonderful makeshift jam session, bringing together driving bass with keys and snappy Cuban snares. It's highly atmospheric with huge amounts of space to complete the vibe. On the other hand, the A-side, ""Cuba Electronic"", is dark and dense, with a grating automated sampled bark that adds to a general urban dissonance. </p>
<p>Fans of exotic musical collages like Madlib's <i>Speto de Rua</i>-- <i>Dirty Brasilian Crates Volume One </i>or Frankie P's <i>Hazy Nights in the Heights </i>will enjoy the former. Fans of Kode 9 and Skream will enjoy the latter. It would take a hell of a broad taste range to enjoy both, and even a listener with that eclectic a sensibility would have a hard time listening to ""Cuba Electronic"" and ""Calle F"" back to back. Though both are examples of extraordinary musicianship, they just don't work together.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mala had only one request of his coworkers. He asked Cuban jazz pianist Roberto Fonseca, his talented band, and other Cuban collaborators to play their music at his favorite tempo, the traditional 140 BPM. The producer then took those sounds home (apparently leaving the country with ""a hard drive's worth of music"") and toyed around with the samples for months on end, eventually bringing in his trusted friend Simbad to help validate his work.  But unfortunately, in the process of sculpting tracks, Mala couldn't seem to decide which part of the album's title to honor. Most of the tracks here are forced to pick sides between ""Mala"" and ""in Cuba.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">""The Tourist"" is a slightly distorted version of a son montuno, a subgenre of Cuban folk much admired for the way it swirls together the cooperative strings of bass guitar and piano. And even though we know that Mala is behind the boards, he never seems willing to enter the fray.  The opposite is true on ""The Tunnel"" where the upbeat Havana drums at the bottom of the mix are completely overwhelmed by blaring synth, rendering their presence entirely moot.  </p>
<p>However, there are a few tracks on which Mala gets the mix exactly right. ""Change"" is one of these, a heady brew of spacious keyboards, dubstep thump, and beautiful Cuban brass.  ""Changuito"", which features and is named after the OG Cuban percussionist finds the two drum masters riffing off one another in a thrilling exhibition, two hyperbolic talents at play. And ""Ghost"", perhaps best of all, maintains the purity of Cuban handclaps and vocal exhortations while slowly blending in the ominous clouds of that weaponized DMZ sound.</p>
<p>But these rare cohesive exceptions highlight the larger problem with the majority of the album. That Mala frequently eclipses his collaborators here is no surprise-- after all, this is<i> </i>a Mala album. That they eclipse him the other half of the time is a good thing, too-- a sign that he's humble enough to let others take the lead. But when two admirable entities participate in a collaborative project, you expect to see two pairs of handprints pressed firmly into the concrete of the finished work. And too often here, one pair is missing, hovering just out of sight and leaving behind only the trace imprint of a couple of fingertips, a contribution so slight that it's barely even there.</p></div>"|17202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17202-mala-in-cuba/|6.6|Jonah Bromwich

Beginning with a summary of their two-decade output before dutifully plowing through a detailed song-by-song analysis, it was the sort of tome that other publications might reserve for the likes of Bob Dylan or, elsewhere, Arcade Fire. </p>
<p>And for a certain sect of heavy metal fans, Enslaved is that band. They have the heritage, after all; their 1994 landmark debut, <i>Vikingligr Veldi</i>, was released on Deathlike Silence Productions just after the murder of label owner Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes. On that start, as in subsequent decades, they fundamentally altered the bounds of black metal, filling the form with enough baroque eccentricities and tangential song structures to push it from its provenance toward progressive rock. In the past decade, they've headlined the Netherlands' massive Roadburn twice, been consecrated by a tribute album, and won the Norwegian equivalent of a Grammy four times. So, yes, Enslaved are a big deal.</p>
<p>The trouble with the Obelisk's verbosity-- and, really, with most everything I've seen regarding <i>RIITIIR</i>-- is that its greatness feels like a foregone conclusion. ""Among <i>RIITIIR</i>'s impressive achievements, not falling apart halfway through has to be considered right at the top,"" reads one passage. ""Presumably though, if that fate was going to befall a band like Enslaved, it would've happened at some point before their 12th album in."" On Twitter, <a href=""http://twitter.com/AriseDrOv/statuses/240224045633781760"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one fan proclaimed </a><i>RIITIIR</i> a ""classic"" before hearing it, wondering if six consecutive masterpieces put Enslaved in a class of their own; <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/enslaved"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on Facebook</a>, when Enslaved themselves posted the Obelisk's preview, another fan confessed, ""Another great album like any other… can't wait."" Sometimes, a meaningful past can buoy the present, sight unseen or sound unheard.</p>
<p>But <i>RIITIIR</i> isn't a stenograph of Enslaved's earlier successes. For starters, it's the longest album of Enslaved's career. Where most of their records have inched toward the one-hour mark, this one shoots past it. And only three of its eight tracks don't break eight minutes; by comparison, among the 17 collective and very good songs on 2008's <i>Vertebrae</i> and 2010's <i>Axioma Ethica Odini</i>, none did. And this time, Enslaved's vocalists-- roaring co-founder Grutle Kjellson and relatively recent addition and melodic tactician Herbrand Larsen-- seem more like a tag-team, switching from cleanly sung choruses to misanthropic, blackened spits instantly and often. Toward the end of opener ""Thoughts Like Hammers"", in an antiphonal passage between the two, Kjellson growls, ""Motion remains our mother tongue."" It's an unintentional mantra for Enslaved on <i>RIITIIR</i>, a restless and sometimes laborious album that attempts to spotlight all of Enslaved's parts in one very overbearing package. For 67 minutes, one shift only gives way to another surprise, enabling an album that's busy enough to be called boring. </p>
<p>That doesn't mean that these 67 minutes are without their rewards. Enslaved are still very good at generating ideas, if not sequencing or filtering them on <i>RIITIIR</i>. The ferocious blast that begins ""Thoughts Like Hammers"", for instance, is rapturous. Several of Larsen's sections are sharp enough to be called catchy, too; indeed, throughout <i>RIITIIR</i>, many of the less claustrophobic moments offer a balmy respite in the midst of the spastic, ceaseless changes. At one point, ""Veilburner"" finds a surprising half-thrash pocket, serpent-tongued lyrics about metaphysical meltdowns spewed over a militant rhythm. ""Storm of Memories"" indulges a crypt-keeper krautrock essence for its first half, guitars sprinting around a drumbeat that always seems in search of an accelerant. But all of these songs eventually take on too much, stringing themes and variations together until the record becomes an endurance test. Before its nine minutes can end, ""Storm"" volleys between a few unadulterated black metal onslaughts, several slashing mid-tempo alt-rock sequences and a bit that sadly approaches effete stoner rock. What's worse, the transitions barely exist; <i>RIITIIR</i> moves with the enthusiasm and foolhardiness of work by a very average undergraduate composer.</p>
<p>Though it's the third longest track on <i>RIITIIR</i> and depends us much on Kjellson as it does on Larsen, definitive highlight ""Roots of the Mountain"" sidesteps most of the album's problems. Each part shifts into the other fluidly, and the segues between them, particularly the moment of mellotron after Larsen's first chorus, last long enough to provide tension. At song's end, Larsen and Kjellson sing together, the soft working against the serrated and vice versa as the band surges through the coda. This is the kind of arc that puts all of Enslaved's impulses in focus simultaneously, each allowing room and resonance for the other; unfortunately, on <i>RIITIIR</i>, it's the kind of arc that happens only once.  </p></div>"|17147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17147-riitiir/|6.4|Grayson Currin

The Los Angeles-by-way-of-San Diego quartet pitted bombastic rhythms against naive three-note hooks. Even when they got loud, singer/guitarist Matt Lamkin stayed cool and collected, delivering his cynical verses with a mellow slacker poise. The group's first batch of songs found a comfortable niche between the velocity of its hometown heroes, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1983-hot-snakes/"" target=""_blank"">Hot Snakes</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3588-rocket-from-the-crypt/"" target=""_blank"">Rocket From the Crypt</a>, and the slanted melodicism of New Zealand indie rock gurus <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"" target=""_blank"">the Clean</a>.</p>
<p>Two years in the making, the group's self-produced follow-up, <i>Strapped</i>, doesn't stray far from the established course, which is surprising given the record's gestation period. The band started with 80 rough sketches, 30 of which were completed, put to tape, and then whittled it down again to form the final product. The 12 tunes that made the cut suggest that, after a little bit of self-examination, the Soft Pack found the status quo perfectly palatable.</p>
<p>Rather than rearranging the component parts of their sound, <i>Strapped</i> finds the Soft Pack pursuing a strategy of sonic evolution via additional instrumentation. With its sturdy groove and jangling guitar hooks, ""Second Look"" could have easily slotted onto their debut. It's separated from its forebears only by the squawking of a saxophone, which turns up in time for the first chorus. On their debut, the Soft Pack's songwriting was refreshingly small-scale: A good hook and a heavy drum beat was sufficient fuel to get a song accross the finish line. On <i>Strapped</i>, the additional sonic window dressing-- the horns, the synth squiggles, and the wah-wah flourishes-- is never offensive, but it does feel superfluous.</p>
<p>But <i>Strapped</i> only really stumbles when the Soft Pack slow down. Lamkin is a fine vocalist, but he doesn't have much dynamic. He's either speak-singing in a calm and casual manner or, probably, busy playing guitar. So when the band drops down in intensity, his delivery gets mushy. On ""Bobby Brown"", Lamkin shoots for INXS-style grooviness, but comes off precious, rather than sexy. ""A menace, a bad thing to be, I've seen enough, heard enough, obscenity,""  he sings, on the maudlin <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14087-tallboy/"" target=""_blank"">""Tallboy""</a>, before demmanding a drink. If the band pushed the BPM a little higher, the song's pointed spirit self-examination might've had more teeth.</p>
<p>The Soft Pack's experimental turns pan out better when they keep their foot on the gas. On album closer ""Captain Ace"", wobbly guitar tones and psychedelic flourishes find harmony with the band's rythm section, riding a head-bobbing rhythm to an extended outro. Long and lush isn't a bad look for the Soft Pack, so long as they're keeping the beat.</p></div>"|17077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17077-strapped/|6.8|Aaron Leitko

People mention that Lou Barlow was dismissed and that he and J Mascis had clashes, but it felt darker than that. I went to one of Sebadoh's early shows during the tour for 1991's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7053-iii/"" target=""_blank"">III</a>;</i> Barlow was sour about being fired, and he punctuated songs with jokes about J Mascis. Pointed tunes like ""The Freed Pig"" were followed by pre-recorded taunts played on a portable tape deck, which usually targeted his former bandmate, or the situation in general. You imagined punches being thrown the next time they were in a room together. It's unclear where everyone is in the reconciliation process at this point-- Mascis isn't all that effusive outside his guitar solos-- but part of what's made Dinosaur Jr. a great band is the ongoing tension between the group's leaders. (For his part, the eternally mellow drummer Murph doesn't seem to be bugged by the bickering.) At this point, though, the drama isn't as interesting as the fact that the new albums-- 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10127-beyond/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beyond</i></a>, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13109-farm/"" target=""_blank""><i>Farm</i></a>, and now <i>I Bet on Sky</i>-- are all good to very good.</p>
<p>These days, bands getting back together to relive the glory days is nothing special. But it takes a certain kind of group to reunite and create vital music. In most cases, you have older bands solidly recreating their past (see: Mission of Burma); it's rarer to see artists with the ability to top what they did the first time around (see: Swans). Judging the dialog around the post-break Dinosaur Jr. records, J, Lou, and Murph are straddling the line between the two: On <i>Beyond</i> and <i>Farm</i>, outside small modernist details, they sounded very much like they did in the pre-<i>Green Mind</i> SST years. <i>I Bet on Sky</i>'s title offers a hint that they've gone in a slightly different direction for  album three (it's worth noting they've now matched their output of the first 80s run). The shift's easy to explain: <i>I Bet on Sky</i> feels like the material that emerged <i>after</i> Barlow was fired: 1991's underrated <i>Green Mind</i>, 1993's alt-rock crossover <i>Where You Been</i>, and the most commercially successful album, 1994's <i>Without a Sound</i>.</p>
<p>There's a softer, more spacious feel to those albums; if you go back to the 1985 self-titled debut, 1987's masterwork <i>You're Living All Over Me</i>, or 1988's also classic <i>Bug</i>, it's amazing just now noisy and claustrophobic those albums were. (It's there that they reminded you of their earlier days in the hardcore/punk band Deep Wound and Mascis' later work with the metal group Upsidedown Cross.) The albums after Barlow left had plenty of dirt and distortion-- especially <i>Green Mind</i>-- but they offered more space in the compositions, probably because Mascis suddenly had more space in general to work with. I'm always reminded of those 90s videos of him skiing or playing golf; you get that kind of cleaner vibe, nobody living all over him anymore.</p>
<p>That feeling continues onto the lilting, sunny <i>I Bet on Sky</i>.  The uptempo mid-album track  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14243-pierce-the-morning-rain/"" target=""_blank"">""Pierce the Morning Rain""</a> even sounds a lot like <i>Green Mind</i>'s opener ""The Wagon"", and <i>I Bet </i>is Dinosaur Jr's cleanest sounding album to date. The feel is laidback, and as Mascis promised during the pre-release press run, fairly ""funky."" He's has always had a knack for lodging hooks in his feedback, but these are some of his tightest pop songs: Tracks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13828-watch-the-corners/"" target=""_blank"">""Watch the Corners""</a> or opener ""Don't Pretend You Didn't Know"" bring to mind Built to Spill's warm, welcoming psychedelia. This time, outside the more plaintive ""What Was That"", the downcast vibe comes this time from a pair of Barlow tracks, the prototypical Sebadoh dust-kicker ""Rude"" and the jaunty, autumnal rocker ""Recognition"".</p>
<p>Throughout, Mascis' voice is calmer, less ragged; <i>Sky </i>sometimes feels like his acoustic album <i>Several Shades of Why</i> married to a fuller backing band. There's also a push beyond the basic guitar/bass/drums setup with a twinkling piano on""Don't Pretend"" and ""Stick a Toe In"". These tracks and the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnHybH_I6Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Baby Britain""</a> bounce in general bring to mind what Elliott Smith did when he decided to indulge his Beatles obsession on <i>XO</i>. This is not a complaint: It goes well with the graying hair. All in all this is a kinder, gentler Dinosaur-- you won't have another ""Severed Lips"", sorry-- making a very solid album, one that finds the band gelling with half the fuzz. It's a subtle shift, but this is neither a move away from their sound nor toward the raging rock of old (even with all those warm-and-fuzzy Mascis guitar solos). In the sprawling, happy anthem ""I Know It Oh So Well"", Mascis asks, ""Is there light ahead?"" Judging from the music here, the answer is a resounding yes. </p></div>"|17050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17050-i-bet-on-sky/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

She's a quintessential one-hit wonder for the digital age-- a girl who accidentally recorded a near-perfect pop-rap hit and followed it with a hollow thud of a record. If her breakout YouTube single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1344-gucci-gucci/"" target=""_blank"">""Gucci Gucci""</a>, tore a hole in the conventions of pop and hip-hop, <i>Somethin' Bout Kreay</i> is the awkward seam that sticks out once someone has tried to sew it back up with some expensive twine.</p>
<p><i>Somethin' Bout Kreay</i> would elicit the embarrassment of, say, walking in on a younger sibling dancing awkwardly in front of her bedroom mirror, were its shrill clatter not so forcefully distracting. These are dance songs so strident that no one could ever hope to move to them, pop songs so thin that no one could choose lines worth singing along to, rap verses so fumbly that practically anyone could rewrite them and make them better. Excepting ""Gucci Gucci""-- which shoots out of the mess like a geyser of glitter-- each track can be appreciated primarily for the relief it offers from the previous clunker. To put things into perspective, Lil Debbie, Kreayshawn's mannequin twin of a sidekick, is currently making music miles catchier than <i>Somethin' Bout Kreay</i>, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a> and Kreayshawn associate V-Nasty's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16133-baytl/"" target=""_blank""><i>BAYTL</i></a>, lyrically speaking, might as well be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15725-watch-the-throne/"" target=""_blank""><i>Watch the Throne </i></a>in comparison. Imagine watching the ""Gucci Gucci"" video for the first time and knowing that in the near future-- just about a year later-- you'd be nostalgic for how traditional, how <i>authentic</i>, it felt. Time can move in strange, unsettling ways.</p>
<p>While she's always been discussed in a hip-hop context, Kreayshawn doesn't so much rap here as half-sing or speak. She sounds as though she's been called on in class to read aloud, sometimes short of breath, often painfully off-key and off-beat (""beat"" here usually meaning a fizzy, atonal thump). The closest she comes to rapping is on the female-revenge anthem ""Left Ey3"", where her presence is almost offensively performative. ""I should key your car/ But I'd rather slap your mom/ Only a bitch could give birth to such a fuckin' dog,"" she shouts. Later in the song, during a rare moment of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"" target=""_blank"">2 Chainz</a>-like hilarity, she raps: ""I'm Lorena Bobbitt chillin' in your bed/ I'm Britney Spears off hella drugs/ And I just shaved my head.""</p>
<p>Elsewhere she's a deer in the headlights, lost and meandering through half-assed boasts about how much gold she's got, dismissing her haters and forcing out unmemorable lines that make zero sense. ""Them white girls keep on mobbin'/ Yeah we do, your chance is over/ But not to be my lover/ All them haters ask me what I'm doing/ I just simply tell them, 'Kreaysonic,'"" she says on ""K234YSONIXZ"", a song that is unlistenable in spite of a beat reminiscent of Salt-n-Pepa's classic ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4onJ7Z2MLI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Push It</a>"" and a hook pulled from J. J. Fad's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3nPLoODtGU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Supersonic</a>"". At some point, on tepid New Orleans bounce homage ""Twerkin'"", we even run into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"" target=""_blank"">Diplo</a>, a fish out of water, trying to rap: ""And we slow it down/ Slappin' on the bass/ Baby drop your booty down/ Til your booty's lower case,"" he mutters. </p>
<p>It would be difficult to argue that <i>Somethin' Bout Kreay</i> is a waste of Kreayshawn's talent, because talent has been something of a non-factor in her story. If anything, ""Gucci Gucci"" helped usher in an era of artists for whom ""talent"" is beside the point, artists who've triumphantly remapped a hierarchy of values so that charm, branding savvy, and novelty rule supreme. Kreayshawn is one of the first of these artists forced to reconcile her own wiles with tradition in the form of a full-length album on a major label. And the final product finds her allure and charisma entirely lost in translation.</p>
<p>Which is a shame, because in spite of all the dismayed chatter that has enveloped her since she arrived, Kreayshawn's charisma is a special force. Take, for instance, this joyful <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DephYuhASaE&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">montage of home videos</a> shot during her childhood and uploaded this summer, where she's pictured belting the lyrics to Nas' ""Oochie Wally"" alongside one of her girlfriends, pointing the camera toward a mirror, showing off her pets and her Playstation. It should feel familiar, hypnotizing even, to anyone (girls in particular) for whom youth included a lot of boredom, Top 40 radio, bulky camcorders, and a dial-up internet connection. A decade later, her antennae are still tuned to the same channels, her sensibilities still perfectly translating the whimsical stoned-kid-in-a-candy-store experiences of sitting on the internet, choosing outfits with your friends, and blasting the music that makes you happiest. That's the joy we couldn't take our eyes away from when we first learned who Kreayshawn was, and a joy that is entirely absent on her album.<i> </i>She may never get an opportunity to relocate it-- <i>Somethin' Bout Kreay</i> could very well be her first <i>and</i> last. </p></div>"|16912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16912-somethin-bout-kreay/|3.0|Carrie Battan

Their first, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10203-imagine-our-love/"" target=""_blank""><i>Imagine Our Love</i></a>, came out in 2007; at shows around the time of their debut, Becky Stark, the band's lead singer and general aesthetic ringmaster, flounced around onstage in gauzy pink dresses, warbling about love and light and roses. When I saw the band play in 2006, even the (male, otherwise stoic) drummer sported pigtails. The band's aggressive cuteness almost overshadowed the actual substance of their music-- wide-eyed theatrical-folk with a keen ear for mood and melody, hooks as big and bright as Stark's doe eyes.</p>
<p>These new songs are shadowy and spacy, a little bit lost, maybe even a tad sexy despite themselves-- all brighter and richer than their predecessors. The overall tonal shift could spark suspicions of identity crises born of trend-hopping, but the gap is bridged by everything Becky Stark has had her hands in over the past five years: performing in the dusky, tight-harmony trio the Living Sisters, recording some country songs with actor John C. Reilly, running a community choir in Los Angeles. It would be easy enough to call these ""side-projects,"" but it's more helpful to think of Lavender Diamond as just one nook in Stark's glitter-spackled pantheon of boundless creative joy.</p>
<p>Stark is such a force, her voice-- and by that I mean both her artistic perspective and her rich, bendy soprano-- so singularly beguiling that it's easy to forget there's anyone else involved in the band, but for the new album she's again corralled pianist Steve Gregoropoulos and drummer Ron Regé Jr. (he of the pigtails), plus producer (and OK Go frontman) Damian Kulash. (The album's out on OK Go's Paracadute imprint, too.) The record's palette initally seems to be less a palette and more like every pigment close at hand dumped onto a canvas at once, but with repeat listens a certain logic emerges, elements bobbing and weaving in and out of view-- a fuzzy horn section, a teasing metallic guitar, swooning strings, the ominous drone of some gargoyle chorus. There are hints of the plainclothes percussion and school-play piano that defined <i>Love</i>, but they're swaddled deep in sheets of warm neon fuzz. Stark's vocals have a tendency to get buried, too; her song structures are plagued by a nearly paralytic tendency towards lyrical repetition which, coupled with the haze of Kulash's production and the more understated delivery she often favors here, can have a soporific effect.</p>
<p>Love is still Stark's main lyrical concern, but here she fixates on its darker sides, its absence. ""Everybody's heart's breaking now,"" she laments on the opening track, her voice nearly cracking under the weight of all the world's sorrows; later, she's driven to desperation: ""If I gave away everything that I owned, would you come home, would you come home?"" It's hard not to compare this record's ""I Don't Recall"" with ""Oh No"", which opened the band's debut-- the phrase ""oh no"" leads off and is repeated throughout both songs-- but this is a subversion, not a retread. On the original, Stark countered heartbreak with precocious bombast: ""When will I love again?"" she asked over and over (and over and over), like love was a foregone conclusion requiring her only to stand with open wide arms until it came around the corner. But here we find Stark flat on her back, refusing to stand up, let alone brush herself off. ""The life we shared is gone/ And it's hard without you,"" she sings, her words and her voice heavy and frank.</p>
<p>There's nothing so unnerving as an optimist in defeat, and <i>Incorruptible Heart</i> sits with this tension-- at least in its first half. The record's sequencing is either totally obvious, totally smart, or a complete accident. Either way, Stark spends tracks one through seven in mourning, walking through fires alone, contemplating what went wrong and what might have been; perhaps appropriately, a track called ""Forgive"" is the turning point. The sun breaks free from the clouds and she's out spinning in the fields again: ""Oh my boys and my girls/ I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,"" she declares over a steady Spector drumbeat on ""Oh My Beautiful World"". Stark's back in love, or at least back in love with love itself. It would've been nice to see her languish in the mess instead of tidily packing it away, but man does she tie up some pretty bows.</p></div>"|17088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17088-incorruptible-heart/|7.0|Rachael Maddux

Combining string instruments with well-manicured electronics, their music drew easy comparison to the wide-scale vistas of Sigur Rós or Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and their work with such collaborators as the Amina string quartet and even the Danish National Chamber Orchestra pegged them as front-runners in the European wing of the burgeoning <a href=""%5Bhttp://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8778-indie-classica"" target=""_blank"">indie Classical movement</a>.</p>
<p>So it is hard not to be a little dismayed to see that Efterklang have settled for what is likely the least daring-- if perhaps not the least lucrative-- path going forward. Their earlier recordings featured a core group of eight to 10 members, with their numbers frequently strengthened further by additional guest musicians, massed choirs, and chamber groups. Beginning with their 4AD album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13972-magic-chairs/"" target=""_blank""><i>Magic Chairs</i></a> in 2010, however, Efterklang scaled down to a quartet and, since the departure of drummer Thomas Husmer, have continued on as a trio, with nearly everything organized around the unflavored vocals of singer/composer Casper Clausen. In the process of winnowing down, they have gradually re-crafted their style from sweeping orchestral panoramas into a more standard form of theatric indie pop with ornamental accompaniment. On their latest album, <i>Piramida</i>, this shift results in music that on its surface feels ambitious and sophisticated but which manages never to take any real chances.</p>
<p>Even in the group's current pared-down version, Efterklang still have an exceptional palette of sounds at their fingertips, and once again the list of guest credits is a long one-- violinist Peter Broderick, pianist Nils Frahm, a brass section from the Andromeda Mega Express Orchestra, and, yes, a 70-piece girls' choir. The album's concept is a grand one as well: <i>Piramida</i> takes its name from a distant Arctic Circle ghost town to which the members of Efterklang traveled in 2011 and gathered field recordings to incorporate into their new compositions. Despite the group's diligent labor, however, the amassed instrumental arsenal is too often put to exactly the sort of patient crescendos, stately percussion, and icy choral backup vocals that have long since become soundtrack clichés. It is not at all jarring, for instance, to hear ""Modern Drift"", one of Efterklang's better pop songs, as the score for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuZGlIoxh_U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an Audi commercial</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one of the genuine pleasures of Efterklang's music is that you never know what sound will be heard first on any given track. It might be a mournful swoop of brass, a gently loping drumbeat, or an unexpected splash of New Wavey synth. This variety does create, for the first listen or two at least, a small but crucial bit of dramatic suspense. Yet too often, once we've been drawn inside Efterklang's open environment, that sense of surprise and discovery is quickly abandoned as the music reverts back to safer indie pop climes, so that once again Efterklang can seem merely the frosty Danish cousins of Arcade Fire or Grizzly Bear.</p>
<p>On the opening ""Hollow Mountain"", a title that could serve as an uncharitable descriptor of the music here, the first thing we hear is an Arctic field recording of a struck and plucked metal oil tank. Soon these metallic sounds are combined with strings, drums, and a ghost-voices-from-a-glacier choir; it all sounds cool, especially if you know a little of the album's back story, but that initial field recording could just as easily be a music box recorded in studio. Either way, it's all swept aside soon enough to make way for the first of Casper Clausen's conventional pop choruses. (Efterklang's vocal melodies are never quite as majestic or memorable as their build-up might otherwise suggest.)</p>
<p>That's just one example of what goes wrong on <i>Piramida</i>. Overall, the album's a tug-of-war between the group's lofty conceptual ambitions and their strange aversion to actual musical risk-taking. As a result, <i>Piramida's </i>impact is a bit like that of an epic but disappointing Hollywood blockbuster-- the audience doesn't necessarily care how much work went into its creation; we just want to see the budget up there on the screen.</p></div>"|17087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17087-piramida/|5.7|Matthew Murphy

I visited the band's studio in the Red Hook neighborhood <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jun/16/brassland-record-label-new-york-the-national"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">last spring</a>, and it was the closest I'd come to a physics lab since leaving school; a basement full of what Sanchez termed ""cannibalized"" instruments, shedding or absorbing new components on their path to becoming something else entirely. As Joshua Love explained in his review of their debut full-length, 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14697-riposte/"" target=""_blank"">Riposte</a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14697-riposte/"" target=""_blank""></a> (made under a different spelling of their name), their inventing new instruments arose from necessity; finding one that would accommodate Arone Dyer's carpal tunnel syndrome, and making two people sound like a full band. Buke and Gase solved musical problems using Sanchez' background in making mad instruments for the Blue Man Group and Dyer's experience building bikes. With such a bold self-sufficient streak, it's not surprising to know that their last single, May's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13538-buke-and-gase-hiccup/"" target=""_blank"">""Hiccup""</a>, was released in ""sympathy"" with the Occupy movement.</p>
<p>Solution found, on this new EP (there's a full-length to follow early next year), Sanchez and Dyer set about executing control experiments, working within limitations that unexpectedly prove both fruitful and poignant for a band whose previous raison d'être had been making maximalism from within minimalist confines. <i>Function Falls</i> came about when <a href=""http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blogland/2012/may/22/all-covers-rainbow/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Radiolab</a> asked the band to cover <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a>'s ""Blue Monday"" for a compilation, which led Sanchez and Dyer into trying to write a song a day for a week. Their cover of the dance staple sounds as though it predates the original-- made in the bracing, clanking austerity of the industrial age rather than the burgeoning glamor of the early 1980s-- and the classic's insistent synthesizer line proves the perfect mettle for Sanchez's gase (a guitar strung with bass strings). Those steady, tugged bass parts underpin the other three songs here, a far cry from the bungeeing bottom-end bounce that defined <i>Riposte</i> and 2008's mini album, <a href=""http://bukeandgass.bandcamp.com/album/-"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>+/-</i></a>. Instead, <i>Function Falls</i> stands on the lip of the bridge, deciding whether to jump.</p>
<p>Where Buke and Gase's early releases were bristling and joyous-- doesn't ""[waking] up in a bundle of orgasm"" sound like fun?-- it's much harder to parse the emotion here. The band have described how the words to the opening song, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14024-misshaping-introduction/"" target=""_blank"">""Misshaping Introduction""</a>, were improvised, ""resulting in a slight lyrical disintegration,"" and true to form, the only part that's easy to pick out without a lyric sheet is ""Don't clear the air/ Better to love first."" The song's steady mechanical clank and the way Dyer sings in a downcast, quieter tone, all former yelps expunged, give the impression that the whole thing could go off at any second; it reminds me of the danger present in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">Annie Clark</a>'s work, particularly when she's playing dead in a visual. You stoop over, duped into concern, and bam!, she's got you by the throat.</p>
<p>""Fussrate"" puts out a little more easily, starting with a familiar monochrome tug-- they share a similar palette to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3763-shellac/"" target=""_blank"">Shellac</a>, and it's no surprise that Bob Weston has mastered their forthcoming full-length. Then one bastardized instrument or other poses as a Moog, making for an elegant segue into a regimented orchestral cacophony halfway between the most <i>in excelsis</i> parts of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/730-rhys-chatham/"" target=""_blank"">Rhys Chatham</a> composition and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"" target=""_blank"">Battles</a> circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10225-mirrored/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mirrored</i></a>.</p>
<p>Despite all this control, there's a danger present in the kind of industrial mechanical sound that Buke and Gase mine-- the tambourine in ""Tending the Talk"" sounds as if fashioned from a wreath of shivs, the effect on the guitar lending it a dull glitter, like a jagged piece of quartz lagged in dust. It's the brightest song on the record, but Dyer sings at her slowest and most soulful, repeating, ""this heart ain't too hard to guarantee,"" as half statement, half plea for understanding. She reaches a depth and insidiousness in her vocal that more than makes good on the band's excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4alzRqTHck"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covers</a> for the Our Band Could Be Your Life concert that took place in New York earlier this year. Even though it was the starting point for the record, their cover of ""Blue Monday"" sits at the EP's end, where Dyer's processed, neutered cries of ""How should I feel?"" seem to act as a kind of emotional release for the questioning tone and linguistic disintegration that came before.</p>
<p>On each of their releases to date, Buke and Gase have never been anything less than absolutely thrilling-- even if some of those thrills were a bit more firecracker-on-your-chair than others-- and it speaks volumes that, whether they're going for maximalist madness or something more contained, both tacks still pack the same exhilarating punch. In their case, letting function dictate form hasn't limited any of their expression; rather, it's just shown off another side of their considerable arsenal. It's rare to find a band that triumphs in aggression, emotion, and innovation. Their controlled experiments have elicited a rare alchemy.</p></div>"|17189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17189-function-falls/|7.8|Laura Snapes

On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14678-love-remains/"" target=""_blank""><i>Love Remains</i></a>, his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a> debut, they were pop and R&amp;B acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11978-ready-for-the-world/"" target=""_blank"">Ready For the World</a>, Shai, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14709-ecstasy-with-jojo/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Jackson</a>, and <a href=""http://howtodresswell.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-started-remembering-in-1989.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bobby Brown</a>. He's no less forthcoming about the inspirations behind his heartbreaking second LP, <i>Total Loss. </i>During the penultimate apologia ""Set It Right"", he provides a roll call: Ryan, Dan, Mama, Grandma, Francey, Robbie, Nicky, and the list goes on. None of them are famous, none are musicians. They're real people in Krell's life. Some have died (his uncle and best friend), others are living but have slipped out of view, many including himself are struggling with depression. So the title <i>Total Loss </i>gives you fair warning about what to expect. Where <i>Love Remains </i>drew much of its power from emotional suggestion and tactile sensation, <i>Total Loss </i>uses the common tools of pop expression-- four-minute songs, autobiography, choruses, confession-- to create a work of poignant and devastating art.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The cruel irony of <i>Total Loss </i>is that it finds Krell striving for directness and candor with family members who've become unavailable to him through breakups, depression, addiction, or death. The record's first lyric-- ""You were there for me when I was in trouble/ You could understand for me that life was a struggle""-- is addressed to Krell's mother and reprised later on. Otherwise, the listener is in the position of the ""you"" populating so many of Krell's thoughts.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The sleek, alabaster sound of <i>Total Loss</i> is a far cry from the heavily distorted and distant <i>Love Remains</i>. That album wasn't considered a drug record for the same reasons Ambien isn't considered recreational, but its shrouded production mimicked the effect the drug can have when it starts to kick in: the sensation of controlling yourself in an out-of-body experience. That feeling is foreign to <i>Total Loss.</i> It's still flooded with reverb, but the anesthetic is gone.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">As a result, <i>Total Loss </i>feels subject to heightened sensitivity both sonically and lyrically, and the effect is made more unnerving by the sharp, sudden movements of its elements-- harp plucks, ticking hi-hats, slapped snares and, of course, Krell's own voice. It's high, thin, and boyish, but in no way timid. His quavering falsetto creates an intriguing friction against the newly aggressive, seething tone of his lyrics, particularly when he grapples with the self-blame, hopelessness, and betrayal that survivors of suicide victims often experience. ""Say My Name or Say Whatever"" begins with a recording of a homeless teen from the 1984 documentary <i>Streetwise</i> describing the freeing effects of flight. ""The only bad part about flying,"" he says, ""is having to come back down to the fuckin' world,"" a projection of Krell's own idealism and disillusionment.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Though it contains <i>Total Loss</i>'s<i> </i>most visceral, even sexual music, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13905-cold-nites/"" target=""_blank"">""Cold Nites""</a> sounds downright angry. The hook boasts, ""But I keep on doing it/ Ain't gonna stop until we're through with this,"" and it's an anger born from Krell's perception of his own shortcomings-- ""Tell me what I've got to do to get better.""  Album opener ""When I Was in Trouble"" is a piano hymn that takes its cues from William Basinski's <i>Disintegration Loops</i>, decaying in real time. Krell moans, ""Dear Mama, didn't you try to tell me everything was going to be safe?"" and then repeats the line in a rare lower register. The effect is chilling, and indicative of the confusion that permeates <i>Total Loss</i>: Whether Krell is trying to find relief in hurting himself or others is left open-ended.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Fortunately, How to Dress Well's malleability prevents Krell from getting too ponderous. If you found his orchestral direction on last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15676-just-once-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Just Once</a></i> promising, there's the string interlude of ""World I Need You, Won't Be Without You (Proem)"" which is reprised on the emotive centerpiece ""Talking to You"". <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14177-it-was-u/"" target=""_blank"">""&amp; It Was U""</a> pulls a similar deception, as Krell's accumulating harmonies disguise an imploding relationship over joyous new jack swing. It maybe lacks the shock of his earliest singles, and that's fine: Coming from someone discovering that his love for a style of music and his ability to pay it homage are starting to intersect, it's every bit as promising.   </p>
<p class=""p1"">The rhythmic backbone of <i>Total Loss</i>'s second half slackens a little, which can make the album feel frontloaded on the first few passes. Though <i>Love Remains </i>was more of a compilation than a proper album, its highlights were spread out judiciously. <i>Total Loss </i>doesn't fully compensate for its lack of clear standouts like ""Decisions"" or ""Ready for the World"", but it does benefit from a narrative cohesion that <i>Love Remains </i>lacked. Its path of grief follows psychology's Kübler-Ross model in chronology, from denial to bargaining to something resembling acceptance-- the lyric sheet even shows a smiley-face emoticon appending the ""Set It Right"" line, ""as far as love goes, it's one step at a time."" ""Struggle"" revisits Krell's love for blown-out reverb, obscuring gut-punch lyrics that attempt to reconcile the joys of reckless behavior with that sort of action's deadly, consumptive attraction: ""I remember drinking with you in your bed… But in the morning we'd go and start again."" And while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13650-ocean-floor-for-everything/"" target=""_blank"">""Ocean Floor for Everything""</a> wasn't a stunning first single, erring too close to melodies Krell has used before, it's an apt sendoff for <i>Total Loss</i>, the point where the pain has settled in. But any hope here is implied. It's not explicitly a happy ending.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's a fitting conclusion to a record that is <i>very </i>lonely for Krell and risky for How to Dress Well. In light of the ""PBR&amp;B"" digs that initially circled <i>Love Remains</i>, it's notable that many of the most exciting artists to arrive in its wake (the Weeknd, Jessie Ware, AlunaGeorge) are nominally ""indie"" but incorporate modernist R&amp;B in a similar manner. Krell hasn't benefited much from that swell of momentum, operating in a space that's far more niche and less overtly ""pop,"" in both genre and populism. But <i>Total Loss</i> is similar to the xx's <i>Coexist</i> in retreating to further minimalism and introspection after a groundbreaking debut. It feels like more of a success because there's no dissonance between its artistic intent and its optimal home-alone listening experience. Its effectiveness is a result of its intimacy-- or, as Krell puts it on ""Set It Right"", being ""true to you, I'm true to me, too.""</p></div>"|17046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17046-total-loss/|8.4|Ian Cohen

Ask duo <a href=""http://towhomitmayconcern.cc/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iamamiwhoami</a>, who've gotten an idea. The project had an unusual roll-out. In December 2009, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPFM3DUVT-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a video</a> emerged from nothing, followed by a few more. Each was striking in its mystery. They were short, a minute or so each of slow clips: the sort of forest where murders happen; a muddied woman looking and acting as reptilian as possible; silhouettes of owls and goats; various substances oozing. They came off like horror films, but the atmospheric sort where the queasy imagery provides all the scare. Each was scored to chilly, vaguely creepy synthpop; each was flagrantly anonymous. The track titles were just strings of numbers, and the project name all but taunted viewers to guess an identity. They did, en masse, naming seemingly anyone arty, Scandinavian, or blond: Karin Dreijer, Björk, Goldfrapp, Lady Gaga. (At one point Christina Aguilera looked like a frontrunner, which is now hilarious.) Bloggers were mailed locks of hair and chunks of wood. Viewers spent hours comparing faces and analyzing messages with cryptographers' fervor. The music hit iTunes, right on schedule. Everything was set for a big reveal.</p>
<p>That was 2010, and the reveal happened soon enough, though it's not overly revelatory. The vocalist is Jonna Lee, a Swedish folkie of not much prior note, produced by Claes Björklund, whose credits mainly included Lee, other folkies, and electronic but tranquil sorts like Azure Blue. If the names were surprising, it was only because they'd been on almost nobody's radar before this. Lee and Björklund continued to release videos, and later full songs. But their initial excitement-- a sort of musical alternate reality game that arguably influenced later acts like the Weeknd with highly stylized, highly anonymous debuts-- inevitably waned with time, as viral projects unfailingly do. It all provides enough material for one of those protracted debates about authenticity (an opaque sonic, aesthetic, and identity makeover from little-noticed stuff? Sounds familiar), reach (a standard Jonna Lee album probably wouldn’t have escaped the Scandinavian music sphere without luck or prime positioning), and evolving distribution methods (self-explanatory), but that time has passed. Now we have an album. </p>
<p><i>Kin</i> is billed as an audiovisual project-- videos were released for every song over the year, designed to be viewed in order, and the album was released with an accompanying DVD. But as was probably inevitable, they're far less compelling as a cohesive story than as a set of clues. A summary: Lee, half-dressed, gets kidnapped by yetis, taken over hill and dale and sea and rooms blank enough for Terry Richardson, dancing as she goes, and becomes a black cube somehow. The end. It's interpretive dance without interpretation, and anything the videos do to enhance the project has been done already, as preview material. At this point, <i>Kin</i> stands or falls on its songs alone. Fortunately, that mostly works.</p>
<p>It takes a little calibration to listen to <i>Kin </i>as a proper album, but it's doable. The distribution might have been unconventional, but the division of labor is familiar enough: Lee's voice, distorted and processed like Dreijer and her now-countless acolytes, and Björklund's production, lush and nuanced. ""Sever"" is distant and downtempo; the instrumentation even comes with accompanying rainfall. ""Drops"", ""Goods"", and ""Good Worker"" are straightforward dance tracks, sweetened with chiming keyboard lines; the last even has equally straightforward conceit (""who am I, when all I am is your designated wife?""). ""In Due Order"" is seething and almost industrial, as if Austra re-recorded one of lead singer Katie Stelmanis' edgier solo tracks. ""Idle Talk"" is an anthemic love track kept dormant; at least three times, you can hear Lee try to launch a soaring chorus over the moody synth bass and skewed structure. She succeeds on ""Play"", the closest thing here to a proper lead single and as close to R&amp;B as this genre typically allows-- it's not hard to imagine someone like AlunaGeorge recording it-- but lurching, woozy. ""I cannot move to my own beat,"" Lee sings, more languid than necessary, ""but I can dance tonight... and to your rhythm I will shout my love for play""-- at which point her voice twirls off into wordless Liz Fraser curlicues, meter by the wayside. It's not hopeful, exactly-- the lyrics are too self-negating for that-- but it's among the most purely joyful moments of the year.</p>
<p><i>Kin</i> isn't perfect-- Lee's lyrics tend toward the opaque, and Björklund's arrangements toward the meandering. (The video, meanwhile, is almost entirely so, on both counts.) But it's not anticlimactic, which is impressive considering its long gestation period and the fact that half these songs have been out for months. <i>Kin </i>is not an assertive album, nor is it surprising, but it's as solid an aesthetic as you can expect of two artists mostly new to this genre. Lee and Björklund have established that they can make headlines. <i>Kin </i>establishes they can craft songs, too. </p></div>"|16722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16722-kin/|7.6|Katherine St. Asaph

And as that 2010 reunion tour-- which coincided with extensive reissues of the band's 90s-era catalog-- continued to rack up positive notices well into 2011, there was little doubt that, even well into their 40s, frontman Jon Spencer, guitarist Judah Bauer, and drummer Russell Simins still possessed the stamina of their twentysomething selves.</p>
<p>However, what the Blues Explosion could bring to the table as a rebooted recording act was far less certain. From their 1991 debut through to 1998's <i>Acme</i>, the band had undergone a dramatic evolution from no-waved scuzz-punks to studio-savvy funkensteins, but one that had seemingly run its course as they entered the new millennium: 2002's <i>Plastic Fang</i> saw the band awkwardly try to temper its sound into '70s-Stones suaveness (tellingly, it's the lone Matador JSBX release to not receive the reissue treatment), while 2004's <i>Damage</i> reverted back to the <i>Acme</i> game-plan of enlisting a supporting cast of hip-hop heavyweights (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1113-dj-shadow/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Shadow</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/173-dan-the-automator/"" target=""_blank"">Dan the Automator</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7233-chuck-d/"" target=""_blank"">Chuck D</a>), but in a manner that ultimately normalized the band's sound rather than redefine it. So a new Blues Explosion album in 2012 presents no obvious game plan. Do they make a sleek, radio-friendly blooze-rock album in attempt to muscle in on some of them <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"" target=""_blank"">Black Keys</a> bucks? Do they try to score cred points with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"" target=""_blank"">Ty Segall</a> set by revisiting their early-90s avant-noise roots? Or, given the Blues Explosion's track record of reconstructing black musics ranging from Mississippi Delta blues to <i>Shaft</i>-esque funk to NYC rap, do they try to put their own absurdist spin on contemporary R&amp;B?</p>
<p>With <i>Meat and Bone</i>, the answer is: none of the above. Which is the best possible outcome, really: The Blues Explosion barrel through the album's 12 tracks as if they have no legacy to uphold, no expectations to live up to, and nothing to lose. Stripped of the cut-and-paste studio trickery and celebrity cameos that defined the band's records from the mid-90s onward, the self-produced <i>Meat and Bone</i> boasts no ambition beyond capturing the Blues Explosion in straight-up, no-bullshit rock'n'soul mode. It essentially provides them with a chance to rewrite their post-<i>Acme</i> history, and posit the question: what if the botched back-to-basics mission of <i>Plastic Fang</i> was salvaged by the maniacal gusto of <i>Extra Width</i>?</p>
<p>If anything's really changed here, it's that Spencer sounds genuinely humbled. In the early 90s, the Blues Explosion were distinguished not only by their fondness for the sort of blues-based tradition from which so much punk and indie rock tried distance itself, but also by Spencer's penchant for hip-hop-inspired self-aggrandizement; ""Blues Explosion"" was not only his band's name, but his most utilized lyric, as if he were practising a form of inter-song product placement. But with <i>Meat and Bone</i>, pretty much the only ""Blues Explosion"" you get is printed on the album cover, and Spencer's banter here-- ""Are you ready for your new career? Need a J-O-B,"" ""I feel like a god/ But I still got a problem paying the rent""-- leans toward the self-deprecating musings of someone who's aware he's no longer the king of the scene.</p>
<p>Amid a 90s indie rock environment that frowned upon rock-star posturing, Spencer's shameless shout-outs to himself came off as playfully arrogant, if not outright provocative. But Spencer understands it's the sort of rhetoric that holds less power today, when self-promotion isn't so much a cheekily effective way to assert a persona as a practical necessity for any aspiring indie act. So on <i>Meat and Bone</i>, the focus is less on theatrical myth-making than reasserting the band's real-deal bona fides: three men in a room making one big racket. While ""Bag of Bones"" and the <i>Orange</i>-tinted ""Get Your Pants Off"" suggest the band haven't unlearned all of their funk finesse, <i>Meat and Bone</i> gradually forsakes its congenial groove for pure smash-and-grab insolence, hitting a feverish peak with the New York Dolls-damaged ""Danger"" and the contorted glam boogie of ""Black Thoughts"", on which Spencer seemingly sums up his time out of the spotlight by declaring, ""Without a doubt, this is the worst vacation I have ever been on!"" But what makes <i>Meat and Bone</i> a success-- despite simmering down into a mid-tempo murk during its home stretch-- is that the Blues Explosion never assume their comeback is assured. They're reapplying for the job of America's most raucous, hardest-working rock'n'roll band, and will let the sweat speak for itself.  </p></div>"|17056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17056-meat-and-bone/|7.3|Stuart Berman

He's on piano, of course, but that's the perfectly named Robert Sledge back on fuzz bass and Darren Jessee, a welcome presence on drums. For better or for worse, ""Erase Me"" has all the hallmarks of pre-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/645-the-unauthorized-biography-of-reinhold-messner/"" target=""_blank""><i>Reinhold Messner</i></a> BFF: the spry instrumental interplay that marks their best material but was sorely missed when the piano man went solo; the too-clever lyrics that mistake recrimination for emotion; and a sturm-und-drang that winks at metal but, you know, it's on piano so it's funny. Fifteen years ago, indie pop that used showtunes to take down the pretentions of indie pop sounded acceptably smartass. But what was fresh in 1997 sounds much less so in 2012. Post-a cappella self-tribute album, post-""The Sing-Off"" judging gig, post-diminishing-returns solo career, this reunion feels obligatory and uninspired-- an inevitable development that yields few memorable moments.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the prospect of a new Ben Folds Five album is only slightly more appealing than the prospect of actually revisiting those first three albums, which are about as mired in the 1990s as the cover of <i>The Sound of the Life of the Mind</i>. ""Brick"" and ""Song for the Dumped"" always wore their self-absorption and misogyny on the sleeves of their ironic t-shirts, and shit like ""Dick Holster"" and ""For Those of Y'all Who Wear Fannypacks"" was self-evidently bad, cornball stunts by a guy who worked hard to project ""sense of humor."" In retrospect, the worst are his glib scene dissections like ""Underground"" and ""Battle of Who Could Care Less"", because the only thing more insufferable than scene politics is the outsider who thinks he's above it all. He has sung in character often, most heavily on 1999's <i>The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner</i>-- which was, in retrospect, a practice solo album. On the new songs, he still favors the perspectives of ne'er-do-wells, slobs, misfits, and outcasts, not because he identifies with them but because they make better punchlines.</p>
<p>That kind of condescension can be poisonous, but at least it's something-- a gleam of personality, something to hold on to. <i>The Sound of the Life of the Mind </i>carries no such glimmer, no illuminating spark or animating theme. It's a reunion as obligatory and joyless as that damn <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEyrfFwf3rI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fraggle Rock"" video</a>, and Folds' pop chops sound diminished. On piano he sounds fine, although now as ever he doesn't rock out on keys so much as he approximates rocking out. He doesn't sound especially engaged here, with a bit of hesitance in his voice and very little pleasure in putting across his outré pop obsessions, although that might be because everyone from fun. to Ariel Pink is beating him at this particular game. There are the prerequisite saccharine strings and some self-consciously elegant melodies, but even on the go-get-'em-tiger anthem ""Do It Anyway"", Folds himself doesn't sound especially convinced when he practically yells, ""Read me off a list of the things that I used to not like but now I think are okay."" As rallying cries go, it doesn't exactly trip off the tongue.</p>
<p>""Do It Anyway"" is one of several songs that sound like Folds is chasing those sweet ""Glee"" dollars, although in his defense he's not riding that show's coattails so much as taking his rightful place as principal of William McKinley High School. The title track is his ""Fame"" rewrite: While all the other kids are out mixing ""cherry cola and Scotch,"" a girl stays at school and studies: ""It's noisy out there, it rocks like a mother,"" he sings, and it might be poignant if Folds didn't sound like he'd rather be out cutting it up with the heshers. By the time he gets to the whiny closing track ""Thank You For Breaking My Heart"", you might wish you were, too. Folds has always been a divisive figure-- and not only because he put piano out front. Whether he's lambasting a scene he'd never deign to join or blowing off a girlfriend with a careless ""well, fuck you, too!"" his cleverness can be confrontational, which should provide a sharp contrast to his melodicism. Even as Sledge and Jessee work to add some rough edges to the music, their frontman keeps his distance on <i>Sound of the Life of the Mind</i>, as though he can't quite get outside his own mind. As a result, the album sounds barely able to polarize, like Folds is rockin' the suburbs gently to sleep.</p></div>"|17058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17058-the-sound-of-the-life-of-the-mind/|3.5|Stephen M.

After Newcastle-upon-Tyne's most famous export, Venom, christened the genre and helped to inspire a horde of Scandinavian innovators, England's contributions to the black arts were few and far between. In the mid-1990s, Cradle of Filth's first few albums were a rare spark that illuminated the fog for a few years, but Dani Filth and company dimmed into sub-mediocrity. The blackened grind duo Anaal Nathrakh and experimental armor-clad group the Meads of Asphodel have been continuing bright spots and the progressive crew Akercocke were solid enough, but only in more recent years has metal's spiritual homeland given rise to a new crop of interesting, engaging, and innovative bands that have taken black metal by the horns and twisted until it suited them.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/winterfylleth"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Winterfylleth</a>'s first album was released on Profound Lore back in 2008, the same year that saw fellow UK acts Caïna, Wodensthrone, Fen, Oakenshield, and A Forest of Stars release either demos, debuts, or acclaimed albums. Four years down the line, what was once viewed as an anomaly is now the norm. British black metal is healthier than ever, bolstered by the efforts of the aforementioned bands as well as upstarts like White Medal, Axnaar, Vanyar, Axis of Light, and Wóddréa Mylenstede, and Winterfylleth have emerged as one of its most promising exports. Their pagan roots tie them to bands like Forefather, Symbel, and Old Corpse Road, who have also embraced their nation's history (Forefather dub themselves ""Ango-Saxon Metal"") and, looking even further back, Skyclad and Bal-Sagoth, two of the first British bands to meld traditional folk elements into otherwise brutal music. Their proudly self-described ""English Heritage Black Metal"" has grown and matured since that first record and its successor, 2010's <i>The Mercian Sphere</i>, and their third full-length sees them back in fighting shape.</p>
<p>Winterfylleth's take on black metal is as cold as any Norwegian son's, but they remain unafraid to incorporate both heathen accents and condensed post-rock melodies and run it all through a decidedly English filter. <i>The Threnody of Triumph</i> blows in with the icy ""A Thousand Winters"", blasting straight into a flurry of fairly straightforward black metal that slips into a clean, glistening melody halfway through. The gentle, yearning folk of interlude ""Æfterield-Fréon"" is heartbreaking in its sparse, simple beauty, and leads into the scathing, up-tempo ""A Memorial"". Both ""The Swart Raven"" and ""The Glorious Plain"" juxtapose bleak, biting tremolo with sections of a rousing, chanted chorus stretched across an acoustic skeleton, one of Winterfylleth's favorite (and most pompous) devices. It works here, though, and its various appearances over the course of the record are more charming than eyeroll-inducing. Dark romanticism permeates the album's lyrics and atmosphere, and the ever-present blastbeats rumbling in the depths provide a solid anchor for the more fanciful moments.</p>
<p>""The Fate of Souls After Death"" is possessed of a solid Burzum-meets-Dissection vibe, only showing its pagan colors near the end with a nimble little riff that serves as a nice precursor to ""Home Is Behind""'s wordless and almost classical-sounding acoustic tune. The title track and album closer aims high, and soars higher. Epic in scale and grandiose in execution, ""The Threnody of Triumph"" sounds less like a lament than a battle cry. The buildup and payoff from 3:20-3:49 alone makes this album worth checking out, to say nothing of the dynamic interplay within the song itself and its lush, mellow closing moments. But the album flows together beautifully, and is not meant to be bitten off in iPod-friendly pieces. It's the rare record that's worth an unbroken hour of your time: Winterfylleth have outdone themselves once again, writing a collection as epic as the sweep of history and memories of grand old Albion that inspire their songs.</p></div>"|17149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17149-the-threnody-of-triumph/|7.9|Kim Kelly

The difference is that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"" target=""_blank"">Japandroids'</a> intentions matched their achievements-- <i>Celebration Rock</i> was a winning testament to good times and good rock music at its most life-affirming. <i>Mirage Rock</i>, on the other hand, evokes an emptiness that couldn't have been intentional. Like an actual mirage, there is no <i>there</i> there on <i>Mirage Rock</i>. All the elements for a typical Band of Horses album appear in their right places-- Ben Bridwell's honeyed whine, the straightforward thrust of the guitars, the earnest hippie-dippiness of the lyrics-- and yet the music dissipates instantly upon impact. <i>Mirage Rock</i> is so lightweight and inconsequential that it really does seem more like an illusion than a record; it's wispy and indiscernible, as if the people who made it had no vision for what it should be.</p>
<p>Band of Horses themselves have become something of an apparition-- what they appear to be aren't what they really are. With 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10757-cease-to-begin/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cease to Begin</i></a>, Bridwell unveiled a version of Band of Horses that was not the Band of Horses of the group's beloved 2006 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1200-everything-all-the-time/"" target=""_blank""><i>Everything All the Time</i></a>. The original members-- including Mat Brooke, who had been a bandmate of Bridwell's since their days together in the Seattle indie rock band Carissa's Wierd-- had quietly departed. By 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14243-infinite-arms/"" target=""_blank""><i>Infinite Arms</i></a>, which found the band signing to Columbia, Bridwell had shed another member and added two more. Frontmen retaining a group identities despite losing their backing musicians is nothing new, of course, and Bridwell made sure to publicly declare <i>Infinite Arms</i> a very different beast from the first two BoH records. But if you cared about this group at all, it was difficult to hear that album and not try to pick out the things that made Band of Horses what it used to be, even if most of those things had been systematically removed by Bridwell and replaced by a flatter, shinier, more overtly southern rock sound.</p>
<p>If <i>Infinite Arms</i> marked a significant turn away from the starry-eyed, backwoods indie rock of the band's early sound, <i>Mirage Rock</i> moves boldly forward into the realm of radio-conscious pop that its predecessor only toyed with-- although ""bold"" may be too strong a word for a record this mellow and inoffensive. The rush of emotions Band of Horses channeled on its first two albums has slowed to an intermittent trickle, collecting into a very shallow and sad-looking puddle of a record containing nothing and reflecting nothing.</p>
<p>Band of Horses was never the hardest riffing band in the world, but it's disheartening to see just how far they've moved away from actual rock music here. Much of the album falls into the mold of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47771-new-band-of-horses-slow-cruel-hands-of-time/"" target=""_blank"">""Slow Cruel Hands of Time""</a>, a hazy folk-pop tune that aspires to the soft-focus comfort of 1970s AM radio staples like Dan Fogelberg and John Denver. And Bridwell has neither the lyrical insight nor the vocal gravitas to go any deeper than its superficial veneer allows.</p>
<p>Going deep was never Bridwell's specialty, even on Band of Horses' good records. But he used to make up for it by pushing his music out as wide as it would go, until it wrapped you up like the warmest of bear hugs. <i>Mirage Rock</i>, in comparison, seems shrunken and cold. Lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47635-video-band-of-horses-knock-knock/"" target=""_blank"">""Knock Knock""</a> is strangely gutted, hinting at an emotional catharsis that never arrives. ""How to Live"" moves along on a snappy start-stop drum beat, but only reaches a peak courtesy of a stinging guitar solo cribbed from Neil Young.</p>
<p>Bridwell's gift for assembling catchy melodies and big, relatable sentiments into neat and clean three-minute packages-- typified by the band's irresistibly heart-tugging breakout song ""The Funeral""-- is obvious and not without merit. But over and over again on <i>Mirage Rock</i>, this talent is used to serve up Americana-flavored junk food devoid of substance. The back-porch shuffler ""Long Vows"" and the annoyingly repetitive ""Shut-In Tourist"" are essentially placeholders for better classic-rock songs by Bread and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, lazily flashing soft-rock signifiers without adding any depth of their own.</p>
<p>But it's the terrible protest song ""Dumpster World"" that truly exposes Bridwell as a well-meaning but hapless dude who's lost his course. ""Break out everybody in the jails/ Let's get it on,"" he sings, like a callow bro confusing Bane for Noam Chomsky. The line elicits a moment of embarrassment so shudderingly profound, it makes one question any allegiance to the band’s past successes. Disastrously, <i>Mirage Rock</i> seems to have been conceived, consciously or not, as a photo negative of what this band once was, emphasizing Bridwell's weaknesses and negating his strengths. It's not a pretty picture, to say the least. Perhaps it's best to just squint your eyes and hope it disappears altogether.</p></div>"|17042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17042-mirage-rock/|4.0|Steven Hyden

His highest-profile production gig, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28603-gonjasufi/"" target=""_blank"">Gonjasufi</a>'s 2010 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13968-a-sufi-and-a-killer/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Sufi and a Killer</i></a>, was psychotropic hip-hop at its most elemental, stuff so gristly and eye-peeling-- and occasionally beautiful-- that it reset the parameters for what you could nod your head to (assuming you could still remember where it was located). Pick up that same year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14768-death-gate-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Death Gate</i></a> EP or jump back a year to his 2009 EP, <i>My Troubled Mind</i>, and you can hear that sound emerge from a mindstate reared on 1980s VHS horror, hippy-biker exploitation soundtracks and car-trunk g-funk, stuff that expanded on the Left Coast underground influence of '96-era Shadow and Automator into a red-lit grindhouse. And it becomes even clearer soaking on a mix like 2009's <i>Hell and the Lake of Fire are Waiting for You!</i>, one of the best documents of his persistent efforts as a DJ to turn clubland crate-digger culture into an altered-state travelogue worthy of his Low End Theory bonafides. Flipping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1225-dungen/"" target=""_blank"">Dungen</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"" target=""_blank"">Can</a>, and space-age 70s European production library music in the same set as Smif N Wessun and Organized Konfusion is exactly the kind of approach that makes running in the same crowed as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29245-teebs/"" target=""_blank"">Teebs</a> sound like a natural destination in context.</p>
<p><i>Breakthrough</i> is a record that fits Gaslamp Killer well as a rundown of everything he's been able to imprint on his career so far. It's a run of occasionally disorienting, sometimes frantic, usually unnerving trips into distinct corners of psychedelic and experimental influence that spark briefly to reveal vivid life and fade out just as quickly. And it succeeds, driven as it is by up-front, iron-fisted live drumming that's mixed up into the red. He builds around that neck-snap percussion in ways that dredge up an air of constant tension, ebbing and flowing through so many different forms so quickly that it creates this air of unknowable dread; once it seems like there might be a consistent method to it, it switches focus to some other angle. Pick a style, and he'll coax out the most nerve-twisting elements of its abrasive side-- synthesized dirges that snap a wire and start sparking off into something noisier (""Meat Guilt""); Morricone panic attacks that sound purpose-built to soundtrack a splattery low-budget drive-in movie death (""Critic""); organ-driven garage funk given a stoner-metal lurch (""Dead Vets"").</p>
<p>But calling <i>Breakthrough</i> the most direct line into Gaslamp Killer's singularly unhinged vision would be a bit misleading: As befitting an artist who's as important for who he's hung out with and given opportunities to as he is for what he's done on his own, this is a record that leads him to filter his ideas through a number of like-minded collaborators. Sometimes it's just a matter of finding the right piece to plug in: Miguel Atwood-Ferguson's keening strings pierce through the wall of synth-hesher fuzz on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13864-flange-face-ft-miguel-atwood-ferguson/"" target=""_blank"">""Flange Face""</a>, Gonjasufi is his usual otherworldly presence on the spiritual admonishment of ""Veins"" and the outreach of ""Apparitions"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/989-daedelus/"" target=""_blank"">Daedelus</a> incorporates touches of 8-bit vertigo into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14161-the-impulse-ft-daedelus/"" target=""_blank"">""Impulse""</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30105-shigeto/"" target=""_blank"">Shigeto</a> helps steer the percussive rattle of ""Keep it Simple Stupid"" through an analog squall that makes the title's advice sound a bit beside the point. And sometimes it's the collaborative aspect that actually drives the song itself-- Gaslamp Killer's heritage-driven enthusiasm for Turkish music, previously heard in tracks like <i>My Troubled Mind</i> cut ""Turk Mex"", is fleshed out with live instrumentation supplied by Amir Yaghmai on ""Nissim"".</p>
<p>So GLK's found a communal niche, all right, but how far deep has he worked himself in there? Because <i>Breakthrough</i>-- which it is and isn't-- feels like the kind of record his adventurous precedent has made into a familiar signature. It's the album that gets at his recent creative mode most definitively, the one people might figure he had in him rather than the one that changed anybody's minds about him. Which is good news, really-- expecting a dose of high-quality doom-struck instrumental hip-hop and getting it is the kind of thing only jaded fad-hoppers get disappointed over. The idea that it might draw more fans to his stylistic strengths means the potential for a subsequent breakthrough of <i>Cosmogramma</i> advancement can wait a bit. This one offers plenty to wrap your head around in the meantime.</p></div>"|17038.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17038-breakthrough/|7.7|Nate Patrin

He will run up in foreclosed houses in North Minneapolis with a crew of neighborhood poverty-fighting activists and end up in the back of a squad car for it. He'll antagonize his tour sponsors when they get cold feet about his lyrics, like in 2007 when Verizon cut off their endorsement in the wake of ""Uncle Sam Goddamn"". And when given the opportunity to hide behind somebody else's ""post-racial"" melting-pot narrative that portrays him as some kind of cultural outsider (""the blind albino Muslim rapper!""), he publicly owns up to his place of white privilege, keeping full recognition of the advantages he was given even as he holds pride in adhering to the tenets of what's still treated in America as a minority faith. He has all the work ethic and self-respect of someone who doesn't worry about what other people think, and all the community awareness and sense of justice of someone who can't picture anything more important than what other people think.</p>
<p>As much as he's solidified his place in the indie rap game, Ali always seems like he's in the process of working out new things-- how to best balance out his roles as an artist and an activist, how to reflect on his past and learn from his mistakes and conflicts, and how to translate each new phase of his life and his experiences into work that maintains the precarious balance between being imposing and being humble. <i>Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color</i> is where the political agitation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10087-the-undisputed-truth/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Undisputed Truth</i></a> and the social humanism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13475-us/"" target=""_blank""><i>Us</i></a> intersect, and there's no vague platitudes or defeatist cynicism here. Ali is a man with a purpose and zero interest in holding back, someone so attuned to what it takes to move a crowd with his voice that he trusts in its power to let some complication and nuance support all the confrontational honesty.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing, because when <i>Mourning in America</i> gets political, at least in the early goings, there's not much in it to make well-meaning liberals feel better about themselves. The America that frustrates Ali is one that still has something to pull for, as he puts it in the Cornel West-featuring leadoff track ""Letter to My Countrymen"". With the idea that it's hard to want to better a country you're too defeated to see the good in, he sees hope in the potential of its citizenry from the ground up-- ""It's home, so we better make the best of it/ I wanna make this country what it says it is"". That it isn't what it says it is gets broken down severely in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14051-mourning-in-america/"" target=""_blank"">""Mourning in America""</a>, taking off from the familiar rhetorical device of contrasting first-world militarization and guerilla insurgency-- ""terrorism is the war of the poor"" and ""warfare's the terrorism of the rich""-- to also get down to the essence of how that mindset doesn't even need another country's involvement, and how it eats America at the core with shoot-first police and for-profit prisons. And just as he stands looking at American society as someone who's in a position to benefit from its injustice but doesn't want to, he does the same with pop music for ""Won More Hit"", breaking down the music industry's entrenched exploitation of black artists and tearing at it from the inside. These are the words of someone who wants himself and his country to be exceptional and powerful and successful without somebody else needing to suffer to make that happen-- any other victory would be pyrrhic.</p>
<p>Of course, there's that something in Ali's voice that makes being preached to feel rousing instead of tedious. He builds verses that, while rich with wordplay, never let cleverness get in the way of clarity. Not that he doesn't get clever-- the bait-and-switch jokes of ""Need a Knot"" are a bit corny but sly nonetheless, even when the clean-cut punchlines to the narratives about how he used to ""move white"" or ""chop green"" play their hands. And there's always the notion he practices-- that making every word and sentiment crystal clear not only gets the message across but the raspy yet booming impact of his flow too. So when he uses that voice and that lyrical bluntness to lay his personal life bare, it puts a resounding weight behind it, one that feels honest to a fault. Detailing how he had to cope with a grueling, crew-fracturing tour itinerary upended by his father's suicide and the death of close friend/fellow Minneapolis rap mainstay Michael ""Eyedea"" Larsen in ""Stop the Press"" turns what could have been straightforward autobio into a clash between vulnerability and willpower. And ""All You Need"", where he has to address his neglectful ex-wife and tell his son why his mother isn't around anymore, does a grown-man job of placing the blame where it stands but makes sure to keep empathy in the picture: ""I know you wonder why your mother does the things that she do/ Well, it's not 'cause she doesn't love you/ It's because she grew up in something they call 'foster care'...""</p>
<p><i>Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color</i> is more of a refinement than a deviation for Brother Ali, even though there's one prominent change that could set off questions-- the departure of longtime producer ANT, who was unavailable while on tour with Atmosphere. Taking his place for full production duties is Seattle's Jake One, who maintains the Rhymesayers family connection and should have all the cred he needs solely on the back of <i>White Van Music</i> collaboration ""The Truth"". That precedent's met well on this slate of beats-- not too distant from the vibrant soul of <i>Us</i>, but a bit more upfront and varied, versatile conceptually (the pseudo-trap of ""Need a Knot"") and characteristically (the seething heavy funk of obligatory step-to-this-mic-and-get-fucked-up cut ""Say Amen""). And Ali adjusts his flow and cadence accordingly-- he flips more variations on his delivery than any of his previous releases, and any illusions that he's one-dimensional in any respect are finally and fully eliminated on this album. That doesn't just go for his voice or his lyrics or his subject matter; it feels true to the man himself. If that means working out how much of his politics are personal and vice-versa, so be it. He contains multitudes.</p></div>"|16941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16941-brother-ali-mourning-in-america-and-dreaming-in-color/|7.9|Nate Patrin

Yet this tenuous link becomes an exception that proves the rule. While Corgan is still airing out grudges and resentments against any and all bands that ticked him off and fans who had the gall to stop buying his records after <i>Adore</i>, Iha is calmly going about the business of releasing what sounds like a logical follow-up to <i>Let It Come Down</i>, his solo record which celebrated its 14th birthday this year<i>. </i>This clearly has the potential to work out better for Iha. Bands who sound and sell like Smashing Pumpkins don't exist anymore, and the leveling of the playing field has allowed artists to become stars even while making the sort of modest music Iha favored on <i>Let It Come Down</i>: peaceful, easy California folk-rock, dewy AM-radio pop. From the sounds of <i>Look to the Sky</i>, Iha <i>does</i> want to be a star. Unfortunately it's on 1998's terms, and he's prepared with bafflingly outdated alt-rock songs that could comfortably sidle between choice cuts from Marcy Playground and Semisonic<i> </i>and get their asses handed to them.</p>
<p>It didn't have to end up like this. Iha's built up a lot of goodwill over the years simply by not being Billy Corgan, and if you're amenable to the sort of  KROQ-friendly alt he abetted in A Perfect Circle and attempted as part of Tinted Windows, there are moments that can press your Buzz Bin joy buzzer. Check the whooshing raygun effects from ""Speed of Love"", the meek and unexpected female harmonies on ""Make Believe"", and you'll be able to overlook his rhyming, ""You rush in with stars in your hair/ You cast your spell and float through the air,"" in the first damn line. Plus, you hear those chiming, flanged arpeggios on ""To Who Knows Where"" and it starts triggering memories of songs like ""Believe"" and ""The Boy"", very strong Iha B-sides that admittedly wouldn't have fit anywhere on <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness </i>like the comparatively limp ""Farewell &amp; Goodnight"" or ""Take Me Down"" did. Besides, there <i>is </i>precedent for this kind of thing being done quite well and quite recently. After all, wasn't the Pains of Being Pure at Heart's Flood-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15270-belong""><i>Belong </i></a>a document of alternate history where Iha took the controls of the Pumpkins ca. <i>Mellon Collie </i>for about 40 minutes? It's almost frightening how close some of <i>Look to the Sky </i>resembles <i>Belong</i>, though Iha mostly favors the mid-tempo, big-chorus stuff (i.e., ""The Body"", ""Even in Dreams"") and the album's one very unfortunate genre experiment (""Appetite"") is the sort of baritone burlesque piano maundering Scott Weiland attempted at his most far-gone on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verbFuGymN8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lady, Your Roof Brings Me Down""</a>. Weiland's was <i>much</i> better.</p>
<p>You can engage in this sort of cautiously optimistic evaluation process for about 10 minutes, after which the music of <i>Look to the Sky </i>just does not matter. I'd feel more comfortable telling you Iha has nothing to say here.<i> </i>The problem is that he <i>does</i>, and it's mostly just sad to see the cruel strictures of rhyme scheme cause someone to sing things he would almost certainly never think or speak. It might sound strange to bring up Iha's lyrics as unacceptable considering that, with all due respect, the bar's not really all that high in this field. Some might just go ahead and say that ""I'm traveling at the speed of love/ And sooner and later I'll be crashing"" is not a lyric that should emerge from the mouth of a grown-ass man. I'll give Iha the benefit of the doubt and say ""twee"" doesn't <i>really </i>have an age limit, though the frequency of song titles like ""Summer Days"", ""New Years Day"", ""Make Believe"", and oh yes, ""Speed of Love"" tests patience merely by appearing on one's iPod.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">My bigger issue is that those aren't the kind of lyrics that should be coming from a guy who clearly knows how to put a song together and might've been sitting on these ones for the better part of a decade and a half. When Pains' Kip Berman sings an iffy lyric like ""Tell me again what the body's for/ 'Cause I can't feel it any more"" on ""The Body"", the sentiment and emotional content is understandable even if you might want to phrase it differently. I can't even really give Iha's lyrics the dignity of cliché because clichés are truth for the most part. Most of this stuff has a strange aggression in its refusal to even bother making any sense. Here's the intro triplet on ""Waves"": ""Waves wash over me/ Drag me out to sea/ A tide pours slow-ow-ly,"" but wait... how are the waves washing over him if he's not <i>already </i>out to sea? Iha has no time for your follow-up questions, pressing in a maudlin deeper register: ""Tonight I feel so alone/ Tonight I've wandered far from home."" Got that? And, for God's sake, does he really rhyme the title of ""Till Next Tuesday"" with ""close the door till it's <i>news-day</i>?"" Even with that bashful voice of his, the words become impossible to ignore and these aren't songs so much as a kind of mental tennis game where Iha serves and you put yourself in position to volley with a guess at the most obvious and often correct rhyme. ""Gemini"" becomes a highlight by default as it's about the only song here that doesn't adhere to a strict AA/BB pattern.</p>
<p>The content is disheartening enough, but it's the context of <i>Look to the Sky </i>that makes it pitiable. Maybe slap some preset beats on it and trade out some of the guitars for synths of Gushers-like sickly sweetness, attribute it to a post-Owl City new jack rather than a well-known guitarist from a 90s alt-rock titan, and you might have something that all of a sudden shows up in Billboard's Top 20 without your having any idea where the fuck they came from. But in the aforementioned leveled playing field, Iha gets exposed-- <i>Look to the Sky</i> expresses so little that could be considered real or truthful that it couldn't have been created out of some sort of emotional necessity and is aiming for radio formats that no longer exist.

Songwriter Mike Donovan and drummer Matt Hartman sought an improbable union of pop sweetness and sonic hate, blasting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2304-the-kinks/"" target=""_blank"">Kinks</a> riffs through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9569-pussy-galore/"" target=""_blank"">Pussy Galore</a>'s shredded speaker cabinets.</p>
<p>But if you're the type who comes to Sic Alps looking to get your hair blown back, the opening notes of the group's self-titled fourth album (fifth, if you count the compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11976-a-long-way-around-to-a-shortcut/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Long Way Round to a Shortcut</i></a>) will be a bit discombobulating. The record begins not with the death rattle of a battered thrift-store amplifier, but the harmonious tones of a hired string section. It's a soft but sinister set of songs-- the Bay Area's answer to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a>'s self-titled record. Where Sic Alps were once wasted and wobbly, they are now stoned and serene.</p>
<p>However messy the old Sic Alps sounded, they worked hard on it. Donovan would track his vocals and guitar alone in a single take, after which Hartman would step in to help graft on scuzz and grunge one 8-track layer at a time until things sounded right (or wrong in the right way). <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14995-napa-asylum/"" target=""_blank""><i>Napa Asylum</i></a>, the group's third LP, was a culmination of this approach-- a grand <i>Zen Arcade</i>-style throw-it-all-in-the-pile double album that pinballed between zonked-babbling, free-form noise collages, and a few worthy garage-rock nuggets. In terms of sheer sprawling weirdness, it would have been hard to top.</p>
<p>Sic Alps did try, though. Shortly after that record's release, the band booked some time with San Francisco studio mainstay Eric Bauer to record some follow-up material. But in the spring of 2011, Hartman abruptly parted ways with the band. Those songs-- versions of which saw release throughout the following year on a series of 7"" singles-- had a little bit of extra breathing room, but kept the fuzz cranked. By the time Sic Alps went to record another full length, they had the grit out of their system.</p>
<p><i>Sic Alps</i>, also recorded with Bauer, isn't the band's first encounter with a professional studio, but it's certainly the most professional-sounding set of songs that they've ever assembled in one. For the first time ever, it sounds like the rhythm section was recorded in the same room at the same time. Where Donovan once came off like the Mission's most sinister hippy, on <i>Sic Alps</i> he's affected a more amiable persona: the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2655-stephen-malkmus/"" target=""_blank"">Malkmus</a>-style gentleman slacker. After wafting in on a cloud of drone and hiss, ""Polka Vat"" congeals into a relaxed-fit groove worthy of <i>Wowee Zowee</i>­-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a>. ""Moviehead"" perfectly pairs a twanging Creedence-style riff with lyrics that drop references to ""shred-dogs"" and bengaline silk. There's still a little bit of scuzz, but it's been pushed to the background, leaving Donovan alone in center frame. But as a lyricist, he's at his best on Sic Alps, sinking bizzaro couplets left and right. On ""Rock Races"", he sounds, for the first time ever, optimistic. ""Let's knock every wall down for love,"" he sings. And when Donovan's words trail off into lazy la-la-las, the string section picks up the slack. Sic Alps rarely reach for a grand gesture, but here they skirt into sublimely cinematic territory.</p>
<p>The pro studio production hasn't reduced the essential strangeness of Sic Alps' music, though. Rather, the transition from lo-fi auteur to visionary singer-songwriter is Drag City's standby narrative-- the path that produced some of the label's most resonant artists, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"" target=""_blank"">Will Oldham</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Callahan</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6642-david-berman/"" target=""_blank"">David Berman</a>.

They range from former greats like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"">Pusha-T</a> to half-decent punchline rappers like <a href=""%20http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a> to entourage bottom-feeders like CyHi the Prince, and spending a long time in their presence can feel like being trapped in a reality-TV house. Kanye drops by occasionally, but he mostly feels a million miles away. Kanye's career has been built on maniacal quality control, but <i>Cruel Summer</i> feels uncharacteristically disposable. </p>
<p>Even the title is botched. The album arrives on September 18, with school in session and the season's cruelest days far behind us. This day late/dollar short feeling persists throughout. The production is often cluttered with unnecessary effects, like the vocal ""whoa-oh-oh"" synth pads West threw on his remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Chief Keef</a>'s ""I Don't Like"" when he couldn't figure out how to improve it. Songs take ill-advised turns. After verses from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"">Raekwon</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/"">Common</a>, Pusha T, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"">2 Chainz</a>, and CyHi the Prince are hurled at you like a handful of action figures on ""The Morning"", the song inexplicably changes key so that Nigerian singer D'Banj can warble in Auto-Tune. ""Sin City"" starts out with a generic dubstep low-end before transitioning into a mortifying slam-poetry performance by Malik Yusef. And then when that's over, who should come along next but... CyHi the Prince. Again.</p>
<p>If Kanye had resisted the temptation to stuff <i>Cruel Summer</i> with his LucasArts production magic, it might have worked as a pure bid for rap radio's dead center. With ""Niggas in Paris"", West got closer to that center than he'd been in a while; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/""><i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i></a>, for all its accolades, struggled to find its foothold on the pop charts. There are a handful of hits here, and they range from the pretty good to the fantastic. You've probably heard them all by now, and they will outlive this comp; they are are the reason the record deserves to exist.</p>
<p><i>Cruel Summer</i>'s secret MVP is Hit-Boy, the producer who brought Kanye the ""Paris"" beat; he shows up on with ""Cold"" (formerly known as ""Theraflu""), a sleekly coursing West solo track in which he hashes out the increasingly silly details of his life -- his jealousy towards Kim Kardashian's 72-day husband Kris Humphries; his adventures go-karting with Polish models -- with his trademark aggrieved sense of urgency. Hit-Boy also offers up ""Clique"", a transfixing, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a>-like collection of hiccups and synth strobes. ""Clique"" is haughty, spotless, and coldly perfect; it sounds like bottle service. West takes the opportunity to sneer at former CIA director George Tenet's car.</p>
<p>Apart from Hit-Boy's contributions, there are three tracks from Hudson Mohawke, the rising Glasgow producer whose compellingly fractured beats have caught the ear of hip-hop figures like Just Blaze. His contributions -- ""To the World"", ""The One"", and ""Bliss"", which makes use of 2009's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6db6SIlSP2g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ice Viper""</a>-- don't sound like anything off of his riotous <i>Satin Panthers</i> EP, but they are welcome signs that Mohawke is moving into high-profile hip-hop territory. ""To the World"", a track featuring R. Kelly that's built off a slightly stiff drumline beat and swarms of string plucks, benefits from an animated turn from Kanye, who mangles Francis Ford Coppola's name hilariously and taunts Mitt Romney in a nagging singsong for failing to disclose his taxes.</p>
<p>But once the early run of singles are out of the way, things start to go south. By the time you get to Kid CuDi's dribbly alt-rock solo turn ""Creepers"" (actual lyric: ""If I had one wish, it'd be to have more wishes/ Duh... Fuck trying to make it rhyme"") it seems like even the artists involved have left the room. Pusha-T huffs and snorts a lot, but drops lines like ""wherever we go, we do it pronto."" You'd never guess from his performance here that he was once a member of Clipse. Big Sean, who's shown flickering signs of wanting to actually rap lately, sits back and offers terrible puns on the word ""ass."" R&amp;B singer Teyana Taylor comes nowhere near her work on <i>Twisted Fantasy</i>. </p>
<p>It's the sense of Event, which has become as much of an art for Kanye as his music over the years, that is most blatantly missing here. The only people who seem to recognize what's at stake are the old-timers. Ma$e, of all people, shows up out of nowhere on ""Higher"" to lick shots at his former Bad Boy rival Loon: No one cares, but he still sounds slick. And then there's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"">Ghostface</a>, who roars to life at the end of ""New God Flow"", a track based off his own ""Mighty Healthy"" from 2000's classic <i>Supreme Clientele</i>. Ghost's appearance is an obvious prestige-casting move, but still a perfect one, and he makes the most of it, reliving his Pretty Toney days one more time. A handful of guests aside, though, none of G.O.O.D. Music's personalities do much to justify their newfound prominence. If <i>Cruel Summer</i> is meant to be an argument for the label's other talent, it makes a weak case.</p></div>"|16994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16994-cruel-summer/|6.5|Jayson Greene

The group's reference points remain the same: 1960s sunshine pop, the Grateful Dead's improvisational explorations, and 90s lo-fi. The most immediately distinctive attribute of Woods' music-- and its most decisive point of demarcation-- is singer Jeremy Earl's childlike falsetto; if you can't appreciate Earl's voice, Woods' rapidly growing discography (which is also rounded out by various EPs and singles) will be a non-starter. Otherwise, that body of work is among the most consistently enjoyable from any young indie rock band in the past several years, and <i>Bend Beyond </i>is Woods' most approachable gateway yet.</p>
<p>As for the minor refinements made on <i>Bend Beyond</i>, they aren't all that minor at all, actually-- the songwriting is more disciplined, and the production offers more clarity and variety than ever before. While 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15499-sun-and-shade/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sun and Shade</i></a> exhibited Woods' jammy side amid the usual folk-pop gems, <i>Bend Beyond </i>is all pop, all the time, with only one song running past the four-minute mark, and only by 25 seconds. That song happens to be the foreboding title track, already one of the all-time great Woods tracks and an in-concert highlight that runs two or three times longer live than on record. But even in truncated form, ""Bend Beyond"" is a thrilling example of Woods' ability (in spite of living thousands of miles away on the opposite coast) to conjure the spirits of L.A. folk rock and the dark vibes emanating from the scene's seamy underbelly. If ""Bend Beyond"" is the album's best song, ""Is It Honest?"" sounds like the record's surest hit, opening with a shimmering electric-guitar riff that might be the single catchiest moment on any Woods album. (Though it's rivaled by the harmonica blowing like a train whistle through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13826-cali-in-a-cup/"" target=""_blank"">""Cali in a Cup""</a>.) But darkness lingers in ""Is It Honest?"", too-- ""It's so fucking hard to see,"" Earl spits in the chorus, an uncommonly aggressive moment in this group's otherwise peaceful, pastoral universe.</p>
<p>Whatever battles are being waged in the lyrics against demons real and imagined don't carry over to the music, which is effervescent and sweetly touching and unmistakably presented with well-earned confidence and new-found polish. On past records, Woods might have obscured the delicate campfire ballad ""It Ain't Easy"" in layers of tape hiss. (Tape manipulator G. Lucas Crane is mostly absent throughout <i>Bend Beyond.</i>) But here it shines in crystal-clear fidelity, and the stunning melody earns such treatment, carried on sparkling acoustic guitar and Earl's tender, heart-tugging vocal.</p>
<p>In an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8875-woods/"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with Pitchfork earlier this year, Earl said the idea on <i>Bend Beyond</i> was to spend a little more time on the songs than usual, as opposed to the extemporaneous approach of past releases: ""That was always our style: embrace the spontaneous energy of recording a song the minute after it's written, do the overdubs really fast, mix while recording. For this album, we decided to re-record stuff more."" You can hear that extra care in the fantastically menacing organ riff on ""Find Them Empty"" and the chiming guitar riff that lifts the chorus of the charming ""Impossible Sky"". For the first time, Woods have given their own songs their full due on record.</p>
<p>Fans of Woods' ""spontaneous energy"" might lament the relative straight-forwardness of <i>Bend Beyond</i> (even if the band's recent self-titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16501-woods-amps-for-christ/"" target=""_blank"">split release</a> with Amps For Christ suggests they haven't entirely left that approach behind). But Woods' greatest strength has always been songwriting, and sharpening the focus and cleaning up the production has only enhanced the band's welcoming melodies. Besides, it's about time this chronically undervalued group broadened its audience a bit. After <i>Bend Beyond</i>, there are plenty of other great Woods records that await neophytes.</p></div>"|17047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17047-bend-beyond/|8.1|Steven Hyden

When they play together, John McEntire, Sam Prekop, Archer Prewitt, and Eric Claridge occupy an indie rock niche all their own, and their utter consistency at turning out well-wrought, prettily cerebral records might help explain why they've never met a hype cycle that paid them any mind in spite of the quality of their music. Trends come and go, but the Sea and Cake are more or less constant, and have been for almost 20 years. Even when what they do comes into vogue, as it has a few times, they seem to be left out of the think pieces because they're not new.</p>
<p>Dispositionally, their music sits in an open-air bar on a beach in St. Kitts, but sonically, it sits on a beach between Lake Shore Drive and Lake Michigan, with an occasional chill in the breeze blowing off the water. Sam Prekop's voice is a breathy wisp that champions tone over diction, and as such it fits in with the self-effacing playing of his bandmates. Listening to the gorgeously captured sounds on <i>Runner</i>, the band's 10th LP (counting last year's relatively concise <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15404-the-moonlight-butterfly/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Moonlight Butterfly</i></a>), it's clear that these are highly accomplished musicians, but there's not a single moment where all that prodigious technique isn't kept on a tight leash. Prewitt might unleash a ragged and fiery lead on ""Skyscrapers"" after the first verse, but McEntire's neat and orderly production keeps it from raising the temperature of the song too much.</p>
<p>For a lot of bands, that kind of imposed restraint might be suffocating-- oddly, it helps this group's music breathe. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13943-harps/"" target=""_blank"">""Harps""</a> is practically all breath, a song so light it feels as if the slightest gust could snatch it away-- Prewitt's e-bowed guitar part gives it a sort of Berlin-period Bowie vibe, and McEntire's crisp drums are its only ballast. It's easy to just let the album play and fill the room while you do something else, but a close listen reveals a lot of thought and care in the way these songs are constructed. One of the most startling left turns on the album comes when ""The Invitations"" transitions unexpectedly from a normal, breathy Sea and Cake song into a sort of beachy, droney disco track halfway through.</p>
<p><i>Runner</i> shakes out as one of this band's most subtly varied albums, and it can be an immersive listening experience if you give yourself over to it. Outside of ""Harps"" and the energetic opener, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14044-on-and-on/"" target=""_blank"">""On and On""</a>, the songs work more on a textural and sensory level than as melodically memorable set pieces, but this does nothing to diminish their beauty or the craft evident in their construction, nor the fact that this is the kind of music that can wrap you up easily in something as simple as a compelling chord sequence, as it does on the title track. The Sea and Cake may never be the thing that everyone is talking about, but here, they're as reliable as ever, and that has its own kind of value.</p></div>"|17055.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17055-runner/|7.2|Joe Tangari

With <i>Illmatic</i> as a guiding light, and 2xCDs generally regarded as little more than a stunt to double soundscan counts or overreach artistically, critics lamented the lack of editing and conceptual cohesion of many of the most interesting albums of hip-hop's commercial golden age. Gunplay's latest mixtape, <i>601 &amp; Snort-- </i>presumably retitled from <i>106 &amp; Snort</i> due to potential legal similarities to the BET television program-- is proof that this isn't always an ideal. There's nothing on <i>601 &amp; Snort</i> to complain about, but it feels like a shadow of a great record, a stopgap whose place in history will largely be determined by what happens next in Gunplay's career.</p>
<p>Gunplay is, unquestionably, one of the most vibrant and entertaining personalities in hip-hop, a throwback to a time when skilled, animated rappers like Busta Rhymes and Redman ruled the airwaves; it's difficult to understand why isn't already in deodorant commercials or stoner movies. (Luckily, he is in hilarious <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSqTXGH93rE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">promotional videos</a> that give an idea of the his star power.) But while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15097-inglorious-bastard-prelude-to-valkyrie/"" target=""_blank"">some</a> were aware of the rapper's considerable strengths prior, it was Gunplay's guest spot on Kendrick Lamar's ""Cartoon &amp; Cereal"" that seemed to push him into the national media spotlight. Where he had previously been a hero to roughneck rap connoisseurs, thanks to his explosive turns on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQIe9E_MZTA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mask On""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqWMfzY6nZk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rollin""</a>, his move to the attention of bloggers and label heads (he was signed to Def Jam earlier this year) has been marked by a stylistic shift. Where last year he ripped across contemporary-sounding Luger tracks, this year he's moved on to freestyling over older 90s production: RZA beats, Pimp C beats, the ""Deep Cover"" instrumental. Luckily, Gunplay always sounds engaging, even when he doesn't sound particularly focused.</p>
<p>When he snaps into a well-written verse, it goes from being a fun tape to transcendent. <i>601 &amp; Snort</i> feels slight because it contains only one true moment like this: ""Bible on the Dash"", a freestyle over a Morris Brothers-produced Shy Glizzy song called ""Southside"". The track finds Gunplay locked in: ""I asked the pastor, 'what's the fastest way to heaven for a bastard with a tarnished past, give me an honest answer?/ With all this Hannah Montana without the Arm &amp; Hammer am I gonna get the slammer or the casket?'""</p>
<p>But the bulk of the tape is less a collection of songs than well-curated beat tape of one-off freestyles, a generic Rick Ross collaboration, and an artist hinting at what more he could accomplish given the right situation and motivation. Maybe Gunplay is one of the few rappers who understands that just spewing out releases, his best tracks mixed amongst sub-par collaborations and half-hearted efforts, isn't an ideal marketing strategy for all artists, and we'll get a diverse, 21-track monster of a Def Jam LP by year-end. In that case, <i>601 &amp; Snort</i> feels like a pretty decent warm-up, a stopgap measure to keep us entertained and anticipating. On the other hand, the considerable delays, non-releases (what happened to <i>Bogota</i>?), and light catalog of full-on 2012 songs worth celebrating aren't positive signs. These records will only maintain buzz for a limited time. A solid project looks pretty vital right now. </p></div>"|17160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17160-601-snort/|6.2|David Drake

""There's no Hooded Menace without horror. It wouldn't be the same,"" multi-instrumentalist and bandleader Lasse Pyykkö said in a 2010 <a href=""http://www.doommantiaforum.com/t239-curse-of-the-eyeless-dead-interview-with-hooded-menace"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, articulating the obvious. ""We all dig horror films from the past and find it a vast source of inspiration.""</p>
<p>On two previous full-lengths and a bevy of splits, such inspiration has served as kindling for Hooded Menace's music, giving their lurch a primal and welcome urgency. But on this year's <i>Effigies of Evil</i>, Pyykkö and Pekka Koskelo's debut for Relapse Records, such aesthetic influence overrides the music itself; that is, these eight tracks often seem more like attempts to convey the pair's gruesome obsessions than to make a memorable metal record. Pyykkö has long talked about how the sinister atmospheres and wretched images and sounds of horror films fit Hooded Menace, but <i>Effigies of Evil</i> often feels like an attempt to fit the band to those qualities, to force these winding doom riffs into unnecessarily unbecoming directions. The result is often more mawkish than scary. ""Summoned Into Euphoric Madness"", for instance, offers the creation myth of a wolfman, or, as Pyykkö roars by way of unmemorable refrain, the ""legend of the lycanthrope."" But his tendency to growl the lyrics and distend the syllables-- you know, like a legitimate wolf-- seems mostly inane, a distraction from the song's otherwise brilliant cascade of riffs and powerful march toward the end. The same holds for ""Curses Scribed in Gore"", a rhythm-and-pitch-bending marathon that rumbles heavily enough for three minutes before settling into an instrumental bridge ostensibly meant to sound creepy. It lands much closer to goofy. And again, so it goes with the corpse-prodding ""Crumbling Insanity"", in which Pyykkö goes for full zombie vocals above a funerary guitar line-- that's after a sample about the rising dead, mind you. If this all sounds more scary than silly, please beware of totally terrifying things like hobgoblins and bugaboos.</p>
<p>Considering that it's creation was so fueled by film, <i>Effigies of Evil</i> feels strangely more episodic than cinematic. Hooded Menace are the kind of act that demands a concept album, with transposable threads spread throughout the record, tying the horror show together for an inescapable hour. They've teamed here again with the lyrical partnership of Tanya Sim and Kevin Campbell (Pyykkö has long been clear about his distaste for writing lyrics); taken by themselves, their stanzas of creatures seeking ""unholy rebirth"" or overlords out for ""torture and mutilation"" are where the horror show actually finds its payload. But Pyykkö's decision to eviscerate the lyrics with the lowest bellow he can manage means they largely only work in the liner notes. The words get little support from the music, either, hidebound as Hooded Menace are to song-length bursts of brutality that flicker and soon disappear. This record feels as much defined by its exits as its overwhelming sense of anything.</p>
<p>In another 2010 <a href=""http://thatshowkidsdie.com/2010/04/28/interview-hooded-menace/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> for <i>That's How Kids Die</i>, Pyykkö was asked whether, given his obsessions and inspirations, he'd ever considered making scores for horror movies. Pyykkö claimed incompetence, saying that, despite being the person who writes Hooded Menace's music and plays everything but drums on each record, he's also a lousy keyboard player. ""It's a pity that I suck at keys,"" he said. ""Horror keyboards would rule and if you really could play piano it damn surely would help."" <i>Effigies of Evil</i> feels very much like Hooded Menace's attempt to subvert the question, to create their own horror shorts within their music rather than using their music to score them. Occasionally, a few riffs sit memorably, and a few shifts in structure are notably unorthodox, even for these Candlemass adherents. But overall, the reach required for that grasp is still beyond their means and methods, turning all their attempts at being dire into a looming cloud of indifference. This time around, perhaps Hoodied Menace would be more apt.</p></div>"|17076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17076-effigies-of-evil/|6.0|Grayson Currin

That was the last lyric left hovering in the mist of Grizzly Bear's breakout 2009 album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13078-veckatimest/"" target=""_blank""><i>Veckatimest</i></a>, and it's a pretty good image to describe what it's like to listen to one of their records. The key word there is ""a,"" signifying one of many. Whether it's the ethereal, friendly-ghost vibes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9365-yellow-house/""><i>Yellow House</i></a> or <i>Veckatimest's</i> pristine chamber pop, Grizzly Bear create music in deep focus; what's going on in the margins of their songs is just as important and expressive as the center. Taking cues from artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"">Talk Talk</a> and <a href=""http://www.vandykeparks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Van Dyke Parks</a>, the Brooklyn four-piece make pop music with an ear for the ambient, asking us to notice the importance in detail, the beauty of texture, and the foregrounds that exist all across our spectrum of perception.</p>
<p>While there's no question that Grizzly Bear's last two records have <i>sounded</i> gorgeous, critics of the band have wondered if that's enough. <i>Shields</i>, the band's fourth and most compositionally adventurous record, should put those concerns to bed. Though full of baroque, detail-rich production and latticework melodies, <i>Shields</i> also offers an emotionally resonant core. The album is an excavation of loneliness, melancholy, and self-reliance. It's also a demanding record, without an instantly gratifying single like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuYZbYtAl9A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Knife</a>"" or ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11250-two-weeks/"">Two Weeks</a>"" to hook restless ears. But the rewards that come from immersing yourself in it are odd and profound. <i>Shields</i> feels like a summation of Grizzly Bear's strengths, drawing a line from the muddy, minor key sonic palette of Ed Droste's home-recorded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3666-horn-of-plenty/""><i>Horn of Plenty</i></a> and stringing it to the heels of boundless ambition.</p>
<p><i>Shields</i>' spectacular opener, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13710-sleeping-ute/"">Sleeping Ute</a>"", is the lone track retained from an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8856-grizzly-bear/"">aborted early session</a> in Marfa, Tex., and it feels like a continuation down the path Daniel Rossen ambled on his 2012 solo EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16394-daniel-rossen-silent-hourgolden-mile-ep/""><i>Silent Hour/Golden Mile</i></a>, which sought solace from a busy life in the elements. ""If I could be still as that gray hill,"" Rossen pines, before giving into an admission of humanness: ""But I can't help myself."" Chris Bear's drum rolls emulate thunder while chords crest with the rhythm of waves. ""Sleeping Ute"" moves so evocatively and theatrically like water that it sounds like a big-budget radio play of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Tempest</i></a>. But as grandiose as it often gets, ""Ute"", like <i>Shields</i> itself, always retains a certain intimacy. These are dark and anxious waters, the choppy and tumultuous movement of the sea inside.</p>
<p>Grizzly Bear have acquired a reputation for politeness; maybe it was the bow ties, maybe it was the passive-aggressive inflection of their most famous lyrics (""Would you always? Maybe sometimes? Make it easy?""), maybe it was just that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11483-while-you-wait-for-the-others-ft-michael-mcdonald/"">Michael McDonald collaboration</a>. But <i>Shields</i> serves as a visceral reminder of how unsettled and uncanny Grizzly Bear's music often feels. (Remember that superbly creepy <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjecYugTbIQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for ""Two Weeks,"" full of smiles pulled tight enough to induce nightmares?) The pair of lead-off singles, ""Sleeping Ute"" and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13989-yet-again/"">Yet Again</a>"", each find a way of transcending the tension of ""putting on appearances,"" one of Grizzly Bear's favorite themes. The lyrics of the Droste-led ""Yet Again"" detail repression and repose (""Take it all in stride/ Speak, don't confide""), which makes the payoff-- a final minute of instrumental fury lead by the torrent of Chris Bear's percussion and the squiggling lightning strikes of Rossen's guitar-- that much more cathartic. Dynamic shifts like this give the record an air of uncertainty that contrasts with the sheer beauty of the arrangements. </p>
<p>Grizzly Bear is a democracy. They stand in a horizontal row on stage, and you get this sense of intra-band egalitarianism from their records, too. By now, each of the four members has cultivated his own unique and expressive vocabulary, and each feels integral to the sound of <i>Shields</i>. Chris Bear's drumming is lyrical and swift, moving from delicately timed details to big, booming ruckuses (check out the way his percussive rumbles in the background of the verses of ""Yet Again"" foreshadow its avalanche of a conclusion), while Chris Taylor's penchant for haunting effects and gently buoyant grooves adds an otherworldly weightlessness to these soundscapes. Droste's voice resounds with ache and longing, and there's a newfound and welcome gravel to his vocals that add a raw, unvarnished quality to songs like ""The Hunt"" and ""Speaking in Rounds"".</p>
<p>But <i>Shields</i> showcases Rossen's growth most of all. The songs that sounded distinctly his on <i>Yellow House</i>-- ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POCV842BFo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Little Brother</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwP2R1YEjzg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On a Neck, On a Spit</a>"" in particular-- were grounded in a familiar folk sound. But from the rollicking strums that propel ""Speaking in Rounds"" to the creaking, rusted textures he teases out of ""The Hunt"", Rossen's playing on <i>Shields</i> is a seamless blend of folksy textures, jazzy fluidity, and proggy imagination that feels downright inimitable. <a href=""http://jonimitchell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joni Mitchell</a> has called her own idiosyncratic tunings as ""chords of inquiry,"" and this feels like an apt term for the tones and inflections that Rossen conjures too. They're stirring precisely because they're unresolved: the progression that ends ""Speaking in Rounds""' chorus, for example, chirps like a series of unanswered questions, each one a little more urgent and insoluble than the last.</p>
<p>And that's a great part of Shields' emotional pull: The album reverberates with a sense of irresolution. This was present before with Grizzly Bear-- <i>Yellow House</i>'s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLaI1EyfitU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Colorado</a>"" concludes with a fireworks display of unanswered pleas: ""What now? What now? What now?""-- but never to such a degree. And it's that tension that makes returning to <i>Shields </i>so rewarding. The final one-two punch is a stunner, where the poignant grace of ""Half-Gate"" gives way to the magnificently epic ""Sun in Your Eyes"". If ""Sleeping Ute"" was the start of a sojourn from society, ""Sun"" ends not with a return but a transcendent kiss-off: ""So long, I'm never coming back.""</p>
<p>This closing pair of songs speaks to the album's complexity. Despite the formalism and easy-to-love production, <i>Shields</i>' best moments inflict a sense of unease that wriggles under the skin and lingers after the final crescendo. But this collection of unvarnished shipwreck-spirituals is after something more challenging than a feel-good ending. With <i>Shields</i>, Grizzly Bear make certain demands--hold still, listen closely-- that seem downright radical in a busy and impatient world.</p></div>"|17037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17037-shields/|9.1|Lindsay Zoladz

This is a fantastic prospect surely stoking our 1990s nostalgia and wiping the weird taste of her previous album off our palates, but it doesn't quite hold. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Tucker is now a grown-azz, 39-year-old woman, and on <i>Kill My Blues</i> she tackles topics that weren't on her riot girl radar at 20: mortality, the joy of conception, how she could use a vacation. She is singing from the perspective of her life as the mother of two kids who's maybe a little wistful for days when her life was a little more carefree and Joey Ramone was still above ground. Her rage is no more than that of any American who's paying attention in 2012.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's only natural that we'd want Tucker to stay put in her <i>Revolution Girl Style, Now!</i> pose. Who wants our rock stars to get old? To change? Rock'n'roll is the province of the young. Therein lies the discomfort of our icons' maturing and making records that reflect their evolving ken. Fandom would be so much tidier if they could keep neatly fitting the nostalgic niche we hold for them in our hearts. (""My old life is dead,"" sings Tucker, joyful on ""Blood Bones and Sand"", her song about the maternal tether.) Tucker is at the fore of the generation of post-grunge boom indie rockers, punks who were close enough to glean the sad lessons of heroin and major label deals from a safe distance, and subsequently they are still alive and fortified by the same communities that fostered them making music in the first place; it might be a while before we see any of these folks ""age out"" of the DIY scene.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And so there we are with <i>Kill My Blues</i>, on the heels of Tucker's solo debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14700-1000-years/"" target=""_blank""><i>1,000 Years</i></a>, a record the sounded better on paper than in real life (it turned out Tucker's Joni-phase produced her <i>Hejira</i> rather than her <i>Blue</i>). On tour, Tucker saw how drumless balladry wasn't energizing her fans that live and love for her scream and guitar sheroics-- and so begat this return to form.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The good news is the Corin Tucker of <i>Kill My Blues</i> is not the Corin of Heavens to Betsy, nor is she the same woman we knew from that year when <i>Dig Me Out</i> forever blared from the stereo. The range of her voice is more expansive, and there is an absolute control here that she's never had before; when she goes full-throttle, the effect is stunning. Perhaps she's outgrown some Olympia-born punk shame about being a full-fledged rock singer; no longer aiming for raw and ragged and instead giving us the full Benetar. It's Tucker's voice that gives <i>Kill My Blues</i> its thrills.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On album opener ""Groundhog Day"", Tucker sings of coming to after years busy with raising her young family, amid the GOP's War on Women, confronting the same battles for women's lives and bodies that riled her two decades ago. She points the rhetorical finger at herself, asking, ""Did I fall asleep/ On the backs of the women that come before me?"" Musically, it's the closest thing to a Sleater-Kinney moment on the record, spirited and gnashing. Tucker's band are formidable old hands all-- onetime Unwound drummer Sara Lund, one of the underground's great distinctive players and <span class=""s1"">Seth Lorinczi of Circus Lupus (if you are old) and Golden Bears (if you aren't) and Mike Clark, the spare guy in the Jicks-- they give the pensive album some thrust. The strange part is that Tucker still plays as if Carrie Brownstein and Janet Weiss were at her side; there is a space around her that feels like it needs to be filled, her antic rhythm and tempo don't always settle with Lund's in-the-pocket playing. </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">The album starts strong, but is uneven, dragging toward the end. The high points are the ""Teen Spirit""-bite and twinkling keys of ""Constance"", and Tucker's blistering tribute to Natalie Cox, ""I Don't Wanna Go"". The album's best moment-- the bridge and solo flourish on ""Joey""-- happens two minutes into a song that otherwise goes nowhere. The cutesy ""Summer Jams"" feels long at four minutes and Tucker employs a string of clichés that are below her faculties. The album is self-produced and at times it seems they could have benefitted from some outside ears to help tighten things up. Tucker is unquestionably at the height of her power as a vocalist, but there are times where even that can't buoy <i>Kill My Blues</i>.</p></div>"|17043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17043-kill-my-blues/|6.5|Jessica Hopper

Geddes Gengras and Cameron Stallones, aka Sun Araw. The Congos are responsible for one of the most venerated albums in reggae history (1977's <i>Heart of the Congos</i>); Stallones is a guy from Long Beach who records gooey half-songs and peppers his interviews with reflections like ""life's a trip, but it's heavy, too,"" and ""you have to just learn to continually create the situation inside yourself.""</p>
<p>The pairing-- part of RVNG Intl.'s FRKWYS series-- seemed wacky but ultimately highlighted more similarities than differences. Sun Araw tracks usually consist of a few basic things: slow, bubbling drum machine patterns, strobing synthesizers, and guitars processed to sound like the trickle and buzz of a jungle at night, or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B17OvPYM040"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Rube Goldberg machine burping up its springs</a>. Occasionally, Stallones is inspired to sing, and when he is, he tends to keep it simple. (Most of his lyrics sound like variations on ""alright!,"" ""yeah!,"" or ""alright, yeah!"")</p>
<p>The connection to reggae isn't in the tracks' composition, but in their texture and vibe. Like a lot of prime 70s Jamaican music, Sun Araw albums function like a sonic sweat lodge: hot, trippy, and claustrophobic, but joyful at their core, a collection of a thousand sounds bumping into each other in a humid room.</p>
<p>His last two albums, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14480-on-patrol/"">On Patrol</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15771-ancient-romans/"">Ancient Romans</a></i>, could be as dense as Pink Floyd and 70s Miles Davis-- two good musical approximations of pitch blackness. His newest album, <i>The Inner Treaty</i>, focuses on a lighter, more scattered side of his sound, a sound rooted in gospel and the positive, mystical explorations of jazz artists like Pharoah Sanders and Alice Coltrane.</p>
<p>Of course, this is still Sun Araw, and the end result still basically sounds like a neon compost heap. The difference between <i>The Inner Treaty</i> and <i>On Patrol</i> or <i>Ancient Romans</i> is scale: This time around, the heap seems a lot smaller. The mix isn't as cloudy either. Instead of letting everything melt together-- ""melt"" being the most important verb in the Sun Araw dictionary-- Stallones keeps all the sounds pretty well delineated. The sounds themselves are more cartoonish, too: the squiggles squigglier and the farts farther. The result is an album both more contained and more chaotic-- the sound of something icky growing in a petri dish.</p>
<p>One interesting thing about Stallones' music in a broader sense is how much more it relies on black and nonwestern sounds than on white, European ones. Stallones isn't the only young white artist who could be named here, of course-- the slow rebranding of R&amp;B as something hip and artistically credible is part of the conversation, too. Fifteen years ago, ""experimental"" and ""noise"" music was descended primarily from classical composition, synth labs, or largely male populations figuring out how to make weird, harsh-ass sounds on shoestring budgets. Now reggae and dub are familiar touchstones for twentysomething bands on cassette labels, and you get art-world-approved musicians like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> naming DJ Screw as an influence-- evidence that the terms on which music being made by groups like Stallones' are changing.</p>
<p>Stallones' particular gift is creating a space where things are always either barely coming together or almost falling apart-- a space where music can sound like it's coming to life on record. My understanding, though, is that most of what Stallones does is improvisational, and my guess is that committing any of what he does to record is just playing the game of how music is traditionally released into the world-- as physical product. In that respect, <i>The Inner Treaty</i>-- like all Stallones' albums-- is less a jewel box of finely honed compositions and more a rough sketch of how Stallones is currently thinking about how music might be put together. <i>On Patrol</i> and <i>Ancient Romans</i> were foggy and inward-spiraling albums; <i>The Inner Treaty</i> is clear, toylike, and sometimes even funny.</p>
<p>His closest relation in recent history is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1411-excepter/"" target=""_blank"">Excepter</a>, a Brooklyn band whose single greatest talent as musicians was being able to sound like they'd unlearned how to play music entirely. And like Excepter, Stallones seems more concerned with producing a lot of material than perfecting any of it. That's no slight. Part of what's exciting about an artist like Stallones is that you know he's already on to the next thing. <i>Icon Give Thank</i>, the Congos collaboration, came out in April. Two imaginative, weird, genre-pushing records in one year-- not bad.</p></div>"|17041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17041-the-inner-treaty/|7.0|Mike Powell

From that first moment on, the album makes plain that Chasny has made another of his trademark directional shifts, this time affording himself a backward glance before training his eyes back to the horizon.</p>
<p>The album represents Chasny's semi-reunion with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Comets on Fire</a>, the much-beloved acid/noise group which has been on extended hiatus since 2008. The core of Comets on Fire-- guitarist Ethan Miller, bassist Ben Flashman, drummer Utrillo Kushner, and multi-instrumentalist Noel Von Harmonson-- are all present here, and together they help Chasny pummel some new tracks and reconfigure several from his vast back catalog. The Six Organs of Admittance concept has always been open-ended enough to include pretty much whatever and whomever Chasny wants it to at any given time, but <i>Ascent</i> is clearly the work of a full-fledged band. Though the results are perhaps not as heady as some of Chasny's best acoustic-based work on 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15185-asleep-on-the-floodplain/"" target=""_blank""><i>Asleep on the Floodplain</i></a> or 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7203-school-of-the-flower/"" target=""_blank""><i>School of the Flower</i></a>, and it is not as monumentally heavy as Comets on Fire at their peak, it is an invigorating detour and one of the most naturally fun records in Chasny's discography.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""http://www.uncut.co.uk/blog/wild-mercury-sound/interview-six-organs-of-admittance"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent Chasny interview with <i>Uncut</i> magazine</a>, <i>Ascent</i> had its genesis nearly a decade ago, when Chasny was planning to record a Six Organs album with the Comets on Fire crew but decided to join their band instead. If anything, however, I think the argument could be made that this material was better served having been put on the backburner for so long. Had it come out then, it might have been swallowed up within the overall Six Organs/Comets deluge, whereas now there is a palpable sense of joy in Chasny's playing as he locks in with his old mates.</p>
<p>And lock in they do. The contrasts between <i>Ascent</i> and an actual Comets on Fire record are subtle but crucial: Chasny takes all the guitar solos, Van Harmonson switches from electronics to guitar, and Chasny's durable songs tend to allow for more open spaces and a broader array of interpretation. The original recorded version of ""Closer to the Sky"", released on 2003's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7200-compathia/"" target=""_blank""><i>Compathia</i></a>, features acoustic strumming, hand percussion, and a luminous lo-fi glow. Here the song is converted with surprising ease into a lumbering psychedelic behemoth, with the rhythm section of Flashman and Kushner providing an unimpeachable foundation beneath Chasny's fluttering vocals and unhinged soloing. Similarly, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13997-one-thousand-birds/"" target=""_blank"">""One Thousand Birds""</a> gives an acid rock makeover to track from 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7199-dark-noontide/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dark Noontide</i></a>, with the group's guitars layered with enough care to provide an impressive depth of field while still delivering an exhilarating live-band-in-a-room immediacy.</p>
<p>As with Comets on Fire, the psych-rock on <i>Ascent</i> can feel unabashedly retro. Chasny seldom neglects his wah-wah pedal for long, and his playing carries many of the same Eastern flourishes so prevalent in his collaborative work with Sir Richard Bishop in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28815-rangda/"" target=""_blank"">Rangda</a>. Although it can hearken back to 1960s groups like Blue Cheer or Barrett-led Floyd, the over-amped squall puts me more in mind of such Terrastock-era groups as High Rise, Bardo Pond, or Major Stars. For Chasny, a musician who has spent most of his creative life in the narrow spaces between various folk and improvisational idioms, the album does run the risk of seeming just a high-spirited genre exercise. Nevertheless, the group's obvious enthusiasm for the project is contagious, and together they add another memorable benchmark to Chasny's formidable body of work, clearly having a fantastic time while doing so.</p></div>"|17185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17185-ascent/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

Since going duo in the 1990s, Joey Burns and John Convertino have evoked the Southwest United States in heady, careful detail-- not only in sad stories about border crossers, doomed drivers, and restless wanderers, but in slyly adventurous music that combines Latin American traditions with North American rock'n'roll sounds. Impossibly, they showed such a keen facility with those styles and such a commitment to that sound-- and, by virtue, to that place-- that these two gringos never came off as exploiters or tourists. So it makes sense that Calexico would be involved in immigration reform efforts: For one thing, how could you live with yourself in Arizona and not be involved? For another, their music has proved that the borders between styles can be as blurrable, as mutable, as porous as those separating countries and cultures.</p>
<p>Burns and Convertino have recorded nearly every Calexico release at their WaveLab Studio in Tucson, which has proved popular with acts like Amos Lee and Neko Case as well. They've been so associated with those concentric locales-- the studio within the city within the state within the region within the country-- that it seems especially significant that they chose to record their latest album, <i>Algiers</i>, elsewhere. The duo, along with producer Craig Schumacher, trekked east across New Mexico and Texas and set up shop in perhaps the most storied and tragic city in the United States: New Orleans. The album is named for a neighborhood on the southwest banks of the Mississippi River, home to krewe dens, Catholic churches, jazz clubs, and more than a few Katrina-flooded homes.</p>
<p>It doesn't sound like they left Tucson at all, which is slightly disappointing but which might actually be their deftest trick: <i>Algiers </i>carries very little of the city's baggage. No one is going to argue for this as a post-Katrina album (or even a post-Isaac album). There are watery allusions peppering these songs, as when Burns exhorts, ""Take it all the way down/ below the water line,"" on first single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13706-para/"" target=""_blank"">""Para""</a>, but that has more to do with burying the past than reviving it. There's something refreshing about this approach, as it opens up the city to new ideas and new moods and new meanings, placing that horror into a larger historical continuum.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if place defines <i>Algiers</i> as much as that album title signals, it must have done so in the creative process, as these songs never sound too far removed from Tucson or from the raft of Calexico's catalog. On one hand, there are no Mardi Gras trinkets on this album, no street bands or zydeco flourishes, no Quintron or Trombone Shorty or Dr. John, no hoodoo charms or Saints gear. Burns and Convertino went east to make another western record, one that even indulges Spanish-language lyrics and songs about sacrifices to Quetzalcoatl (""Puerto"" may be the most overcooked thing Burns and Convertino have set to tape). <i>Algiers </i>sounds great, with a noticeable sensitivity to instrumental interplay and an emphasis on Burns' conspiratorial vocals, but the album is haunted by the missed opportunities to absorb the particulars of this neighborhood and reflect that in the music.</p>
<p>What we're left with, after a few spins have dispersed expectations, is another solid Calexico record, impeccably conceived and imaginatively crafted. Such consistency may gnaw at any excitement over a new installment from the band, which means <i>Algiers </i>never sounds quite as momentous or as immediate as 2003's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1230-feast-of-wire/"" target=""_blank""><i>Feast of Wire </i></a>or even 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12175-carried-to-dust/"" target=""_blank""><i>Carried to Dust</i></a>. But that may only be a way of saying that the record demands more time and more spins before it burrows into your head. There are certainly enough moments to hook your interest: the dissonant cascade of strings that ends ""Para"" and hints so vividly at something horrible; those lovely ghost vocals on ""Fortune Teller""; the sparkling tango theme on ""Sinner in the Sea"" that rises into a tense and fractious crescendo.</p>
<p>Opener ""Epic"" even manages to live up to its title, beginning with a single, steady, insistent acoustic strum that just hangs in the middle air, suggesting a kind of weightless motion-- as though Burns and Convertino were positioning the listener just out of the way of song's action. It's a sound and technique they've used on nearly every Calexico album, and as such it's become instantly recognizable as Calexico. While it may sound familiar, it's nevertheless effective, ushering you you into the world of this album. And ultimately, it is a different world from those evoked on previous albums, one thoroughly shaken by the tectonic cello rumble that undercuts the violent squalls of electric guitar. Perhaps this is the power of New Orleans working on a musically subatomic level, determining decisions made just out of earshot. The result is an album that never sounds settled or still, defined not by one or another place but by the tumultuous spaces in between.</p></div>"|17033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17033-algiers/|7.3|Stephen M.

But there's a reason its chronology cuts off when it does, round about 1992: That particular 4-track era came to a decisive close once Josh Davis' upgraded budget led him to jump ahead of the sampling technology curve and forgo the tried-and-true SP-1200 for the advanced capabilities of the Akai MPC60 MkII. So while DJ Shadow was developing his style and production technique, getting his foot in the door with labels like Mo' Wax, and cutting his teeth on production jobs for Blackalicious, he was also exploring the possibilities of a machine that was still a few years away from becoming a hip-hop industry standard. The machine in question would eventually be the conduit through which he created the entirety of <i>Endtroducing….., </i>so it's safe to say he got the hang of it. But Shadow was and remains something of a perfectionist, and it's worth asking whether his early experiments and castoffs are worth hearing even if they're not quite perfect enough.</p>
<p>Worth hearing? Probably, but not entirely worth flipping out over. <i>Total Breakdown: Hidden Transmissions from the MPC Era, 1992-1996</i> is, if anything, an archive-plundering curiosity that feels more like the underlying woodshedding sessions of Shadow's career than a missing piece of it. Expecting anything on the order of ""In/Flux"" or ""Organ Donor"" or his UNKLE work is a good way to set yourself up for disappointment-- these are sketches, not lost classics. Shadow's dive into his own personal DAT vaults dredged up hundreds of tapes, a little over an hour's worth of which makes it here; since narrowing it down that much means that the best of the rest are decent at most, this is probably the closest you'll get to hearing him freely dink around with the sampler he'd eventually wield like a scalpel.</p>
<p>The base appeal here is to hear him piece together the building blocks-- mostly some deceptively simple drum breaks-- and catch him leaning towards ideas he'd later expand on, stuff that's more interesting for what it would later become than what it initially was. The most recognizable example is a track dubbed ""Aye"", which rides on the thumb piano riff he'd later use for <i>The Private Press </i>highlight ""Giving Up the Ghost"" but without that track's masterful slow build or its crashing waves of percussive buildups and breakdowns. As it is here, it's a couple of minutes' worth of primordial proto-trip-hop built around a heavy, straight-ahead, no-nonsense break that reveals his ear for beats at their most unadorned and immediate-- though the way he chops the beat up every few bars and incorporates a floaty little psychedelic-soul guitar riff here and there hints at more familiar things to come. Other cuts like ""Vee in Detroit"", ""Freddi's Popcorn"", and ""Dreams of a Piece"" are little more than the sum of their drums, heavy-hitting backbeats that never got significantly built upon but would've probably sounded monstrous with a little more orchestration. There's not a lot of dynamism here, and the bulk of the tracks-- or at least the ones below the three-minute mark-- start out as intriguing loops that eventually wear out their welcome in the process of going nowhere special.</p>
<p>And yet it isn't hard to tell that Shadow was on to something, mastering the MPC's capabilities of assembling and accommodating increasingly complex drum patterns while picking up a few characteristic melodic flourishes along the way. ""Fast Rap Fanfare"" is one of the first things he did on the MPC, and one of the longer excursions on this collection, six-plus minutes of an enthusiastic maniac testing out his new toy like a tweaker with a shiny Countach, 100 miles of straightaway and no traffic in sight. It starts out as a simple loop based around the kind of uptempo break early-90s Rakim did damage over, but soon enough it starts to break down into the occasional well-timed roll or chop, early feints at the Buddy Rich fusillades that would dictate the crescendos of cuts like ""Building Steam With a Grain of Salt"" and ""Napalm Brain/Scatter Brain"" some four years later. (Shame about the horns, which sound like Pete Rock's brass if it had the soul of a car alarm.)</p>
<p>His tendency to incorporate the dustier, trippier corners of rock, funk and soul jazz crops up in the margins of otherwise-simple demos like ""Mystical With Solo"", ""Affectations"", and ""Mellow But Chunky"". And a handful of demo tracks intended for an aborted EP with Gift of Gab-- ""Movin' On"" and its Attack of the 50-Foot Ziggy Modeliste stomp, the gooey funk of ""Total Breakdown"", the intense symphonic soul of ""Perilous Journey"" and the ""Six Days"" prototype ""Swimming Upstream""-- work well as instrumentals in their own right, with nothing else that needs to be added but a voice. Anyone who listens to this now might think there's something a bit lacking, but anyone who listened to it then would be justifiably amped to hear what this Shadow kid would come up with next.</p></div>"|17145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17145-total-breakdown-hidden-transmissions-from-the-mpc-era-1992-1996/|6.0|Nate Patrin

Where <i>With U</i> was situated in the muddled aftermath of a relationship, <i>Held</i> is deep in the clutch of one. Or, more precisely, concerned with the natural push-pull impossibility of oneness. </p>
<p>Having spent much of the latter half of 2011 and beginning of 2012 performing with a veil over his head, Holy Other stands naked on <i>Held</i>. The vulnerability that has become his hallmark is more potent than ever, stretched like skin across nine tracks-- or nine movements-- that trace love's arc of complex intimacy and ever-evolving emotional epiphany. Desire, neediness, vulnerability, fear, pleasure, and confusion are all laid bare. <i>Held</i> is a love album, a modern love album. Not love as aspirational fantasy but lived love, contradictory love-- the real love that stifles as much as it soothes. In that, it has a kinship with a generation of artists, including How to Dress Well, the xx, and Mount Kimbie, who reach to articulate love's many aspects in new ways.</p>
<p>The Burial-recalling distorted vocal elements Holy Other teased into being on <i>With U</i> are again deployed here, distilled to their base energy and impulse. Where garage, R&amp;B, and pop all channel a predominantly feminine pressure, the power of <i>Held</i> balances on its call and response between both masculine and feminine elements, most notably on ""Past Tension"" where two voices venture ""I was...I was..."" back and forth to poignantly familiar effect, recalling a relationship's occasional veer into petty power struggle. How much Holy Other can say while saying very little is perhaps his greatest skill. The abstract lack of directness is somehow more direct: When all the words have been said, when the snap of their intention grows slack with overuse, only touch says what is truly meant.</p>
<p>The first three seconds of <i>Held</i>-- announcing question-and-answer track ""(W)here""-- are a roar of submersion, a displacement to Holy Other's underwater world where meaning and emotion are fluid, never fixed. As if to illustrate, his slippery approach to language is extended to his titling. ""Inpouring"", the album's closest connection to <i>With U</i>, suggests a play on imploring and outpouring, and evokes that flood of emotion from one to another that can often feel like assault. Glowing with golden chimes and Janet Jackson finger clicks, ""In Difference"" is the flip to ""Inpouring"", an expression of fatigue from the latter's torrent of emotion with its delicate plea to ""beat my heart,"" perhaps because the protagonist no longer has the energy.</p>
<p>""Love Some1"" is the most dramatic moment on the album, wracked with loneliness and a dead-of-night intensity. While it has a thriller-movie tension-- its scissor synths recalling <i>Psycho</i>'s shower scene-- the call and response of ""Love someone/ Me, me, me"" realizes a much more prosaic yet no less chilling fear.</p>
<p>Having played up duality throughout the record, <i>Held</i>'s climax is its two-part finale of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13885-held/"" target=""_blank"">""Held""</a> and ""Nothing Here"". The title track representing humanity's greatest desire fulfilled: to be held, to be comforted, to be loved. Halfway through its racing pulse-like beat and waves of warm low-end give way to piano chords that sound out like a sweet release from consciousness. On ""Nothing Here"", love's embrace is replaced with an image of what follows all of life's yearnings: the nothingness of death, itself the final embrace. Or perhaps that's getting too melodramatic, something that listening to <i>Held</i> at length will do to a psyche-- or maybe not; Holly Other paints life, entrails and all. His music is of the wholly sensual, painfully physical kind, and with <i>Held</i> he triumphantly translates his bruised intimacy to full-length format without losing any of its skin-prickling power.</p></div>"|16971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16971-held/|8.0|Ruth Saxelby

But it's helpful to remember that his artistic position has basically been the same from the start. He's a craftsman of, as a friend described it, ""cozy sweater folk"". From the outset, <i>Palindrome Hunches</i> feels like the kind of hushed, close-gathered singalong that's been idealized in indie rock since the start of the millennium.</p>
<p>The opener ""Digging Shelters"", in its calmly melancholy way, and the softly chugging ""Bad Drugs and Minor Chords"" that follows it, essentially define where the rest of the album goes. Between those two poles there's some variety; it does get a little too samey by the end, albeit never without feeling pleasant. Adding to the cozy feel, we're told<i> Palindrome Hunches </i>was recorded live in a weekend at a music room in a UK primary school.</p>
<p>So, theoretically, it's neither Slowdive nor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2803-mojave-3/"" target=""_blank"">Mojave 3</a>; instead, it's the kind of understated solo release that tips its hand to Nick Drake (""Full Moon Rising"" is one of many moments where you basically can't think of anyone else) as much as it does a whole swathe of early-70s, acoustic guitar-based releases, Halstead singing a half-whispered reflection on where everything's been in his life and others. At this point, he's not about reinvention so much as he is exploring possibilities from a central start.</p>
<p>Returning to the first Slowdive release, the self-titled 1990 EP, where both versions of ""Avalyn"" open with a treated acoustic strum and where on the first one Halstead's vocals (blended with Rachel Goswell's) are delivered softly and calmly, what has changed most in Halstead's work isn't the wellspring, per se, but the means of delivery. He has, even at Slowdive's loudest and Mojave 3's most sweeping and stately, always implicitly argued for the virtues of gentility, of understated retrospection and performance, and emotion recalled afterward. It's little surprise that the crypto-goth/post-punk roots of Slowdive via bands like the Cure and early New Order tie into this sense of splendid near-isolation, and that a solo career by default puts the focus all the more clearly on this core.</p>
<p>So if ""Wittgenstein's Arm"" draws its lyrical inspiration from the story of a wounded pianist from World War I (and therefore includes piano) and if the title track is indeed all about palindromes (you'll never think of Satan quite the same way), then everything still comes back to that point of origin. But as with his earlier bands, it's the choice of arrangements and performance that drives his solo work, a specific aiming for a sound. Halstead's performing reinvents no wheels but never is anything less than well-done regardless, and the full performances can often find their own impact, the violin of Ben Smith-- one of several performers from Band of Hope playing as the backing group throughout-- often providing a softly killer touch on songs like ""Love Is a Beast"", ""Full Moon Rising"", and especially in the nervous opening moments of ""Tied to You"".</p>
<p>By the time of the piano-led ""Hey Daydreamer"", one of the peppier songs in context, the album's been the type of thing that seems right for the closing in of the year through fall, something best heard in fading light, bundled a bit against the cooler air, a little shared warmth-- cozy sweater folk, indeed. Nope, it ain't shoegaze as it's been codified and re-codified. But why be disappointed in someone following his muse to a logical conclusion when that path was always the one he walked on?</p></div>"|17036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17036-palindrome-hunches/|7.1|Ned Raggett

The ""He"" in the title refers to God. Around the time of the record's release in 2009, vocalist Jon Parkin was <a href=""http://www.decoymusic.com/artists/gaza"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">quoted</a> as saying ""<i>He Is Never Coming Back</i> is a knife pushed slowly through the temple and into humanity's primitive religiousness. It is a call to utilize the same logic and reason applied in every other aspect of our lives in the assessment of theology."" And when <a href=""http://stereogum.com/105281/haunting_the_chapel_3/franchises/haunting-the-chapel/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I spoke to him about the record</a> shortly after it came out, he told me, ""We wanted this record to pick you up and death shake you like a dog would snap a rabbit's neck. And to once in a while stop to lick the blood running from your nose."" The frontman, who is 6'7"", and wears his hair close-cropped, clearly isn't afraid to use colorful language when making a point. The music's just as intense and amped on <i>No Absolutes in Human Suffering</i>, the Salt Lake City, Utah, grindcore band's third album-- and best to date.</p>
<p>It works so well because they find a balance between melody and cacaphony. The 11-song collection was produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"" target=""_blank"">Converge</a> guitarist Kurt Ballou, who gives Gaza's warped blend of grind, hardcore, and crust a dense, sturdy feel. On <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/GAZAMUSIC"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their Facebook</a>, the band calls what they do ""progressive crust"" and ""math piss."" The first works, but I might change the latter to ""math pissed off."" Like Gaza's past work, the music here is a dense and intense, a twisting, churning spin on noisy grind with a tendency toward rock'n'roll. The songs, with their constant warping mutations, feel like they're melting. Outside the more mid-tempo title track, and the closing dirge, it's unrelenting. Even when songs are longer-- the six-minute ""Not With All the Hope in the World"", which moves from a blur to a beautiful sludge anthem, to that surprisingly plaintive, doom closer ""Routine and Then Death""-- the pieces never stop throwing unexpected shifts at you. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14085-the-vipers/"">""The Vipers""</a> melds hyper grind, a mid-tempo breakdown, indelible melody, and a noise-rock pep talk. It's a dexterous showing: math rock made up of violent equations.</p>
<p>In a self-penned bio, the group refers to themselves as ""failed emo musicians."" A joke, maybe, but there is plenty of emotion and emoting here. Parkin reminds me of a short story writer in some ways, or Converge's Jacob Bannon writing for Harvey Milk. His lyrics are sketches and observations that move from the economy (""I understand we have invented ourselves out of a job""), playful anti-religiousness (""It sure was nice of Jesus to take time away from ignoring/ Ethnic cleansing genocide and famine-bloated children/ Or regrowing limbs for landmine victims/ To help you score that touchdown""), the generally political (""Know your children will know more of this earth than you ever will/ You should be embarrassed/ I can hear them laughing at their history books""), to tracks that remind me of punk zine <i>Cometbus</i>, or the poetic manifestos of the anarchist collective Crimethinc. In ""Routine and Then Death"", for example, the only words we get are ""It's the same noise every day/ We walk back and forth."" Parkin finds a way out of that cycle in ""Skull Trophy"" via ""a deer carcass someone had cleanly taken the head off of"" that he passes in his car. As he puts it, in a way that I find fairly romantic, ""I thought of you/ I knew you'd find it full of wonder/ Someone had desecrated a corpse for a sportless opportunistic skull trophy/ That alone is some hillbilly shit/ But the bigger picture is that we've lost feeling in our left arm."" Best pickup line of the year.</p>
<p>For all the challenging complexity, this is music that sticks in your head. <i>No Absolutes</i> opens with the wobbling post-rocking drone of ""Mostly Hair and Bones Now""-- the track ushers in a huge grind explosion after 50 seconds-- and moves through the AmRep muscularity of the title track to the proggy soloing/post-rock slipperiness of ""When They Beg"" to the jazz breakdowns at the start of ""Skull Trophy"". You get the point. Amid all this chaos, though, there's calm. Amid the anger and bile, a discernable beauty. Gaza are a rare band in this way-- an uncompromising group that should appeal to folks who don't usually stock grindcore in their music collection, all without trying, in the least, to win them over.</p></div>"|17102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17102-no-absolutes-in-human-suffering/|7.4|Brandon Stosuy

That's surprising given how sharp and precise the band's music has often been. Sink your head into this engrossing 4xCD set-- a collection of their work as a sextet in the mid 2000's-- and what pins your brain are all the repetitive stabs, staccato bursts, and bullet-like beats. In other words, what saxophonist Sam Hillmer aptly calls ""that pointed 'bam' sound.""</p>
<p>Ironically, that meticulous, rapid-fire approach has helped Zs become blurry in the way Mincek intended. By bringing the sheet-music rigor of classical to avant-prog, by injecting the energy of free jazz into chamber music, and by playing horn-led mostly-instrumental tunes in rock clubs, they've smeared divisions between genres, carving out a distinct mark at the end of the musical alphabet. The results may blur lines, but they rarely sound vague-- Zs pieces are usually recognizable within seconds of an initial sax blurt, snare shot, or guitar loop.</p>
<p>Given that strong sonic personality, you might think the 4.5 hours of music on <i>Score </i>would get tedious, and that such relentlessly punchy songs could be exhausting in big doses. But having this much Zs all in once place-- there are eight records represented here, plus an hour of previously unreleased work-- makes it clear how much variety the sextet has managed to wrangle out of such a tight, disciplined approach. Just as each laser-focused song zooms in on small parts and tiny shifts, <i>Score </i>turns subtle differences between tracks into exciting new developments.</p>
<p>There's also something about listening to this much Zs that makes me less conscious of ingredients and patterns, and more able to hear it all as one flowing body of work. Take the ironically titled ""I Can't Concentrate"", an 11-minute piece that hammers at its cycling figures with dizzying focus. Before it's even half over, I forget about tracking each note and instead let the piece pour into my ears, as if it were a kind of inverse magic eye painting. (It helps that ""I Can't Concentrate"" ends with a palate-cleaning bit of wailing free jazz). That track comes from <i>Arms</i>,<i> </i>perhaps the strongest record here, but there are many other spots on <i>Score </i>where hard-turning loops can mash your brain into blissed mush.</p>
<p>If that sounds more excruciating than fun, be advised that the extra material sprinkled throughout <i>Score</i> adds texture and diversity, helping the band sound three-dimensional. Energetic remixes-- particularly two by <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1411-excepter/"">Excepter</a>'s Nathan Corbin-- do part of that job. But the richest bonus comes from concert recordings. Zs have always been a phenomenal live band, often sitting in a circle and leaning into the music until their breath and sweat coats the room (Mincek himself thought of Zs as ""one big muscle."") Some of the recorded evidence here-- particularly a tense version of the bubbling ""Bump""-- captures that experience with impressive accuracy.</p>
<p>That real-life accuracy is something I've found occasionally lacking in Zs studio albums. I thought that was corrected by 2010's excellent <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14230-new-slaves/"">New Slaves</a>, </i>but now I wonder if I wasn't wrong about these early records too, which feel infused with much more blood and guts than I remember. And the imagination in the compositions and precision in their execution gives <i>Score </i>a cumulative effect. That's not to say that any of these records-- except perhaps <i>Arms</i>-- is a masterpiece on its own. But when you take them all in together, Zs sure do sound like masters of their craft.</p></div>"|17104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17104-score-the-complete-sextet-works-2002-2007/|7.8|Marc Masters

Dylan's long-lauded backing band, which has helped define much of his later work, may crank out a first-rate iteration of honky-tonk bar-rock, but it's primarily a canvas. His voice is so unique (even when it's approximating other voices) that I crave it the same way I might crave, say, an apple: It's a thing unlike any other thing, a whole food, a singular expression.</p>
<p>Still, on <i>Tempest</i>, his latest album, Bob Dylan mostly sounds insane. That volatility can yield tremendous rewards-- on the ferocious ""Pay in Blood"", it clarifies his nihilism, his cruelty-- but it can also be distractingly unruly, inching toward self-mockery, all wild undulation and hairball-retch. Which would be okay-- embraced, even!-- if the rest of <i>Tempest</i> didn't feel so rote. Here it is, again: the gargle, the zinger, the rollicking blues riff. The formula that made <i>Time Out of Mind</i> through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9361-modern-times/"" target=""_blank""><i>Modern Times</i></a> such a thrilling stretch feels exhausted now, and Dylan relies on his own gruffness as a substitute for real intent; he knows he doesn't have to work very hard to sound present, and so he doesn't, and so he isn't.</p>
<p>Lyrically, he's sharpest when eulogizing mangled relationships (""One time, for one brief day, I was the man for you,"" he seethes on ""Long and Wasted Years""), and the best cuts here are the ones that directly address lingering heartache. On ""Soon After Midnight"", he speaks to an absent lover: ""It's now or never, more than ever/ When I met you, I didn't think you would do/ It's soon after midnight, and I don't want nobody but you,"" he sings. It's a classic <i>Blood on the Tracks</i>-era barb, vitriol mixed with real longing-- rage and love, rage <i>at</i> love. Likewise, on ""Narrow Way"", he admits inferiority (""I can't work up to you/ You'll surely have to work down to me someday""), then accuses his girl of certain cruelties (""You broke my heart/ I was your friend 'til now... You got too many lovers"").</p>
<p>At just under 14 minutes, the album's epic title track is also its longest (worth noting: It outruns ""Desolation Row"" (11:20) and ""Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands"" (11:22), but not ""Highlands"" (16:31), <i>Time Out of Mind</i>'s sprawling closer), a sober and meandering meditation on the sinking of the Titanic. In the pantheon of grand, gory tragedies, the dismembering of the Titanic via iceberg is a catastrophic entry, sure, but its legend still trumps its carnage, making it worth wondering why Bob Dylan, in particular, would suddenly revisit it a solid century on. In her essay ""7000 Romaine, Los Angeles 38"", Joan Didion, writing both of the Titanic and of Howard Hughes, hints at the inescapable glee of <span style=""mso-bidi-font-style: italic;"">schadenfreude</span>, how we (quietly) relish the beautiful becoming the damned: ""Our favorite people and our favorite stories become so not by any inherent virtue, but because they illustrate something deep in the grain, something unadmitted,"" she writes. ""<i>How the mighty are fallen</i>.""</p>
<p>""Tempest"" is based at least in part on ""The Titanic"" (or ""When That Great Ship Went Down""), an old folk song that likely originated around 1915 in Hackleburg, Alabama, and has since been recorded by Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie, and others. In his notes for the 1997 reissue of Harry Smith's <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i>, Folkways archivist Jeff Place notes that some African-Americans viewed the Titanic's dissolution as a kind of ""divine retribution,"" given that blacks were resolutely banished from the ship (indeed, the version recorded by William and Versey Smith for the <i>Anthology</i> is conspicuously spirited). Here, though, Dylan is earnest, nearly deferential. It's not <span style=""mso-bidi-font-style: italic;"">schadenfreude, or retribution, or even a social commentary; it's a long, sad, straightforward narrative, complete with</span> a ""little crippled child,"" self-sacrifice, hearts at peace, and a final glug of brandy as the ship slips under. ""There is no understanding... the judgment of God's hand,"" Dylan announces, and I suppose that's as reasonable an explanation as any, although it's also a disappointingly pedestrian conclusion from an artist as acerbic (and populist) as Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>And so it's revealed that death-- mass death, helpless death, inevitable death-- is the real story here, and <i>Tempest</i>, for all its detours toward sadness and alienation, is very much a record about The End. Whom we loved, who failed us, and what it all means in the face of our own inevitable demise. Dylan's long been enamored with Appalachian murder ballads-- those gruesome, Celtic-born parables designed to dissuade potential sinners from indulging their darker whims-- but he's finally learned, at 71, that death doesn't necessarily come with a lesson, sometimes it just comes.<i> Tempest</i>'s moving closing track, ""Roll on John"", a remembrance of John Lennon, suffers from a few flaccid clichés (""You burned so bright!""), but at least Dylan finally sounds engaged, his garbled vocals heavy with sorrow and helplessness. In that sense, it's a fitting coda for an album bogged down with resignation.</p></div>"|17139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17139-the-tempest/|6.8|Amanda Petrusich

The author of this review, who read the interview in question, indicates that the similarity was not intentional. Pitchfork regrets the error.</i></p>
<p>What's worse: the encroaching feeling that something's going terribly wrong, or the fallout from the inevitable? On 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14463-mines/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mines</i></a>, not much was going right for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2892-menomena/"" target=""_blank"">Menomena</a>'s Danny Seim, Brent Knopf, and Justin Harris. The band was <a href=""http://wweek.com/portland/article-12437-everyone_loves_menomena_except_menomena.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hardly talking</a>, their inability to communicate in a civilized fashion meaning that the record took over three years to complete. Something had to give, and Knopf <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41142-brent-knopf-leaves-menomena/"" target=""_blank"">left</a> the band. Seim and Harris figured out their communication issues, laying bare to one another their proposed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8885-menomena/"" target=""_blank"">subject matter</a> for Menomena's first record as a duo: Seim's realization that he had spent more time alive without his mother than with her-- she died in 1994-- and the fact that Justin's mother had essentially raised him alone, his father a frequently flighty and difficult Vietnam veteran. It's not exactly the kind of thing that calls for balloons and party streamers, yet <i>Moms</i> largely eschews the weighty devastation of <i>Mines</i> for an unusually dramatic tone; the most notable example of which are Justin's saxophone parts, now more like fanfares than harbingers of doom. It's feasible that the record's bold sound might have been conceived to compensate for Knopf's absence-- and not in a bad way-- though it's hard to see how the vagaries of the songwriting that Knopf demonstrated on his most <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16610-prophet/"" target=""_blank"">recent album</a> as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27858-ramona-falls/"" target=""_blank"">Ramona Falls</a> would fit into <i>Moms</i>' emotionally raw feel. These aren't so-called naked songs in the singer-songwriterly sense; <i>Moms</i> often feels like turning up to a family function in the buff, and letting everyone have it.</p>
<p>If <i>Mines</i> was about possession-- note the cute baby grab of the title-- then <i>Moms</i> concerns itself with what we're given by others; ancestry, in a word. But the push and shove here is how these familial endowments inspire gratitude and resentment. ""Hail Mary, is this golden ticket all that you've left me? For the therapists to pawn off and retire on the proceeds?"" goes ""Baton"", one of Seim's songs that deals less with regret than the anxiety over memories slipping away-- like ""I wish I could remember if my last words were sincere."" (The ominous and distant ""Tantalus"", the name of a street near where Seim grew up in Hawaii, seems to be about revisiting childhood as a tourist.) It freewheels through different intensities-- a light organ and skewy drum solo in the verses, gradually intensifying to a chorus that's blustering and huge, but made up of the erratic samples that characterized their earlier work, which is definitely a tendency now more particular to Seim than Harris.</p>
<p>True to the <a href=""http://wweek.com/portland/article-12437-everyone_loves_menomena_except_menomena.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> that originally revealed the band's fractious relationship, Harris is considerably more direct lyrically. (As an aside, it's quite eerie how much both men sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"" target=""_blank"">Damon Albarn</a> vocally.) ""Baton"" is followed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13897-heavy-is-as-heavy-does/"" target=""_blank"">""Heavy Is as Heavy Does""</a>, which opens with a bitter conversation between the piano's high, pleading notes and unwavering lower end, Justin cutting straight to the chase: ""Heavy are the branches hanging from my fucked up family tree."" Come the end, bouts of saxophone inflate and burst, combining with squealing guitar for an effect akin to driving around hairpinned back roads in the dead of night, the rain pounding like bullets.</p>
<p><i>Moms</i> is without doubt the most aggressive record Menomena have ever made. ""Giftshoppe"" gamely bowls along with the sweet, rhythmic chant peculiar to so many Menomena songs before wreaking a course of total disorientation; piercing piano reeling around huge drum fills (it's one of Seim's) and blurry synthesizer hazes that slosh rapidly between the speakers. Masculinity comes in for a kicking too-- ""You perverted, aging fuck/ What age did your mind get stuck?"" Seim sings nonchalantly, possibly to a mirror. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14181-pique/"" target=""_blank"">""Pique""</a> has less jagged, more luscious production (though bears quite the guitar solo towards the end), but sees Harris once again compete for the record's most affecting lyrics: castigating his dad for his haphazard upbringing, making him ""a failure, cursed with male genitalia/ A parasitic fuck with no clue as to what men do, and impossible to love."" The note with which he holds that last line feels like the climax of some (admittedly unusual) rock opera with a very non-rock opera subject; testosterone, you got a lot to answer to.</p>
<p>It's not tough to guess which ""tiny muscle"" Seim is pleading to work at the beginning of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14094-capsule/"" target=""_blank"">""Capsule""</a>, where he's ""like a nervous random stranger at a glory hole."" The song kicks off with a growling guitar lurch, veering into a verse characterized by the kind of bassline that's as cool as a stoner that keeps their wit about them even at points of maximum intoxication. Perhaps it's endemic of his being a ""perverted, aging fuck"" that talk of glory holes gives rise to recollections of his mother, though his realization that ""we never talked on a cellular telephone"" is a mark of his age and era. Things get darker on Harris' ""Don't Mess With Latexas"", a conflicted ode to the seduction of someone half one's age (and IQ) which heralds its subject with elastic guitar splurts that sound like the products of windmilling arms, choral ""huh huh huh""s adding to the theatricality. The only rumination on the subject not wrought by self-flagellation is the jaunty ""Plumage"", which opens <i>Moms</i> in a similar way to how ""Queen Black Acid"" opened <i>Mines</i>-- as someone slips away, though this time Harris is pleading rather than admitting defeat: ""I don't want to be just anybody to you/ I want to be your one and only mate for life/ Instead I'm just like everybody else who's tried.""</p>
<p>The thing with songs about relationships is that the lyrical denouement needn't be the end. The arcs of these stories are varied, but cyclical; plenty more fish in the sea, and all that. The familial, ancestral, genetic subject matter of <i>Moms</i>, however, only has one resolution, the certainty of which Seim entertains towards the end of ""One Horse"", a 10-minute epic where stark cello snips stand on ceremony as the rest of the song crumbles like a cliff face: ""I know the ending/ Yet I'm faking suspense/ We're fertilizer for the trees/ From dust to dust, roots will pass through us."" Although <i>Moms</i> is the result of its two creators' putting themselves through the wringer, it never feels overshadowed by dread. Whether the downward spiral or the fallout, Menomena are pros at putting on a game face.</p></div>"|17035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17035-moms/|8.0|Laura Snapes

Sunglasses firmly in place above his signature unflappable grin, Rodriguez says, ""It's the music industry. There are no guarantees."" He's right, and eventually he gets his reparations with stretch limos, white carpets, and yearly sold-out shows in Cape Town. But his Zen attitude is still frustrating. Doesn't he hate Bob Dylan<i> just a little?</i></p>
<p>We get more of an answer from singer-songwriter Chris Porterfield, whose overshadowing Voice of a Generation is Justin Vernon. In <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/field-report-set-a-course-for-breakout-debut-20120504"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview with <span class=""s2""><i>Rolling Stone's</i> Steven Hyden</span></a>, Porterfield said he was proud of his former bandmate in Wisconsin folk collective DeYarmond Edison; but he let his Minnesota niceness lapse long enough to feel ""gross jealousy"" toward Bon Iver. As Hyden noted, the feeling is only human: Both sprang at least somewhat formed from the same fertile Midwest territory and traffic in meditative, solo acoustic folk, but Vernon's meteoric rise to fame has since eclipsed Porterfield's empty open-mic nights and stints opening for better-known bands-- including Bon Iver-- under his former pseudonym, Conrad Plymouth.</p>
<p>Now rechristened <a href=""http://www.field-report.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Field Report</a>, Porterfield continues to be dogged by headlines like <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2012/04/chris_porterfie.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">""Chris Porterfield is Field Report (and used to be Justin Vernon's bandmate)</span>.""</a> Other than his one-time confession to Hyden, Porterfield has publicly shown no signs of resentment toward Vernon. In fact, he embraces the relationship, recording <i>Field Report</i> at Vernon's April Base studios and even drawing inspiration from him, saying in the same interview that he admires Vernon's continuing loyalty to the Midwest. ""He made me think that someone not living in a major city, who writes stuff that he believes in about stuff he went through, that people want to hear that.""</p>
<p>Lyrics like ""This bitterness was killing me all along/ I am not waiting anymore,"" the loosely analogized ""I spent eight long years working on my screenplay"" (""I Am Not Waiting Anymore""), and ""I just want to speak the truth/ I have not been able to"" (""Captain Video"") belie those warm and fuzzy feelings. It's not like Porterfield tried to conceal the somewhat autobiographical origins of his lyrics any more than he's hidden his last name behind an anagram, but he wrote some conspicuously analogous situations that reveal a rawer nerve than he's disclosed in interviews. Was Porterfield seething during the long years he spent working in an admissions office while his friends were getting nominated for Grammys and bringing back dad rock? Probably, but that's just the music industry.</p>
<p>One of the differences between Porterfield and Vernon is that the latter has a story and the voice to tell it, even if you can't understand what he's saying half the time. Field Report, while eloquently assembled from bits and pieces of Porterfield's former projects and influences, doesn't bring anything like that to the contemporary Eau Claire folk tradition. Opener ""Fergus Falls"", for example, was actually a Conrad Plymouth track. This time around, Porterfield shows restraint, replacing the piano with banjos and sinking the drums lower in the mix. It burns slowly and efficiently, from the hollow opening twangs to the rousing, closing canon. He could have drawn from Smog's <i>A River Ain't Too Much to Love</i>, which Porterfield <a href=""http://ghettoblastermagazine.com/2012/bands-on-bands-chris-porterfield-field-report-on-smogs-a-river-aint-too-much-to-love/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">admires</span></a> for its ""clean but small"" guitars and ""detailed but universally nostalgic lyrics.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Bill Callahan is all over this record, from the endlessly repetitive chords to the naturalistic ""vistas of buckthorn and tamarack"" in ""In the Year of the Get You Alone"" to Porterfield's deadpan talk-sing. Field Report has got the detailed and nostalgic part of Callahan's lyrics down pat, namedropping over 100 proper nouns into the 15 songs that were whittled down to the album's 11: Doris Day, Glen Shirley, Dom DeLuise, JonBenét Ramsey, the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862. But unlike Smog and ""Fergus Falls"", they're excessive. Callahan can say something like <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2011/04/18/110418crmu_music_frerejones"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""<span class=""s3"">special underwear</span>""</a> and people will listen, but Porterfield sounds like he doesn't actually know what he's talking about. There are times when it works, like the juxtaposition of Dahmer and Liberace on ""Incommunicado"", which alludes to Porterfield's current home of Milwaukee while playing to his strengths in multi-part harmonies.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mostly, Field Report sounds a lot like his old band. When listening to an album like <i>Silent Signs</i>, you can hear the vestiges of Megafaun's telltale banjo twangs and early Bon Iver's lightly brushed drums, but you can also hear how both bands have naturally evolved into autonomous, quite distinct entities; so distinct that Porterfield felt out of place on a recent tour with Megafaun, his former musical collaborators. When Field Report deviates from DeYarmond Edison's retrospectively entry-level folk, however, it's jarring. <i>Bon Iver</i>'s unabashedly luscious synthpads float like dry ice across the bottom of ""Taking Alcatraz"" and ""Evergreen"", filling the spaces between unadorned guitar strums better left unsaid.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And there's Field Report's conundrum: He doesn't quite do enough to differentiate himself, but when he does, it sounds forced and unnatural. That might be due to the music industry or timing-- it's as if Mike Heidorn decided to have a solo career after <i>Summerteeth</i>-- but it's more likely due to Porterfield's still-developing talents as a solo artist.</p></div>"|17103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17103-field-report/|6.6|Harley Brown

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Following his album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16468-iradelphic/""><i>Iradelphic</i></a> from earlier this year, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/throttleclark"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clark</a> has already moved on, his natural inclination for restlessness leading him to rework three tracks from that LP and adding them to another three new recordings for this EP. Read up on Clark's recent studio output and live performances, and the word ""psychedelic"" will crop up, although it's difficult to match up this music with the true definition of the word. These tracks don't represent some kind of mind-altering tussle with the doors of perception. But, to be fair to Clark, nor does most music described that way. Instead, much of <i>Fantasm Planes</i> rests in quietly reflective passages of sound, edging close to the rustic-electronic idyll that a number of British musicians in this realm find consistently alluring. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This is a bump back down to earth instead of a total removal from it, a shying away from the cartoony blitz-out of prior Clark releases like the synapse-shattering originality of his 2008 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11240-turning-dragon/""><i>Turning Dragon</i></a>. Many artists who appear to make it their mission to hurtle relentlessly into the future find that the past has a way of coming up in an outside lane to overtake them. If that was the case for Clark on <i>Iradelphic</i>, which was backed into a corner with no particularly interesting place to go, on <i>Fantasm Planes</i> it feels like he's lapping himself several times over. For someone once so resolute on finding new lines to trace out for himself, it's remarkably easy to figure out how Clark got to where he wanted to go here. Even the title of ""Henderson Swooping"", an almost unrecognizable retool of the folksy ""Henderson Wrench"" from <i>Iradelphic</i>, owes a considerable debt to the oft-whimsical ways of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Despite the creeping feeling of genre exercises playing out, there are moments to seek solace in on <i>Fantasm Planes</i>. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14143-fantasm-planes/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> works in a jazzy lightness reminiscent of the type of electro-fusion crossovers former Warp signees <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3546-red-snapper/"">Red Snapper</a> were attempting in the 1990s, all set to beats so bouncy it feels like you can reach out and stretch them. On ""Fantasm Planes"" there's a sense of narrative, a feeling of a story being set in motion and playing out, full of bends in the road that take time and thought to navigate and digest. That's when Clark excels across all his work, making it even more disappointing when the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex</a>-by-numbers ambience of ""Dove in Flames"" brings this EP to a limp close. ""Brigitte"" verges on that territory, too, but gathers some clout of its own as Clark does some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29644-blanck-mass/"">Blanck Mass</a>-style empire building, only to tear it all down in flames at the end.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""Brigitte"" is a useful musical metaphor for Clark's endless urge to enter a cycle of construct, destroy, renew. Just when it feels like he's onto something, he discards it, perhaps with more haste than he should. Clark may complain, with some justification, that he'd be accused of repeating himself if he settled into a recognizable style and worked up multiple variants on it. But <i>Fantasm Planes</i> is a series of loose ends that lack the sense of purpose and playfulness that made his prior work such a persuasive listen. Even the one vocal contribution, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4347-martina-topley-bird/"">Martina Topley-Bird</a> on the reworking of ""Secret"" (titled ""Secret Slow Show""), is an uninspired choice. It's a needless hark back to an older era, clumsily falling into 90s trip-hop pastiche when the beat kicks in during its final third, with Topley-Bird wheeled in just as she was back then to provide suitably ""spacey"" vocals. Clark can, and hopefully will, do better. But for now he feels like a genuine talent unable to find a foothold.</p>

As the former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4787-be-your-own-pet/"" target=""_blank"">Be Your Own Pet</a> members <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/turbo-fruits-talk-new-album-strange-influences-and-vinyl-20120908"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told <i>Rolling Stone</i></a>, the album was recorded under the influence of Lil Wayne, 1970s soul, and Enya. Let that potpourri of sounds and influences simmer, because there's another thing you should know about <i>Butter</i>: Lyrically, it's an album of post-Garth Brooks country radio songs. There's no twang, over-glossy sentimentality, or patriotism-on-steroids flag waving. But while nothing here can be pegged as country sonically, their lyrics follow the same direct and literal ""I'm telling a story and here's what happened beat-for-beat"" frame of country radio at its most cliche. Which is not to knock an entire songwriting style-- there are obviously great songs that fit within that structure. These, however, are not great songs.</p>
<p>Here are the opening lines of ""Don't Like to Fight"": ""Drinkin' Jack, getting lit/ Group of girls comin' up to us/ We could tell they was into it/ Saw a dude givin' dirty looks/ With his friend, talking shit/ Then a man came up to me and said/ 'Boy, you talkin' to the wrong chick.'"" If that verse were an exception, the record could be saved, but predictability sets in hard. There's a song about gambling (called, ugh, ""Gamble Tamble"") that confidently overgeneralizes about ""how the game is played."" ""Colt 45"" is a song about shooting a man. There's a song about riding off on a motorcycle. Then we get to summer lovin', drinking, weed, cigarettes, and other carefree-but-edgy material. Their subject matter draws an easy comparison to another recent Nashville song, JEFF the Brotherhood's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47051-video-jeff-the-brotherhood-sixpack/"" target=""_blank"">""Sixpack""</a>, but in this case, the good times aren't the celebratory focus-- they're props used to make egregious storytelling sound relatable, or worse, ""badass.""</p>
<p>What partially saves Turbo Fruits from their own lyrics is their knack for muscular riffs. Get past the words, and ""Don't Like to Fight"" is a rock'n'roll song worthy of Motörhead. It's got distorted guitars, muscle, and, yes, ""the fight riff."" Same deal with ""Where the Stars Don't Shine"", which was a ripping one-take live recording. They even manage to stick the landing on the instrumentation of their lighter fare, like the mellow jangle of ""Gotta Get Along"", the summertime balladry of ""She Said Hello"", and the swooning chorus on ""Harley Dollar Bill$"" (in case you thought there was only one awful song title). But to its detriment, it's easily the most hi-fi, slick-sounding album the band's put out, which strips away some of the ragged bite of their first two records. It's an intentional move; as the band's Jonas Stein <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/news/turbo-fruits-ready-to-butter-up-fans-with-1007946232.story#/news/turbo-fruits-ready-to-butter-up-fans-with-1007946232.story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told <i>Billboard</i></a>, ""Man, we're ready to start being able to pay our bills. Our hope is that this record takes us to the beginning of that goal."" Also worth noting: The band's polished new sound is housed on Kings of Leon's label.</p>
<p>With <i>Butter</i>, Turbo Fruits have offered a carefully honed caricature of themselves. They tell stories about bar fights, about gambling, about hitting the road, about drinking and smoking pot. And as if that picture still wasn't clear, right before the final track, you can hear producer Jim Eno (of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3916-spoon/"" target=""_blank"">Spoon</a>) saying, ""Yeah, we'll do a sober take tomorrow, guys."" Because they're drunk! That's just how rebellious they are! They <i>drink</i> in the <i>studio</i>! But as Stein <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/turbo-fruits-talk-new-album-strange-influences-and-vinyl-20120908"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">noted</a>, all the ""don't give a fuck"" posturing wasn't reflected in the band's process: ""I've never been more prepared for recording a record in my life. We had a no-mess, non-stop work ethic."" Sadly, the hard work backfired. By aiming for so many different styles, settling for subpar-at-best lyrics, and trying to pay the bills with rock'n'roll, they never find a sound that's fully captivating or convincing.</p></div>"|17141.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17141-butter/|5.3|Evan Minsker

The irony was not lost on Thee Oh Sees' frontman John Dwyer, who, despite getting their show off to a righteously arse-kicking start, jokingly begged to the crowd after three songs ""don't leave!"" as Segall's set time approached. This simple, self-deprecating plea effectively delineated the difference between these two like-minded, furiously prolific acts.</p>
<p>Segall, after all, is in the midst of a banner year that's seen him release two albums-- including his best to date, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16744-slaughterhouse/"" target=""_blank""><i>Slaughterhouse</i></a>-- with a <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/47109-ty-segall-announces-yet-another-new-album/"" target=""_blank"">third</a> on the way, and he's still young enough that his whimsical, impulsive approach to recording forms a media-friendly narrative of the punk wunderkind realizing his true potential. On the other hand, Thee Oh Sees are the latest, albeit the most durable, in a long, 15-year lineage of Dwyer-helmed projects, and one whose consistency-- in terms of both quantity and quality-- makes for a somewhat less sexy story. Dude releases a shit-ton of records because, after all these years in the game, he's still restless and resourceful.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Putrifiers II</i> is Thee Oh Sees' first album of 2012, which is a weird statement to be typing considering that we're well into September. (Though given the band's ceaseless output, it's not too far-fetched to imagine that a <i>Putrifiers I</i> was recorded and scrapped somewhere along the way.) Thee Oh Sees' records have more or less charted the band's evolution from Dwyer's solitary psych-pop project to brute-force hypno-punkers. Now, with their reputation as one of America's most redoubtable live acts wholly assured, Thee Oh Sees use <i>Putrifiers II </i>to explore the possibilities of the studio and more lustrous modes of psychedelia. It's not exactly uncharted territory for Dwyer and company, but where Thee Oh Sees are prone to segregating their more refined pop sensibilities from their gonzo-rock rave-ups (as their two 2011 releases, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15540-castlemania/"" target=""_blank""><i>Castlemania</i></a> and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16013-carrion-crawlerthe-dream/"" target=""_blank""><i>Carrion Crawler/The Dream</i></a>, respectively illustrate), <i>Putrifiers II</i> reconciles these two modes, providing a more complete, elaborate picture of this band's many capabilities and strengths.</p>
<p>Which is to say: If the sheer enormity of Thee Oh Sees' dense discography has proven too forbidding for you to delve into, <i>Putrifiers II</i> is a convenient summary/gateway, opening with a killer shot of the band's patented echo-drenched fuzz-punk delirium (""Wax Face"") and closing with a baroque, string-swept lullaby (""Wicked Park""), while traversing all points in between. But even as <i>Putrifiers II</i> turns more melodic and mellow, broadening the band's sonic scope with strings and woodwinds, it retains the nervy irreverence: With its shrieking cello line and opium-den ambience, ""So Nice"" unabashedly kneels before the shiny leather boots of the Velvet Underground's ""Venus in Furs"" and, as such, becomes a knowing allegory for the master/slave dynamic that plays out in the original.</p>
<p>If the drawn-out title-track dirge and the moonlight-strolling ""Will We Be Scared?"" (the sort of warped, revisionist 50s-style ballad Bradford Cox has made his stock-in-trade) threaten to curb the mid-album momentum, they prove to be effective calm-before-the-storm set-ups to the mighty <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13797-lupine-dominus/"" target=""_blank"">""Lupine Dominus""</a>, which manages to condense everything that is great about Thee Oh Sees into three thrilling minutes: Dwyer and Brigid Dawson's eerily androgynous harmonies cooing a disarmingly childlike melody, and a car-crash tangle of guitar/organ noise, all hitched to a steely Krautrock pulse. It feels like the sort of song that, after so many years of exploratory recordings, could very well define the true sound of Thee Oh Sees. Or it's the sort of peak moment that could give Dwyer reason to tear it all down and radically redefine his band once again. At the very least, we know it likely won't be long before we find out.</p></div>"|17029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17029-putrifiers-ii/|8.1|Stuart Berman

Website Chattarati <a href=""http://chattarati.com/culture/music/2010/12/1/babblers-debut-discoteca-will-oldham-tow/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reported</a> that, among songs that sounded more traditionally Oldham-like, there was also ""charged-up punk that featured Angela Babbler screaming down the throats of the front row."" It turned out that Angela Babbler, whose voice was described as ""blood-curdling"" by another site, was actually the Missouri-born, Chicago-based singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"" target=""_blank"">Angel Olsen</a>, and that the ""charged-up punk"" was a cover of Kevin Coyne and Dagmar Krause's ""Sweetheart"", from their 1979 album <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Kevin-Coyne-And-Dagmar-Krause-Babble/release/1945488"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Babble</i></a>-- an old favorite of Oldham's.</p>
<p>Since then, Olsen has formed part of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28652-bonnie-prince-billy-the-cairo-gang/"" target=""_blank"">Cairo Gang</a> that performed on Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's recent records, and she's toured with them too-- though her extraordinary voice has set her miles above the backing-band parapet. Halfway through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15886-wolfroy-goes-to-town/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wolfroy Goes to Town</i></a>'s ""Time to be Clear"", she breaks through the welcoming lull with a wordless melody as casual but striking as a ditty that Edith Piaf might have hummed whilst hanging out the washing. Trade ""blood-curdling"" for ""blood-chilling""-- she doesn't sound of this world. ""When something like that happens, I don't know how to feel,"" Oldham said of Olsen's improvised warble, in a Pitchfork <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8684-will-oldham/"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. ""It's almost like I get hollowed out and then filled, but I don't know what it's with. It's a mixture of apprehension and satisfaction at the same time.""</p>
<p>Olsen's voice is possessed of an intensely dramatic range; one minute she's barely singing-- more a downcast, near-spoken tumble of words-- but the next, she's a tragic heroine of the Weimar cabaret, tremendously poised but letting emotion rag her throat as if a freight train were passing through. Hers is not a voice made for modern laptop speakers. Its chalky squeak will earn lazy comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Newsom</a>; really, her palette is a mixture of the great, lost singer <a href=""http://connieconverse.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Connie Converse</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2899-jason-molina/"" target=""_blank"">Jason Molina</a>'s old-timey drama, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Callahan</a>'s terrific and unsettling ability to shift between dourness and comfort, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3003-nina-nastasia/"" target=""_blank"">Nina Nastasia</a>'s graceful lope. Olsen's voice is extraordinary and unequivocal, which makes the way she uses it to sing of the most profound doubts on the follow-up to 2010's initially cassette-only <i>Strange Cacti</i> even more affecting.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href=""http://www.chartattack.com/features/2012/08/29/uncharted-angel-olsen/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, Olsen talked about how she was born into a big family, but was eventually adopted, crediting her uncle and biological mother as being ""a huge part"" of why she plays music. She hasn't told the story of her adoption beyond that, aside from that she was given a keyboard as a parting gift before leaving her birth family. ""You can imagine why I became attached to it,"" she said. That instrument barely figures on <i>Half Way Home</i>, which is mostly made up of stitches of acoustic guitar gathered into a loose but regular weave, soft double bass, and the odd patch of stark, rudimentary drumming. You get the impression that Olsen would find using the keyboard in her solo material too literal, too personal; she's spoken of her concern that there's often ""too much self"" in songs, and there's only one here that's set in any kind of concrete scenario rather than on a psychological stage.</p>
<p>Sliding in with mournful electric guitar, ""Lonely Universe"" concerns the loss of a mother figure at a time when ""I was only a child, about to lose my child-like mind."" Her brothers and sisters can't help; the ambulance comes anyway, leaving Olsen dressing for school, floating as ""a lonely universe."" It's a heartbreaking acoustic-and-brushes sway, where her vocals, at their most dramatic, call to mind a tender Elvis, or convey the affect of a piece like Gavin Bryars' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/resonant-frequency/7810-resonant-frequency-70/"" target=""_blank"">""Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet""</a>. It's also a canvas for Olsen's most elegant strokes of wordplay: She sings about the departing ""sweet mother earth"" as if she had been a lover-- ""the way you touched my hands like you never had before,"" ""You won't always understand when you've truly loved someone until after they've gone."" (The previous song, the slow and spare ""Safe in the Womb"", talks of motherly comfort, and the protection offered by states outside of being alive; pre-life, after-life, mental purgatory.) Lyrical statements are proffered and then cut poignantly; towards the song's end, she wryly refers to the loss of her childlike innocence in more general terms: ""Well, losing your mind, it ain't half as bad as it seems."" Double-take, and and the devastation builds up. You can't blame her for the doubt that sets in-- ""time to give up that unforgiving act of altogether-ness."" Go for broke, be selfish, abandon connections, community, and family, because what good did they do you anyway?</p>
<p>Olsen knows betrayal like the best of them: On ""Miranda"", she's a sheriff reading someone their rights, though the soft Emmylou Harris hurt and creak of her voice when she sings, ""I love you dear, but it's not up to me/ And it's never quite been, you see,"" suggest that the guilty party's transgressions are emotional rather than legal. ""Some of the things that you've said in my ear/ As you open a door and casually smile.../ How I have wanted to scream out/ All of the things that entered my mind,"" goes the end, in the record's only instance of her being driven to speak her many thoughts aloud.</p>
<p>Belief and the futility thereof scar <i>Half Way Home</i>'s glowing skin. ""Always Half Strange"" sounds like a curio recovered from turn-of-the century Europe, that casual, romantic drama filling Olsen's voice again as she fingerpicks gently. It finds her in a state that preoccupies her throughout the record-- ""half life and half dream, and half crazy to believe in anything it all."" She hides out in her mind, working out the value and meaning of things and people, and often judges her own worth by how much she weighs on another's mind. (""Oh, to be that distant thought/ Some growing memory/ In your mind,"" goes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14146-acrobat/"" target=""_blank"">""Acrobat""</a>.) Here, things exist only if you believe in them, and it's easy to see how the precariousness of that idealism might leave you feeling a tad shaky: On the ominous, classical ""The Sky Opened Up"", Olsen ascends to a gap in the heavens, and returns to ""see things just as they are""-- ""appalled at what I had found."" Whatever she sees up there imparts the distressing truth that, ""If you dare to be true to what you believe/ There's always somebody to lose.""</p>
<p>It's no coincidence that Olsen receives this damning truth from a place beyond life: One belief she sustains across the album is in the finality of death. The great beyond strikes fear into many, but for Olsen, at least it puts a cap on the uncertainty of living. What's striking is that her ruminations on the subject are never morbid or even particularly sad. ""If only we could understand each other, I'd happily die,"" she sings on ""Can't Wait Until Tomorrow"", one of the album's only slightly weaker tracks; rawer, even, than anything on <i>Strange Cacti</i>. ""I thought this time last year, I'd be dead,"" she recalls on the conversational, largely plainspoken ""You Are Song"", as if recalling a more casual expectation-- improving at French, or learning to bake bread.</p>
<p>For anyone starting to worry for Olsen's emotional health, there are patches of warm, inviting firelight away from <i>Half Way Home</i>'s darker corners. The certainty of her feelings in the opening song, the waltzing ""Acrobat""-- ""I love the way your body's made/ I love the way your voice is sex""-- revives Olsen, who had assumed herself to be dead, her voice cracking with a renewed burst, almost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/"" target=""_blank"">Antony</a>-like in rapture. And there's a tremendous, near-girlish and flirtatious feel to ""The Waiting"", which also proves the greatest employ of her slight backing band; electric guitar as sharp as wires bursting from fixtures, a soft male chorus, that conversational, cantering double bass. Dreamy and wry at the prospect of being swept off one's feet, it could nearly be a modern interpretation of ""Fools Rush In"" from the woman's perspective-- and there's something about it that calls for a male vocal to duet with Olsen, though the fact that she shirks the obvious speaks volumes about her distance from trad country tropes. And on the flippy, festive ""Free"", she takes incremental steps towards infatuation: ""Sometimes I have to take you in my arms/ Press your heart against my heart, oh!/ You know, each day it means a little more."" Come the end, she's a congregational rogue, breaking ranks to exclaim that she ""can only reach him in my mind"" in the kind of voice that makes skirts billow, surprised.</p>
<p>What makes <i>Half Way Home</i> magnificent is its openness to what could be, to potential. Yes, we're all going to die in the end, and you can get there by casting off all belief and going it alone, or gathering moss and weighing heavier, leaving a mark, going the distance with company. It's the battle between the internal and external, the transference of intention to what's really conveyed; the tug of war between wanting to be something to someone and offering them yourself in return, while keeping something for self-protection. It's a very open record about what goes on behind a staunch emotional guard; what Will Oldham said about that ""mixture of apprehension and satisfaction at the same time"" rings completely true. That battle and potential is best summed up in a line from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14023-tiniest-seed/"" target=""_blank"">closing song</a>: ""It's known that the tiniest seed is both simple and wild.""</p></div>"|17154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17154-half-way-home/|8.0|Laura Snapes

<p class=""p1"">When <a href=""http://www.theraveonettes.com/splashpage/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Raveonettes</a> burst out of Copenhagen 10 years ago, they recorded each of their albums under a strict creative constraint, which seemed a bit arbitrary at the time. Every song on their 2002 debut EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6697-whip-it-on/""><span class=""s1""><i>Whip It On</i></span></a>, was written in B-flat minor; B-flat major defined their first full-length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6698-chain-gang-of-love/""><span class=""s1""><i>Chain Gang of Love</i></span></a>, a year later. For catalog highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11184-lust-lust-lust/""><span class=""s1""><i>Lust Lust Lust</i></span></a> in 2008, Sune Rose Wagner trashed all the crash cymbals and played all the instruments himself. ""I always put a little bit of restrictions on myself, and I only do it for my creativity,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6779-the-raveonettes/"">Wagner told Pitchfork that same year</a>. ""And I do it sometimes because I want the music to stand out a little bit more than many other bands do.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Those restrictions distinguished their first batch of albums, and even the subtle loosening up on 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6699-pretty-in-black/""><span class=""s1""><i>Pretty in Black</i></span></a><i>, </i>their most polished and, some might say, overcooked record, gave it a specific sonic identity. Moreover, it implied a sense of growth and development, painting Wagner as something of a gleefully mad scientist; despite being dismissed as gimmicky, the Raveonettes prospered in the wake of the millennial garage rock movement, even as groups like the Vines withered and fell away. In retrospect, those restraints seem impressively savvy, as they always kept new ideas and new moods in reserve.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Perhaps because those simple guidelines so defined those early releases, the piano appears to play a much more prominent role on <i>Observator</i>, their latest album, than it actually does. It's the main instrument on the second track and early single ""Observations"", which marks the first time the Raveonettes have showcased the instrument in their music. It suggests a musical theme for the record, as though Wagner had challenged himself to write every song on keyboard instead of guitar. Especially following the skeletal, spryly despairing opener ""Young and Cold"", the piano's heavy sustain becomes a kind of drone in itself, slyly tweaking our expectations for shoegaze drift. Those pounded chords square off against the sharp notes of Wagner's rockabilly guitar to give the song its perverse, nocturnal vibe, which suggests the Raveonettes<i> </i>possess the power to transform even the sunniest afternoon into post-hangover 3 a.m. In a year when one of <a href=""http://youtu.be/Sv6dMFF_yts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the biggest pop hits</a> evokes the vodka-commercial glamor of a night spent club hopping with attractive friends, ""Observations"" picks up the party a few hours later, when all your friends have abandoned you and you're not sure how you're going to get home.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A full album in this vein sounds promising, but unfortunately, <i>Observator </i>has no interest in teasing out that mood or even using that instrument again. The piano is quickly discarded and with it any sense of the album as a distinct entity in the Raveonettes' later catalog. They can still set a specific mood with just a few notes, and Wagner and Sharin Foo deliver some of their spryest hooks on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13849-she-owns-the-streets/"" target=""_blank"">""She Owns the Streets""</a> and ""The Enemy"", but these songs sound suspiciously light, lacking the urgency or stakes of their best material. Especially on the second side, Wagner indulges a particular strategy of repeating lines until they resemble hooks without actually hooking you. Especially sequenced back to back, ""Downtown"" and ""You Hit Me (I'm Down)"" quickly become grating, making even a short album-- just over thirty minutes-- sound interminably long. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Wagner has <a href=""http://www.vicerecords.com/vicerecords/artists.php?artist=RAVEONETTES"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">written</a> that he was listening to the Doors while he was writing these songs, which is a dangerous prospect for any artist. The Raveonettes even recorded several tracks at Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles, where the Doors recorded their debut. In fact, the Raveonettes have always had a promiscuous relationship with pop history, dredging grungy 1950s juvie rock and 60s girl groups through 70s punk and 90s shoegaze. A decade into their career, on <i>Observator</i> they seem to be settling comfortably into themselves, integrating their influences and fascinations into lush drones and dark riffs. But it's hard to shake the feeling that the album sounds too comfortable, too familiar: It's so deeply entrenched in their comfort zone that it sounds too easy-- not effortless, but automatic and rote. There's too little joy in their lyrical or stylistic transgressions, as though they're content to simply observe rather than take action.</p>

For going on 20 years, Koster's been instrumental in shaping the sound of Elephant 6's sprawling psychedelia, lending his singing saw (and his considerable compositional expertise) to Neutral Milk Hotel and the Olivia Tremor Control, to his own Chocolate USA and the Music Tapes. Though the weird whinny of Koster's favored axe and his symphony-on-a-shoestring arrangements are nearly as essential to the E6 sound as their thousand-part harmonies, his work as the Music Tapes has occasionally struggled to distinguish itself from the company he keeps. The group-- Koster, multi-instrumentalist Robbie Cucchiaro, and a rotating cast of E6 regulars-- debuted in 1999 with the maddeningly scattershot <i>1st Imaginary Symphony for Nomad</i>, a particularly dizzying spin on the Elephant 6 house style. Their second official release, 2008's <i>Music Tapes for Clouds and Tornadoes</i>, settled out out some of the earlier stuff's more addled arrangements, drawing on Koster's love of American pastorals. Good as <i>Clouds and Tornadoes</i> was, though, Koster's never quite set himself apart as a songwriter the way some of his good friends and contemporaries have. Unless you're ankle-deep in E6, you probably best know Koster as a utility man, a bit player, ""the dude with the singing saw.""</p>
<p>Running an impressive gamut between stark confessionals and sepia-toned Stephen Foster fantasia, the new <i>Mary's Voice</i> is a grand, genre-straddling vision in sound; on strictly musical terms, it's the most accomplished Music Tapes LP to date. Woozy opener ""The Dark Is Singing Songs (Sleepy Time Down South)"" is a Disneyfied lullaby dirge that seems to arrive about a century past its born-on date. The fairly self-explanatory ""Saw and Calliope Organ on Wire"" follows, an instrumental piece that sounds like the way a yellowed photo of Coney Island looks. This time-travel effect is slightly unsettling, like a letter to your grandmother-- or, perhaps, <a href=""http://www.prefixmag.com/news/original-neutral-milk-hotel-in-the-aeroplane-over-/61576/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the postcard</a> that inspired your favorite record cover-- falling out of an old book. <i>Mary's Voice</i> is interspersed with church bells, ambient whatsits, otherworldly saw interludes, even a brief intermission. Koster's knack for putting sounds together certainly hasn't gone uncommented upon over the years, but here, he's not simply stringing together a few dozen parts. In <i>Mary's Voice</i>'s, he and Cucchiaro have created a eerily beautiful little world unto itself.  </p>
<p>This being an Elephant 6 record, Koster cuts the instrumental rigamarole with a smattering of proper songs along the folk-psych continuum. These tunes are sharply composed, if a bit slippery on subject matter; there's a whole backstory to <i>Mary's Voice</i>, with Mary, something about whales, and the melody of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14109-playing-evening/"" target=""_blank"">""Playing 'Evening'""</a>, but how much any of that actually matters seems to be left up to the listener. Koster's voice isn't what you'd call classically beautiful, but it's sweet, and expressive, and possessed with a solemn optimism that-- when coupled with his fondness for the pump organ-- draws to mind everybody from Daniel Johnston to Phil Elverum. Still, it's Koster's old friend and bandmate Jeff Mangum himself who looms largest over Koster's songwriting this time around. Though Mangum's actual role in <i>Mary's Voice</i> is tough to locate-- he's credited with both ""turntable manipulation"" and ""chair,"" which, well-- there's more than a bit of him in the urgent strums and vocal up-and-over of ""Playing 'Evening'"" and ""To All Who Say Goodnight"" and especially closer ""Takeshi and Elijah"".</p>
<p>Koster's got as much right to claim a Mangum influence as anybody, but here on <i>Mary's Voice</i>, he doesn't so much borrow from Mangum as channel him. You could easily take the stark, deeply felt ""Takeshi"" as a spiritual cousin of sorts to <i>Aeroplane</i>'s astonishing finale, ""Two Headed Boy Pt. 2."": Koster, addressing a seldom-seen friend, talks up their ""musical bands that toured through the land,"" and it hardly even seems a stretch to think the ""sweet, snowy tune"" is Mangum's semen-stained ""Communist Daughter"". ""Takeshi"" is a song of encouragement, acknowledging the past while casting an optimistic eye toward the future. It's not hard to read as a sort of state of the union address for Elephant 6 that feels particularly poignant in the wake of Mangum's recent return to the road and this summer's passing of the Olivia Tremor Control's Bill Doss.  </p>
<p>This time out, the songs themselves are less restless, less prone to distracting themselves, but there are enough hard turns and fidelity shifts between the peculiar orchestrations and Koster's somewhat strangled vocals on the stripped-back songs that the effect can be a bit decentering. Even with the strides he's made as a songwriter in the few years since <i>Clouds and Tornadoes</i>, the more ornately composed stuff here is, ""Takeshi"" aside, more distinctive than the songs themselves. Still, this is an album's album: prismatic, ornate, never wanting for ambition. A song or two here and there might falter a bit, but taken as a whole, <i>Mary's Voice</i> is a minor triumph.</p>
<p>After years of quietly rooting for the guy, I went into <i>Mary's Voice</i> hoping Koster would use the record to find his own. I realize now I'd been looking in the wrong places. Koster plays well with others; that much we've known all along. And he, more than most, has always seemed particularly attuned to the collective goals of E6; this is, after all, the guy who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47588-music-tapes-julian-koster-selling-his-banjo-from-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea-to-fund-circus-tent-tour/"">sold his banjo</a> from the <i>Aeroplane</i> sessions so he and his buddies could go on tour. So if the best moments on <i>Mary's Voice</i> find him surrounded by-- and occasionally channeling-- his old pals, well, that's almost to be expected. Koster's always been quite good at making himself heard, he just happens to be at his loudest when joined in chorus-- real or imaginary-- with his old friends, to lend his talents to something bigger, more communal. You won't find that little logo anywhere on the record, but the detour-prone, profoundly odd, unstuck in time<i> Mary's Voice</i> is an Elephant 6 record through and through. Koster, with a little help from his friends, made this one worth a damn.</p></div>"|16986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16986-marys-voice/|7.1|Paul Thompson

That might not be the most fashionable look (Tejada is, even in electronic music circles, far from a star), but the gamut has served him well creatively, resulting in an impressive nine full-lengths for labels as diverse as Plug Research, his own imprint Palette, and Kompakt over the course of his 14-year arc.</p>
<p>Over that time, Tejada has forged a reputation as a master craftsman, his attention to small sculptural details nicely offsetting his brand of crisp, elegant house. On previous records, such as last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15692-parabolas/"" target=""_blank""><i>Parabolas</i></a>, he restricted himself to a narrow palette of sounds, perhaps as a way to highlight this deftness with detail, but on <i>The Predicting Machine</i>, his second release for Kompakt in as many years, Tejada runs a bit wilder, pulling his sounds from a much deeper catalog of eras, labels, and styles. The end result is a record that feels less like a formal studio exercise and more like something that's as open to the past as it is to the future.</p>
<p>Anyone who spent the early 2000s combing Warp and so many Warp-inspired cottage industry label back catalogs will find lots of familiar sounds here. The sprightly twin bill of ""Glaringly Happy"" and closer ""When All Around Is Madness"" chime with the naive effervescence of the Morr Music era; the undulating ""Radio Channel"" churns on a frosty, ambient loop that wouldn't have sounded out of place on a Biosphere record; and the gently percolating synths from ""Winter Skies"" evoke Plaid at their warmest.</p>
<p>Were <i>The Predicting Machine</i> just a demonstration of Tejada's fluency in those specific dialects of IDM and ambient, it wouldn't be nearly as interesting, but the slightly more retro-leaning aspect of the record is offset nicely by some lustrous, future-facing house. ""An Ounce of Perception"" introduces a limber and vaguely schaffel-inspired rhythm before descending into a gleaming melodic hook; ""Horizon to Horizon"" boasts a wet, elasticated rhythm, and the knowingly titled ""A Familiar Mood"" returns Tejada to the percolating tech house that most people associate him with best. Add it all up, and you get one of Tejada's most varied records to date.</p></div>"|17031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17031-the-predicting-machine/|6.9|Mark Pytlik

Though not quite as moving (or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47727-video-david-byrne-and-st-vincent-who/"">danceable</a>) as ""Child"", ""Who"" was an encouraging sign for the duo's <i>Love This Giant</i> project. St. Vincent's Annie Clark fit well amidst a few of Byrne's favorite tricks: lyrics doubling as a series of philosophical questions, a croony curiosity about the wider world, and an arrangement loaded with the brazen brass blurts (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8912-david-byrne-and-st-vincent/"">Clark's idea, actually</a>) that Byrne first fell for via his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10870-the-knee-plays/""><span class=""s1""><i>Knee Plays</i></span></a> album. A few months later, ""Who"" opens the duo's full-length album, which falls short of both the single's early promise, and the on-paper perfection of the pairing.</p>
<p>You could argue that David Byrne and Annie Clark collaborating on an album in 2012 is better framed by the question immediately asked of any such high-profile pairing: ""Why?"" On the surface, the two have quite a few commonalities. Both Byrne and Clark are equally fascinated by the theatricality of everyday life: the scripts and performances that drive our days and raise the stakes of our mundane interactions to the level of high drama or (for this duo) dark comedy. Both performers are known for their thousand-yard stares (compare the covers of Byrne's <i><a href=""http://constructive9.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/david-byrne-feelings-albumcoverproject-com.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Feelings</a></i> with St. Vincent's <i><a href=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RkU6BtKIL._SL500_AA300_.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Actor</a></i>) that suggest a quiet intensity merged with a playful approach to self-presentation.</p>
<p>More generally, much of the power of Clark's and Byrne's music relies on the tension between being trapped and letting go. The primary narrative arc of Talking Heads' legendary live concert <i>Stop Making Sense </i>sees the reluctantly public shut-in character of the jittery ""Psycho Killer"" gradually learn to embrace his eccentricities, leading to the effusive gospel of closer ""Take Me to the River"". In her five-plus years as St. Vincent, Annie Clark has set and broken pre-determined molds from every conceivable direction-- at her best, she can go from ""Psycho Killer"" to ""River"" in a single song. It makes sense, then, that much of <i>Love This Giant</i> is taken with the idea of human transformation, as evidenced by the album's prosthetically-enhanced cover art. On ""The One Who Broke Your Heart"", we hear of ""the beautiful people"" who ""did some work on your face."" Clark sings of the hopeful revelations of a gradual thawing process on ""Ice Age"". On ""I Am an Ape"", Byrne playfully reverse-engineers evolution.</p>
<p>But at the same time, collaborations aren't always as simple as pairing two smart artists cut from the same cloth. Because they're so taken with the idiosyncrasies of others' behaviors and interactions, Byrne and Clark constantly run the risk of their music tipping over into obsessiveness, of living up to the lifeless caricatures they're ostensibly picking apart. Especially considering the expectations attending a project created by two kindred spirits with ideas and talent to spare, <i>Love This Giant</i> is a disappointment. With precious few exceptions, neither Clark nor Byrne seems willing to push the other into new musical territory that might contain revelations about either. The songs merely stand apart from life and dryly comment on its strangeness, while the arrangements-- most prominently featuring the work of several conservatory-level brass players-- are suffused with the sterility that always threatens long-distance collaborations.</p>
<p>""Dinner for Two"" is representative in this regard. The narrator spends the song contemplating the sad fact that he's never able to enjoy a quiet, intimate time with his lover, because both are too busy with such nuisances as dinner parties with possibly famous authors milling about. The song's arid brass arrangement and bland percussion do it no favors (elsewhere on the album, John Congleton handles drum programming duties, and seems intent on dragging the music kicking and screaming into 2001). Later, there's ""I Should Watch TV"", which whooshes Byrne right past the clever engagement with popular culture that made a song like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4uqBkiVV5A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Found a Job""</a> such a quirky joy, and plops him straight into a self-important deconstruction of his own silly impulses. He's admitting that he <i>really should</i> watch more TV, because it would offer him insight into the minds of the nameless bodies he sees moving around himself everyday. But he resists, and instead sets off quoting Whitman's ""Song of Myself"" as if to convince himself of his own uniqueness.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As for St. Vincent, it's hard to imagine too many people discovering her through this collaboration, but either way, she's responsible for <i>Giant</i>'s best moments. In her own way, she's downright soulful on the refrains of ""Weekend in the Dust"", a style that serves as a compelling counterpoint to the icy, aristocratic lilt she inhabits on the verses. Though ""Ice Age"" may not count among the highlights of <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12985-actor/""><span class=""s1""><i>Actor</i></span></a> or <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15813-strange-mercy/""><span class=""s1""><i>Strange Mercy</i></span></a>, it shows Clark's skill at shifting gears mid-song without disturbing the cargo, and at employing elements strategically-- here, <i>Giant'</i>s omnipresent (and stiflingly monochromatic) brass is mostly reduced to subtle color and minimalist chorus additions, until blooming during the song's well-earned coda. It's not exactly high praise, I know: Here are the two best songs on a strange flop of a high-profile collaboration. In retrospect, it seems <i>Giant</i> will function less as a career highpoint for either artist, and more as a historical marker of the career trajectories of each participant. Byrne plays the wandering dilettante, content to transform his old ideas anew, while Clark upstages her mentor, convinced she still has a lot more to prove.</p></div>"|17026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17026-love-this-giant/|5.9|Eric Harvey

The former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2538-love-as-laughter/"" target=""_blank"">Love as Laughter</a> bassist, now a Brooklyn record store owner, operates within a subgenre-- post-punk folk-- that, if not treated carefully, can conjure thoughts of open-mic aspirants murdering Pogues songs at campus pubs or, worse, <a href=""http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/drawing-swastikas-on-shit-odd-future-iceage-and-cult-of-youth/Content?oid=4416038"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">get you labeled a fascist</a>. And even if you disregard its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_Youth"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fatherland intimations</a>, Ragon's adopted <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cultofyouth"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cult of Youth</a> moniker still holds him to an exceptionally high standard of passion and messianic fervor, with the expectation that there's a congregation of impressionable souls out there waiting to heed his call.</p>
<p>That scenario seemed rather unlikely when Ragon first debuted Cult of Youth in 2007 as a solo project that emphasized the contrast between the gnashed-teeth aggression of his vocals and the stripped-down acoustic strums underpinning them. In the wrong hands, folk-punk can feel like the musical equivalent of bringing a knife to a gunfight. But Ragon has avoided this pitfall by recruiting a proper backing band-- including drummer Glenn Maryansky and Zola Jesus' go-to violinist Christiana Key-- and putting their individual skills to excellent use, transforming Cult of Youth from one man's caustic catharsis into something increasingly inviting and alluring, while still retaining the fire and ire that initially fuelled the enterprise.</p>
<p>You can hear that transformation happen in real time on <i>Love Will Prevail</i>'s ""Garden of Delights"". It intensifies over the course of eight verses-- each more grueling and despairingly world-weary than the one before-- before yielding to its first and only chorus, a defiant, optimistic affirmation of the new album's title. This a shift that exemplifies <i>Love Will Prevail</i>'s open-hearted, wide-screened splendor: While it's safe to assume that Ragon will be buried with his acoustic guitar, the band's sound is greatly amplified by foregrounding Key's furious fiddle-playing, Maryansky's rollicking rhythms, subtle electric-guitar textures, and majestic swirls of brass-- reminiscent of Robert Wyatt's 1974 masterpiece, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14797-rock-bottom-ruth-is-stranger-than-richard-nothing-can-stop-us-old-rottenhat-dondestan-revisited/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rock Bottom</i></a>-- that lend <i>Love Will Prevail</i> a spacious, otherworldly feel, without ever acquiring the NPR-tasteful sheen of so many other indie folkestras. And if Ragon's bottom-of-the-well bellow will remain a barrier to entry for some, it's put to far more benevolent use here: the band's expanded palette is matched by a greater penchant for brisk, accessible hooks-- from the anthemic ascent of opener ""Man and Man's Ruin"" to the scrappy charm of closer ""It Took a Lifetime""-- and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v1tyDAmETk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brix Smith-like interplay</a> with guest vocalist Beverly Hames that forge a greater aesthetic distance between Cult of Youth and their post-industrial progenitors. (That said, ""Path of Total Freedom"" confirms Ragon is still a sucker for Celtic-punk jiggery; fortunately, this regression only lasts for 70 seconds.)</p>
<p>As ever, Ragon's lyrics are highly evocative if not outright provocative; those looking for a more sinister intent to Cult of Youth's M.O. may find what they're looking for in a surface reading of mid-album double shot ""A New Way"" and ""New Old Ways"", whose titles bring to mind <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">another band that had a lot to answer for</a>. But the mood is ultimately one of liberation and celebration: the former is an arms-swaying shanty that only grows more exuberant as it gets swallowed up by an encroaching wave of distortion; the latter rides its hypno-chant chorus into a heady dub-jazz outro that you wish they'd play out forever. (And, if anything, proclamations such as ""There's a war abroad that cannot be won/ There's a war at home that has just begun"" and the call for ""forward thinking in a backwards time"" make most sense as critiques of post-Dubya Republicanism.) Even theatrically bloodthirsty moments like the busker-Bad-Seeds rager ""To Lay With the Wolves"" reinforce the idea that this album's title is not ironic: After a stormy three-minute build, the song simmers down with Ragon proudly admitting, ""I fell in love/ In love with the world/ Because that's when it hit me/ That all was right/ Yes, that's when it hit me/ That the future was bright."" It's hard to decode whether Ragon's talking about the future of America or just that of his own band; at the very least, <i>Love Will Prevail</i> gives you ample reason to believe in the latter.</p></div></div>"|16987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16987-love-will-prevail/|8.0|Stuart Berman

On tour for 2004's so-so <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3805-love-and-distance/"" target=""_blank""><i>Love and Distance</i></a>, the Portland widescreeners' Brandon Summers lost his voice, a rather unfortunate affliction for the vocalist of an indie rock band trying to make a go of it. Rather than pack it in, Summers went out, got healthy, and found himself a vocal coach to put him through the paces. It worked: 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11390-keep-your-eyes-ahead/"" target=""_blank""><i>Keep Your Eyes Ahead</i></a> found Summers doing the best singing of his life, trading up from the oft-strained delivery of his earlier work for a newfound confidence and clarity. And the music followed, trading up from their middle-of-the-pack post-Beta Band synth-pop tinkering to something several shades bolder and more rousing. ""The long and fulfilling trajectory"" our Andrew Gaerig predicted would follow <i>Keep Your Eyes Ahead</i> continues apace with <i>Negotiations</i>, their fifth LP. As Summers continues to settle into his new voice, the music that surrounds it has grown ever-grander to match.</p>
<p><i>Negotiations</i>, like <i>Keep Your Eyes Ahead</i> before it, is just a big record, its towering choruses and wide-open spaces making for plenty of high drama. But it's a graceful, reserved sort of grandiosity: <i>Negotiations</i>' melodies are shapely, its tone autumnal, its playing confident and unshowy. With its elliptical song-structures and pristine production, <i>Negotiations</i> neatly sidesteps much of the excess (both sonic and emotional) associated with pop on this scale; it's rare that Summers and multi-instrumentalist Ben Weikel sound like a duo, exactly, but time and again they know just when to quit piling it on. They're as good with the more muted mid-tempo stuff as they are with blood-pumping uplift; Summers' wine-drunk Dylan routine, passable at best, made up most of <i>Keep Your Eyes Ahead</i>'s weaker moments, but the dusky ""Harvester of Souls"" and the twinkling makeout synths of ""Silence on Silence"" prove they're as deft with a ballad as they are with anything bigger. Hints of psych and prog color the margins here, but by and large, <i>Negotiatons</i> takes the romantic sweep of 1980s arena-pop and plays it with the relative emotional reserve and compositional trickiness of turn-of-the-millenium Pacific Northwest indie. Sidestepping go-for-broke bombast and easy melodrama, Summers and Weikel lean into <i>Negotiations</i>' curves, making their every move count.</p>
<p>Behind the mic, Summers knows both when to go for broke and when to pull it back. His pie-eyed delivery conjures everybody from the Walkmen's Ham Leithauser minus a couple of fingers of scotch to the Killers' frontman Brandon Flowers scrubbed of a few layers of schmaltz, but his slightly jazzy, behind-the-beat delivery and refusal to bug his eyes out in search of the big note leaves things sounding rich, inviting, and with just the right amount of emotional heft. Summers' new voice isn't that of a young man, and he brings some of that maturity to <i>Negotiations</i>' smoldering affairs of the heart. <i>Negotiations</i>' first line-- ""Hey now, draw yourself more near to me""-- quickly brings you in close, but much of the rest of the record operates at a slight distance. Makes sense, really: you've gotta step back a little ways just to take it all in. The ""insurance claims, the one night stands, and sad refrains"" Summers sings of on <i>Negotiations</i> seem to speak to a very adult sort of drama, but he's not always big on particulars, which makes most of <i>Negotiations</i>' lyrics the kind you've got to put yourself into to get much out of. There's a lot of half-lovelorn, half-triumphant stuff about shadows falling and open letters and the like, which can feel like awfully broad strokes; the music, too, with its spacious chords, aqueous synths, and deliberate pacing, sometimes suggests more than it's willing to offer outright.</p>
<p><i>Negotiations</i>' relative lack of beat-you-over-the-head bluster is commendable, but if there's any knock against the record, it's its reticence to go all out, even just the once. Rather than shooting for the stratosphere like, say, <i>Keep Your Eyes Ahead</i>'s infectious title track, the songs on<i> Negotiations</i> tend to take a more circuitous path, allowing for both more space and more sinew in the arrangements. Sure, you'll find something to latch onto in every song, but you won't always walk away from <i>Negotiations</i> with its choruses in your head; it's a more consistent record than its predecessor, but more orderly, too, and the highs just aren't quite as high. <i>Negotiations</i> takes a little time to get your head around, its charms more subtle-- and more rewarding-- than they seem on first pass. Much the same could be said of the Helio Sequence itself, a band that's really only come into its own over these last two records. Nowadays, it's not such a rare thing for a band to get something of a second act, but it's the rare band that seems to know what to do with it. What the Helio Sequence got was less a reboot than a new lease on life. But whatever's gotten into the Helio Sequence over the last few years, their persistence is continuing to pay off.</p></div>"|17024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17024-negotiations/|6.8|Paul Thompson

Its expanded stylistic scope makes a statement in itself: If you want to fight against the idea that downtempo slow jams are soporific garbage, it's a savvy move to string together examples from every corner imaginable-- radio-ready R&amp;B, fusion jazz, IDM, indie pop, MOR, folk, ambient, new age-- and pull off at least a moderately unpredictable dynamic by trading genre for mood. Split the difference between all these styles, and in the best case scenario, the compilation curators come up with their own new thing entirely.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The worst-case scenario, meanwhile, mostly involves a lot of weird juxtaposition for its own sake. And while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7244-metronomy/"" target=""_blank"">Metronomy</a>'s entry into the Late Night Tales series isn't necessarily the worst case of anything, it is one of those mixes where half the entertainment value seems reliant on poking at clashing sensibilities. Joe Mount and co. have spent their three-album career toying with styles and then jumping off to the next thing, and the tracklist on this collection clearly comes from the library of someone who knows the value of being adventurous without losing sight of what makes for decent pop. Building a bridge from Tweet to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12517-chick-corea"" target=""_blank"">Chick Corea</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">Autechre</a> to the Alan Parsons Project is one of those egalitarian-in-theory notions that comes from the noble idea of trying to make the avant and the accessible at least shake hands for a bit, and when it's pulled off well, notions of so-called clashing sensibilities feel mercifully irrelevant.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's a brilliant choice to lead things off with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"" target=""_blank"">OutKast</a>'s underrated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11796-speakerboxxxthe-love-below/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Love Below </i></a>deep cut ""Prototype"", the swoony psychedelic soul that emerged when André 3000 tried taking his own slice from D'Angelo's <i>Voodoo</i>. And the transition into Tweet's ""Drunk"", an overlooked piece of headswimming, loneliness-wrecked heartbreak from <i>Southern Hummingbird</i>, makes this the beginning of what, in another context, could have been an amazing dedication to the more introspective and intensely slow-burning moments of early-00s R&amp;B. But then the scene starts to shift-- subtly at first, from there into soul-jazz and fusion (Sa-Ra Creative Partners' ""Cosmic Ball""; Chick Corea's ""El Bozo, Part 1""), then into a pile-up of indie rap (Dr. Octagon), 80s electro-soul (World Class Wreckin' Cru), 70s soft rock (the Alessi Brothers), IDM (Autechre)-- and soon enough, the pieces stop actually fitting together.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The problem is that it's not enough to just get things to sound good together-- they have to <i>feel </i>good together, too. And as a tone-setting exploration of anything deeper than a record collection, this mix doesn't really make that much sense. The transitions can be jarring on a pure sonic level; the segue from ""Drunk"" to Sa-Ra's ""Cosmic Ball"" tries to bridge minimalist R&amp;B with  space-jazz, and the way their respective drum sounds try to shove each other aside has the same feeling of an elevator suddenly jostling between floors. Other juxtapositions are so jarring that it almost seems like they're trying to spin some snarky punchlines. If you somehow find a way to sink your way in to the jokey neo-electro of Geneva Jacuzzi's ""Love Caboose"" and get on its arch-to-a-fault wavelength, getting shoved from there to Two Lone Swordsmen's hopped-up Kraut-punk workout ""You Are..."" is a rude way to knock you out of the loop. I wasn't kidding about the Alessi Brothers-Autechre transition, either; the segue from the twee AM pop of ""Seabird"" into the seasick glitch of ""Fold 4, Wrap 5"" might have good intentions, but it still sounds like the kind of pairing that cancels out both songs' traits entirely. And as wide as the scope of downtempo tracks can be, it fails to set any cohesive mood; it goes from romantic to lonely to cosmic to quirky to unnerving all in its first five selections and never manages to recoup any sense of consistent purpose.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Metronomy's Late Night Tales entry might work a bit better as a showcase of influence, but not much better. Any collection that includes something from early-70s synthesizer super-workshop Tonto's Expanding Head Band (""Cybernaut"") and the talkbox-goes-country innovation of steel guitarist Pete Drake (""Forever"") at least has novelty on its side. But whatever influence that stuff might have on Metronomy themselves isn't all that present in a new track of theirs that's included here, ""Hypnose"", a slow trudge of vaguely Bernard Fevre-esque codeine disco that sounds about as innovative and personality-rich as your typical circa-1979 production library music LP. Songs like that shouldn't feel like less than the sum of their parts. Neither should mixes.</p></div>"|16989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16989-latenighttales/|5.8|Nate Patrin

In the past, they've circulated through networks of diehard fans and avid tape traders, apart from the regular distribution avenues of the record industry. Through a particularly good or bad version of a familiar song, an odd cover in the setlist, or a burst of rambling stage banter, they not only can act as a kind of unofficial currency between fans but can offer a very different and potentially unguarded glimpse of an artist in his or her true setting. Now that anyone with an internet connection can download <i>The Complete Basement Tapes </i>or <i>The Boss of E Street</i>, the traditional equation of rarity with value is beginning to break apart. By titling his first live album <i>Bootlegs</i>, the Norwegian singer-songwriter <a href=""http://www.sondrelerche.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sondre Lerche</a> is making an obvious nod to this medium in pop history, which is appropriate considering his acknowledged debts to Paul Simon, Burt Bacharach, and latter-day Elvis Costello. He definitely seems like the kind of guy who has assembled his own personal version of <i>SMiLE</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Bootlegs </i>as a title also signals an aesthetic choice: Rather than scrub the recordings of wrong notes, stage banter, and audience chatter, Lerche has decided to leave the rough edges in, as if to hint at-- but not indulge in-- the shitty sound quality of a bootleg. First of all, he recorded most of these tracks in Bergen, Norway, ensuring a hometown audience's excitement for a local boy done good. They are a vocal crowd, and at times it's difficult to tell who's more juiced: the artist playing ""Two Way Monologue"" or the audience hearing it. The only downside is that too often the fans persuade you more of the music's quality than the actual music does. Even when the momentum flags, the crowd rarely does.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Perhaps more crucially, these recordings were made on just two tracks instead of four or more. One captures the thrum of the room, the other the noise made by the band, with outsize prominence granted to the drums and especially the high hat. That rhythm-first presentation adds a sense of immediacy to ""Domino"" and ""Airport Taxi Reception"", not only presenting Lerche's band as a dynamic unit but also drawing a clear line between performers and listeners. It's perhaps most effective on ""Private Caller"", which descends into the kind of rock din that Lerche's studio albums too rarely allow. Oddly, it doesn't work quite so well on closer ""Modern Nature"", when it's mostly just Lerche and his guitar, and it's apparent just how hard he's grasping to be clever.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Bootlegs</i> doesn't actually sound truly raw, but it does sound raw-ish. In the case of this particular artist, that's more than enough to lend these songs new life and new urgency compared to their studio iterations. Throughout his 20s-- this release marks his 30th birthday-- Lerche has shown a tendency toward crippling professionalism; his albums sound too slick, too clever by half, too consummate. His songs have been so finely crafted that they're nearly squeezed dry of personality, delivering in a voice that careens upward into a grainless and therefore indistinct falsetto. The discrepancy on <i>Bootlegs</i> between studious songcraft and rambunctious execution occasionally sounds distractingly self-conscious, but Lerche still sounds better here for sounding so unguarded and loose. It's like watching your uptight friend get shitfaced. Lerche slurs his delivery at the beginning of ""Sleep on Needles"", emphasizing the warbled vowels and hissing his ""s""s; then the band comes in and makes good on the unhinged intro, hitting much harder than we've come to expect. </p>

Several currents of music flowed into the work of this London band to create something that felt strangely new. Singers Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim treated the pop song like a whispered secret, an achingly intimate exchange best understood in the general vicinity of a bed. And the xx foregrounded the hushed voices by process of subtraction, creating music with a daring sense of space. Under the production direction of third member Jamie Smith (now known as Jamie xx), the xx created a sound world where the simplest chord change was freighted with emotion. <i>xx</i>'s minimal production reacquainted listeners with the expressive possibility of the guitar. Croft's gently picked lines, ultra clean with a tasteful mist of reverb, were quietly devastating in their own way, connecting the music with indie rock proper. The final piece of the puzzle was Jamie xx's careful beat programming, which was aware of up-to-the-moment trends in UK bass music but never pandered to them. These parts came together in a debut that sounded great at the time and has become a landmark. Channeling the spirit if not the precise sound of the softer and more cerebral end of R&amp;B (Sade Adu is the spirit mother, Aaliyah the holy ghost) and mixing it with a pinch of DIY guitar music and a smart underpinning of rhythm, the xx created music rich with possibility. And while they didn't change the way music was made, they did have an effect on how it was heard. Without them, we'd be coming at music by artists like the Weeknd and Jessie Ware with different ears.</p>
<p>But you knew what was coming with album number two: Where do you go next? Do you light out for new territory or refine what's already there? The xx have chosen the latter tack, if you consider further stripping of their already-naked sound a refinement. <i>Coexist</i> takes the most distinctive things about the xx-- ""shh"" vocals, guitar patterns that feel like faint line drawings, lyrics that detail the most essential aspects of yearning-- and eliminates virtually everything else. It didn't seem possible that the arrangements on the debut could stand to have even more taken from them, but that's what's happened here. In that regard, the album feels in its own way brave. They're doubling down on what makes them stand out, which brings with it the real possibility of self-parody. Fortunately, the xx aren't at that point yet. So the most appealing thing about this record is that this band, having created a brilliant and moving sound, returns to it again for another 38 minutes. ""Angels"" drips with austere beauty, ""Tides"" begins a duet so stark it's breathtaking, the evocative piano in ""Swept Away"" is a nice wrinkle. This is still gorgeous stuff, and it's hard not to enjoy it while it's on. But while the edifice of their aesthetic still stands, in a few places it's getting a little rickety.</p>
<p>If generally successful on its own terms, <i>Coexist</i> also serves to remind us why exactly the debut was so brilliant. For one, <i>xx</i> had a very subtle and effective sense of dynamics. I'm thinking in particular of songs such as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PElhV8z7I60"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Islands""</a>, with its halting beat that mapped the push-pull production of Timbaland onto an indie pop context. There are no such moments on <i>Coexist</i>, an album that moves from one song to the next like a slow-rolling fog. You can't help but wish Jamie xx had experimented a bit more and borrowed ideas hatched from his creative run of production work since the debut. With his remixes, DJ sets, mixes, and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42725-listen-jamie-xxs-new-single/"" target=""_blank"">brilliant single</a>, he's proven to be one of the more adventurous and open-minded young producers going, hungry to incorporate all kinds of sounds and approaches into his music. The only real evidence of those explorations here is the steel drum that pops up on ""Reunion"", which brings to mind his use of the instrument in his single ""Far Nearer"" and gives <i>Coexist</i> a rare crack of light. There's no reason why the xx <i>have</i> to try something new sonically. But bands with a unique signature generally stick around by growing as songwriters and staying open to the possibilities of production. <i>Coexist</i> shows no such growth. With the music so focused and constrained, the album becomes slightly claustrophobic; where the first made you think about the different sounds that came from outside, this feels closed off.</p>
<p>In terms of lyrics, the xx have done away with specificity and chosen to focus on the travails of relationships using the broadest possible language. If I were to say, ""You know the song that mentions a look in a lover's eyes?"" you'd say, ""Which one?"" because some variation of the phrase pops up repeatedly. <i>I see it in your eyes... the feeling in my heart... something has changed...the feeling goes on... never again... </i>A handful of images and thoughts are shuffled like a deck of cards and doled out, seemingly at random. And while Croft or Sim don't need to get near Frank Ocean's level of sophistication for their music to work, with music so minimal, I find myself yearning for a line as pedestrian and relatable as ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI2eO_mNM88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We watch things on VCRs</a>."" Too often, these words feel like placeholders.</p>
<p>Shortcomings aside, I find myself enjoying <i>Coexist</i> and returning to it. It's hard not to be disappointed given what came before, but the xx are still a special band, and time could possibly be kinder to their second LP as its place within a longer career comes into focus. For now, they've earned the right to make this record. Every band that creates a new world deserves a chance to return to it, to play around some more and see how much inspiration still exists. Asking for a third shot at it, on the other hand, is generally a harder sell.</p></div></div>"|17022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17022-coexist/|7.5|Mark Richardson

On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12444-dedication-3/"" target=""_blank""><i>3</i></a>, he was skidding dangerously post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11608-tha-carter-iii/"" target=""_blank""><i>Carter III</i></a>, whacked out on codeine and sounding frayed.<i> Dedication 4</i>, for its part, is the clearest transmission yet of a message he's been sending for a while: He'd rather not to be rapping anymore. From a beat selection so obvious that the word ""selection"" feels generous to Wayne's recycled punch lines to his unimaginative rhyme patterns, the mixtape is joyless clock-punching work from a rapper who has given some indications he <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1692349/lil-wayne-2-chainz-yuck-verse.jhtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">doesn't even like his own music as much anymore</a>. But a career's a career, and when you've gotten this famous, you don't just stop, even if maybe you'd prefer to. This is the spirit <i>Dedication 4</i> comes to us in: Somehow, I don't think this is what 2005 Wayne meant when he promised us he'd <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVsHZo8BIow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">only retire when he died</a>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Not many rappers bother with this format anymore, in which a rapper flexes skill over a tape full of borrowed beats to point out how much better they are than the rappers that paid for them. Nonetheless, this is the sort of mixtape that elevated Wayne from ""famous rapper"" to ""legendary rapper."" His freestyles over beats like ""Show Me What You Got"" and ""Shoulder Lean"" have become classics on their own. By contrast, <i>Dedication 4</i> is a game of rap karaoke. The beats he raps over-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0Y39QnwRvY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Same Damn Tune""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSpwoEtMkbA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Burn""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1McUNtiF0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mercy""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1JJkMD1hE4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Like""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr-Lj9TnJOE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Amen""</a>-- are so ubiquitous that every rapper in the world looking for a quick SEO boost has spit some bars over them. Worse, Wayne falls immediately into the song's preexisting rhyme pattern, offering nothing to distract you from its source material: For a rapper so famous for stealing-- and murdering-- beats, the worst I can say about <i>Dedication 4</i> is that there isn't one moment where I wouldn't rather be listening to the often mediocre originals.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are a dozen or so good punch lines scattered on <i>D4</i>, enough to make it fun enough for one listen: a good ""Jack Black/Jack White"" joke on ""Magic"", a ""straitjacket/straight jack it"" pun on ""Burn"". On ""Cashed Out"", he neatly unites his well-documented Gremlins fixation to his sex fixation with the line, ""That pussy so wet, it turned into a Gremlin."" Wayne doesn't sound depressed or detached here; he's still having fun, collapsing into giggles after dropping the Larry-the-Cable-Guy-worthy ""I would talk about my dick/ But that shit would be a long story."" He just sounds uninspired, and in need of a new style.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are two surprising moments on <i>Dedication 4:</i> One is Nicki Minaj's hilarious faux-Romney endorsement on ""Mercy"" (if Minaj were actually to offer a Romney endorsement, I don't think the straight-faced line, ""I'm a Republican, voting for Mitt Romney,"" on a Lil Wayne mixtape would be her method). The other is when G Dep's ""Special Delivery"", of all things, shows up late on the mixtape. ""I don't even like this beat,"" Wayne mumbles playfully, before slipping in one of the tape's liveliest verses, dancing in and out of double time. It's one of the only verses that doesn't feel like a minimally tweaked update on something he said in 2007. Wayne has <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/lil-wayne--2/65321"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admitted lately</a> that he's bored with rapping, reasonably pointing out, ""I've been doing it since I was eight and I'm about to be 30 in September... I think fans deserve a little-to-no Wayne. I've been everywhere."" He's right. Let's hope <i>Dedication 4</i> is the last we hear from Wayne for a while: We can wait until he has something to say before he approaches a mic again. </p></div>"|17159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17159-dedication-4/|5.0|Jayson Greene

On  their latest album, <i>For My Parents</i>, there isn't much juice remaining in it: You can anticipate every single dynamic shift in its five compositions, which is not typically an asset for instrumental music meant to take you on an emotional journey. There isn't much of a journey to be taken on <i>For My Parents</i>; the music doesn't develop, darken, or tell a story so much as it expands and deflates like a balloon. Trying to engage actively with it, to search its contours with your mind, is like poking a soap bubble.</p>
<p>As they did on their live album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14272-holy-ground-nyc-live-with-the-wordless-music-orchestra/"" target=""_blank""><i>Holy Ground</i></a>, they enlist the Wordless Music Orchestra to back them, and the added heft of their strings makes the bombast even harder to take seriously: This is music destined for helicopter-panning shots of majestic rainforest canopies, close-ups of dewy-eyed Olympic athletes, and little else. They also stepped out from Steve Albini's production to enlist producer Henry Hirsch, who gathered the band and the orchestra in his cavernous cathedral space, Waterfront Studios, where every kettle-drum thump and overdriven guitar could resound into the heavens. The album sounds beautiful, in the way that Peter Jackson's visions of heaven in his critically reviled adaptation of <i>The Lovely Bones</i> looked beautiful: picture-book simple but vivid and clear.</p>
<p>The Wordless Music strings play their melodies with a nice arm-twisting dab of schmaltz, which is necessary when you are navigating the <i>Mr. Holland's Opus</i>-caliber key modulations in the finale of ""Legend"". They manage to make a simple rising major scale on ""Legend"" feel like dawning rays of morning sunshine. It's an uphill struggle, though, to claim real pathos from such transparently cheesy material: The guitar melody for ""Nostalgia"" directly plagiarizes some Suzuki Violin School tune-scrap my memory is still struggling to place from my childhood years in group classes. The melody to ""Unseen Harbor"" has a similar children's-exercise obviousness to its progression. It's hard to turn a nursery rhyme into Tchaikovsky.</p>
<p>Mono's music is better used than listened to actively. As a vigorously marked road map to emotional catharsis, I can imagine it being helpful: If I were, say, doing a particularly tough yoga class, I'm sure that cueing up ""Dream Odyssey"" at the right moment would help me sink more deeply, more meaningfully, into my Warrior Two. Other music functions this way, creating a space for you to have your own thoughts more than it bothers to have its own. But you can't exactly sink into a soothing bubble bath while Mono plays, either, as every piece works its way into a thundering, Trans-Siberian Orchestra climax that would have me scrambling out of the tub for the volume button.</p>
<p>The garish maximalism would be fine if the pieces did more to distinguish themselves from each other. Or if they were truly <i>exciting</i>. But <i>For My Parents</i> suffers, somehow, from both tastefulness and tastelessness: Too mushy and indistinguishable to wallop you in the gut and too cheesy to be taken seriously, the album feels, at its worst, like a series of power ballads with the choruses ripped out. If they really want to make the post-rock equivalent of a Michael Bay film-- try a dirtier distortion pedal, for instance, or bring in the brass or better yet, a big heavy gong-- I'm there. But that kind of awesome would likely entail risking more genuine awfulness than Mono probably have in them.</p></div>"|16985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16985-for-my-parents/|5.4|Jayson Greene

Death is there in the first song, there in the last, and wheedling all in between. The brothers, actual and nominal, aren't the raggedy kids they were when they started out a decade ago; they've married, started families, settled down. The band's last record, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13478-i-and-love-and-you/"" target=""_blank""><i>I and Love and You</i></a>, offered a tamer version of Seth and Scott Avett's splintered yawps and shredded banjo strings, and their live show has tempered as their catalog has filled out and fanbase expanded from regional devotees to national masses. It's tempting to peg the Avetts' story as one of a little-band-that-could selling out and smoothing over when a major label and bigger stages come calling, but I'm not sure it's that simple; for an act in it for the long haul, a certain rounding of the edges seems not only inevitable, but natural-- healthy, even. Growing up is hard to do, but outright refusing can be trickier.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Either way, as the Avetts know, it all shakes out the same in the end. This record, the band's second for Rick Rubin's American Recordings, is hardly the first time their eyes have focused on that far, dark horizon. Among all the rough-and-tumble soul-searching and skirt-chasing of their five previous releases there's been a steady procession of nods toward the dying of the light: ""The Lowering"", from 2006's <i>Four Thieves Gone</i>, remains the most gutting; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10778-emotionalism/"" target=""_blank""><i>Emotionalism</i></a>'s ""Die Die Die""-- which renders death a taunting, stomp-along chorus-- still the most fun.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But <i>The Carpenter</i> offers something different. In its most lucid moments, at least, it grapples with something perhaps more unfathomable than dying-- not being old, but <i>growing</i> old. ""Things change and get strange with the movement of time/ It's happening right now to you,"" Scott drawls on ""Down with the Shine"", the rhapsodic choruses smudged with bleary, boozy horns. There's a vast swath between shaking a fist at death and finally meeting its hand; meanwhile, calendar pages turn, diesel engines pull us along, babies are born. ""A Father's First Spring"" could fall into the treacle-trap its title suggests but avoids it thanks to one of the band's finest songwriting efforts in some time. ""I have been homesick to you since we met,"" Scott sings of and to his own little girl, countering the sweetness with the sudden abject terror of new fatherhood: ""The realest thing I ever felt/ Was the blood on the floor and the love in your yell/ I was a child before the day that I met Eleanor."" Under the verses, guitar lines tease and knit into one another; on the chorus, Benmont Tench's organ wells and whirrs like an overfull heart. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Too many of the other songs feel starved of that love, though. The title track, which opens the album, suffers from major tonal whiplash, the chillingly oblique line, ""when the black dress drags upon the ground, I'll be ready to surrender,"" bafflingly abutted with the rancid cliche of ""we're all in this together."" The maudlin ""Winter in my Heart"" is colorless despite the verses' insistence upon listing color after color, the mopey strums and mews of ""I don't know what the reasons are"" so effectively calling to mind that antidepressant ad with the morose bouncing ball that Zoloft should cut the band a check. ""I Never Knew You"" tries to slip into a loose-armed barroom vibe but veers into weird sock-hop territory before it gets the chance, plagued all the while by an needling, petty bitterness that would've been out of place even on the band's freshman efforts. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The most notable travesty here-- and I do believe it is a travesty-- is ""Paul Newman vs. the Demons"", which Scott Avett this summer told <i>Rolling Stone</i> was meant to harken back to the Avett Brothers' earlier incarnation as ""a loud band"" with an affection for Soundgarden, but which only proves they were wise to avert course in the first place. Heaped upon the gunky, puffed-up electric guitars and drum thrashings and hernia-busting vocals are lyrics referencing the movie star's eponymous line of organic, all-proceeds-to-charity wine. ""Oh, to be like him and walk a path / To lend a hand, do something worth a damn,"" the brothers sing. In all honesty, if these guys want to slap their name on some preservative-free snacks-- Avett-O's, maybe?-- I'll leave Publix with a box or two. But I'd rather reenact the egg-eating scene from <i>Cool Hand Luke </i>with a jar of Sockarooni sauce for dipping than listen to this song ever again.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Track for track, the Avetts' best release might be 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12054-the-second-gleam-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Second Gleam</i></a>, a spry, six-song EP; <i>The Carpenter</i>, winnowed down to its best efforts, would seem of a piece. This may be the real tragedy of the band's signing to Rubin's American imprint, which was recently shuffled from Sony to Universal Republic: the need to justify the major-label investment with full LPs rather than the inbetweeny projects allowed for by Ramseur Records, the band's longtime independent home. Rubin may be a wizard in the studio, but his involvement has fostered a truly remarkable level of bloat in this once bare-boned, focused band. But who knows? Maybe this is all exactly what they want. And if it is, who can blame them for getting it? Life is too short, and too long, for anything else.</p></div>"|17186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17186-the-avett-brothers-the-carpenter/|6.5|Rachael Maddux

Just joking; they are joking. That seemed to be the takeaway of their debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15406-what-did-you-expect-from-the-vaccines/"" target=""_blank"">What Did You Expect From the Vaccines?</a></i>,<i> </i>the title of which wisely tried to curry favor with the listener by shifting the focus from the unyieldingly competent lad-rock within to what the Vaccines wanted to be seen as their utter lack of complicity in being swept up by perfunctory hype. Maybe they had a point: Even if they were heralded by NME as the ""Return of the Great British Guitar Band,"" their relationship with the press seemed like less a torrid love affair than a blind date based on type (""you two will <i>so </i>get along"").</p>
<p>A year later, it's not surprising that <i>Come of Age </i>is pulling all the same tricks both musically and philosophically. On leadoff track ""No Hope"", Justin Young sings, ""I don't really care about anybody else/ When I haven't got my own life figured out,"" and it's clear that the title points to a reprise of the debut's self-reflexive copouts. On <i>Come of Age, </i>the Vaccines prove they've done nothing of the sort. What they <i>have </i>done is create a quasi-concept album about a rock band treating its job with the checked-out disinterest of an office drone, doing the bare minimum to get by, learning nothing, and being scared to death by the obligations that come with appearing to give a shit. </p>
<p>As before, the music on <i>Come of Age </i>is wholly uncomplicated yet capable of winning listeners over by deftly straddling a very fine semantic distinction. Can you tell the difference between the figurative ""you've heard this before"" and the literal ""you haven't heard <i>this</i> before"" and want music to embody both? There's absolutely nothing the Vaccines do that hasn't been approved, market-tested, and confirmed over the past 30 years of British rock that warily views any encroachment of electronic music, hip-hop-- basically anything not evolving from the Jam-- as a threat. The faster numbers barge in with a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30w8DyEJ__0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Brianstorm""</a>-like whirl of drum rolls and tremolo picking, then immediately taper off. The slower ones pick and choose from any number of song structures you vaguely remember from whatever <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28199-the-drums/"" target=""_blank"">Drums</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">Strokes</a> album you listened to last. Not a single band member seems capable of doing anything without the other three's approval: Vocal melodies move completely in lockstep with well-worn progressions, and occasionally just mimic the bass root notes. There's an occasional spray of surf rock, but otherwise <i>Come of Age </i>is utterly subservient to Young's lyrics. </p>
<p>The established templates make <i>Come of Age </i>catchy at the very least, even if Young treats his gift for sticky choruses like ""No Hope"" and ""Aftershave Ocean"" like something that would make him feel guilty if he decided to sell insurance for a living. It's fine that this is music driven by personality rather than innovation, but Young lacks the charm to be likeable or even the swagger to be <i>unlikeable </i>either. As a result, <i>Come of Age </i>becomes an inverse <i>Portnoy's Complaint </i>where the narrator morbidly fixates on the utter meaninglessness of every single one of his thoughts. Let him tell it: ""I could bore you with the truth about an uneventful youth/ Or you could get that rap from someone else."" ""So let's go to bed before you say something real/ Let's go to bed before you say how you feel."" ""I'm no teenage icon/ I'm no Frankie Avalon/ I'm nobody's hero."" ""You can't hold a gun to my head/ Because baby I would just refuse."" Even spread across the entity of <i>Come of Age</i>, it would be a disconcerting admission of serious writer's block or more likely crippling laziness. Those lines are all within <i>the first four songs.</i></p>
<p>It goes on like this, as evidenced by ""Bad Mood""'s surely self-aware taunt, ""You look disappointed in me/ I'm not as thoughtful as you thought I'd be."" More revealing is ""Weirdo"". Stylistically, it's the most outré inclusion on <i>Come of Age</i>, if only because its juddering bassline recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"" target=""_blank"">Pixies</a> and they're American. But the Vaccines pretty much reject any of Frank Black's lyrical lessons as Young pleads, ""I'm not a weirdo,"" to win a girl's heart. You look further down the tracklist and, surely, a song entitled ""I Wish I Was a Girl"" is willing to cop to <i>something</i>? Sorta-- Young moans, ""Life is easy when you're easy on the eye,"" and you might even overlook the deflating misogyny of that statement and find relief in the fact that he finally says what's been implied the whole time: He envies people who are <i>expected</i> not to have anything to say.</p>
<p>Which quite obviously renders the regular-guy shtick the Vaccines play on <i>Come of Age </i>as total bullshit, especially since you can purchase a deluxe version with bonus tracks and an entire extra disc of live cuts. It's as oily and slick-talking as any political figure trying to ascend to a position of tremendous power while convincing the populace they're ""one of us,"" an easier path to take than simultaneously exhibiting leadership and empathy. But not even the soft bigotry of low expectations can suffice here since <i>Come of Age </i>hardly feels escapist. In fact, it's even more of a dystopian nightmare than <i>Kid A </i>or an El-P record: The Vaccines draw us into a universe that revolves entirely around Young, and if he's got nothing to say, his only possible conclusion is that nobody does.</p>

That title was disconcerting: Jens Lekman's music is the kind you look to when you need confirmation that love <i>is</i> the end of the world. Over the past decade, few songwriters have dedicated themselves to dramatizing the rise and fall of the heart as brilliantly as Lekman. Whether he's falling in love at the post office or making out during a boring Sunday sermon, his well-detailed, gracefully arranged songs inflate everyday moments and view the most banal aspects of modern life through rosy lenses, as though somebody's constantly spiking his drinks with love potion. So the message of this new song was a stark departure. Coming from the guy who once wrote a song about using his one prison phone call to dedicate a love song to a girl on the radio, a chorus like ""A broken heart is not the end of the world"" brings with it Santa's-not-real-either levels of illusion-shattering.</p>
<p>But even for the most hopelessly romantic Lekman fans, two years should have been long enough for the track to reveal itself as a grade-A grower. There are a few characteristic laugh-lines (""It's bigger than the Flatbush Avenue Target! And their pharmacy department!""), but mostly ""End of the World"" glides through a wide variety of tones, scenes, and feelings, as Lekman's breezy delivery distracts from how difficult it is to write a song that's so emotionally precise yet complex. The second verse finds him in Washington, D.C., on the night of the 2008 presidential election, trying to reconcile his private heartbreak with the public elation exploding around him-- and the strange happiness he feels in that moment, too. This isn't ""Black Cab"", his magnificently gloomy 2003 ode to being bummed when everyone around you is happy. It's a song about the infinite shades of gray that exist between joy and sadness. These are not always easy things to capture in pop songs, but they're the hues he's chasing throughout <i>I Know What Love Isn't</i>. During a six-minute song about the painfully prolonged end of a relationship (""The World Moves On"") someone snips, ""I wish you just would have cheated on me instead."" For one thing, that would have been an easier song to write.</p>
<p>All of this means that <i>I Know What Love Isn't</i> is, by some stretch, the hardest Jens Lekman record to love-- or at least feel instantly infatuated with. His earlier songs specialized in big, bombastic choruses and memorable hooks-- the kind of writ-large tricks that leave you swooning on first listen. But he's after something different here. A word that Lekman's repeatedly used when describing the record is ""aerodynamic,"" and in a <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/update/8857-jens-lekman/"">recent interview</a> he said, ""You know how in the early 90s, a lot of the songs were very focused on the verses being very quiet, and the choruses being super loud, like Nirvana? I was looking for the opposite of that, where you hardly notice where the chorus starts; it's just like an airplane taking off from a runway, smooth, and all of a sudden you're in the air.""</p>
<p>Though he sometimes takes this ""smoothness"" to an extreme (the Spanish guitar solo and saxophone riff make ""Erica America"" one of the more divisive songs in his oeuvre), it's most gainfully employed in the service of some of Lekman's classic lyrical sleights of hand. He's always gotten a kick out of wordplay (""And when she talked about the fall/ I thought she talked about Mark E. Smith"" remains one of his greatest deadpans), but on the standout ""Become Someone Else's"", it's used with remarkable deftness-- not a punchline so much as a gutpunch. Over a moseying, Bacharach-y piano riff, the title phrase transforms from an idyllic profession (""Life's too good to become someone else's"") to an image of loneliness ('That lonesome feeling and what it tells us/ Sleeping on my arm 'til it becomes someone else's""). It's funny, until it's not-- at which point you realize that it ranks up there with his best songs.</p>
<p>Before <i>I Know What Love Isn't</i>, Lekman's gone so far as to say that he hates ""albums."" His terrific 2005 record <i>Oh You're So Silent Jens</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> was actually a singles collection, and when it came time to assemble the tracklist for his arguable career highlight <i>Night Falls Over Kortedala</i>, he let his friends choose what should make the cut. The hodgepodge approach suited him well, and those records had a feel that was both panoramic and casual: A song about his girlfriend was followed by a song about his barber, each as expertly sketched. </span><i>I Know What Love Isn't </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">is, he admits, singularly focused on heartbreak, and because its 10 songs are variations on a single theme, he's said it feels like the first proper album he's made. But he's the first one to point out the casualties of thematic maturity: ""[</span><i>On Night Falls Over Kortedala</i>], I created a big rainbow of different colors on my little palette,"" he explains. ""But, for this album, I only chose a few of those colors, so it's a little bit more held back."" Ultimately, some of those missing colors leave a void.</p>
<p>But even when he focuses his unflagging talents within fixed bounds, Lekman's still one of the most distinct and observant writers in indie rock today. The understated closer, ""Every Little Hair Knows Your Name"", is a gem, as wrenching as it is lyrically agile. The title and first verse make it sound like a love song, until the phrase ""when we broke up"" drops like an anvil. ""Every chord I struck was a miserable chord,"" he croons, and then plucks a few examples, note by mournful note. ""It all sounds the same, every chord knows your name."" It's heartbreak at its most sumptuously sad, as though he's taking back everything he said before. It actually sounds like the end of the world.</p></div>"|16979.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16979-i-know-what-love-isnt/|7.7|Lindsay Zoladz

Between tours and album cycles for the last two <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1183-drive-by-truckers/"" target=""_blank"">Drive-By Truckers</a> records, 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13993-the-big-to-do/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Big To-Do</i></a> and 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15125-go-go-boots/"" target=""_blank""><i>Go-Go Boots</i></a>, Hood decided to spend his down time writing a novel. Conceived while he was on the road for <i>To-Do</i>, the book was supposed to be a semi-autobiographical novel about a deeply troubled period in his life back in the early 90s. ""I was 27, my band broke up, I got divorced and left my hometown to live in Memphis,"" Hood writes in the promotional materials for <i>Heat Lightning Rumbles in the Distance</i>. ""My car got stolen, our band's truck got stripped and I fell in love. I fell out with my family (who I was very, very close to) and had my heart broken. I seriously pondered killing myself several times but instead wrote literally over 500 songs in a three-year period.""</p>
<p>Considering Hood's songwriting prolificacy, it shouldn't come as a surprise that his plans for a book eventually turned into an album. But the songs on <i>Heat Lightning</i> aren't otherwise typical for Hood, as they're drawn more directly from his own life than the character studies and southern noir tales of petty crime and drunken malfeasance that he's known for. <i>Heat Lightning</i> is also more hopeful than much of his work, including his previous solo record, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13106-murdering-oscar-and-other-love-songs/"" target=""_blank""><i>Murdering Oscar (And Other Love Songs)</i></a>. The songs might be inspired by the bleakest part of Hood's personal history, but he's looking at it from a safe distance, with the perspective of a family man with a much improved station in life.</p>
<p>The album's titular metaphor is reminiscent of ""Tornadoes"" from 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2509-the-dirty-south/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Dirty South</i></a>, one of Hood's most unsettling and evocative songs about a twister literally tearing families apart. But the sense of foreboding that exists in the title track is an echo from a far-off past; it exists in a different reality from where the song's protagonist currently stands with his wife and their ""babies at our feet"" as ""the warm summer wind blows"" like a salve. And so it goes for many of the low-key rumblers on <i>Heat Lightning</i>: Hood's songs survey lives (or perhaps just ""life"") marked by alcoholism, loneliness, loss of loved ones, and lessons learned the hard way. But any sadness or desperation on this record is filtered through the reassuring knowledge that these hard times eventually passed.</p>
<p><i>Heat Lightning</i>, then, is a life-affirming album disguised as a depressing song cycle, with the gut-level power of Hood's best work cut back significantly. It is very much a ""home"" record by a man who typically makes ""road"" records, with the noticeable lack of urgency that suggests. Even though Hood recruits several of his cohorts in Drive-By Truckers as backing musicians, and adds ringers like Kelly Hogan and Centro-matic's Will Johnson, there's no mistaking <i>Heat Lightning </i>for anything other than a solo album, and a relatively low-stakes one at that. Hood has assembled a loose narrative connecting the songs, but many of them still sound like unfinished demos, with their rough edges and occasionally under-developed arrangements. ""Leaving Time"" is a customary guitar strum and clomping drum beat hastily fastened together, which actually works fairly well considering the song is about shoving off from home for a tour. (""Hush little baby, have no fear/ I'm six more tours 'til the end of the year,"" Hood sings, like he's said it many times before.) The straight-ahead anti-love song ""Better Off Without"" is more of a throwaway, though it does feature the album's most memorably chunky guitar riff, while ""Better Than the Truth"" is a jaunty folk-country number that sounds like a mid-afternoon jam concocted over beers and barbecue.</p>
<p>Even the best songs on <i>Heat Lightning</i>-- the pained late-night soul ballad ""After the Damage"" and the cinematic ""12:01"", which has a wonderful line about ""zombies"" crossing county lines to buy liquor in the wee hours of the night-- don't quite measure up to the high standard that Hood established with the Truckers or even the underrated, often brilliant <i>Oscar</i>. It's a placeholder album from a man who has already written 20 songs that are better than the ones here.</p></div>"|17023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17023-heat-lightning-rumbles-in-the-distance/|6.5|Steven Hyden

Or at least, it does if the group in question is a pair of male twentysomethings. Since they formed, Oberlin buddies Nick Weiss and Logan Takahashi have treated hedonistic, crowd-moving dance music this way: as something colorful, captivating, and too delicate to handle roughly. The fragility of their music has helped make them interesting, but so far, it has also kept them from being great. Their second full-length, <i>Tracer</i>, is a step deeper into a fantasy Teengirl might call their own. But there remains a gap between fiddling creatively with the music you love and making music that succeeds as clearly on its own terms, and Weiss and Takahashi haven't quite closed it yet.</p>
<p>In some ways, their defining statement remains Weiss' <a href=""http://grooveshark.com/#!/search/song?q=Teengirl+Fantasy+Touch+My+Body"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">slowing down of Mariah Carey's ""Touch My Body""</a> past the point of recognizability, a calling-card moment that heightened expectations for their debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14635-7am/"" target=""_blank""><i>7AM</i></a>. That record never quite fought its way out of the middle-- the middle of the road, the middle of the dynamic range, the aesthetic midpoint between the drama of the records they loved and the remove they approached them from. The best song, ""Cheaters"", once again hitched its star to a super-heated vocal performance, the churchy Philly-soul grit of Love Committee's ""Cheaters Never Win"". On <i>Tracer</i>, they take another step away from the music of the past, bringing in a handful of guest vocalists, including Panda Bear, Kelela, and Laurel Halo, with mixed results.</p>
<p>Laurel Halo's voice is awfully close to a synth tone already, and it floats weightlessly around the synth programming on ""Mist of Time"". Panda Bear's voice fraternizes uncomfortably with the pistoning rubbery drum and mechanical Detroit-house atmosphere on ""Pyjama"". <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13974-efx-ft-kelela/"" target=""_blank"">""EFX""</a>, featuring Kelela, doesnt work at all. The vocals are simply thin, and the song's disparate parts-- the meandering chorus melody, the tinny sixteenth-note hi-hats, the uncertain, shuddering rhythm of the synths, the syncopated finger pops-- just don't cohere. It isn't a shrewd recasting of a standard R&amp;B song; it's simply an ineptly made example of one.</p>
<p>On the rest of the record, however, Weiss and Takahashi lay out their visions in purely instrumental terms, and the production is sumptuous and beautifully tactile. This is what Teengirl Fantasy do best: They craft immaculate headphones music, full of enveloping small details. The panning synth on ""Orbit"" hits like sunlight on a river, while the watery blub of the drums and the little whispers that strafe across the mix all suggest an environment alive with tiny sounds of life. ""Vector Spray"" is built on a beat that sounds like feet splashing in shallow water and then wraps perspective-bending synth prisms around it. ""Eternal"" surrounds a breath-caught heartbeat pulse with a firefly storm of soft lights.</p>
<p>On tracks like these, Teengirl build a world that feels very much their own, a place where industrial soot and grime mixes with blinding rainbow light.  The music is both layered and weightless, misty and bright. If <i>Tracer</i> has significant replay value, it's for the parsing of the details of its light-filled surface, for the sounds themselves. During these moments, the music that inspired Weiss and Takahashi to start making music in the first place feels pleasantly remote.</p></div>"|16939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16939-tracer/|7.0|Jayson Greene

Sonically, <i>Sebenza</i> is strung somewhere between UK funky and South Africa's kwaito, two invigoratingly elastic dance music worlds that draw on a rich and overlapping heritage. Vocally it features turns from three distinctive South African acts, Johannesburg's rapper/producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29021-spoek-mathambo/"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">Spoek Mathambo</span></a> and <span class=""s1"">Okmalumkoolkat</span> of music/performance art crew <a href=""http://dirtyparaffin.tumblr.com/%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Paraffin</a> along with Cape Town kwaito duo <a href=""http://phira007.wix.com/ruffestzelizwepromotions"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">Ruffest</span></a>. Each taps into, bounces off of, and elevates different elements in LV's music. And lyrically it's laced with a potent mix of languages: Zulu, Xhosa, English, and each MC's idiosyncratic slang. Those junctures and juxtapositions tease a thrillingly new energy into being, one that breeds a deeper infatuation with every lean closer.</p>
<p>LV's journey towards <i>Sebenza</i>, which means ""work"" in Zulu, began with a trip that Gerv Gordon took to South Africa at the end of 2009 to visit family (he was born in Cape Town but moved to London as a child). There, <a href=""http://blackdownsoundboy.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/okzharp.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">invigorated by the music scenes he encountered</span></a>, he was introduced to Okmalumkoolkat through Spoek Mathambo, which resulted in 2010's tightly wound firecracker <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtg4nu5C-SI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""<span class=""s1"">Boomslang</span>""</a>,<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtg4nu5C-SI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a>  setting the precedent for subsequent collaborations with Spoek and Ruffest.</p>
<p>Hailing from the township of Nyanga close to Cape Town, Kwaito duo Ruffest rap in a mix of Xhosa and English. Mirroring the duo's bullet-like, on-the-beat, almost grime delivery, LV's production for Ruffest's features is taut and punchy. While ""Nothing Like Us"" and ""ThaTha Lo"" have that chin-jutting dancefloor bounce, ""Hustla"" strikes a chord with the global club underground's current spooky/sexy strain. Gorgeous album closer ""Uthando Lwaka"", which means something between your love and love salvation in Xhosa, pits Ruffest's roughness against garage skips and squeals to surprisingly heart-leaping effect.</p>
<p>With Spoek Mathambo, who this year released his second experimental hip-hop album, <i>Father Creeper</i>, on Sub Pop, LV had license to get abstract, resulting in the two most quietly reflective moments on the record. ""Limb"" and ""Work"" both fizz with funk's low-slung sensual energy, albeit at a fraction of the pace, with the latter's skittering finger clicks providing perfect kindling to Spoek's skeletal lyrics. While his presence is minimal, Spoek's features act as crucial pivot points and breathing spaces on <i>Sebenza</i>'s otherwise non-stop ride.</p>
<p>It's Okmalumkoolkat who's the undisputed star of the show, however, and not only because he features on eight of the album's 14 tracks. He has something of a Keith Haring pep to his post-it note flow, spitting sharply and wittily on the universal intricacies of digital life. ""Dude, we need many more hits/ Yeah, I know,"" he playfully back-chats himself on ""Animal Prints"". Perhaps because they've worked together before, LV are at their most amped-up and angular on the tracks featuring Okmalumkoolkat, providing the acrobatic MC with plenty of audio hinges to spring off and distilling his frenetic energy with skillful framing. </p>
<p>On title track ""Sebenza"", an ode to putting your back into it, his rolling ""r""s ricochet off LV's synths, working their tension into something urgent and infectious. Then on ""International Pantsula"", he channels Joyce Sims' late-80s hit ""Come Into My Life"" on the hook, vocoder warping the line to ""you gotta check out my blog, I got so much shit to show you,"" as if to underline that the spirit of our times is more often about likes not love. It's not all jokes though: again on ""Sebenza"" he slips in, ""Since a way back they've been trying to silence us.../ Rubber bullets."" Those final two words wobble menacingly atop a precipice of bass, a disillusioned allusion to the South African police service's infamous and inflammatory employment of them at many social protests of the past few years. </p>
<p>An understanding that runs deeper than accessible language is the challenge and reward that Sebenza offers. Do we need to know what an artist is saying to hear what they're saying? Do we need a translation to respond to the energy? In the 21st century these questions should be as rhetorical as they feel. ""I'm a Zulu confuser/ Zulu computer/ Zulu wha' wha' what?"" teases Okmalumkoolkat on the ultra ear-wormy ""Zula Compurar"". Then on the divinely disheveled ""Spitting Cobra"" he pleads, ""My slang is my language/ Please understand it/ Please understand it.""</p>
<p>With <i>Sebenza</i>, LV meet Okmalumkoolkat, Ruffest, and Spoek Mathambo on common ground somewhere between South London and South Africa. What they've so deftly achieved is providing the space for each MC to carve out their own story: They neither swamp nor leave them adrift. The tracks feel like true collaborations rather than features. The energy exchange feels mutual. <i>Sebenza</i> feels like the future, now.</p></div>"|17137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17137-sebenza/|8.0|Ruth Saxelby

<p>Those Sensate Focus singles (whose titles-- <i>10</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>3.33333333333333333</i>-- correspond to an energy measurement for the <a href=""http://titan.bloomfield.edu/facstaff/dnicolai/Physics/Physics105/Phy105-lessons/lesson9-105.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">latent heat fusion of water</a>, though I've no idea exactly what that means, or if this is a coincidence) are the most straightforward, emotionally resonant pieces Fell's ever recorded. They look back to the early 90s, when house was mingling with techno, and the result was acerbic, concrete soul. The <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/release/eMEGO+143"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Editions Mego page for <i>Sentielle</i></a> offers ""Recommended contextual materials"" from this era (an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPFaeg-IHw0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">obscure MK remix of Chez Damier</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqqDCjq7YwI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Choo Ables' ""Hard to Get""</a>). I like to think Fell had to be talked out of labeling these selections ""homework."" That same Editions Mego page also offers a roadmap for heroic DJs. Show your work for full credit: ""Track 4, 128 bpm with 60 units each lasting 117.19ms, with inserted pauses of between 4 and 80 units.""</p>
<p>You get the idea: <i>Sentielle</i> is heady stuff. Like previous albums <i>UL8</i> and especially the fantastic <i>Multistability</i>, it's a parched, bone-pale collection of rhythms and counter-rhythms. What's frightening isn't that it's more extreme than its predecessors; it's that <i>Sentielle</i> apparently represents Fell's vision of trance-like, highly emotive dance music. Fell's work is intense and reptilian, non-confrontational in the same way that the Cold War was really just scientists thousands of miles apart hovering over buttons; a show of brutality would humanize the battle.</p>
<p>Mathematical analogies and explanations help me understand why a composer as talented as Fell would make this music, but they're not necessary to enjoy it. It's best not to focus on the calculations, to stop trying to discern all of the different rhythmic elements and let them wash over you. <i>Sentielle</i> is mostly these rhythms, pointillist attacks so detailed they sound random, especially at first, though they surely aren't. What sets <i>Sentielle</i> apart amongst Fell's work is the residual synth pools that tremble like oil on water. They are sparse and alien, but they reflect light in a way their host matter can't. Fell's synths and snatches of melody sound imperfect set against his rhythms, a contrast stark enough that <i>Sentielle</i> acquires a singular mood. It sounds like a distant, long-lost uncle to the slappy, harsh surfaces turned out by younger artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30014-jam-city/"" target=""_blank"">Jam City</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29250-girl-unit/"" target=""_blank"">Girl Unit</a>.</p>
<p><i>Sentielle</i> is a study in deprivation, a reminder that psychedelic experiences can occur while totally sober if you deny yourself food, or rest. Fell denies us much of what we expect from dance music: a sense of journey, a traceable rhythm, a defined purpose or utility. In doing so, and in offering us oases of melody, he approaches trance from the complete opposite direction. You can still burrow down, nod out, ask how many stars are in the sky; unlike most trance music, <i>Sentielle</i> will encourage you to count.</p></div>"|17144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17144-sentielle-objectif-actualite/|7.5|Andrew Gaerig

Holed up in a de-sanctified church in the town of Anacortes, Wash., he began making music of heightened attention-- to surroundings, to his consciousness, to nature. The albums are full of the kind of observations you find time to make only when you haven't talked to anyone for a few weeks. May's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16657-clear-moon/"" target=""_blank""><i>Clear Moon</i></a> was a dreamy fantasia about home, its comforts, and also the trickle of anxiety you feel when you are reminded of its fragility. The midnight-black <i>Ocean Roar</i>, meanwhile, is an experiment in imagined homelessness: It has a facing-the-beast quality of a punishing spiritual quest, as if Elverum steeled himself and left his house at midnight, barefoot, and just kept walking.</p>
<p><i>Clear Moon</i> opened with the faint sigh of a single acoustic guitar-- a tree branch scraping your bedroom window, maybe-- but <i>Ocean Roar</i>'s ""Pale Lights"" opens on a storm, an an ominous churn of organ and drums signaling the imminent arrival of bad feelings. As he always does, Elverum shapes sounds so that they arrive in tantalizing pulses: When he sings, ""a small yelp on the wind/ And then, more roaring,"" over the murk of the music, which has suddenly died down, you are squinting through the album's black-night sound to discern moving shapes just as he is. This odd sensation, of straining to hear music piping through buds wedged directly into your ears, is a good sign that you're in Elverum's world; it gives his music a fragile air, like something that might not survive without your intervention.</p>
<p>Elverum's voice sounds more frail than ever here, flanked by bleak, oppressive towers of electric guitar. He's talked about the influence of black metal on his music before, and it has surfaced sonically on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13299-winds-poem/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wind's Poem</i></a> and elsewhere, but <i>Ocean Roar</i> is the first place you can <i>feel</i> it: The spine-scraping, all-sixteenths tremolo'd guitars of the Popol Vuh cover ""Engel Der Luft"" channel the tinny evil of early black-metal recordings; ""Waves"" pounds mercilessly with drum rolls and a nastily distorted bass guitar for nearly its entire running time, with Elverum surfacing only for a moment to mumble the album's title and disappear beneath the noise. He casts himself as a small force lost in the wake of something huge, and seems mostly interested in black metal for its elemental dread.</p>
<p>In the middle of all this gnarled, frozen-gray bleakness, the gentler moments gleam like snow-globe hallucinations. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14135-i-walked-home-beholding/"" target=""_blank"">""I Walked Home Beholding""</a> is the charmed center of the record, the moment when the noise clears and Elverum surveys, with his signature quiet awe, the power of nature to bury his small town. It is the kind of redemptive, reassuring note that many might choose to close on; everything's all right, kids, here comes the moon. Or, in Elverum-speak: ""Totally at peace with the meaninglessness of living."" But the final track, immediately following ""I Walked Home"", is a seven-minute, tar-thick pulse of droning guitars (one of two slightly overlong instrumentals on this quite short record) that threaten to blot out everything else before them, before cutting off, sharp, hot, and sputtering, trailing abruptly into an unsettled silence. What Elverum wants to convey with this rude closing is unclear, but one thing is certain: The storm, metaphorical or otherwise, has closed back in behind him.</p></div>"|16988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16988-ocean-roar/|8.1|Jayson Greene

Always self-aware but never self-obsessed, Mould's divergent songbook serves as a mood-ring measure of his personal journey from angry adolescent punk to out-and-proud adult, and of his wavering desire to engage with the contemporary alt-rock for which he essentially wrote the playbook. But Mould has, uncharacteristically, spent the last few years taking stock of his past, penning a tell-all autobiography with Michael Azerrad, and overseeing Merge's 20th-anniversary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16862-sugar-reissues/"" target=""_blank"">reissues</a> of the Sugar catalog. Now, with his demons fully exorcised and emotional baggage tossed aside, Mould is game to plug in and rev up again.</p>
<p>Just as Sugar emerged in 1992 right as Hüsker Dü's legacy was becoming manifest in both the chart-conquering crunch of Nirvana and the underground-overturning squall of My Bloody Valentine, <i>Silver Age</i> arrives as a totem of Mould's continued influence on today's mainstream rock (Foo Fighters, Green Day) and indie-level (No Age, Japandroids) artists alike. Recorded with the band he used to tour 2009's stately <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12913-life-and-times/"" target=""_blank""><i>Life and Times</i></a>-- bassist Jason Narducy and Superchunk/Mountain Goats drummer Jon Wurster-- <i>Silver Age</i> immediately establishes itself as a more roaring, rambunctious affair. In fact, the album is so true to fuzz-pop form that you might easily mistake it for an unearthed bonus disc of quality Sugar outtakes from those recent reissues; the opening anti-sellout screed ""Star Machine"" could even pass for a 90s-era comment on mallternative-rock chancers. The title track, however, firmly asserts the record as the work of a modern-day Mould when he declares, ""I'm never too old to contain my rage,"" before spitting on the ""stupid little kid [who] wanna hate my game."" Yet there's a vigor and vitality running through <i>Silver Age</i> that belies those cranky-old-man sentiments; while there is much to admire about Mould's penchant for taking risks and shifting creative course, no fan would complain if he simply delivered euphoric power-pop knockouts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13999-the-descent/"" target=""_blank"">""The Descent""</a>, ""Briefest Moment"", and ""Keep Believing"" in perpetuity.</p>
<p>The Sugar reissues provide a convenient yardstick with which to measure the strength of the songs here, though they also draw attention to the new album's monochromatic sound<i>-- Silver Age</i> would benefit from a destabilizing dose of loopy psychedelia à la ""Hoover Dam"", or a more direct appeal to heart in the vein of ""If I Can't Change Your Mind"" to bring greater dimension to the album's workmanlike drive. But just as those classic Hüsker Dü records suggested an infinite depth of noise despite their pancaked production, Mould still covers a lot of ground here while staying in the red. From the dreamy, ""Man on the Moon""-style drone of ""Steam of Hercules"" to the foreboding urgency of ""Angels Rearrange"", Mould just sounds so perfectly at home when howling in the face of a hurricane-- his voice is as natural a complement to a hazily overdriven power chord as Brian Wilson's is to a harpsichord. <i>Silver Age</i> is a suitably self-deprecating title from an artist whose considerable cachet hasn't always allowed him to cash in; Mould effectively owns up to his contrarian tendencies when, in ""The Descent"", he admits, ""I didn't want to play the song/ That gave people so much hope."" But as a showcase of a seasoned master in his element, <i>Silver Age</i>'s bounty of direct, distorto-pop hits measures up to Mould's gold standard.</p></div>"|16981.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16981-silver-age/|7.6|Stuart Berman

Warner, who's performed for years with producer Peter Wade under the moniker <a href=""http://mndr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MNDR</a>, makes buzzy synthpop amid a deafening buzz of likeminded bands, and from any point in her career, it's a short step to two or three rough analogues or influences. After a couple of years jobbing behind the scenes for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and others, Warner's break came in 2010 when she lent a careening hook and Francophone snappiness to ""Bang Bang Bang"" by Mark Ronson, an act arguably better known for his antecedents (the vague, remembered 1960s), protégées, and followers than his actual music. This proves apt. The EP that caught Ronson's notice, <i>E.P.E</i>.<i>, </i>strutted and shouted and revived all the 80s synthpop fit to get print. It commanded both attention and an inevitable clutter of comparisons: La Roux, Santigold, Goldfrapp.</p>
<p>The namedrops were predictable, but not entirely unwarranted. Warner's said she turned down various unnamed honchos with Katy Perry designs, though she didn't mind tossing tracks about with Patrik Berger, who co-wrote Robyn's ""Dancing on My Own"", and in the past few years she's built up a small battalion of collaborators eager to emulate that track. <i>E.P.E. </i>and its follow-ups are primarily Warner and Wade's work, but it's hard not to hear their influences. ""I go my own way…/ This is my anthem,"" Warner sang on lead single ""I Go Away"" over meticulously rippling percussion and sumptuous synths; her way, by all indications, was stylish and fully formed, but perhaps a little too timely.</p>
<p>Two years later, Warner's debut LP arrives in much the same manner. She bursts off the cover of <i>Feed Me Diamonds </i>amid neon and chrome shrapnel; it's arresting, but it's pastiche. The music inside is much the same: 12 mostly solid electro-pop tracks that are immediate, immaculate, and suited equally to outlets populist-- ""U.B.C.L."" appeared in <i>Jersey Shore</i> in a prior rewrite-- and outré. The album's custom-built, in other words, to the synthpop template of the past few years. Some tracks veer house, others electroclash, others toward an 80s slow dance. Strewn through the mix are percussion stutters and pinball noises, and dubstep touches you could actually call tasteful. ""Burning Hearts"" begins with hoover synths, guitar bluster, and slivered vocal samples, like the Sleigh Bells/Purity Ring hybrid that legions undoubtedly asked for; it's even got spider imagery that could have crawled off the latter's debut. ""Waiting"" rides either a ""Tainted Love"" groove or whatever's left of it after three decades of further tainting. Albums like these have a few things in common. They're generally likeable. They almost always sound fantastic. At their worst, they substitute sheen for swagger and noise for punch; at their best, they have all four. </p>
<p>At <i>her </i>best, MNDR does. Single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12996-1-in-heaven/"" target=""_blank"">""#1 in Heaven""</a>, inspired by kidnapped then corrupted robber-heiress Patty Hearst, gleams like a bumper sticker; it turns her post-arrest taunts into a killer hook (""Tell them I'm smiling/ Send my greetings"") and her bank stickup into instructions for the dance floor (""put your hands above your head….""). Warner's similarly occupied on loopy club anthem ""U.B.C.L."", a rework of <i>EPE</i>'s leadoff track, skewed only as much as its title. It's half as clever as it thinks it is, but probably twice as functional. ""Sparrow Voices"" is bracing, Warner and a sequencer trying to outfeint one another, though it's probably advisable to ignore anything it's trying to say about the cracks in China's economy.</p>
<p>That's the sort of topicality MNDR ascribes to almost every track. She's called the album an attempt to ""[challenge] money, wealth, power and the class system,"" an admirable goal for a different occasion. It's not that dance-pop can't be subverted, but Hearst repurposed as a dancing queen is roughly par here. ""Fall in Love With the Enemy"" doesn't get much deeper than saying it isn't a choice. ""Blue Jean Youth"" is a list of nostalgia checkpoints that aims for iconic but lands somewhere around clip art. These are missteps, though, and few. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13857-faster-horses/"" target=""_blank"">""Faster Horses""</a>, named for an apocryphal Henry Ford quote (""if I'd asked my customers what they wanted, they'd have said faster horses"") is noisy and addled-- the vague vocal patois on ""the front <i>ro-ow</i>... you don't <i>kno-ow</i>” has too many similarities to mention-- but as a commentary on the genre's demand for ever-catchier material, it works.</p>
<p><i>Feed Me Diamonds </i>is best, though, when it gets emotionally heady. At first ""Stay"" sounds too chilly, too insistent on delivering pat soundbites like ""I'm not going to fade away,"" but the way the chorus trails off and the catch in Warner's voice when she sings ""aching"" betrays the act. The title track, meanwhile, is all catches. It's got its footnotes-- the reference this time is a quote by performance artist Marina Abramović about how her father was killed after being fed fine-pureed diamonds-- but you don't need to consult them to hear the masochism in Warner's voice as she meanders from the first crafted couplet (""lie with me, lie to me"") on through reduction and dismantlement metaphors. MNDR always had style; here, at least, the substance has caught up. </p></div>"|16945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16945-feed-me-diamonds/|7.1|Katherine St. Asaph

These guys-- producers Shlohmo, R.L. Grime, and Jonwayne, amongst others-- dig (nearly) everything, from chart pop to the Seattle sigh of Elliott Smith, from Timbaland's early aughts production to the agro-rap of Three 6 Mafia and Waka Flocka Flame.</p>
<p>The 22-year old producer <a href=""http://ryanhemsworth.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Hemsworth</a>'s new EP, <i>Last Words</i>, is another sterling release from the collective, and while it's too scattered to be considered truly excellent, it's another reminder of the way hip-hop and electronic dance music continue to flirt with each other aggressively, like two high school freshmen who have the whole talking-to-each-other thing down and are just starting to reach that exalted next level.</p>
<p>Hemsworth has a history of making beats for such offbeat rap acts as Deniro Farrar and Main Attraktionz, and his work on <i>Last Words</i> skews close to the sounds he's employed in the past.  Though firmly influenced by the fuzzy, webby thud of Clams Casino, Hemsworth has a welcome tendency to drench his soundscapes in rainbow noise like his idol Hudson Mohawke, colorful bits of sound engaging the listener like a light show for purp-heads in a narcotic stupor. </p>
<p>Second track ""Colour &amp; Movement"", though it's the least danceable of everything here, is particularly impressive. Building around a sample from the German band Notwist, Hemsworth sets up a droning masterpiece, punctuated by schizoid drum machines and followed by an ominous minor keyboard loop which sounds a hell of a lot like ""Black and Yellow"". </p>
<p>""The Happy Mask Shop"",  starts in the same drone sphere as ""Colour &amp; Movement"", but takes off quickly when Timbaland-like drum machines are added, and drops sound out two-thirds of the way through to make way for the eerie harmonizing of a chorus of lady phantoms. It's haunting, elegant, and heavy, a song to be played in a cathedral that was converted into a nightclub and still hasn't been fully exorcized.</p>
<p>Every so often, Hemsworth gets overly enthusiastic and flips a sample unnecessarily. Even if opener ""Charly Wingate"" is clearly a tribute to the now forever-incarcerated Max B, the song's use of his ad-libs distracts from what would otherwise be a perfect dance track. But for the most part, the allusions are seamless, as on ""Slurring"", where Waka's offhand comment on his less-than-sober state from ""15th and the 1st"" becomes the basis for a maximalist, warped club track, which builds expertly, reaching a peak without ever becoming exhausting or frantic. This is perhaps Hemsworth's principal skill: managing tracks all the way through and avoiding tedium and redundancy.  </p>
<p>A set of uniformly solid beats like these also serves as a base upon which other producers can build. The strongest showing comes from Supreme Cuts, whose heady version of ""Overthinking"" stuffs the original with a whole new set of sounds, obscenely amplifying the highs to create the best club track on the album. But don't count out Baauer, whose already rapidly ascending profile should be boosted even further by his work on ""Slurring"", as he too converts something that was sitting on the rap-dance margins into a full-on rave track, with massive drum cycles and the undeniable shudder of uncut adrenaline.</p>
<p>The cloudy, purple sound that Hemsworth is working with here has graduated in the past year, as laid-back producers like Shlohmo and more aggressive ones like Rustie compete for the same space. Hemsworth, though not quite in the same category as those guys, marries the two mindsets. In the process he produces an EP that that gives the impression of being greedily, beautifully excessive, while in actuality remains more poised and controlled than something this fun has any right to be.  </p></div>"|17138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17138-last-words/|7.7|Jonah Bromwich

Formed by Kristina Lieberson, known best as the keyboardist for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27538-here-we-go-magic/"" target=""_blank"">Here We Go Magic</a>, TEEN make cloudy, lo-fi indie that wouldn't sound out of character being banged out in a suburban basement after homeroom. Lyrically, however, <i>In Limbo</i> deals with adult-style issues, which is the rub. While you get the sense that Lieberson herself is more than willing to provide a window into her thought process, the music suggests she isn't ready to make big decisions. Whereas a 14-year old snaps to decisions and sorts out the details later (if at all), TEEN too often hedge and equivocate, getting lost in their own thoughts.</p>
<p>You could say that <i>In Limbo</i> has a firm grip on vibe but a very loose sense of form. ""Better"" opens the album strongly, driven by a sharp vocal, pungent synth lines, and Moe Tucker-inspired drum primitivism, while Lieberson plainly but forcefully asserts, ""I do it better than anybody else."" Her post-punk punch is tougher than the song, but not by much. ""Better"" peaks around the three-minute mark-- the handclaps added to the chorus are a nice touch-- but then it continues on for two minutes more, neither changing nor adding anything new, a band content to play for itself.</p>
<p>With Here We Go Magic, this might have worked. Lieberson was an important cog in a strong machine there, and the whole band was precisely equivalent to the sum of its parts. Particularly in a live setting, they could stretch out and morph a simple rhythmic idea for what felt like an eternity, with each player's parts as fascinating to focus on as the clockwork sound of the entire band. With TEEN, this is not the case. The songs are dense and trebly, swirling and mutating but rarely growing, and too often staying way past their welcome. There are plenty of worthwhile ideas, but a seasoned producer could strategically shave 20 minutes off the album while losing little.</p>
<p>Without this sort of quality control, Lieberson's ideas get lost. <i>In Limbo</i> would definitely benefit from a few more songs with the animated romantic ache of ""Come Back"", and minus album-closer ""Fire"" (my first thought upon hearing the song's opening seconds was of the band glumly receiving the ""millionth customer"" prize for appropriating Hal Blaine's ""Be My Baby"" drums). The second half of the record, marked by the lingering dirges <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14053-unable/"" target=""_blank"">""Unable""</a> and ""Roses and Wine"", falls into a slumber. While ""Roses"" drags on for six-and-a-half minutes with nothing much to report, ""Unable"" is the best example of the album's need for some fresh ideas in the studio. The lyrics detail the emotional weight of the album's title, narrating the mundane predictability of person-to-person interactions and the seeming impossibility of breaking free of this rut. Humming along at a numbing pace, the song does no justice to such an interesting perception, though. TEEN have promise, and should make better albums than <i>In Limbo</i>,<i> </i>once the band gains the strength of Lieberson's convictions. With material like this, it's best to strive toward investigating and captivating rather than simply brooding.</p></div>"|16967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16967-in-limbo/|6.2|Eric Harvey

""When we were teenagers, we wanted to be the sky,"" she sang on her enduringly haunting 1998 record <i>Moon Pix</i>, her voice warbling at that moment as if she were delivering an elegy, like it's a shame we all at some point give up on those lofty and poetically illogical dreams. But <i>Sun</i> is a testament to what happens when that sensibility and logic somehow survive a turbulent adulthood: This, these weather-beaten and irrepressibly hopeful songs all seem to say, is what it sounds like when you still want to be the sky at 40.</p>
<p>In just about every way, <i>Sun</i> is a declaration of independence. There are, of course, the biographical facts, the things the record's defiant tone feels like a direct break with-- stage fright, substance abuse, break-ups, creative demons (it's been reported that Marshall scrapped some early demos because a friend told her they sounded too much like her older stuff). It is also the first Cat Power record to feature prominent synthesizers and (occasionally) Auto-Tune, though that doesn't exactly mean it sounds like anything on the radio right now. But you'd get these ideas about autonomy and independence just from perusing the lyric sheet, too. ""I want to live my way of living,"" she chants on the meditative ""Always on My Own"". The next song, ""Real Life"", is about the universality of grass-is-always-greener yearning (""I met a doctor/ He want to be a dancer/ I met a mother/ She want to be alone""). Spinning her years of tour-induced wanderlust into wisdom, Marshall offers them all some sage advice: ""Sometimes you gotta do what you don't wanna do/ To get away with an unordinary life.""</p>
<p>In the way it simultaneously embraces darkness and light and exists completely and defiantly outside of any larger musical trends (and clearly operates with no particular fear or hang-ups about kitsch-- check out that eagle sound effect on ""Cherokee""), the closest thing to <i>Sun</i> we've heard this year is probably <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16732-the-idler-wheel-is-wiser-than-the-driver-of-the-screw-and-whipping-cords-will-serve-you-more-than-ropes-will-ever-do/"" target=""_blank"">Fiona Apple's <i>The Idler Wheel</i></a>. But whereas Apple focuses on the highly idiosyncratic clockwork of her own brain, Marshall is more interested in the ways in which she is, in some fundamental human way, no different from anybody else. In some cases, this means grappling with her own privileges (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13768-ruin/"" target=""_blank"">""Ruin""</a>'s deceivingly upbeat chorus actually goes: ""Bitchin'/ Complainin'/ When some people ain't got shit to eat""). And in others, it means those sorts of bald-faced cosmic statements about mortality that few other artists can pull off (see: a song called ""Human Being"" that goes, ""You got a right to breathe/ You got a right/ You're a human being."") In her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/cat-power/"" target=""_blank"">recent profile</a> of Marshall, Amanda Petrusich linked Cat Power's songwriting philosophy back to an earlier time when ownership was a much looser concept and all songs were considered public domain. She sees people like this, too, including herself. So in the moments when <i>Sun</i> feels kitschy, it's because it's got a generousness of spirit that's fallen sharply out of fashion at some point, that something about our experience is public and shared, that we're all pretty alike just by virtue of being human.</p>
<p><i>Sun</i>'s middle stretch from ""Always on My Own"" to ""Human Being"" suffers from being a little muddy and unmelodic, but stick around for the finale. It starts with the late-night, long-walk-home soundtrack ""Manhattan""-- gorgeous, hypnotic, and quietly, unsentimentally lonely (""All the friends we used to know ain't coming back""). And then there's <i>Sun</i>'s late-sequenced, 11-minute centerpiece, ""Nothin But Time"". Which brings us back to that ""public domain"" idea: With its parade-float pace and self-consciously anthemic lyrics (""You got nothing but time/ And it ain't got nothing on you... It's up to you/ To be a superhero""), it is, yes, a clear homage to Bowie's ""Heroes"". But it's ""Hey Jude"", too: Marshall wrote it to cheer up her ex's teenage daughter, and the longer it goes on, the truer its optimistic truisms ring, the stronger the urge to holler them along with the rest of of voices (""You wanna live!""). It's an odd but fitting peak. By the sixth minute, when Iggy Pop's voice comes in god-sized and benevolent, it's like some sort of peyote daydream where one of the faces on Mount Rushmore stoops to talk to you and has only the kindest things to say.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe she's just talking to herself. ""Time, nothing but time,"" was another lyric she sang on <i>Moon Pix</i>, except there she moaned it a little bit like it was a prison sentence. Here it's a mantra. <i>Sun</i> doesn't reach the heights (or more accurately, wallow in the depths) of <i>Moon Pix</i>, but more than anything else she's made, it feels like a companion piece to that record, a conversation with an older and wiser voice. But what she seems to have learned out there is that wisdom means knowing less than you once thought you did, whether that means embracing some new instruments even if you have no idea how they work, or seeing sense where others see paradox. <i>Sun</i> is a double-exposed photo. You know those afternoons when the sun's high but somehow the moon's just unexpectedly hanging out, too? That's the kind of sky Marshall got to be.</p></div>"|16984.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16984-sun/|7.9|Lindsay Zoladz

His crew, though, has largely stayed in the background as he's ascended into the mainstream. Much of the magnetism of Rocky's early visuals came from the idea that the viewer was getting a look at a movement of culture already in progress, and though Rocky is highly central to that, there's a strength in numbers when it comes to those sorts of moments. This has been the power of Rocky and his A$AP Mob, much like it was the power of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler, the Creator</a> and the once nascent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a>. But the A$AP Mob is just now getting itself off the ground musically. Its members are highly visible backing up Rocky onstage or in certain corners of the Tumblrsphere, but there is no trove of mixtapes. You will not, in other words, find any A$AP Mob trading cards.</p>
<p>That is all beginning to change with <i>Lord$ Never Worry</i>, A$AP Mob's first group album and the crew's first major release since Rocky's debut album. Rocky's presence looms (he appears on six of 18 songs), but this is the coming-out party for the guys who have spent the last year-plus in his orbit. The results, though, are extremely mixed-- the Mob's image emerged fully-formed, but its music is still, at best, rough and unpolished. It is a work of a group of kids who are well-versed in the aesthetics of certain strands of rap, and who have good and nuanced ideas of what they want their own music to sound like. Unfortunately, much of the crew has yet to develop a voice strong enough to prop up these general notions-- <i>Lord$ Never Worry</i> is an attempt to build a house from the top down.</p>
<p>Where the album fails is precisely where A$AP Rocky succeeds, and the unintended side effect of <i>Lord$ Never Worry </i>may be a greater appreciation for what Rocky is able to pull off, even taking his own lackluster contributions into account. Rocky's music is a triumph of taste over skill, but there is a songcraft on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16026-liveloveaap/"" target=""_blank""><i>LIVELOVEA$AP </i></a>that just isn't present here. What's left is an album that is long, dark, and ugly, with little to none of the pop crossover or tactful stewing of regional sounds that colored Rocky's debut. <i>Lord$ Never Worry </i>instead uses the framework of producers like Clams Casino, AraabMuzik, and the Mob's own A$AP Ty Beats to trace out a new brand of cold, nihilistic New York rap.</p>
<p>It is, though, an idea better in theory than execution. The main issue is that guys like A$AP Nast, Da$h and A$AP Twelvyy-- who all appear across the tape-- are gruff shit-talkers who are competent on a basic level but largely indistinguished. In a different context, that style can provide an effective counterpoint to Rocky's jiggyness-- take, for instance, this <a href=""http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhw0meW5B7k5YM4y8m"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Funk Flex freestyle</a>. But when pushed to the forefront on songs like ""Full Metal Jacket"" or any of their various solo tracks here, straight-forwardness quickly becomes dullness, and ""workmanlike"" begins to take on negative connotations. There is little on <i>Lord$ Never Worry </i>that is illuminating lyrically or stylistically, or doesn't make you wish that the central figures were better or more experienced. </p>
<p>But there is A$AP Ferg, whose three solo tracks go a long way toward invalidating the previous three paragraphs. Ferg's style is similar to Rocky's-- his flow is hyper-musical, largely owing itself to the lithe sing-song rapping of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. It is a flow that is stilted and off-kilter, but delightfully so. His songs are jagged paths of space and tangled words, furious rapping and soulful singing. It is rap music that keeps you on your toes, that dips and swerves around you. He chooses beats that are outlines, then traverses outside the lines or barely colors anything at all-- he skips and skates all over the mournful, melting strings of ""Persian Wine"" then barks in short jabs throughout the spare, Luger-ish rattle of ""Work"". Ferg's voice is undoubtedly unique, and there's something thrilling in that he seemingly doesn't yet have a firm grip on it. Maybe he doesn't even need one-- he is, quite possibly, figuring out how not to figure it out.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Ferg, though, is the exception. The individual members of A$AP Mob have stepped out of the shadows and shown that they have a long way to go before establishing themselves as compelling figures on their own. The A$AP formula is a tricky one-- the amalgamation of revered and trendy sounds and styles invites each member to walk a very thin tightrope on the way to standing out. Rocky is maybe even better at it than people thought.</p></div>"|17070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17070-lords-never-worry/|4.9|Jordan Sargent

Songs of love and lust are commonplace, but romance? It seems to be a luxury we can no longer afford, which is a shame. Romance might only be artifice, but sometimes it's a necessary artifice, presenting an elusive vision that exists in our hearts and can only be made tangible in art. Even if <i>Long Slow Dance</i>, the fourth full-length album by San Francisco psych-pop group <a href=""http://thefreshandonlys.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Fresh &amp; Onlys</a>, were not loaded with excellent songs, it would be worthy of affection because it is so unabashedly imbued with this lost sense of romanticism. The band's principal songwriter, Tim Cohen, is pictured on the back cover as a typical po-faced indie rock dude with the de rigueur bushy beard and scraggly, mussed-up 'do. But on the record, he's a tuxedoed Fred Astaire doing a soft-shoe with Ginger Rogers through a wondrous black-and-white world. Lush and love struck, with a light-as-air melodicism that blesses the songs like sprinkles of pixie dust, <i>Long Slow Dance</i> dares to revel in that magical moment between a first kiss and the walk back to the car, and stretch it out to the length of a lifetime memory.</p>
<p>The Fresh &amp; Onlys pointed in this direction on 2010's great <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14736-play-it-strange/"" target=""_blank""><i>Play It Strange</i></a>, which was kicked off by the band's two best-ever songs, ""Summer of Love"" and ""Waterfall"". With its Beach Boys harmonies, gently rolling surf guitar, and Cohen's dreamy, reverb-heavy vocal, ""Summer of Love"" suggested a mood of escape that the more propulsive ""Waterfall"" explicitly spelled out in the lyrics. Frequently classified as revivalists, the Fresh &amp; Onlys were actually evolving into sensualists, and that process comes to a head on <i>Long Slow Dance</i>, which deals mainly in expressions of love at its most immediate and pleasurable.</p>
<p>Cohen is never more charming on <i>Long Slow Dance</i> than he is on the title track, a jangly strummer that supplements the Fresh &amp; Onlys' usual 1960s rock touchstones with nods to the Cure and the Church. ""You supply the innocent mind/ And I'll bring the guilty heart/ And borne together, we'll make the perfect romance,"" Cohen sings, his flat baritone cracking just enough to indicate a thawing of his previously cool façade. It's not clear whether the person he's singing to truly exists, nor does it matter; what's important is that Cohen's yearning is relatable even as the evocative music elevates it to poetic heights. Unlike many similar-minded groups that merely allude to prior examples of classic songwriting rather than carry on the tradition, ""Long Slow Dance"" is a genuinely fantastic example of the form, with Cohen following through a list of ""you're wonderful and I'm scum"" metaphors as the impossibly comely music conjures a quick tango underneath a starry sky.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Long Slow Dance</i> nearly matches that high level of swoony wonder. ""Dream Girls"" is a twangy lament in the vein of Chris Isaak, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14005-presence-of-mind/"" target=""_blank"">""Presence of Mind""</a> sounds custom-made for movie montages, with its giddy marimba flourishes and squiggly dream-sequence guitar riff from Wymond Miles. (It also carries the album's nut graph: ""Here lies a man with stars in his eyes/ What does he care if the future is bright?/ The future is bright, after tonight."")</p>
<p>Easily the slickest album the Fresh &amp; Onlys have made yet, <i>Long Slow Dance</i> subtly expands the band's sonic palette without overwhelming the band's appealing simplicity. The sweeping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14145-20-days-20-nights/"" target=""_blank"">""20 Days and 20 Nights""</a> takes a melancholic turn via a wistful piano solo, while the moody folk-pop tune ""Executioner's Song"" culminates with a surprisingly expressive horn section. The sinister lo-fi side of the group's personality displayed on its 7""s and 2009's spooky <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13507-grey-eyed-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Grey-Eyed Girls</a></i> has been sublimated. For now, Cohen is playing up the poppiest aspects of his band's sound, occupying the space once owned by the Shins on <i>Oh, Inverted World</i> and <i>Chutes Too Narrow</i>. With <i>Long Slow Dance</i>, he's made a record for blissfully happy nights.</p></div>"|16992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16992-long-slow-dance/|7.6|Steven Hyden

It was a record easily lumped in with the garage punks-- any lyrics that seemed to come from a personal place were overshadowed by their raucous delivery and big, infectious choruses. That's not the case with <i>The Garden of Joy and the Well of Loneliness</i>, the brainchild of Harlem's Michael Coomer. It's an album where every song tells a vulnerable story with lyrics that pulsate with insecurities, breakups, sex, and love. Those factors seem to be the driving forces behind <a href=""http://lacecurtainsband.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lace Curtains</a>.</p>
<p>Storytelling is definitely one of Coomer's greatest strengths here. ""Candy says"", he sings on ""High Fantasy"", perhaps invoking that familiar <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEVyf6y_-Y4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Candy who's come to hate her body</a>. He continues, ""'Stop writing songs about me/ I'm not to be taken literally/ I don't need anyone seeing my laundry written into a song.'"" The central character is tired of having her hang-ups, image, and stories reflected in some dude's lyrics. It's a song that could feasibly be sung from the perspective of the Velvet Underground's character, but by the end of the track, Coomer cries out, ""Alexis."" It's a name wailed without context but one that's loaded with emotionally resonant, deeply personal implications. And every song offers a glimpse at small, seemingly telling moments, as in ""Sadie Hawkins"", where he slow dances with a chaperone and decries his own lack of poise and mop of hair.</p>
<p>If a feeling of tenderness pervades, it's only encouraged by Coomer's equally tender guitar. ""Grey"", ""High Fantasy"", ""Sadie Hawkins"", and ""Cute Black Cloud"" feature soft, unassuming-but-memorable melodies. But if all this talk of feelings and soft guitars makes the album sound fey or devoid of any rock'n'roll punch, that's not the case. Throughout <i>Garden</i>, Coomer contrasts his observations and ponderings with driving, pop-oriented instrumentals. Most of the album's songs, including the four listed above, are bolstered by drum work from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/571-bloc-party/"" target=""_blank"">Bloc Party</a>'s Matt Tong, a longtime friend of Coomer's. One of the album's best songs, ""Cleopatra"", is a choogling, semi-improvised jam that finds Coomer singing about people he met in Northwest Houston with a cadence that's equal parts J. Spaceman and Lou Reed.</p>
<p>Most of the source material in <i>Garden of Joy</i>'s lyrics are relatable moments-- feeling self-conscious at the school dance, listening to records with somebody special, exploring the blurry line between platonic and romantic relationships. But some of the album's lyrical highlights are its weirder lines. Here's a description of endearment from ""Police Brutality"": ""Baby fat still hung on your cheeks like a lil' JonBenét."" That same song dips into some fairly graphic imagery later on, so clearly, his sense of humor from those Harlem records (and his <a href=""https://twitter.com/HarlemWhateverr"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">often hilarious Twitter account</a>) isn't lost in the album's introspective tendencies. Still, there's a sweetness to the line, ""I like the sound you make learning to play the drums.""</p>
<p>Every name, reference, and symbol in the album seems to point to something fragile. The album is named for both a gay-friendly bar in 1930s Harlem and a 1920s lesbian novel, furthering the ""behind closed doors"" mindset. The cover features a portrait of Marilyn Monroe. There's a reference to Cleopatra's suicide, which clearly holds some significance to Coomer (from <a href=""https://twitter.com/lacecurtains/status/230711684925370369"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lace Curtains' Twitter account</a>: ""today is the anniversary of the defeat of mark antony by octavian leading to the eventual suicide of cleopatra. also my record is on itunes""). Even the name ""Lace Curtains"" implies getting a glimpse at a private moment. And that's what this album deals in: Unsure feelings. Memories. Skin. In tone, execution, and tender demeanor, it's definitely a far cry from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12891-free-drugs-/"" target=""_blank"">Free Drugs;-)</a></i>.</p></div>"|17143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17143-the-garden-of-joy-and-the-well-of-loneliness/|7.5|Evan Minsker

The irony here is that this is perhaps the first Minerva record where you can understand everything she's singing. Her aesthetic is aqueous, intimate, and intentionally murky; her songs sound like an after-after-hours DJ set at a disco that happens to be inside a seldom-cleaned aquarium. Unlike the intimate, rough-hewn <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15871-cabaret-cixous/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cabaret Cixous</i></a>, which she put together in her bedroom, <i>Happiness</i> was recorded in a proper studio, but that doesn't mean Minerva's suddenly courting a larger audience. That line quoted above? It's from a song called ""I Don't Wanna Be Discovered"", and with its enchanting, kaleidoscopic loops; thumping, muffled beat (which sounds like something overheard through a neighbor's wall); and cheeky sloganeering (""How do you explain to people that you don't really care?""), it's probably the closest she's come yet to writing her own theme song.</p>
<p>Minerva's a laptop vagrant, and her music knowingly cultivates a world where ongoing Pro Tools projects and familiar keystrokes (there was a song on <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15871-cabaret-cixous/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cabaret Cixous</i></a> called ""I Luv Ctrl"") give off the most consistent sense of home. On a break from working on her thesis at London's Goldsmiths University, Estonian-born Minerva (real name: Maria Juur) recorded <i>Happiness</i> while she was living temporarily in Lisbon. But as self-consciously digital-minded as her music is, she isn't so much interested in replicating the antic maximalism of the world around her as she is in trying to create deep grooves that provide escape and transcendence. It works, sometimes: Though <i>Cabaret Cixous</i> wasn't a particularly inviting record, Minerva hit a sweet spot last year with her entrancing <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16079-maria-minerva-sacred-profane-love-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sacred &amp; Profane Love</i></a> EP. Her prolificacy also seems intricately connected to her digital-friendly aesthetic (she's been making music for only two years but has already put out half a dozen releases on L.A.-based imprints 100% Silk and Not Not Fun), though it occasionally works to her disadvantage. All but her very best songs feel somewhat half-baked, ideas that could have amounted to more were they given a little more time to develop.</p>
<p>Minerva's music remains an acquired taste, and <i>Will Happiness Find Me?</i> is not a record to convert people who've been put off by her stuff in the past. Still, it's noticeably clearer in its vision than anything she's put out before. <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13896-the-sound/"" target=""_blank"">""The Sound""</a> and ""I Don't Wanna Be Discovered"" are both immersive, evocative, and confident, and closing track ""The Star"" marks maybe Minerva's most interesting use of sampling yet, as she exhales a countermelody atop a looping, vaguely eerie piece of the Chordettes' ""Mr. Sandman"". The track's faded glamor complements her aesthetic well, though the same can't be said of Chase Royal's stilted verse on the misstep <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14139-fire-ft-chase-royal/"" target=""_blank"">""Fire""</a>. On a record that's otherwise so intimate and personal, his voice feels like an awkward intrusion.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a conscious and built-in awkwardness to Minerva's music, and as the DIY-or-die anthem ""I Don't Wanna Be Discovered"" attests, she intends this to be one of its charms. Still, with each subsequent release something about this approach becomes a little more frustrating. The best song on <i>Cixous</i> was ""Ruff Trade"", which communicated the same themes-- desire, control, and the temptation of ""selling out""-- as the rest of the record, but the straightforward hook gave it a certain immediacy that her music usually shies away from. Keeping her project this intimate has its virtues, for sure, but how much better might Minerva be, you can't help but wonder, if she were actually trying to be discovered?</p></div>"|17019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17019-will-happiness-find-me/|6.9|Lindsay Zoladz

By all measurable standards, this is Animal Collective's golden age: Their last album, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/"" target=""_blank""><i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i></a>, capped a remarkable decade-long journey that saw the band evolve from psych-folk recording project to top-billed digi-pop tweakers. But their popularity hasn't made them any more populist. Even as their songs have grown more melodically and emotionally accessible, their music has grown ever more indefinable. Theirs is the rarest, most enviable form of success: one born not of conforming to audiences' expectations but of constantly confounding them. Avey's refutation of his golden age suggests that, for Animal Collective, happiness is a function of never feeling fully satisfied with what you've accomplished, and continually challenging yourself.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the Animal Collective discography has that sense of unease felt so pronounced as on <i>Centipede Hz</i>. The band's latest album is to <i>Merriweather</i> as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10650-strawberry-jam/"" target=""_blank""><i>Strawberry Jam</i></a> was to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/193-feels/"" target=""_blank""><i>Feels</i></a>-- the anxious flipside to an ecstatic predecessor. But its execution is even more relentless. Animal Collective have always embraced a certain back-to-nature ethos, but <i>Centipede Hz</i> is noticeably urban in feel. Beyond the references to their native Baltimore, these bustling songs are tied together by radio broadcast snippets and ad samples that feel very much like a comment on 21st-century sensory overload (an experience presaged by the band's own <a href=""http://www.radio.myanimalhome.net"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent experiences as free-form radio hosts</a>). Even the album cover looks like an interstitial from U2's Zoo TV multimedia blitzkrieg.</p>
<p>With multi-instrumentalist Deakin re-joining the band after a four-year hiatus, they've never before hit with such blunt force. The rippling rhythms and aquatic ambience of <i>Merriweather</i> is displaced by industrial-strength ballast: Lead-off track ""Moonjock"" announces itself with a morse-code crunch that could practically pass for Sleigh Bells, while stuttering lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13955-todays-supernatural/"" target=""_blank"">""Today's Supernatural""</a> closes with the sort of drum-set-toppling flourish that arena-rock acts use to stretch out their last encore. These songs get <i>Centipede Hz</i> off to a deliriously disorienting start, showcasing the band's ability to coax sing-song melodies out of a melee. But as the album progresses, it becomes increasingly apparent that <i>Centipede Hz</i>'s over-caffeinated energy comes at the expense of what, for all their restless creativity, has always been Animal Collective's greatest virtue-- their patience.</p>
<p>From <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/191-sung-tongs/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sung Tongs</i></a>' ""Kids on Holiday"" and <i>Feels</i>' ""Banshee Beat"" to <i>Strawberry Jam</i>'s ""Fireworks"" and <i>Merriweather</i>'s ""My Girls"", Animal Collective's greatest moments have conveyed a shared sense of discovery. There's a sense of something special being slowly revealed, of chaotic rhythms, harmonies, and atmospheres gradually cohering into glorious moments of clarity before dissolving into the ether. <i>Centipede Hz</i>, by comparison, feels like someone throwing a burrito on your windshield: The songs hit with a jolt, instantly splaying all their ingredients before you.</p>
<p>The result feels overly busy and static at the same time. And the songwriting here can't always keep pace amid all the percussive clatter and synth-noise splatter jacked up in the mix, the melodic through-lines of ceaselessly twitchy tracks like ""Mercury Man"" and ""Applesauce"" getting lost in the whirr. The two contributions from Panda Bear, in particular, underwhelm: ""Rosie Oh"" is another future-shocked Beach Boys fantasia in the vein of <i>Strawberry Jam</i>'s ""Chores"", but comes to an abrupt, unsatisfying end; the more downcast ""New Town Burnout"", originally written for his dubwise 2011 solo release <i>Tomboy, </i>is too sluggish and distant to touch the heights of his best Animal Collective songs. And while Deakin's oscillating reverie ""Wide Eyed"" now makes more sense as a more straightforward mid-album breather than it did as the opening song at the band's main-stage Coachella set last year, his conversational vocal style doesn't have enough character to carry the five-minute song.</p>
<p>Animal Collective have enjoyed a remarkable creative and popular ascent, the sort of trajectory that is almost impossible to sustain in perpetuity. With <i>Centipede Hz</i>, Animal Collective have delivered a cluttered, abrasive album that confirms their naysayers' exaggerated perceptions of the band. But even a patchy Animal Collective album yields several exceptional songs. Beyond the bracing ""Moonjock""/""Today's Supernatural"" double shot, there's the magnificent ""Monkey Riches"" (featuring the lyric quoted at the top of this review), where Avey's increasingly exasperated vocal syncs perfectly with the surging, tribal funk.</p>
<p>The resplendent closer ""Amanita"" arrives with a fanfare fit for a king but also questions its ostentatious surroundings: ""What have we done, what have we done,"" Avey and Panda sing in unison, ""Fantasy is falling down."" It's a song that seems to acknowledge Animal Collective's unlikely position as a mainstream-breaching phenomenon, before busting open an escape hatch from a world of scrutiny and expectation. As it shifts into its giddy, double-timed denouement, Avey excitedly chants, ""What are you gonna do/ Go into the forest/ Until I can't remember my name!"" After pushing their maximal, strobe-lit aesthetic to fatiguing extremes, perhaps a retreat back into the wild is just what Animal Collective need.</p></div>"|16980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16980-centipede-hz/|7.4|Stuart Berman

They labor to sound fresh not just from album to album or track to track, but within songs, measures, and even from one note to another. When I first heard the title <i>Breakup Song</i>, I guessed that it might refer not to the end of a relationship, but to the band's relentless drive to fracture its tunes-- to chop hooks and split beats in hopes of dodging expectations.</p>
<p>It's a risky tactic, because when surprise is this constant, it can create its own predictability. And while the shock of the new is often exciting, the whiplash of endless novelty can also wear you down. For me, the last few Deerhoof albums have tilted toward sonic exhaustion. But <i>Breakup Song</i> is a nice swing in the other direction. It's a quick, pithy album, with 11 songs lasting just 30 minutes. There are patches of tedium, but the best moments are both surprising and engaging.</p>
<p>Many of those moments come in an opening four-song head-rush. There's a lot of nervy sound going on in these tunes, with chords, rhythms, and electronic blips and whirrs darting around the stereo space. But the tone is breezy and fun, with beats that are oddly danceable (""Now I am going dancing/ If you would care to join me,"" sings Satomi Matsuzaki at one point) and synths that hint at 1980s pop. On the bouncing ""There's That Grin"", Matsuzaki repeatedly begs, ""Not all at once,"" and the band obeys for a bit. But they happily rebel on the next track, ""Bad Kids to the Front"", a mini-tornado of ping-pong bleeps and pop-up riffs.</p>
<p>When Deerhoof dip down from those peaks, it's usually due to lulls in energy. Songs that attempt longer grooves sometimes settle into them rather than pushing or pulling at them. Still, the music is rarely formulaic. The occasional flatness comes from Matsuzaki's singing style. Her tendency to stick to a narrow set of colors and patterns-- the same sunny notes, staccato breaths, and see-saw cadences-- can be perfect when the band is swirling frantically around her. But when the music needs a starker counterpoint, her consistency is a drawback. Take ""Flower"", in which her up-down chant of the empty ""Let it go/ Leave it all behind"" sounds stale. Or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13964-the-trouble-with-candyhands/"" target=""_blank"">""The Trouble with Candyhands""</a>, where yet another up-down chant, ""Then you bring me flowers,"" pales next to a marimba-like synth riding the same melodic line. It makes me wonder if someone with a looser, more impulsive style-- say <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"" target=""_blank"">the Fall</a>'s Mark E. Smith or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2986-magik-markers/"" target=""_blank"">Magik Markers</a>' Elisa Ambrogio-- might fare better with Deerhoof's more repetitive jams.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are many times on <i>Breakup Song</i> where only Matsuzaki will do. My favorite is a three-minute sprint with the telling title ""We Do Parties"". Here, drummer Greg Saunier's spindly beat--always the spine of any Deerhoof tune-- weaves a breakneck hybrid of post-punk blast, off-kilter prog, and guitars that evoke the soundtrack of an old Nintendo game. In the middle of it all, Matsuzaki sings about jangletrons, love machines, and something called an ""Autojubilator."" It's fitting imagery for <i>Breakup Song</i>'s charms: hard-working mechanics programmed to entertain.</p></div>"|16993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16993-breakup-song/|7.2|Marc Masters

On ""Reunion"", a highlight from 2004's career high <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7472-set-yourself-on-fire/"" target=""_blank""><i>Set Yourself on Fire</i></a>, Torquil Campbell's pitiful narrator looks back at his teenage years and pleads for the chance to return to those days to fix a broken relationship (but, primarily and somewhat selfishly, ""to be young and wild and free""). ""Ageless Beauty"" from the same album attempts to bottle eternity as Amy Millan steadily consoles, ""Time will hold its promise/ We will always be a light.""</p>
<p>Words like ""today"" and ""tonight"" are thrown around liberally in the band's lyrics, but <i>The North </i>is steeped in nostalgia. This time, they seem to be looking back on the first half of their career, which found them upping the ante with every album (2001's electro-cosmopolitan <i>Nightsongs</i>, 2003's sentimental <i>Heart</i>, the sweeping bombast of <i>Set Yourself on Fire</i>) before overstuffing themselves with haughty pretension (2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10518-in-our-bedroom-after-the-war/"" target=""_blank""><i>In Our Bedroom After the War</i></a>) and getting lost in their own half-formed ideas (2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14349-the-five-ghosts/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Five Ghosts</i></a>).</p>
<p>The opener, ""Theory of Relativity"", announces itself with the same type of crackly, sampled audio that so memorably kicked off ""Your Ex-Lover Is Dead"". The album's closer, ""Walls"", features a bit about how ""We were children/ We danced to 'Hand in Glove'"", a not-so-subtle reminder that the band has ably covered not one, but <i>two</i> Smiths songs over the years. Stars apparently want to return to a headier, more naive time. But what's remarkable about <i>The North</i> is how unforced it sounds while conjuring the ghosts of past glories. It unspools pleasantly and unhurriedly, possessing the sort of sparkly glow that often comes with rejuvenation.</p>
<p>One of the main problems with <i>In Our Bedroom After the War</i> was how ham-handed its conceptual narrative was (Torquil Campbell, after all, has had quite a bit of success as a stage actor too, and he will never, <i>ever</i> let you forget it). Despite Campbell's worrying claims that <i>The North</i> is a vaguely political album-- one only has to throw on ""He Lied About Death"" to remind oneself how irrefutably shitty he is at writing ""political"" songs-- there's really not a noticeable grand theme here. But then, Stars are a band that have been capable of solid songcraft even at their lowest moments.</p>
<p>The album's sense of purpose means that there's plenty of room for the band to experiment, and the sonic playfulness on <i>The North</i> makes for an engrossing, repeatable listen. At first, the title track's shuffling duet is well-worn territory, right down to the lyrics about sleep being ""my friend/ And my rival""-- and then, a bunch of soft, woozy synths slowly roll in, adding a slight layer of disorientation to the song's steady axis. ""Do You Want to Die Together?""'s push-and-pull 1950s rock motif is a textbook example of how tension should function in songwriting (not to mention the latest submission for what should be one hell of a Greatest Hits for these guys), while ""The 400"" takes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"" target=""_blank"">Death Cab for Cutie</a>'s ""Transatlanticism"", shrinks it down, and fills the surrounding space with sparse guitar noise. As with <i>The Five Ghosts</i>, it's Millan who grabs the real highlights here, with the ""Ageless Beauty""-in-reverse ""Backlines"" (which, at points, smacks of UK boy band One Direction's giddy head-rush ""What Makes You Beautiful"") and the brittle, winding tartness of ""Progress"".</p>
<p><i>The Five Ghosts</i> was Stars' dullest and most unfocused work, an album so weak you had to wonder if Stars were done. But with <i>The North</i>, they've exceeded expectations. They may never achieve the youthful immortality they so often sing about, but it's nice to know that they're not dead just yet, either.</p></div>"|16975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16975-the-north/|6.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

Sound familiar? Ambient house institution <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"">the Orb</a> made its most engaging album in years by meeting Pink Floyd's David Gilmour on his own intimately spacey turf for 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14692-metallic-spheres/""><i>Metallic Spheres</i></a>. Now Orb linchpin Alex Paterson and German techno mortician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1472-thomas-fehlmann/"">Thomas Fehlmann</a>, a frequent member since the mid-1990s, rerun the scenario with another living legend on <i>THE ORBSERVER in the star house</i>, producing even fresher-- if not revolutionary-- results. Rather than embalming past glories or forcing a big statement, the Orb sound like they're having fun on these jams, recorded quickly in Berlin, with pioneer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"">Lee ""Scratch"" Perry</a>. On our end, the feeling is mutual.</p>
<p>Let's be honest-- this thing could easily have come out as an interstellar train wreck of piling echoes and filter snaps, as can happen when dub is built by addition rather than subtraction. But the Orb gesture at the Black Ark Studios aesthetic with panache and restraint. Working at the seam where four-on-the-floor house and offbeat reggae complementarily zip together, Paterson and Fehlmann feed Perry lots of grimy, bounding funk patterns and muscular bass, demonstrating how the difference between European dance music and Jamaican riddim can amount to one pumped-up chord flashing urgently on the upbeat. With dub as a lodestar rather than a limit, the disc has a lot of different tones, even getting into American rap territory on two gritty highlights. With the surety of an expert assembling a rifle, ""Go Down Evil"" clicks together around a nervous frame of synthesizer and then falls out of tune like a vintage RZA track. The restive bassline and whispering snaps of ""Man in the Moon"" sound like something Lil Wayne would have weirdly crushed circa <i>Da Drought 3</i>.</p>
<p>""I'm not a rapper,"" Perry modestly disclaims after lacing ""Man in the Moon"" with a lightly tripping patois, but there is something Wayne-like-- if much gentler and quieter-- in his free associative approach to vocalization here. From Perry flows a long river of sung and muttered thoughts and images, wending through scenery both monotonous and sublime at its own patient pace. The lyrics mingle rocksteady boilerplate, sensual insights, pragmatic advice, and exuberant nonsense. Perry wants to take us ""higher, higher."" He sagely counsels that ""hearing is a feeling"" and, to cover the practical side of things, ""if you're thirsty, drink some water."" He looks at stars and thinks about the pace of God. He lets us know exactly what he can do: ""What I can do, puh-pooh, puh-poo-poo, and I can coo-ca-coo."" Low-key almost to a fault, he responds most animatedly to tracks with a lot of fluid changes and sounds a little lost amid stasis, as when riding out the endless slabs of humped bass in the repetitive ""H.O.O."".</p>
<p><i>THE ORBSERVER in the star house</i> has an unfettered vitality that is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15996-lou-reed-metallica/"">not always achieved</a> when legends from different genres meet in the studio, though self-reverence rears its head on occasion. Deep cut ""Police and Thieves"" is a lukewarm reggae shuffle that makes the record feel like it's running out of steam, even though it's a modern take on a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQriZQbTcjk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">classic Perry production</a> for Junior Murvin. ""Golden Clouds"" is a callback of the 1991 Orb classic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHixChYgGRI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Little Fluffy Clouds""</a>, beginning with the same question, ""What were the clouds like when you were young?"" On the original, it was answered by a wide-eyed Ricky Lee Jones over music of crystalline euphoria. Here, a meteorological report from Perry pairs with a grainy swirl of acoustic-sounding strings and kit drums, shaggily rococo like a Villalobos contraption. There is a hint of disillusionment in the change of perspective: Where the clouds were once symbols of childlike wonder, now they're just clouds. But it also speaks of a group who is living in the present rather than the past, an encouraging sign of good things to come.</p></div>"|16978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16978-the-orbserver-in-the-star-house/|6.8|Brian Howe

It became such a popular and usefully evocative phrase that by the time his publisher issued an updated paperback edition in 2011, the original title had been dropped altogether in favor of the popular quote. In his new introduction, Marcus notes the change and remarks that ""The Old, Weird America"" was his original title for book, although it was rejected by both his U.S. and UK publishers. He also writes that the term may have been overused in the intervening decade: ""It became a catchphrase, most often floating free of any source or attribution, as if it were itself a piece of some nineteenth-century folk song."" It took on a life of its own, mutating with each use until it came to mean something distinctly different and distant from its original denotation, used to describe an array of acts who rarely ventured so self-consciously in the past.</p>
<p>""The old, weird America"" implies not only a pre-rock or a pre-War regionalism, but primarily a world that existed before the industry made recordings widely available, one comprising musical communities where techniques and eccentricities sprung up outside of pop-cultural concerns. It's an attractive idea, one that today promises a safehaven for misfit artists eager to distinguish themselves from current pop-music trends. Never mind that early 20th-century musicians traveled widely, traded ideas with contemporaries, learned new tricks, and aspired to something like fame. Today ""the old, weird America"" has become a self-conscious genre that overlaps with Americana, indie rock, and the darker corners of country music. Certain ideas have become attached to the phrase, which means that it has become shorthand for a kind of commercial independence and creative authenticity that its first practitioners were never concerned with in the first place.</p>
<p>The duo <a href=""http://www.twogallants.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Two Gallants</a> have always played up this ""old, weird America"" connection self-consciously and studiously, yet there is very little that is old about the rough-edged indie metal on their fourth album, <i>The Bloom and the Blight</i>-- at least not ""old"" in the sense of Dock Boggs or Harry Smith's record collection. Nor are they exactly weird. Guitar player and chief songwriter Adam Stephens deploys gothic imagery of public hangings and apocalyptic riders, not to mention liberal references to the Bible (or at least an abbreviated Bible where Song of Solomon stands in for the entire Old Testament and the Book of Revelations for the entire New). Such an approach is shared by scores of dark Americana acts-- 16 Horsepower, Murder by Death, O'Death, and their ilk.</p>
<p>If Two Gallants' music proves a lot more satisfying than those bands', it's largely because Stephens is less besotted with borrowed profundity. With a voice that at times recalls Sebastian Bach of Skid Row (but in a good way) and a guitar that channels Georgia Satellites by way of Black Sabbath (but in a good way), he writes about public hangings and hell-raisin' alcoholics and dead babies the same way metal bans write about hobbits and demons. At their best, Two Gallants sound like they're just a few aerosol cans away from spraypainting Robert Mitchum on the side of their van.</p>
<p>It's refreshing, on one hand, to hear a band rough up old traditions with shameless metal theatrics on these new songs. ""Ride Away"" stands out as one of the best realizations of their particular aesthetic because it's so shameless in showcasing Stephens' throat-abrading howl, his galloping guitarwork, and Tyson Vogel's thundering drums. With producer John Congleton at the helm highlighting the instrumental interplay between the two musicians, <i>The Bloom and the Blight</i> recalls the Zep boom of the White Stripes or the boogie doom of Dax Riggs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Two Gallants are dead serious about their enterprise, which means the album can sound airless and antiseptic, without the dusty mess and mystery of real history. As with any artist so steadfast, the possibility for self-parody threatens every verse and chorus. Even Leonard Cohen, king of the portentous Bible reference and bookmark-folk spiritual eroticism, would have certainly crossed out the chorus of ""Song of Songs"" and started over: ""The Song of Solomon upon her lips, the light of morning in her eyes,"" Stephens sings. ""The Jordan River in her graveyard hips, you know I'm bound to reach the other side."" </p>
<p>To the extent that Two Gallants succeed, it's mostly due to the rock. Songs like ""Ride Away"" and even ""Cradle Pyre"", despite its ridiculous title, sound big and dramatic and full of import, yet the scorched guitars and pummeling drums are usually so mired in the folk-historical milieu that it's difficult to enjoy them. As a result, despite the drama in the music, there's no sense of real people in these songs, not as artists in the here and now and not as subjects in the there and then. The America of <i>The Bloom and the Blight</i> is strangely uninhabited, a museum diorama obscured by a Do Not Touch sign.</p></div>"|17020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17020-the-bloom-and-the-blight/|5.5|Stephen M.

Ten years is a long time for sour grapes to ferment, and I hope they're delicious. Perhaps you've heard that we were not particularly kind to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/93-andrew-wk/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew W.K.</a> the first time around. I obviously disagree with Ryan Schreiber's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/184-i-get-wet/"" target=""_blank"">initial assessment</a>, but even if it weren't poor form to publicly air out your boss for opinions he held a decade prior, I'm in no position to judge. I, too, am trying to live down an equally regrettable (if far more obscure) review of <i>I Get Wet </i>for a student newspaper that went in the completely opposite direction, praising it not so much for its musical value as its ability to combine with Adderall and Keystone Ice to form an outgoing college senior's Holy Trinity of nihilistic intoxication. It was and is a record that inspires extreme reactions. And a lot of us seemingly did <i>I Get Wet</i> a great disservice trying to intellectualize it from both sides. Now here we are 10 years later and nothing has changed about the record except our relationship to it. Even though critics of Andrew W.K.<i> </i>were often branded as the fun police and his fans considered fools or incurable ironists, <i>I Get Wet</i> is a singular record, and your opinion of it can't possibly make a larger point about anything else. It just <i>is.</i></p>
<p>It was one of the last great bizarre major label experiments. Coming at a time when the New Rock Revolution was meant to depose nu-metal, it was staunchly anti-intellectual, undeniably a commercial flop, and yet, you've heard it nearly everywhere. A full decade later, Andrew W.K. maintains enough pop culture juice to end up on TV with striking frequency. Musically, <i>I Get Wet</i> started no trends and<i> </i>influenced no one. It's often scoffed at as one of the dumbest records ever made, but I've heard equally compelling and cogent arguments comparing it to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>'s <i>Discovery </i>in how its treats euphoria as an actual musical genre.</p>
<p>It is not a work of fascinating contradictions, deceptive layers, or idiot savant genius. But do you want to turn a record whose first song is called ""It's Time to Party"" into an academic work? Many, including Andrew W.K. himself, have tried to frame ""party"" as a metaphorical device or a Zen philosophy, but come the fuck on: It does nothing new in any technical sense if you've been in a basketball arena at any point in your life. And still, the only response to hearing the initial detonation of guitars, kick drums, and fake orchestra hits from ""It's Time to Party"" is, ""What the fuck <i>is </i>this<i>?</i>"" Or to backflip into a kegstand, after which the next 90 seconds should not be spent around any breakable or flammable home furnishings. ""Party Hard"" is the next song and upon first exposure, the two may seem like the five greatest minutes of music you've ever heard. </p>
<p>Whether you consider these songs to be brilliant, brilliantly dumb, or just dumb, <i>I Get Wet </i>is necessarily simple. Though placed in the lineage of hair metal, there's almost no technical flash, no power ballads, not even a single minor chord. The trickiest modulation happens on the chorus to ""Girls Own Love"", which may or not just be a <i>Hysteria </i>deep cut played at twice the speed. The vocal harmonies of ""Party Hard"" are stacked so thick that the melody barely moves, making it the easiest and <i>best</i> karaoke song ever. Even if ""Party Hard"" had lyrics about anything else, it would still be a keg-rock legend based on its riffs alone-- they're the four best on <i>I Get</i> <i>Wet</i>,<i> </i>which makes them the four best of that year. But unlike those from, say, <i>White Blood Cells</i>, they just sound <i>wrong </i>banged out on one guitar. The impossible number of vocal and guitar overdubs on ""Take It Off"" pushes it beyond even shoegaze incomprehensibility. You simply can't divorce the sensational effect of <i>I Get Wet </i>from its emotional one, and the music truly is the message: ""It's Time to Party"" immediately triggers <i>I Get Wet</i>'s enduring effect, the same pit-in-the-stomach feeling of boarding a roller coaster, asking someone out, or looking at your bank account after a particularly brutal weekend. It's thrilling, it's nauseating, there's no going back.</p>
<p>But while <i>I Get Wet </i>is the perfect Andrew W.K. album, it's in no way a perfect album. For one thing, there are the songs that actually try to make some sort of coherent statement and could <i>potentially </i>take on some sort of post-9/11 relevance (""I Love NYC"", ""Ready to Die""). But they thrash about as blissfully unaware as ""Party Hard"" because they make <i>absolutely no sense</i>. Many hear <i>I Get Wet </i>as a record of unintentional comedy, but ""I Love NYC"" falls into the realm of <i>intentional </i>comedy because I don't even think it's about New York City. Or <i>any </i>city. ""She Is Beautiful"" and ""Girls Own Love"" are both hilariously bereft of any kind of eroticism, women viewed as mere vessels for expressions of male lust and yet beyond all comprehension. They're songs Barbie and Ken might fuck to. Point being that, for an album that supposedly steamrolls any talk of nuance, it has some pretty mundane issues. And the second half<i> </i>is much weaker than the first. If you don't believe me, ask anyone who's shown up to the <i>I Get Wet </i>10-year anniversary shows 20 minutes late. (Dude loves to party but he's remarkably punctual.)</p>
<p>Part of that is inevitable since any record that starts with ""It's Time to Party"" and ""Party Hard"" doesn't leave much room to build on an upward trajectory. But while ""Party Til You Puke"" is the culmination of <i>I Get Wet</i>'s ""Party"" trilogy, it's also the tipping point where the thought of past, present, or future partying becomes unbearably oppressive. The sheer velocity of its call and response vocals renders it a monolithic yell of ""CHUG,"" and immediately afterwards, ""Fun Night"" is that guy handing you a rally beer at the toilet when all you can say is ""not now, <i>bro</i>."" ""Got to Do It"" is ""Girls Own Love"" seen through the eye of a tiger, and though I've owned this record for nearly a decade, to this day I still can't remember what the title track sounds like. To its credit, ""Don't Stop Livin' in the Red"" is pretty much the only way this record could end, and it's nice to see it get him some <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZDHt_-8png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Target ad</a> money even though it's almost impossible to imagine its, um, suggestive cover appearing in the superstore's sales racks. So I suppose there's irony <i>somewhere </i>in all this.</p>
<p>As far as the reissue goes, it's worth exploring whether or not you're amongst Andrew's white-denimed minions. There's a batch of live tracks that are curiously and intentionally recorded in a way that Andrew W.K. once described to me as what <i>he </i>hears when he's on stage. I'd say the demos and alternate takes are far more intriguing since the idea of <i>I Get Wet </i>ever existing as demos is hilarious-- just imagine Andrew W.K. hunched over an acoustic guitar trying to finish ""We do what we like…"" with the right lyric. </p>
<p>If you're 20 years old and haven't heard <i>I Get Wet </i>yet, go ahead and enjoy it while you can. But I won't convince you that it <i>matters</i> in a larger sense even though the ostensible goal of any reissue, particularly in the case where the original isn't out of print, is to edify or reassess. That's unnecessary with <i>I Get Wet</i>. Not much Andrew W.K. did or could do after the record would redeem, justify, or vindicate your original opinion of it<i>. </i>About a year and a half after it failed to set the charts ablaze, <i>The Wolf </i>happened, and while it's a perfectly fine record, its value is entirely manifested in its utility for expert-level trolling; surely on a message board somewhere, someone is taking great satisfaction in his opinion that it's <i>better </i>than <i>I Get Wet.</i></p>
<p><i></i>Andrew W.K. did go on to make other records on a much smaller and cultishly followed scale, which was likely meant to happen from day one. In spite of the utter lack of separation between Andrew Wilkes-Krier and his living, breathing party persona, neither appears to have aged a day in the past decade, which perhaps confirms the record's totemic, unyielding nature<i>. </i>Because really, while my life has changed significantly since my first exposure to <i>I Get Wet</i> and<i> </i>I maybe spin this record once a year, I still don't think there's ever been an album that does a better job, while it's actually playing, of convincing me it's the only music I'll ever need for the rest of my life.</p></div>"|16836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16836-i-get-wet/|8.6|Ian Cohen

For his part, Xiu Xiu foundation Jamie Stewart told me earlier this year that the band is how he's mostly organized his emotional life for two decades. ""Not to sound over-dramatic,"" he said sitting in a sandwich shop, ""but Xiu Xiu is totally essential to me getting through life."" Whether in videos doused with vomit, songs chronicling struggles with suicide or sexual slavery, or albums that demand concessions to discomfort, intensity is an inherent quality of Xiu Xiu. As for Larsen's teeming sound worlds, the Torino quintet has previously worked with David Tibet, Michael Gira, and Steven Stapleton, three bandleaders known for the relentlessness of their oeuvres and approaches. On the brilliant 2007 live set <i>ABECEDA</i>, they revealed themselves as an elite instrumental ensemble, able to command an hour onstage with both grace and thunder.</p>
<p>But <i>Düde</i>, the pairing's third full-length released and first since 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10484-spicchiology/"" target=""_blank""><i>¿Spicchiology?</i></a>, comes pleasantly marked by a sense of overriding ease, or at least the feeling that neither act fussed over or fiddled with these songs as much as they might have with their own. The big band-- Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart and Angela Seo, plus all of Larsen-- originally improvised these pieces, rearranged them, and quickly put down the definite versions found here. Less songs per se than largely instrumental structured jams, these pieces seem undecided. ""Absorption"", for instance, feels at first like a workout in Harmonia worship, with tinkling bells and pulsating synthesizers washing into a solid state of reverie. Midway through, though, a chorus of squawking horns cuts in, providing a non sequitur stopgap that has very little to do with the conclusion of skittering noise and jarring guitars and even less to do with the halcyon start. Closer ""Vaire"", the one song Stewart sings here, allows for the kind of excess that he'd likely bowdlerize from his own albums. Before his unmistakably pained voice shows up, the outfit simply decorates the beat with a craggy guitar line, manipulated drum machines, and washes of noise; after he sings a verse, they rupture the beat until it falls apart, a trail of percussion and synthesizer whir following behind the fading pulse. The indulgence gives Stewart's pathos a rare patina of comfort and approachability. That is, if one of Xiu Xiu's chief assets is his urgency, Stewart works quite well in the absence of it, too.</p>
<p>That's symptomatic of XXL's real success on <i>Düde</i>, a record that finds its components pushing each other places they might not necessarily find themselves. They're better for it. The 18-minute ""Oi! Düde"" is a bold, pure sprawl of Krautrock inspiration, XXL building very slowly and indirectly into a climax of noise, drums, and droning tones. ""Krampus"" might not only be the most surprising thing here but also in the collective discography of both Xiu Xiu and Larsen. Drifting in like smoke, it's a ringer for a lost Six Organs of Admittance take, with guitars and oscillators intertwining around a xylophone core. Seo reads in Korean, her distant and diffident tone giving the piece a ghostly charm. It's almost impossible to imagine Xiu Xiu conjuring this much patience, or Larsen this much deliberate melody. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The stylistic tinkering within <i>Düde</i> does make the album feel less like a record and more like a string of ideas, a problem that these bands generally don't encounter on their own. The carnival-like wallop of ""Disco Chrome"" plays like an attempt to make the album something it's not. An instrumental series of pieces share the title ""Film Me in the Laundry Nos. 1-3"" as if to fix that cohesion issue, but that even they can't tie <i>Düde</i>'s 51 minutes into a whole. To that end, these eight pieces feel not like their own, memorable book but more like chapters within the story of an unlikely and consistently interesting collaboration: Two restless bands on different continents converge, successfully shaking off their own aesthetic parameters for bits and pieces of occasional high intrigue. </p></div>"|17014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17014-dude/|6.7|Grayson Currin

Prairie guitars with heavy-thumbed top strings sidestep and shuffle around chirruping synthesizers, sonar-shaky womps, and krautrock plains in a fashion not dissimilar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a>'s more recent releases. However, one of the joys of <i>Django Django</i> is that even though it's rendered in two basic colors-- natural and synthetic-- the scenarios it conjures are significantly more multifaceted.</p>
<p>There's a boyish sense of adventure and emotion to this album. Following a mechanical introduction that sounds like the theme to a 1980s science <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdI_MmN-Lp4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">educational video</a>, ""Hail Bop""'s airless, stabby twang recalls a sci-fi terror sequence-- desperately trying to diffuse a ticking time bomb, or escape a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U3Oti2L8S4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">compressing trash compactor</a>. The ensuing burbling synths, arid Dick Dale-indebted guitar and unpredictable squelches recall the kind of landscapes conjured by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3993-super-furry-animals/"" target=""_blank"">Super Furry Animals</a>, rolling hills perfect for boisterous psychedelic trips, with the conspicuously blankly chanted lyrics set among hillocks and vast skies, too. A potentially romantic figure ""appear[s] from the hillside... a funny look in your eye,"" before darting off again in spite of the onlooker having been ""waiting here so long.""</p>
<p>The scene sets the tone for an album where what appears to be a disintegrating relationship is rarely described in human or adult emotional terms; rather it's as a tricksy <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rube Goldberg</a> device where the parties race to reassemble and disassemble the partnership as part of a game of emotional one-upmanship and obstacle-planting. Former single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12892-default-walls-remix/"" target=""_blank"">""Default""</a> is a wickedly neurotic stompbox-powered chant with voices intermittently gargling and hissing in cuckoo clock rhythm. ""We just lit the fire and now you want to put it out,"" Dave, Vincent, Tommy, and Jimmy chant. ""Take one for the team/ You're a cog in the machine/ It's like a default."" The itchy ""WOR"" starts with a murkily obfuscated motif from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFrDSFzlKwE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Misirlou""</a>, rumbling into a rubbery, lurching funk that sets the pace for another competitive move: ""I took a chance on you and it's time to ring the bell.""</p>
<p>The unrelenting chanted singing style can make Django Django sound a bit sterile and passionless, building to a brassy sheen that defies the eloquent frustration of a song like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13217-storm/"" target=""_blank"">""Storm""</a>: ""You are a storm; you are my little storm/ I watch the wind change to find out where you've been blown."" The group has been lazily compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/339-the-beta-band/"" target=""_blank"">the Beta Band</a>, largely due to their Fife-born drummer and production whizz David Maclean being the younger brother of John Maclean. But whereas that band married Lennon-like vocal calm with bucolic, occasionally piqued backing, Django Django seem more akin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"" target=""_blank"">Hot Chip</a> in approach: a bunch of comparative straights going doolally in a studio, using their dispassionate vocal layering as the foundation from which to paint in entertainingly bold strokes. ""Firewater"", a song about getting legless on booze in the desert, gambols and struts like a drunk precariously skirting the edge of a campfire; ""Skies Over Cairo"" gets weirder, the sound of a Saharan-influenced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a> careering over a huffing rhythm seemingly comprised of samples of recorded water. Despite jangling on past its shelf life, the opening of ""Zumm Zumm"" fizzes and clanks like an ancient fairground attraction, with hyena yaps punctuating oblique exclamations about unexpected, never-before-seen occurrences. </p>
<p>That same sense of vivacity can't be applied to the song that follows it, ""Hand of Man"", whose dull country roughage creaks out beneath a numbed appropriation of the melody from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"" target=""_blank"">the Shins</a>' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTjoidtysUs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""New Slang""</a>. Thankfully, however, <i>Django Django</i> picks up again with ""Love's Dart"", a bandy coconut canter which urges that goals-- romantic or otherwise-- can be more than just a mirage if you keep them firmly in mind. Django Django are bursting with ideas and an intriguing aesthetic that would suggest that their own goals are very keenly defined-- the result of working on this album for over two years, perhaps-- with the artwork's simplicity acting as a red herring to their boundlessly imaginative, considered complexity.</p></div>"|16504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16504-django-django/|7.2|Laura Snapes

The band, which debuted in February on a self-titled 7"", includes the entirety of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9512-unearthly-trance/"" target=""_blank"">Unearthly Trance</a>, a Brooklyn-via-Long Island trio that issued a string of harrowing, unpredictable doom-metal records before disbanding this past July. Bassist Jay Newman and drummer Darren Verni play the same roles in the new group, while Ryan Lipynsky-- a super-prolific guitarist-vocalist also known for his work in black-metal projects such as Thralldom and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16999-of-babalon/"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">the Howling Wind</span></a>-- handles mic duties exclusively. The fresh element here is guitarist Tim Bagshaw, a member of Ramesses, a UK trio that takes stoner metal to nightmarish extremes. (The four met in 2002 when Unearthly Trance toured with Bagshaw's old-band, occult-psych heavyweights Electric Wizard.)</p>
<p>Despite the overlap in personnel, there's a crucial difference between Unearthly Trance and Serpentine Path: While the former band spiked its evil sludge with uptempo hardcore gallops, dark-ambient atmospherics, acoustic interludes, and the occasional melodic bellow from Lipynsky on exemplary statements like 2008's <i>Electrocution</i> and 2010's <i>V</i>, the latter favors a much narrower palette. Serpentine Path fixate on a single sonic idea, a blend of doom- and death-metal practice (the early-90s-era NYC trio Winter, re-formed as of 2011, is one key forebearer) built around Bagshaw's towering slo-mo riffs, Lipynsky's menacing growls, and the odd creepy sample. The result is an admirably streamlined 43-minute LP-- superbly played and recorded-- that thrives on its own monomania.</p>
<p>Opening track ""Arrows"" epitomizes the no-nonsense sturdiness of the Serpentine Path aesthetic. What's impressive here isn't the raw material; the opening sample, a recitation from the Book of Revelation, is straight out of the Ramesses playbook, and Bagshaw's death-blues chug plays like extreme-doom 101. But the sophistication of the delivery-- the way the rhythms hypnotize even as they heave-- is anything but commonplace; it's clear that each musician present is an elite lifer, sworn like a blood brother to the cause of slo-mo heaviness. Darren Verni is the MVP. Here and throughout the record, his taut beats, peppered with tasty snare syncopations, lend an improbable sense of funk to Bagshaw's shaggy riffscapes. The sheer conviction of the performances, coupled with <i>Serpentine Path</i>'s beautifully natural-sounding production job, makes ""Arrows"" feel like a new benchmark in its familiar style.</p>
<p>For listeners accustomed to the wide array of vocal tactics Lipynsky favored with Unearthly Trance-- by the time of <i>V</i>, he was complementing his signature raspy yell with wounded-sounding bellows and gothic moans-- his monochrome delivery on <i>Serpentine Path</i> might seem like a step backward. Yet given the cold intensity of the new project, it's a shrewd choice. Relieved of all melodic duty, Lipynsky approaches his role here as an MC might. On <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13949-crotalus-horridus-horridus/"" target=""_blank"">""Crotalus Horridus Horridus""</a>, a portrait of a rattlesnake attack, he slides in and out of step with the band's lumbering cadences, accenting offbeats and punctuating the end of each verse with a nasty-sounding ""Blechhh!"" Similarly, he marks the climax of ""Bats Amongst Heathens"" with a wretched throat noise, more gargle than scream. Bagshaw too wrings maximum drama out of limited materials. <i>Serpentine Path</i> contains no trace of the eerie, clean-toned moodsetting the guitarist employs on recent Ramesses records like last year's <i>Possessed by the Rise of Magik</i>, but when Bagshaw does go for a flourish, it counts: His howling harmonies on the intro to ""Obsoletion"" offer a hint of sky-kissing psychedelia amid the roiling doom magma.</p>
<p>Modest variations in tempo and texture add intrigue to this staunchly unwavering set. ""Aphelion""-- the shortest and fastest track-- plays like a blast of rock'n'roll hedonism, offsetting the bleak expanse that surrounds it; the song's stomping, call-and-response chorus ought to make it a live favorite if Serpentine Path (<a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2011/11/serpentine_path.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""predominantly a recording project,""</a> <span class=""s1"">in the words of Newman</span>) ever decides to take the stage. In contrast, ""Beyond the Dawn of Time"" is as minimal as doom metal gets this side of early Sunn O))). The song consists of just four sinister chords, which alternate with vast, dizzying rests-- an apt evocation of the cosmic dread Lipynsky describes in the lyrics (""Shadow of eternity draping the earth/ A speck of dust in a desert of humanity""). ""Only a Monolith Remains"", <i>Serpentine Path</i>'s outstanding closer, sums up the record's different strategies, building from a zombified trudge to a writhing, tripped-out shimmy before grinding back down to near stasis, with Verni pounding out a death knell on what sounds like a blacksmith's anvil.</p>
<p>Microscopic diversity aside, <i>Serpentine Path</i> is an unapologetically straightforward statement, one that's either going to sound awesomely monolithic or numbingly monotonous depending on the listener's appetite for extreme doom. But on its own terms, the album is highly successful. Unearthly Trance were a band that always seemed intent on exploring new terrain; Serpentine Path, on the other hand, burrow deep into their chosen niche, nourishing themseves on the soil and growing to hulking size. Lipynsky, Bagshaw, Newman, and Verni make their cramped hovel feel like a universe unto itself.</p></div>"|17025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17025-serpentine-path/|7.4|Hank Shteamer

I know it's not like that for everyone, but it's just how I'm wired. That's why it was such a shock to wake up from a van nap, somewhere along the Georgia interstate, and find my inner eye clouded by crystal-clear images of blood, violence, horror, and death instead of the usual bleary shadows. I'd nodded off with <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/nihillkrach"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nihill</a>'s newest album crackling through my headphones, and as I started awake, was greeted by a chorus of caustic howls still hammering into my eardrums. Lesson learned. Nihill is not a band to turn your back on. </p>
<p>This Dutch outfit may be unfamiliar to most on this side of the pond, but their relentlessly savage take on black metal has been percolating within their native scene since 2007. <i>Verdonkermaan</i> completes a trilogy started with their first release, 2007's <i>Krach</i>, and carried through 2009's <i>Grond</i>, and with this release, the band has fully hit its stride. Opening track ""Vuur: The Deathwind of Resurrection"", is horrific from the onset, bursting straight out the gate with a grating, heavily distorted mélange of black metal and harsh noise. It only gets worse, feeding off its own disgust before pulling the final trigger with one heaving blast of feedback. ""Spiral: The Tail Eater"" is just as uncomfortable a listen: It's the one that gave me nightmares. There is an urgent, disjointed, almost alien quality to the guitar playing. Each hateful riff and mangled chord threatens to collapse into itself, kept dancing on broken glass just above the abyss by nimble fingers and hellish intent. Washes of pure noise spawn from layers upon layers of distorted guitar and bass, propelled by intentionally mechanical drums and narrated by deep, hoarse howls and animalistic snarls. </p>
<p>Comparisons to both recent Blut Aus Nord and vocalist Michiel Eikenaar's other project, Dodecahedron, are apt, but Nihill's commitment to a more feral, unstructured form sets his project with bassist Jelle Agema apart, and gives them room to construct their own identity. If Wold and Sutekh Hexen got their hands on the demos for the last Deathspell Omega LP, they might come up with something close to <i>Verdonkermaan</i>. You've got to hand it to these guys; despite the insanely oversaturated state of modern ""experimental black metal,"" no one else sounds quite like Nihill. The songs are long, at times overwhelmingly so. This isn't funeral doom, or lackadaisical psychedelia; this is a cold, mechanical, brutalizing black metal, created by the kind of minds that surely take pleasure in the suffering its 43 minutes inflict: 10 minutes of punishing black noise is a lot to absorb, and that's just the first song! It works, though. The shortest composition, ""Gnosis Pt. IV"", serves as a respite, ushered in by whispers, as faint metallic clangs and solar winds slowly build beneath them. ""Trauma: Crushing Serpens Mercuriales"" is more understated than its fellows, eschewing the oppressive distortion tactics for a cleaner, simpler approach; still fuzzy, but the tempo plods along until it leaps back into a momentary fever pitch midway through. Nihill like to play with dynamics in an almost malicious way, and keep a listener waiting anxiously for the other jackboot to drop.</p>
<p>This sort of challenging, off-putting black metal has seen an influx of talent within the past few years, and this Dutch band is no exception. Nihill personify the age-old tenets of no mosh, no core, no trend, and definitely no fun. Difficult, unapproachable, and gleefully abrasive, <i>Verdonkermaan</i> will be an addictive but acquired taste for those who seek out the horrendous, the inhumane, and the fucking brutal. Proceed at your own risk.</p></div>"|17063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17063-verdonkermaan/|7.5|Kim Kelly

And yeah, that's unfair. As carefully constructed as the work of any highbrow electronic savant you'd care to name, Deacon's music alone should clearly paint him as a smart dude, a thinker, and a craftsman.</p>
<p>Then again, the music's immediate, bracing surface blare, and the joyful communal whomp of Deacon's live shows, offer something more visceral. It certainly <i>feels</i>, while it's happening, less head-scratch and more belly-laugh. Which gets confusing for swathes of his audience. Apparently certain folks still can't reconcile the ""contradictions"" of an egghead dance-party maniac with an affinity for both systems music and the get-stoopidest jams in history, a guy who'd lovingly deface the memory of Bobby Darin one minute and jump on the furrow-browed krautrock express the next.</p>
<p>True, writers always mention Deacon's serious schooling in art music, as if it weren't obviously the structure holding up his love of noise and bubblegum from every era, even though Deacon's whole career is a testament to swirling highbrow and lowbrow together until it sounds the way a neon spin-art painting looks. If you never bothered to listen, <i>America</i> would seem to be him asserting his composer's chops, what with the thematic scope implied by that damn title, and the tracklist with its four-part closing suite, making it look like a prog-era concept album. And so people have been grumbling, worriedly, that this is where Deacon defangs his art by trying for Art.</p>
<p>Well true, <i>America</i> probably won't appease the short-attention span crowd, but then Deacon's 2009 album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12833-bromst/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bromst</i></a>, was already drifting toward longer durations, more intricate structures, and immersion rather than pop's immediate gratification. But a full-on contemporary experimental composition-type album is not quite what we get here, as if that's inherently a bad thing anyway: <i>America</i> is both Deacon's most expansive album so far, and his most inward-looking.</p>
<p>The first half is an attempt to extend his range as a <i>songwriter</i> beyond jam-master or human freak-out. The second half is his most intricate and involving piece yet, though it's trying hard to be a lot more than a song suite, even a 20-minute one. That first half proves the less successful, though at the same time the opening three-song run may be the best thing Deacon's ever recorded. For all its jittery and hyper-percussive excess, with cartoon-tribal drums the lead voice on ""Guilford Avenue Bridge"" (the breaks of which sound a little like Don Caballero playing a hoedown) and static all but drowning out Deacon's own voice on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13691-lots/"" target=""_blank"">""Lots""</a> (gleeful yelping in search of transcendence), this stuff <i>flows</i>, which is increasingly one of Deacon's great virtues as an album programmer. If his earliest records could feel like various intensities slammed at you until you staggered away dizzy or elated or both, he's grown much more assured at dynamics, bringing you in and taking you along for the ride.</p>
<p>And that opening run's got <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13856-true-thrush/"" target=""_blank"">""True Thrush""</a> stuck in the middle, Deacon's most affecting <i>song</i> so far. Deacon's singing is clear and sad-eyed, though he still can't resist digitally scrunching his voice into computer pixie noises at various points, and he even throws in some angelic back-up harmonies, which make an unselfconsciously beautiful counterpoint to the information-overload of the music. It's the middle of the album that fizzles slightly after the bracing crunch and buzz of the first three songs, which bring new emotional dimensions to Deacon's music without totally skimping on the energy that was his earlier stuff's reason for being. ""Prettyboy"" is gorgeous, undoubtedly, but it's still on the level of really top-shelf video game music.</p>
<p>It's the second half of <i>America</i> that promises and more or less delivers something great and new for Deacon. Where he really shoots off for parts unknown is on ""U.S.A."", the album's finale of four linked pieces. This is not the portrait of America you're probably expecting from the portentous, inclusive sweep of the album's title, one of those Wilson/Parks style attempts to thread many strands of American music, from the conservatory to the vernacular, into a cohesive pop whole. Instead it's more like a musical self-portrait, albeit one on the scale of a Chuck Close painting. It's still recognizably Deacon's work; the ultra-bright buzzsaw textures would probably tip you off even if you were listening blind. It's just his biggest canvas yet.</p>
<p>Way before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10207-spiderman-of-the-rings/"" target=""_blank""><i>Spiderman of the Rings</i></a> hit in 2007, Deacon undertook a half-crazed tour of the whole country via a commercial bus line, just himself and his gear, crisscrossing the Fifty Nifty. That's what I hear on ""U.S.A."": the sound of someone trying to recreate the awe of watching the vastness of the country unfold from the seat of a steadily moving vehicle. So the whole piece moves along to a steady motorik-style pulse, even when the drums drop out. He tosses in some Copland/Ives strings as a kind of emotional thickening agent, but the most prominent influence from the Serious Composers pantheon would be Terry Riley's all-night pieces, where acid rock, early synthesizer blare, and orchestral minimalism fused into one hypnotic feeling of moving forward and standing in place at the same time. Deacon's still got too much pop and rock in him to go the full-on endlessly unfurling route. He's still got climaxes here, in other words, but at the same time the trip's as much about admiring the scenery as taking in the ""wow"" moments.</p>
<p>What <i>America</i> most reminds me of, at least during the second half, is Arthur Russell's orchestral music. Reminds me in <i>spirit</i>, of course, hardly in sound. Because even when Russell was operating in Serious Composer mode himself, there were often strong links to his idiosyncratic-unto-inscrutable takes on disco, folk, pop, etc. But those pieces were still about immersion, oblique narratives that build slowly from the tiniest details, the evocation of distance via duration. So is <i>America</i>, at least in that final stretch. This is still an album of big gestures and arresting noises, but it's also a mistake to come to it expecting the fizzy thrills of <i>Spiderman</i> or even the dark communal playfulness of <i>Bromst</i>. Loosen up on your need for three or four minutes of bottled catharsis, though, and there are some gorgeous vistas to get lost in here, even if, yeah, that means meandering as much as charging forward with frontier spirit.</p></div>"|17094.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17094-america/|7.1|Jess Harvell

Stevie Moore</a> highlighted how often the singer has battled against preconceptions formed about his music. The ""lo-fi"" tag is often attached, even though many of his best recordings purposefully battle against the kind of tape-recorder grime the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"">Guided by Voices</a> deliberately wield as an aesthetic tool. Moore also commented on how little he had in common with ""outsider artists"" with whom he is constantly bracketed, giving a nod to the talents of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4641-wesley-willis/"">Wesley Willis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2202-daniel-johnston/"">Daniel Johnston</a> while highlighting how his skills as an arranger put him in a different league. In fact, as <i>Wire</i> writer Matthew Ingram asks: ""Why is he in the 'weird' camp at all?"" Part of the reason is the 400 or so albums he's released since the late 1960s, coupled with the fact that he's still working at a prodigious rate despite turning 60 earlier this year. Anyone attempting to find an entry point into his work would be forgiven for feeling over-awed by the sheer breadth of it-- something this compilation seeks to address.</p>
<p>Moore was born the son of famed Nashville musician <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Moore"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bob Moore</a>, who counted gigs as a sideman for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22874-elvis-presley/"">Elvis Presley</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8319-jerry-lee-lewis/"">Jerry Lee Lewis</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8321-roy-orbison/"">Roy Orbison</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a> among his towering achievements. His uncle, Harry Palmer, is best known for discovering the ultimate outsider music act, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3751-shaggs/"">the Shaggs</a>. It's difficult to sum up the work of a man with so many recordings to his name, but somewhere between father and uncle lies Moore, pulling in pure pop influences and rinsing them through his off-center take on the world. For a long time it looked like he would be perma-bracketed as a musician's musician, the type of guy feted by other artists but barely known to the outside world. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"">Ariel Pink</a> has been Moore's most famous cheerleader, but dig a little deeper and you'll find collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1439-jad-fair/"">Jad Fair</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4558-mike-watt/"">Mike Watt</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"">MGMT</a> among others. Tim Burgess of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/726-the-charlatans-uk/"">the Charlatans</a>, another former collaborator, has issued <i>Lo Fi High Fives</i> on his <a href=""http://www.ogenesisrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">O Genesis</a> label, making it the latest in a string of compilations (including the Pink-curated <a href=""http://rsteviemoore.bandcamp.com/album/ariel-pinks-picks-vol-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ariel Pink's Picks Vol. 1</i></a> from last year) that attempt to make sense of his greater body of work.</p>
<p>Except, of course, this is a pebble skimming across the surface of that output. There are few signs of Moore's excursions into rap, post-punk, metal, or techno. Instead, the dial twitches between his knowing take on pop and his fondness for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"">Ween</a>-style prankster rock. Sometimes those two worlds collide, most often when Moore draws his audience a little too close to anything that could be marked as ""sentiment."" On ""Find Any"" he sings of being ""sick of singing about girls because I can't find any."" But Moore tempers the feeling by turning the lyric into feeling ""sick of singing about cats because I can't find any,"" complete with screeching ""miaow"" noises. Such lyrical rug-pulls are commonplace in Moore's songs, and may partially explain the disconnect with a wider audience. Just when it feels like you can lean in to get close to him, he's ready with the songwriting equivalent of one of those flowers that clowns use to squirt a jet of water into your eye.</p>
<p>Humor is key to Moore's arsenal, although much of his musical inspiration is drawn from a string of artists who are a lot more at ease with laying themselves bare. The influence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"">Brian Wilson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a> figures prominently on <i>Lo Fi High Fives</i>. ""Here Comes the Summer Again"" is a note-perfect <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">Beach Boys</a> pastiche, while the more impressive ""I Go Into Your Mind"" channels both <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usuu-xu75dI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""In My Room""</a>-style melancholy and the haunted Disney fantasias <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2741-mercury-rev/"">Mercury Rev</a> were chasing circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15393-deserters-songs-deluxe-edition/""><i>Deserter's Songs</i></a>. On the opening <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13944-pop-music/"" target=""_blank"">""Pop Music""</a>, Moore wraps his singular commentary on pop around playing that combines shades of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" with the pomp of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1427-electric-light-orchestra/"">ELO</a> and subtle honky-tonk piano stabs. All of the above help back up Moore's claims for his skills as an arranger, but it's when he steps away from self-consciously aping pop history that his work finds its unique depth. On ""Big Mistake"" he sounds genuinely lost and confused by the world, digging hard into the feeling of being cut adrift from his peers and the public for so long. A yearning for wider acceptance creeps into his most impressive work, a sense that he's drawing on the unusual energy created by releasing song after song into what must have seemed like a total void.</p>
<p>But that's only a fraction of Moore's story, as told by this album's diversions into power pop (""You and Me""), scruffy psychedelia (""Sentimental Ties""), and the hollowed-out Ariel Pink collaboration ""Dutch Me"". What's remarkable about <i>Lo Fi High Fives</i> is how instantly familiar much of this material feels. Partly that's due to Moore's ear for emulating the songwriting techniques of others, but he has a way with song structure and melody that makes it feel like some of this stuff has been floating around in the ether forever. ""Why Should I Love You"" is so brilliantly simple and catchy that it has ""hit single"" written all over it (and, indeed, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBi1g0dczPs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">others</a> have felt the same way). It's hard not to wonder what the cumulative affect this whole process had on Moore's psyche-- Pink wrote some pop gems early in his career (""Helen"", ""Alisa"", ""Every Night I Die at Miyagis"") but subsequently stumbled into success. Moore remains lodged in a gap somewhere between tiny personal victories and an utter failure to connect, and it's in that tension that he produces his best work.</p>
<p>Why are we so drawn to someone like Moore, whose catalog is too vast for even the most ardent fan to fully grasp, who seems intent on throwing myriad curveballs in our path just when we think we're getting to know him? The reason, at least in part, is that it's a disarmingly honest way to operate. Not everyone can go down the route of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3733-sebadoh/"">Lou Barlow</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a>, who were both capable of delving into an alarmingly personal train of thought every time they stepped up to a microphone. Moore has elements of that for sure, but he's also unafraid of coming across as clumsy, confused, perhaps even a little shy. There's value in expressing the feeling that occurs when you pull back from the brink by telling a dumb joke just when you think you've said too much. And Moore has arguably said more than most. Tales of artists who never got their dues are legion, but <i>Lo Fi High Fives</i> does enough to suggest that Moore deserves a place near the top of that particular pecking order. Thankfully, he's still out there. A new album already tucked under his arm. A dreamer, still dreaming.</p></div>"|16959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16959-lo-fi-hi-fives/|7.4|Nick Neyland

Provided with difficult beats by a group of futuristic producers that included Flying Lotus, Diaba$e, and Daedelus, Blu dissected the most complicated sounds, seamlessly slicing through cuts on which most rappers would stumble to land a bar. It was an exciting, esoteric collection. And, for those of us who took Simon Reynolds' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/8010-paper-trail-simon-reynolds/"" target=""_blank"">fear of future-past</a> seriously, it helped to remind us that there will always be something brand new coming around the corner.</p>
<p>Now it's 2012, and if I weren't over my fear of NOTHING NEW HAPPENING IN MUSIC EVER AGAIN, Blu's <i>Give Me My Flowers While I Can Still Smell Them</i> would be a cause for concern. The album was originally put out on bandcamp in December of last year and was marred, as many of Blu's promising records are, by a murk of fuzz and bad mixing so complete that it was basically unlistenable. Now it's back, being released officially by Dirty Science and Fat Beats and while it's newly intelligible, thanks to mastering and mixing, the songs also sound a whole lot like five years ago.</p>
<p>That's partly due to Blu's re-teaming with Exile, who produced the entirety of his classic underground debut <i>Below the Heavens. </i>By reuniting with Exile (who we can thank for the mixing, mastering, and some scratching), Blu makes a return of the sound of his ground floor, to the sweet, contemplative organic soul that had fans embracing him before he started to get really and truly strange in all of the best ways<i>. </i>And though it's tough to criticize a rhymer as fluid as Blu, I can't help but to be disappointed in a release that sounds so much like what came before.</p>
<p>The third track, ""Maybe One Day"", is an example of what's wrong. It's, as always, a showcase for immaculate rapping, as Blu unwinds lines deftly, internal rhymes building and switching on each other with extreme sophistication. But the message of the song is pedantic and reductive as Blu plays the scold, ""I pity them fools, zipping through the city in jewels…/ In it for the Benjamins too, and so am I/ But why would I use it on fool's gold, when you know your true soul shines."" This sentiment, the kneejerk scorn for the heavy flaunting of wealth, is straight out of the mid-naughts backpack rapper's cliché list of complaints. What's more, Blu already flipped the idea on its head a year ago with the half-satirical track ""Everything OK"", on which he both mocks materialism and wishes for more. And he did so over a crazy beat.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most disappointing thing about Blu's step backwards is the way it jars against his newly evolved style. The contemplative beauty of Exile's beats fits Blu's soul-searching perfectly on <i>Below the Heavens. </i>But the rapper has become more versatile and more jagged, stringing individually crafted phrases together so fast that their edges sometimes feel like they're cutting through the headphones. On the devout ""More Out of Life"", what could be a wrathful rant against a squad following false fathers, and looking to ""Malcoms, Martins, Pacs, Chris Wallaces"" is dulled by the elegance of Exile's beat. Blu's anger tamed, the song doesn't have the impact it should and he comes off like a jaded, weary teacher, rolling his eyes at pupils who refuse to absorb a lesson. He even gets lazy at the end, just listing off the things we're dealing with, ""censorship, sponsorship, friendships, relationships, slave ships, minimum wages,"" which is nearly as bad as moaning random words, ""relations, creation, incarceration, determination,"" à la Citizen Cope.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With a rapper like Blu, though, there are always going to be songs that demand repeat listens.  One of the best on the album is ""Growing Pains"", and it's here that Exile unleashes with something a little more dangerous, a heavy beat with a steady melody for cruising downtown avenues. Blu comes through with a minute left and just goes, torrents of syllables coming forward in service of rapid-fire storytelling about pursuing girls, hanging out with his pops, wanting a Casio and riding around in Cadillacs. On ""The Great Escape"" the rapper sounds rejuvenated by the presence of Adad and Homeboy Sandman, the latter of whom is perhaps the only person in independent rap who can twist syllables with the same precision as Blu. </p>
<p>Or take ""The Only One"", on which the man himself relaxes and, still rapping fast as hell, relays explorations of his ancestors and past lives, in between insights into his everyday life. It's his gift for these details, for storytelling and poetry at Wachowski speed that makes Blu such a great rapper. But when you remove bullet time, though he's still formidable, Blu can't hold on to the kinetic excitement that animated <i>No York!.</i></p>
<p>I've always been conflicted about the critical instinct to ask our favorite artists for constant evolution, and it seems particularly unfair to pull out one of Blu's three 2011 releases, point to it as being representative of ""the future,"" and beg for more. But Blu has a loyal legion of fans who will stick up for him, and he could stand to be called out. Making albums like <i>Give Me My Flowers While I Can Still Smell Them</i> is child's play for two guys as talented as he and Exile are.<i></i> And though this album is a beautiful, well-executed listen, Blu will only really be fulfilling his potential when he starts looking toward the future again. </p></div>"|17017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17017-give-me-my-flowers-while-i-can-still-smell-them/|6.8|Jonah Bromwich

I think they have an underrated sense of humor sometimes. Get past that story about the time they swear they saw Big L at the Pathmark, and they'll likely wax nostalgic about guys like Drag-On, Shabaam Sahdeeq, or G. Dep-- benefactors of Big Apple abundance who, seemingly by proximity, came across enough hot beats, killer guest verses, or dope concepts to briefly separate you from $17. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.meyhemlauren.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Meyhem Lauren</a>'s new mixtape <i>Respect The Fly Shit </i>comes at no cost, but it feels like a kindred spirit: as evidenced by its production roster (most of the <i>la musica</i> is provided by Harry Fraud) and guest list (Action Bronson, Heems, Roc Marciano, Sean Price), Lauren has some connection to a lot of what's exciting about New York right now. And <i>Respect the Fly Shit </i>is indeed a fairly enjoyable, even quite good mixtape for reasons that have almost absolutely nothing to do with Meyhem Lauren.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Lauren is hardly a bad rapper, just one without much distinction. He pretty much has one kind of hammerhead flow and sounds winded whenever he has to spit at something quicker than a trudge. He also comes off less like an actual person than a search engine optimization program set to ""New York Rapper"". His first line is, ""I ain't bringin' shit back, New York we never left,"" and within that same verse, he drops phrases like ""hardbody,"" ""hustle hard,"" ""fuck hoes, don't cuff 'em,"" and ""invisibly shook."" He actually reminds me a bit of guys like Sheek Louch, Uncle Murda, or even 2 Chainz, vets who seem more comfortable in the current hip-hop landscape where ""gangsta rappers"" aren't bionic <i>ubermenschen</i>, but rather avid Twitter users and allowed to be goofy enough to appear in on their own joke. With every bullishly delivered threat and headslap of a punchline, Lauren takes a crack at the fourth wall and leaves it open to interpretation as to whether you're supposed to be laughing at him or with him. It's about equal. You can practically see the cartoon lightbulb appearing over his Yankee fitted when he calls his producer ""Harry Embezzlement"" or describing his woman on ""Let's Hold Hands"" in the absolute least erotic terms possible: ""She was the color of an egg bagel/ You know that Simpson complexion/ Her smile caused an instant erection.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I suppose Lauren knows his strengths, though. <i>Respect the Fly Shit </i>is a lean affair, 12 tracks, most of which clock in under three minutes, and it's so chock-full of guest rappers that it can't help but be pretty damn good in spite of itself. Action Bronson's presence looms large over <i>Respect the Fly Shit</i>; he's on about half of it, and most of the titles sound like they could've ended up on his mixtapes anyway (""Pan Seared Tilapia"", ""BBQ Brisket"", ""Grown Man Palettes""). If you have no stake whatsoever in Mayhem Lauren, it's basically a Bronson EP. Still, you see how easy it is for Bronson or just about anyone else here to outclass Lauren. His subject matter is no deeper than that of Lauren's -- quite literally, dude's coming up with some of the hottest verses of 2012 just by talking about what he probably had for lunch-- but his  tremendous flair for outlandish boasts and tricky cadences (rhyming ""peel like an orange"" with ""leather outfit Martin Lawrence,"" etc.) colors his personality from the outside in. Otherwise, Smoke DZA, Despot, and Roc Marciano are in typically strong form, Heems continues to evolve with flows that are simultaneously loopier and rawer, RiFF RAFF crashes the party for reasons known only to RiFF RAFF, and on ""Grown Man Palettes"", Sean Price comes up with one of his best don't-give-a-fuck putdowns: ""Type to tote the glock and use gats/ You the type to vote Barack 'cause dude's black.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Fortunately for Lauren's sake, he gets to outshine some of his peers by default: AG Da Coroner is more or less a zombified take on Meyhem Lauren and quite possibly the most inept ad-libber going, and whether you believe Hologram is raising the stakes or lowering the bar to an inexcusable degree, I'll admit he's at the very least setting <i>new </i>standards for graphic blowjob jokes on ""Top of the World"". (I could tell you how and why he rhymes ""Hot Pocket"" with ""snot rocket,"" but the tape is free; I'll leave it up to you.) Throughout, the beats of Tommy Mas and Harry Fraud are perfectly suited for the roster involved-- they're plush, but not expensive, rugged but not necessarily raw and completely ignoring any sort of radio-rap currency without being stifling ""throwbacks.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It makes <i>Respect the Fly Shit </i>flow effortlessly, though the consistency is more attributable to Lauren himself. You can mix and match any of his verses with these beats without doing much to change the character of any individual song. And that's the issue if you're looking to posit the relative success of <i>Respect the Fly Shit </i>as another win for ""New York hip-hop."" Lauren has a persona, but not much personality as a rapper. As anyone who heard ""Bag of Money"" from <i>Dr. Lecter </i>knows, Lauren is way funnier and personable ranting at the end of a track than he is putting rhymes together. Describing an <i>in flagrante </i>moment with a morally casual woman, he stammers, ""I was on the wall like I was <i>punished</i>… I had that face of <i>gratification</i>."" He explains the jarring shift of ""Let's Hold Hands"" by announcing, ""We do love songs too, man, we love bitches,"" and the Xs and Os at the end are, ""I love you like I love my Polo leather."" He continues: ""You know how I love that butter soft (I <i>love </i>that jacket)."" That's some funny shit. All in all, it explains why we're here in the first place and that's because <i>Respect the Fly Shit </i>at the very least proves that as long as Meyhem Lauren sounds like a cool guy to hang around with, it can make you feel guilty about pointing out how little he brings to the party.</p>

There are innumerable stories of musicians stumbling across moments of inspiration while fooling around in the studio, although usually these are happy accidents that merely serve to flesh out a much bigger picture. Australian musician <a href=""http://www.orenambarchi.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oren Ambarchi</a>, currently in the midst of an extremely productive run of albums, simply let that kind of impulsive thinking dominate his entire work mode when putting together <i>Sagittarian Domain</i>. He admitted in a <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/hear-oren-ambarchis-33-minute-kraut-psych-noise-rock-odyssey-sagittarian-domain"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a> that he had ""no idea"" how the record was going to pan out when he went into Melbourne's Sing Sing studio to record it. At the center of <i>Sagittarian Domain</i>, which consists of one 33-minute track, is a gigantic standoff between restriction and freedom. Ambarchi had just one day in the studio to complete the project, pushing a severe time limit up against his wide-open approach to recording. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Fitting that distinction to his music and method, essentially setting two opposing forces in motion, is exactly the kind of counterintuitive approach that has served Ambarchi well over the years. At this point in his career, the word ""drone"" is still commonly affixed as a descriptor to his art, even though he's more than capable of turning any expectations foisted on him inside out. On <i>Sagittarian Domain</i> there's a great spring in his step, a sense of playfulness, a feeling of open-ended journey. Krautrock comes to mind, just for the sheer driving repetition scooped into the heart of the track. But this isn't the taut playing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a> or the percussion-heavy raptures of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>. This is something altogether more baggy, set in a place where the slackness at its core acts as a conduit for all the ideas siphoned into it. There's almost a jazzy tinge to the drumming, like Klaus Dinger suddenly freed from all the no-fuss discipline he brought to his work.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The centerpiece ""Knots"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16320-audience-of-one/""><i>Audience of One</i></a> found Ambarchi matching abstract bursts of noise with giddy strings, a thread he partially picks up again here. Working with a three-piece string section-- violin, viola, and cello-- he allows the song to warp and crumple in unexpected ways, pushing it toward bombast at times. Certainly there's a vast step-up in energy as he gradually affords his accompanying musicians space. By the time ""Sagittarian Domain"" passes the 20-minute mark, we're in a different world from the low-key synth and guitar textures that abutted his circuitous playing in the first half of the song. The cello feels like a dark energy wrapping itself around the track, set in stark simultaneous resistance to the violin pushing everything up toward the sky. It's that feeling of unlikely contiguous variants once again, all feeding off an irregular force derived from Ambarchi's inclination for just trying out stuff to see where it leads him.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's appropriate, then, that <i>Sagittarian Domain</i> lands in a place at its end that couldn't possibly have been predicted from its beginning. Many artists who use repetition as a framework play the game of build and release, stretching the loud-quiet-loud aesthetic across vast plains of land. Ambarchi does that to an extent here, but he relinquishes hold at the end by sucking out most of his own playing and allowing the string section a full five minutes to stretch. If the main part of the song offers a chance to blank out the world by getting lost in pure rhythm, here he gently bumps it back to reality, a sad, bruised, lonely coda to a track that never felt like it was in the same orbit as that kind of feeling. Music often works well by building natural bridges between things-- a verse sliding into a chorus, lyrics that equate sadness with melancholia, bursts of guitar that make euphoria and aggression collide into one another-- but here Ambarchi shows how sharp about-turns and starkly dissimilar contrasts can be equally potent.</p>

Originally started in 2001, it had only released eight titles over the course of a decade, but 2011 would prove to be a busy year for Hebden. Rather than rest on the laurels and accolades for 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13861-there-is-love-in-you/"" target=""_blank""><i>There Is Love in You</i></a>, he released his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15830-fabriclive-59/"" target=""_blank"">entry</a> in the acclaimed Fabriclive series, toured and DJed internationally, and then jumpstarted Text with two plain sleeve 12""'s: ""Ego""/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12145-mirror/"" target=""_blank"">""Mirror""</a> was a Four Tet collaboration with dubstep demiurge Burial and some British bloke named Thom Yorke and ""Pinnacles""/""Ye Ye"" was a split single featuring Four Tet and Caribou's Dan Snaith (before he assumed his Daphni moniker).</p>
<p>The former signified a decade's worth of British electronic music--running from <i>Kid A</i> through Four Tet and onto Burial-- while Four Tet's ""Pinnacles"" served a function similar to his 2008 EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11505-ringer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ringer</i></a>. After the loft jazz-inspired <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3168-everything-ecstatic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Everything Ecstatic</i></a> and a heady collaboration with noted jazz/soul/African/funk drummer Steve Reid that resulted in numerous drum-laptop improv albums and suggested that Hebden might never quite return to earth, <i>Ringer</i> reminded fans that Hebden has always kept an ear to the dancefloor. But whereas that EP reveled in 4/4 minimal-yet-playful techno bangers, ""Pinnacles"" was a decidedly more ambitious affair, intermingling dubstep's wobble with an elegant McCoy Tyner-esque piano line, Joe Meek guitar lick, and some lasers. Perhaps spurred by the ""Thom Yorke Bump,"" it triggered a year's worth of heady dance singles from Hebden, spanning three 12""'s (with another credited to the moniker Percussions), all compiled now on <i>Pink</i> with an additional two unreleased tracks.</p>
<p>""Locked"" opens things and hearkens back to the Four Tet of old. A dusty, crackling drum break that would make b-boys bob heads lopes around, but it soon abuts another machine pulse, suggesting an African polyrhythm about its downtempo pace. It's from this trickier rhythmic bed (with a substrata of bass frequencies) that Hebden builds up a wistful melody that evokes memories of his 2003 breakout album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3166-rounds/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rounds</i></a>. The unreleased ""Lion"" follows, suggesting both the earliest instances of late-80s tribal house as well as <i>au courant</i> UK bass music, the primitive yips, clipped kalimba line and speedy metabolism of the snare underpinned by a menacing drone.</p>
<p>When the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13568-jupiters/"" target=""_blank"">""Jupiters""</a> single dropped earlier this year, I was a tad underwhelmed as the overture-- while stately and lovely-- seemed to do little for the side. Yet it works better in the context of <i>Pink</i>, providing a beatless interlude before dropping us into Four Tet's most bass-heavy and adventurous track to date, nodding to Autechre at their crunchiest and 2-step at its twitchiest. It's followed by its standout flipside, ""Ocoras"", wherein Hebden takes what could be a skipping CD of organ music and some of Pantha du Prince's struck-bell tones and minces them finely before sprinkling atop some propulsive minimal techno.</p>
<p>A skittering hi-hat rather than harps power <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13714-128-harps/"" target=""_blank"">""128 Harps""</a> and again evokes the ""idyllictronica"" tag once affixed to Four Tet's particular strain of electronic music. ""Pyramid"", originally the B-side for ""Locked"", has a Model 500-worthy bassline and Hebden again deploys a voice (uttering ""I remember how you walked away"") in much the same manner as he did on ""Love Cry"". Those components alone would make this a standout track, but he again pushes at such parameters and at around the four minute mark, a shimmering metallophone melody worthy of Steve Reich arises and provides a break: not in the sense of unadorned drums building up tension for release, but like a sun through clouds. And while <i>Pink</i> should not be conflated with a proper follow-up to <i>There Is Love in You</i>, even as a singles comp it suggests that the undergrad producer circa <i>Rounds</i> is now post-doctorate, and Four Tet is capable of going deeper and expanding higher than almost anyone else out there.</p></div>"|17093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17093-pink/|8.2|Andy Beta

Eventually, he went from stranded to extradited, left to make his home back in the London birthplace he hadn't lived in since he was a kid. Whether this is what really put a potential crimp in every possible latter-day planning-stages project from <i>Madvillainy 2</i> to <i>Swift and Changeable</i> is up in the air, it seems almost beside the point in this context: He's also been isolated from his family, most of his friends, and a significant amount of his own personal agency. It'd almost be a plot-thickening chapter in his outsized four-color supervillain persona if the real-world implications weren't so disheartening.</p>
<p>But DOOM is nothing if not adaptable, and his sense of humor is always present, even when there's good reason to be disillusioned. So after tuning in to the liberating potential of his new homebase-- <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/16/doom-key-to-the-kuffs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he recently told <i>The Guardian</i></a> that he's able to live freely ""incognito,"" ironically more likely to be recognized with the mask than without-- he put together a fractured but widescreen picture of a cult icon in exile. <i>Key to the Kuffs</i> hits all of DOOM's angles, from the well-documented (wise-ass shit-talker) to the underrated (political agitator) to the overlooked (sentimental romantic). And with the co-billed producer angle-- JJ being Jneiro Jarel, the Danger to his Doom and the Mad to his Villain this time around-- there's the added potential to see this as another case of a collaboration providing a new facet to an already ambiguous public face.</p>
<p><i>Key to the Kuffs</i> has a persona that's a lot harder to pinpoint than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Madvillainy</i></a>'s blunted Jack Kirby surrealism or the adult-cartoon goofiness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2624-the-mouse-and-the-mask/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Mouse and the Mask</i></a>. Not that there's a shortage of either; here you get bloodshot pulp crime atmosphere and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4puw7ARRMHc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Regular Show"" clips</a> rubbing elbows in the album's first five minutes. But aside from the loose DOOM-in-England motif, there's not enough of an overarching theme that Jarel's serviceable-but-indistinct production can pull together. Not that cohesion's the most important thing to preserve-- it doesn't take a lot to ""get"" DOOM at this point, and the blend of big-idea tracks about things like communicable diseases or Frankenfoods mixed in with rapping-for-its-own-sake is comfortably accessible without being all that bland. And there's precedent for Jarel and DOOM working well together-- Shape of Broad Minds' <i>Craft of the Lost Art</i> highlight ""Let's Go"" attests to that.</p>
<p>Things have changed in the ensuing years, though, and Jarel's restless style has shifted from a psychedelic proto-Brainfeeder fellow traveler of Flying Lotus to something a bit more matter-of-fact on this record. For the majority of <i>Key to the Kuffs</i>, or at least the majority that DOOM has a verse or two, the beats glide along in an unobtrusive way that's more easily nodded at than nodded to. Some moments bump, like the hissing new wave funk of ""Rhymin' Slang"" and ""Wash Your Hands"" or the xylophone boom-bap of ""Retarded Fren"". Others approach a subtly off-kilter weirdness, like the bloated, drunk-sounding tuba that serves as the bassline to ""Borin' Convo"". But they're usually the least attention-getting aspects of any given track and, as typified by instrumental ""Viberian Sun II"", not especially interesting isolated from vocals or sound clips. Even the two widely touted guest-spot moments feel low-key: Damon Albarn's presence on ""Bite the Thong"" is pared down to the point of almost sounding subliminal, like a dub of a tunnel-bound cell phone call to an AM radio station 50 miles away, while Beth Gibbons' appearance on ""GMO"" is too smothered in bass to register as much more than an unintelligible phantom melody. Khujo Goodie's 88-second Willie Isz reunion ""STILL KAPS"" leaves more of an impact.</p>
<p>It's just as well that the beats don't overstep; every time DOOM's voice appears it takes over so authoritatively that, sloppy or on-point, the flow becomes more prominent than the beat he rides over. Sometimes it's borderline detrimental, like the first few (well, OK, several) bars of his hobbled-sprint double-time turn on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13181-banished/"" target=""_blank"">""Banished""</a> that seem to scramble over the beat without entirely gaining his footing-- which almost works, since the hyperventilating analog bass grumble is one of the few productions on the album that could be properly described as ""filthy."" And there are some signs of apparent rust or performances that sound like first takes-- he's so mush-mouthed on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13951-guvnor/"" target=""_blank"">""Guv'nor""</a> that a line where he says ""splurge"" sounds more like ""splshurghs""-- that threaten to sabotage the plainspoken-yet-crafty wordplay and abrupt turns into tight-packed internal rhymes that usually makes his voice so first-bar immediate.</p>
<p>And yet he's no less quotable than he was in '99-- the same track that has him slurring the word ""splurge"" has him seamlessly integrating the 2010 Icelandic volcano eruption into a punchline, for fuck's sake (""Catch a throatful from the fire vocal/ Ash and molten glass like Eyjafjallajökull""). He's still missile-silo deep with vocabulary, and when his voice backs him up, he's untouchable; there's a stretch in ""Rhymin' Slang""-- ""Rarely, scarcely, scary glaring stare/ Let's be very clear, MCs is derriere/ As well as aware, wearily, just don't be nearly near, you hear me? <i>Yeah</i>""-- that's tailor-made for dropped-jaw rewinds. The thematic tracks are heavy on the diabolical brainiac grifter guise that's fueled his post-KMD creativity for some 15 years, balancing knowledge and absurdity like a master. ""GMO"" pulls out the bioengineering terminology, wraps it in conspiracy-theory allusions, and makes it both scatologically funny and unnerving all at once. And there's rarely been a hip-hop track like ""Wash Your Hands"" that's gotten more creative mileage out of how germ-filled the human body can be (""You like the way she shake her back area/ It's like a sex machine that make bacteria""). But the loose theme of DOOM's UK exile really hits in the homesick, lovesick ""Winter Blues"", one of the most heartfelt tracks of DOOM's career in a way that's funny and affecting; his line about how ""I need a handful of melanin/ Feelin' like the lamb's wool beard on your tender skin"" is disarmingly touching from a man usually considered to be an outsized cartoon alter-ego. He may have found a new creative space in his birthplace, but it'll be a relief when he finally gets back to a place he can call home.</p></div>"|16916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16916-key-to-the-kuffs/|7.3|Nate Patrin

You could say this, of course, about a lot music and plenty of solo records in particular, but there's a certain embrace of tranquility, diffuseness, and acceptance of solitude that links their sensibilities. The nocturnal, Latin-tinged loops of Helado Negro's 2011 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15489-canta-lechuza/"" target=""_blank""><i>Canta Lechuza </i></a>(translation: owl singing), were pleasantly insomniac, like what you'd listen to after everyone else in the house has gone to sleep, knowing that's when your best ideas come. Same goes for the layered, wordless vocal wisps out of which Barwick composed the songs on her best and most recent LP, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15147-the-magic-place/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Magic Place</i></a>. Hovering somewhere between pop melodicism and ambient abstraction, Helado Negro and Barwick's music reimagines solitude not as a form of loneliness, but instead as something productive, joyful, quietly beatific.</p>
<p>So what happens when two happy-go-lucky loners work together? We got an inkling of the answer late last year, when Lange offered up his take on Barwick's ""Vow"" for her decent, if superfluous, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15926-the-matrimony-remixes-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Matrimony Remixes</a> </i>EP. Moreso than Diplo &amp; Lunice's relatively boilerplate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12546-vow-diplo-and-lunice-remix/"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of the same track, Lange's version kept something of Barwick's sensibility intact, favoring cumulous atmosphere over groove. A product of nearly two years of casually jamming together in his Brooklyn studio, <i>Believe You Me</i>, Lange and Barwick's debut record together as <a href=""http://asthmatickitty.com/ombre"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OMBRE</a>, lives up to the promise of this remix, and in some cases even improves upon it.</p>
<p>Because Barwick's style is so transparent, <i>Believe You Me</i> sounds, ostensibly, more like a Helado Negro record than one of her solo efforts: Lange's casually strummed upstrokes and thick, relaxed croon will sound familiar to any ears acquainted with <i>Canta Lechuza</i>. But closer listens reveal Barwick's contributions-- and her ameliorating affects on Lange's approach. <i>Lechuza</i>'s fascination with blips and glitches was, occasionally, its downfall; Lange couldn't always work in his electro-tendencies without interrupting or detracting from the tracks' atmosphere. The addition of Barwick here actually subtracts elements from his sound, often to great effect. Her weightless backing vocals steer the zero-gravity Tropicália of ""Noche Brilla Pts. 1 and 2"", and add a celestial gloss to the loungey and gorgeous ""Weight Those Words"", which should be played on a loop in every hotel bar in heaven.</p>
<p>Like any good abstractionist, Barwick <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/ombre-video-premiere-cara-falsa#_"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> the name ""ombre"" came, simply, from some chance encounters with the word and a penchant for the way it sounds. But the word's meaning (think color gradient fabrics) fits the project-- and its occasional shortcomings as well. Though their sensibilities have a lot in common, certain particulars of Barwick and Lange's sounds are so different that the project sometimes feels like it lacks an overall cohesion. The Latin influence, for example, drops out in the second half, and after a few tracks on which Barwick's featherlight, wordless vocals take the lead, the complete disappearance of Lange's voice feels odd. Still, in its more blissful and transcendent moments (like the single ""Cara Falsa""), all earthly quibbles feel beside the point. Going back to the image conjured by the name ""ombre"", seamless cohesion-- or a blending of two colors into one completely new hue--doesn't seem to be the pair's goal. Instead, <i>Believe You Me</i> comes off as a collaboration between two dyed-in-the-wool daydreamers, finding both harmony and intriguing incongruity in their respective visions.</p></div>"|16965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16965-believe-you-me/|7.1|Lindsay Zoladz

To promote his new record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30193-delicate-steve/"" target=""_blank"">Delicate Steve</a>-- aka 25-year old guitarist Steve Marion-- hid play-buttons around Brooklyn and Manhattan for people to plug their headphones into and hear <i>Positive Force</i> ahead of release; hook up to one at Valentino Pier to hear Steve's chandelier psychedelia, and you might believe you'd just jacked into the heart of a secret world powered by raw joy. Though Marion's real-life existence seems equally paradisiacal: He hails from New Jersey, where he's part of the <a href=""http://smallboypants.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smallboypants</a> collective, most of whom play in his live band. He's signed to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"" target=""_blank"">David Byrne</a>'s <a href=""http://luakabop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Luaka Bop</a> label, spends his time taking 100-mile bike rides, playing basketball, or hanging out with his sonic brothers in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28477-fang-island/"" target=""_blank"">Fang Island</a>-- who, it transpires, run <a href=""http://www.cmj.com/tv/delicate-steve-interview-steve-marion-cmj-tv/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""a cheese van""</a> in New York, and named their truffle oil-infused grilled sandwich after him: Anyone for the $10 ""Delicate Cheese""? <i>Positive Force</i> sounds a little like what might happen if you sent Fang Island's hyperactive music on an Eastern detox retreat-- though letting them hang onto the cheese's sentiment, if not its harder to digest aspects.</p>
<p>In a <a href=""http://prettymuchamazing.com/interview/yeasayer-anaand-wilder"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5506-yeasayer/"" target=""_blank""> Yeasayer</a>'s Anand Wilder said that Delicate Steve's music-- they're old touring buddies-- had made him excited about the guitar again, and it's a shame that he didn't incorporate more of Steve's vivid, lively playing into the limp <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16940-fragrant-world/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fragrant World</i></a>. Marion is one of those rare guitarists whose instrument sings in the place of vocals: <i>Positive Force</i> is predominantly instrumental, but you'll hear him take a breath at the very beginning to introduce his second voice. The combination of mic-ing up his Telecaster's strings and an amp, then blending the two together, sounds crystalline and futuristic, gently boisterous and squirty. His guitar sings like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8391-george-harrison/"" target=""_blank"">George Harrison</a>'s guitar reanimated, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11361-dustin-wong/"" target=""_blank"">Dustin Wong</a>'s post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5037-ponytail/"" target=""_blank"">Ponytail</a> solo releases, the most melodic moments from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16806-swing-lo-magellan/"" target=""_blank""><i>Swing Lo Magellan</i></a>, and the effects on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"" target=""_blank"">Julia Holter</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46299-watch-julia-holter-collaborates-with-jib-kidder/"" target=""_blank"">marvelous collaboration with Jib Kidder</a> from earlier this year. It often wheezes like old fairground organs, and beams with an open-heartedness you'll recognize from the 80s sitcom theme tunes that instantly tell you happiness is on the way, like ""Charles in Charge"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TWqqSMRFbU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It's Your Move""</a>.</p>
<p>The songs here resolve beautifully, but never predictably, with more attention paid to their structure than on Marion's first LP, <i>Wondervisions</i>. The cooing ""Two Lovers"" trickles like two tributaries, one shallow and one deep, flowing against each other before achieving confluence in a babbling whirlpool. The conversation between the blooming bass and sleek vocalizing on ""Big Time Receiver"" seems like the responsible voices of parents idly keeping an eye on the miniature, skittering ticks and itches dancing around them. Standout track ""Wally Wilder"" is the theme to <i>Midnight Cowboy</i> by way of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>, harking back to the early-1970s trend for harmonica melodies to replace vocals, the perfect example of which would be the wondrous <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaQWOne1sfo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Groovin' With Mr. Bloe""</a>. The sound of birdsong and the feel of a balmy, sun-dappled garden glows throughout.</p>
<p>If there's anything wrong with <i>Positive Force</i>, it's that it's better suited as background music than bearing up to intense listening; while the guitar lines on most of the songs here are deliciously difficult to whistle, they're all essentially fairly similar. And only ""Redeemer"" and the title track manage to reiterate the terrifically strong opening salvo of ""Ramona Reborn"" and ""Wally Wilder"". But for a strong run at a rapidly forming philosophy of positive vibes and inspiringly innovative playing, it's hard to want to pick holes in a record that more than lives up to its title.</p></div>"|16919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16919-positive-force/|7.6|Laura Snapes

But their core was always the founding duo of guitarist <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29205-bill-orcutt/"">Bill Orcutt</a> and drummer/singer Adris Hoyos. The former's unmistakable car-crash sound and the latter's primal beats and soul-stiffening screams defined the group's destructive aesthetic, leading Douglas Wolk to <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12449-youll-never-play-this-town-again/"">brand them</a> ""just about the most abrasive band America has ever seen.""</p>
<p>Though they earned that superlative, it's slightly misleading. Because while Harry Pussy could over-stuff speakers with bracing din, they also injected space and structure into their racket. At times they sounded more like a punk-damaged free jazz group than an abstract noise machine. That's especially true of early duo recordings by Orcutt and Hoyos, where the pair's intuitive interplay is clearest. When Orcutt pinches out piercing notes and Hoyos responds with snare slaps that propel him into clanging chords, the result is more conversation than confrontation.</p>
<p>Orcutt used only duo material to create <i>One Plus One</i>, combing through over 10 hours of Walkman-recorded sessions. Along the way he grabbed some pieces that had already appeared without titles on early 7""s, but he edited them anew and gave them all names. That may seem purposefully confusing, but Orcutt's intent was actually genuine. He approached <i>One Plus One</i> as a new release rather than a reissue, selecting the best, most complementary material regardless of whether it had been heard before.</p>
<p>It was a wise choice, because <i>One Plus One</i> is better-paced and more coherent than anything released while Harry Pussy were still together. It still has tons of clamor and dissonance, and even the most welcoming songs challenge ears. But the album flows with a distinct internal logic, as Orcutt and Hoyos revisit sounds, work out ideas, and explore what happens when they use the same moves in different contexts.

But their core was always the founding duo of guitarist <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29205-bill-orcutt/"">Bill Orcutt</a> and drummer/singer Adris Hoyos. The former's unmistakable car-crash sound and the latter's primal beats and soul-stiffening screams defined the group's destructive aesthetic, leading Douglas Wolk to <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12449-youll-never-play-this-town-again/"">brand them</a> ""just about the most abrasive band America has ever seen.""</p>
<p>Though they earned that superlative, it's slightly misleading. Because while Harry Pussy could over-stuff speakers with bracing din, they also injected space and structure into their racket. At times they sounded more like a punk-damaged free jazz group than an abstract noise machine. That's especially true of early duo recordings by Orcutt and Hoyos, where the pair's intuitive interplay is clearest. When Orcutt pinches out piercing notes and Hoyos responds with snare slaps that propel him into clanging chords, the result is more conversation than confrontation.</p>
<p>Orcutt used only duo material to create <i>One Plus One</i>, combing through over 10 hours of Walkman-recorded sessions. Along the way he grabbed some pieces that had already appeared without titles on early 7""s, but he edited them anew and gave them all names. That may seem purposefully confusing, but Orcutt's intent was actually genuine. He approached <i>One Plus One</i> as a new release rather than a reissue, selecting the best, most complementary material regardless of whether it had been heard before.</p>
<p>It was a wise choice, because <i>One Plus One</i> is better-paced and more coherent than anything released while Harry Pussy were still together. It still has tons of clamor and dissonance, and even the most welcoming songs challenge ears. But the album flows with a distinct internal logic, as Orcutt and Hoyos revisit sounds, work out ideas, and explore what happens when they use the same moves in different contexts. So when Orcutt repeats a vibrating riff in ""Forming"", it resembles a fractured <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Wray"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Link Wray</a> outtake; when he stretches a similar chord into a stoned drag during ""On the Couch"", it evokes <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/5096-the-dead-c/"">the Dead C</a> applying their patented lurch to ""Forming"".</p>

Well, what's to know?"" asks Jack Tatum on the title track of Wild Nothing's <i>Nocturne</i>. The album's subtly addictive nature is such that only after a dozen listens did this anti-revelation strike me as its most revealing lyric. Tatum really does view himself as a facilitator. He drove that point home during <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8902-wild-nothing/"">our interview</a> last month, debunking any attempts made in the past two years to classify him as a ""personality."" This seems self-defeating for a guy who works in a style of lovelorn, Anglophilic indie rock that never goes <i>in </i>style because it never really goes out of style, and tends to favor extreme recluses or extroverts for its breakout artists. Fortunately, <i>Nocturne </i>distinguishes itself from the perrennial crowd of dream-pop nostalgists for the same reason Wild Nothing's 2010 debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14280-gemini/"" target=""_blank"">Gemini</a></i> did: Tatum is simply one of the best songwriters in this field, and <i>Nocturne</i>'s significant upgrade in fidelity<i> </i>makes that point more clearly than ever.</p>
<p>Whether it's better than <i>Gemini </i>or its EP follow-up, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14937-golden-haze-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Golden Haze</a></i>,<i> </i>only matters in the event you have room for just one Wild Nothing album in your life, and you probably shouldn't limit yourself. It's hard to imagine anyone who dug <i>Gemini </i>jumping ship here-- <i>Nocturne </i>is a richer, comparatively luxurious listening experience, but it doesn't sound flashy or ostentatious. Even while recording with one of Brooklyn's classiest sonic interior decorators in Nicolas Vernhes, Tatum granted himself only basic amenities-- live strings, a human drummer, better microphones.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Nocturne </i>is painted with the same colors as <i>Gemini</i>,<i> </i>but the resolution is much higher. When the songs on <i>Gemini </i>wanted to convey vitality or physicality, they were charmingly ramshackle, stuffed with busy drum machines and insistently strummed guitar. If <i>Nocturne </i>wants for anything, it's the sense of immediacy that marked highlights such as ""Chinatown"" and ""Summer Holiday"". This record is more about craftsmanship. Lead singles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13760-shadow/"" target=""_blank"">""Shadow""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14002-paradise/"" target=""_blank"">""Paradise""</a> feel newly urgent in a holistic way, going places Tatum couldn't access in his Blacksburg dorm room two years ago. ""Shadow"" allows itself brief asides between verses to let those lustrous strings moan and swoon, ""Paradise"" interrupts its glistening downer-disco for an indulgent ambient build-up. The full-bodied sound means the softer side of <i>Nocturne </i>gets fleshier too. <i>Gemini </i>relied on reverb to convey texture and depth, and while there's still plenty on ""Through the Grass"", the rhythmic complexity of the song's delicate, interwoven arrangement plays a bigger role in making it one of the loveliest thing to be done with guitars this year.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Entire labels and local scenes are dedicated to preserving the era <i>Nocturne </i>evokes-- lacquering the malaised vocals, getting the right reverb plates, and hoping that aesthetic identification is more important than writing melodies that stick. Tatum, however, is a songwriter first who just happens to work in this medium. His vocals are put to the forefront to give the listener a clearly marked place to return, and his melodies are smoothly curved, like a small divot at which the rest of the arrangements can dig deeper. The hopscotch verse melody of ""Shadow"" works in tandem with an insistent, four-note motif doubled on lead guitar and violin. On ""Counting Days"", a simonized harmony serves as the chorus, but the little guitar countermelody that darts around it is the hook. Tatum understands the semantics of this stuff.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Which makes it strange that his ambitions as a melodic tunesmith aren't matched by his lyrics. Successfully writing like Robert Smith can be just as tricky as doing a decent Morrissey, which becomes clear every time <i>Nocturne </i>crosses an invisible line where a tiny bit of editing would pay off: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14002-paradise/"" target=""_blank"">""Paradise""</a> contains the sensible-sounding, yet bafflingly mixed metaphor ""velvet tongue so sweet"", while ""Only Heather"" rhymes first and asks questions later: ""I couldn't explain it/ I won't even try/ She is so lovely she makes me feel high.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Or maybe that's the only kind of lyric that really matters on <i>Nocturne. </i>If there's a Heather in your life, that song might be the centerpiece of your next mix. Or you might just listen to it hoping you'll meet a Heather, in which case, Wild Nothing is invested in the concept of wish fulfillment. This is called <i>dream-</i>pop for a reason, and there's no logic for what drives adults to lie out on the grass staring at the sun for hours or write songs about girls with fantastical names like ""Rheya"". <i>Nocturne </i>gives a voice to those feelings, and damn if it isn't lovely to listen to.</p>

Each successive release under the Detroit producer's own name has seen him reveal more of himself as he simultaneously retreats deeper into the shadows. As his singing voice continues to take a front-and-center position in his slithery electronic pop productions, it's also acquired a dark and oily air of decadence. <i>Beams</i>, his fifth solo full-length under his own name, is said by its maker to be more ""positive"" in disposition than 2010's high-water mark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14533-black-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black City</i></a>. But don't be fooled. ""I laughed when they hit you with their sticks/ You cried,"" goes one refrain.</p>
<p>So the sinister hedonism continues. And while there's nothing quite as tongue-in-ear lascivious as <i>Black City</i>'s Reznor-ian ""You Put a Smell on Me"", <i>Beams</i>' constant neon-gray chug brings to mind a party that never ends. Synths peer through the chemical murk, occasionally breaking through before getting swallowed up by clouds of grime. Basslines wobble with sickness. The song in which Dear sums up the whole vibe-- ""Take a trip on something else""-- is called ""Fighting Is Futile"", and the title defines <i>Beams</i>' album-length experience: Dramamine be damned, it's tough to pull your way out of this thing.</p>
<p>There's been no reason to assume that Matthew Dear lives this hedonistic shit for real, but <i>Beams</i> feels more personal. The first-person pronoun is all over these 11 tracks. Dear wasn't always comfortable being so bold, either vocally and in terms of accessible songwriting. His 2003 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2526-leave-luck-to-heaven/"" target=""_blank""><i>Leave Luck to Heaven</i></a>, and the following year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2527-backstroke/"" target=""_blank""><i>Backstroke</i></a> saw his voice gasping in bursts under the abstract, janky techno soundscapes that are associated with his track-oriented work as Audion. The side of Dear that most are familiar with today emerged on 2007's enjoyable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10289-asa-breed/"" target=""_blank""><i>Asa Breed</i></a>, a watershed that lacked cohesion but made up for its disjointed faults by virtue of sheer pop playfulness. <i>Black City</i> brought all these elements together, but Beams actually one-ups its predecessor in terms of cohesion. The album is Dear's most consistent work yet, operating as one upward build that, save for the leaden ""Shake Me"" (which feels out of place even without knowing its status as a repurposed demo that dates back to 2003), moves in the same direction until its conclusion.</p>
<p>But consistency is a tricky thing. There are a few impressive, memorable highlights here-- the steam-column elation of album opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13677-her-fantasy/"" target=""_blank"">""Her Fantasy""</a>, the radiant confusion of ""Ahead of Myself"". But as a front-to-back experience, the album doesn't exactly stay with you. In one sense, it feels like a victory lap, extending some of the best ideas from his strong recent run without improving on any of them. Next year marks a decade since Matthew Dear started releasing music under his own name. And given that almost every release since then has seen him pushing his close-quarters aesthetic further into new territory, <i>Beams</i>' relative stasis is excusable. </p></div>"|16973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16973-beams/|7.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

Though <i>Years Past Matter</i> is the band's shortest record to date, it is also their most relentless and unforgiving, comprising six tracks of impossibly choreographed and dense four-part motion. In light of their propensity for 10-plus-minute spans, Krallice have previously experimented with ways to ease ingestion of these monstrosities, employing an antiphonal, long-short-long tracklist for 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13840-dimensional-bleedthrough/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dimensional Bleedthrough</i></a> and both starting and ending 2011's otherwise monolithic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15419-diotima/"" target=""_blank""><i>Diotima</i></a> with relatively brief pieces. But for the most part, <i>Years Past Matter</i> starts, lashes ahead for a dozen minutes at a time, and then, after a 16-minute closer that might be Krallice's most demanding and glorious piece of music yet, ends. Sure, there are a few relative breaks in the roil, like the two minutes of guitar haze that lead out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13973-iiiiiiii/"" target=""_blank"">""IIIIIIII""</a> or the doom-suggestive interlude before the album's triumphant close. But for the most part, <i>Years Past Matter</i> is arrogant and unapologetic-- a daunting, rewarding hour that calls for complete immersion.</p>
<p>In recent years, when it's come to bending black metal, plenty of acts have focused on the auxiliary instrumentation, whether that's the keyboard layers they add to the pieces, the digital beats that supplant or subsidize their drums, or the extra electronics and textures that might subdivide their songs. But Krallice are, at least in terms of personnel, a traditional four-piece, with two guitarists (Mick Barr and Colin Marston), a bassist (Nicholas McMaster), a drummer (Lev Weinstein), and two vocalists (Barr and McMaster) who approach their screams with equal gusto but very different tones. What separates Krallice, though, is their audacity and exactitude, meaning that they generally not only trot past the 10-minute mark but also do so with songs where every bit seems rigorously composed, where nothing seems arbitrary or extraneous.</p>
<p>They've never sounded as comprehensive and confident as they do on <i>Years Past Matter</i>. Album opener ""IIIIIII"", for instance, moves in fits and starts, droning, then roaring, then washing out, then galloping ahead-- all in about the first 80 seconds. The four members are synced so well and completely; McMaster's bass doesn't sit still waiting for the guitars or drums to chance, and the guitars act more like complements than competitors. Listening to <i>Years Past Matter</i> is almost like listening to the Flaming Lips' <i>Zaireeka</i>, where all four discs (or members, as it were) are meant to be heard at once, though it can be just as fascinating to try and isolate just one sound. If every band is supposed to write around its weakest link, by this point, it's probably best to quit calling Krallice a band. They show no such weakness.</p>
<p>Four albums in, what might now be most impressive about Krallice is how selflessly the quartet seems to write and render these songs. If you're just glancing at the track lengths, you might anticipate protratced solos or, at the very least, spotlights and showcases for Barr and Marston, two of the best guitarists working right now. But even when they're furthest out in front-- as on the back half of ""IIIIIIIII"", with their guitars in flinty dialogue and occasionally in dead-ahead harmony-- McMaster and Weinstein aren't sitting passively, waiting for their turn to come. They push and pull at the rhythm, as though to force the guitars one way or the other; in fact, one of the best guitar passages here, about seven minutes into ""IIIIIIIII"", stems from the sort of roller coaster Weinstein and McMaster create and the way Barr and Marston are able to dip down with it and zip back toward the crest without distraction.</p>
<p>All of those assets-- the complexity and precision, the density and cooperation, the rigor and the delivery-- coalesce perfectly during ""IIIIIIIIIIII"", a 16-minute epic that finds Krallice pushing past the limitations of anything they've ever done. Aside from a short section near the beginning, this closer is largely instrumental, built on a short, flicking riff that Marston and Barr stretch, contract, and subsequently spin into the strangest shapes. Led by Weinstein's versatility, the song's pieces seem to form a cycle of interconnected circles, where each section capitalizes on repetition and variation before shifting seamlessly into the next one. Krallice have never sounded so ecstatic before, so perfectly delirious with the strength of their own designs. Like all of <i>Years Past Matter</i>, its finale is great on first listen and increasingly tremendous on repeat. It's strange to admit it, but when this 16-minute beast snaps shut, I generally just play it again, giving the blur one more chance to blossom into clarity.</p></div>"|17100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17100-years-past-matter/|8.2|Grayson Currin

The quick rundown: He dropped several albums and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBx-M2oRBLg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one smash hit</a> (which benefited heavily from a peak-era Lil' Wayne hook) as a member of Playaz Circle. He worked as Ludacris' understudy at DTP. He's had his fair share of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OdYiUnPqG8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">great music</a> scattered across a career that now touches three different decades of hip-hop history. After building a sudden, cult-like mixtape buzz across the country, his solo debut, <i>Based on a T.R.U. Story</i>, has moved an impressive 147,000 copies, a new industry benchmark of how to shift from mixtapes to sales, and a cynical example of the bare minimum of creativity required for that level of success.</p>
<p>He's released solo mixtapes for several years, but it wasn't until 2010's <i>Me Against the World 2: Codeine Withdrawal </i> and <i>Trap-A-Velli 2: (The Residue)</i> that the spark seemed to find a fuse. These tapes even pre-dated the mainstream-friendly 2 Chainz name transition, and indicated possible new momentum behind what had been an aging franchise; tracks like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJmqy-DgGNY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Between Me and U""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAzP0sjfF6w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Up in Smoke""</a> (a masterful, underrated fusion of Christión's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwik0Lon-g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Full of Smoke""</a> with Art of Noise's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIcmIhOesaI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Moments in Love""</a>) indicated the rapper had a gift for the hazy afterparty slow jam, in an era when most artists reaching for the brass ring of Atlanta's rap game had to knock out peak-time hits. It's easy to see Tity's presence in Gucci Mane's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a16NUb3WC-4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Everybody Looking"" </a>video as a kind of Styrofoam baton pass; just as Gucci's popular appeal reached a fevered pitch, he returned to prison. He was joined by T.I., hamstrung by repeated probation violations, while Young Jeezy, ready to capitalize off a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsmqrk7Wgsk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hot street single</a>, languished in label purgatory. Atlanta and its major hip-hop infrastructure-- the strip clubs, mixtape trade, and tour circuit-- had a star machine to generate revenue with a vacuum in its center. Into the void gawkily sauntered a new hero, who took the path  pioneered by 50 Cent, adapted to the internet era by Lil Wayne, and fully fleshed out with three-dimensional songcraft by Gucci Mane.</p>
<p>It's hard to avoid the feeling, particularly on his debut LP, that 2 Chainz is only able to fill those shoes by sheer force of will, rather than anything resembling artistic inspiration. His verses these days consist of blue-collar hip-hop cultural touchpoints (True Religion jeans, eating at Waffle House and Benihana, a general lack of interest in the consumer choices made on <i>Watch the Throne</i>) spit with a few basic rhyme patterns. These are bundled together by punchlines that split the difference between Gucci's effortless nonchalance and Young Money's rib-jabbing hashtag joke style. The gulf between those approaches is deep, yet 2 Chainz manages the tough act of seeming simultaneously disinterested in what he's saying while underlining the joke in the most eyeroll-inducing manner possible. For a dash of character, he occasionally sounds like a true man-out-of-time, with a bit of anachronistic flair reminiscent of Guru from Gang Starr. (The latter once rapped, ""like baggy slacks I'm crazy hip-hop""; the former mentions his ""True Religion trousers."") But unlike Guru, there's nothing else there; once you understand the basic 2 Chainz persona, there's no narrative, no room for introspection, no flexibility, nothing beyond the one-dimensional caricature he's crafted on countless other verses. Whether he succeeds or fails, then, relies heavily on how funny you think lines such as, ""Go so hard, Viagra try to sign me,"" really are, and ultimately, whether or not he can produce quality songs.</p>
<p>Unlike the rappers who paved the lane he's expanded to fill, 2 Chainz isn't quite as comfortable shifting through the song templates required of a flood-the-market street rapper in 2012. He can still manage the slow-burning afterparty anthem; as recently as last year, <i>Codeine Cowboy</i>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op4W3Qnq2A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Feeling You""</a> captured the smoky backroom vibe he'd perfected. With 2011's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsaxI1-tm84"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Spend It""</a>, he passed his most important test by generating a genuine peak-time club hit and even manufacturing one of the year's most incessantly memorable choruses. ""Riot"", that song's sequel, is included as a bonus track; it is a bit slight in comparison. There's a baseline of consistency to <i>Based on a T.R.U. Story</i>; some of the beats are clearly the best money can buy, from Drumma Boy's intricate ""Money Machine"" to Mike Will's frequency-filtering ""No Lie"", a major chart success that likely owes a bulk of its pop presence to Drake's guest verse. Drake and Kanye both seem to think the way to best fit in on 2 Chainz record is to be generally kind of shitty to the women they talk about, which makes each guest spot an obvious choice for their respective highlight reels.</p>
<p>Yet despite his chart success with Drake, many of 2 Chainz' pop maneuvers feel tone-deaf. Typically, The-Dream balances smooth seduction with a tackier lyrical approach by infusing it with an earnest generosity. 2 Chainz is too cynical to make it work: ""Dinner dates I demonstrate how to penetrate/ If you ain't with it, it's elimidate."" (Rimshot.) Similarly awkward attempts at stitching 2 Chainz to the pop world include Mike Posner collaboration ""In Town"" and ""Countdown"", a dubstep-ballad which contains the representative lyrical tangle, ""If love is a drug I'm arrested for your possession."" Perhaps the worst offender, though, is ""Ghetto Dreams"": John Legend's clenched-fist vocal performance and Scarface's gravitas serve only to make 2 Chainz' detached, detail-free drug raps seem all the more disconnected from anything resembling an emotional truth. The meat of <i>Based on a T.R.U. Story</i>, then, is songs like ""I Luv Dem Strippers"", ""I'm Different"", ""Feel Good"", and ""Like Me"" (which contains lyrical chestnut ""titty-fuck, CHEST NUT!""). These songs don't seem like major hits per se, but they epitomize his satisfyingly quirky, juvenile triviality. It's a much needed reprieve from the album's other primary color of mild mediocrity.</p></div>"|17092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17092-based-on-a-tru-story/|4.5|David Drake

While that's clearly a definitive event for someone in his early 20s, I'm hesitant to think of it defining Stagnant Pools as artists-- though they do come off like college kids on <i>Temporary Room,</i> though the pre-internet kind: still impressionable enough to be completely blown away by an older band with a single idea. Remember <a href=""http://simplexities.xanga.com/142724194/item/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the old Chris Rock bit</a> where he ate broccoli and cheese for the first time as a kid and thought he'd want nothing but that for the rest of his life? Replace ""broccoli"" with ""Jesus"" and ""cheese"" with ""Mary Chain"" and you're getting close to the charmingly monomaniacal focus Stagnant Pools bring to their debut, <i>Temporary Room</i>.</p>
<p>Stagnant Pools also have the youthful tendency to get canonical with their influences-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">JAMC</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26609-echo-and-the-bunnymen/"" target=""_blank"">Echo and the Bunnymen</a> are their preferred forefathers. However, I don't see Stagnant Pools putting the same emphasis on non-musical aesthetic or sneer; they register more in the style of bands that felt less like post-punk and more like post-9/11 artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4835-snowden/"" target=""_blank"">Snowden</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/655-calla/"" target=""_blank"">Calla</a>, or a far less fashionable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol/"" target=""_blank"">Interpol</a>. What I mean by that is Stagnant Pools' expertise during this early juncture is conveying an atmosphere of youthful, cosmopolitan dejection that feels metaphysically confirmed by our national mood. While engrossing as a full-length experience, at anything less than knee-buckling volumes, <i>Temporary Room </i>feels utterly impenetrable, nearly ambient. The constant whorl of distortion and Bryan's droning vocals leave <i>Temporary Room </i>hovering like a coal-black cloud on a hot day. The guitars are almost all sustain and decay, leaving the attack and release for Douglass' active drums, and often he does comply: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13659-dead-sailor/"" target=""_blank"">""Dead Sailor""</a> and ""Dreaming of You"" bash away like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a> raised on Midwestern disappointment rather than NYC entitlement, and there's enough hi-hat jittering on ""Frozen"" to make their opening gig for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2956-maximo-park/"" target=""_blank"">Maxïmo Park</a> not as bizarre as it might initially appear.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And really, <i>Temporary Room </i>is more interesting than you might get from simply surveying the elements that underpin most of the songs here-- chords almost never change between bars, the vocal melodies have the elasticity to stretch out over three-syllable words or phrases like ""devastate"" or ""maze of graves,"" the rhythms are heavy on splash cymbals and snares. The choruses are often a minor variation on the verse, a dour intonation of the title-- once these songs get going, they're like a large sailboat, not going fast per se, but only capable of making incremental changes in course. Bryan's vocals are also something of a paradox-- he's a classic mumbler, so how does he still manage to always make himself heard over music that's meant to be played loud as fuck? There might be a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2422-mark-lanegan/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Lanegan</a>-like growler trying to escape the rubble, as his melodies sound weathered and worn by truth, meant to inspire a slow nod in agreement rather than a singalong. Truth be told, it might just be a band utilizing the rules of slowcore and the velocity of punk.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sound good to you? If so, <i>Temporary Room </i>will too because it's so bent on establishing that one single mood that you tend to gloss over the individual song titles. They're here for a reason, though: ""Stun"", ""Frozen"", ""Dreaming of You"", ""Illusions"". So really, it's not a sound or even a feeling<i> </i>that <i>Temporary Room </i>advances as much as a disposition that's encoded in the song with the most self-fulfilling title of all: ""Consistency"".</p></div>"|17016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17016-temporary-room/|6.8|Ian Cohen

Their earliest albums came out in the wake of New York's no wave scene, a loose, radical contest to see who could make rock'n'roll sound as ugly as possible while still retaining the rhythms and forms that made it rock'n'roll. Swans, not central to the scene, countered with the possibility of wiping out rock altogether. The result was something that sounds sort of like monks chanting in front of a jet engine. Frontman Michael Gira once compared being in the band to ""trudging up a sand hill wearing a hair shirt, being sprayed with battery acid, with a midget taunting you""-- a description that could just as easily describe listening to them.</p>
<p>During the late 1980s and early 90s, Swans went through a goth phase, incorporating sparkly synths, reverb, acoustic guitars, and other signposts of what most people would call ""music."" But whenever things felt too comfortable, Gira would flatly drop lines like, ""You never say you know me when I'm inside you,"" or, ""I'm so glad I'm better than you are."" Beauty and ugliness have never been as relevant to their music as the possibility of turning music into a space of confrontation. In the parlance of reality television, Swans aren't-- and never have been-- here to make friends.</p>
<p>After a nearly 15-year break during which Gira focused on the dark Americana project Angels of Light, Swans reformed. Since then, they've released two albums, one studio (2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14651-my-father-will-guide-me-up-a-rope-to-the-sky/"" target=""_blank""><i>My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky</i></a>) and one live (2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16588-we-rose-from-your-bed-with-the-sun-in-our-head/"" target=""_blank""><i>We Rose From Your Bed With the Sun in Our Head</i></a>). ""[The reunion] is not repeating the past,"" Gira said in 2010. He is currently 58 years old and often photographed in a cowboy hat, not smiling. At two hours, <i>The Seer</i> is among the group's longest studio albums and, in a sweeping gesture that only the most confident and egocentric artists can pull off, it manages to expand on their sound while simultaneously summarizing everything they've ever recorded before.</p>
<p>The band's current palette includes a whole trunkload of acoustic instruments: bells, accordion, clarinet, dulcimer, a chorus of bagpipes, and what's referred to cryptically as ""handmade violin thing."" With the exception of some amplifier distortion, the album puts incredible emphasis on the human body's capacity to beat the shit out of an instrument in a far more satisfying way than machines ever could. (As an instructive gesture, Gira spends the first four-and-a-half minutes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14058-mother-of-the-world/"" target=""_blank"">""Mother of the World""</a> panting in rhythm.) Noise has never been as much of a concern in Swans' music as pure dissonance; of the way certain combinations of notes literally cause the air to vibrate more violently than others. At its most chaotic, like the climax of ""The Seer"", the band doesn't just sound aggressive, it sounds like it's bursting apart.</p>
<p>The tracks on <i>The Seer</i> aren't songs but incantations, riffs piled on riffs shifting and evolving for as long as half an hour at a time. Sometimes Gira sings; often, there's a zombie-like chorus behind him. One section fades into the next in ways more reminiscent of a soundtrack than an album, and even relatively contained tracks like ""Lunacy"" start and end with winding, immersive passages as the band comes to a boil. Like airplanes, Swans take their taxiing and descent as seriously as their flight.</p>
<p>Stylistically, the album draws a jagged line through a universe of serious, apocalyptic music, from country blues to free jazz to drone and the brutal, hypnotic guitar rock Glenn Branca and Sonic Youth made while Gira was still moaning into the void. A big group of guests are important here. Former Swan Jarboe contributes, as do Karen O, and Ben Frost on my personal favorite credit, ""fire sounds (acoustic and synthetic)."" The bigger the group, the more familial the feeling and the more heightened the illusion is that the music is not coming from inside its players but existing, like a spirit, somewhere outside and between them.</p>
<p>In the same way it would be hard to get the full experience of a good movie by only watching half of it, <i>The Seer</i> demands its two hours. To paraphrase something the author Ben Marcus said in a trenchant <a href=""http://harpers.org/archive/2005/10/0080775"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">conversation</a> with Jonathan Franzen about the value of experimental fiction, it is not a record for someone deciding whether or not they'd rather be listening to music or playing paintball. Of course this doesn't mean you need to peel off your own skin while listening to enjoy it. It has made my experience of cleaning the house, for example, feel very, very consequential.</p>
<p>At each step of Swans' career, they've been somehow tied to whatever ""dark"" genre was most culturally prominent, but <i>The Seer</i> affirms what they really are and what their legacy will probably be: A psychedelic band that rejects the musical template of psychedelia the 60s gave us. Vision has always been a metaphor for both political counterculture and religious mysticism. Prophets, pulling back the veil, ""seeing through"" things in an interest of revealing what they believe to be the raw, burning truth-- this is what Swans have always been about, and what <i>The Seer</i> seems more explicitly occupied with than anything they've ever done before.</p>
<p>Gira had come out of art school, and even Swans' most mature sounding music is rooted in the kind of catharsis through self-negation that was at the conceptual heart of 70s performance and body art. One piece from his student days involved him being blindfolded and led naked into a roomful of strangers with a tape player strapped to his body, playing a prerecorded confession of his sexual desires. The piece's coordinators had found women willing to do the same. The crux of the piece was Gira and the stranger crawling around in the room until they found each other, at which point, they'd have sex.</p>
<p>In the world of Swans, the pain of catharsis is always in service of elevating to some higher plane of being. Granted, most people probably prefer to find this in exercise and not public sex, but when sifting through Swans' apparent bleakness, it's important to recognize that their goals are and always have been to remind us of the ways extreme states of being, however intense, a unique kind of blessing. One of their live albums was called <i>Feel Good Now</i>, which is as succinct a self-summary as any artist could offer: Later, Swans bluntly suggest, you'll be dead.</p>
<p>Is this music primal? Yes. Intense? Absurdly so. On ""A Piece of the Sky"", Gira sings that ""the sun fucks the dawn."" Why the sun can't just come out normally is unclear. But there's still room for music like this, music that claws its way unapologetically toward wherever it thinks answers might be hiding. After all, without Icarus and his wings, we might never know how high the sky went or how hot the sun got. For 30 years Swans have challenged the boundaries between beauty and ugliness, music and noise, catharsis and abuse. To borrow a verb from their own violent, polarized world, <i>The Seer</i> is the album that transcends them.</p></div>"|16964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/|9.0|Mike Powell

<p class=""MsoNormal"">A couple of years ago, Britt Daniel attended a Handsome Furs show and struck up a conversation with the band's co-leader, Dan Boeckner. He half-joked that the two should start their own band, which shouldn't be surprising. If you squinted, you'd swear that ""Modern World"", most indie fans' first taste of Boeckner via <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8794-apologies-to-the-queen-mary/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Parade's 2005 debut</a>, could've been a Daniel performance. Five years later, on ""Written in Reverse"" and ""Got Nuffin"", Daniel tried on a ragged, blues-derived yowl that seemed pulled straight from Boeckner's own boozy playbook. The comparisons go on: Both frontmen are masculine but not macho. Both can sell lyrics like, ""When you believe, they call it rock'n'roll,"" and, ""it was a torch driving the savages back to the trees,"" with utter sincerity and no trace of cheese. When Boeckner found himself without a band after the Furs' 2011 dissolution, it only seemed right to join forces. From March to May of this year, the two decamped in a Los Angeles recording studio with New Bomb Turks drummer Sam Brown, keyboardist Alex Fischel, and producer Nick Launay to knock out <i>A Thing Called Divine Fits</i>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">At a time when bedroom artists are free to release .zip archives of whatever was on their mind last week, and inter-album dead zones are marked by interest-maintaining live ""sessions,"" a project like Divine Fits might feel like a decadent 1970s version of that precarious line in rock lore between restless creativity and sheer indulgence. Though he's adamant to distance himself <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/divine-fits-chat-about-lame-supergroups-and-their-very-real-band"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">from the Paleolithic term ""supergroup,""</a> for Daniel, the project would seem to tip toward the indulgent. His primary band is not only commercially successful, but it's been cruising at a creative peak without dipping for more than a decade now. His contributions to <i>Fits</i> testify to the fact that with Spoon, he owns an indie rock lane so completely that anyone who even ventures over to the left side of the piano risks having to pay a royalty.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">None of Daniel's contributions are as risky or instant-classic sounding as the best Spoon songs, but I'm not exactly complaining. B+ Britt Daniel is still really good. ""Flaggin a Ride"" (is there a more Classic Rock song title?) seems to be written about Daniel asking Boeckner to collaborate, over a rhythm track that sounds like something he's been sitting on for years. On the co-penned ""What Gets You Alone"", Daniel backs Boeckner's lyrics with a tune that merges the hard driving ""Jonathan Fisk"" with the acoustic shredder ""Sister Jack"". Daniel also provides the album's only cover, a version of the Boys Next Door's goth classic ""Shivers"", which he wears like a glove.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For Boeckner, however, the stakes feel much higher. A career collaborator, he's played the glammed-out hesher to Spencer Krug's yowling mystic in the permanently hiatused Wolf Parade, and allowed Alexei Perry's art-damaged electronic wizardry to drive Handsome Furs into straight-up synth-pop territory by the time of that group's 2011 swan song. Whereas Spoon is the model of indie rock stability and consistency, Boeckner's career has been rewarding in its unpredictability. He more than rises to the occasion. <i>A Thing Called Divine</i> <i>Fits</i> might seem the Platonic ideal of indie rock collaboration, but the most memorable moments have Boeckner's signature.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On the woozy, swaggering ""Baby Get Worse"", the guy who penned ""This Heart's on Fire"" mixes artistic and romantic separation anxieties, pleading, ""my heart was beating in and out of time."" On the taut, pulsating opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46917-spoons-britt-daniel-wolf-parades-dan-boeckner-share-debut-single-as-divine-fits/"" target=""_blank"">""My Love is Real""</a>, Boeckner adopts Daniel's gift for space and concision, while the song's refrain (""My love is real/ Until it stops"") manages to be both highly practical and vaguely threatening. Love dies, but the question of who does the killing is left unanswered. The suicide of Russian futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky and Roman Polanski's dark relationship psychodrama <i>Knife in the Water</i> both make cameo appearances for good measure, and the song's over in less than three minutes. On the other end of the spectrum, the stripped-down sincerity of ""Civilian Stripes"" is an achingly pretty acoustic number detailing the quiet dignity of rejoining the straight world. Boeckner pins his heart on his sleeve while Daniel stays in the cut, contributing only a minimalist piano bridge between the two verses. It's a perfectly sequenced quiet moment for the album, and ranks among the quickly growing list of Boeckner's finest performances.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Down to its tongue-in-cheek title, <i>A Thing Called Divine Fits</i> can seem at first blush like a one-off vanity project, two experienced mechanics building a hot rod in a garage over a few weekends, or two NBA players meeting up for summer pickup ball. Daniel and Boeckner both claim it's an ongoing project, however, and rock fans should hope they stick to their promise. Like Mary Timony teaming up with two-thirds of Sleater-Kinney for Wild Flag, it's a match too good to be true, and-- particularly considering the sad state of Modern Rock in 2012-- far too promising to let die.</p>

The circumstances are sadly familiar to those surrounding his last truly great record, 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7808-the-bcoming/"" target=""_blank""><i>The B. Coming</i></a>, which he recorded in the time remaining before he served a year and a day for federal weapons charges. Things weren't exactly rosy for the Philly rapper back then, but in the rearview they look like salad days: He was still affiliated with Roc-A-Fella, still privy to a house-production roster that included Just Blaze. He hadn't yet lashed out at his former benefactor and label boss <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z</a>, isolating himself with a series of diss tracks that sounded more like weepy drunk dials than insults. Few have fallen as hard or as far as Beanie.</p>
<p>For his longtime fans, then, <i>This Time</i> is poignant, not least of all because Beanie still sounds like himself: one of the hardest-hitting, soulful, and eloquent rappers of the last 15 years. The production surrounding him on <i>This Time</i> isn't just cheap-sounding, it's unimaginative, rote and generic, like Beanie prepared his verses ahead of time and then spent an afternoon matching them to random instrumentals sitting on his hard drive. He has always quoted Biggie liberally, but some of these raps are more Biggie quote than Beanie verse. It's a rushed affair from start to finish, and it mostly serves to demonstrate the degree to which this great rapper has isolated himself.</p>
<p>And yet, his voice cuts through all of this static. Beanie raps with bruising force and sneakily creative cadences, and his verses are things of beauty on paper as well. He writes with hard economy about his two great subjects: poverty and desperation, pointing out to listeners the ""teddy bears where niggas got took out"" on his streets, letting his gaze fall on the old heads ""sitting on crates, taking 40s to the face."" He once memorably told listeners that he ""ate sleep for dinner"" most nights, and he has always written about scarcity with the vividness of someone who recalls that hunger still: ""He can't hear what they teaching him in school, 'cause his stomach too loud, screaming, 'I need food,'"" he raps on ""Bang Bang Youth"".</p>
<p>For a rapper who has always let us into his darkest, innermost thoughts, however, from the harrowing scared-straight prison classic ""What Ya Life Like"" through ""Feel It in the Air"", <i>This Time</i> is disappointingly skimpy on personal details. He briefly acknowledges the ups and downs of the last few years on the title track-- ""I went from caviar dreams to champagne sippin'/ Back to Four Lokos/ Four wings fried crispy""-- but apart from that, <i>This Time</i> is full of bars that Beanie could have written at any point in the last two or 10 years. Beanie has always threatened your life with more loving detail than just about any other rapper, and for connoisseurs of goonery, there are memorable lines here, like this helpful tutorial he provides on ""Bad Boy Mack"" on how to distinguish him from Craig Mack: ""He put flava in ya ear/ I put a laser to your head."" ""No Hook"", which nicks its reflexive hook, awkwardly, from the Jay-Z song of the same name, is first-class face-scrunch music. But to emerge from the hole his career has fallen into, Beanie needed to have dug deeper. <i>This Time</i> mostly serves as a reminder of why he's troubled more than why he's great.</p></div>"|17071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17071-this-time/|6.0|Jayson Greene

Although a typically direct pop song in the Hot Chip idiom on paper, ""Flutes"" is a queasy and uneven thing on record, a transformation achieved mainly thanks to its careful use of a sound that I had previously mentally filed under Fake's name in my head. That sound-- a gently keening psychedelic wail, deployed via dial rather than sample trigger-- hallmarked the early Fake single ""The Sky Was Pink"" and instantly provided him with something not many electronic musicians ever get; an original claim in the ongoing electronic music sound patent wars.</p>
<p>It's a natural tendency for listeners to reduce some electronic musicians to signature sounds or moments in our heads, which is why, even eight years after ""The Sky Was Pink"", I wouldn't be at all surprised if that particular sound was still the first thing that came to mind for lots of people familiar with Fake's work. Following on 2006's effervescent <i>Drowning in a Sea of Love</i> and 2009's rougher-edged <i>Hard Islands</i>, the newly released <i>Steam Days</i> probably won't do anything to change that, nor will it do much to get Fake out of the (now ironically) decaying ghetto of bucolic, pastoral electronic music that he helped re-colonize in the latter half of the last decade. But if the small refinements here are anything to go by, it's hard to imagine that Fake cares much about any of that at all.  </p>
<p>If <i>Drowning in a Sea of Love</i> exhibited a pre-occupation with fizzy synth melodies and <i>Hard Islands</i> with naked, almost brutal, rhythms, <i>Steam Days</i> is all about the synthesis of those two sides. With its glowing, organ-led refrain and clattering percussions, opener ""Paean"" establishes a marriage between melody and rhythm that more or less stays intact throughout. ""Old Light"" and ""Harnser"" offset coarse drum patterns with tasteful dollops of melody. Meanwhile, with its psych-tinged synths and counterbalanced time signatures, single ""Iceni Strings"" aims to strike the same notes of gut-wrenching unease as ""The Sky Was Pink"", albeit in a slightly more muted fashion.  </p>
<p>This low-key approach runs throughout <i>Steam Days</i> and inadvertently adds up to make a comment on this particular genre of electronic music. In a context removed from any sort of cultural relevance or baggage, you could reasonably argue that this is Fake's most well-rounded record to date; the bigger question is whether such small refinements to such an established, well-trodden genre should merit attention from anyone other than diehards at this stage in the game. Never mind that a few of the track titles sounded like they were produced by a nostalgic IDM fake track name generator (""Sad Vember"" and ""Warble Epics""-- gah), it's telling that the two highlights here (the komische synth burner ""Rue"" and hip-hop inflected <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14054-neketona/"" target=""_blank"">""Neketona""</a>) are the ones that most readily evoke the ghost of those longest of shadow-casters, Boards of Canada. Bottom line is that this is hugely referential music made for what feels like a dwindling subset of fans; I hope those guys still have some wistfulness in the tank.  </p></div>"|16966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16966-steam-days/|6.2|Mark Pytlik

A ""supergroup"" only in the most local sense, this Pacific Northwest quartet represents a who's who of acts regional and national: Singer/guitarist/primary songwriter Christian Wargo has played with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/more/?query=pedro%20the%20lion&amp;filter=album_reviews"">Pedro the Lion</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/more/?query=danielson%20famile&amp;filter=album_reviews"">Danielson Famile</a>, Casey Wescott with Crystal Skulls, and Ian Murray and Peter Murray with Seattle un-Googleables the Christmas Cards. But let's not bury the lede: The closest and weightiest association is with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/more/?query=fleet%20foxes&amp;filter=album_reviews"">Fleet Foxes</a>, which claims both Wargo and Wescott as prominent members.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's inevitable that Poor Moon will be compared to Fleet Foxes, which would be a daunting prospect for any band but especially for an offshoot. Their aesthetics and approaches are strikingly similar, right down to the gentle reverb and some of the record-collection touchstones: Crosby Stills &amp; Nash, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4153-judee-sill/"">Judee Sill</a>, Buffy Sainte-Marie, to name a few. Every song on <i>Poor Moon</i> turns on some sonic flourish or instrumental shift that occasionally comes across as showy but more often than not works well to give each song a distinctive identity, whether it's the chimes and celeste on ""Bucky Pony"" or the whistled birdsong of the too-precious opener ""Clouds Below"". There are certainly moments that sound suspiciously familiar, like the reverb-swaddled vocals on ""Holiday"" or the soft crash of drums and guitar on ""Same Way"". <i>Poor Moon</i> either shows how closely Wargo and Wescott hew to the Fleet Foxes approach or demonstrates how essential they are to that band's celebrated sound.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As a songwriter, Wargo, however, lacks the specificity of Robin Pecknold's outdoorsy self-reckoning, which has lent Fleet Foxes' history-mining efforts a strong sense of purpose and poignancy. By contrast, Poor Moon sound gauzier of mission, as though re-creating certain pop-historical sounds was their endgame. Lyrically, Wargo tends to get bogged down in barely told stories and overarching concepts, like the overly familiar afterlife of ""Heaven's Door"". Musically it sounds like they're snoozing the Strawberry Alarm Clock, but strangely there's no heft to the idea of paying ""for the sins that I love too much."" At least he sneaks in an offhand Grateful Dead reference when he admits, ""Got the friend of the devil living in my soul.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Wargo's lyrics are fine but largely ignorable, which may have less to do with the words themselves than with how they are delivered. He sounds like an adenoidal Art Garfunkel, his voice high and clear and precise. That's not a slam or anything; Garfunkel was, by nearly everybody's estimation, a better singer than Simon. But there's not a lot of emotional range there, no strain to accentuate a thought or a feeling, just a drowsy introspection that runs the length of the album somewhat monotonously. In other words, it's hard to view Poor Moon as anything but a side project-- not worthless, but dramatically overshadowed. Lord knows there are tons of similar enterprises in rock history, some crummy (Tin Machine, SuperHeavy) and some rivaling their members' main outlets (the Postal Service, the Dead Weather). At the moment, Poor Moon lies somewhere in between those two poles.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But there is promise here: This full-length reveals a unit much surer of purpose than we heard on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16438-illusion-ep/""><span class=""s1""><i>Illusion</i></span></a>, the free EP the band released earlier this year. These songs are gutsier in their arrangements, more surefooted in the songwriting, and more certain of the band's identity. ""Waiting For"" may be the band's boldest and most heraldic chorus, at once assertive and-- thanks to Wargo's delicate vocals-- retreating. At times there is an intriguing disconnect between the tone of the lyrics and the tone of the arrangements, and that dissonance can be jarring, even invigorating: ""I couldn't keep it silent, I didn't know that sadness could be so violent,"" Wargo sings on ""Pulling Me Down"", but neither the music nor the melody sounds sad or violent. Rather than coming off as gutless, that contrast bends the tune's exclamation point into a disquieting question mark.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Poor Moon</i> ends quietly with ""Birds"", whose harmonies and chord progressions recall Foxes but whose momentum flutters off into the air. It's a rather abrupt and unceremonious conclusion that does little to suggest a shape or story in the album. <i>Poor Moon</i> turns out to be a wisp of a record, intentionally light and certainly promising but also oddly-- and perhaps ironically-- weightless. </p></div>"|16968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16968-poor-moon/|5.9|Stephen M.

Before then, he'd been heard by almost no one, despite that he'd recorded hundreds of songs, by himself, in what sounded like a windowless dungeon. The quality of those early recordings was poor, but something shone from the murk: Pink became the first artist signed to the band's <a href=""http://www.paw-tracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paw Tracks</a> label, which reissued his album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6553-the-doldrums/"" target=""_blank"">The Doldrums</a></i> in 2004. The path of his career since then has been wayward and strange, culminating in the highly professional <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14324-before-today/"" target=""_blank""><i>Before Today</i></a> in 2010. But there are through-lines. Whether you tuned into his world during the Paw Tracks era or after <i>Before Today</i>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11846-round-and-round/"" target=""_blank"">""Round and Round""</a> became an indie anthem, you probably sensed an intriguing off-note lurking in the L.A. home-recording savant's music. </p>
<p>In Pink's hands, the boundless sunshine of 1970s AM pop grows queasy, even malevolent, splitting the difference between a grimace, a smirk, and a smile. Even at its loveliest, his music radiates a mesmerizing sense of bad faith: Pink often incorporates humor into his songs, but it's hard to be sure if you're in on the joke. He may express seemingly sincere sentiments in one moment while mocking them in the next. In his most compelling material, these impulses curl around each other until his ""fuck you's"" sound like ""I love you"", and vice versa. </p>
<p><i>Before Today</i> was Ariel Pink's breakout record, a leap to a new stage from his cult beginnings that made his skill as a songwriter and craftsman clear. Free of the lo-fi grit that characterized his Paw Tracks material, you could suddenly hear his uncanny knack for fusing together unlikely parts with no visible seams. <i>Mature Themes</i>, Pink's grittier, gristlier, and funnier follow-up, clarifies that <i>Before Today</i> was not a sign of things to come but rather just a signpost along his unknowable path. The production has hardened, as if Pink has found a midpoint between the warped, warbly sound of his tape releases and what he can now afford. The songs themselves, while still catchy, are often opaque, antisocial, and confounding. The mood of the record veers closer to the melted emotional nowhere of <i>The Doldrums</i>' ""Good Kids Make Bad Grown Ups"" or the arch piss-take of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6554-worn-copy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Worn Copy</i></a>'s ""Artifact"".</p>
<p>As a result, some have pegged <i>Mature Themes</i> as an alienating move meant to prune Pink's flock back down to the diehards. But the album is too rich for that straightforward reading. Here, even his puerile sentiments remain generously melodic and lovingly wrought. ""I'm not real and I won't call you,"" he croons on the title track, over a melody that climbs upward so gracefully it sounds like he's vandalizing a Shaker hymn. It might be one of the truest lines he's ever sung. But the Elvis Costello-like rising-action of the chorus, which takes the phrase ""I wanted to be good"" up the scale, is an expression of love, pure and simple. </p>
<p>""Only in My Dreams"" is another example of his singular songwriting mind: Listen casually and it's a Byrdsian pop tune, but sit down at a piano to map out it's details, and you'll lean back, baffled. If taken apart, no one but Pink would be able to reassemble it. It's this talent that links Pink to past practicioners of outsider music-- <a href=""http://www.rsteviemoore.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R. Stevie Moore</a>, <a href=""http://www.zappa.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Frank Zappa</a>, <a href=""http://www.ween.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ween</a>. Like those artists, Pink looked at the puzzle pieces of a pop song and figured out jarring new ways they fit together, mingling affection with ironic commentary and intellectual distance. ""Kinski Assassin"" opens with Pink singing nonsense in a stentorian voice not far from a 1930s radio drama: ""Suicide dumplings dropping testicle bombs."" Then, he chimes in with something silky and romantic: ""We'll always have Paris."" The lyrics don't make any more sense together than the music behind them does, but they glide smoothly into each other, conveying a strong sense of internal coherence. It's the kind of bewitching almost-logic that drives people to endlessly re-watch David Lynch's <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166924/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Mulholland Drive</i></a> or <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460829/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Inland Empire</i></a>.</p>
<p>But don't look to Pink's lyrics for clues, because they offer few ways to emotionally engage. ""The bad breath of a cross-eyed goat/ Eating children for a Monday morning,"" go the opening lines of ""Driftwood"", intoned with the seriousness of a Druid. On ""Symphony of the Nymph"", he speak-sings the song's title in an exaggerated scientist voice straight out of <a href=""http://www.thomasdolby.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Dolby</a>'s catalogue over a backing track located somewhere between ""Monster Mash"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6V2oCX3Hn4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Werewolf Bar Mitzvah</a>"". On ""Farewell American Primitive"", the sentiment that comes through most clearly is, ""Fuck it."" It's moments like these that forcefully remind you: There's nothing operatic at stake in Pink's music. It's a Chinese finger trap.</p>
<p>When <a href=""http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-05-11/music/ariel-pink-gives-us-the-creeps/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Village Voice</i></a> interviewed Pink in 2010, he suggested that he'd lost the ability to make music the way he did in his earlier, more prolific days. But <i>Mature Themes</i> is as vital as anything he's ever recorded: Even the throwaway ""Schnitzel Boogie"" fails at being one-dimensional, playing instead like something McCartney might have worked on for the fifth side of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13432-the-beatles/"" target=""_blank"">White Album</a>. This seesaw between sincerity and insincerity is the fuel that drives Pink's music. It's the riddle that creates his cult, and it's the reason everyone will continue to pay attention to him, no matter how many faces he pulls.</p></div>"|16936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16936-mature-themes/|8.5|Jayson Greene

If you've ever enjoyed the records of Pink Floyd or Randy Newman, Spiritualized or Wilco, the dozen gems here move between similar poles of spartan grace and outsized grandeur. The organ-abetted lilt of ""The Healing Day"" suggests Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett turning the page toward happiness a decade ago, while the gospel choir delivering the mantra of ""Be at Peace with Yourself"" might make you scan the credits for a J. Spaceman acknowledgment. The flinty ""Empires"" is a piano-led political tune written from a distance and with a dark, Newman-like wit, where the world's biggest timbers eventually yield to the teeming underbrush beneath. Its warped tones and terse delivery suggest Roger Waters coming back to Earth. Beautiful, patient and poignant, <i>Life Is People</i> is an expert singer-songwriter album, as dependent upon keen insight as it is upon meticulous arrangement.</p>
<p>But a history lesson makes <i>Life Is People</i> that much more meaningful. Bill Fay is 69 years old, and he hasn't released a proper studio album since his second, 1971's brilliant and acerbic <i>Time of the Last Persecution</i>. He'd stumbled into a recording contract with the Decca Nova/Deram imprint. As he <a href=""http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2011/06/an-interview-with-bill-fay-part-two-starting-a-career-deram-records.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admitted to WFMU </a>in an interview last year, labels at that point scooped up an abundance of acts, hoping that at least something would turn into a best seller. ""Somebody told me at the time,"" he said, ""that their policy was to throw as many pieces of mud as possible at the wall, and hope that some would stick."" Fay's records didn't stick, however, and neither did he. Deram dropped Fay and, in the 41 years since <i>Persecution</i>, he's recorded new material and consistently written new songs but never finished a complete record. Music, as he also <a href=""http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2011/06/an-interview-with-bill-fay-part-one-childhood-and-early-influences.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told WFMU</a>, was a private family affair for him as a child, with his aunts and uncles playing together and his mom occasionally sitting down at the family piano; he performed several times, but largely it seemed that, after stumbling toward fame through music, he wanted to keep the stuff to himself.</p>
<p>It was too late, though. Based only on the strength of those first two records and reissues, sporadic batches of leaked demos, and a terribly teasing collection called <i>Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow</i>, issued 30 years after it was recorded, Fay's cult standing grew. Wilco covered ""Be Not So Fearful"", the gorgeous affirmation from his debut, and convinced Fay to join them onstage in 2007 and later during a 2010 Tweedy solo set. Then, last summer, Fay returned to a London studio for the first time in three decades with American producer Joshua Henry, a lifelong Fay fan who'd barely been alive for 30 years. With a band comprised of younger studio players and Ray Russell and Alan Rushton, who'd joined Fay for <i>Persecution</i> so long ago, they recorded the bulk of <i>Life Is People </i>in a little less than a month.</p>
<p>And now, back to the present: <i>Life Is People</i> doesn't feel at all like a late-life afterthought from a cult hero. Pointed and urgent but never pushy, Fay's songs offer pleas for redemption in a world drunk on its promise, coupled with a reassuring contentment for simply having lived this life. Fay chastises the way generations have refused to learn from their history, even as we stare into devices that allegedly offer all the answers we'd ever need. On the other hand, ""Be at Peace With Yourself"" extends existential reassurance-- that is, as Fay offers behind a tabernacle-sized mix of organ and choir arrangements, whoever you are is probably good enough. That's a thought echoed on ""The Healing Day"", a tender Revelation hymn that depends upon the belief that some cosmic help is always on the horizon. ""Every battleground/ Is a place for sheep to graze,"" Fay sings during one his most eloquent bits ever. ""When it all comes tumbling down/ All the palaces and parades.""</p>
<p>But the record's two key songs, ""The Never Ending Happening"" and ""This World"", provide a crucial bridge between Fay's indignation and optimism. On the former, Fay's voice hang's worn but resilient above a simple, elliptical piano line; in these perfect four minutes, he considers death, God, birth, bird song, and war cries as one continuum. He's happy to have been involved, he admits, to have his tiny narrative shape a much bigger story: ""Just to be part of it/ Is astonishing to me."" The record's pop standout, ""This World"" springs from the somber end of ""The Never Ending Happening"" as if to offer the message that, appreciative as he may be, Fay isn't done quite yet. He and Wilco's Jeff Tweedy trade the verses and share the chorus, their simpatico voices both showing the signs and struggles of survival. (Fay also lands a wrenching solo cover of ""Jesus, Etc."" here, his voice turning Tweedy's resignation into observational candor.) As they dole out experiences with blue-collar worries and dismiss the corner drug dealer who offers ""an easy way out,"" they sound enthused, as if overcoming the worries of the world is its own substantive reward for living. Though he's a quarter-century older, Fay temporarily lends Tweedy an energy that recalls the transition from Uncle Tupelo to Wilco. They're having fun.</p>
<p>In the past decade, a number of serpentine stories and bittersweet circumstances have revitalized the careers of musicians who, for whatever reason, were swallowed by the record industry and largely ignored by the world. To varying degrees, soul singers like Bettye LaVette, Solomon Burke, and Charles Bradley found ways to turn long flirtations with fame (or abject failure) into real or revived careers with new records on indie imprints. Thanks to collaborations with young producer Kieran Hebden, drummer Steve Reid finally became more than a footnote of rock and jazz history; when Bert Jansch linked with Drag City and Devendra Banhart, the inspiration to Led Zeppelin and what had become New Weird America met a fresh generation of listeners. <i>Life Is People</i> and the tale that accompany it are strong enough to do the same for Fay, to at last make his reputation among many match his legacy among few. ""There are miracles in the strangest of places,"" Fay sings at the start of the title track's seven-minute ascent, setting the scene for the string of tiny triumphs he sweetly lists. At the risk of overstating the case, <i>Life Is People</i>—the work of a 69-year-old family man, and the work of a lifetime—confirms its maker's own thesis.</p></div>"|17012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17012-life-is-people/|8.0|Grayson Currin

Ohio is in the Ohioan's blood, so naturally it's also in his sharp, understated lyrics: the culture, the terrain, the people, the place of the place. <i>Occasion For Song</i>, the latest full-length by his band <a href=""http://theblackswans.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Black Swans</a>, is perhaps his most geographically defined album yet, a long drive through the state's haunted sites. Over there's where a friend died. Years ago he buried his sister's pet crab near that tree. ""Played mailbox baseball three miles from here,"" he sings on ""Where Are You Tonight?"" ""I never got caught but the guilt never disappeared."" His Ohio is a land of inescapable memories, with a trigger for reminiscence-- some long-past occasion for song-- on every street corner. DeCicca is a careful, precise songwriter, but the songs don't necessarily sound written. Instead, they seem like they occurred to him naturally and ineluctably.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Perhaps the biggest trigger for him in the entire Buckeye State is a diving board and swimming pool in Portsmouth, down on the Kentucky border. There are likely thousands of pools like it across the country, but this one-- which appears on the cover of <i>Occasion For Song</i>-- is special: On a sunny day in the middle of summer 2008, Black Swans violinist Noel Sayre jumped off that diving board and into that pool, and somewhere along the way suffered a massive heart attack. He died a few days later. It's impossible to overstate the impact that occasion has had on the Black Swans' music since then, but DeCicca addresses it directly for the first time on ""Portsmouth, Ohio"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">The song is not just a standout on the album, but a standout for 2012. Absenting himself from the narrative in a way that prevents it from being mawkish or maudlin, DeCicca adopts a third-person perspective as he relates not just the death but the full life of his friend: ""Nobody's supposed to die three days before the 4th of July, especially while the sun's still in the sky,"" he sings, mustering the necessary stoicism to make it through the line. Even if you never met Sayre, and for that matter even if you've never heard the Black Swans before, it's hard not to be moved by this tune, whose power derives from its measured storytelling and hushed tone. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Occasion For Song, </i>however, is more about DeCicca than Sayre. It's more about living with death than about death, although the Black Swans do pose some disquieting questions about mortality. There are dark threads stitching these songs together, unapologetic admissions of extreme introversions, alienation, aimlessness, resignation. On ""Basket of Light"", he confesses, ""I was hungry, I was dry, I walked a cliff called suicide."" And that's the leadoff track. The whole thing might be dour and morbid, but DeCicca has lately been indulging his fascination with country music, which has opened his songwriting up considerably over the past few years. It was perhaps most prominent on 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15543-dont-blame-the-stars/"" target=""_blank"">Don't Blame the Stars</a></i>,<i> </i>which had the giddy-up of prime <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6229-roger-miller/"" target=""_blank"">Roger Miller</a>. If that song had the jumpy feel of long days on the road, <i>Occasion For Song</i> sounds like even longer days at home. </p>
<p class=""p1"">DeCicca's veer toward country is aided by the Black Swans themselves, who back him with subtlety and sympathy. Chris Forbes' electric guitar adds pointed commentary to ""Basket of Light"" and ""Portsmouth, Ohio"", while Jon Beard's organ adds an undercurrent of concern, reinforcing the sad truth that time cannot be reversed and tragedy cannot be averted. If <i>Occasion For Song</i> is about rising out of a dark period in life, the band makes it clear that music is the impetus for that hesitant recovery, especially on ""Daily Affirmation"", with its agile banjo solo and its bright energy to contrast with darker, quieter songs. For all its grave intimations, <i>Occasion For Song</i> exhibits a true joy in creating and playing music, in finding the right notes and the right words.

In 1976, she had made enough to fund her debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15659-love-has-made-me-stronger/"" target=""_blank""><i>Love Has Made Me Stronger</i></a>, which was reissued on Drag City last year. By the time she got ready to record a follow-up at the tail end of the decade, she said, ""I'd developed a following at the faires and on the street corners, and felt like I'd actually earned the title: Harpist/Singer/Songwriter."" That's her writing in the liner notes for the reissue of her second album, 1980's <i>Takin' the Time</i>. It's a telling statement, not only because this humble, self-taught musician asserts her identity so forcefully, but primarily because it reveals exactly how she thought of herself. She was first and foremost a harpist, a vocalist second, and lastly a songwriter.</p>
<p>Both of these reissues bear out that impression and especially that order, which is not to say that Kleyn was a deficient singer or songwriter. It's just that the harp dominates, as much by its size as by its sound. Kleyn toted the thing everywhere, and the sight of the diminutive, sunny-faced California blonde hauling such an instrument, her dog trustily at her feet, must have left a visual impression on passers-by as strong as the music she played. How odd, then, that <i>Takin' the Time</i> begins not with the sounds of her folksy plucking and strumming, but with the rambling riff of a full band. Produced by her former romantic and musical partner Bobby Brown (whose <i>Enlightening Beam of Axonda</i> ought to be next on Drag City's reissue schedule), <i>Takin' the Time</i> places Kleyn in a variety of settings, and the most disarming is at the front of an electrified rock group.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily a bad sound for her, although her voice does get lost in the relative squall of ""Jethro"". But the band sounds a bit prim, as though hesitant to cut loose with such a delicate voice at the fore. And still, Kleyn manages to make the title track sound sweetly pastoral, as she sings about the small pleasures of domestic life as she lived it: ""Making love in a yellow school bus/ Tall eucalyptus around us."" Even when she deals in hippie ephemera-- one song involves a unicorn, another invokes ""the song of the harp""-- Kleyn can be a disarmingly descriptive lyricist, evoking the world around her in softly concrete imagery.</p>
<p>Brown's production is light and naturalistic, which, especially on the second side, creates an intimate space for Kleyn. She's accompanied solely by what sounds like a thumb piano on ""How Long Till Forever"", and a flock of sympathetic seagulls joins in on ""Prayer"". What initially sounds like steel drums darting around the island rhythms of ""Sailor Take Me"" soon reveals itself to be Kleyn's harp, a clever and startling sonic transformation made all the more impressive by the fact that it sounds undoctored.</p>
<p>By the time the needle starts circling the label on the first side, the band has packed up its gear and left the stage, leaving Kleyn mostly alone to accompany herself on harp. Here's where she truly shines, as the staccato plucks and pastoral glissandi of the instrument nicely contrast her sweetly high-pitched vocals. Adventurous and wide-eyed, <i>Takin' the Time</i> is nevertheless much more professional and consistent than <i>Love Has Made Me Stronger</i>, yet it lacks the homemade aesthetic of that debut-- the impression of a young artist finding her own unique voice and style-- and therefore much of its offhand charm. Still, Kleyn proves a warmly intuitive and self-possessed musician, and some of the best moments here are also the smallest and humblest: Pay attention to her vocals as she sustains her notes on ""She Lost Her Crown"", striking a homespun vibrato that buoys the verses. Or listen to the way her voice cracks subtly as she soars up to a high note on ""Prayer"". Moments like these make <i>Takin' the Time</i> sound like the work of a lively personality, one who obviously loved hauling that harp around and seeing what she could do with it.</p></div>"|17015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17015-takin-the-times/|7.4|Stephen M.

Comparing the two with distinct caution, it makes sense for Macpherson to cite Henry Miller's second semi-autobiographical tract, in which he continued to figure out his voice as a writer, only to abandon it among the sweaty dregs of a relationship: Spector are the latest and most successful Macpherson vehicle. The other band members are never interviewed; one is a model. This new incarnation follows his bands Ox.Eagle.Lion.Man-- less remembered for their songs than being cited in Daily Mail stories about Macpherson dating Peaches Geldof-- and Les Incompetents, who released the excellent single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95t4O6ggyoU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How It All Went Wrong""</a> back in 2006.</p>
<p>Macpherson gets self-referential on ""Upset Boulevard""-- ""Rewind all your favorite songs/ Remind yourself <i>how it went wrong</i>/ Discuss the good times with your friends/ You'll never be 19 again."" He once <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/24/indie-music-back-to-2007"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told <i>The Guardian</i></a>, ""There was a certain passion or venom [in music] in 2003 that seems to have been replaced with hyper self-awareness and timidity."" Spector's M.O. is to hark back to what he perceives as a halcyon time of titting about in indie discos in East London, although the songs are nowhere near as good as anything on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2368-the-killers/"" target=""_blank"">the Killers</a>' <i>Hot Fuss</i>, or even the relatively charming debuts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3644-razorlight/"" target=""_blank"">Razorlight</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2383-kaiser-chiefs/"" target=""_blank"">Kaiser Chiefs</a>. The lack of venom that Macpherson laments fails to materialize in his latest attempt at a writer's voice, which is just a conduit for weak lyrics-- girls and boys never want the same thing at the same time, poor Fred jilted by promiscuous socialite as if he's so pure, repeat, repeat, repeat-- but <a href=""http://www.nme.com/nme-video/the-wisdom-of-spectors-fred-macpherson/1720986207001"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">professional ambition</a> far supersedes the band's creative ability.</p>
<p>Spector come from a modern UK ""indie"" culture of lowered expectations-- calling the LP <i>Enjoy It While It Lasts</i> implies an awareness of the futility and fleetingness of it all, as does the title of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29550-the-vaccines/"" target=""_blank"">the Vaccines</a>' debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15406-what-did-you-expect-from-the-vaccines/"" target=""_blank""><i>What Did You Expect From…</i></a> These titles are flimsy suits of armor to ensure that the records can't fail, because the implication is their creators never expected them to succeed or tried very hard at them in the first place. </p>
<p>Macpherson is an erudite, charming personality and he's capable of writing stronger, pithier songs than this; just listen again to ""How It All Went Wrong"" for proof of the fact from when he was just 16 or 17 years old. But the songs on <i>Enjoy It While It Last</i>s are chugging, overwrought, and comically theatrical in a painful fashion, lowest common denominator fodder. Unsurprisingly, the record went in at No. 12 in the UK album charts on Sunday. (Though UK album sales <i>are</i> at an all-time low-- Rihanna's <i>Talk That Talk</i> went back to No. 1 the weekend before with <a href=""http://www.popjustice.com/thenews/rihannas-album-sold-less-than-10000-copies-to-get-to-number-one-this-week/98068/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sales of only 9,578</a>.) As fame is apparently his fix, Macpherson's spoken patter would be better suited to a career as a television presenter; being in a band only mutes his rhetorical ability, though his commitment to the musical cause emphasizes what's at least a British trend, where so-called ""indie"" (Spector's label Fiction is owned by Polydor, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group) now constitutes its own strain of showbiz.</p>
<p>But whatever their intentions, what's really striking is how <i>truly terrible</i> this record is. The production is full of dreadful pitch-shifts, senseless electronic filigrees, widdly guitar solos that don't fit anywhere, cavernous reverb chambers to disguise the weakness of Macpherson's toneless voice. If Bay City Rollers-style shouting atop early Killers rejects with a hint of Denim sounds bad in theory, try ""Chevy Thunder"" for size, a spruced-up Springsteen, faux-Americana tale of ""let's get outta here"" bombast. That song's final hurrah is a slow, theatrical outpouring that sounds as if it were recorded in a church-- complete with painful whiffs of violin-- the first of many baffling, sonorous ballads here that sound more like the ""X Factor"" semi-final grab for sympathy than anything you'd associate with five spindly east London boys. That doesn't make Spector diverse; it makes <i>Enjoy It While It Lasts</i> a hot mess.</p></div>"|17082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17082-enjoy-it-while-it-lasts/|2.6|Laura Snapes

First Damon Albarn <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/46063-damon-albarn-says-no-more-blur-gorillaz/"">announced</a> that, after a performance at the Olympic Closing Ceremony Concert in Hyde Park, the long-lived, notoriously volatile band would be calling it a day. A few weeks later Albarn <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/46294-blur-and-gorillaz-may-live-again-albarn-says/"">backpedaled</a> and said that wasn't necessarily the case (""Some days I feel one way and other days I feel the other.""). Then, in what felt like a definitive mark in the ""stay together for the kids"" column, they released a <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13830-under-the-westway/"" target=""_blank"">pair of singles</a>. Preliminary sessions were underway for a new album; then the album was scrapped. So, when the band insists that that Hyde Park performance, now immortalized as a live album called <i>Parklive</i>, will indeed be its last, they can forgive us for feeling a little skeptical. And dizzy.</p>
<p>Hurried out to iTunes a day after the Closing Ceremony show and following a recent avalanche of archival releases, <i>Parklive</i> comes to us as speedily and inevitably as a Usain Bolt 100-meter victory. Still, thanks to the clear and appropriately bombastic mix, <i>Parklive</i> certainly doesn't <i>sound</i> like a rush job. In fact, judging by all the tweets from the cheap seats complaining about Hyde Park's soundsystem (and the boos audible to my ears when Albarn asks early in the set if they can hear him in the back), <i>Parklive</i> sounds even better than the real thing. It's a transcendent and exuberant 25-song set, capturing the infectious energy of a 21-year-old live band still riding an impossibly prolonged peak-- Albarn has to make an age-appropriate revision to the lyrics of ""End of a Century"" (""The mind gets dirty/ As you get closer... to 50"")-- and a city still gleeful and staggering from that post-Olympic high. Following the recent release of the career-spanning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16877-blur-21/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blur 21</i> box set</a>, at a moment when the band's legacy is in the process of being revisited, argued, and revised, it's hard to imagine the serendipitously timed <i>Parklive</i> <i>not</i> ousting the competition-- namely 2009's <i>All the People</i> or the two live performances included on <i>Blur 21</i>-- to become Blur's definitive live release.</p>
<p>From the tone-setting and rowdy opener ""Girls &amp; Boys"" onward (the only hint that it's not actually the golden Brit Pop year of 1994 is the subtle, faintly poignant past-tense Albarn sneaks in: ""Love in the 90s <i>was</i> paranoid""), the set is heavy on the sort of pop anthems that fit the crowd's celebratory, post-Olympic mood. There are plenty of fittingly direct explicit addresses to their home city, from a rousing version of <i>Parklife</i>'s ""London Loves"" (""This song is called 'London Loves'. And WE LOVE LONDON!"") right through to a call and response chant of ""London!"" during the penultimate ""For Tomorrow"". Suffice to say that when Phil Daniels comes out to bark out his iconic lines in ""Parklife"", this is a crowd that remains in a sustained state of apeshitness for the whole three-and-a-half minutes.</p>
<p>Blur, of course, have a back catalog full of songs to fit all sorts of moods, but what makes <i>Parklive</i> a better listening experience than some of their other live recordings is how cohesive the entire set's energy feels. Much of the credit here should go to the formidable, too-often-unsung rhythm section that is Dave Rowntree and Alex James: They keep even the set's moodiest material here bobbing along with a brisk, agreeable gait. There are a few moments when it doesn't quite work (this comparatively buoyant live version of ""No Distance Left to Run"" doesn't hold a candle to the original), but overall the affect is positive: Check out the way the band teases out the latent pop sensibility of <i>13</i>'s atmospheric ""Trim Trabb"" and ""Caramel"", adding a new dimension to the songs.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest goosebump moments, though, come from the songs that fall somewhere between anthemic stadium pop and smudgy mood pieces. Even an insomniac's obsessive YouTube expedition to listen to every live version of ""Beetlebum"" ever (<i>trust</i> me) would probably not uncover a version showcasing a better vocal from Albarn, let alone an instrumental finale that rises to the occasion quite like Graham Coxon's squalling solo does here. Elsewhere, the brassy, pitch-perfect closer ""The Universal"" showers the crowd with generous handfuls of sonic confetti, and live favorite ""Tender"" is, as always, divine. Coxon's bluesy refrain, ""Oh my babyyyy,"" has become the ""Freebird!"" of Blur shows-- you can hear some strains of it travel, request-like, through the crowd while the band tunes up for another song earlier in the set. Backed by gospel singers, Albarn's vocal is powerful, but the audience feels like the frontpeople on this 9-plus-minute rendition as they steer the mantra-like refrain rippling through the park. Tens of thousands of voices strong, it's still got an intimacy about it, like the biggest, greatest campfire singalong ever.</p>
<p><i>Parklive</i> showcases Blur in top form, but live albums are about a little more than a band; they document a moment too. The band was smart to rush the digital release last week, while the world's still experiencing a post-Olympic hangover, and the performance captures the city that's always been their muse at its most jubilant. By the time <i>Parklive</i> sees a full DVD release in November, who knows if they'll have once again changed their tune about this performance being their last; personally (and especially since they're a band that's always thrived amidst a stormy internal dynamic) I believe them about as much as I believed that <i>The Black Album</i> was Jay-Z's retirement record. But in the off chance that this is the last we ever hear from Blur, it's hard to imagine a band going out with a more triumphant victory lap.</p></div>"|17068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17068-parklive/|8.5|Lindsay Zoladz

Founded in the suburbs outside of Los Angeles, the band, led by teenage brothers Jeff and Steve McDonald, wrote scrappy and bratty three-chord pop songs that betrayed a fascination with B-movie kitsch via references to Charles Manson, <i>The </i><i>Exorcist </i>actress Linda Blair, and sugar-infused breakfast cereals. According to legend, they even opened for Black Flag at a middle school graduation party.</p>
<p>But eventually, Redd Kross accrued some polish. By the early 90s, the band had evolved into a heavy but hooky power-pop outfit. After a few years spent wandering the globe supporting less-worthy, yet more successful, alternative era bands-- Spin Doctors and Stone Temple Pilots, among them-- Redd Kross decided to hang it up for a while, easing into an indefinite hiatus following the release of their 1997 album, <i>Show World</i>.</p>
<p>And now, they're back. <i>Researching the Blues</i>, the group's latest record, was written and recorded around 2007 after the band was coaxed out of retirement for a handful of festival dates, and is just now seeing release via Merge. The McDonald brothers pick up pretty much where they left off, smudging vintage Cheap Trick riffs with liberal amounts of overdrive and balancing lovelorn lyrics with imagery swiped from the ""cult"" aisle of your local video store. But in a lot of ways, they're better at it now. Produced by Steve, the younger brother, lately of OG hardcore revivalist outfit Off!, <i>Researching the Blues</i> is a leaner and more focused records than its two predecessors. With the murky production artifacts of the 90s stripped away-- the heavy reverb, the walls of fuzz, the chorus pedal-laden solos-- Redd Kross sound tighter and more energetic, even though their guitar tones have mellowed a little.</p>
<p>Over the last several decades, power-pop has proven to be a suitable vessel for all sorts of far-out content, from the surrealist ranting of Guided By Voices, to the teenage ennui of Shoes, to punk-informed self-examination of the Mice. But from a structural standpoint, you have to play by the rules. There has to be a verse, a chorus, and a jangling guitar hook. On <i>Researching the Blues</i>, Redd Kross prove they still have a knack for shifting those component parts into fresh shapes. In just three and a half minutes, ""Stay Away From Downtown"" ping-pongs between vocal hooks and sticky guitar leads. ""Dracula's Daughter"" cakes on the Byrds-style ""oohs"" and ""aahhs"" to dreamy effect. With its power chord-driven teaser chorus and miniature slide guitar break, ""Winter Blues"" is the kind of song Weezer fans would gladly trade all of the band's post-<i>Pinkerton</i> records to get. Sometimes it pays to take a break, even if it lasts a little more than decade.</p></div>"|16908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16908-researching-the-blues/|7.1|Aaron Leitko

The 10 songs on their lightly grooving, lightly melancholic debut, <i>Electric Hawaii</i>, are all pretty in almost the exact same way: pitched at the same breezy, cool, Xanax-blue mid-tempo shuffle, with lead singer Kody Nielson laying his creamy, sighing voice atop in precisely the same way. If the drummer has mastered another drumbeat other than the ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" one, he's not letting on. The jazz-flecked chord progressions that send the choruses tumbling through their dreamy motions give the album a faint shpritz of spy-movie cool. They stop to indulge exactly one instrumental freak out (on ""Cola Elixir""), and immediately afterward, they spit-smooth this stray lock back in place and carry on. It's an unsexy but rewarding approach: You might not need all 10 of these songs in a row, but any one, two, or three of them would make for pleasant company.</p>
<p>Nielson is the brother of Unknown Mortal Orchestra's Ruban Nielson, and you can imagine a family dinner table with some Felix-and-Oscar tension around it: Opossom are fussy where UMO are shaggy. If both bands seem stoner-friendly, UMO is a pipe clogged with resin and Opossom a carefully sterilized stainless-steel vaporizer. <i>Electric Hawaii</i> shines like a model kitchen's immaculate surfaces, which means that there is a whiff of Nowhere-ness to the band's sound: on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13751-blue-meanies/"" target=""_blank"">""Blue Meanies""</a>, Nielson sounds eerily like <i>Guero</i>-era Beck, while on ""Girl"" he sounds more like Panda Bear's brother than UMO's. Even when the sound palette shifts sneakily-- the cello that courses gracefully through the chorus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13338-getaway-tonight/"" target=""_blank"">""Getaway Tonight""</a>, for example, or the neatly orchestrated stop-and-start structure of ""Watchful Eye""-- it can be hard to notice. None of it does much to disturb the music's glossy yawn.</p>
<p>The vaguely Wes Anderson-styled video for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvmJZG2wYL0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fly""</a>-- quirky scientists, quirky experiment, quirky UFOs-- cements the overall impression left by <i>Electric Hawaii</i>, that you could have stumbled across Opossom on MTV in the late 90s or early 00s, when a band could still surface with a memorable, narrow sound, an eye-catching video, and have a hit or two. (My mental Rolodex slots them somewhere north of Rooney's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB809oiPE1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blue Side""</a> and somewhere slightly south of Space's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-wIvsZBFhQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Female of the Species""</a>.) To Opossom's credit, there are several potential versions of that hit here: ""Fly"", ""Blue Meanies"", and ""Outer Space"" all seem equally viable. There is a lot of craft to admire in the songwriting, and in the perfectly sepia-tinged production. But <i>Electric Hawaii</i> is an album that's easier to bop your head to while idly imagining the technology commercial it could soundtrack than it is to engage with.</p></div>"|17065.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17065-electric-hawaii/|6.1|Jayson Greene

The Pomona, Calif., doom-inflected hardcore quintet <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/30511-xibalba/"" target=""_blank"">Xibalba</a> seem to understand this, and when they keep things straightforward, they're very good at making youth-crew songs that stick (and make you want to do anything but sit still). Since signing to Southern Lord for their second record, the quintet's shed the ""metalcore"" tag you could've affixed to their 2011 debut <i>Madre Mia Por</i> Los Dias (now licensed by SL). But when <i>Hasta La Muerte</i> (""To the Death"") is most compelling, it doesn't get too fancy. For instance, the female vocals on ""Mala Mujer"", don't work.  But when they follow the conventions and motions of both hardcore and doom-- the other genre they do well-- the blend can be exhilarating</p>
<p>Take lead track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13753-sentenced/"" target=""_blank"">""Sentenced""</a>, a song that ups the sludge of their previous offerings, but maintains the mosh parts. (Like all good hardcore bands, they have a great drummer.) The album was recorded by Taylor Young of fellow SL-imprinted hardcore group Nails. He gets a deep, full sound on the excellent slow-release doom/sludge-core instrumental, ""The Flood"", and keeps that sort of deep density when the band goes all-systems-forward on anthems like ""Stoneheart"" and ""Laid to Rest"". Throughout, the heavy tone of the guitars mixes with the sucker punches of the hardcore-- it's a huge-sounding combo.</p>
<p>Adding to that swarm, Southern Lord head, Sunn O))) member, and ex-hardcore kid Greg Anderson contributes guitar to a couple songs: You'll know, for sure, he was in the room for the Sunn-on-Disembodied closer ""Cold"". He also appears on the previously mentioned standout ""The Flood"", and you'll at least feel his main band's spiritual presence on the 8-minute ""Lujuria"", which finds Xibalba stretching without trying to rewrite the book (though it does feature a mid-song breakdown that feels almost black metal in its ambiance and anguished screams). These moments point to a natural, not forced fusion, like what you'd find in vintage Morbid Angel, a deep, intense, sick atmosphere that's so overstuffed, it can't help but spill over into different areas. (Fittingly, Dan Seagrave, known best for his work on early 90s death metal albums by the likes of Morbid Angel, Entombed, Dismember, etc., did the cover art.)</p>
<p>Xibalba is the name of the Mayan underworld, which is why there are so many groups who use it as a moniker (check out <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/search?searchString=xibalba&amp;type=band_name"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Metal Archives</a>). In this case, it's a great description of the overall atmosphere. At <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/placeoffear"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MySpace</a>, the band lists its genres as ""death metal / hardcore / Latin."" They sing the title track in Spanish and you get Latin-feeling group hand percussion in ""Flood"".

<p class=""MsoNormal"">To begin understanding Shintaro Sakamoto, it helps to start with Todd Rundgren. Like Rundgren, Sakamoto started his career with a psych-pop garage band before decamping into the studio and striving toward making the Platonic ideal of pop music by himself. The trajectory is the same, though while Rundgren only lasted about 2 years with the Nazz before releasing a string of idiosyncratic hermit-pop LPs through the 1970s, Sakamoto led the great <a href=""http://www.yurayurateikoku.com/index2.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yura Yura Teikoku</a> (Japanese for ""The Wobbling Empire"") from 1989 through 2010 before releasing his solo debut this year. Like so many Japanese acts of the past few decades, Yura was huge in its home country, but only registered a cult-act blip stateside (though DFA <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Yura-Yura-Teikoku-Hollow-Me-Beautiful/release/2040486"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">quietly re-issued</a> an LP on its Death from Abroad imprint in 2009). The impeccably produced lounge-pop of <i>How to Live With a Phantom</i> seems destined for a small-but-ardent listenership.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sakamoto produced and played many of the instruments on <i>Phantom</i>, conjuring the image of Rundgren-as-golden god secluded in his hotel room of the<a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BRl2dqqWrhU/TzHq2umDSEI/AAAAAAAABRU/BRrzzdNpNoo/s1600/s%26a.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <i>Something/Anything</i> gatefold</a> photo. But while it's easy to imagine Sakamoto laying down conga tracks while adjusting board levels with his big toe, <i>Phantom</i>'s vibe more closely evokes the anonymous band downstairs in the hotel lounge, playing for weary business travelers and soundtracking the early moments of an ill-fated hookup. He sounds less like a passionate frontman, in other words, and more like some sort of Japanese Bryan Ferry, with songs suggesting the pop formalism of Rundgren and Steely Dan--and occasionally Juan Garcia Esquivel's Space-Age Bachelor Pad--sung in Japanese, with a glassy, purposeful distance between musician and listener.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Dig deeper, though, and you start to hear the echoes of past pop moments when localized groups of musicians started incorporating influences on a global scale: the late 1960s Tropicalia moment in Brazil, and especially the mid-1990s Shibuya-Kei movement in Sakamoto's hometown of Tokyo. This is the quiet genius of <i>Phantom</i>: it incorporates so much, yet remains as willfully aloof as the mannequin Sakamoto poses with on the cover (or, if you like, <a href=""http://blog.wfmu.org/.a/6a00d83451c29169e201538e29df96970b-pi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his pose</a> in the center of this older Yura Yura promo photo).</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Aloof, sure, but far from sanitized. Granted, many readers likely see this distinction as a choice between Plain and Diet Plain, but if you've come this far, you know it amounts to much more than the narcisissm of minor differences. <i>Phantom</i> not only feels self-aware, but for something that sounds like it was it was recorded in the ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pERrVMbsCfg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rockit</a>"" house, it's got a sense of humor as well.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Me, I was hooked when the ""Shakedown Street"" guitar showed up in ""Mask on Mask,"" and my affection was only further solidified via that song's conga run, Sakamoto's lovely melodic bass leads, and-- wait for it-- his squealing sax solo. About the time of the <i>second</i> flute break in ""Dancing With Pain"", or maybe when the aquarium air pump sound effect kicked in during ""A Stick and Slacks"", or perhaps it my fifth run through the opening track's Getz/Gilberto nod, it became clear that the album's purposeful artificiality is much more in line with Beck than say, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258153/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">S1m0ne</a>. Maybe this is Shintaro's way of honing a new skill: playing with phantoms without tipping over into the uncanny valley.</p>

As part of the simple, self-explanatory ""Black Cab Sessions"" web series, the 27-year-old British singer recently took her place in the middle seat and proceeded to offer a nuanced live take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13769-wildest-moments/"" target=""_blank"">""Wildest Moments""</a>, a slyly epic ballad from her debut album, <i>Devotion</i>. In such tight quarters, she's not quite sure where to look-- at her bandmates, outside to the street, or directly into the camera-- her head on a controlled swivel. She's capable of blasting the back window out with her voice, which consistently strikes blue notes somewhere between Sade and Whitney, but she holds back, well-aware of her unplugged environment. The performance is seriously moving, and yet Ware lets loose a few brief grins and a slight laugh, as if to say, ""All this is quite ridiculous, don't you think?"" And that's Jessie Ware: a devout realist making the most of her pop-star dreams-- and her commitment to both sides of that equation turns <i>Devotion</i> into a uniquely soulful masterclass.</p>
<p>If you've half-slept through just one episode of a reality-television singing competition over the last decade, you're probably somewhat privy to Ware's trajectory. The one-time theater kid started out as a backup singer before nearly giving up her musical aspirations to be a journalist. But then, thanks to a montage-ready twist of fate, she ended up singing lead on melodic bass producer SBTRKT's 2010 single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je6_VPA6X-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nervous""</a>, which led to a solo label deal, which led to Ware being forced to take the spotlight. But oftentimes backup singers are off to the side for a reason, and the hard truth is that's where they will be most productive; there are only so many lead roles in the world of pop. Considering her self-described ""boringly sensible"" outlook and the doubt pinging around her brain (""I had to get past the idea of, like, 'Who gives a shit about what I'm gonna fucking write a song about?'""), Ware sounds more like a supporting player on paper. But then you hear her voice, and any and all limits start to fade into the distance.</p>
<p>Singing over futuristic electronic tracks like ""Nervous"" and dubstep producer Joker's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12578-the-vision-let-me-breathe-ft-jessie-ware-and-freddie-gibbs/"" target=""_blank"">""The Vision""</a>, Ware sounded strong, but also somewhat overshadowed by the showy bleeps scurrying around her. <i>Devotion</i>, however, marries her natural gift with throbbing instrumentation that breathes life into every single turn of phrase or sensitive vocal embellishment. The tempos bounce lightly, the drama escalates, the synth-laden ambience cascades like so many postcard waterfalls. This is smoldering music, its smoke bewitching enough to make the original fire more or less irrelevant. </p>
<p>The record was largely produced by three men-- Dave Okumu of UK art rockers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27748-the-invisible/"" target=""_blank"">the Invisible</a>, Bristol electronic upstart <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29346-julio-bashmore/"" target=""_blank"">Julio Bashmore</a>, and singer-songwriter Kid Harpoon, who co-wrote songs on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16004-ceremonials/"" target=""_blank"">Florence and the Machine's <i>Ceremonials</i></a>-- each leaving his distinct mark without distracting from the whole. Okumu's tracks, especially opener ""Devotion"", are dark and dense, hinting at passion's underbelly with each deep bass hit; Bashmore's are more airy and upbeat, primed for classy dancefloors worldwide; Kid Harpoon offers the most festival-ready songs-- big hooks, bigger drums-- like ""Wildest Moments"". Tying the disparate sounds together are Okumu, who co-produced and played many instruments on nearly every track, and of course Ware herself, who co-wrote all but one song. Her voice is a marvel throughout, often gaining power by holding back or briefly teasing its scope while staying faithful to melody over melisma. Her words are in tune with this refinement as they chronicle the in-betweenness of love, dismissing easy pleasures for feelings that are more hard-won, confusing, and frightening. </p>
<p>Take the most classically ""pop"" song here: the weightless <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14027-sweet-talk/"" target=""_blank"">""Sweet Talk""</a>, which modernizes Whitney Houston's late-80s effervescence à la Beyoncé's <a href=""http://youtu.be/Ob7vObnFUJc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love on Top""</a>. On its face, the track is all endless dimples and mesmerizing lips, but then the verses sink in: ""Don't keep me with the kisses, there's never any there when I need,"" pleads Ware. She knows she's going to fall for the smooth nothings once again, though, and lets the keys try to cover the inevitable regret, which plays out on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1837-running/"" target=""_blank"">""Running""</a>, where Ware starts, ""Your words alone could drive me to a thousand tears."" The title track, with its foreboding murk, gives whiffs of a seance as Ware asks, ""Ready to love but do you want it enough?/ Can we find a way to bring it back again?"" Given the track's perfectly rendered storm clouds, you get the impression she already knows the answers. The idea of running comes up often on <i>Devotion</i>, and it's clear that Ware isn't interested in the sprints-- when it comes to love, she's angling for a marathon. And she knows marathons can be really fucking tough. </p>
<p>Talking about her childhood aspirations earlier this year, Ware told me, ""It's so unattainable to be a singer. I'd watch 'Top of the Pops' and think I could never do that. And I didn't look like a pop star compared to the people I used to watch on MTV like J.Lo or Destiny's Child."" As a middle-class Jewish girl from South London who's closer to 30 than 20, she's still nothing close to a cookie-cutter R&amp;B breakout. Her success thus far-- and its likely continuation thanks to <i>Devotion</i>-- is a testament to both her talent and budding songwriting skills, as well as the wide-open field that is modern R&amp;B, where a sensitive soul like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a> can make a star-in-a-box like Chris Brown look about as relevant as a dial-up modem. ""I'm just having fun and trying to pretend I'm a pop star,"" said Ware, talking about her high-style videos. And while embellishment and theatricality is still a coveted and worthwhile pursuit within the pop realm, the beautiful thing is that, in 2012, Jessie Ware doesn't need to pretend more than anyone else.</p></div>"|16938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16938-devotion/|8.5|Ryan Dombal

Mostly because the truth wins out: ""The Story of <i>Going Blank Again</i>"" contains the following quotes from the members of Ride: ""It's a steady work process, which is a great way to do an album,"" ""It was fun, it was a team effort,"" ""I think it was the closest together as a band we ever were. There was no tension, no conflict. Everything just seemed to work.""</p>
<p>Ride didn't bankrupt Creation Records; in fact, they partied with Alan McGee. They never advanced the image of being hermetic visionaries; they had to force themselves to stop socializing with other bands. They never disappeared for years on end and would later release some universally reviled trad-rock albums that doubled as applications to open for Oasis, or in the case of Andy Bell, to <i>be </i>in Oasis. But on <i>Going Blank Again</i>, Ride managed one thing MBV never accomplished after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991/"" target=""_blank""><i>Loveless</i></a> and probably never will: facing the crippling expectations and making a tremendous follow-up record.</p>
<p>It might not change the narrative surrounding Ride, but hopefully it does raise the question of why <i>Going Blank Again </i>is assumed to be the contrarian's choice for the band's true masterpiece. Some of it is pretty understandable: <i>Going Blank Again </i>is a noticeably lighter affair and lacks the monolithic heft of its predecessor, which is readily apparent from their respective album art. I mean, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15069-nowhere-20th-anniversary-edition/"" target=""_blank"">compare the two covers</a>, which one looks like the classic to <i>you</i>?  Perhaps more crucially, <i>Going Blank Again </i>was without a movement, the UK looking to move past shoegaze towards something more personality-driven, though it wasn't clear quite what yet.</p>
<p>Strange thing is, Ride could be included in that. Many lesser bands followed in Ride's wake, and ""Leave Them All Behind"" is as close as a mission statement that you're gonna get from a band whose lyrics are mostly nonsense. Bell and Mark Gardener's guitars somehow got even louder and it can initially register as <i>Nowhere Plus</i>, but it also sets the tone in how <i>Going Blank Again </i>would distinguish itself. ""Seagull"" started <i>Nowhere </i>with a peal of feedback and six minutes of trebly squall that only revealed its layers when played at tinnitus-inducing levels. Blessed with Alan Moulder's crystalline production, the salutation of ""Leave Them All Behind"" is a reverberating Hammond organ and an extremely punchy drum break from Loz Colbert, which acknowledge the two encroaching threads of influence of the band: the first of the Who, reflecting Ride's increasing stadium-readiness, the latter acknowledging the influx of hip-hop and funk breakbeats into UK rock.</p>
<p>It might be meant as the valedictory speech of shoegaze, but it isn't actually shoegaze at all, not in the sense where the genre's main goal was to obliterate or obscure. Every single element of ""Leave Them All Behind"" is voluminous, but not just in sheer <i>loudness</i>: It's overwhelming, not oppressive, and the sonic expanse is even more mindblowing with this remastering job. Bell and Gardener's barnstorming guitars, Steve Queralt's girder-thick bassline, and Colbert's Moon-sized drum fills all could fill canyons individually, yet never once does it sound like something other than four guys in a room, which explains why Ride was pretty much the only band of their ilk that was as good live as they were on record. That said, the inclusion of the <i>Live at Brixton</i> DVD is mostly notable for its stupendously dated visuals.</p>
<p>The band adamantly demanded ""Leave It All Behind"" be the lead single, and it reached No. 9 in Britain, their first Top 10 hit. This would seemingly bode well for <i>Going Blank Again</i>'s fortunes considering the next single was the giddy, nonsensical ""Twisterella"". Drawing from the same sugar-spun power-pop of labelmates Teenage Fanclub as well as the cuts from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13449-the-stone-roses/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Stone Roses</i></a> equally influenced by acid and ecstasy, it was rightfully described by the band as their ""ace card."" Yet it was a baffling flop on the charts and Ride released no more singles from there on out. </p>
<p>Shame, too, as <i>Going Blank Again </i>should have been able to take advantage of its depth and diversity, its main trump over <i>Nowhere</i>. You get Television-styled guitar interplay and Bell and Gardener's most tossed-off lyrics on ""Not Fazed"". ""Chrome Waves"" shot for ""Unfinished Sympathy"", but landed somewhere closer to Seal's ""Crazy"" and was all the better for it. ""Leave Them All Behind"" has an equally colossal bookend in ""OX4"", though the addition of four bonus tracks from the <i>Leave Them All Behind </i>and <i>Twisterella </i>EPs are hardly an unwelcome appendage (particularly ""Grasshopper""). And there are the goofy pop songs like ""Twisterella"" which arguably worked against <i>Going Blank Again</i>'s legacy, and even the band will admit the flower-child spoof of ""Making Judy Smile"" isn't its best work.</p>
<p>Because the typical selling point of shoegaze-- there's classic pop under all that noise!-- doesn't quite explain what Ride excelled at. Speaking on the origin of ""Mouse Trap"", Bell observed, ""occasionally you discover a chord sequence that you'd be quite happy to play for two hours non-stop."" There's about eight or so of those on <i>Going Blank Again</i>. Even with Ride's aim to integrate more true pop songwriting, much of <i>Going Blank Again </i>wisely follows the wake of the immortal ""Vapour Trail"", which rode out a single gorgeous progression for nearly its entirety, its only flaw stopping at four minutes instead of eight. More and more, I think the true impact of hip-hop on Ride wasn't evident in Colbert's drum fills so much as their seeing chord progressions as rhythmic beds as much as melodic ones, the way a rapper might treat a breakbeat. As such, Ride proved to be a band that operated in largesse more than finesse: simply building on these perfect chord changes for five minutes at a time with stretched out vocal harmonies, a brief shift of a couple of bars into a minor key, erratic tempo changes toward the thrilling end of ""Cool Your Boots"", bent soloing on ""Leave Them All Behind"", a 12-string riff breaking up the middle of ""Mouse Trap"". The pleasures of <i>Going Blank Again </i>are cumulative, and if you simply love the sound of guitars-- clean ones, distorted ones, overdriven Leslie amps, Les Pauls, Rickenbackers, whatever-- this is about as indulgent as it gets.</p>
<p>Perhaps the timing is just convenient, but <i>Going Blank Again </i>feels more similar to the recently reissued version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16862-sugar-reissues/"" target=""_blank"">Sugar's <i>Copper Blue </i></a>than anything that's strictly identifiable as shoegaze.  It's certainly reckoning with the aftermath of <i>Loveless </i>and an awareness of <i>Nevermind</i>, if not necessarily its influence. But they're both records that feel welcome 20 years later, because while their more famed peers have influenced hundreds of pale imitators, these more approachable records feel strangely undervalued. Because really, what was the last new band to bear the influence of Sugar or Ride? Not even in strict sonic similarity, since it's hard to imagine the brassy acoustic guitars you hear on ""Chrome Waves"" ever coming back into vogue. But more in how there's an unfortunate void of very loud, very catchy, and very polished guitar bands that aren't ashamed of commercial ambitions.  You can learn a lot from <i>Going Blank Again</i>: Come up with four chords worth repeating for four minutes, hum a pretty melody, overdub the guitars, overdub them again, and make the drums even louder. It's not the stuff of legends, but we need great records, too.  </p></div>"|17072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17072-going-blank-again/|8.7|Ian Cohen

The problem was partly the sheer number of wacky curveballs, but more crucially, the collective's self-expansive sonic approach was too frequently reined in to allow the indifferent songs to speak, when any listener could have told the group that they were arrangers first and songwriters second. Arriving less than a year later, this follow-up assemblage of new tracks, collaborations, and remixes for other artists<i> </i>can't help seeming corrective, though when what requires correcting is so obvious that just seems like pragmatic good sense. Of course, like any hasty reversal, this opens up its own succession of problems, though perhaps less in the sense of flaws or shortcomings than issues that Mungolian Jet Set still need to work out, a feeling of incompletion to the story at odds with the group's unmistakable production style and the music's readily apparent surface pleasures.</p>
<p>The shift is apparent from <i>Mungodelics</i>' first track, a remix of Jaga Jazzist's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13790-toccata/"" target=""_blank"">""Toccata""</a>. Built around iridescent, shimmering chime loops, and featuring a starry-eyed, bittersweet central melody reminiscent of Superpitcher, the widescreen instrumental is at once gargantuan in scope and unusually focused, irresistibly sentimental yet utterly serious. As with recent releases from fellow Norwegian Todd Terje, ""Toccata"" suggests a fascination with the vaguely new age proto-techno of Steve Reich's <i>Music for 18 Musicians </i>and perhaps Manuel Göttsching's <i>E2-E4</i>. It also suggests that Mungolian Jet Set have rediscovered that their maximalist aesthetic is best deployed in the service of depth rather than (or as well as) breadth: While the arrangement may be spare in conception, its shifting layers and vaguely ominous echoing glimmers resemble a magic eye picture, the smallest shifts in emphasis revealing fascinating new vistas. </p>
<p>The balance of <i>Mungodelics </i>continues to distance itself from last year's album. At a stretch, ""People on Strong Stuff""-- with its unnecessary guitar solo and declamatory, occasionally tuneless vocal somewhere between Jim Kerr and Dave Gahan-- could be a <i>Schlungs</i> outtake, but the groove is sturdier, <i>trackier</i>, a constantly uncoiling web of multi-tiered, syncopated rhythms. Throughout, what largely replaces zaniness is an obsession with build that recalls erstwhile progressive house hero Sasha, and even a restrained tune like the group's remix of Unni Wilhelmsen's ""Revolving Door""-- dreamy disco-house redolent of the Meanderthals-- cannot help but spiral upward on ever-unfolding swirls of keyboards and percussion, a rising but never-quite-cresting wave of blissed out introspection.</p>
<p>This relative lack of climaxes is startling when compared to the group's past work, giving <i>Mungodelics </i>the feel of deep, shadowy valleys of arrangement finesse, nestled between three brief, glorious peaks. After ""Toccata"", the next highpoint is ""Smells Like Gasoline"", a Moroder-esque tech-house tune of metallic synth chords and scintillating echoes that, after four minutes of teasing build, unleashes a house piano vamp of almost melancholy perfection, only to almost immediately subside into eerie dub-techno percolations that unexpectedly revive the early work of German minimal duo MRI, but with added rippling wind chimes. This kind of left-turn does not so much reward as <i>require</i> headphone listening, where you're close enough to the beats that both extraversion and involution register as an enveloping wall of sound. Other settings I've tested, from the car to the living room, allow this music to slip too comfortably into the background for long stretches (something you could never have accused <i>Schlungs</i> of doing, for better or worse), but whereas the nine minutes of ""Mung's Picazzo"" can sound overstretched and aimless in such environments, a ""close reading"" can seem almost gripping, the tune's meandering groove taking on the portentous air of a thundercloud always on the verge of bursting.</p>
<p>Fittingly, with its closer ""The Dark Incal"" <i>Mungodelics</i> ascends a third pinnacle that inverts entirely the appeals of its opener, offering up maximalist and shamelessly emotive tribal trance-house reminiscent of Booka Shade's ""Mandarine Girl"" in both sound and scope, a preposterously grand gesture built out of meticulous details worthy of the North Korean Mass Games. All that is loveable or lamentable in Mungolian Jet Set's music is right here. It's overblown melodrama, and you can see through it if you want to. But why would you want to?</p></div>"|16942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16942-mungodelics/|7.1|Tim Finney

Across the label's intoxicating early run-- covering everything from Burmese skronk to Laotian folk to North Korean prop-opera-- it revealed a modern world (of) music that was as intense and surreal as anything imaginable in the Western music canon. The label even brought audiences vital modern acts like Tuareg guitarist Bombino and the astounding family band Group Doueh, not to mention the brusque, poker-faced Syrian pop vocalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27844-omar-souleyman/"" target=""_blank"">Omar Souleyman</a> via tours of Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Late last year, fellow Sublime Frequencies conniver Mark Gergis started up yet another imprint called <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sham-Palace/108672552579925"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sham Palace</a>. The label's first order of business was to reissue a rare 60-minute cassette from Souleyman onto vinyl. With five Souleyman titles now available in American shops, this would appear at first to be an example of flooding the marketplace. Only, the double LP featured a king cobra of a track in the 30-minute version of ""Leh Jani"" (a truncated version of which appeared on SF's <i>Highway to Hassake</i> album). For those who had thought that the Sublime Frequencies catalog already exposed the rawest of sounds to be found in such far-flung locales, the Sham Palace record suggested that they could in fact always get deeper and harder.</p>
<p>So it follows with this compilation of 1990s-2000s dabke music, a staple of wedding ceremonies, and judging by the sounds of this compilation, the aural equivalent of vodka-Red Bulls: jittery and buzzing Bacchanalian dance grooves that are slightly metallic in tone. And while Souleyman hails from the northeastern part of Syria (his dabke featuring the bouzouk), this compilation culls its sounds from tapes released in the southern region Houran, ranging from Damascus in Syria into Jordan and west toward the Golan Heights. It's here that Gergis traveled about, recording live from the mixing desk at such raucous wedding parties in the region. And once again, the Sublime Frequencies folks explore the music of a region that doubles as a Western media hot topic, gratefully offering neither context nor analysis. Instead, we have only the music.</p>
<p>The notes state that this region of Syria jumbles together Syrians, Bedouin, Palestinians, Jordanians, and more, yet however acute the ear for noting regional differences might be, they are soon overwhelmed by the drone of the mijwiz that snakes through all seven of the songs. A double bamboo reed that's shrill, adenoidal, jolting, fly-buzzing, and ensorcelling with every swing of circular breath, the mijwiz is foregrounded in such wedding songs.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the sound was balanced between the reed, handdrums and vocal chants. But when the drums went electronic in the early 90s (read: hip-hop), the mijwiz-- much like the guitarist and lead vocalist scrambled to do amid jazz's big bands-- also went electric so as to remain out front. And now modern dabke interweaves sampled and mic'd mijwiz melodies, making for tightly interwoven melodic lines from the doubled mijwiz and synth. So the tone on Faraj Kadah/Ashraf Abu Leil's seven-minute dabke ranges from finely minced beeps to breathlessness to a tone not unlike the bleat of a sore-throated calf. Ahmad Al Kosem's fierce songs have their titles translate as ""Love Is No Joke"" and ""I Will Grieve Until I See Her Again"", fine wedding themes both. And amid an album full of tough and coarse male vocal plaints, my favorite remains the utterly bizarre chipmunk voices that crash the wedding of Mohamed Al Ali's contribution.</p>
<p>Again, the Sublime Frequencies family presents a snapshot of a region only just reaching our ears via the Western news media and tales of international crisis (see their compilations of Iraqi and North Korean music, for example). It's a complicated situation, one not easily gleaned from reading the <i>Times</i> or Al Jazeera, and rather than comment, Gergis and crew offer us a brief yet very human glimpse into a people all too often abstracted by the 24-hour news cycle.</p></div>"|16998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16998-sounds-of-the-syrian-houran/|7.4|Andy Beta

White</a> was among those who got lost in those worlds, rubbing shoulders with the funny and fucked-up characters that Newman created out of a singular mix of spite and empathy. White became so obsessed with Newman that he eventually tracked down the 60-something singer-songwriter at his Los Angeles home, and handed him his own CDs. It was, in a way, a passing-of-the-torch in reverse. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In White's mind, his debut album, <i>Big Inner</i>, might very well be an attempt to re-create Newman's 1974 concept album about southern otherness, <i>Good Old Boys. Inner </i>is certainly southern, it's definitely other, and the songs collectively tell the kind of story that always appealed to Newman, about painfully human creatures yearning for spiritual transcendence and finding that their own flawed, flesh-and-blood selves always seem to get in the way. But where Newman was among the most literary of the late-60s/early-70s post-Dylan generation of singer-songwriters, White's primary mode of expression on <i>Inner </i>is musical. With his background in jazz arranging and natural grasp of American roots music, the native Virginian has positioned himself at the head of a corps of young and veteran musicians-- including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>'s Reggie Pace, Phil Cook of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/"" target=""_blank"">Megafaun</a>, and David Hood-- determined to revive long-lost record-making traditions in the service of re-imagining psychedelic music as gospel hymns.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Big Inner </i>is the first product of Spacebomb, a production entity and record label with a house band composed of White, bassist Cameron Ralston, and drummer Pinson Chanselle at its core. (There is also a sizeable horn and string section, and a choir.) The idea is to bring artists to White's Richmond, Virginia, headquarters-- essentially the attic of a house on the west side of town-- and arrange their songs in the mold of velvety 70s soul, laidback New Orleans funk, and cosmic country-rock, with a special emphasis on vintage-sounding instrumentation and sweaty intimacy. </p>
<p class=""p1"">White introduces Spacebomb as a fully realized aesthetic right away on <i>Inner</i>'s opening track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13721-one-of-these-days/"" target=""_blank"">""One of These Days""</a>, which has the pulse of Willie Mitchell's productions for Al Green's magical run of early-70s LPs. White and his band play softly but not without purpose; their grip on the central groove remains steadfast even as a procession of ghostly funeral horns enter the picture to send the song in a pleasantly disorienting direction. </p>
<p class=""p1"">He revisits this subtle uneasiness between beauty and chaos throughout <i>Big Inner</i>, as the songs lyrically explore the ecstasy and agony of religion, and how it can explain away the mysteries of the universe, but never permanently. The stately gospel number ""Gone Away"" is mired in death, with the lord's mysterious ways offering little in the way of consolation. White sings in a pained murmur about how ""we cling to the cross with tremblin' and fear,"" because we know the end will inevitably come. If ""Gone Away"" pulls you into the darkness, the sinewy bass line in ""Big Love"" implores you to dance away the knowledge of impending mortality. ""Let's begin to spiral,"" White says, and-- as gospel music is intended to do-- he makes that universal ""sinking into the unknown"" feeling seem uplifting.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Randy Newman's gift was making his snapshots of racist rednecks and drunken asshole romantics seem like actual people, rather than the creations of a wise-ass Angeleno preoccupied by southern culture on the skids. White's gift on <i>Big Inner </i>is taking sounds created by actual southerners and turning them into figments of his musical imagination, which he bends and shapes into bottomless columns of ethereal soul. The final song on <i>Big Inner</i>,<i> </i>the nearly 10-minute ""Brazos"", wraps with White and his choir repeating a mantra about how Jesus is our friend and can deliver us from ""life's crushing blow."" Whether that's truth or fiction is irrelevant; in the magical moments that White creates, it's the wonderment that matters.</p></div>"|16963.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16963-big-inner/|8.1|Steven Hyden

It’s invited opinions-- loud ones-- from supporters and detractors alike.  Since their tracks are based on similar qualities-- spirited, can-do lyrics, sweeping harmonies, and deliriously stacked arrangements-- there's been almost no middle ground separating their excellent run of singles (""2080"", ""Tightrope"", ""Madder Red"", ""O.N.E."") from their catastrophic face-plants (""Mondegreen"", ""Rome""). Now that's changed. Yeasayer's third album, <i>Fragrant World</i>, is their first and only consistent LP. It not only proves that Yeasayer can make an unremarkable song, but that they can make 11 of them in a row.</p>
<p><i>Fragrant World </i>marks another transition for a band whose sound appears to be in constant flux, and initially, it can make you miss the ""old"" Yeasayer. There's a significant change here. While <i>All<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10805-all-hour-cymbals/"" target=""_blank""> Hour Cymbals </a></i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13922-odd-blood/"" target=""_blank""><i>Odd Blood </i></a>sounded nothing like <i>each other</i>, they reflected Yeasayer's surroundings at the time, the maximalist grab-from-anywhere approach that defined ambitious East Coast indie rock. They were in the lineage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a> when those bands they were still psychedelic and tribal, and they brought to mind the track-stuffing, techno-hippie approach of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"" target=""_blank"">Gang Gang Dance</a> in a pop mood. <i>Fragrant World</i>, on the other hand, is a decidedly minimalist affair. Its album cover might suggest otherwise, but Yeasayer have not gone dubstep or witch house, although the occasional undulating bass wobble and ticking hi-hat suggest they're going for something a little more trunk-rattling this time around. On the whole, the stylistic range is far narrower, and the geographic one much wider, as <i>Fragrant World </i>sounds like it's trying to jockey alongside miniaturists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Purity Ring</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a>-- acts that make music that sounds simultaneously tiny and fragile enough for iPod shuffles and scalable to subwoofers.</p>
<p>None of which plays to Yeasayer's strengths. The leaner sound puts the focus squarely on their lyrics, and their overall disposition hasn't changed along with their sonics; <i>Fragrant World </i>can feel painfully self-aware. A typically curious juxtaposition occurs over the  phased chords of ""Blue Paper"", when Anand Wilder sighs, ""She used to walk on concrete/ Now the sidewalk isn't green enough for her/ Says she misses Mother Earth."" Later on the squelching ""Devil and the Deed"", he mocks, ""You could never handle if she was into magic/ You could never stand it/ She couldn't speak your language."" The robotic bump 'n' grind of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13792-longevity/"" target=""_blank"">""Longevity""</a> is a new look for Yeasayer, but the only real friction is that of a square peg plugging into a round hole: ""My girl says that all the rain promises is to give life to the seeds/ Live in the moment/ Never count on longevity,"" sings Chris Keating. It's the sort of thing people say with alarming frequency in Yeasayer songs and absolutely nowhere else.</p>
<p>Songs here often take an advisory tone, and the lack of grounding becomes more pronounced whenever Yeasayer get topical. The overkill of EQ filters makes it nearly impossible to identify the folk hero or the shtick on ""Folk Hero Shtick"", with ""The emperor's standing naked/ How much longer can he fake it?"" failing to serve as any sort of guidance. Likewise, witness ""Reagan's Skeleton"" imagining right-wing oppression as a ""Thriller""-like<b> </b>phantasmagoria.</p>
<p>Then again, did the lyrics of ""2080"" or ""Ambling Alp"" get in the way? With those songs, Yeasayer managed to overwhelm the listener with an undeniable melody and sheer psychedelic swooning. Though their previously hyper-colored records were also self-produced, <i>Fragrant World </i>is curiously thin. It goes beyond the arrangements. While the hooks of ""No Bones"" and ""Devil and the Deed"" slowly grow on you, each hits a point around the three-minute mark where you might expect a pivot, a bridge, or some new texture. Instead, they just end meekly. This quality is most noticeable on lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13625-henrietta/"" target=""_blank"">""Henrietta""</a>, which works a melodic bassline, and the sort of elastic groove that powered <i>Odd Blood</i>'s best tracks.<span> </span>Yet after only two minutes, it cuts out and spends more than half of its time playing catch up with the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28027-neon-indian/"" target=""_blank"">Neon Indian</a> album.</p>
<p>Credit where it's due-- Yeasayer are ambitious enough to do something other than write ""2080"" sequels, even though they have every incentive to do just that. But unlike the erratic, occasionally captivating, and always bold <i>Odd Blood,</i> <i>Fragrant World </i>rests in a tentative middle ground. </p></div>"|16940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16940-fragrant-world/|5.4|Ian Cohen

<p>A mega-selling sensation back home in UK, the Darkness' 2003 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2524-permission-to-land/"" target=""_blank""><i>Permission to Land</i></a> was a more modest phenomenon in America, cracking the Billboard Top 40 and selling 500,000-plus copies. And even if their ingeniously titled 2005 follow-up, <i>One Way Ticket to Hell… And Back</i>, failed to make as great an impact on either side of the pond-- leading in part to an unceremonious breakup and, more lamentably, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOLthJnrdEY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hot Leg</a>-- the Darkness were very much a harbinger of how rock'n'roll would be recycled/revived in pop culture through the decade: <i>Guitar Hero</i>, <i>Rock of Ages</i>, Tony Soprano <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqpDxCo2vic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">enjoying possibly his last meal</a> to the sound of ""Don't Stop Believin'"". </p>
<p>So when Samsung needed a dormant early-2000s rock band to star in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjK_mKfosvw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their Galaxy Note Super Bowl ad</a> last February, they sure as hell didn't go for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4484-the-vines/"" target=""_blank"">the Vines</a>. Coming in the wake of a 2011 UK reunion tour, that commercial-- featuring newly moustached but ever-bare-chested lead shrieker Justin Hawkins-- served as a suitably shameless American reintroduction to a proudly shameless band, and a good chunk of the viewing audience could be forgiven for thinking the ad was another example of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_ngpyRuFg8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a one-hit wonder shilling their old song to pay new bills</a>. But despite exploiting all means necessary to stage their comeback, the Darkness are actually more interested in selling records than tablets: <i>Hot Cakes</i> marks the return of the original lineup that recorded <i>Permission</i> (including fu-manchu'ed bassist Frankie Poullain, who checked out shortly before <i>One Way Ticket</i>), with no less a pomp-rock master than <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ezrin#List_of_music_produced_by_Ezrin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bob Ezrin</a> behind the mixing board.</p>
<p>Justin Hawkins may be the face and attention-seizing voice of the Darkness, but the heart of their sound lies in his guitar playing, which offsets brother Dan's Angus Youngian raunch with the sort of rich, harmonic solos that Tom Scholz used to slather on Boston records. And despite the band's love of heavy metal histrionics, <i>Hot Cakes</i> furthers the notion that the Darkness are, in essence, a very slick power-pop band, one that's as beholden to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGRrOEbY3pI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Peace of Mind""</a> as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_of_Mind"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Piece of Mind</i></a>. But even with its generous supply of candy-coated riffs and easy-flowing melodies, <i>Hot Cakes</i> still goes down like lukewarm Eggo waffles: comfort-food familiar, but sapped of the frisson that made the Darkness special.</p>
<p>What always kept the Darkness from degenerating into Steel Panther-grade Sunset Strip parody was Justin Hawkins' flair for emasculating his band's crotch-rock thrust with self-effacing absurdity-- like the way <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-MtY1nRcpU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Growing on Me""</a> worked as a soundtrack to both blossoming romance and STD diagnosis, or how his courtship strategy on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDETEPYS3Hs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Friday Night""</a> involved making a date for badminton. Notwithstanding Hawkins' ear-piercing exhortation to ""suck my cock"" on the origin-myth intro ""Every Inch of You"", <i>Hot Cakes</i> mostly swaps out the singer's singular musings for pat, broad-stroked sentiments about not stopping (""Nothin's Gonna Stop Us""), hanging on (""Keep Me Hangin' On""), and everybody having a good time (""Everybody Have a Good Time""). The band's upcoming European tour with Lady Gaga thus makes perfect sense-- not just because both value <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12927-queen/"" target=""_blank"">Queen</a>-scaled spectacle, but because they both also deal in the same sort of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV1FrqwZyKw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-esteem-building fortune-cookie philosophy</a>.</p>
<p>Ironically, the one time the Darkness truly assert their peculiar personality on <i>Hot Cakes</i> is when they cover another band's song-- and not just any song, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>'s ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"", that crucial, transitory track serving as the gateway from the futurist Britpop of <i>The Bends</i> into the band's first dystopian masterpiece, <i>OK Computer</i>. The Darkness, however, simply hear it as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97IcMvkyw-Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the greatest song Iron Maiden never wrote</a>, translating the original's dreamy intensity into a battlefield-conquering rallying cry, powered by a steel-grinding locomotive chug and Hawkins' stratospheric cry of the chorus (not to mention a clever quote of Radiohead's ""Just"" for good measure). But beyond merely subjecting this sacred cow to a good rogering, the 80s-metal makeover brilliantly blurs the line critics like to draw between Serious, Respectable Rock Bands and Silly, Ridiculous Rock Bands. The Darkness may not care to join the ranks of the former, but it takes a considerable amount of craft and artistry to reduce Radiohead to the latter.</p></div>"|16937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16937-hot-cakes/|5.2|Stuart Berman

The Brooklyn musician's day job consists of sitting behind the kit for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a>, Slumberland revivalists that first gained attention by building a time-traveling rocketship for all those bookish, next-gen indie-poppers who had never heard of Rocketship. A few years before that, though, he was a member of unheralded, neo-shoegaze outfit, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5625-the-depreciation-guild/"" target=""_blank"">the Depreciation Guild</a>, a band that kicked things off by merging brittle chiptune textures with six-string swarm before arriving at the blissful, comfortable conclusion that, if the style itself ain't broke just yet, there's no need to fix it.</p>
<p>The projects that Feldman's been involved with over the last half-decade have been almost exclusively beholden to past sounds, so it shouldn't come as any surprise that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30419-ice-choir/"" target=""_blank"">Ice Choir</a>, his mostly-solo endeavor following the Depreciation Guild's dissolution last year, once again finds him looking back with reverence. This time, though, the source material is different-- as well as a little surprising, considering his largely rock-heavy background-- as Ice Choir's debut LP, <i>Afar</i>, teems with the lush, swooning textures and big-money eccentricities of 80s pop and new-wave. Granted, when written out, that description is ripe for suspicion; various forms of independent subculture have spent the last few years as Inuits with an internet connection, consuming and discarding the 80s' every cultural facet until the decade itself resembles an imprint of where an animal carcass once lay. Some of the cannibalism has taken place under the guise of sincerity, while a lot of it has reeked of cynical opportunism.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Afar</i>, however, it's very difficult to believe that Feldman, who wrote and produced the album by himself, is anything but totally serious about this new path he's travelling on. He doesn't just orbit around the usual reference points (Spandau Ballet, the jittery brightness of Jam &amp; Lewis-produced R&amp;B, OMD's more mainstream material)-- he nails them spot-on with an impressive and loving faithfulness, the only thing separating ""then"" from ""now"" being that I'm pretty sure nobody was gazing at a glowing computer screen while listening to ""If You Leave"" back in 1986. The crude, intentional cheapness that accompanies many a nostalgia-mining DIY act nowadays is avoided thanks to Feldman's own glossy production sheen, as well as the deft mixing hand of Jorge Elbrecht.</p>
<p>Elbrecht and Feldman are something of kindred spirits, since the former's band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28480-violens/"" target=""_blank"">Violens</a>, are capable copyists as well; given Elbrecht's commendably warm and distant self-production on Violens' second LP, this year's <i>True</i>, he's an obviously inspired choice for collaboration. Same goes for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift/"" target=""_blank"">Chairlift</a>'s Caroline Polachek, although her brief cameo on <i>Afar</i>'s twinkling closer ""Everything Is Spoilt by Use"" briefly disturbs the environment around her before slipping back into perceived, unmemorable nothingness. Not exactly her fault, though, since <i>Afar</i>'s hermetically sealed environment owes greatly to the singular voice of its creator. As a vocalist, Feldman impossibly smacks of another uncanny genre-hopper, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4116-scritti-politti/"" target=""_blank"">Scritti Politti</a>'s Green Gartside. Kurt Feldman's voice is rubbery and capable as it races alongside the quick-footed patter of ""Bounding"" and trickles down the lovely synthetic waterfalls of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13579-teletrips/"" target=""_blank"">""Teletrips""</a>-- but it also retains an aromatic lightness, the same sort of wonderfully overpowering perfume that's caused many a listener to fall in love with Gartside's most affecting vocal performances.</p>
<p>The artistic connection is only cosmetic, though, and not just because Gartside's status as a fascinating, thoughtful pop innovator is, at this point, inimitable. As far as this sleek, lovely new sound of his is concerned, Kurt Feldman's got all the parts required, but he hasn't quite figured out how to perfectly put them together yet, to create songs as indelible as the ones immaculately fashioned by his heroes from the past. That's fine, though, because even <i>Afar</i>'s most sketchily drawn material suggests that there's greater potential lying ahead-- and, besides, history has practically proven that he's bound to improve on what's here, since the Depreciation Guild's swan song, 2010's <i>Spirit Youth</i>, was richer and more complex than the 8-bit daggers of 2007's debut <i>In Her Gentle Jaws</i> (the former also yielded the project's finest stroke of post-adolescent romance, ""Crucify You""). The past isn't just on Feldman's mind-- it could be very well on his side, too.</p></div>"|16934.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16934-afar/|7.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

At its best, it renders you glassy-eyed, interacting with its texture the way you would a particularly plush rug after multiple bong rips: pure, mindless feel. The band builds one titanic, steady wall of sound over 37 minutes that never shifts dramatically: It thickens, lightens, surges, subsides. It's mantra music, and if it succeeds, it commands your senses on a level that surpasses faculties of articulation entirely.</p>
<p>The band, which formed in 2010, has roots in several other heady, transcendence-focused efforts. Its main member is Greg Fox, the calmly superhuman drummer who departed from art-metal outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"" target=""_blank"">Liturgy</a> last year, dealing such a crippling blow to that band's DNA that they still appear to be sorting out how to continue existing. (They have currently opted for a brutal drum machine that almost works as a bleak meta-joke about his irreplaceability.) Lead singer and guitarist Alex Drewchin of the psych-pop band Eartheater claims heavy influence from Sufi mysticism. Turner Williams, Jr., performs on a woody, note-bending zither instrument called a shaahi baja. Other sometime members include guitarist Bernard Gann, still of Liturgy, and bassist Eli Winograd, who plays in a noise-folk band called Two Prong. Together, they produce a sweat-slicked, heavily perfumed chemistry, an opium den with ventilation problems.</p>
<p>The single composition that is <i>See the World Given to a One Love Entity</i> looks as aimless as a screensaver on the surface, but the outfit maintains a light-fingered grip on the music's pulse, steering it through extended soloing passages without slackening the album's basic through-line. The record glows with the intensity of their shared concentration. It is an experience to be taken whole or not at all: There is about as much use in noting the music's developments as there is in narrating the details of an acid trip. An upsetting asphyxiated baby-goat-like noise at about the 21:20 mark surfaces from the bottom of the music's texture, floats to the top, and sends a shiver up your spine. Then, it stops, the drone closes back in, and the music's serene bubble reforms.</p>
<p>If there is a single thing to take away from the totality of <i>See the World</i>, it is the sheer joy of hearing Greg Fox drumming again. If you think of drumming, somehow, as mechanically rhythmic, or purely muscular, or a bedrock function upon which more melodic and/or dynamic things are laid-- if you don't listen to a lot of other music outside rock, in other words-- Fox might be a good gateway drug out of this line of thinking. His drumming has a harp player's nuance and inner voicings. The album's pulse never overly complicates itself, but Fox's playing is its own lesson on how to keep time while dancing atop it. He is on a short list of drummers whose extended solos you could easily imagine listening to.</p>
<p><i>See the World</i> belongs in a lineage of tribal guitar rock bands meant to shake loose titanic emotions: Oneida, Boredoms, Grails, Swans, Om. Of all of these groups, they have the least amount of dread and darkness: The music is heavy, and very impressive, but slightly monochromatic. There is none of the clammy, wide-eyed approaching-Gorgon horror of Swans, the quasi-religious release of Oneida or Om, the dark mystery of Grails. If they fall short in any way, it's in the somewhat limited range of third-eye-opening options they provide: Maybe over time, they can take on more colors.</p></div>"|16890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16890-see-the-world-given-to-a-one-love-entity/|7.2|Jayson Greene

In the tight-knit, hook-oriented corner of the American punk underground where the band's co-songwriters, <a href=""http://allisoncrutchfield.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Allison Crutchfield</a> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/mrkylegilbride"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kyle Gilbride</a>, came to meet, the 23-year-old Crutchfield has already achieved cultish notoriety with her twin sister Katie for writing honest songs. Their Alabama-bred, 1990s-indebted pop-punk band <a href=""http://pseliot.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">P.S. Eliot</a> (2007-2011), for which Katie wrote music and Allison played drums, were cherished by feminist punks who valued transparency and community over aesthetics. When P.S. Eliot disbanded last year-- because they'd ""creatively accomplished everything [they] set out to and dragging [the band] out would be brazen and pointless,"" Katie said-- I had several friends travel hours to watch them perform one last time in Brooklyn. And at least one who cried.</p>
<p>While Katie's post-P.S. Eliot life has taken her toward <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-lelcDrDg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stark, acoustic storytelling</a>, muffling her sweet-sung words with lo-fi home-recordings, Allison has stepped up from behind the kit to deliver upbeat and fuzz-laden guitar pop on the self-recorded <i>Swearin'</i>. Moving between brittle guitar crunch and quiet lo-fi tunes, the album recalls the pace of Unrest's <i>Perfect Teeth</i>, but with re-readings of classic 90s indie à la Superchunk, Built to Spill, and the Breeders. Throughout Crutchfield's voice hints at the youthful candor of Amy Linton in Henry's Dress, or occasionally the bolder Anna Waronker of underrated 90s alt rockers that dog., while Kyle Gilbride (the two are a couple) offers bright Doug Martsch impressions. Although <i>Swearin'</i> looks beyond pop-punk toward something more distinct and considered, as a whole it still suggests writers who learned a thing or two about melodic punk poetry from Jawbreaker or the Promise Ring. The album's first cut, ""1"", conjures a sentiment of exploration: ""I'm not satisfied with all of our instincts,"" Crutchfield sings, ""I won't let it slide/ I will follow it.""</p>
<p><i>Swearin'</i> channels the feeling of being in your early-to-mid 20s in the most intuitive way: scrappy, snarky rock, unshakeable hooks, and genuine lyrics. On ""Fat Chance"" Crutchfield promises to leave home (""I'll move out of this house/ I will get my own place"") and makes existential realizations (""Forever is a long time""); on ""Hundreds and Thousands"" she offers images of a hellish blue ocean, seedy motels, and dive bars before settling on moving east. Self-doubt and transience are recurring themes, and the acute details that permeate each song make them sound fit for only a small circle of friends (which is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDKpDji6nKc&amp;feature=player_embedded"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">basically</a> what's been going on for Swearin'). On mini-anthem ""Movie Star"", Crutchfield muses on one of young adulthood's most essential truths: ""You and me don't earn much pay/ But you and me got enough to get away/ If we want to.""</p>
<p>""Kenosha"" is Crutchfield's best song here, making charming use of words like ""precariously"" and ""malignant"" before hitting the thoroughly impatient (and also ebullient) chorus: ""I hope you like Kenosha so much you stay there forever, and we all lose touch,"" she sings, with a touch of evil. It's a forthright, cutting sentiment that affirms Crutchfield's stance as an eloquent lyrical fighter, one she began to set with ""What a Dump"", a demo track about street harassment and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehUKzMeaNGA&amp;feature=relmfu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""and how much it sucks""</a> that is regretfully absent from the album.</p>
<p>Gilbride can also be exceptionally poignant, with a habit of singing specific verses that conclude on brilliantly resonant lines. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14006-here-to-hear/"" target=""_blank"">""Here to Hear""</a>, in particular, conveys a real sense of post-college disorientation and uncertainty. ""Moving back here/ Feeling too self aware,"" he sings, emotively. ""I keep thinking/ Is this as good as it gets?"" Elsewhere he sounds pissed off (the rocket-fire ""Crashing""), and his guitar solos, though accomplished, also show restraint. On the soft-strummed downer ballad ""Empty Head"", he sounds like J Mascis without the mountains of noise: ""It's sad to want it back/ My time again/ It's not like anything was better then."" For a record that on the surface seems characterized by its outpouring of energy, it's beguiling to find that the saddest <i>Swearin' </i>song is also one of its most memorable.</p>
<p>A sappy verse-trading love song seems inevitable for <i>Swearin'</i>; the immensely hooky ""Just"" works due in no small part to Crutchfield and Gilbride's ability to paint evocative images. Crutchfield recounts sticky skin and streetlights and a first encounter with love, and later her internal musings are matched by Kyle's simultaneous self-loathing: ""I came in empty and I broke the lock/ It's dark around me/ Overslept and I'm alone a lot/ No one's asking."" It feels like a film that flips between scenes. For all the parallels to twee pop of the 1990s, and the many bands who have drawn similar indie rock reference points in recent years, <i>Swearin'</i> favors direct expression over style, something Crutchfield articulates early on ""Fat Chance"": ""An artist's mind is stimulated by the aesthetic/ And I don't know about art/ But I think your music's shit."" That line could alienate some listeners, but it's refreshing to find a group that sounds sincerely as though it's got nothing to hide.</p></div>"|17061.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17061-swearin/|7.8|Jenn Pelly

Less likely is the possibility that it's also an acknowledgement of the four contentious years that have passed since their last LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12130-intimacy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Intimacy</i></a>, which included rumors that the band was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44139-bloc-party-kicks-out-kele-okereke/"">breaking up or even considering moving on without Kele Okereke.</a> The implicit solidarity pledge makes sense since the bulk of <i>Four </i>is built from the same elements as 2005's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1130-silent-alarm/"" target=""_blank"">Silent Alarm</a></i>, by far their most popular album--<i> </i>sharp, pugilistic dual-guitar interplay, Okereke's S.O.S. vocal mannerisms, a jittery human rhythm section rather than a drum machine. But everyone appears to have lost a slight but significant step over the past seven years, and <i>Four </i>conveys the experience of watching an athlete reliant on explosive physicality realize that his body is betraying him. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Take ""He Begins to Lie"" and ""Team A"", the sort of Bloc Party songs that once could have stopped and cut on a dime but now just awkwardly slam into the chorus. Too often on <i>Four</i>, Okereke and Russell Lissack forgo serrated guitar hooks for blunt grunge riffing, and the rhythm section has become a wholly reactive entity, unable to push a song if and when the melodies fail. While Okereke's voice is recorded curiously low and subject to numerous filters throughout <i>Four,</i> he's still ""got it"" to an extent: His unhinged belting saves the otherwise unmemorable ""3x3"", and a spirited ""we can feel it in our bones!"" cuts through the plodding ""Kettling"". But otherwise, the effort's there without the inspiration, and when he peppers his lyrics with hashtag hopefuls like ""snitches get stitches,"" ""the empire never ended,"" ""let me show you how we do in my hood,"" and ""you can be the one percent if you wanna!"" his sloganeering morphs into something closer to non sequitur.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But even if they don't have the physical stamina to properly recreate <i>Silent Alarm, </i>that's no reason to hold them back. Bloc Party started to prove that they were becoming more adept at being lovers than fighters, and past highlights such as ""I Still Remember"", ""Blue Light"", and ""Signs"" were gushing love songs as spirited and gripping as their ones about gas prices and such. While <i>Four </i>is just about there rather than noticeably bad most of the time, any suspicion that its biggest crime is not being as good as <i>Silent Alarm </i>can be quelled by the utterly dumbfounding ""We Are Not Good People"" and ""Coliseum"", which respectively find Bloc Party <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZs_Py-1_0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">breaking their rusty cage and running</a> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg-HZd4Lb2Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">touch, peel, and stand</a> at the intersection of MTV ""Unplugged"" and ""Headbanger's Ball"". There's nothing wrong with finding new influences, but it's unfathomable that these were two of the best 12 songs they came up with over the span of an Olympiad. That said, they are the only times where Bloc Party actually sound like they're having as much fun as they want you to think they are.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's all unconvincing because out of the post-punk Class of 05, Bloc Party were the ones voted ""most likely to succeed"" while the likes of Futureheads and Maximo Park were actually out partying. Bloc Party's 2007 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9859-a-weekend-in-the-city/"" target=""_blank"">A Weekend in the City </a></i>was personally revealing, sonically bold, and sorely underappreciated, and while <i>Intimacy </i>was rushed and not particularly strong, it at least had a sense of direction. Combined with Okereke's actual dance-focused solo album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14381-the-boxer/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Boxer </i></a>and his work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5681-hercules-and-love-affair/"" target=""_blank"">Hercules and Love Affair</a>, it's clear <i>Silent Alarm </i>was a launching pad, not a nest. Maybe that's the message of this record's best song: ""V.A.L.I.S."" describes the kind of man you hate to see your ex with, one that plays by the rules and has things figured out. Okereke tellingly admits before <i>Four's </i>sole effortlessly catchy hook: ""He's not the real me."" It's ultimately debatable whether or not <i>Four </i>is the ""real"" Bloc Party, but revisionist history isn't supposed to be a duller version of the real thing.</p>

By the time Gift of Gab and Chief Xcel finally got around to recording a follow-up, the label they were on had dissolved, and underground hip-hop's independent-label ranks had become uncomfortably crowded. But 1999's <i>A2G</i> EP, as well as that year's <i>Nia</i>, caught on anyway, and eventually that first release of theirs started taking on the mythical ""early classic"" status that elusive, pre-fame records get when they start getting, say, <a href=""http://www.popsike.com/Blackalicious-Melodica-EP-Solesides-SEALED-MINT-OOP-Original-US-pressing-record/190593636493.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">$75 rare</a>. Four of the EP's seven tracks eventually made their way to the 2000 compilation <i>Solesides Greatest Bumps</i>, which had the maddening effect of revealing that at least some of <i>Melodica</i> was great while the rest leaving plenty to the imagination.</p>
<p>This re-release of <i>Melodica</i> is the first official digital edition, as well as the first effort to consolidate all the tracks, instrumentals aside, that made it onto both the Solesides original and <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/Mo%20Wax"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mo Wax</a> import editions of the EP. As a reissue, it's definitive, but as a time capsule, it's crucial: As an early installation of what would be one of California's most prominent components of the scene, <i>Melodica</i> is an appealing example of what independent rappers could pull off once they got the notion that they didn't have anyone else to answer to but themselves and their fans. This is conscious-minded, lyrically technical underground hip-hop at its rawest and, sometimes, at its most over-the-top ridiculous.</p>
<p>Hopefully, that doesn't sound like a warning, but the appeal of this stuff does hinge on an ear for the kind of elaborate bombast that plays chicken with self-parody. The hyperactive unpredictability of Gab's delivery can be overwhelming, especially when he delivers avalanches of fast-spit assonant wordplay that seem to defy punctuation. (Anyone that transcribes ""Lyric Fathom"" or ""Rhymes for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind"" while using line breaks is doing it wrong.) But while it's trendy to crown this style as ""lyrical lyricist"" stuff, there's some real ankle-breaking work here; at some points he approaches doing for syllables what Thelonious Monk did for notes, bending emphasis and pulling clutch-rupturing gearshifts in his flow that draw more whiplash victims than any peer West of Pharoahe Monch.</p>
<p>And while super-technical performances like his berserk turn in ""Deep in the Jungle"" bring the flash (""Gifted when I'm lifted off a spliff hit/ Reminisce shit, riff with dipshits/ This shit is the misfit style of the gifted/ I'm a whiz kid, get a whiff kid""), Gab's more laidback, downtempo moments-- ""Swan Lake"", ""Attica Black"", ""Changes""-- show that he still had a talent for building relaxed, breathable verses as well. That skill works with the other, most prominent quality of his voice-- the burbly, nasal tone that sounds amiably mellow even when he's preposterously threatening to ""rip off your arm and throw it in a stew"" or some similar bit of battle-rap goofiness. His vocal tone has always been one of Gab's more relatable qualities-- even if it trips him up occasionally, lending an unintentional flippancy to the alcoholic hard luck story ""40oz for Breakfast"". When it really works, it lends this odd sense of humility that undercuts his diabolical words and gives weight to his modest ones. There's a line in ""Swan Lake"" where he admits that he's ""not sayin' I'm the baddest but I know I got potential"", a modest shrug that would sound disingenuous from any other voice. Here, it's as empathy-provoking as the bit where he's really bummed about getting burned off a $20 bag of shitty weed.</p>
<p>Blackalicious' potential was fulfilled by the time those two '99 releases hit college radio rotation, but those records carry the consequence of making some of the production on <i>Melodica</i> sound fairly first-draft by comparison. Not all of it, granted: ""Swan Lake"" is a neat bit of cratedigger streamlining that merges three different early 70s soul-jazz covers of the Stylistics' ""People Make the World Go Round"" in its structure. And the rare, out-of-the-vaults ""Changes"" is an immersive dose of lo-fi psychedelic soul with a murky yet hard-hitting drum break beneath.</p>
<p>Both of those tracks featured <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1113-dj-shadow/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Shadow</a> co-producing with Chief Xcel, while the EP's other best beats-- the fuzzed-out acid-funk ""Rhymes for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind"" and the minimalist, ""Song for My Father""-quoting ""40oz for Breakfast""-- were the results of Shadow working alone. Considering Chief Xcel is the producer who'd later give us intricately heavy beats like ""You Didn't Know That Though"", ""Passion"", and ""The Craft"", not much here really knocks on his side of the table, and there's a couple questionable loops-- the comedic horns and disjointed sampled hook of ""Lyric Fathom""; the lounge-act organ on ""Deep in the Jungle""-- that are almost annoyingly dissonant. But there were better things to come, and so <i>Melodica</i> is worth its place in history.</p></div>"|16956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16956-melodica/|7.5|Nate Patrin

""When you're workshopping it, a lot of stuff is bumpy and awkward... [A comedian] is essentially in the gym,"" he said. ""You're mad at Ray Leonard because he's not in shape, in the gym? That's what the gym's for."" I immediately considered the career of <a href=""http://www.basedworld.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lil B</a>, an artist who refuses-- or is flatly unable-- to trade his metaphorical treadmill for the ring. He exists in an unapologetic state of workshop. His best mixtapes are still bad and his worst mixtapes are still good, because they are all so delightfully bumpy and awkward. There is still no endgame, which makes Lil B at once the most exhausting, unmanageable, and-- even though his catalog is wildly uneven by all standards-- the most reliable artist we have. </p>
<p>For those out there who haven't kept up with his inhuman pace, here's a quick rundown of what Lil B has churned out in his workshop since he last appeared in these pages:  The <i>#1 Bitch</i> mixtape, which samples ""The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)"" and includes the appetizingly titled Based Freestyle ""Ima Eat Her Ass"". The <i>Basedprint 2</i> mixtape (no first volume necessary). The hilariously gruff <i>Trapped in Basedworld</i> mixtape. A highly confusing hour and a half of instrumental ""classical music"" called <i>Choices and Flowers</i>. Another installation of his <i>Flame</i> mixtape series, this time in honor of the color green. Four more mixtapes, each 16 tracks or more. An <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47049-lil-b-releases-855-song-mixtape/"" target=""_blank"">855-song Based Freestyle compilation</a> for which you'd need to carve out five gigs of hard drive space and hours to complete. It is staggering: You could listen to no one but Lil B in 2012 and never once long for new material. His workhorse stamina makes Curren$y look like a sprinter. </p>
<p>His latest mixtape, <i>Obama Basedgod</i>-- a title uttered on ""I Own Swag"", a track off <i>God's Father</i> and one of his most marketable to date-- is perhaps his most straightforward, <i>rap</i>-rap release since 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15641-im-gay-im-happy/"" target=""_blank""><i>I'm Gay (I'm Happy)</i></a>. As you might expect from a release referencing a United States president, <i>Obama Basedgod</i> tackles social ills the only way Lil B knows how: through a free-flowing and meditative lens, wobbling between heartfelt and absurdist winking. But more often than not he's heartfelt here, openly confessing his day-to-day worries with more specificity and less theatricality than we're used to. ""I ain't got no fuckin' problems/ Actually I'm lyin', man, I got a lot of problems,"" he raps on ""Government Imported"", a track that lifts the beat from Jay-Z's ""This Can't Be Life"".</p>
<p>On the production end, Lil B stokes nostalgia for the Diplomats' or Hov's heyday with sped-up soul and Motown singles throughout. He's been so freewheeling in recent months (""Bitch, I'm a cow, swag!"" A song rapped in Spanglish called ""Gato Gato""! A tribute to NYU students!) that it's revelatory to hear him discuss something as simple as his own financial troubles. ""Freeway trips and I ain't have no money/ You can look me in my eyes, I look fine/ I practice every day to hide the pain inside,"" he raps on ""Freeway Trips"". The prismatic title track, on which he raps, ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious/ Dump his head in the car/ Dump his body in the ocean"" is misleading in its whimsicality. </p>
<p>Despite its charms, <i>Obama Basedgod</i> is often downright boring, joyless, and indistinguishable from hours upon hours of the rapper's throwaway material. If Lil B whittled his work down to a best-of compilation he'd have several top-shelf rap albums; nothing from <i>Obama Basedgod</i> would appear on it. But I much prefer the gentle view from inside his workshop to the possibility of a polished final product that excludes a mixtape like this one. Lil B is the poster child for the John Lennon-coined cliché of ""Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans"" in that he refuses to make plans at all. His work is all process, full of unedited life. <i>Obama Basedgod</i> is ultimately an insignificant piece to the Lil B puzzle, but that's the point-- without the excess, the dependable comforts of the curious hum of his machine would fade to black.</p></div>"|17060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17060-obama-basedgod/|5.5|Carrie Battan

(The women featured in the photos are credited and ""thanked,"" presumably to make it explicit that exploitation is not the name of the game.) The message is clear, then: LuckyMe are all about good times, and in 2012, the increasingly hip label's had a few reasons to keep the taps flowing. Several productions from canny dance cipher Machinedrum's EP released at the top of the year, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16196-sxlnd-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>SXLND</i></a>, were used as backing tracks by perpetually buzz-cresting mer-rapper Azealia Banks; just last month, LuckyMe joined Warp in co-releasing the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16854-tnght-ep/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a> EP from Hudson Mohawke and Lunice's TNGHT project, a forward-thinking document that captures the increasingly blurred lines between dance and hip-hop. All things considered, a pretty good year so far.</p>
<p>So there's quite a few eyes (and ears) on what LuckyMe's next move is, and as it turns out, it's a bit of a curveball: the debut release from Vienna musician Clemens Bächer, who twiddles the knobs as <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cidrim"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cid Rim</a> when not collaborating with fellow Austrian beatmaker Dorian Concept. Bächer's a percussionist by trade who tutors and performs in the free jazz realm for a living, so it follows that his productions are heavy on rhythmic patterns that sound slightly off-kilter and disorienting. Snatches of organic fills stud the background of ""Six Hundred""'s punchy synths, while ""A Fall Four Two"" is practically a drum kit solo in slow-motion, with warm tones and what sounds like mallet instruments filling out the leftover space. In Bächer's hands, almost every instrument-- right down to the high-contrast synths and vocal samples smattered throughout the record-- turns into a weapon of rhythmic assault. At times, it's fun to lose yourself in his beat maps, even if the migraine-causing potential while listening is frequently high.</p>
<p>Ironically, for all its relative busyness and occasional aggressive textures, Bächer's work feels very <i>small</i> in stature. Maybe this is partially because, despite its running time of 36 minutes, LuckyMe has branded this release as a ""micro-album."" Even doing away with what people are calling this thing, though, <i>Cid Rim</i> often sounds handmade and intimate, a more playful variation on what comes from the bedroom-IDM types that make up the roster of U.S. boutique Ghostly International. Even the boldest-sounding material here-- the upward build of ""Manage Expectations"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13878-danger-ranger/"" target=""_blank"">""Danger Ranger""</a>'s vocal swarm-- carries an air of restraint, as if it's sitting on a bench near a cliff instead of standing on the edge. The prevailing narrative that's emerged in the last 12 months when concerning Bächer's peers is that of maximalism, where productions most closely resemble setting off an entire fireworks display all at once. While there's plenty going on with <i>Cid Rim</i>, the sense of closeness and propriety makes it out of step in the current landscape, an admirable facet that suggests Bächer's not afraid to march to the step of his own drum kit.</p>
<p>Still, it says something that the standout on <i>Cid Rim</i> is not an original production, but a remix of the album's leadoff cut, ""Draw"", courtesy of Dorian Concept. DC's remix first appeared on Rustie's scene-defining <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16498-essential-mix/"" target=""_blank"">BBC Essential Mix</a> earlier this year, and among the two hours of total aural insanity, it was definitely a highlight, so it's a total treat (and worth the price of purchase alone) to hear the cut's cartoonish, boss-mode synth stomps-- which sound so sharp and tangy, while retaining plenty of menace-- coated in non-radio-rip HD glory that does it justice. Bächer should take heed, though, that it's not necessarily a good look to be shown up at your own function, so maybe the next time around he'll adopt some crude brashness of his own.</p></div>"|17008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17008-cid-rim/|6.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

After leaping and bounding from the raw violence of San Francisco's VON to the primitive hatred of Chicago's Heidegger-referencing Judas Iscariot and Oakton, Va.'s politically unsavory Grand Belial's Key, then spiraling inwards into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4941-xasthur/"" target=""_blank"">Xasthur's</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5778-leviathan/"" target=""_blank"">Leviathan's</a> yawning one-man Calif. voids and the foundation-shattering entity that was San Fancisco's atmospheric time-stretchers Weakling-- USBM has somehow ended up, at least in a stereotypical sense, somewhere between Berkeley and Brooklyn.</p>
<p>California is the more prolific of the two, having given us Fell Voices, Ludicra, Bone Awl, Volahn, <a href=""http://ash-borer.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ash Borer</a>, and by extension, now-OGs Fauna and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4783-wolves-in-the-throne-room/"" target=""_blank"">Wolves in the Throne Room</a>, as well as perhaps the most important American black metal band of all. Weakling's influence in particular cannot and will not ever be given enough credit in terms of the crop of bands that surfaced in the mid-to-late 2000's, and it's nice to see that their legacy continues to sink its claws into newer acolytes. They're an easy comparison, but it wouldn't be such a lazy move to automatically cite vocalist/guitarist John Gossard and co. in a USBM review if 2000's landmark LP <i>Dead as Dreams</i> weren't hardwired into the framework of seemingly every release with even a bit of blackness about it.</p>
<p>Arcata, Calif., quintet Ash Borer, however, are far from a Weakling ripoff-- they're not even a Wolves in the Throne Room ripoff, or any sort of ripoff at all. While creating a sound that is distinctly American in execution, the band's five members pull together to impart their own distinct sonic sensibilities onto their winding, droning sagas; there is plenty of doom and gloom lurking beneath their second album <i>Cold of Ages</i>' malevolently sharp black metal riffs and grating howls. The nearly 17-minute-long opener, ""Descended Lamentations"", is a cold, eerie offering, chaotic and intense, populated by harrowing melodies and desperate, heaving wails. Ash Borer's accentual use of keys adds just the right touch of Northern chill to the proceedings, especially during the track's opening moments. Meticulously timed and purposefully varied, ""Descended Lamentations"" veers between hypnotic and harrowing; it wouldn't make sense as a shorter composition, and each second has its purpose. ""Phantoms"" carries on into murkier territory; the chords are less bright, the tempo slower, the mood darker. The pace picks up, as it always does, and ""Phantoms"" rages against the dying of the light before sinking back into silence. The soft to loud dynamic is alive and well, and translates nicely into Ash Borer's somber, smoldering tunes.</p>
<p>""Convict All Flesh"" starts out drowning in reverb and droning along in single notes, shuddering along as a dead man's crawl until a flurry of blastbeats appears and reanimates the doomed soul. A choir of sweet-voiced angels-- aka <span class=""st"">Jessica Way of San Francisco's Worm Ouroboros--</span> appears to intervene on his behalf, but the Devil's after his due, and no one is exempt. Roaring into the void, hopeless and bereft, Ash Borer are not a happy band at the best of times, and when they really step back and allow the darkness to seep through, it doesn't get much more lightless. Finaly, closer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14037-removed-forms/"" target=""_blank"">""Removed Forms""</a> is muted, strung out along a single note and voiced by that same choir of clear, high female voices until panicky chords signal the beginning of the end and all hell breaks loose. The last few minutes are entrancing, and well worth the wait.</p>
<p>Borrowing doom metal's syrupy pace and despondent air, cozying up to distorted fuzz and droning reverb, and refusing to veer too far from their ragged black metal core, Ash Borer are many things at once, and nothing but themselves. Their much ballyhooed earlier material (demos, 2010's excellent split with Fell Voices, and their 2011 self-titled LP) deserved the hype, but with their second long player, things have taken a darker turn. Their debut was rife with the slick, crystalline chords that makes USBM sound so ""pretty,"" but this time, Ash Borer have gotten their hands a little dirty: <i>Cold of Ages</i> is a big leap forward for a band that had already started out a few steps ahead of the pack.</p></div>"|17004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17004-cold-of-ages/|8.0|Kim Kelly

The band's self-titled 1968 debut was the product of what was, at that time, a London-based blues-rock four-piece fronted by guitarist/vocalist Peter Green; the second came out nine albums later, in 1975, and solidified their iconic lineup. Up until then, the group had cycled through members, gradually transforming into a more stable pop-rock unit. Christine McVie joined in 1970, and a few years later, they landed in Southern California where they hooked up with Lindsey Buckingham and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23583-stevie-nicks/"" target=""_blank"">Stevie Nicks</a>, folding in the meticulous pop theatrics and smoky confessionals that would make for three of the band's best-loved albums-- <i>Fleetwood Mac</i>, <i>Rumours</i>, and <i>Tusk--</i> which tend to overshadow what came before.</p>
<p>So if you're noted music supervisor Randall Poster and you're looking to pay tribute to a major rock'n'roll band for a Starbucks-sold cover-songs compilation, there are much less slippery subjects than Fleetwood Mac. <i>Just Tell Me That You Want Me</i> aims to span Fleetwood Mac's whole existence-- not just the culturally ambient early Buckingham/Nicks stuff but also the murky hinterlands of the band's 17-album catalog. Given that scope, it's a mission that, when limited to just 17 tracks, is all but destined to fail. </p>
<p>Granted, Poster is one of the best in his field: He's been behind all of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8877-wes-anderson/"" target=""_blank"">Wes Anderson</a>'s soundtracks, as well as Todd Haynes' <i>I'm Not There</i>, for which he wrangled three dozen artists' to take on the Bob Dylan songs over two discs. His <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15588-rave-on-a-tribute-to-buddy-holly/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rave On Buddy Holly</i></a> homage (released last year, also via Starbucks' Hear Music label) was serviceable, but drew from a catalog curtailed long ago. But Fleetwood Mac's songs are already so fully formed-- not just intricately-wrought as studio productions but, as with many of the selections presented here, fully ground into the collective mind of its target audience. Covers are tricky things; there's not so much a thin line between stenography and blasphemy as a wild rocky gulf of bemusement and horror and inexplicable pleasure. </p>
<p>The record's first few tracks proceed with an admirable sense of reverence. There's no discernible order to the sequencing, but the first is also the oldest Mac song present: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13847-albatross-fleetwood-mac-cover-ft-j-mascis/"" target=""_blank"">""Albatross""</a>, an instrumental that was a hit for the band's original incarnation, is rendered huge and gasping by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2057-lee-ranaldo/"" target=""_blank"">Lee Ranaldo</a> Band and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"" target=""_blank"">J Mascis</a>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/"" target=""_blank"">Antony</a>'s faithfully elegiac take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47014-listen-mgmt-and-antony-cover-fleetwood-mac/"" target=""_blank"">""Landslide""</a> comes next, almost cruelly; it would have been a shame to bury it at the end, but it just seems unfair to the artists tasked with following it. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5734-lykke-li/"" target=""_blank"">Lykke Li</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47013-listen-lykke-li-covers-fleetwood-mac/"" target=""_blank"">""Silver Springs""</a>, a few tracks later, is the only other cut that competes; swathed in reverb almost thicker than the song's own emotional chainmail, the track slowly builds up around her-- harmonies and menacing tambourines and a generally crushing fuzz-- but she stays so calm, as if she herself is summoning up the storm that's enveloping her. She retains much of Nicks' torn-up, worn-out sadness, but the original seems to be a million miles from her mind-- unlike <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/concordmusicgroup/gold-dust-woman"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gold Dust Woman""</a>, which follows next, on which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a> and his wiry guitar steer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28657-karen-elson/"" target=""_blank"">Karen Elson</a> run through a by-the-book Nicks homage.</p>
<p>The back half of the album is loaded with electronic material, which isn't a bad idea in theory, though none of it is particularly effective. In a reworking of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47183-listen-tame-impala-and-washed-out-cover-fleetwood-mac-for-tribute-compilation/"" target=""_blank"">""Straight Back""</a>, from <i>Mirage</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out/"" target=""_blank"">Washed Out</a> blows out the original's disco-flocked production, burying the vocals in shimmery wafts of synths and polyester beats; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a>'s flip take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47014-listen-mgmt-and-antony-cover-fleetwood-mac/"" target=""_blank"">""Future Games""</a> smothers the song in layers of gunky robo-vocals and stuttering digital blurts. With the exception of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2288-the-kills/"" target=""_blank"">the Kills</a>' menacing rendition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47134-listen-bonnie-prince-billy-the-kills-karen-elson-and-beck-lee-ranaldo-cover-fleetwood-mac/"" target=""_blank"">""Dreams""</a>, the second act seems designed as background music for suburban teen mall shoppers.</p>
<p>Then there's the unfortunate mismatches: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26449-the-new-pornographers/"" target=""_blank"">The New Pornographers</a> did just about what you'd expect to the jaunty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13773-think-about-me-fleetwood-mac-cover/"" target=""_blank"">""Think About Me""</a>, though it's hard not to yearn for what they could have done with ""Tusk"". That track was given instead to DFA Records' Crystal Ark, who replace the glorious bombast of the USC Trojan Marching band with drum machine whumps and skittery synth splurts. Among other mismatches, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">St. Vincent</a>'s Annie Clark is buried in the grinding murk of Craig Wedren's ""Sister of the Moon""-- try not to think about how much she'd have killed ""Gold Dust Woman"" if left to her own devices.</p>
<p>Some of these tracks work only so long as you can push all memory of the originals from your mind. If I'd somehow never heard the original cut of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46995-listenwatch-best-coast-cover-fleetwood-macs-rhiannon/"" target=""_blank"">""Rhiannon""</a>, I might find <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"" target=""_blank"">Best Coast</a>'s version sufficiently charming; knowing better, though, it leaves me in kind of a spluttering, stunned rage, like knocking back a whiskey shot before realizing it's apple juice. Bethany Cosentino does away not just with with Buckingham's witchy riff and Nicks's peaty vocals, but the song's crucial minor key altogether, subbing in a bouncy piano line and tweaking the end of each vocal line with a sweet curlicue, like the little swirl on the top of your Dairy Queen soft-serve. And what's true for her version is true for the collection as a whole. The original is a seduction; this is food-court flirtation. </p>
<p>The fact that the collection is a bit of a mess is a shame, but also a tribute to the band in its own way. I think of that line from ""Storms"", rendered here as a lovely, creaky lament by Bonnie 'Prince' Billy and Matt Sweeney, which rings true as ever: ""Never have I been a blue calm sea/ I have always been a storm.""</p></div>"|16926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16926-just-tell-me-that-you-want-me-tribute-to-fleetwood-mac/|5.6|Rachael Maddux

Few lyricists in indie rock are as funny or withering or willing to reveal uncomfortable truths straight to your face as Archers frontman Eric Bachmann, and few sounds are as deeply ingrained in the music as the crunch-and-whine of Bachmann and Eric Johnson's dueling guitars. Still, there are plenty who feel that, two records in, they'd made all the music they needed to make. ""Web in Front"", the glorious gutpunch that opens 1993's <i>Icky Mettle</i>, isn't just their finest song, it's their defining moment, their rocket-shot into the canon.</p>
<p>It was, in a way, all downhill from there: 1995's <i>Vee Vee</i> may be a (slightly) better record than <i>Icky</i>-- wider in scope, yet looser in approach-- and the 17 utterly riveting minutes of bloodletting that make up early EP <i>Vs. the Greatest of All Time</i> place it among indie rock's finest short-players. But that gate-charging momentum's never been easy thing for any young band to sustain, particularly one like the Archers, who arrived on the scene with veins already bulging from the sides of their heads. 1996's <i>All the Nations Airports</i> and 1998's more experimental bow-out <i>White Trash Heroes</i> are, like their predecessors, burly, testy, vital stuff, all mangled chords and full-body tantrums, shot through with an indelible passion. But, where there was once uncontrollable fire, there became instead a kind of intractable weariness, a feeling deeply ingrained into both of the Archers' final LPs. On early classics like ""Audiowhore"", they almost seemed to be screaming for their lives. On <i>Airports</i> and <i>White Trash Heroes</i>, they were screaming just to be heard, until they'd practically stopped screaming altogether.</p>
<p>When ""Harnessed in Slums"", the loser-licking highlight from the Archers' second masterstroke <i>Vee Vee</i>, made its way to alt-rock radio, the Archers found themselves with an opening slot on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"" target=""_blank"">Weezer</a>'s post-<i>Blue</i>, pre-<i>Pinkerton</i> tour and the ear of a few major labels. By all accounts, the tour was an unmitigated disaster, but for a minute there, some important eyes were on the Archers; though the obstinately independent band remained signees of the tiny Alias Records, they struck a deal with major-affiliate Elektra for distribution rights to what became <i>All the Nations Airports</i>. The strains of success-- such as it was-- are written right into the record's title track, one of those wonderfully paranoid Bachmann screeds complete with lumpy tourists, soused pilots, and scummy terrorists throwing 'bows.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, the new liners would have you believe <i>Airports</i> is, in fact, a positive jam, a Cinnabon-scented tribute to the peace they'd sometimes find in staring out of airplane windows, having temporarily ceded control to the TSA. Bachmann, then as now, isn't always easy to read; he's never less than lacerating, but he's rarely all that explicit about the would-be recipients of his simmering rage, easier to feel than to comprehend. Still, the asphyxiation-by-patchcord of ""Strangled by the Stereo Wire"" and the airport-as-Thunderdome one-two that opens <i>Airports</i> is pretty much impossible not to read as an expression of displeasure about the State of the Archers circa 1996. They'd found a little success, but they'd failed to make the leap, and all over <i>Airports</i>, you can feel Bachmann and the band struggling to make some sense of where they'd landed.</p>
<p><i>Airports</i> is their fullest-sounding record, and perhaps their most purely musical. Bachmann and Eric Johnson's two-guitar assault is prettied up a bit with a couple of piano ballads and the odd synthesizer lick, and quite a few of these tunes splinter off into loping instrumental breaks that, if not exactly capital-G gorgeous, feel less gnarled, more meditative than their equivalents on <i>Icky</i> and <i>Vee Vee</i>. And the chiming near-pop of ""Vocal Shrapnel"" belongs in the same breath as ""Wrong"" and ""Web"" among the catchiest stuff they ever did. But, more often as not, these songs corner themselves, strip themselves down for parts, devolve into noise and chaos; this is the sound of frustration, of an unerringly passionate band going for broke, throwing everything they could into a record.</p>
<p>Some of these excesses have an amplifying effect on Bachmann's vitriol; many of the rest seem to either crowd him out or drag him down. This is why an utter outlier like ""Chumming the Ocean""-- the prickly Archers at their loveliest-- is its finest song. The clear, blue piano ballad finds the perpetually put-upon Bachmann throwing a skyward first-- ""the hand of god chokes the driftwood with deadweight and brine,"" Bachmann belts-- but, up against all of the <i>Airports</i>' restless thrashing, it's a moment of zen, an eye in the storm, the one moment where Bachmann stepped back, sat down, and actually got to survey the territory. As ever, he didn't sound too pleased with what he'd found. ""Little things can cost you everything,"" Bachmann sighs, a hint of resignation in his voice.</p>
<p>In 1998, the venerable Robert Christgau suggested that other indie bands, on hearing <i>Airports</i>, ought to consider retirement. Archers did Bob one better: They went and made <i>White Trash Heroes</i>, and after another troublesome tour and a flare-up of drummer Mark Price's carpal tunnel, they bowed out for more than a decade. Certainly their strangest record, the slippery, synth-heavy <i>Heroes</i> was built differently than everything that came before it. The Archers swapped instruments, building songs piece-by-piece rather than wrestling raw material into strange shapes. The results are looser, often quieter, more synthetic and more surreal than anything they'd done before. Bachmann, too, favors the falsetto on <i>White Trash Heroes</i>, his screams giving way to, well, not quite a whisper.</p>
<p>Whatever the Archers sought from <i>White Trash Heroes</i>-- a kind of rejuvenation through dismantling-- they didn't quite get. With its unorthodox instrumentation and downturn in the sheer viscerality behind their first three records, <i>White Trash Heroes</i> moves at a different pace than what came before it, a kind of slump-shouldered perturbation that, 15 years on, still feels a little scattered and somewhat less than ingratiating. The sound is less physical, more cerebral, practically an inversion of their early work. Yet the songs themselves often feel a bit centerless, too simple by half, or simply too strange for their own good. ""Slick Tricks"" bleeds Brainiac's ""Flypaper"" dry, but outlier among outliers ""I.N.S."" comes in just a few clicks below sludge metal, and ostensible centerpiece ""One Slight Wrong Move"" starts as a clanging nightmarescape and ends as a vocoder-addled choogler.</p>
<p>Some of it works-- the seven minute title track, with its rare flashes of optimism, is among their best-- and some of it doesn't, but there's really no denying that very little of it comes off as well as the kind of dug-in indie-rock these guys had mastered on their very first song. And when a hint of that early clarity like ""Perfect Time"" cuts through the fray, it sends many of <i>Heroes</i>' less successful experiments into sharp relief. ""Banging on a Dead Drum"" is a howler, but it's so buried in fuzz, so utterly plonked by that cowbell, it's everywhere and nowhere at once. Same with things like the instrumental ""Smokers in Love""; built around a jaunty riff worthy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"" target=""_blank"">Battles</a>, it's not quite a focus-tanking distraction, but it's not really a well-timed diversion, either. Large swaths of <i>Heroes</i> find the raw nerve they'd spent the past five years tapping sounding shot, their resolve starting to slip. ""Let's fall behind, in perfect time,"" Bachmann sings, and he seemed determined to do just that. Yet, for all its flaws, <i>Heroes</i> captivates. Over time, the coldness of the music eventually inches a few degrees northward, and when they reconcile the weirdness of the music with Bachmann's fraught observations, as on ""Dead Red Eyes"", it could be spellbinding.</p>
<p>Both albums' bonus discs are largely comprised of 4-track demos, with a couple of solid-to-great B-sides for good measure. It's illuminating, if not exactly essential; a particularly gnarly take on its title track aside, <i>All the Nations Airports</i> sounds, in demo form, just about how you'd expect. The songs do pack a little more punch without all the adornment, but their gnarly fidelity will make this a one-and-done deal for most. <i>White Trash Heroes</i>' extra disc fares better; led by the punchy, autumnal ""Jive Kata""-- among their finest non-LP sides-- you can hear the strange evolution of <i>Heroes</i>' unusual construction in its early stages. Stripped of all its (presumably ironic) flash, the desperation and directionlessness at the heart of the gaudy ""One Slight Wrong Move"" comes to the fore, turning a slightly depressing piss-take into a plea for escape. On the whole, this music feels unusually restless, spacious, the anxious energy of the past given way to wearinesss, a great band pulling themselves apart in real time.</p>
<p><i>White Trash Heroes</i> may not be the final Archers of Loaf album all that much longer. After embarking on a series of reunion tours over the last year or so, in recent months, the rejuvenated Archers have given a number of interviews that suggest a new LP may not be out of the question. In those interviews, there's always a note from Bachmann suggesting that, if fans can expect anything at all, it won't be <i>White Trash Heroes</i> (or <i>Icky Mettle</i>, or <i>Vee Vee</i>, or what-have-you) part II. Rather, any new Archers music would most likely show off the influences and aggravations of the decade and change they've spent away, perhaps a bit more in line with the enviable run of Crooked Fingers records with which Bachmann has busied himself with since the Archers' initial split.</p>
<p>The Archers knew then, just as they know now, that a band's got to keep moving, or they'll die, and while it's not hard to hear their verve starting to fade a bit throughout the gnashing <i>Airports</i> and the precarious <i>Heroes</i>, you can't say they didn't go down swinging. Go see the Archers now, and you realize, gruff and inscrutable as they could sometimes be, they've always had good reason to shout.

Few lyricists in indie rock are as funny or withering or willing to reveal uncomfortable truths straight to your face as Archers frontman Eric Bachmann, and few sounds are as deeply ingrained in the music as the crunch-and-whine of Bachmann and Eric Johnson's dueling guitars. Still, there are plenty who feel that, two records in, they'd made all the music they needed to make. ""Web in Front"", the glorious gutpunch that opens 1993's <i>Icky Mettle</i>, isn't just their finest song, it's their defining moment, their rocket-shot into the canon.</p>
<p>It was, in a way, all downhill from there: 1995's <i>Vee Vee</i> may be a (slightly) better record than <i>Icky</i>-- wider in scope, yet looser in approach-- and the 17 utterly riveting minutes of bloodletting that make up early EP <i>Vs. the Greatest of All Time</i> place it among indie rock's finest short-players. But that gate-charging momentum's never been easy thing for any young band to sustain, particularly one like the Archers, who arrived on the scene with veins already bulging from the sides of their heads. 1996's <i>All the Nations Airports</i> and 1998's more experimental bow-out <i>White Trash Heroes</i> are, like their predecessors, burly, testy, vital stuff, all mangled chords and full-body tantrums, shot through with an indelible passion. But, where there was once uncontrollable fire, there became instead a kind of intractable weariness, a feeling deeply ingrained into both of the Archers' final LPs. On early classics like ""Audiowhore"", they almost seemed to be screaming for their lives. On <i>Airports</i> and <i>White Trash Heroes</i>, they were screaming just to be heard, until they'd practically stopped screaming altogether.</p>
<p>When ""Harnessed in Slums"", the loser-licking highlight from the Archers' second masterstroke <i>Vee Vee</i>, made its way to alt-rock radio, the Archers found themselves with an opening slot on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"" target=""_blank"">Weezer</a>'s post-<i>Blue</i>, pre-<i>Pinkerton</i> tour and the ear of a few major labels. By all accounts, the tour was an unmitigated disaster, but for a minute there, some important eyes were on the Archers; though the obstinately independent band remained signees of the tiny Alias Records, they struck a deal with major-affiliate Elektra for distribution rights to what became <i>All the Nations Airports</i>. The strains of success-- such as it was-- are written right into the record's title track, one of those wonderfully paranoid Bachmann screeds complete with lumpy tourists, soused pilots, and scummy terrorists throwing 'bows.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, the new liners would have you believe <i>Airports</i> is, in fact, a positive jam, a Cinnabon-scented tribute to the peace they'd sometimes find in staring out of airplane windows, having temporarily ceded control to the TSA. Bachmann, then as now, isn't always easy to read; he's never less than lacerating, but he's rarely all that explicit about the would-be recipients of his simmering rage, easier to feel than to comprehend. Still, the asphyxiation-by-patchcord of ""Strangled by the Stereo Wire"" and the airport-as-Thunderdome one-two that opens <i>Airports</i> is pretty much impossible not to read as an expression of displeasure about the State of the Archers circa 1996. They'd found a little success, but they'd failed to make the leap, and all over <i>Airports</i>, you can feel Bachmann and the band struggling to make some sense of where they'd landed.</p>
<p><i>Airports</i> is their fullest-sounding record, and perhaps their most purely musical. Bachmann and Eric Johnson's two-guitar assault is prettied up a bit with a couple of piano ballads and the odd synthesizer lick, and quite a few of these tunes splinter off into loping instrumental breaks that, if not exactly capital-G gorgeous, feel less gnarled, more meditative than their equivalents on <i>Icky</i> and <i>Vee Vee</i>. And the chiming near-pop of ""Vocal Shrapnel"" belongs in the same breath as ""Wrong"" and ""Web"" among the catchiest stuff they ever did. But, more often as not, these songs corner themselves, strip themselves down for parts, devolve into noise and chaos; this is the sound of frustration, of an unerringly passionate band going for broke, throwing everything they could into a record.</p>
<p>Some of these excesses have an amplifying effect on Bachmann's vitriol; many of the rest seem to either crowd him out or drag him down. This is why an utter outlier like ""Chumming the Ocean""-- the prickly Archers at their loveliest-- is its finest song. The clear, blue piano ballad finds the perpetually put-upon Bachmann throwing a skyward first-- ""the hand of god chokes the driftwood with deadweight and brine,"" Bachmann belts-- but, up against all of the <i>Airports</i>' restless thrashing, it's a moment of zen, an eye in the storm, the one moment where Bachmann stepped back, sat down, and actually got to survey the territory. As ever, he didn't sound too pleased with what he'd found. ""Little things can cost you everything,"" Bachmann sighs, a hint of resignation in his voice.</p>
<p>In 1998, the venerable Robert Christgau suggested that other indie bands, on hearing <i>Airports</i>, ought to consider retirement. Archers did Bob one better: They went and made <i>White Trash Heroes</i>, and after another troublesome tour and a flare-up of drummer Mark Price's carpal tunnel, they bowed out for more than a decade. Certainly their strangest record, the slippery, synth-heavy <i>Heroes</i> was built differently than everything that came before it. The Archers swapped instruments, building songs piece-by-piece rather than wrestling raw material into strange shapes. The results are looser, often quieter, more synthetic and more surreal than anything they'd done before. Bachmann, too, favors the falsetto on <i>White Trash Heroes</i>, his screams giving way to, well, not quite a whisper.</p>
<p>Whatever the Archers sought from <i>White Trash Heroes</i>-- a kind of rejuvenation through dismantling-- they didn't quite get. With its unorthodox instrumentation and downturn in the sheer viscerality behind their first three records, <i>White Trash Heroes</i> moves at a different pace than what came before it, a kind of slump-shouldered perturbation that, 15 years on, still feels a little scattered and somewhat less than ingratiating. The sound is less physical, more cerebral, practically an inversion of their early work. Yet the songs themselves often feel a bit centerless, too simple by half, or simply too strange for their own good. ""Slick Tricks"" bleeds Brainiac's ""Flypaper"" dry, but outlier among outliers ""I.N.S."" comes in just a few clicks below sludge metal, and ostensible centerpiece ""One Slight Wrong Move"" starts as a clanging nightmarescape and ends as a vocoder-addled choogler.</p>
<p>Some of it works-- the seven minute title track, with its rare flashes of optimism, is among their best-- and some of it doesn't, but there's really no denying that very little of it comes off as well as the kind of dug-in indie-rock these guys had mastered on their very first song. And when a hint of that early clarity like ""Perfect Time"" cuts through the fray, it sends many of <i>Heroes</i>' less successful experiments into sharp relief. ""Banging on a Dead Drum"" is a howler, but it's so buried in fuzz, so utterly plonked by that cowbell, it's everywhere and nowhere at once. Same with things like the instrumental ""Smokers in Love""; built around a jaunty riff worthy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"" target=""_blank"">Battles</a>, it's not quite a focus-tanking distraction, but it's not really a well-timed diversion, either. Large swaths of <i>Heroes</i> find the raw nerve they'd spent the past five years tapping sounding shot, their resolve starting to slip. ""Let's fall behind, in perfect time,"" Bachmann sings, and he seemed determined to do just that. Yet, for all its flaws, <i>Heroes</i> captivates. Over time, the coldness of the music eventually inches a few degrees northward, and when they reconcile the weirdness of the music with Bachmann's fraught observations, as on ""Dead Red Eyes"", it could be spellbinding.</p>
<p>Both albums' bonus discs are largely comprised of 4-track demos, with a couple of solid-to-great B-sides for good measure. It's illuminating, if not exactly essential; a particularly gnarly take on its title track aside, <i>All the Nations Airports</i> sounds, in demo form, just about how you'd expect. The songs do pack a little more punch without all the adornment, but their gnarly fidelity will make this a one-and-done deal for most. <i>White Trash Heroes</i>' extra disc fares better; led by the punchy, autumnal ""Jive Kata""-- among their finest non-LP sides-- you can hear the strange evolution of <i>Heroes</i>' unusual construction in its early stages. Stripped of all its (presumably ironic) flash, the desperation and directionlessness at the heart of the gaudy ""One Slight Wrong Move"" comes to the fore, turning a slightly depressing piss-take into a plea for escape. On the whole, this music feels unusually restless, spacious, the anxious energy of the past given way to wearinesss, a great band pulling themselves apart in real time.</p>
<p><i>White Trash Heroes</i> may not be the final Archers of Loaf album all that much longer.

To wit, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/"" target=""_blank"">Titus Andronicus</a> frontman Patrick Stickles used to perpetually call them the greatest band in the world. Some years ago, when a DJ friend who'd moved several states away returned to the Carolinas for a weekend, she learned that the Bags were performing at a nearby haunt and canceled all of her impending plans. In her mind, at least, the best local band ever-- the one with the shout-out-loud anthem called ""Waking Up Drunk"" and the frontman, Dan McGee, who sang about his demons with a conviction that made them the crowd's demons, too-- were playing, and she simply had to be there. And as colleague Marc Masters recently quipped online about the band's compulsive tunes, ""And now to listen to Spider Bags &amp; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29521-apache-dropout/"" target=""_blank"">Apache Dropout</a> constantly, even when I'm not listening to them."" As their name implies, when Spider Bags hook into you, it's hard to shake the hold.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The first two Spider Bags full-lengths depended on diversity. 2007's <i>A Celebration of Hunger</i> creeped through country turns that had more to do with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4456-townes-van-zandt/"" target=""_blank"">Townes Van Zandt</a> than whatever Little Steven plays on his show (""Lonely Man"" is the band's secret stunner) and occasionally climbed into the alt-country molds of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1183-drive-by-truckers/"" target=""_blank"">Drive-By Truckers</a>. The blistering rock'n'roll tracks were only part of the picture. They were more prominent on 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13650-goodbye-cruel-world-hello-crueler-world/"" target=""_blank""><i>Goodbye Cruel World, Hello Crueler World</i></a>, but there was still much more to be heard than fuzzy, frenzied barnstormers-- banjo songs, Crazy Horse-sized epics, sad-eyed duets and baby-please pleas.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Shake My Head</i>, the band's third album and their first for North Carolina imprint <a href=""http://www.odessarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Odessa Records</a>, is their most stylistically cohesive to date. Rolling through 10 tracks in less than 35 minutes, it delivers would-be rock hit after hit, shifting away from that template only for the record's closing third. That's not to say that <i>Shake My Head</i> is stylistically stripped at all; rather, those variations are woven into the charging songs rather than separated from them. ""Shawn Cripps Boogie"", for instance, is a xylophone-dotted instrumental played by a half-dozen guitarists, but its almost post-rock surge and otherwise playful countenance make it feel less like a departure or deviation than a great if wordless Spider Bags tune. With McGee's mix of don't-leave-me protestations and fuck-you-then imprecations, ""I'll Go Crazy"" is nothing if not a country song reworked for a rock band drunk on the idea of soul harmonies. ""Friday Night"" is surf music for the town's slouch, too wasted to go to the beach with his friends and too sad to go home with his memories. Spider Bags have finally fit all their interests and eccentricities into one tight, identifiable set. <i>Shake My Head</i> might not be their most surprising or inventive album to date, but it's certainly their most irrepressible, a record that seems suited and able to land its charms with a lot more people.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That's fitting, since <i>Shake My Head</i> is the product of a band at a curious crossroads in its own history: After two frustrating experiences with full-length release schedules and press cycles, McGee vowed to focus more on singles than albums. Spider Bags stuck to that, too, releasing a slew of unimpeachable 7""s but ultimately slowing the pace as an on-the-road, in-the-studio work force. Co-founder and bassist Gregg Levy headed back to New Jersey, committing to rejoin the band for tours while they recruited another bassist, Steve Oliva, to assume the role locally. When they headed west to Memphis to finally record <i>Shake My Head</i>, Levy flew down to split bass duties with Oliva. Perhaps in recognition of that strange lineup situation, Spider Bags used the Memphis sessions of <i>Shake My Head</i>-- and the long, guest-heavy overdub process that followed-- as an excuse to invite a horde of friends over to the studio and capture a party as they made a record. The jangling if jilted ""Simona La Ramona"" pairs fuzz bass from Memphis legend Jack Oblivian with the distant Theremin peal of Chapel Hill songwriter Billy Sugarfix, while opening blast ""Keys to the City"" hinges not only on multiple charging guitars but also backing vocals from, as the liner notes put it, ""The City of Memphis."" As you might expect, the space around these songs is often filled with laughter and false starts and chatter not necessarily intended for the microphone-- friends, hanging out, sharing the spirit of these songs and probably spirits, too. It's a sad-eyed celebration record. </p>
<p class=""p1"">That atmosphere fits McGee's songs. He is a writer, after all, who is best when extending empathy for the dispossessed, when he-- a married father at the helm of a great rock band-- writes about and for those who don't have it so good. Sure, there's nonsense written into these lyrics, too, but McGee's perfectly able to express misery in an economical phrase or two. ""I'm a dog, baby, without an owner,"" he sings on ""Simona La Ramona"", bouncing into the rhyme with hope for the future. ""I can't keep a phone/ And I can barely pay rent/ And the car I own/ I only really own the dents,"" he offers during the brilliant ""Shape I Was In"", a breezy, organ-backed tune that seems to treat despair like a necessity of life, not a reason for exasperation. Above sizzling guitar lines, boogie-woogie keys, and flickering tambourine, ""Standing on a Curb"" opens with what might seem to be a dismissive image of McGee ""waiting on some girl."" But as the song unfolds, we learn that the person he's waiting on doesn't matter as much as the general feeling of being specifically sad about loving someone who could care less what curb you're standing on, or if you're able to stand at all. The anxiety overruns any ambition he's ever had. ""I don't have anything else to do,"" McGee admits. ""I'm looking at a picture of you."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">And then, of course, he beats the shit out of the photo. Hell, what else could he have done? And what else could you do, besides commiserate with and sing along to a record that turns problems into a party you'll wish you had attended.</p></div>"|16910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16910-shake-my-head/|8.1|Grayson Currin

All of which means that listening to a song by the peppy piano-pop Brooklyn trio feels a little bit like stumbling unexpectedly into a Broadway musical (let's say <i>Movin' Out</i>; singer Ben Thornewill sings like a man who owns a Billy Joel record or two) at that precise moment when everyone breaks into song. If you're the sort of person who can suspend the necessary cynicism when this happens in the movies, then maybe you'll go for their brand of hyperactively hooky power-pop. But if you have ever wondered such apt questions as, ""How do these people know all the words?"" or ""When did they find the time to practice these dances steps?"" and ""Why wasn't I invited to the practices?"" you are probably the sort of person who should steer clear of their latest record, <i>Safe Travels</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Drawing inspiration from piano-driven singer-songwriters (Thornewill cites Harry Nilsson as inspiration for the sparse closer ""The Spiritual""), synth-tinged power ballads, and blue-eyed soul, Jukebox the Ghost occupy a niche carved out by the continued cult success of Ben Folds' solo career, though they lack his goofball wit. Bite and humor (and some other qualities that would earn the Nilsson comparison) aren't exactly in their wheelhouse, and instead the tone of their music has only one setting: excessive earnestness. See, for example, ""Oh Emily"", which is probably the most maddeningly passive-aggressive break-up song you'll hear this year. ""Oh, Emily, you're a funny girl, and I didn't mean to break your heart,"" guitarist Tommy Siegel sings with an apologetic shrug over a rosy glow of synths. ""But I'm lost in love with everyone."" That is, of course, a cloyingly euphemistic way of explaining how you fucked up, and the overall sound of <i>Safe Travels</i> suffers from the same problem: It's paralyzingly afraid to offend.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Safe Travels</i> tackles themes of mortality and maturity (I know this because there's a song called ""Adulthood""), especially during its ballad-heavy middle section. Like the gospel influenced ""The Spiritual"", ""Adulthood"" is actually a highlight. It's about the death of Thornewill's grandfather from lung cancer (""In my lungs I still feel young/ But my body won't play along""), and it benefits from a specificity of feeling. The similarly thuddingly titled slow-burner ""Dead"", on the other hand, relies too heavily on vagueness, cliches, and dorm room stoner philosophy to be genuinely moving. ""And if you're dead,"" Siegel wonders at one point, ""How do you know if you're really dead?""</p>
<p class=""p1"">And, well, let him wonder. Maybe this is an aptly deep thought for Jukebox's target demographic, which is probably not going anywhere: As long as there are college freshmen who think Passion Pit are ""too weird,"" people who prefer the ""Glee Version"" to the original and ABC TV producers looking to do segments about <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/video/amplified-jukebox-ghost-11574483"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hip indie bands in Brooklyn</a>, there will be an audience for bands like Jukebox the Ghost, who at least do this unoffensive brand of power-pap serviceably. But if you’re too much of a realist to believe in trick lighting, happy endings or choreographed emotion, <i>Safe Travels</i> will probably leave you wishing for riskier terrain.</p></div>"|16709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16709-safe-travels/|4.6|Lindsay Zoladz

Renewed interest in the label is partially due to a new generation of bands (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5753-crystal-stilts/"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Stilts</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28156-veronica-falls/"" target=""_blank"">Veronica Falls</a>) that have put out solid records on the California-by-way-of-D.C. imprint; it's also been kindled by reunion shows like Slumberland's 20th anniversary concerts and this year's <a href=""http://chickfactor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chickfactor 20</a> gigs.</p>
<p>But even in the midst of all this nostalgia and revisiting, certain gems of the label's back catalog remain unplundered. One such record is 1995's <i>Everyone Must Touch the Stove</i>, which up until now was the sole LP from Washington, D.C.-area trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30526-lorelei/"" target=""_blank"">Lorelei</a>. It remains overlooked because it doesn't quite fit the narrative: In most corners, ""Slumberland"" is still considered a synonym for ""dreamy"" or even ""twee,"" but the immersive <i>Stove</i> is full of creeping, diffuse post-rock nightmares. Still, the fact that Lorelei haven't been one of the touchstones of the label's revival and continued influence shouldn't come as much of a surprise: they were misunderstood in their (very brief) heyday, too. In a 2009 <a href=""http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/interviews/byt-interview-lorelei/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, guitarist/singer Matt Dingee recalled something that happened when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4564-the-wedding-present/"" target=""_blank"">the Wedding Present</a>'s David Gedge, a demigod of the early-90s indie pop circle, caught a Lorelei show. After their set, Gedge said to him, ""I like your guitar sounds and everything, but for me it's about writing songs.""</p>
<p>Patient listeners will certainly echo Dingee's response: ""But we have songs."" Though their local compatriots included D.C. contemporaries and labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/380-black-tambourine/"" target=""_blank"">Black Tambourine</a>, Whorl, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2486-lilys/"" target=""_blank"">Lilys</a>, an appreciation of Lorelei demanded slightly different ears. A shoegaze influence is the common denominator in all these bands, but Lorelei were more interested in creating detailed post-rock textures than melodic pop hooks. Drummer Davis White and bassist Stephen Gardner erect steady yet fluid supports for Dingee's distorted reveries, in which elements of emo, jazz, and math rock occasionally bubble up. There are moments on <i>Stove</i>, like ""Throwaway"", that recall the kind of magic that post-rock sorcerers Disco Inferno were conjuring around this time across the pond: Dingee's guitars melt, morph into sirens, and blend with muffled voices picked up via radio frequencies. Which is another way that Lorelei went against the grain. A lot of DIY bands were interested in stripping their songs down to their most minimal elements and letting the seams show. Lorelei did just the opposite: they were three ordinary dudes casting large shadows and projecting epic illusions. Listening to <i>Stove</i> and their sprawling <i>Asleep</i> EP, it's still hard to believe that there were only three people in the band.</p>
<p>Lorelei dissolved and reformed under equally ordinary circumstances. In the mid 90s, Dingee moved to California, and a couple of years ago he moved back to the D.C. area; the band got back together just in time for the Slumberland 20th anniversary shows in 2009. Now, almost two decades after their debut full-length, comes their second LP, <i>Enterprising Sidewalks</i> (most apt song title: ""Sorry For the Patience""), on which Lorelei's sound is as challenging, immersive and adventurous as ever.</p>
<p>The years have cooled off some of their emo leanings, as they must. Compare the surreal, off-kilter romanticism of <i>Stove</i> songs like ""Newsprint"" and ""Windmill"" (""She smiled as he placed his warm hands on her apple cheeks/ He places his foot in the corner of her mouth"") with Dingee's dry, mock-bureaucratic delivery on ""Outside Through the Keyhole"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13775-hammer-meets-tongs/"" target=""_blank"">""Hammer Meets Tongs""</a> (""What we need's a better management plan/ And an enterprising sidewalk""). But in the moments when Dingee's vocals feel too monotone, his strings pick up the slack-- as ever, his guitar playing is far and away the most expressive element of Lorelei's music. ""Majority Stakes"" crescendos with soaring, steely noise that transforms into aqueous arpeggios, while the expansive ""Three Interlocking Screens"" gives the band space to experiment with all sorts of textures and tones. The tighter pop numbers are there too (""Wound Up"", ""Sorry For the Patience""), but as ever Lorelei are at their best when they take the time to unfurl their more impressionistic ideas.</p>
<p>""We all have sharp ideas, hear another and I'm bored to tears,"" Dingee drones on the album's most biting track, ""Let Go of Our Ego"". Though it doesn't direct its malice towards anything or anyone in particular, it could perhaps serve as a commentary on a few cultural concepts that have cropped up since Lorelei last put out a record: reality TV, ""indie fame,"" or internet-fueled overshares. The chorus certainly feels like a retaliation against that last one: ""I've got nothing to say today, to you or anyone you know."" But as fittingly unceremonious and ego-free a record it is, <i>Enterprising Sidewalks</i> proves that that statement isn't so. Even if it doesn't quite match the heights of <i>Everyone Must Touch the Stove</i>, <i>Enterprising Sidewalks</i> gestures towards the more obscure corners of the band's (and the label's) back catalog, showing the next generation of Slumberland fans that the vault holds more than just sweet dreams.</p></div>"|17010.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17010-enterprising-sidewalks/|6.8|Lindsay Zoladz

<p>This box set of remasters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45230-roxy-music-to-release-career-spanning-box-set/"" target=""_blank"">to celebrate the band's 40th anniversary</a>-- not lavish, but thorough and reasonably priced-- is an opportunity to break free of narrative and see what sets every phase of Roxy Music apart. The answer is Bryan Ferry, one of rock's great, sustained acts of self-definition. In classic 70s style, like Bowie or Bolan, Ferry invented a pop star. A sybarite with a plummy, awkward croon, gliding through his own songs like they were parties he'd forgotten arriving at. A flying Dutchman of the jet set, doomed to find love but never satisfaction. Having worked his way into character over an album or two, he simply never left it, becoming more Bryan Ferry with every record and every year, whether performing or not.</p>
<p>Which might have been insufferable, except Ferry's performances could hit an emotional core nobody else in rock was getting near. He made enervation his own-- a real, neglected feeling, if a hard one to sympathise with. On <i>Avalon's</i> title track he puts it plainly: ""Now the party's over/ I'm so tired"". Roxy were never drained by hangovers or comedowns, more by moments of rueful self-knowledge. But you hardly needed lyrics to spot it: from first to last, Roxy Music scattered moments of exquisite exhaustion through their songs. The hanging chords on the intro to early single ""Pyjamarama"", as if the song can't decide whether to get out of bed. The smothering synthesised pall of ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache"", from their masterpiece, 1973's <i>For Your Pleasure</i>. The hilariously overwrought dolour of ""A Song For Europe"". Or the band rousing themselves on ""Just Another High"" for a quixotic chase after one last thrill, futility nipping at their heels.</p>
<p>That song, closing out 1975's <i>Siren</i>, was one of the great career-ending statements. Except Roxy reformed and returned-- a three year break counted as a split in the frenzied 70s-- for a trio of albums that explored ennui in ever smoother, prettier, and more laconic ways. They restarted well. The glowering, compelling title track from 1979's <i>Manifesto </i>promises a meaner and darker band than we ever quite got. But the later material isn't always worthwhile. There are moments on 1980's <i>Flesh and Blood</i>, in particular, where the band stop sounding tired and start sounding bored, a fatal difference. There are also moments, like <i>Avalon</i>'s ""More Than This"" and ""To Turn You On"", where the entropic gloss is a feint to let heartbreaking loneliness get in close and floor you. The ultimate late Roxy Music song, oddly, might be their cover of ""Jealous Guy"", released after John Lennon's murder. Here genuine loss is paid tribute by studied melancholy, soul-baring replaced by poised regret, and in the greatest tribute a narcissist could pay the song stands revealed as a Roxy tune all along.</p>
<p>Exhaustion was Roxy Music's speciality, but if it was all they could do they'd be a footnote. The band earn their ennui by convincing us how hard they can party. The superb mid-70s albums in particular-- <i>For Your Pleasure</i>, <i>Stranded</i>, <i>Country Life</i> and <i>Siren</i>-- are giddy, muscular displays, and vicious when they need to be. They're also Ferry's peak as a vocalist: by <i>Stranded </i>(also from '73) he'd found his voice but hadn't settled into the lounge lizard comfort zone, and was confident playing things staccato, mocking or sentimental. More importantly, his band had the same freedom to roam. If they lack the impertinent invention of the Eno years, these records are generous with opportunities for Roxy Music's lynchpins-- Phil Manzanera, Andy Mackay and Eddie Jobson-- to shine and stretch. When they reach full steam behind an inspired Ferry, on ""The Thrill of It All"", ""Street Life"" or ""Mother of Pearl"", it's the best, most exciting music the band created.</p>
<p>Eno's departure, as he himself admitted, helped Roxy become that more focused, energized band. But his contributions had been colossal. Eno helped Ferry mutate his songs into referential collages and eerie synthscapes, and that experimentation gave the early Roxy their identity. He's easier to spot on their flashy, daring self-titled 1972 debut, the inventiveness of songs like ""Ladytron"" and ""The Bob (Medley)"" helping cover up rattly production. But <i>For Your Pleasure</i> is a greater testament to Eno's importance: it's hard to imagine an album that better exploits the tension between two fast-diverging creativities. Its best tracks play games with sincerity and emotional tone: the preposterous schmaltz of ""Beauty Queen"" resolving into real anguish, while ""In Every Dream Home an Heartache"" lurches from creepiness to hilarity. Speculating on what would have happened if Eno had stayed with Roxy Music past two albums is wistful fun. But once you've squeezed nine-minute krautrock jam ""The Bogus Man"" and light-footed pop manifesto ""Do the Strand"" into the same space, and made it work so magnificently, where do you go? Besides, Ferry needed room to obsessively refine himself.</p>
<p>What they lost, over time, wasn't so much inventiveness as playfulness. <i>Country Life</i> (1974), in particular, is an album of delightful variety-- the genre pastiche of ""Prairie Rose"", the gothic folly of ""Tryptych"", the gentle reflection of ""Three and Nine"". None of these survived the three-year gap. The box set has two discs of non-album material-- singles, mixes and edits-- including all the instrumentals they put on B-Sides. Relaxed studio goof-offs (""Hula Kula"", ""Your Application's Failed"") give way to portentousness (""South Downs"") as Ferry, or the group, evolve, and it's a shame. There were trade-offs, of course. The final records may not be so much fun but Ferry had found an occasional knack of crafting brilliant, swooning radio choruses-- ""Dance Away"", ""Oh Yeah"", and ""More Than This"" fully deserve their thrones in AOR Valhalla.</p>
<p>Direct Roxy Music copyists are few, but their themes-- romantic gloom, and the weariness of hedonism-- will be pop-relevant as long as self-conscious twentysomethings get famous, or want to. The music on this box set is often startling, usually wonderful and more affecting that you might have expected. But it's also fascinating as the story of a gradual hardening of an elegant, enigmatic persona, Bryan Ferry's transformation from art-school pop star to self-made sphinx.</p></div>"|16810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16810-roxy-music-the-complete-studio-recordings-1972-1982/|9.5|Tom Ewing

But <i>For Your Pleasure</i> is a greater testament to Eno's importance: it's hard to imagine an album that better exploits the tension between two fast-diverging creativities. Its best tracks play games with sincerity and emotional tone: the preposterous schmaltz of ""Beauty Queen"" resolving into real anguish, while ""In Every Dream Home an Heartache"" lurches from creepiness to hilarity. Speculating on what would have happened if Eno had stayed with Roxy Music past two albums is wistful fun.

<p>What they lost, over time, wasn't so much inventiveness as playfulness. <i>Country Life</i> (1974), in particular, is an album of delightful variety-- the genre pastiche of ""Prairie Rose"", the gothic folly of ""Tryptych"", the gentle reflection of ""Three and Nine"". None of these survived the three-year gap. The box set has two discs of non-album material-- singles, mixes and edits-- including all the instrumentals they put on B-Sides. Relaxed studio goof-offs (""Hula Kula"", ""Your Application's Failed"") give way to portentousness (""South Downs"") as Ferry, or the group, evolve, and it's a shame.

<p>Direct Roxy Music copyists are few, but their themes-- romantic gloom, and the weariness of hedonism-- will be pop-relevant as long as self-conscious twentysomethings get famous, or want to.

The answer is Bryan Ferry, one of rock's great, sustained acts of self-definition. In classic 70s style, like Bowie or Bolan, Ferry invented a pop star. A sybarite with a plummy, awkward croon, gliding through his own songs like they were parties he'd forgotten arriving at. A flying Dutchman of the jet set, doomed to find love but never satisfaction.

<p>Which might have been insufferable, except Ferry's performances could hit an emotional core nobody else in rock was getting near. He made enervation his own-- a real, neglected feeling, if a hard one to sympathise with. On <i>Avalon's</i> title track he puts it plainly: ""Now the party's over/ I'm so tired"". Roxy were never drained by hangovers or comedowns, more by moments of rueful self-knowledge. But you hardly needed lyrics to spot it: from first to last, Roxy Music scattered moments of exquisite exhaustion through their songs. The hanging chords on the intro to early single ""Pyjamarama"", as if the song can't decide whether to get out of bed. The smothering synthesised pall of ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache"", from their masterpiece, 1973's <i>For Your Pleasure</i>. The hilariously overwrought dolour of ""A Song For Europe"".

<p>This box set of remasters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45230-roxy-music-to-release-career-spanning-box-set/"" target=""_blank"">to celebrate the band's 40th anniversary</a>-- not lavish, but thorough and reasonably priced-- is an opportunity to break free of narrative and see what sets every phase of Roxy Music apart. The answer is Bryan Ferry, one of rock's great, sustained acts of self-definition. In classic 70s style, like Bowie or Bolan, Ferry invented a pop star. A sybarite with a plummy, awkward croon, gliding through his own songs like they were parties he'd forgotten arriving at. A flying Dutchman of the jet set, doomed to find love but never satisfaction. Having worked his way into character over an album or two, he simply never left it, becoming more Bryan Ferry with every record and every year, whether performing or not.</p>
<p>Which might have been insufferable, except Ferry's performances could hit an emotional core nobody else in rock was getting near. He made enervation his own-- a real, neglected feeling, if a hard one to sympathise with. On <i>Avalon's</i> title track he puts it plainly: ""Now the party's over/ I'm so tired"". Roxy were never drained by hangovers or comedowns, more by moments of rueful self-knowledge. But you hardly needed lyrics to spot it: from first to last, Roxy Music scattered moments of exquisite exhaustion through their songs. The hanging chords on the intro to early single ""Pyjamarama"", as if the song can't decide whether to get out of bed. The smothering synthesised pall of ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache"", from their masterpiece, 1973's <i>For Your Pleasure</i>. The hilariously overwrought dolour of ""A Song For Europe"". Or the band rousing themselves on ""Just Another High"" for a quixotic chase after one last thrill, futility nipping at their heels.</p>
<p>That song, closing out 1975's <i>Siren</i>, was one of the great career-ending statements. Except Roxy reformed and returned-- a three year break counted as a split in the frenzied 70s-- for a trio of albums that explored ennui in ever smoother, prettier, and more laconic ways. They restarted well. The glowering, compelling title track from 1979's <i>Manifesto </i>promises a meaner and darker band than we ever quite got. But the later material isn't always worthwhile. There are moments on 1980's <i>Flesh and Blood</i>, in particular, where the band stop sounding tired and start sounding bored, a fatal difference. There are also moments, like <i>Avalon</i>'s ""More Than This"" and ""To Turn You On"", where the entropic gloss is a feint to let heartbreaking loneliness get in close and floor you. The ultimate late Roxy Music song, oddly, might be their cover of ""Jealous Guy"", released after John Lennon's murder. Here genuine loss is paid tribute by studied melancholy, soul-baring replaced by poised regret, and in the greatest tribute a narcissist could pay the song stands revealed as a Roxy tune all along.</p>
<p>Exhaustion was Roxy Music's speciality, but if it was all they could do they'd be a footnote. The band earn their ennui by convincing us how hard they can party. The superb mid-70s albums in particular-- <i>For Your Pleasure</i>, <i>Stranded</i>, <i>Country Life</i> and <i>Siren</i>-- are giddy, muscular displays, and vicious when they need to be. They're also Ferry's peak as a vocalist: by <i>Stranded </i>(also from '73) he'd found his voice but hadn't settled into the lounge lizard comfort zone, and was confident playing things staccato, mocking or sentimental. More importantly, his band had the same freedom to roam. If they lack the impertinent invention of the Eno years, these records are generous with opportunities for Roxy Music's lynchpins-- Phil Manzanera, Andy Mackay and Eddie Jobson-- to shine and stretch. When they reach full steam behind an inspired Ferry, on ""The Thrill of It All"", ""Street Life"" or ""Mother of Pearl"", it's the best, most exciting music the band created.</p>
<p>Eno's departure, as he himself admitted, helped Roxy become that more focused, energized band. But his contributions had been colossal. Eno helped Ferry mutate his songs into referential collages and eerie synthscapes, and that experimentation gave the early Roxy their identity. He's easier to spot on their flashy, daring self-titled 1972 debut, the inventiveness of songs like ""Ladytron"" and ""The Bob (Medley)"" helping cover up rattly production. But <i>For Your Pleasure</i> is a greater testament to Eno's importance: it's hard to imagine an album that better exploits the tension between two fast-diverging creativities. Its best tracks play games with sincerity and emotional tone: the preposterous schmaltz of ""Beauty Queen"" resolving into real anguish, while ""In Every Dream Home an Heartache"" lurches from creepiness to hilarity. Speculating on what would have happened if Eno had stayed with Roxy Music past two albums is wistful fun. But once you've squeezed nine-minute krautrock jam ""The Bogus Man"" and light-footed pop manifesto ""Do the Strand"" into the same space, and made it work so magnificently, where do you go? Besides, Ferry needed room to obsessively refine himself.</p>
<p>What they lost, over time, wasn't so much inventiveness as playfulness. <i>Country Life</i> (1974), in particular, is an album of delightful variety-- the genre pastiche of ""Prairie Rose"", the gothic folly of ""Tryptych"", the gentle reflection of ""Three and Nine"". None of these survived the three-year gap. The box set has two discs of non-album material-- singles, mixes and edits-- including all the instrumentals they put on B-Sides. Relaxed studio goof-offs (""Hula Kula"", ""Your Application's Failed"") give way to portentousness (""South Downs"") as Ferry, or the group, evolve, and it's a shame. There were trade-offs, of course. The final records may not be so much fun but Ferry had found an occasional knack of crafting brilliant, swooning radio choruses-- ""Dance Away"", ""Oh Yeah"", and ""More Than This"" fully deserve their thrones in AOR Valhalla.</p>
<p>Direct Roxy Music copyists are few, but their themes-- romantic gloom, and the weariness of hedonism-- will be pop-relevant as long as self-conscious twentysomethings get famous, or want to. The music on this box set is often startling, usually wonderful and more affecting that you might have expected.

Since the 1970s, she's fronted numerous groups, some of which had brief flirtations with commercial success: Philadelphia funk outfit Fun City, new wave also-rans the Vels, or the Roadrunner-inked grunge act Die Monster Die. Cohen is almost certainly the only artist to have been on the same labels as Nickelback and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>.</p>
<p>And yet, while <i>Pink Keys</i> sounds like a perfect fit within OESB's body of sci-fi synth pop, Cohen's considerable history doesn't form a part of any greater narrative for the label. It's simply a hooky, immersive, and occasionally goofy record of people sounding like computers and computers making imperfect sounds-- the chewy basslines, Linn drum machines, and marshmallow synth tones certainly qualify it as ""retro,"" but it's hard to imagine a time when it could have sounded futuristic. ""Dead Leaves in Milk Glass"" takes its title as sonic inspiration, brittle acoustic guitars and a miniaturized synth run suggesting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"" target=""_blank"">Nite Jewel</a>'s recent forays into merging coffee shop balladry with a kosmische fetish, but with stronger melodic presence. Elsewhere, <i>Pink Keys</i> situates itself in a middle class of 1980s electronic pop: Typically we hear bands recall the absurdly expensive studio creations of the time (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28599-twin-shadow/"" target=""_blank"">Twin Shadow</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30419-ice-choir/"" target=""_blank"">Ice Choir</a>) or go to the opposite end and embrace the crudest technology possible (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28699-the-soft-moon/"" target=""_blank"">the Soft Moon</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30172-black-marble/"" target=""_blank"">Black Marble</a>). The songs on <i>Pink Keys</i> are built with impressive machinery, but the kind that risk failure. On something like ""La Fete Etrange"", what could easily pass for pompous hair-metal licks get turned into blunt synth blurts, charming with minor malfunctions. There's a slight awkwardness to the purple funk of ""Silent Movie"" where the synths don't bounce quite right, but it nonetheless finds its own groove.</p>
<p><i>Pink Keys</i> possesses not so much with a personality as it does a presence. Cohen stacks and refracts her nasal, youthful vocal lines, which tumble over each other and harmonize imperfectly. Beyond her contributions, the album is a community affair, enlisting the help of mixer Chris Moore, percussionist Thor Harris, and lo-fi R&amp;B recluse <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29170-autre-ne-veut/"" target=""_blank"">Autre Ne Veut</a>. As trivial as these connections might initially seem, Cohen stands to benefit from any sort of grounding. <i>Pink Keys</i> occasionally lapses into the kind of crystal visions that make perfect sense solely to the people who come up with them-- witness the hook during the cosmic honky-tonker ""Mauve Mood"": ""Too much static on the astral phone in a mauve mood and a lilac zone."" There is also a song called ""Salamander's Tale"", which at least has a title that gives you fair warning of what to expect from it. I think Cohen gets it, though. On ""La Fete Etrange"", she sings, ""I'd like to walk around in your world, but I can't live it for you,"" and while it's just a little nonsensical, it's something of an M.O. for <i>Pink Keys</i>-- to create your own personal world, and acknowledge the risk that its rules might not make sense to everyone.</p></div>"|17053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17053-pink-keys/|7.0|Ian Cohen

Their audience has not grown in size since their 2004 major-label debut album sold over 300,000 copies. It has in fact shrunk considerably, so much so that the group's two albums since then-- 2010's <i>The Other Side</i> and now <i>Nicole and Natalie</i>-- have been self-released. But as their audience has boiled down, Nina Sky have gained the freedom to experiment, to chase their slippery notions of pop music around the globe. In doing so, they threw themselves into strands of pop-- dancehall, reggaeton, R&amp;B, UK bass-- that have long interacted with each other. There were various delays and abruptions along the way (especially with their aborted 2007 album <i>Starting Today</i>), but the duo could teach a class on how sustain the integrity of your art after being dropped by a major label.</p>
<p><i>Nicole and Natalie</i> finds Nina Sky dabbling in radio-ready Europop. It turns out that, too, suits them just fine. The album wedges a midpoint in between the headrush dance-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"" target=""_blank"">Robyn</a>, honorary European Kylie Minogue and the brooding, dance-inflected R&amp;B of someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30349-dawn-richard/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Richard</a>. The album's shortcomings aren't rooted in anything aesthetic, but simple math: At eight songs, Nina Sky needed to hit just about every single one out of the park. Unfortunately, their aim isn't always true.</p>
<p>Saccharine ballad ""Starting Today"" opens the album in a bizarre place-- it almost feels as if the tracklist was accidentally flipped. Worse, though, is the song itself. It's meant as an empowering break-up kiss-off, but the sentiment is sorely underwritten. It instead comes off like a failed early-00s graduation tear-jerker. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13953-comatose/"" target=""_blank"">""Comatose""</a> (""Let's keep going till we're comatose"") is similarly thin-- its twinkling, weightless beat is a waste of progressive Brooklyn producer Brenmar, and neither sister has the voice to carry the song. The same can be said for ""Never Kissed You"", another downtempo track that just drags along. The beat, produced by R&amp;B veteran Salaam Remi, slows down a liberal sample of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7812-esg/"" target=""_blank"">ESG</a>'s ""UFO"", cutting an odd figure at the heart of the album.</p>
<p>The highs, though, are impressively high. ""Day Dreaming"" is the slow jam on the album that really works-- with its aqueous keyboard melody and clattering drums that eventually give way to beatboxing, it evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland</a> collaborating with Jim Jonsin (and actually producing a good song). ""Heartbeat"" is the big tension-release house tune that makes you imagine a world where Nina Sky still had an open avenue to the radio. Contrary to much of the house-indebted pop with a stranglehold over the airwaves right now, there's no cynical or mechanical enthusiasm in ""Heartbeat"", which breaks itself down before achieving genuine emotional lift-off as the chorus kicks in. ""Everytime"" and especially ""Bright Lights"" are in the same boat: expertly written and produced chart fare with little chance of impacting on a wide level. So it goes.</p>
<p>This album may contain the most divisive music that Nina Sky have ever put out. It is, probably by a good margin, the least cool route they've ever taken. But it showcases, above all, the curiosity and adaptability of Nicole and Natalie Albino. Plus, fans of the duo that may be split on this direction can at least find common ground on one unalienable fact: Nina Sky will be on some other shit soon.</p></div>"|17051.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17051-nicole-natalie/|6.4|Jordan Sargent

Witness, for instance, what happens around the halfway mark on south-west London DJ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22672-oneman/"" target=""_blank"">Oneman</a>'s nearly 70-minute blast for Glasgow label-of-the-moment <a href=""http://thisisluckyme.com/mixtapes/93-oneman-ninety-three-mixtape/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LuckyMe's mix series</a> last year, when the immortal rush of Prince's ""I Would Die 4 U"" hits the speakers. An expertly selected smattering of bass and dance precedes the refreshingly not-so-deep cut, so the immediate familiarity of a selection so tied to a monoculture feels jarring for anyone not sitting in front of a tracklist. Then, the Purple One's proclamations lead into a different kind of Purple-- specifically, of the Bristol kind, as the tart synths of ""She Wore Velour"", a highlight from the <a href=""http://nightslugs.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Night Slugs</a>-released, sole EP by Bristol boys <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29058-hyetal/"" target=""_blank"">Hyetal</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29346-julio-bashmore/"" target=""_blank"">Julio Bashmore</a>'s Velour project, <i>The Velvet Collection</i>, luxuriously unspool atop a jet-black surface. It's an inspired match-up, as well as a pretty good audio-chromatic joke (even if Bashmore's been leaning more towards proper house and pop these days).</p>
<p>The willingness to extend beyond beat-matching and showing off a personal bounty of unreleased dubplates, to create a narrative and mine unexpected sources, is precisely what's earned Oneman, aka Steve Bishop, the ""DJ's DJ"" tag from those in the know. His <a href=""http://that502shit.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">502 Recordings</a> label (which put out a short run of unbeatable singles in 2011 and more or less hasn't been heard from since) deals primarily with bass music, and the last few years have seen his name rise within the community as an expert spinner. So the opening cut of Bishop's Fabriclive mix, the 64th in the famed London club's ongoing series, is a mighty clever selection, as the thickness of Mark Pritchard's ""?"", carrying a brown sound-worthy low end, cuts an imposing figure (try it at any volume and avoid feeling disoriented-- I dare you). The proclamation is hard to miss: <i>You want the bass? Have at it.</i></p>
<p>Of course, mere wit isn't enough-- especially when concerning the visceral pleasures of dance music-- so <i>Fabriclive 64</i> proceeds to dispel such arch notions, as Bishop stretches his legs and dazzles by weaving cut after choice cut seamlessly. The writeup that accompanies the LuckyMe mix refers to his mixing style as ""techno-tight,"" and indeed what's on display here is nearly seamless, an hour of perfectly stitched-together body music that's so airtight that when the beat drops ever so briefly, on the VIP mix of Grievous Angel's rowdy ""Move Down Low"", I still check my iTunes to make sure it didn't freeze. The overall mood varies from hard-hitting to spacious to enormously elegant, but there's seldom a place to wander, a point where you're anything less than in-the-moment. The steady energy means that you're there, you're captivated, and you're locked.</p>
<p>Possibly the most exciting aspect of <i>Fabriclive 64</i> is how it functions as a fascinating survey of what's been taking place in the ever-mutating UK bass scene over the past few years. It's not comprehensive (with the ever-changing face of bass, how could it be?) but its selection of sonic permutations-- the colorful swarm of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28873-sbtrkt/"" target=""_blank"">SBTRKT</a>, MikeQ's heavy-hitting ballroom fire, Night Slugs co-head Bok Bok's house-infused work with Dutch producer and Rush Hour affiliate Tom Trago-- more than communicate the scene's constantly shifting eccentricities. Referring to <i>Fabriclive 64</i> as a snapshot, though, would be doing a disservice to Bishop's expressive blend of past and present, as the dusty UK Garage of Dem 2 and Steve Gurley's gorgeous 2-step rework of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/300-basement-jaxx/"" target=""_blank"">Basement Jaxx</a>'s ""Red Alert"" (easily the mix's most surprising source of elation) fit perfectly alongside more current fare. So there's history here, represented both distantly and in the type that's been made before the eyes and ears of those who have been watching over the last few years.</p>
<p>Applauding <i>Fabriclive 64</i> for its potential didacticism, though, would be unjustly ignoring just how much fun it is to listen to, how easily and pleasantly it moves, how Steve Bishop is playing to the rafters and pulling out all the stops when his name alone represents a seal of approval for many. An ironic occurrence regarding the meteoric rise of what the mainstream media calls ""EDM"" is that the massive popularity accompanied by the boom has only caused folks to draw deeper lines in the sand. <i>Here's my music, the </i>real<i> kind, enjoy whatever it is you're listening to.</i> <i>That isn't what you're calling it-- </i>this<i> is more like what you're referencing, and you probably wouldn't get it, anyway.</i> This snobbery has existed in the dance community for eons (and its gatekeeping fires have been stoked by the wonders of the internet, naturally), but it seems especially dangerous-- and, it must be said, staunchly classist-- in recent times. I'd like to think that <i>anyone</i> would like <i>Fabriclive 64</i>. Not because they'll learn something, or because it's impeccably hip. Simply, rather, because it's good music, and it doesn't take a genius to see the value in that.</p></div>"|17013.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17013-fabriclive-64/|8.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

He'd been one of the primary performers in the revival and fusioning of bubu music, an ancient folk form that had survived the 18th-century introduction of Islam to the country. At a time when the Sierra Leonean music scene was dominated by imported forms, and especially reggae, the old bubu rhythms injected an energizing shot of local flavor into pop music. For a time, Nabay used to his music to speak out against the country's spiraling civil war, but when rebels co-opted his music during their destructive drives into rural villages, he found himself with few options but to leave.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In the United States, he searched for collaborators while working as a fry cook, and found them not in the Sierra Leonean ex-pat community, but in Brooklyn's indie rock scene. The Bubu Gang, Nabay's backing band on <i>En Yay Sah</i>, comprises members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4068-skeletons/"" target=""_blank"">Skeletons</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift/"" target=""_blank"">Chairlift</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27967-highlife/"" target=""_blank"">Highlife</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28636-saadi/"" target=""_blank"">Saadi</a>, and their method of collaboration was simple: Nabay showed them the rhythms he was working with and the songs he'd written, and he turned them loose. Jon Leland's drums hold down the heavily syncopated bubu beats, the music's strongest tie to tradition, and the rest of the band cooks up a backing for Nabay that sounds so intensely modern it's practically futuristic. Guitarist Doug Shaw plays no rhythm, instead adding color to the music with mildly psychedelic leads that focus on melody when Nabay isn't singing and recede to tonal washes during the verses.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Nabay's weathered but agile voice is the kind of instrument that would likely sound at home on a sparse field recording, so it's curious how well it integrates with Jason McMahon's sleek-toned bass and Michael Gallope's bright, tropical keyboard sounds. The integration is helped by the backing vocals of Syrian-born Boshra AlSaadi, who sings answering phrases to Nabay's leads and functions essentially as part of the rhythm section. Her repeated vocal line on ""Ro Lungi"" becomes the song's primary hook, complementing and reinforcing the keyboard phrase that serves as the other hook and gives shape to Nabay's rapid-fire lead vocals.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Nabay sings in four languages on the record: his native Temne, a syncretic combination of English and African languages that originated in Western Hemisphere slave communities called Krio, and small amounts of English and Arabic. It reflects his country's complicated history, as well as his own emergence into a wider world from his homeland's small music scene. Bubu music is ancient; <i>En Yay Sah</i> offers a powerfully modern, cosmopolitan introduction to its complex and vibrant rhythms.</p></div>"|16911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16911-en-yay-sah/|7.3|Joe Tangari

Not the current one of Bon Iver or Grimes, but the one of Bauhaus, This Mortal Coil, and the Cocteau Twins-- 1980s art goth of a particular kind. But neither label nor their bands sought that tag. And since Dead Can Dance's music incorporated sounds from around the globe and across the centuries, the description seems particularly limiting. <i>Anastasis</i>, the duo's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8903-dead-can-dance/"" target=""_blank"">first new album together in 16 years</a> (following a variety of solo works and collaborations as well as a retrospective 2005 tour), finds Dead Can Dance firmly in their comfort zone, at a time when neither Gerrard nor Perry should feel they have anything left to prove. </p>
<p>Dead Can Dance always avoided a curatorial or purist approach to global music, and that trend continues here. They're as open to new technologies and recording possibilities as they are to ancient instruments like the yangqin and the bodhrán, but they also eschew the collision of samples and beats that often defines other experimenters in the field. But over time, the influence of Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard has reached far and wide. From <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25192-the-future-sound-of-london/"">Future Sound of London</a>'s early techno landmark ""Papua New Guinea"", which samples Gerrard's voice, to cover versions by bands such as arty metal types the Gathering and the more experimentalist impulses of recent bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28935-prince-rama/"">Prince Rama</a>-- not to mention Gerrard's own now extensive work on a wide variety of film soundtracks -- Dead Can Dance's approach to sound has resonated widely.</p>
<p>Despite the long layoff, <i>Anastasis </i>is a logical progression from the band's mid-90s albums as well as Brendan and Gerrard's respective solo work since. There's nothing here quite as jawdroppingly melodramatic or proclamatory as old classics such as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOOScJXEmOY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Anywhere Out of the World""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJhVM930YXY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Host of Seraphim""</a>, where Perry and Gerrard's vocal strengths were matched with the sense of vast spaces, agog and in awe. But <i>Anastasis</i> often comes close, especially with the concluding ""Return of the She-King"" and ""All in Good Time"". Gerrard's breathtaking vocal range remains strong, while Perry's deeper, ruminative voice still feels less like a singing brogue than a calm invocation of ancient knowledge.</p>
<p>The split between Perry and Gerrard's singing parts remains distinct not only vocally, but for the different subjects each explores. That could be a stumbling block in other hands, but always seems to bring out the best where these two are concerned. Perry's forthright mysticism on songs like ""Amnesia"" and ""All in Good Time"" return to the origin of the band's name, the idea of awakening a greater consciousness. On strong opening ""Children of the Sun"", strings, crisp rolling drums, and elegant keyboards suggest an ancestral, courtly ritual, though lyrically Perry runs the risk of creating a naive paean to flower power. Yet it's precisely his controlled delivery and lack of irony-- even with a nursery-rhyme nodding couplet like ""All the queen's horses and all the king's men/ Will never put these children back together again""-- that transforms the song into something with palpable force.</p>
<p>Gerrard's vocal ability is fully intact, and her instrument makes most singers seem limited, or at least unadventurous. The other key element in her singing-- employing glossolalia, substituting comprehensive language with a melodic, exploratory rapture conveyed by her range alone-- defines her lead performances in turn, first appearing to the full on ""Anabasis"", her rich warmth flowing across everything from strings that suggest Egyptian orchestras to electric guitar to, at one breathtaking moment, near silence.</p>
<p>There's a suffused steadiness that steers the album, but with time, the individual strengths of each song manifest; the slow vocal and instrumental raptures toward the conclusion of ""Agape"", the beguiling sway of ""Opium"", where Perry sings about being unable to choose a way forward. And ""Return of the She-King"", one of the band's very few duets, sums up the exact reason Dead Can Dance retain their appeal. It's the kind of impact and elegance that can be hard to put into words, but searching for a perfect expression is arguably exactly what Dead Can Dance have always strived to achieve. Here, they find it more often than not.</p></div>"|16906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16906-anastasis/|8.0|Ned Raggett

Two years ago, Swedish duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29643-niki-and-the-dove/"" target=""_blank"">Niki and the Dove</a>-- aka Malin Dahlström and Gustaf Karlöf-- struck a rare and peculiar seam with the release of their debut single, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTHPO9uQonk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""DJ, Ease My Mind""</a>, on British indie label <a href=""http://www.moshimoshimusic.com/news/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moshi Moshi</a>. Over militaristic clattering drums and swathes of pristine synthesizers (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a>'s precision blown up to Eurovision Song Contest size), Dahlström pleads, ""I want to forget, I want lights to blind me... I want to disappear,"" imploring the DJ to let calm flood her soul by playing a jam that takes her back to a time laced with romantic triumphs. ""DJ…"" is spectacular because it doesn't just feel like a song made for your own euphoric moments in the wee hours; rather, it's a force that bolts your heart to Malin's and forces it to pulse along with hers. Two years in the making, Niki and the Dove's debut album, <i>Instinct</i>, has a borderline greedy hit-rate where all 12 of its songs (not counting the two bonus numbers on the U.S. release) manage to be equally arresting, flitting between the sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/"" target=""_blank"">Fleetwood Mac</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6272-cyndi-lauper/"" target=""_blank"">Cyndi Lauper</a>, and trashy Europop, while delighting in tiny but pivotal moments, sites of emotional precipices and tremendous, history-making passions.</p>
<p>Quality aside, there's a reason why all these songs feel so immediate: Two years is a long time to wait to release a debut album (particularly when Dahlström and Karlöf have been working together in various guises for over a decade), and 11 of these 12 songs have already been given away for free online, or released in EP form. Only the dramatic oriental strut of ""Love to the Test"" is truly new (though new versions of previously heard songs are present), a full-bodied seduction where Dahlström catches a guy's eye across the room, sasses him into giving her his number along with the time, then calls ""Touchdown!"" asking, ""Are you ready for this woman?"" hand undoubtedly on hip. The lack of new material does make <i>Instinct</i> feel like a consolidation effort, perhaps aimed at grasping for the continued attentions of newer fans, but that's certainly not a complaint. If anything, it's a justification of sorts for the sea of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a> comparisons that's followed the duo since the beginning. Although invoking the Icelandic innovator is usually ham-fisted shorthand for ""kooky woman pop,"" there are plenty of experimental leanings here-- and in Niki and the Dove's live show-- that suggest a weirder future for the pair, in similar fashion to how Björk began her solo career in the mid 1990s.</p>
<p>There's not quite an ""It's Oh So Quiet"" on <i>Instinct</i>, but there are plenty of enormous, joyous moments that come close enough to that sensation, with plenty more going on than in your common or garden banger. The victorious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13430-tomorrow/"" target=""_blank"">""Tomorrow""</a> opens the LP, followed by ""The Drummer"", where a high-pitched sonar blip needles through thundering synthesizer sashays, Dahlström's drum-like heart powering her assault across a topography of nerves and difficult decisions. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15699-the-fox/"" target=""_blank"">""The Fox""</a> jabs like a razor-sharp ballet, bloody cello chopping beneath gloaming synthesizers as Dahlström asks a four-legged beast to bury to bury her fears so that she might sleep. The dark grind of ""Under the Bridges"" transports her back to a dark and dangerous zone on a city's edge where a friend confesses a secret that remains untold. It doesn't matter what it is-- there's something about the visceral, elemental nature of Niki and the Dove's production that takes you right there, shivering and pulling the collar of your coat close as wind whips under the viaduct.</p>
<p>They pull you into the back of the cab on ""Last Night"", too, where you're a gooseberry gamely drawing hearts in the window condensation as the protagonists get ""married in a taxi,"" Dahlström steeling her heart against getting too attached by invoking the scorn of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23583-stevie-nicks/"" target=""_blank"">Stevie Nicks</a> circa <i>Bella Donna</i>. It's not difficult to spot the fact that the situations described in most of Niki and the Dove's songs take place at night, which is rarely a zone of abject fear for the characters within, but a canvas against which to conquer anxieties and triumph romantically. On the soft, Prince-like stroke of ""In Our Eyes"", Dahlström sings, ""I'm the night now, but I will shelter you,"" as if she's a wise sage offering protection. If the night is an embrace in which to seek succor and work out complex thoughts, then the nightclub of Niki and the Dove's breakout hit seems by default a kind of transcendental, heavenly zone where the most intense and vital decisions get their hearing. It's fitting, then, that they've made an album against which it's easy to imagine having similar experiences.</p></div>"|16758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16758-instinct/|7.9|Laura Snapes

The MC could be the runner-up in a liar's contest or the realest thing alive, a complex abstractionist or a to-the-point all-hooks shouter, a callow youngster or a restless veteran. And no matter what, that mic is in that hand because someone needs to present an identity to the world. What they almost never do, by necessity over just about everything else, is deliberately obscure that voice. Burying it in the mix, dialing it down to a background murmur, running it through contradictory, vague themes that seem ambiguous in intent and delivery: these are things that threaten to cut an MC off from a real human connection with an audience, especially a newly arriving one that's taking a chance on a relative newcomer based on hearsay and association.</p>
<p><a href=""http://jeremiahjaer.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeremiah Jae</a>'s Brainfeeder debut, <i>Raw Money Raps</i>, breaks that cardinal rule repeatedly. And that this leads to a fascinating enigma of a record rather than an alienating slog is some kind of minor miracle. Jae comes with an enthusiastic co-sign from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>, and the L.A.-via-Chicago producer/MC has the sort of classic demos-to-indie-breakthrough career path laid out that should continue to do him good when it comes to cultivating his more self-directed experimental tendencies. But <i>Raw Money Raps</i> isn't one of those easy-access phenom artifacts that explodes out of nowhere and spawns a sea of instant-cult hashtags. It's the kind of record that seems engineered to throw people off, keep them wondering, and make them try and connect some dots of stylistic influence that lead into places that don't entirely seem attached to anything else.</p>
<p>Jae seems to fit in the context of a producer-as-MC rather than vice-versa. His tendency to focus more on beat tapes than lyrical exploits early in his career has led to a style that uses his production as a filter that he channels day-to-day concepts through until they become something more personal. With the exception of ""Cat Fight""-- a Flying Lotus beat that rides on chipmunk vocals, head-swimming strings, and distorted Pam Grier clips that resembles a Madlib track so closely it almost feels like an inside joke-- <i>Raw Money Raps</i> is a fine demonstration of how far Jae's willing to push experimentation in hip-hop production while still leaving something recognizable in his wake.</p>
<p>""Seasons"", ""Tourist"", and ""Greetings"" have the familiar base of Left Coast blunted sample-driven abstraction, but it makes the loops' seams even more fractured, turning straightforward beats into slightly-off rhythms that expand the traditional boundaries of hip-hop meter with their elasticity. The stuff that hews more closely to modern digital-meets-analog production does so subversively. Like how ""Guns Go Off"" takes the staggered build-up that usually gets saved for a track's intro and makes it the entire backbone. And while we're thankfully past the point where classic-rock allusions are necessary to sell a hip-hop record's psychedelic bonafides, the pre-<i>Dark Side</i> Pink Floyd-style keyboard-and-piano haze of ""Ignorant Mask"" and the VU-adjacent distorted twang in ""One Herb"" reveal another fitting branch in his production lineage.</p>
<p>Jae's character as an MC can be just as slippery. This is an artist who frontloads his album with universal-enough statements, like the make-ends-or-else observations of ""Guns Go Off"", the spiritual-minded, salaam-delivering ""Greetings"", and the youth-struggle pull of ""Leaders"". But he gets gradually more idiosyncratic, until by the end he's delivering rambling half-heard conversations about King Kong tactics (""Guerilla (Evolution Pt. 1)"") and proposing myth-killing for the sake of community solidarity (""Hercules Versus the Commune""). Things start going deep into the outer reaches at about the halfway mark, where ""Money and Food"" leads into ""Wires"". The former track is one of those self-conscious club-rap pastiches that might sound like it's goofing on the tropes of the style if it didn't sound so much like Jae's actually wanting to sincerely try it on. The latter is a reverbed-to-oblivion swoon of off-beat delivery that sounds like it's being reeled off inside a waterlogged nuclear reactor; you can make out maybe half his lines, if that. If you're a fiend for quotables, you might get frustrated. There's this quality to his voice that makes it impossible to separate it from the music it's embedded in, or the words from the beats. And it sometimes means recalibrating your ears so the non-verbal aspects of the music take precedence and you open yourself up to let the actual lyrics sneak up on you. It's hip-hop as dream logic.</p>
<p>Jae is just as interested in treating his voice as an instrument to be manipulated as he is in actually putting literal messages across, and if that makes what could be his more allusive moments frustratingly vague, it clicks well as sheer music. His voice itself is a bit low-energy, but in a way that actually has some personality to it. And in doubling itself up with pitch-shifted shadows, running it through grainy home-tape murk or swaddling it in shuddering bass, that voice gets an edge to it that hints at deeper things beneath even the most well-worn clichés. <i>Raw Money Raps</i> is immaculately constructed as identity crises go, and there's an uncontrived honesty that feels more like someone working through a multifaceted outlook on life than testing his options for which crowd to play to. Even if you have to strain to catch that voice, its presence still has weight and meaning, whether it's unfiltered consciousness or some elusive subliminal subtext. A lot of people talk loud and say nothing; Jeremiah Jae finds strength in the inverse.</p></div>"|17001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17001-raw-money-raps/|6.8|Nate Patrin

Screeching bursts of arrhythmic synth noise? Microseconds of groove suddenly obliterated by a minute of hairy blast beats? Torturous polyp-producing screams? Fucked-up time signatures that would give migraines to all three members of Rush? These sounds are not doing big business on the summer festival circuit.</p>
<p>Not that greedy-eyed A&amp;R men were grooming the Locust for stardom 15 years ago either, but weirdly I knew a lot of people who saw them as the fashion-conscious and crossover-hungry version of the hardcore underground's ultra-violent streak. With scene politics blessedly in the rearview of my life, this take seems patently insane to me now. Maybe it was the goofy onstage costumes or the knowingly kitschy packaging. Because otherwise, how could anyone listen to this stuff and think ""sell-out"" unless they'd fallen so far down the extreme music rabbit hole that anything less than total sensory assault felt like pop?</p>
<p>On the other hand, canny marketing might be the only explanation for how these guys, as ferocious and uncompromising as any of their peers, found themselves as the deranged cousin to the screamo explosion of the early 21st century. This was music so intrinsically alienating that it could only ever hope to appeal to a small coterie of pain-addicts and assorted other masochists. One did not buy records by Spazz or Crossed Out or even the Locust because they wanted to make nice with their wider peer group. Here's how your ""standard"" Locust tune goes: The band screams and bashes for a few seconds, pulling tricky extreme metal moves with a hardcore band's looseness and brute force. Then everything drops out for a goofily <i>sturm-und-drang</i> breakdown, or keyboards that sound like incidental music from some schlocky 1950s sci-fi flick. Some more bashing and screaming, and we're out in less time than it takes to microwave a defrosted frozen burrito.</p>
<p>True, occasionally they throw the creepy-crawly electronics up front or at the rear for a change of scenery, which with stuff this potentially monochromatic is important. From this collection: ""Moth-Eaten Deer Head"" comes over like a horror movie in miniature, the shift from the intro of wheezy keys to the full-on roar of the song itself being the moment where the protagonist throws open the bedroom door to find the whole place drenched in gore. Best is when they actually solder the electronics into the flesh of the songs. ""Well I'll Be a Monkey's Uncle"" opens with a shrill announcement from some alien Emergency Broadcast System, but it's also got one of the record's best riffs, even if it happens to be played on a tortured synth set-up.</p>
<p>All of these four-dozen-plus blasts from the id are head-wrecking, dizzying, pick your disorientating adjective at will. And not just because they're usually over before you can grasp any sense of their herky-jerky structures: It's because the Locust still try to pack as many mood swings, tempo shifts, sonic zigzags, and genre curveballs into their briefer-than-brief running times as possible, all while never letting up on the aggro and abrasion. ""How to Become a Virgin""'s ridiculously fast stop-start drumming still manages to punch some of heavy rock's traditional catharsis buttons. They even manage their own bug-eyed take on the multi-part rock epic with ""Flight of the Wounded Locust"", operatic and positively indulgent at almost three minutes long, at least in the context of an album where the shortest tune is a brutal fart of hate called ""Cattle Mutilation"" that lasts 27 seconds.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Calling these songs ""obscurities"" is a bit of a joke in itself. They may have been released on relatively hard-to-find vinyl at the time, but they're only a few shades more primitive than stuff on 2003's <i>Plague Soundscapes</i>, the album that found them listed on the same accounting ledgers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a>. The Locust's later stuff may have enmeshed the electronics and the grind with a little extra finesse and ambition, and it was certainly recorded a hell of a lot better, all of which meant you could almost mistake them for a spazzier and less Hot Topic-friendly version of the Blood Brothers. Not so much here. Sometimes the murk on <i>Genetics</i> means the painful high-end chirpiness of the keyboards is the only thing with any definition, and they're not much interested in reaching out to the kids so much as musically smacking them around. But their basic attack on their quasi-major albums remained the same as on their first album: 1998's <i>The Locust</i>, collected here, which was ""underground"" thanks to both its label and the fact that it sounds like it was recorded at the bottom of Buffalo Bill's basement.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Locust clearly know that the only way to avoid coming off like novelty music for grindcore kids is to play both sides of their shtick as straight-faced as possible, and with as much brutalist conviction as they can muster. Which isn't to say it <i>still</i> might not hit you as novelty music, especially in such a large dose of gross, if you don't already have a taste for this stuff. The long-haul of this whole comp, even at less than an hour, is designed to separate the gawkers from the legit geek-show fans. Tentative newcomers may want to start with their later, higher-def, and <i>slightly</i> more ""accessible"" albums. For those of us who delight in gross-outs and wacko caterwauling and oppressive noise for its own sake, <i>Genetics</i> is a lo-fi and hideous laugh riot.</p></div>"|16935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16935-molecular-genetics-from-the-gold-standard-labs/|5.8|Jess Harvell

Great, they do too. Enjoy. Because you can name the first 10 bands off the dome that fit into your idea of what ""indie rock in the 90s"" meant, and something on <i>Nothing Bad Will Ever Happen</i> will probably sound like each one of them. But they can't exactly be pegged as 90s revivalism, because that term implies not just worship, but a kind of evangelical zeal that Dignan Porch lack. You can argue how much they ever courted a traditional idea of ""success,"" but it's absurd to say Pavement or Guided By Voices or Yo La Tengo ever lacked ambition or failed to convey their own personalities within their music. Dignan Porch don't have a grip on those things quite yet. So this feels like rock music that abides by ambient's goal of creating a respectful and effective alternative to silence. No matter how much care and craft went into it, you ultimately feel like its creators intentionally are trying to avoid being noticed.</p>
<p><i>Nothing Bad Will Ever Happen</i> is technically the second record made by Dignan Porch, but the first in which ""Dignan Porch"" refers to a five-piece band rather than main singer-songwriter Joe Walsh. The production gets a significant upgrade from wooly fuzz to ""scruffy,"" keyboardist Hayley Akins' vocals become a welcome counterpoint, and the songs are allowed to meander amiably. It's actually fascinating just how baseline Dignan Porch get here: <i>Nothing Bad Will Ever Happen</i> certainly doesn't sound expensive, but by no means is it lo-fi. It's hummable, but the melodic progressions most of these songs follow failproof them. You can make out some of Walsh's lyrical themes-- drugs, girls, general bummer-ness-- but rarely do they follow an emotional trajectory. Walsh's vocals in and of themselves are indicative of an everyman middle ground. He's occasionally obscured by the production, but not in a way that appears to be a conscious atmospheric choice as opposed to one determined by the record's budget.</p>
<p>But really, it just comes down to Dignan Porch writing songs that are no better or no worse than most of their peers. ""Picking Up Dust"" and ""Darkness"" are equally jaunty and scuffed-up in a manner that's expected of something on Woodsist, where they'd be undoubtedly overshadowed by Woods' idiosyncratic production of the same kind of material. The guitar leads on the sunburned ""Pink Oil"" recall maybe five different tracks from <i>On Fire</i>, but the song as a whole lacks a real sense of place or perspective. And of course, a UK band making predominantly American music on a hip indie label has to reckon with Yuck's pitch-perfect <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15068-yuck/"" target=""_blank"">debut</a> from last year doing this exact thing with stronger hooks, more distinctive lyrics, and musicality with far more body and resistance. </p>
<p>It'd be nice to know what moves Dignan Porch as artists as opposed to mere listeners, but they don't seem all that caught up in giving much of themselves. If Dignan Porch happen to find you as opposed to the other way around, it's a pretty easy record to make the best of. They're the opening band you actually kinda enjoyed even though you showed up too early by mistake, the album you half remember liking when it was playing in a friend's car.</p></div>"|17009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17009-nothing-bad-will-ever-happen/|5.9|Ian Cohen

<p>The first and most important thing about the soundtrack to <a href=""http://davidlynch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Lynch</a>'s surreal 1977 cult film masterpiece is that it's not like any other soundtrack in your collection. This is no ""music from and inspired by"" set and it doesn't gather orchestral cues from the film's score. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Eraserhead</i></a> is a sound track (two words) in the literal sense. It contains 38 minutes of the sound that accompanies the 89-minute film's picture. When you are listening to this LP, you are hearing a movie. And it works, because Lynch and his late collaborator, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0819263/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alan Splet</a>, had a rare ear for the immersive and emotional possibilities of sound. The sound design in Lynch's films is consistently brilliant, brimming with details that enhance the mood and further the narrative. And here on <i>Eraserhead</i>-- Lynch's first feature, most personal film, and in many ways the strangest movie he ever made-- his and Splet's aural genius was already fully formed. Working with the analog technology available in the 1970s, they created a richly textured and evocative world.</p>
<p>The narrative details of Lynch's movie aren't essential to this set, but they do help to put the album into context. <i>Eraserhead</i> tells the story of Henry Spencer, a strange and quiet man with bushy hair who goes about his business in a parallel universe with a skewed relationship to our own reality. The streets in Henry's neighborhood are empty and dark, but you can hear dogs barking in the distance and you feel like something unpleasant might be lurking around every corner. Somewhere out of sight, enormous boilers and blast furnaces are constantly churning, belching soot into the sky and pushing tendrils of steam into cramped one-room apartments. It's a lonely, menacing place, modeled in part from Lynch's memories of his time living in a rough neighborhood in Philadelphia. Eventually, Henry finds that his girlfriend Mary has given birth to...what, exactly, is never clear. ""They're still not sure it is a baby!"" she cries at one point on the soundtrack. Lynch and Splet render this setting with a varied mix of creaks, rumbles, hisses, and roars. Theirs is a place of polluting industry, clacking trains, dangerous electrical whirrs, and a screaming infant from the unknown.</p>
<p>Purely as a listening experience, you could file <i>Eraserhead</i> next to the ice cold drift of Thomas Köner's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1teSrZ1LE7M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Permafrost</i></a>, the tape-heavy pieces found on the first Godspeed You! Black Emperor album, the subliminal voice and sound-effect rumble of Robert Ashely's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh_TC8j_JkE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Automatic Writing</i></a>, and the fuzzed-out radio transmissions of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m9O6LrQyTk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Music for Nitrous Oxide</i></a>-era Stars of the Lid. Throbbing Gristle's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPrTUC7BDn4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hamburger Lady</a>"" channels a comparable nightmare, the swampiest and most decayed bits of Brian Eno's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4AYiHlAf0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>On Land</i></a> might be found somewhere inside this world, and you could imagine the metallic drones of Nurse With Wound's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSnF_Jaaf00"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Soliloquy for Lilith</i></a> leaking out of Henry's floorboards. <i>Eraserhead</i> is dark ambient, in other words, a few years before that term had come into wide use. And despite its origins as the sound component of a film, it works terrifically well as <i>music</i>, provided your definition extends to the artists mentioned above. You'll hear some funny dialog about things like ""man-made chickens"" here and there, delivered in that distinctively Lynchian sing-songy deadpan. But the album as a whole is something you sink into, a shadowy vision of a frightening place.</p>
<p>Beyond the machines and industry, two more traditionally musical elements are found on the album. One recurring motif is the use of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK6pt-nXSvI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">solo organ pieces</a> from the 1930s played by Harlem jazz legend Fats Waller. The creaking organ tones, played by a man from years ago on a wheezing mechanical device, form a natural complement to the sound effects; they cycle in and out, bringing to mind a cracked memory of another time or place that never quite comes into the focus. And then there is the song ""In Heaven"", sung in the movie by a tiny woman with disfiguring acne who lives in Henry's radiator and serves for him as a source of warmth and comfort. ""In Heaven"" developed a life of its own outside of <i>Eraserhead</i>, most famously in the indie rock world when it was covered first by the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsRrQLY5s_8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pixies</a> and then, later, when incorporated into Modest Mouse's single ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vg8fZwAKE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Workin' on Leavin' the Livin'</a>"".</p>
<p> ""In Heaven"" still fascinates because of its ambiguity. It's both deeply creepy and somehow a little bit uplifting, never quite sure if it's celebrating life or death. On this vinyl reissue from Sacred Bones, it's also included as a 7"", the flip side of which is an instrumental piece in a similar style laid out by ""In Heaven""'s composer, Peter Ivers. Taken all together, this beautifully packaged reissue is a thorough and complete presentation of Lynch and Splet's soundworld, complete with photos and stills from the film set on heavy card stock. It takes something moving and important that is in danger of being lost and bring it to a new audience, which is exactly what a reissue should do. And there's something reassuring about knowing that Lynch's ""haunting dream of dark and disturbing things"" lives on, finding people willing to put it on the turntable and make their own pictures.</p>

So far in 2012, the two best examples come from opposite ends of the world: The fine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16409-gentleman-jesse-leaving-atlanta/"" target=""_blank""><i>Leaving Atlanta </i></a>by Georgian tunesmith <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30307-gentleman-jesse/"" target=""_blank"">Gentleman Jesse</a>, and the spirit-lifting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16599-royal-headache/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a> by Australia's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28185-royal-headache/"" target=""_blank"">Royal Headache</a>. You know the reference points for this music: mid-period Replacements, early Elvis Costello, all-eras Tom Petty. These records exist at the intersection of middle-American punk and heartland classic rock. No matter what is happening in the rest of the world musically, there are always people-- mainly young, scruffy-haired white guys, though women sometimes get in on the act, too-- who write snappy, no-frills three-minute pop-rock songs, and then package them into 10-song, 30-minute records. It has nothing to do with being fashionable. Certainly, the world doesn't necessarily ""need"" more records like this, which is why they eventually tend to languish in record-collector obscurity. But arguing against the continued existence of this music is like saying they shouldn't make new kinds of beer. Why limit the production of what is, first and foremost, a populist pleasure producer, even if the variation among new products is minimal?</p>
<p class=""p2"">After all, the exact right combination of simple, chunky chords required to create The Perfect Rock Song That Makes All Other Rock Songs Irrelevant has not yet been achieved. Surely, this is what has motivated Chuck Betz, Ryan Naideau, and Jimmy Shelton as they've played and recorded as Nude Beach for the past four years. <i>II </i>is a record created with the belief that a trebly guitar riff, a no-bullshit drum beat, and a heart-melting chorus can still rip out the hearts of hopeless romantics young and old. Thankfully, Nude Beach are skilled enough as songwriters and unskilled enough as musicians to re-affirm this belief yet again. </p>
<p class=""p2""><i>II </i>came very close to being one of those highly enjoyable power-pop records that end up locked inside some local scene somewhere. It was the latest in a series of self-released records distributed by the band on cassette and vinyl at shows in and around Brooklyn. Nude Beach's profile was raised this past spring during a tour with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29754-the-men/"" target=""_blank"">the Men</a>, and after the initial pressing of 500 copies was sold out, <a href=""http://www.othermusicrecordingco.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Other Music Recording Co.</a> stepped up to give <i>II </i>a wider release. </p>
<p class=""p2"">Those who picked up <i>II </i>after catching Nude Beach in concert were rewarded with a record that faithfully preserves the group's unpretentious bar-band charms. While Nude Beach self-identify as punks, <i>II </i>is more akin to pub rock, the roots-driven movement that pre-dated the Sex Pistols in mid-70s England. Elvis Costello had connections to that scene, and <i>My Aim Is True </i>is an obvious touchstone for <i>II</i>--<i> </i>particularly ""Keep It Cool"" and the beery bear-hug that is ""Cathedral Echoes""-- but Nude Beach don't aspire to Costello's erudite lyricism or furious posturing. This is good-time, forget-your-troubles music whose primary subject is the pure, uncut joy it inspires. The album-opening <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13979-radio/"" target=""_blank"">""Radio""</a> is made for the very thing the title references, barreling forward with an enthusiasm ideal for car stereos and rolled-down windows. ""You Make It So Easy"" is an affecting slow-dance number conjuring the memory of a million other slow dances, both real and imagined. ""Love Can't Wait"" is the scrappy Tom Petty knock-off, delivered with enough affection and endearing awkwardness to make the thievery not only forgivable, but almost heroic.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The only knock on <i>II, </i>again, is that this kind of record is like the city bus, and there's likely another carrier of endearingly disheveled hooks already looming around the corner. As likeable as the album is, there's no saying it won't get out-maneuvered by the next garage band that bashes out a half-hour of blue-denim melodies. What Nude Beach have on their side is songwriting ability and an unshakeable work ethic. That scrappy corner-tavern rock record coming on the horizon might very well be made by them, too.</p></div>"|16962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16962-ii/|7.4|Steven Hyden

But when Manchester's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30622-the-1975/"">the 1975</a>-- then known as the Slowdown-- dropped <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1kl3MguTKk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sex""</a> last year with no contact info whatsoever, I immediately had two thoughts. The first was, ""Someone still makes music like this?"" The second was, ""How exactly are they supposed to score a record deal?"" since ""Sex"" was a suspiciously slick, born-ready anthem that was simply waiting for a stadium to fill.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The 1975 have since revealed their names, started a <a href=""https://twitter.com/the1975"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> account, and gone legit with their first EP, <i>Facedown</i>. They're still a band graced with a gift for heart-on-sleeve theatrics but an unsteady hand at presentation. The title track is a fine intro, a wash of ambient guitar and low, patient harmonies that usually herald a band's ""atmospheric"" second LP. It leads into ""The City"", where drum machines are maxed out, confidently thumping like the best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27750-the-big-pink/"" target=""_blank"">Big Pink</a> singles do, adding a preternatural ability to be unimpressed with the possibilities of a night out.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Rather than building on ""The City""'s momentum, the EP's second half tacks on two consecutive ballads, the overall torch song-to-burner ratio on <i>Facedown </i>settling at an unwise 3:1. It starts to feel like less of a complete statement than a version of the 1975's potential debut where the singles went missing. ""Antichrist"" has ambition but only a vague sense of what it's reaching for, and you can get away with leaning on a word like ""capricious"" in a hollowed-out showstopper if you're Brett Anderson. Murky closer ""Woman"" makes it clear that the 1975 shouldn't feel any rush to grow up, at least not if it means edging towards Jeff Buckley worship as they do here. </p>
<p class=""p2"">It's a muddle, but a promising one, hence why having background information on the 1975 works in their favor-- they've been playing together for a decade, and each member is between the age of 20 and 21. It makes sense that they're musically together, but still grasping for their sense of self. <i>Facedown </i>to a certain extent proves ""Sex"" wasn't a fluke, but all the attendant trappings of <i>being </i>the 1975 are still yet to be sorted out; they spent 2011 trying to fool us and they'll continue to be a band worth checking for if they decide not to fool themselves. </p></div>"|17062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17062-facedown-ep/|6.2|Ian Cohen
