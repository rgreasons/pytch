The man born Darren White has been at it long after the genre went through its initial early cycle: experimental beginnings, urgent development, mainstream crossover, post-trendiness deconstruction, and being re-niched back to urgent development again. That's afforded him the sort of later-career freedom that happens to be accompanied by steady quality and the occasional revelation. He's switched up styles as often as he's tweaked his alias' structure; the D-Bridge that gave the mid 90s masses hardstepping junglist tracks like ""Let That Shit Ride"" and ""Bring Da Flava"" is a fair distance away from the more R&amp;B-tinged dark ambient of early 10s dBridge a la ""Love Hotel"" and ""So Lonely"".</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If that means he's got multiple audiences of varying investments to try and satisfy, his EP-length releases often do a good job of showing off all his facets, from the downtempo excursions to the classic drum and bass he never really abandoned. </span><i>Move Way</i><span>, dBridge's new EP and his first for the evergreen <a href=""http://www.randsrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R&amp;S</a> label, puts a strong focus on his efforts to maintain the structural integrity and rhythmic impact of drum and bass while pushing its forms outward from the template-driven repetition he's spent his post-Bad Company career trying to counterbalance. His recent approach with the Autonomic label/podcast/dance night established a space for minimal, half-step takes on the style. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But </span><i>Move Way </i><span>isn't quite as out there, at least on its first two tracks. The title cut, a co-production with Exit Records roster member Skeptical, pushes 170 on a driving triple-kick pattern riddled with crisp snares. Despite its sawn-off feel-- its sharp, trebly drums and bright rhythmic counterpoints  feel constructed to let a dynamic range shine through, rather than charging headfirst into bassbin-quaking territory--  it still hits a dancefloor mark pretty close to the intense post-jungle complexity of the late 90s. Cerebral aggression is still aggression, and the recurring sample of a fired-up Peter Tosh discussing the liberation of pissed-off epithets doesn't hurt any. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15786-death-of-a-drum-machine/"" target=""_blank"">""Death of a Drum Machine""</a> is even more of a throwback, if a line-blurring one: its airy spaces and hi-hat heavy beats are just a 70s soul-jazz lick or two away from evoking the cool fusion of 97/98 era sides by LTJ Bukem or Photek, but they charge ahead as hard as anything Moving Shadow put out five years previous. Any charges of retrograde pandering should be tempered by the fact that this music, being in line with the genre's great innovators, is still kicking against the dumbing-down of drum and bass, even if on familiar terms.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>At the end of the EP, dBridge offers a cut that scratches the itch that his more ambient recent singles might have created. ""Plain to See"" is given the same wide-open negative spaces as his other half-step tracks, sculpted from click-track beats snapped into scattered form. Creeping synthesizer chords pierced with sharp, stark notes add to the intricacy of what initially sounds like a simple, sparse rhythm. When the beat finally builds to its full shape, it unspools into another nuanced exhibition of what he's been mastering in his drive to reinstate drum and bass' creative curiosity.</span></p></div>"|18351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18351-dbridge-mosaic-vol-2/|6.6|Nate Patrin

There are such characters as its poster boy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>, the dispensary-fueled scion of a radically progressive musical family, and the bassist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"" target=""_blank"">Thundercat</a>, who’s singlehandedly propping up the few remaining pieces of jazz funk’s credibility. And then there’s Gregory Shorter, Jr., aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31495-ras-g-the-afrikan-space-program/"" target=""_blank"">Ras G</a>, who might be the furthest out of all of them. The inheritor of an Afrofuturistic musical tradition passed down from Sun Ra and George Clinton, Shorter is the head (and apparently sole member) of something called the Afrikan Space Program. He's seemingly on a mission to gather gather up the best elements of a half-century of revolutionary black music and launch them into a utopian sci-fi alternate dimension of his own devising.<br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>His latest salvo is called <i>Back on the Planet</i>, but it doesn’t feel like the work of an entirely earthbound artist. The opening title track shows off both Shorter’s artistic ambition and his formidable technical skills, with a convincing electronic emulation of the organic, frenetic crackle of an Ornette Coleman free jazz cut that evolves into a mass of irregular drumming, squealing synths, and layers of noise. It sounds like someone’s packed Coleman up in a rickety Apollo module and launched him into low earth orbit.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Back on the Planet</i> spends its first few tracks focused on setting moods and generally avoiding the concerns of melody and steady rhythm. There are soothing arrangements of gently pulsing drums, echo-blurred keys, and the occasional sub-bass boom. Bits of roots reggae drift by, along with ambient waves of analog synthesizer, clips of audio lifted from movies or TV, and a lot of sounds that aren’t so easy to place. The songs don’t really go anywhere, but they don’t need to-- it’s the psychic tone that matters, not any sort of hooks, and the blissful state they produce comes from simply enjoying them in the moment.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s not until “_G Spot Connection” that the sounds start to cohere into something resembling the rap beats that Shorter is ostensibly a producer of. Once he gets focused, though, he stays that way, and the rest of <i>Planet</i>’s 16 tracks consist of the most radical beat deconstructions of his career. “OMMMMM” sounds like vintage Cali rap with all of the drum samples swapped out for assorted snippets of field recordings. “One 4 Kutmah” and “Been Cosmic” take throwback breakbeats and bury them under layers of raw synthesizer freakout. The minute and a half standout “Culture Riddim” revolves around a throbbing synthesizer and what sounds like a sample of someone filling a glass with water.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As freaky as Shorter's compositions get, they still knock hard like rap beats should. It’s a little hard to imagine cruising the streets blasting something like “Natural Melanin Being”, where where the tempo not-so-subtly speeds up and slows down every couple bars, but it would be a sufficiently trunk-rattling experience.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When the L.A. beats scene first broke out with a wider audience, its popularity spiked exponentially and it looked for a minute like that it might being in danger of burning out, its wild experimental edge and deep vein of genuine weirdness diluted by a legion of imitators. But <i>Back on the Planet </i>is proof that its vanguard is still out there-- way out there-- pushing themselves into ever wilder territory. </span></p></div>"|18373.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18373-ras-g-back-on-the-planet/|7.8|Miles Raymer

Scheduling band practice is easy enough, and your group doesn’t break up if you decide you’re living in the wrong town. But the essential asset of starting and running your own group is that there’s no one to tell about the music-- no need to explain to anyone how the guitar tone should shift mid-song, no need to annotate lyrics for someone who didn’t write them, and no need to compromise when the rest of the group either doesn’t agree or simply doesn’t get it. The calls are yours alone.</p>
<p>The previous output from the deceptively sunny-named post-punk/black metal belligerents <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30558-raspberry-bulbs/"" target=""_blank"">Raspberry Bulbs</a>-- a string of short-run cassettes and 2011’s menacing debut LP, <i>Nature Tries Again</i>-- thrived on just such an unequivocal solo approach. Known as He Who Crushes Teeth in his corrosive black metal duo Bone Awl, Marco del Rio spat distorted vitriol over identifiably one-man-band arrangements as Raspberry Bulbs. On <i>Nature Tries Again</i>, simplistic, rubbery bass lines bounced between basic rock rhythms, bashing out time beneath blown-out guitar blisters. The draw was del Rio’s voice, a nasty, weaponized thing that seemed frustrated enough to put the whole world on notice. It was bleak, bothered, and strangely appealing, the kind of thing you wanted to turn up until it hurt. Del Rio’s words were generally indecipherable, a product not only of his unrepentant screams but also of the crude, lo-fi production. But his lyrics, or at least his intentions with them, <i>felt</i> immediately clear. They were stark transmissions from a veteran black metal dude, offering his serrated invective over an atavistic punk plod.</p>
<p><i>Deformed Worship</i> is, by name, the second album from Raspberry Bulbs, but it’s the first one to feature a five-member lineup. A two-guitar quartet surrounds del Rio now, and the band’s good enough that the former multi-tasker can concentrate only on his murderous bark. The new outfit alters the way that Raspberry Bulbs both structure songs and present them: Only one of nine tracks on <i>Nature Tries Again</i>, for instance, broke the three-minute mark, while less than half of <i>Deformed Worship</i>’s nine numbers don’t. “By the Root” stops just shy of six minutes. “Lusty Climbing” keys on a legitimate, compelling bridge. And this is now a group interacting with one another in a room in real-time, meaning that the bass finds the groove and that the guitars are able to trace more than the basic pattern of a riff, with harmonies and counters and stop-time pauses. Toward the end of audacious opener “Cracked Flesh,” there’s even a shift in tone, making it clear that these are more than malevolent, monochromatic tirades-- they’re, like, legitimate songs played by a well-prepared quintet.</p>
<p>Perhaps that sounds problematic. Raspberry Bulbs, after all, are engulfed with a feeling, and shifting from a one-person outfit to a full band is an evolution historically fraught with peril-- the new people simply don’t <i>get </i>the project’s essence in the same way as the person who has fostered it from the start. But this band, featuring ex-members of Rorschach and Italian Horn, does. Though the expanded lineup has affected Raspberry Bulbs’ delivery, it has not changed their spirit. “When a Lie Becomes the Truth” flirts with the thought of suicide as a safe harbor from unfaithfulness, and the band sounds as resolutely anxious and irascible as del Rio. It’s as if they studied the script of <i>Deformed Worship</i>, familiarized themselves with its misery and, like method actors, prepared themselves to wallow in it, too. “Wild Inside” is a teenage tantrum writ large, with del Rio churning childlike turmoil into a seemingly endless vortex; the band responds by keeping it simple, dumb, and angry, joining his pout until they collectively snap out of it. What’s best, all of the new moving parts and increased dynamics give del Rio more space to broadcast his burdens, letting the inchoate frontman shade his screams with a little subtlety. Those first-impact feelings are still there; you don’t need to follow along to intuit that the half-hardcore sprint of “Lusty Climbing” is about rejection in the midst of abject despair. That much is clear in the sound of his voice alone. But his howls take narrative shape now, adding gravity to what was before only a quick if painful punch to the gut.</p>
<p>Though their were indeed melodies pancaked beneath the din, it’d have been a stretch to call much of anything by Raspberry Bulbs two years ago “catchy.” But on <i>Deformed Worship</i>,<i> </i>both “Standing in Line” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15511-raspberry-bulbs-groping-the-angels-face/"" target=""_blank"">“Groping the Angel’s Face”</a> push toward poppy, with guitar lines as sharp as talons and production that allows the vocals to function as more than a misanthropic haze. This is one of those rarified full-band transitions, then, where nothing seems to suffer. Rather than losing any of their earlier power through translation, Raspberry Bulbs have instead found a way to broadcast the same brood for a bigger return. Turn it up again, and this time, sing along to the sulk, rather than simply soak in it. </p></div>"|18250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18250-raspberry-bulbs-deformed-worship/|8.1|Grayson Haver Currin

After a successful solo career stretching through most of the 80s, he left the business at the turn of the 90s for the ministry, about the same time as g-funk was starting to mine his catalog for inspiration and a kid from Pasadena named Damon Riddick was traversing over that same turf for his own early demos. The lineage is so clear and traceable that pairing up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28083-dam-funk/"" target=""_blank"">Dâm-Funk </a>with the recently unretired Arrington seems like an intersection of a no-brainer homage and a dream come true. Anyone who's heard classics like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co3FzW89EpY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Just a Touch of Love,”</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nfrQuKZ1UQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Weak at the Knees”</a>, or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVXYsQWvYu0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Dancin' in the Key of Life”</a> can probably picture how natural and comfortable it'd sound for Arrington to jam over the spaced-out, smooth-gliding bounce of the style that made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13634-toeachizown/"" target=""_blank""><i>Toeachizown </i></a>so immersive. Played straight and aiming right for the retro-funk bullseye would probably result in one of the most effortlessly crowdpleasing throwback records of the year.</p>
<p>That's not quite what they did. <i>Higher </i>is messier than that, and weirder, and ultimately more ambitious. Instead of a straightforward selection of boogie jams that effortlessly recall 1982 and leave it at that, Arrington and Riddick put together something spontaneous, potentially polarizing, and joyously strange. Arrington's lost none of his range or power over the years, and he sounds instantly recognizable as the same man who laid a rubbery, often unearthly voice over tracks three decades ago. But he willfully goes off on odd tangents and improvised-sounding flights, spends a bit of time dodging a traditional on-the-one delivery for a more off-beat performance, and overall treats Dâm-Funk's backing track more like a suggestion to be elaborated on than an authoritative, meter-driving pulse. This is that rare record where the singer beats all the critics in the race to call a sound “angular”-- “that angular approach that's so funky and new,” to be specific, as he points out on “Tap That.” It's a phrase that touches on all the quirks and brow-furrowing curveballs that come with that territory.</p>
<p>Granted, it's not that out of character for Dâm-Funk, though it does seem less experimental than he's been of late. Keeping in mind some of his more daring post-<i>Toeachizown </i>work, from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8XQ9vjND-M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his amped-up yet faithful cover of Human League's “Things That Dreams Are Made Of”</a> to last year's New Wave-via-Minneapolis jam <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjffUs1HbrI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I Don't Wanna Be a Star,”</a> this feels a bit more like a reversion to still-funky, but less eclectic, turf. That means a lot of similar tempos, boom-clap drum machine patterns, and flowing chords-- sounds that barely stray from the <i>Toeachizown </i>palette-- and the musical simplicity threatens to fall into a droning sort of repetition, albeit a pleasant one. On the bright side, it never actually drags, and the production's still a good complement: it feels like Dâm-Funk decided to cede the spotlight to Arrington, leaving his work to buoy Arrington's voice, give him a springboard to riff off, and leaving the more eccentric touches to the singer himself.</p>
<p>And this is where <i>Higher</i> really shines: this is a genuinely sincere, silly, joyous record that seems difficult to actually look down at. What it sometimes lacks in heavy groove and get-down raunch it makes up for in sheer enthusiasm and unpredictability; “the beats tend to sound the same” is less of a concern when they're all glimmering and elated to such effective ends. This album has been in the works for something like three years, but it sounds like it was thrown together off-the-cuff over a weekend by two musicians with a lot of good, pent-up ideas. That's to its benefit, and it makes the giddiness feel extra-human. Arrington has a short monologue in the middle of “I Love This Music” where he mentions how how people tell him how his style keeps changing after all this time. “Yeah,” he explains, “I think like a jazz musician.” Then he lets out this non-verbal string of rapidfire rhythmic scatting that sounds too internalized to be just a mess-around joke, even if he caps it off with a rimshot.</p>
<p>There's a real spiritual vibe that Arrington brings to the table, too, albeit laid out in secular terms, and he seems more like he's ruminating or meditating than singing sometimes. The ceaseless positivity of the lucid memory-banking “Good Feeling” (“I remember Little League baseball, yo/ How the bases were pure white, and the grass was electric green”), the brightly refracting refrains of love-song “Magnificent"", “I Be Goin' Hard' and its “stuck on <i>stooo-pid</i>” defiance filtered through deliberately cartoonish runs that toy with his virtuoso range-- it's somewhere between being church and being #based.</p></div>"|18350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18350-dam-funk-steve-arrington-higher/|7.3|Nate Patrin

Roughly half the songs on <i>Edward Sharpe &amp; the Magnetic Zeros-- </i>the economy sized L.A. troupe's self-titled third LP-- find Sharpe and company singing about love; not just romance, but a bigger kind of love, a force for good in this mean old world of ours. Radiating positivity from every pore, Sharpe's looking to melt cynicism, to stick a daisy in your gunbarrel, to turn that frown upside down. The onetime Imarobot frontman's transformation from dance-punker Alex Ebert to vibe-peddler Edward Sharpe has taken him well past the point of no return. Where the group's 2009 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13852-up-from-below/"" target=""_blank""><i>Up From Below</i></a>, sounds like a tentative first step toward guru status, everything since that shaky debut suggests Sharpe plans to don those flowing robes for the duration. </p>
<p>Melodically, the Zeros keep things on the up-and-up; the arrangements are spacious, often downright sprightly, and by the time the second chorus rolls around, you'll have the whole thing down cold. And though the generously applied harmonies still sound straight outta 1967 California, everything else seems to be gunning for a kind of Beatlesy universality: were it not for names like ""Let's Get High"" or lyrics about jackin' it to Miriam Makeba (no, really), you could teach these songs to a class of kindergarteners. But you know how they always let Ringo sing the easy ones? The ones that they actually do teach to kindergarteners? The Zeros' third LP feels like an album made up almost entirely entirely of Ringo songs: bouncy, spirited, and knock-you-over-the-head obvious, a Raffi for the Bonnaroo set.</p>
<p>But it's not the music that sinks <i>Edward Sharpe &amp; the Magnetic Zeros</i>, it's those lyrics: well-intentioned, certainly, but as deep as the bowl on a one-hitter. Love is all around, and you can hear it everywhere: on ""Let's Get High"" (""…on love,"" ba-dum-ching), on ""Two!"" (""if we sing together, love will sing along""), again on ""Please!"" (""hear me love, see me love""). No matter the song, the message never seems to change: love good, hate bad. Even the best song here, a bluesy solo turn from the underutilized, whiskey-and-ginger-voiced Jade Castrinos called ""Remember to Remember"", can't go by without throwing out a little ""praise to love."" I can't help but think of David Byrne here: say something once, why say it again? On LP3, Sharpe and the Zeros take their message of positivity uber alles and run it so far into the ground, it's positively wearying.</p>
<p>Not that Sharpe fares a whole lot better with a subject change. Opener ""Better Days"" finds him railing against ""some cliché shit"" that makes him ""wanna cry""; a bit rich, when you've got a chorus like ""try to remember that you can't forget."" ""Ain't we all just Japanese when we're high"" is either baffling nonsense or offensive. And turning the late, great Miriam Makeba into some object of lust oozes something that sure ain't charm. ""War is the ego of man's repressed libido,"" Sharpe sings on ""Please!"" Bet you didn't know your libido even had an ego.</p>
<p>LP3 centerpiece ""Life Is Hard"" finds Sharpe taking up the existential longview: ""you will not be called a weakling or a fraud,"" he sings, ""for feeling the pain of the whole wide world."" But moments like these-- when Sharpe swaps out the moony-eyed mantras for what feels like genuine reflection-- aren't easy to come by amidst the record's gloopy sloganeering. It's not enough that he keeps trying to hammer the same point home (""be good to yourselves, and each other,"" more or less); he's gotta yowl it into your ear until you've got no other choice but to submit. And ""ain't love grand"" isn't exactly a new idea, and ""we don't have to talk, let's dance"" isn't much of a worldview. I'm sure Sharpe's heart is in the right place-- he won't stop saying it is, anyway-- but my heart needs relatin', not platitudes.</p></div>"|18314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18314-edward-sharpe-edward-sharpe-the-magnetic-zeros/|4.5|Paul Thompson

Would you have a positive impression of this person? Conversely, what if a band used that list to point out their primary influences? Would you have a negative impression of this band? Would you consider them frontrunners or unambitious or lacking curiosity? They should at least be able to play the game<i> </i>and <i>acknowledge</i> Berlin-era Bowie or mid-90s Mariah Carey, right? <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31568-the-belle-game/"">The Belle Game</a> aren’t trying to fool anyone: those are the influences <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheBelleGame/info"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">slapped on their Facebook page</a> and <i>Ritual Tradition Habit </i>proudly manifests the effect those bands had on the Vancouver quintet. But while Belle Game have taken a lot of cues from the <i>sound </i>of those bands, more importantly, they aspire to the ideal of being a critical and popular darling without sounding <i>cool</i>-- <i>Ritual </i>is unerringly tuneful and tasteful, with confident vocals, meticulous craftsmanship and no fear of being seen as middlebrow. In short, it could’ve come out any time in the past decade and sound just as good as it does in 2013.</p>
<p>The irony is that <i>Ritual </i>is something of a grower as a result of being so familiar. You might think you have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15787-the-belle-game-river/"">“River”</a> and “Wait Up For You” pegged within their first minute. Free of context, the choruses broad pleas based on their titles, “I’ve been your river since we were kids,” “I’ll wait up for you.” “River” begins with a waltz-timed flurry of chalkdust guitars that <i>have </i>to be from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4548-the-walkmen"">Walkmen</a> song you can’t quite recall; the intro of “Wait Up For You” is so reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5653-fleet-foxes"">Fleet Foxes</a>’ “Ragged Wood” that you might just sing the “whoooooooa!” harmonies out of habit.</p>
<p>Any skepticism or accusations of theft are done away with pretty quickly, as singer Andrea Lo is the opposite of a “secret weapon,"" more of a demonstration of just how rare a commanding, powerful vocal presence is in this realm. It isn’t long before “River” and “Wait Up For You” generate enough velocity for liftoff, and the choruses don’t explode so much as slowly levitate and expand with Lo’s vocals guiding the way. No amount of artfully scuffed filters or small-screen production touches can hide that Lo’s a performer through and through, someone who could just as easily have been an R&amp;B powerhouse or at least doing some off Broadway material.</p>
<p>For all the sonic immediacy, it doesn’t take much digging to get to <i>Ritual’s </i>dark roots. The chorus of “River” uses its titular metaphor in a disturbing way-- Lo empathizes with a place where bodies and secrets are dumped. “Wait Up For You” might sound like breathless infatuation, but the narrator appears to be at the mercy of a drunk lover or an absentee father, where the waiting is futile and endless. Lo’s lyrics are in such plainspoken language and the music so instantly accessible that you can easily miss <i>Ritual </i>dealing entirely in the wages of sin: prostitution, abuse, heartbreak, the list goes on. It’s hardly alone in its occasional Fleetwood Mac worship, but more than most bands, Belle Game zeroes in on the codependency and desperation in the lyrics.</p>
<p>Still, nearly everything here gives you a brief glimpse of who they could possibly open for in the upcoming months. As with “River” and “Wait Up For You”, many songs here could pass for a populist indie version of what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field"">the Field</a> did on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10022-from-here-we-go-sublime/"">From Here We Go Sublime</a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10022-from-here-we-go-sublime/""></a></i> in reverse; the “reveal” of the source material happens at the beginning rather than the end. You’ll catch the clacking rhythms and broad harmonies of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28426-local-natives"">Local Natives</a> (“Wasted Light”, “Blame Fiction”), skeletal guitar figures cloaked in reverb a la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx"">the xx</a> and airy vocal runs taken from various <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house"">Beach House</a> songs. They gamely cover their tracks by making good on their “dark-pop” descriptor: “In Secrets” incorporates an intense orchestral swell more reminiscent of Montreal’s late-90s post-rock than its mid-00s indie, while “Salt + Water” is caked with oxidized distortion. Less convicing are the three interludes which intend to give the record some conceptual framework (“Ritual”, “Tradition”, “Habit”), but end up stunting its momentum instead.</p>
<p><i>Ritual </i>ultimately brings to mind some phrase whose source I can't recall, it could've been a famous musician or just someone at a party: “it’s really easy for a band to be unpopular.” It’s a variant on poptimism, an acknowledgment that screaming over guitar ran through five effects pedals isn’t necessarily easier than writing a three-chord jingle. Belle Game shouldn’t be commended <i>just </i>because they’re not trying to be an improvisational noise band or what have you. But there is something weirdly daring about <i>Ritual</i>-- there’s no narrative, no currency, just an arguably naïve trust that they can draw you in with familiarity and let the strength of the musicianship and the depth of the lyrics win the day. It’s especially charming as the <i>O.C. </i>celebrates its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary and causes many of us to <a href=""http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9540828/the-history-influence-music-oc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">look back with both warm nostalgia and a twinge of embarrassment</a> at a time when polite, melodic and sync-able indie rock <i>was </i>indie rock. And for the most part it works; the fact that <i>Ritual</i> would sound good had it come out in 2004, 2008 or 2010 means it’s going to sound good in 2014 and beyond. </p></div>"|18403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18403-the-belle-game-ritual-tradition-habit/|7.2|Ian Cohen

Then something happened. Those who made it got older. Those who listened to it got older. What once sounded hormonally ephemeral became swept up in the stately ebb and flow of nostalgia. To his credit, New Orleans’ King Louie Bankston has always represented the most timeless aspects of this cyclical renewal-- In his numerous bands over the past 20 years he’s played garage rock, and he’s played punk, and he’s played power-pop. It’s power-pop, however, that he’s landed back at. Although his best-known group in the 90s, the Royal Pendletons, exuded paint-peeling garage gunk, they were once produced by power-pop royalty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28727-alex-chilton/"" target=""_blank"">Alex Chilton</a>. His one-off project Bad Times was snarling, spit-flecked punk rock, but it also gave an up-and-coming power-pop master, the late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7921-jay-reatard/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Reatard</a>, some extra momentum. Then, as a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1385-the-exploding-hearts/"" target=""_blank"">the Exploding Hearts</a>-- which Bankston just before the band’s deadly accident in 2003-- he helped reconstitute power-pop for future hook-slingers and jangle-mongers. <br/><br/>With the Exploding Hearts’ tragedy still looming in his rearview-- he <a href=""http://www.nola.com/music/index.ssf/2011/09/versatility_keeps_king_louis_t.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told the <i>Times-Picayune</i> </a>in 2011, “It took a long time for me to go back to doing that kind of music after that”-- Bankston’s current power-pop outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31426-missing-monuments/"" target=""_blank"">Missing Monuments</a> released its debut <i>Painted White</i>. Like its predecessor, the self-titled sophomore album evokes Stiff Records’ late-70s power-pop classicists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5344-nick-lowe/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Lowe</a> and particularly Wreckless Eric, whose wide-eyed, stripped-to-the-bone romanticism oozes from the Missing Monuments ballads “Super Hero” and “Tru Luv"". If only the whole album retained that kind of consistency. Granted, there’s plenty of room for eclecticism under the power-pop umbrella-- but tracks such as “I Don’t Share” lean closer toward Something Fierce’s recent mix of catchy 70s punk and arty proto-wave, to the point where Bankston’s solo-happy guitarist Julien Fried does his prickly best to pay tribute to Voidoids-era Robert Quine.<br/><br/>The influences continue to fly, up to and including Bankston’s credible Stiv Bators impersonation-- gluey yelps and all-- on “Grizzly Star"". But the songs are also torn in another direction: the recent wave of twangy Southern power-pop led by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30307-gentleman-jesse/"" target=""_blank"">Gentlemen Jesse and His Men</a>, a band partially inspired by Bankston’s past work in the first place. For someone as versatile as Bankston, it’s an admirable effort to shove as much stuff he loves onto a single full-length. But his gruff vocals, besides veering in style from track to track, don’t always hit the melody they’re reaching for. “Another Girl” is among Missing Monuments’ stronger showings, a singsong jingle about exactly what it advertises, complete with ripping leads and carbonated bassline. It’s also, curiously, one of the few songs on the album that even attempt to embody the perpetual pimple-squeezing of power-pop. (Then again, it’s sung by drummer Aaron Hill, not Bankston.) Now in his forties, the wizened and world-weary frontman doesn’t try to fake the trapped-in-amber adolescence of his latest chosen genre-- He owns every inch of his age. It makes <i>Missing Monuments</i> a more soulful expression of power-pop timelessness, if not always an even one.</p></div>"|18371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18371-missing-monuments-missing-monuments/|6.4|Jason Heller

It’s the kind of literal, placeholder name usually stamped upon a stopgap release, “fans only, move along.” But let’s get a little <a href=""http://www.danbrown.com/the-davinci-code/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dan Brown</a> with this and crack the code: Sessions. Wave. Next. These words suggest regularly scheduled studio gatherings, impetus, <i>a future. </i>How are we supposed to interpret this when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/571-bloc-party/"">Bloc Party</a> just finished off the biggest tour of their career with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51145-bloc-party-to-take-another-extended-break/"">the announcement of an indefinite and possibly infinite hiatus</a>? Is the urgency and quick turnaround of <i>The Nextwave Sessions</i> an indication that we should keep the faith, that Bloc Party is in a refractory period following a triumphant and prolific past two years? Or are they taking advantage of a surplus of inspiration and momentum to go out on a high note?</p>
<p>Amongst other things, <i>Nextwave </i>shares that jumbled sense of purpose with its predecessor. On <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16944-four/"">Four</a>, </i>Bloc Party returned after a contentious four-year break with conflicting agendas: it was a record that went to great lengths to prove it was effortless, an attempt to convey vigor by rehashing their old sound. By default, <i>Nextwave </i>is less scattered and more consistent: It’s only five songs. But <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51302-bloc-party-announce-new-ep-the-nextwave-sessions/"">“Ratchet”</a> indicates that Bloc Party could’ve gone way further off the grid if they gave themselves enough time.</p>
<p>There’s a perverse thrill in hearing what is almost certainly the worst song Bloc Party could write and still be proud enough to include on a commercially available recording. It’s easy to see how “Ratchet” appeals to Bloc Party-- honed throughout their <i>Four</i> tour as a future fan favorite, you can imagine how leading an arena in a chant of “we go ratchet!” could be cathartic or at least a nice change of pace for a band with a deadly serious reputation. Of course, you might also be of the perfectly reasonable belief that it’s a fool’s errand for <i>any </i>rock band<i>, </i>let alone Bloc Party, to employ “ratchet” in its adjective form in 2013 without embarrassing themselves. If so, you’ll hear it no differently than the times when a rock band does a straight hip-hop cover with the best intentions and the worst execution even if Okereke's ill bars about sour diesel and keepin' it one hundred are his own.<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif;""><br/></span></p>
<p> “Obscene” is the other track Bloc Party recorded with producer Dan Carey and it forgoes the uplift mofo party plan of “Ratchet” to apply the slinky, synth-pop sheen he lent to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes"">Bat For Lashes</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift"">Chairlift</a> last year. Since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9859-a-weekend-in-the-city/"">A Weekend In The City</a>, </i>Bloc Party’s best songs have been ballads. This can seem counterintuitive-- Okereke’s voice isn’t particularly supple or suited to melody and restricting their lively rhythm section to electronics can feel like a misallocation of resources. But Okereke’s voice lends itself well to vulnerability, of trying to sing “pretty” when he doesn’t really have the physical capabilities for it. Likewise, there are only so many barbed riffs and jagged rhythms in Bloc Party’s repertory as a standard rock band, so experimenting with the production and textural qualities of R&amp;B and hip-hop rather than the slang has proven wise. </p>
<p>All Bloc Party albums have at least two softbatch keepers, and the nice thing about <i>Nextwave </i>is that they’re easier to find. In addition to ""Obscene, “Montreal” sounds like the comprehensive Bloc Party, tying in the storytelling lyricism of <i>A Weekend In The City </i>with the electronic, club-minded aesthetic of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12130-intimacy/""><i>Intimacy </i></a>and their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13020-intimacy-remixed/"">remix</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1131-silent-alarm-remixed/"">albums</a>, while guitarist Russell Lissack edges beyond his typical Edge atmospherics and post-punk downstrokes into chorused Police riffs. Elsewhere, “French Exit” is the same ol’ angular Bloc Party growing soft around the edges while the messianic streak in “Children of the Future” has a clumsy charm but not much else.</p>
<p>It does serve as a curious closer since Bloc Party introduced themselves as a band with a savior complex and has evolved into a more humane, fan-focused and knowable act, a cult affair on a mass level. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1130-silent-alarm/""><i>Silent Alarm </i></a>dealt in absolutes and theoreticals-- the songs were either burners or ballads, Okereke in Code Red or a deep blue. <i>Nextwave Sessions </i>continues in the vein of <i>Intimacy </i>and <i>Four </i>in being the work of band that will make tracks using hip-hop vernacular if they feel like it, admit to being exhausted and test out hot producers without committing to an entire album, to make good on Okereke’s wish from “I Still Remember” to make more mistakes. All the same, praising <i>Nextwave Sessions </i>for being “interesting” feels like a cop out--<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1130-silent-alarm/""> </a>Silent Alarm<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1130-silent-alarm/""> </a></i>and even <i>A Weekend In The City </i>gave the listener as much to enjoy as it did to consider, but Bloc Party’s output since then has made it feel like those two qualities are mutually exclusive.</p></div>"|18323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18323-bloc-party-the-nextwave-sessions/|5.2|Ian Cohen

The trio of Robert Scott on bass and brothers David and Hamish Kilgour on guitar and drums, respectively, continues on to this day with irregular tours and albums and <i>Vehicle</i>, newly reissued on vinyl by <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a>, remains just as engaging and immediate as it was 20 years back. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given the group's decades of work, including rarities collections and a career-spanning overview that contained a number of its songs, <i>Vehicle</i> might initially seem just another signpost along the way. But the original context was very different. Geoff Davies of Rough Trade offered to release new songs by the Clean after catching them on a reunion tour in 1989 (yes, they were already on a reunion tour) and the recording came together in just a few short days in London. It’s quietly astonishing to realize that the year of <i>Vehicle</i>’s release, Robert Scott was already two albums in leading <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/616-the-bats/"" target=""_blank"">the Bats</a> while Hamish Kilgour founded his own long running act the Mad Scene; the following year David Kilgour began his own solo career with Here Come the Cars. With such an embarrassment of riches in their side projects, it would have almost made sense if <i>Vehicle</i> had been just an easygoing slapdash ramble. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the songs on <i>Vehicle</i> hold their own. Instead of the rough and ready four-track recordings that marked their early singles and EPs, <i>Vehicle</i> sounds very much like a studio creation, though the fuller sound didn’t harm the performances. Part of the pleasure lies in hearing how each of the band members is so distinct, creating the type of collaboration where the individual parts’ strength meshes rather than trying to outstrip another. The singing from all three is a core part of the Clean's appeal, the back-and-forth between Scott’s affable but never cloying voice and the Kilgours’ slightly gentler but no less engaging approach. Leads are almost always matched by harmonies, and the feeling throughout <i>Vehicle</i> is one of continuity. Scott’s vocal turns on “Big Soft Punch” and “The Dunes” are beautiful contrasts against the giddy arrangements-- especially on “The Dunes”, where he almost seems to easily sashay through both verse and chorus, riding the choppy, always focused shimmer of the arrangement like it was the steadiest thing ever recorded. On songs like “Getting to You” and “Bye Bye”, the distinctive and immediate organ sound that defined them from the start remains, exchanging spikiness and hear-the-keys-being-pressed feeling for an energetic warmth.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Meanwhile, “Some One” has the kind of guitar part from David Kilgour that feels like a big explosion of power without being some wanky mess, while Hamish Kilgour’s drumming is crucial, drawing from the focused flow and power of German art-rock of the 1970s to help show a path to a rhythm-obsessed underground in the 1990s. On songs like “Dunes,” “The Blue”, and “Big Soft Punch”, he ensures that the arrangements have all the propulsion one could want without being overbearing. (The bonus <i>In-A-Live</i> EP included with the reissue, taken from the 1989 tour, shows his quality even more, especially on a run through “Fish” and a monstrous “Point That Thing Somewhere Else”.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Vehicle</i> offers an interesting case study of of how perceptions of a release can come around. The album clocks in at under a half an hour; it's filled with short, melody-on-top-of-melody songs first heard when full CD lengths were starting to become a little more of a norm. Only a couple of songs break three minutes and a good number don’t even make it past two. In a time of vinyl and cassette fetishism in independant music, the fact that this release fit on even one side of a C60 feels perfectly appropriate. But that brevity never feels forced or surprising. Every song really is as long as it needs to be and the album as a whole is a dense concentration of pleasures. </p></div>"|18352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18352-the-clean-vehicle/|8.4|Ned Raggett

Most of the arguments seem to come from rap musicians who’ve fallen out of style and knee-jerk reactionary hip-hop heads who can’t deal with rappers wearing kilts. Few of them make a convincing case.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3631-pete-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Pete Rock</a>, whose production work helped define the 90s “golden age” is a rare exception. <i>80 Blocks from Tiffany's Part II</i>, his second full-length collaboration with the Bronx duo Camp Lo, offers proof that amidst the expeditions rap music’s launching into new sonic territories like EDM, noisy psychedelia, and quasi-industrial music, the classic boom-bap stuff still has a place.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Rock’s one of the few musicians who made his name in the aggressively unflashy 90s East Coast sound who’s managed to stay continually relevant without capitulating to changing tastes. A Pete Rock beat from 2013 works on the same basic level as a Pete Rock beat from 1993, but it doesn’t sound dated. Unlike some of his contemporaries who’ve been happy to go through their careers chopping up the same old breaks they’ve been playing with for years, he’s been constantly evolving his sounds while his method of putting them together has remained fundamentally unchanged.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“No Uniform"", a collaboration here with Brooklyn bruisers M.O.P. is a prime example of Rock’s ability to make old school techniques sound new again. The drum pattern is classic boom-bap, and M.O.P. still flows about the same as they did when they broke through in 2000 with “Ante Up"". But the instrumentation replaces the crackling grittiness that typified the roughneck beats of their prime years with richer, darker tones that smartly fill up the sonic spectrum with a minimum of moving parts. And the fuzzed-out guitar sample looping on top of everything is placed over the drums in a peculiar, precarious way that adds a new flavor of tension to the song.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“Megan Good"", which features a verse by the increasingly respectable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30111-mac-miller/"" target=""_blank"">Mac Miller</a>, takes the new-old dichotomy even further. The snappy, dirty drums and one-note hollowbody bass riff that form the song’s bare-bones foundation would have been familiar to crate diggers back at the dawn of hip-hop, but if Rock had arranged them into a snappy, hip-shaking retro-soul-pop confection a decade ago the way he does here, he probably would have incited a riot amongst pop-averse hardcore rap fans.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like the individual tracks that make it up, <i>80 Blocks II</i> finds new life in well-worn ideas. Its structure predates the modern definition of a mixtape as essentially just an album without a label. It’s more like what DJs and producers put together when they were still dubbing the results onto actual tape-- a freewheeling collage of songs, extended samples lifted from movies and TV, brief instrumental sketches, and spoken word interludes (delivered here by Rock, with his voice pitch-shifted up to helium-balloon squeakiness) outlining the collection’s purpose and its contributors’ bonafides. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And like a lot of those old school mixtapes, <i>80 Blocks II</i> runs too long by almost a third. But in smaller doses it’s easily equal to some of the best and boldest rap music being made right now. There’s something incredibly admirable about the way that hip-hop’s been charging full-speed ahead into the future, but Rock’s music is a good reminder that occasionally looking back over your shoulder can be a very good thing.</span></p></div>"|18353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18353-pete-rock-camp-lo-80-blocks-from-tiffanys-pt-ii/|6.8|Miles Raymer

His delivery is halted, stuttering-- not really a flow so much as a series of strategically layered blocks of wordplay. If you like cerebral rap music, Sand has been your man for some time now, but if you just wanted to turn your brain off, the dissonance of his bars and the aggro-quality of some of his beats might not keep your interest.</p>
<p>But Sandman’s newest project <i>All That I Hold Dear</i> proves to be an enjoyable album both for folks who really listen to music and for those who just skim through it. Listeners who don’t want to have to hear to a song half a dozen times before they can understand and enjoy it should be taken with the project’s sparkling soul beats and verses from Homeboy Sandman that are slightly more modulated than his usual darts of staccato.  </p>
<p>The release was produced entirely by M Slago, a Dallas beatmaker reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5501-9th-wonder/"" target=""_blank"">9th Wonder</a>. As with the North Carolina producer, Slago’s beats are hardy and stuffed with plenty of soul. But for some strange reason, he can’t really get his drums to hit and those too-soft snare snaps can dull the music's impact.</p>
<p>Sand here is as incisive as ever, stream-of-consciousness rhymes shading in the complexities of any given theme. “Musician” may have some worried that they're about to receive another in the endless cycle of lectures about the distinction between rap and hip-hop, but they've got a surprise coming. The track is a deft complaint about being perceived as a rapper rather than as a musician and forms a defense of rap as an essentially musical profession. ""Like there could never be a logical answer other than the music we make,"" Sand raps, in response to questions about what differentiates him from his rapping peers.</p>
<p>Another standout, ""Relapse"", details the kind of pseudo break up where the parties involved continue to circle warily, wondering whether or not they've made a mistake and are meant to be together. And while uncle-rap won’t be burning up the airwaves anytime soon, “Runts” is a touching tribute to Sand’s nephew and niece, which makes up for its triteness with well-observed details about the trials and tribulations of dealing with kids.</p>
<p><i>All That I Hold </i>Dear is the second Sandman release on which the production is handled by a single producer (the first was <i>Kool Herc: Fertile Crescent</i>, produced by EL RTNC), a smart idea that provides a cohesive platform for the rapper to zero in on his talking points. The project won’t attract many new fans, but even those who haven’t been following Sand should enjoy this pleasant, low-key brain food.</p></div>"|18354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18354-homeboy-sandman-all-that-i-hold-dear/|7.2|Jonah Bromwich

Even as some of their members split their time between East and West coasts or points in between, the NYC-based representatives of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30294-mutilation-rites/"" target=""_blank"">Mutilation Rites</a>, Ruin Lust, Villains, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30558-raspberry-bulbs/"" target=""_blank"">Raspberry Bulbs</a>, Ash Pool, and Woe redefine what “black metal” means without abandoning its core ideals or pissing on their roots. Even occult favorites Negative Plane live just around the corner. With their intoxicating new album, Hammer of Night, Yellow Eyes have joined the upper crust of Brooklyn’s blackest. </p>
<p>The album opens with “Light Has Fallen”, ushered in by gentle sound of rain. Yellow Eyes come from a place of rust and decay instead of a pristine Northwestern forest, though, so the quiet only lasts for a moment. Punctuated by pained howls scraped from an unwilling throat, the surprisingly melodic riffing echoes the clear, clean sound that is so often found glinting up from modern black metal’s murky depths and coiled around shoegaze’s darker moments. It’s a sound that’s uniquely American in conception, but European in execution. Manic tremolo picking and intricate, studied compositions intertwine and evolve together, creating something that is indisputably black fucking metal, but still a little strange.</p>
<p>That melodic edge is a crucial part of Yellow Eyes’ sound, not an affectation, and is something that the band strives to perfect and manipulate in turn. The rawness remains. A brief acoustic interlude ends the grim-faced “In This Stillness” and segues right into the icy chords of “Many Long Fingers Bent In Pain”, with its hoarse cries and more straightforward approach that stops on a dime halfway through, just long enough for a sweet little punk rock fill to pop out.</p>
<p>Yellow Eyes keep up the intensity with an almost hardcore zeal. The frenzied quality of moments like “Ice Knell’s middle passage sound on the verge of collapse, but then quickly hunker down into a solid swath of tremolo hellnoise like it’s nothing. <i>Hammer of Night</i>’s title track pulls out the acoustic once again, plucking away at a simple stretch of moody neofolk before the hammer itself comes crashing down and the ride cymbal dictates the proceedings. The same formula worked well earlier on and appears one last time halfway through “Cabin Filled With Smoke And Flies”, though this time perverted with unsettling drones. The album fades out acoustically, petering off into silence. </p>
<p>Yellow Eyes' earlier output showed promise, but the amount of care that was taken in the creation of these six songs is obvious. USBM’s got a new dark horse, and <i>Hammer of Night</i> is one of 2013’s strongest black metal releases. Not bad for a couple of kids from Brooklyn.</p></div>"|18358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18358-yellow-eyes-hammer-of-night/|7.6|Kim Kelly

A torrent of <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/dead-girlfriends-on-fraternity-controversy-grimes-fugazi/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">discussion ensued</a>, much of it centered around the song ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15781-dead-girlfriends-on-fraternity/"">On Fraternity</a>"", whose lyrics offer brief snapshots of situations that point to the fear of sexual assault and the lack of support for victims of violence. Brooks writes eloquently and often <a href=""http://deadgirlfriends.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on his Tumblr</a> about feminism, power structures, and the patriarchy, among other topics. With ""On Fraternity"" he found himself accused by some of “<a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1421372/deconstructing-dead-girlfriends-mansplaining-and-when-being-an-ally-goes-wrong/top-stories/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mansplaining</a>” the dynamics of rape to women who presumably knew more about it than he did. The record turned out to be an unlikely flashpoint for a cluster of ideas bubbling up in culture: What is the role of men in feminist discourse? How should art draw from personal experience and how much can we know about the artist’s relationship to that experience? How should we account for the context created by an artist’s social media presence? </p>
<p class=""p1"">There were more questions, many of them interesting and important. But using this four-song, Bandcamp-released EP by a bedroom electronic musician as a pivot for them was, perhaps, more than the actual musical content warranted. <i>Stop Pretendin</i>g, as a collection of electronic pop songs, wasn’t sturdy enough to bear the weight of it all and was quickly crushed under the dialog. We’ll get to those ideas in a second. But first, pulling the EP back out from the pile-up and listening again, we find four songs that extend the sound of Elite Gymnastics but in a smaller, closer, more intimate way. Brooks isn’t much of a singer, so he half-speaks and Auto-Tunes his lyrics, creating vocal melodies that are reasonably memorable. He offsets his pedestrian vocals with tics that try and make the music more expressive and conversational-- little breaths and sighs, words twisted into the sing-song exasperated cadence of a teenager. One of the last things we heard from Elite Gymnastics was a song called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14115-andreja-4-ever/"" target=""_blank"">“Andreja 4-Ever”</a>, a tribute to feminist theorist Andrea Dworkin that was Brooks’ brightly-colored yet modest stab at an anthem. <i>Stop Pretending</i> never tries for that sense of scale. </p>
<p class=""p1"">As with Elite Gymnastics, the most immediate musical references are from the 1990s and early 2000s-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1928-her-space-holiday/"" target=""_blank"">Her Space Holiday</a>, Pacific Northwest indie pop like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2419-land-of-the-loops/"" target=""_blank"">Land of the Loops</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"" target=""_blank"">the Postal Service</a>. The title track is a dense confection that includes a sample that sounds like it could have come from the soundtrack to <i>Riverdance</i> along with the “Funky Drummer” loop, a sample so obvious it was obviously chosen by Brooks as a kind of shorthand, pointing back to the music of a specific era. “Omertà”, is a delicate, affecting instrumental with slowly-shifting drones and simple and spare piano notes. And then “On Fraternity” is the point on the album where the music takes a darker turn, as the metallic screech of noise music surges and retreats (Brooks is a fan of extreme artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4765-whitehouse/"" target=""_blank"">Whitehouse</a>) leaving behind spaces filled with tension. On a purely musical level, there’s a Tumblr-like quality to Brooks work, as he pulls sounds and samples from all over and combines them in a personal way that doesn’t hide its dependence on existing sources. If <i>Stop Pretending</i> lacks some of the grandeur of Elite Gymnastics, it’s also a worthy attempt to create small-scale music that feels as intimate as a gchat conversation.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">And then there are the themes, which mix the small and personal with the broad and universal. A certain amount of friction was inevitable. When you write lyrics like “Tell me again about how heavy the crown is/ About the weight of the burden of being white and male” and you <i>are</i> white and male, people are going to question your motives. A songwriter like Randy Newman, who would leave the listener searching for a satirical wrinkle to explain the on-the-nose phrasing, could get away with it. But once you’ve read interviews with Brooks and spent some time with <a href=""http://deadgirlfriends.tumblr.com/post/51711791274/this-is-a-quote-from-a-philip-sherburne-piece-on"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his writing</a>, it’s difficult to hear him as anything but straightforward and sincere, and the desire to pick apart his “argument,” such as it may be, is irresistible.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As for “On Fraternity”, while some have heard Brooks’ comments as trying to speak for women in general, he’s pointed out <a href=""http://theremixbaby.tumblr.com/post/56833536211/best-new-dead-girl"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on his Tumblr</a> that the gender of the characters is never stated. Both men and women are assaulted, and we have no idea what Brooks’ own experiences in this realm might be, so all we’re left with is the words he’s given us. There are lines about being preyed upon, about people being afraid to talk, about people wanting to paper over transgressions in the name of community. The song exists in relationship to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12617-oblivion/"" target=""_blank"">“Oblivion”</a> by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a>, sharing some of its imagery and concerns (Claire Boucher of Grimes lives with Brooks), but where her song is filled with poetic suggestion and metaphor, Brooks’ seems to point fingers. It's emblematic of the clumsiness that gets in the way here, as we see a thoughtful person not quite knowing how to get his ideas across. In trying to communicate thoughts about the issues important to him, Brooks runs into pronoun trouble: this self-released EP, intermittently successful as a collection of electronic pop songs, is filled with “you” and “they” when a few more uses of “I” might have helped. </p></div>"|18389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18389-default-genders-stop-pretending-ep/|6.6|Mark Richardson

People tried that in the mid 2000s, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10116-return-of-the-mac/"" target=""_blank""><i>Return of the Mac </i></a>came out to blindside them: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30578-the-alchemist/"" target=""_blank"">Alchemist</a> shined behind the boards, providing a timelessly grimy soul-break soundtrack, while the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep/"" target=""_blank"">Mobb Deep</a> vet refocused and returned to his malevolent street-noir wheelhouse after years of questionable crossover bids. What was originally intended as a promo vehicle for Prodigy's 2008 LP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11444-hnic-pt-2/"" target=""_blank"">H.N.I.C. Part 2</a>--</i> a strong album in its own right-- became one of the MC's defining late-career albums, and set a new precedent for him to live up to in his solo work. Now here we go again: skeptics figured P needed to find some way to regain his footing after his prison bid, his social media beef-not-beef with Havoc, and the rusty compromise of his first post-incarceration albums. And whether Prodigy agreed with them or not, his return to a teamup with Alchemist actually came across like it really <i>meant </i>something, a definitive attempt at reminding everyone just what got him to the point where it matters if he lets people down.</p>
<p>The funny thing about <i>Albert Einstein </i>is that the six-year stretch between Prodigy/Alchemist collaborations means very different things for both parties' art. Prodigy's proven to be best when he finds some new ways to describe his old habits, an endless reserve of sharp threats and cool menace fueling his dark-punchline verses. But Alchemist's switched up his game significantly since the 70s-jukebox R&amp;B/funk break approach he deployed with brutal efficiency on <i>Return of the Mac:</i> he's been on his psych-prog thing for a while now, leaning effectively on pitched-up, complex guitar noodling and lo-fi loops where Hammonds and Moogs hit as hard as kick drums. Hearing one of the giants of NYC hardcore hip-hop spill classic knuckle-to-the-eyesocket rhymes over the same dopamine-jolting hashbar beats that made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16922-russian-roulette/"" target=""_blank""><i>Russian Roulette</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15385-covert-coup/"" target=""_blank""><i>Covert Coup </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29242-gangrene/"" target=""_blank"">Gangrene</a> albums so blown-out and grainy? Why the hell not?</p>
<p>In that sense, <i>Albert Einstein </i>is so casually visceral and immediately gettable that it feels like a recent high point for both of them. Lyrically, Prodigy's delivery is enough to make the constant pile-on of relentless violence blur into something more lifelike and experience-driven than empty threats. He's a cinematographer, letting the scene speak for itself, and even when he gets cute with a punchline-- “I peddle dope longer than Lance Armstrong” (“Curb Ya Dog”) or “Can't come around no more, your mouth runnin'/ Sprints through New York like that marathon Puff did” (“Bear Meat”)-- it all ties in with the bigger picture of a callous, calculating scrapper with a grim wise-ass streak. “Bible Paper”'s first verse invokes <i>Breaking Bad</i> body-removal tactics and reduces an adversary to a “gooey mess” and “special sauce.” And the insomnia-fueled ""Confessions” relays an insomnia-fueled hit on a hotboxing couple with the kind of detail that haunts (“I saw his radio lights through the rear tint”; “Now there's weed smoke pouring out the bullet hole glass”). The appearance of similar-minded guest MCs pays off, too; he stands up well paired with excellent verses by Roc Marciano (“Death Sentence”) and Action Bronson (“The One”), but in ways that feel more complementary than competitive, like old friends and respected peers shooting the shit.</p>
<p>As strongly as his best lyrics can stand on their own, and as good as he's capable of sounding on even the most familiar breaks, Prodigy's vision really gets pulled into vivid life when the beats are especially tense. And while Alchemist's productions have their own foreboding inner life, an MC who can credibly double-up that haunted-house mood makes that production just that much filthier. Practically nothing on the album feels strained, and even less seems compromised. When subject matter and production click the most graphically-- the weathered resilience of the grown-man badass on the daggers-of-sleet piano trudge “Stay Dope”; a remorseless Class of 95 reunion where Havoc and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"" target=""_blank"">Raekwon</a> cut through with molasses-bassline dread and nail-biting disco/funk chase-sequence breaks on “R.I.P.”; metal-caliber threats of Old Testament bodily harm set to the tune of downpitched, shapeshifting Eastern Bloc space rock on “Bible Paper”-- there's a real tactile feeling to it. It's like if the uniquely weathered, evocatively musty sensations of long-shelved, resin-stained gatefold LPs and dusty, cracked-spine pulp crime paperbacks were fused and synthesized into music.</p></div>"|18362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18362-prodigy-the-alchemist-albert-einstein/|8.2|Nate Patrin

Mike Paradinas, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4402--ziq/"" target=""_blank"">µ-Ziq</a>, was of the latter type, and the music he was making at the time managed the improbable task of pushing the boundaries of aesthetics and techniques while also showing a genuine appreciation for less ""intelligent"" dance music styles, producing music you could actually dance to rather than simply appreciate on an intellectual level.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Somerset Avenue Tracks (1992-1995)</i><span>, the 300th release on his Planet Mu label, collects 24 previously unreleased recordings from the very beginnings of Paradinas’ solo career. Split between a disc compiled by his wife (and bandmate in the group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31066-heterotic/"" target=""_blank"">Heterotic</a>) Lara Rix-Martin and one of assorted odds and ends from his DAT archive, the set offers an in-depth look at the lead-up to to the material that would lead up to the albums Paradinas made his name off of, and a portrait of a young artist who displayed formidable talents from the very start.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Paradinas was only 22 years old at the beginning of the </span><i>Somerset Avenue </i><span>era, and although he’d already been playing for years in New Wave-influenced bands, he was something of a beginner in the field of programmed, beat-centric music. It seems like he was a natural, though-- the material here is impressively subtle, especially compared with the relentlessly smiley-faced happy hardcore that had come to define the UK rave scene by the time µ-Ziq launched. <br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“Johnson’s Q-Fab"", from the first disc, is built around what initially seems like a simple combination of a tom-heavy techno drum beat and bits of airy synth pads, but over its seven minute running time introduces an increasing number of complications to the sequence that add a level of complexity. It makes the track far more compelling than the basic chillout-room ambient tracks of the time. Elsewhere, Paradinas dabbles in complexly broken beats, expertly tweaked analog synths, and fine-grained production techniques-- including some stroboscopic hi-hats that sound eerily prescient of EDM’s current trap music phase-- that are hard to believe he accomplished prior to the introduction of easy-to-use, graphics-based digital recording software.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>One of the defining aspects of Paradinas’ body of work is a willingness to mess with genre conventions, often even as those conventions were in the process of being decided. Some of </span><i>Somerset Avenue</i><span>’s most gratifying moments come from experiments with au courant styles. “Boistron” takes the squelching 303 synths popularized by the acid house movement and sets them loose over a jacking beat that’s more spacious than the norm, and adds in strokes of semi-ambient keys that offer a unique twist of the paranoid edge that the form’s known for. “Poc” offers a throbbing, acidified take on the breakbeat style that around the time it must have been recorded was already well into the process of evolving into drum &amp; bass.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Since the time he recorded the material that would end up on </span><i>Somerset Avenue Tracks</i><span>, Paradinas has gone further out, dabbling in jazz funk and other more cerebral-leaning forms, but he’s retained the same admirable focus on making music that’s both challenging and pleasurable to listen to. (An aspect of his personality that extends to Planet Mu’s support for intriguingly next-level styles like Chicago footwork.) Compared with the rest of his catalog, </span><i>Somerset Avenue Tracks </i><span>is as raw as you’d expect from an artist just starting to find himself, but it's strong enough to stand with the best work that he’s done.</span></p></div>"|18307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18307-u-ziq-somerset-avenue-tracks-1992-1995/|8.0|Miles Raymer

In fact, when Pond frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50810-tame-impala-lose-bassist-nick-allbrook/"">Nick Allbrook left Tame Impala to focus on his various projects</a>, he was replaced by <i>another </i>current member of Pond. So while there isn’t a competition between the two, there is an implict sibling rivalry; while the two bands share DNA, one is the genial, goofy ne'er do well counterpart to their more accomplished brother.</p>
<p>That said, genial and goofy are almost always positive attributes in this realm. Allbrook opens <i>Hobo Rocket </i>asking, “Whatever Happened to the Million Head Collide?"" which…yeah. And while you ponder that mystery over a loosey-goosey Bo Diddley beat, all of a sudden it breaks into a Zeppelin stomp of maxed drums and burly blues riffs. <a href=""http://weburbanist.com/2010/12/02/dont-come-knocking-21-vans-that-are-definitely-rocking/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The van's a-rockin'</a>. I’m sure the origin story behind the bombastic glam-stomp <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15619-xanman/"">“Xanman”</a> is a hoot, even if it’s just a result of Allbrook coming across <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-gYOd_MAfk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Zan With That Lean""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftbzkTxlwSQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Nightman Cometh”</a> in the same YouTube spree. No band that takes itself too seriously could write “Xanman”, and it’s a good example of why Pond can serve a purpose against the more refined likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1225-dungen"">Dungen</a> or Tame Impala.</p>
<p>You also have to grapple with the fact that it’s a five-minute song based on the lyric ""Xanman! Won't you understand you're not crying for your xan, man!"" It gets to the core question of just how much ambition and expression you can expect from a record called <i>Hobo Rocket </i>that clocks in at just over a half hour in seven tracks. You can be a witness to Pond’s good time, but can you be an active participant in it? ""Whatever Happened to the Million Head Collide?"" and “Xanman” at least have hooks and something close to coherence. Otherwise, <i>Hobo Rocket </i>quickly becomes a collation of the kind of wigged-out studio tricks that <i>Lonerism </i>was notable for avoiding or at least minimizing, an idea of what Tame Impala would be without Kevin Parker’s consummate songwriting and meticulous editing.</p>
<p>There are no shortage of abrupt tangents and fades, whooshing stereo panning and phaser effects and obscene fuzz tones throughout <i>Hobo Rocket</i>. They’re often more extreme than anything on <i>Lonerism </i>or the loopier <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14279-innerspeaker/"">Innerspeaker</a>. </i>Blast it at a keg party in an open field or ingest the headphone candy by yourself, it holds up either way. But the trickiness becomes a distraction. “O Dharma” and ""Midnight Mass (At the Market Station)"" replicate replicas of Beatles replicas, the same old flanged vocals over strummed acoustics and weepy Mellotron, with little melody to get in the way. “Aloneaflameafloewe"" runs its banshee wails and plodding rhythms through an impenetrable haze of effects, evoking a half-remembered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4675-wolfmother"">Wolfmother</a> festival set. The title track only exists for its vocal EQ’ing; it gives the effect of a radio DJ too drunk to realize his mic’s still on and that he’s been talking over Bad Company for the past four minutes.</p>
<p>Pond mean well and it’s hard to stay mad at <i>Hobo Rocket </i>for very long; it’s quite to easy to take it at face value as stoner rock in a pure form. Then again, that term tends to be misunderstood or misapplied: is it meant to describe the consumers of the music or the creators? Not to cast aspersions on how Pond spend their free time, but when you look at bands ranging from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"">Sleep</a> to Tame Impala that get the same tag, there’s still a precision, studiousness and clarity to their music regardless of the production tricks or narcotized tempos. <i>Hobo Rocket </i>draws out the indulgence, more than happy to engage in dumb fun without bringing much to the party.</p></div>"|18361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18361-pond-hobo-rocket/|5.9|Ian Cohen

The scene is apropos on many levels: in both sound and intent, Pop. 1280 very much seem like the product of the notoriously seedy New York City that was eventually washed away by the dual forces of Giuliani and gentrification. Their future-shocked art-punk brutalism hearkens back to the time when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a> namedropping Philip K. Dick rather than Marc Jacobs, and when Richard Kern’s muse was Lydia Lunch instead of Sasha Grey. And yet more so than any specific aesthetic reference points from that era, what Pop. 1280 most vividly evoke is a bygone 1980s when an after-hours stroll through the Lower East Side could prove more dangerous anything you see on ""Fear Factor."" But after burrowing toward new depths of depravity on last year’s still-startling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16243-pop-1280/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Horror</i></a>, even these miscreants need to come up for air. And like vampires stepping into the sun, Pop. 1280’s tentative crawl toward the light can be a little unflattering.</p>
<p>That’s not to say <i>Imps of Pervision</i> constitutes a major cosmetic change, or that Pop. 1280’s music now sounds anything like the first half of their name; as far as clean-up jobs go, this one was administered with a crumbling piece of wet toilet paper rather than a hydraulic hose. But compared to the apocalyptic clamor of <i>The Horror</i>, there’s a greater crispness and clarity here that, at times, works against the band’s attempts to dredge up the dread. On <i>Horror</i> highlights like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12838-bodies-in-the-dunes/"" target=""_blank"">“Bodies in the Dunes”</a> and “New Electronix"", Pop. 1280 pillaged forth in unison with a creeping intensity, like a street gang encircling its victim in a swarm attack; by contrast, the clearer separation of Ivan Lip’s spidery guitar lines and Zach Ziemann’s shifting rhythms on Imps’ “Lights Out” and “The Control Freak” defuses their imposing mystique, leaving frontman Chris Bug oddly overexposed-- all the bark without enough bite to back it up. (Furthermore, the latter song’s attempt at examining the more mundane sort of monstrous beings we encounter on a daily basis doesn’t pack the same absurdist panache as their cubicle-bound peers in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5308-pissed-jeans/"" target=""_blank"">Pissed Jeans</a>.)</p>
<p>It’s not that Pop. 1280 necessarily need scuzzed-out production to feel convincingly caustic; the corrosively vocoderized “Population Control” is the most aggressively lo-fi song here, but also the most unformed and ineffectual, too. Pop. 1280’s potency is really a function of proper pacing, of allowing sufficient time for the players’ competing parts to cohere into a punishing squall and for Bug to undergo a gradual transformation from simmering unease to strait-jacketed psychosis. And to that end, <i>Imps of Pervision</i> peaks with its torrid middle stretch. “Nailhouse” pounds the deviant groove of The Stooges’ “Little Doll” into submission, with Bug’s increasingly violent fantasias eerily evocative of the current vogue for homemade pressure-cooker bombs; “Human Probe II” and “Do the Anglerfish” are exceptional showcases of Lip’s six-string savagery, unleashing a deep arsenal of caterwauling tones that can drill holes through skulls. Pop. 1280 sustain just enough of that gonzo energy to elevate the more conventionally rendered mid-tempo rockers that make up the album’s back half, however, the morosely monotone closing ballad “Riding Shotgun” suggests they have the aspirations-- if not yet the artistry-- to rise above their sewage-smeared station. Given all the blood, jism, and other bodily secretions the dot Bug’s lyric sheet here, Pop. 1280 are still very much the sort of band that demand a post-listen shower-- this time, though, you just won't need as much soap.</p></div>"|18322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18322-pop-1280-imps-of-perversion/|6.7|Stuart Berman

But while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"" target=""_blank"">Thom Yorke</a> remains his most loyal client-cum-collaborator, Godrich’s production aesthetic has greatly evolved with the times, his current interest in complex electronic patterns and nervy West African-inspired rhythms emblematic of both 21st-century global connectivity and technological dependency. His similarly styled concurrent projects with drummer Joey Waronker-- the electro-pop trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30513-ultraista/"" target=""_blank"">Ultraísta</a> and the more high-profile, Yorke-fronted supergroup <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28660-atoms-for-peace/"" target=""_blank"">Atoms for Peace</a>-- evince the infinite possibilities of the digital age and the claustrophic constrictions of being tied to your machines. Accordingly, both bands have the tendency to feel untamed and caged-in at the same time.</p>
<p>Atoms for Peace, of course, boast an awesome, globe-trotting live show that overpowers the contained quality of their recordings. Ultraísta, however, tour on a much more limited scale, so we have this alternative version of their 2012 debut-- as reassembled by an eclectic, star-studded cast of beatmakers, and at least one legendary director-- to proffer a second opinion. <i>Remixes</i>, however, is a bit of a misnomer. Given Godrich’s densely packed productions, the process at play here is more like an unraveling, an opportunity to peel back the high-beam synths that smother so many Ultraísta tracks and expose the darker undercurrents and sense of unrest bubbling underneath. Presenting radical reconstructions-- and, in some cases, marked improvements-- of each song from the original record in a resequenced order,<i> Remixes</i> makes encouraging strides in addressing the source material’s chief shortcoming: specifically, that every song followed the same formula, to the point of making singer Laura Bettinson sound automated, pre-set. When you have everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"" target=""_blank"">David Lynch</a> on board, uniformity is no longer going to be an issue.</p>
<p>As if to reinforce the notion that <i>Remixes</i> is meant to be heard as a complete, alternate-universe version of the original album rather than a random collection, the new record uses <i>Ultraísta</i>’s closing track, “You’re Out,” as its jumping-off point, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"" target=""_blank"">Prefuse 73</a> retaining its broken-beat cadence but gradually opening up greater fissures in the rhythm bed that hint at the more dramatic deconstructions to come. Not every track recovers from surgery: Zero 7’s slow-motion Italo-disco disassembly of “Our Song” plods on for far too long only to set up a standard-issue chillout-house groove, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28128-falty-dl/"" target=""_blank"">FaltyDL</a>’s smoothed-over “Gold Dayzz” nudges Ultraísta further into café-compilation territory. (A bonus vinyl-only EP offers three additional takes on the latter, highlighted by an exemplary psychedelic tabla-funk transformation by Boom Bip.)</p>
<p>The most succesful remixes here-- from Four Tet’s garage-clattered “Smalltalk” to Canon Blue’s <i>Mezzanine</i>-level “Party Line”-- retain the originals’ melodic integrity but wisely opt to showcase Bettinson’s voice in isolation, lending her a more ghostly presence. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/425-the-books/"" target=""_blank"">Books</a> guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29717-zammuto/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Zammuto</a>’s bone-dry take on “Easier” is especially revelatory, pitting the main vocal line against an anxiously panting backing track and spartan drum beats, drawing out an eeriness and menace barely perceptible on the original. Or, in other cases, they subject Bettinson to sonic abuse: Herbert’s “Static Light” filters her voice through distorted sax squwaks, whereas gloomy Brooklyn post-punk outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30567-eraas/"" target=""_blank"">Eraas</a> takes the title of “Wash It Over” literally, submerging the track in a murky techno that slowly drowns the original to death. But the most spectacular revision here is the simplest, and it comes from the unlikeliest participant: Lynch, who reduces “Strange Formula” to a dirty, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"" target=""_blank"">PJ Harvey</a>-worthy blues with a tick-tock beat that summons an intensifying apocalyptic drone to swallow the song whole. Ultraísta’s synth-pop odysseys always sounded like they were begging for a more widescreen treatment-- who better to provide it than one of our greatest filmmakers?</p></div>"|18321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18321-ultraista-remixes/|6.8|Stuart Berman

That moment didn't last long, although the relationship has been somewhat rekindled here, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5389-eric-copeland/"">Eric Copeland</a> returns to DFA for the first time since his other band released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/752-broken-ear-record/""><i>Broken Ear Record</i></a> in 2005. The label's gone through vast changes in that time-- the dramatic curtain call of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a>, an acrimonious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37789-tim-goldsworthy-splits-with-dfa/"">split</a> with label co-founder Tim Goldsworthy-- but for Copeland things remain pretty much the same. In fact, it's possible that he's become even less proficient in the intervening years, choosing to un-learn as he goes. <i>Joke in the Hole</i> is his latest raggedy solo venture, essentially a series of samples and beats patched together so it manages to feel like both the best and worst drug experiences of your life all tied together in one woozy package.</p>
<p>Copeland has maintained a strong punk aesthetic over the years, choosing instinct over skill, divining thrills from crude, base forms. Even the cover art for <i>Joke in the Hole</i> looks like a copy of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys/"">Pet Shop Boys</a>' <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Introspective_(Pet_Shop_Boys_album).jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Introspective</i></a> that's been tossed into a 70s porn emporium. There's a lighter touch here than on most Black Dice records, with a fondness for pop forms weaved into the confusion. That's become a strain threaded through much of Copeland's solo work, coupled with a skill for combining humor and z-grade sleaze that positions him close to the feel of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000691/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Waters</a>' earliest films. Still, this is a subdivision of the world he creates in his other band, just one that has a little more logic to its rhythms. If Black Dice records often resemble a group of people furiously tossing around garbage, Copeland's solo work is the sound of him arranging the trash into pretty shapes.</p>
<p>Pitchfork's Marc Masters commented on how each release by Copeland has gotten ""more viscerally enjoyable"" in his review of 2012's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16799-limbo/"">Limbo</a></i>, and that continues here. ""Grapes"" is about as funky as he'll ever get, driven by a loop that resembles a flattened-out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29395-nile-rodgers/"">Nile Rodgers</a> guitar line that hilariously falls apart when extended to the point of disintegration. Copeland never exactly plays it straight, but there are moments on ""Bobby Strong"" and ""Cheap Treat"" where the obsession with degrading his source material lightens, closing in on the ultra-hectic rhythms of big beat. It's better when he's trying to assimilate the feel of a gut full of beer wobbling around on an impossibly hot day, which he does to wonderfully vomitous effect on ""Babes in the Woods"". If Copeland is interested in the conventions of clubland, it's at the point where someone’s puking on their shoes outside the venue, a distant throb of bass beating into their brain through the brickwork.</p>
<p>Copeland has always had a taste for the puerile-- Black Dice signed off from major labeldom last time out by constructing a cover collage that featured (among other things) the initials of the band scrawled over a naked, bent-over ass. Here, he dresses up his songs with titles like ""A Little Tit"" and ""New Leather Boogie"". DFA is even releasing an accompanying 12-inch to <i>Joke in the Hole</i> titled <i>Masterbater</i>. It might seem juvenile, or even wearying that he's still ploughing that seam after releasing records for so long. But it continues to fit perfectly well with what he's doing, which is essentially creating filthy, funny, non-dance music, all somewhat akin to filtering samples through the frivolous approach of an oompah band. Mostly it's like coming across a public-access channel late at night, where it never feels like the people on screen are fully in control. It works because Copeland isn't too rigidly stuck to his aesthetic, instead setting up his stall and letting the chaos pour in.</p></div>"|18254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18254-eric-copeland-joke-in-the-hole/|7.1|Nick Neyland

But it’s tricky to say where Dawn of Midi's new album <i>Dysnomia</i> fits within the jazz pantheon, if it even fits in there at all. Unlike their minimalist free jazz debut <i>First</i>, Dawn of Midi meticulously scripted and scored <i>Dysnomia</i>. For 46 continuous minutes, the trio inverts free jazz into bound jazz, torturing their instruments by playing as few notes as humanly possible. They write barely-there melodies that chase their own tails. They establish mercurial rhythms that are confusingly simple -- three humans dovetailing instrumental loops into thousands of subtly different permutations. It sounds close to an acoustic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28220-beak"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Beak&gt;</a> session playing a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Steve Reich</a> composition, though even closer to something totally unprecedented.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There’s been plenty of jazz groups that tried to reach out to the rock kids in recent years-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/532-the-bad-plus/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">The Bad Plus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2908-brad-mehldau"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Brad Mehldau</a> (both trios, incidentally) have shown up on the radar with covers of indie rock songs, though the covers feel more like like a bait and switch operations to get a wayward rockist into their more straight-ahead jazz charts. Unlike those groups, Dawn of Midi aren’t interested in coddling the uninitiated into the world of trading fours and Dmaj11 chords. On <i>Dysnomia</i>, they more interested in, or rather wholly focused on, rhythm. It's a new bridge out of traditional jazz to the rest of the world, and it's built with obsessive precision.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The pilgrimage begins with Aakaash Israni suggesting a tempo with two-note bass line. Then Amino Belyamani counters with one or two notes played with one hand while the other mutes the strings inside the body of the piano, making the piano melodies on <i>Dysnomia</i> sound more often like a thwack on a cymbal stand or some Eastern banjo. The polyrhythms of the bass and piano lap each other until Qasim Naqvi connects all the pulses on on the kit and, for a sustained moment, trio is in sync. And when they coalesce like this it’s so rewarding in that kind of pseudo-spiritual way, like when the tempo of the windshield wipers match up with the music in your car. But they all soon disengage and the three scatter off into new orbits at new speeds and prepare to align again.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This rubric that Dawn of Midi uses-- the lost and found, the tension and release-- has its closest cousins the digital world of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3170-orbital/"" target=""_blank"">Orbital</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1113-dj-shadow/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Shadow</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a>. The very real instruments on Dysnomia start to transform into breakbeats, ambient textures, a house hi-hat on “Nix”, all with gradual builds with a few “drops” here and there. With a sleek mix by Rusty Santos, who engineered Animal Collective’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/191-sung-tongs/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Sung Tongs</a></i> and mixed Owen Pallett’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13830-heartland"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Heartland</a></i>, it also shares more with these avant indie albums that used looped acoustic instruments to create free-form dance music-- the ""j-word"" has little to do with it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""> <i></i>The ultimate irony of <i>Dysnomia</i> is that by playing with musical restraint, they discover whole new avenues of sound that's focused on rhythm, dismantling jazz with the tools that built it. And while it may be closest in spirit to ambient electronica or American minimalism, it retains the tenor of a human, organic quest for something spiritual and transformative. Who knew a grand piano, a contrabass, and a drum kit could actually get people nodding their heads the same way a DJ could? Dawn of Midi’s first triumph isn’t just a sleeker <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Can</a>, or a more narcotic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Battles</a>, or a catnip for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a> fans who enjoy arguing whether or not <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2VzLn6DMCE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">“Pyramid Song”</a> is in 4/4. It’s not just a piano trio that’s subverting the tenets of jazz, either. It’s a missing link for two camps that have been diametrically opposed for years, speaking different musical languages and mostly failing to communicate. Guess no one ever thought to try to get the kids dancing.</p></div>"|18308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18308-dawn-of-midi-dysnomia/|7.9|Jeremy D. Larson

A lover readies himself for war, then dies in a battlefield, then is lowered into his grave a hero; the chorus goes, “And it’s good, it’s good… everybody knows it’s good.” Honey Ltd. play it so close to the chest that’s it’s hard to know just how to read the song nearly a half-century later. Is it a pro-war bromide, a corrective to the kneejerk pacifism of the late 1960s? Is the song counter-counterculture? That could be an intriguing perspective-- and certainly not an unusual one for the time.</p>
<p>The liner notes for <i>The Complete LHI Recordings </i>insist “The Warrior” is a “dark, angry, and wonderfully eloquent anti-war anthem.” In other words, the song, written by the group’s own Laura Polkinghome, is meant to be a wake-up call to a war-ready America, with air quotes around every “it’s good.” Intention, however, does not determine outcome, and Honey Ltd. don’t really have the interpretive skills to make “The Warrior” sound angry or accusatory or bitterly ironic. They make it sound too sincere and too sensual, which turn out to be their default settings. The four women fare better on less topical songs about romance gone sour, which are less ambitious yet more straightforward. <i>The Complete LHI Recordings</i> collects every song Honey Ltd. recorded for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1910-lee-hazlewood/"">Lee Hazlewood</a>’s imprint, which means it collects every songs they ever made. Even then it only adds up to 13 tracks, two of which are instrumentals. In other words, theirs is a story of a group only just getting started but never going anywhere.</p>
<p>Honey Ltd. formed in the mid 1960s in Detroit: four Wayne State co-eds who harmonized in the cafeteria and eventually dubbed themselves the Mama Cats. After gigging with Glenn Frey (later of the Eagles) and Bob Seger, they departed Motown for sunnier Los Angeles. You can hear that westward progression in their music, which mixes the polite sounds of Motown vocal groups with the much less formal folk-pop of the West Coast. This is what the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8548-the-crystals/"">Crystals</a> might have sounded like if they’d grown up in Laurel Canyon instead of Brooklyn. Or what the Mamas &amp; the Papas might have sounded like if there’d been no Papas.</p>
<p>After signing the group, Hazlewood changed their name to Honey Ltd. and shooed them into the studio, where he produced these 13 tracks over the course of a few months. As a result, there is a uniformity of sound here that belies the comp’s catchall nature, but Honey Ltd. are no Nancy Sinatra-- at least not at this early stage of their career. They can’t quite muster the romantic one-upmanship of “I’ve Got Your Man” and “No, You Are”, but they fare surprisingly well on the more psychedelic “For Your Mind” and “Silk 'n Honey”, with its acrobatic high notes. And then there’s the cover of “Louie Louie”, which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3091-jack-nitzsche/"">Jack Nitzsche</a> arranged at a slower tempo with an awkward, protracted coda. It’s faintly ridiculous, especially when Honey Ltd. get around to singing “me gotta go,” but those flashy horn blasts-- which sound 10 stories tall-- match the quartet's vocals much more astutely and naturally than all the acoustic and electric guitar that Hazlewood added to their production. It’s bold enough to make you wish they’d reteamed with Nitzsche again.</p>
<p>It turns out, however, that the group truly was anti-war. In 1968 they did a USO tour with Bob Hope, and their experience cemented their opposition to U.S. military presence in Vietnam. LHI did not share their outrage and persuaded the four singers to back off their stance. Once they bent to pressure, they broke. Alexandra Sliwin married JD Souther and left the group, and the remaining trio eventually disbanded. All that remains is a handful of songs and little in the way of a legacy. With so little of their promise realized, <i>The Complete LHI Recordings</i> works less as a piece of revelatory music than as a historical artifact: a curio from a different era of politics and pop culture. The truncated quality of their career gives this compilation a tragic sheen, though: Honey Ltd. obviously had ambitions to match their talents, but we can only wonder what they might have accomplished even with another 13 songs.</p></div>"|18318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18318-honey-ltd-the-complete-lhi-recordings/|5.9|Stephen M.

The darkness engulfing that band can be unnerving at times, but at least one of its members has found a way out. Ken Camden spends his time away from Implodes working on a solo career that demonstrates a fondness for sparse, repeating figures, all wrapped up in tracks described by his label as ""guitar/not guitar"" pieces. This is Camden's second solo album, following the similarly minded <i>Lethargy &amp; Repercussion</i> from 2010. The main difference on <i>Space</i> <i>Mirror</i> is a softer hew to the sound, which is laid out in a cottony expanse that largely replaces the sharper edges of his prior record. Mostly he's concerned with a form of balmy future gazing that falls in line with the kind of work <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"">Emeralds</a> once produced.</p>
<p>There's a strong air of nostalgia to Camden's music here, a hark back to the time when a kid could stare up at the night sky and dream of traveling to exotic purple planets. Camden chooses to let his imagination lead him through tracks that bring to mind towering ice palaces and blooming methane clouds. It's a thoughtful work, expertly put together, riddled with repetition but never to the point of boredom or distraction. He's as concerned with night terrors as he is with utopian dreams, setting ""Moon"" on a gradual course to destruction but letting ""Spectacle"" just stand there shimmering. Camden works best when there's a lack of motion, allowing tiny treated sounds to swell and fade, favoring a form of evolution that barely exists at all.</p>
<p>At times the playing is reminiscent of the point where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a> collapsed inward circa <i>Playing with Fire</i>, often recalling the scant, echoing guitar lines in the front end of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_WuHri_DFk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How Does It Feel?""</a>. That's some impressive company to keep, although Camden doesn't pull off the same affecting build of that song when he attempts something similar on ""Antares"". When he does favor journey over suspension he occasionally appears lacking in direction, heading off in his own peculiar orbit without appearing to have a clear idea of where he's going. <i>Space Mirror</i> mostly succeeds when Camden is out there marvelling at the enormity of it all, just taking in the view, lost in his own head. As such it's an appropriate soundtrack to the stalled space race, with human voyage perpetually spinning in place, left in the hands of astronauts who simply shuttle back and forth across a miniscule expanse of the universe.</p>
<p>Of course there's not much glamour in the thought of space travel being routine, unadventurous, and a rather unenlightening experience. That's certainly not what <i>Space Mirror</i> is about, even if its great circling motions now have more in common with the crushing workaday nature of space travel than they do with astronauts padding around the centrifuge of Discovery One in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i></a>. Camden's dreams are tilted in a more optimistic direction than the current state of things, albeit ones that are butting up hard against reality. It might explain the sadness dripping out of ""Dominic Sunset"", where the dream of a better world comes crashing down in a slow, agonizing fashion. At least he sometimes reaches a point of hope on <i>Space Mirror</i>. In a sense it does feel like he's that kid with a crumpled star chart in hand, picturing impossibly exotic worlds, fighting off the threat of disillusion with every turn he takes.</p></div>"|18300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18300-ken-camden-space-mirror/|6.2|Nick Neyland

One reason may be that their music, where intricate layers of effects-laden guitar build to cathartic crescendos, threatens to overshadow any but the hardiest onscreen action. It's all well and good for the colliding shoulder pads of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2880-friday-night-lights-ost/""><i>Friday Night Lights</i></a>, but harder to imagine as fodder for the subdued character beats of a <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0337773/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Gordon Green</a> film. Nevertheless, Explosions in the Sky have teamed up with fellow Austinite David Wingo, leader of indie rock band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5236-ola-podrida/"">Ola Podrida</a> and musical contributor to Green films such as <i>All the Real Girls</i>, to score <i>Prince Avalanche</i>, where two men repaint a wildfire-ravaged highway-- hardly a natural fit for starry guitar pyrotechnics.          </p>
<p>But Explosions in the Sky have been hunkered down in the extreme loud/soft dynamics of post-rock for almost 15 years now, and the consistency of their maximalist glare, which can only be done so many ways, makes it easy to overlook the area where they have shown real growth: the nuance of their softer side. Over the course of their discography, you can hear the band's interest shifting away from soaring peaks and toward the more finely textured valleys between them. On the <i>Prince Avalanche</i> OST, they get to delve into more microscopic composition without tacking on perfunctory climaxes. The result is a collection of emotive, melodious themes that makes for excellent around-the-house mood music. The band's diaphanous electric guitars are discerningly shaped in collaboration with Wingo, who understands how movie music sounds and also knows his way around a line of melodic counterpoint, as proven on Ola Podrida's excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17957-ola-podrida-ghosts-go-blind/""><i>Ghosts Go Blind</i></a> earlier this year.  </p>
<p>On <i>Prince Avalanche</i>, the enormous, trembling tremolo chords that usually hang like supernovas in Explosions' sky diffuse into a variety of subtler constellations, mostly made of acoustic guitar and piano in counterpoint with electric shimmers and hums. There are taut, crackling ambient pieces (""Fires"", ""Wading""). There are haunting e-bowed meditations, like the melody for saturated overtones on ""Theme from Prince Avalanche"" or the plaintive theme on ""Passing Time"", which recurs on later tracks to give the record its elegiac emotional center. There is a waltz (""Dear Madison""), an eloquently slow and sad flamenco-like tune (""Hello, Is This Your House?""), a misty piano interlude that wouldn't sound out of place on an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1334-eluvium/"" target=""_blank"">Eluvium</a> record. There are also a handful of more driving tracks, especially deep cuts ""Join Me on My Avalanche"" and ""Send Off"", where a subdued skyward gallop pays deference to the fans who have supported Explosions for so long. It's still questionable how this pretty, solemn music will work in the quirky context of Green's film, but it makes for a nice little album on its own.</p></div>"|18317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18317-explosions-in-the-sky-prince-avalanche-ost/|6.5|Brian Howe

Except lyrics videos generally don’t include lyrics that aren’t actually in the song. At the end, the Pleasure Masters crew sneaks in a pair of parentheticals: ""(The End.) (For Now.)"" It makes sense in context, a pulpy twist to match the song’s last line, and at the time a sneaky bit of meta-commentary: Pleasure Masters put the video up just as Annie was trying to free her sophomore album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13696-dont-stop-all-night-ep/"">Don’t Stop</a></i> from enough <a href=""http://www.scandipop.co.uk/pleasure-master/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Island Records red tape</a> to entangle it forever. (She left Island a few months prior and eventually got it released later in 2009.) And four years later, after the <i>Don’t Stop </i>cycle<i> </i>came to its own end (for then), it sounds more appropriate than ever.</p>
<p><i>A&amp;R</i>, Annie’s comeback EP, stands for Annie and Richard X (and, if you want to stretch the abbreviation, X’s longterm collaborator and onetime vocalist Hannah Robinson): the sole remaining personnel from her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/456-anniemal/"" target=""_blank""><i>Anniemal </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13696-dont-stop-all-night-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Don’t Stop </i></a>days. This isn’t necessarily a big aesthetic decision so much as Annie running out of viable ex-collaborators-- <i>Don’t Stop</i>‘s Paul Epworth’s subsequent work for a certain British upstart named <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"" target=""_blank"">Adele</a> has likely knocked him permanently into a different orbit, one where no matter when you read this he’s probably being asked for another “Rolling in the Deep”, and Xenomania lost vogue among British producers around when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5029-girls-aloud/"" target=""_blank"">Girls Aloud</a> did. (At least a few post-<i>Don’t Stop </i>Xenomania tracks are somewhere as vaporware, joining her previously announced <i>The Night Within Us! </i>EP.)</p>
<p>But it <i>sounds </i>like a big aesthetic choice. X and Robinson have been responsible for her best and best-known work-- “Chewing Gum”, “Songs Remind Me of You”, “I Know UR Girlfriend Hates Me”-- and more than that, Richard X’s become synonymous during his career with the sort of lush, nostalgic, house-tinged productions that make his core fanbase swoon. Which is the other half of the pun; the five tracks on <i>A&amp;R </i>match Annie to just the sort of repertoire the public’s demanding: danceable, but subtle enough to be positioned as a counterpoint to stadium EDM; nostalgic for the same strains of 90s pop house (X has <a href=""http://idolator.com/7474230/richard-x-annie-the-ar-ep-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cited</a> Telstar’s <i>Deep Heat </i>compilations as an inspiration) that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">Disclosure</a> and others have taken to the charts. She’s always done that-- <i>Anniemal</i> predicted what’s becoming a decade of slightly skewed blog-pop, and extragenre excursions like “Anthonio” have fit the revivals as well. And while there’s a cynical edge to a lot of this, Annie’s always made it come off like this is just what euphoria happens to sound like to her.</p>
<p>Or, as one might say, “you can lose yourself in the sound like it’s yesterday.” That’s the conceit of “Back Together”, as intoxicating a rush of meta-nostalgia as any that’s been set to music. Co-written by Victoria Hesketh of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26824-little-boots/"" target=""_blank"">Little Boots</a>, it’s such a dizzy trek through the best parts of <i>Nocturnes </i>that it’s shocking she didn’t keep it for herself. Unlike on the somewhat scattershot <i>Don’t Stop, </i>the collaborators and tangents on <i>A&amp;R </i>blend in seamlessly with the aesthetic: Robinson’s sparkling “Hold On”, which is like RAZE’s sampled “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPvditqs_U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Break 4 Love</a>” in a flurry of confectionery sugar, or closer “Mixed Emotions,” which works equally well as the crystalline bit of heartbreak on the dance floor that it is or the big-name remix you could assemble from the percussion breakdown and staccato synths underneath.</p>
<p>All of this could come off overly studied in the wrong hands, but <i>A&amp;R </i>fortunately preserves Annie’s most compelling aspect of all: her wink. “Invisible”, a sneaky grower of a rave-up, introduces another name to the credits: “Mannie”, Annie’s pitch-shifted impression of the loutish dude who wouldn’t call. It’s like a battle of the sexes performed by a woman and her club-mirror reflection, and it adds to the track’s po-faced regret something else: levity, frisson, maybe even empowerment. “Ralph Macchio”, meanwhile, really is what you suspect it is, which is a chirpy confession of love to the <i>Karate Kid</i> guy whose Google results have a Funny or Die hit in the first three results. (In the chorus: “Kiss me once and keep me forever, Ralph Macchio!” Not in the chorus: irony.) It’s by far the goofiest of Annie’s nostalgia plays (<a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2013/07/22/interview-annie/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">her other crush-that-was</a> was Joey McIntyre from New Kids On The Block.) But it <i>works</i>, because the production’s as earnestly ebullient as anything else on the record and because Annie’s a past master at taking goofy subjects and turning them into utterly believable pop: a suitor in a terrible garage-rock band (“I Don’t Like Your Band”), an agony aunt letter about a summer hookup (“Anthonio” again), the sentence “what do you want for breakfast?” deployed as a come-on (“The Breakfast Song”). It’s easy enough to pastiche up a house period piece; 15 people probably just finished one in Ableton. What’s harder to come by is a winning personality.</p></div>"|18316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18316-annie-the-ar-ep/|7.6|Katherine St. Asaph

Two years later, Kilfoyle enlisted producer Mark Verbos, an ex-pat of the Berlin electronic and techno scene, to flesh out songs Kilfoyle sketched at the East End of Long Island, where he had relocated to break a writer's block. The resulting <i>Tides End</i> follows a trajectory similar to Captured Tracks label mate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing/%20"">Wild Nothing</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18106-wild-nothing-empty-estate-ep/""><i>Empty Estate</i> EP</a>, trading vaporous guitars and indiscernible words for the bright, perky lines of new synthesizers and more defined song structures.</p>
<p>Despite Verbos' attempts to exorcise Kilfoyle's influences by making him listen to only <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7NLWQ2VKJM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Enigma</a> and Chicago house during the recording process, the old Minks that listened to Felt and recorded their first full-length in a basement studio still crop up occasionally on <i>Tides End</i>. ""Hold Me Now"" simmers with <i>Disintegration</i>-era synth tones (Kilfoyle claims <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">the Cure</a> are just a distant influence, but it's impossible not to notice consistent similarities between the two) and a muffled, insistent kick drum, tranquil guitar tones settling like gauze over the quieter spaces between the lyrics. Other moments that seem like a natural progression from <i>By the Hedge</i>-- the brooding bass and dream-pop phrasings of ""Playboys of the Western World,"" the heavy reverb that haunts ""Everything's Fine""-- are more subtle. For better or worse, Verbos mostly accomplished what he set out to do.</p>
<p>You can't blame Kilfoyle for wanting to move on, either. Much of <i>Tides End</i> might have been made as a reaction to the term ""lo-fi,"" a descriptor Minks has often been pegged with. ""It's funny when people describe Minks as lo-fi. To me, it's not very lo-fi at all,"" he said in <a href=""http://www.huhmagazine.co.uk/1479/minks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one interview</a>, and in <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2011/01/21/new-talent-minks/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">another</a>, ""Bedroom pop this is not."" Regardless of whether it is or it isn't, gone now are <i>By the Hedge</i>'s meandering six-string textures; now every sound is clearly demarcated, including Kilfoyle's voice, which is actually quite affecting once you can hear it. (It's also more noticeable in the absence of former Minks co-vocalist Amalie Bruun, who added to their debut's layered quality). That's probably the most redeeming part of <i>Tides End</i>, which overall suffers from the loss of Bruun and the ""wall of sound"" Kilfoyle so desperately wanted to leave behind.</p>
<p>Minks' vision goes awry from the beginning. Opener ""Romans"" is electro-pop at its most juvenile, topping a mewling synth line with a bouncy beat and the lyrics ""Happy birthday to the worst friend in the world."" ""Margot"" is a close second, galloping along at a double-time that's especially aggravating in light of Minks' earlier material, songs that did just fine as they took the time and space to arrive at their lovely, hazy conclusions. The rest of the tracks on <i>Tides End</i> aren't as bad as those two-- they aim for and, more often than not, hit a combination of Smithsian post-punk and the frothier parts of <i>Power, Corruption and Lies</i>-- but they're also not as good as they could be. While looking for something more immediate than <i>By the Hedge</i>, Kilfoyle seems to have forgotten that Minks' original, diaphanous guitar-driven melodies worked precisely because they were a little indefinable: they explored territory too subtle for a traditional pop song. Now that the veil has been lifted, there’s not much on <i>Tides End</i> worth the price of progress.</p></div>"|18319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18319-minks-tides-end/|5.9|Harley Brown

In that time, they’ve released three studio albums that have been generally lumped in with the Americana set, thanks primarily to their folksy harmonies and acoustic-based sound. Yet they’ve often bristled against the strictures of the roots scene, and the duo have indulged their taste for unabashedly pop hooks and moody soundscapes. In other words, they ought to be a perfect match for producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4314-jeff-tweedy/"">Jeff Tweedy</a>: As frontman for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a>, he certainly knows a thing or two about screwing around with folk-rock conventions, and as a helmer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13971-mavis-staples/"">Mavis Staples</a>, he has devised a recognizable sound that is playful yet artful, ambitious yet restrained. Furthermore, he has a long history with the Guthrie family, starting back in 1998 when he worked with Nora Guthrie to put music to some of her father <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14407-woody-guthrie/"">Woody</a>’s unrecorded lyrics. That incredibly fruitful project produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16518-the-complete-mermaid-avenue-sessions/"">three LPs’ worth</a> of strong material and launched a cottage industry of sorts. Sarah Lee is Nora’s niece and Woody’s granddaughter, which makes her the third generation of Guthries, living or dead, to work with Tweedy in some capacity.</p>
<p>With Wilco’s Patrick Sansone he co-produced Guthrie and Irion’s new record, <i>Wassaic Way</i>, but any expectations that artists and producers are well matched are immediately dispelled on the very first song, which is called “Chairman Meow”. Seriously. It’s a slice of tooth-decay meme-pop about a girl with a crib in Koreatown, a movie in production, and a cat with a clever name. Never mind that it’s impossible to determine if the song is parody or paean: it just sounds bad. Tweedy and Sansone turn the treble all the way up and the bass all the way down, which renders everything tinny and shrill. The drums plod along, the fuzz guitar fizzes like a child’s toy, the voices take on a pre-adolescent pitch. It all sounds juvenile.</p>
<div><i>Wassaic Way</i> could be a sequel to Guthrie's 2009 children's album, <i>Go Waggaloo</i>. While there's nothing wrong with targeting the pre-K set (check out Tweedy's version of Woody's ""Hoodoo Voodoo"" for proof), there is something alienating about treating adult listeners like children. Whether attempting upbeat power pop or nestling into a saccharine ballad, these songs are persistently coy and cloying, with lyrics about butterflies and trick-or-treat that habitually mistake platitudes for insights. ""How are we here? What are we made of?"" Guthrie asks on ""Circle of Souls. ""Now the dream is clear, so what are we afraid of?"" It sounds lofty and portentous, but ultimately sacrifices meaning for rhyme. </div>
<p>Despite-- or, perhaps, due to-- Guthrie and Irion’s long history as bandmates and spouses, their voices go together all too well. One is cake, the other icing: both are uniformly sugary, but they do the same thing, set the same tone, and convey the same emotions in exactly the same way. There’s no contrast between them, therefore no tension or conflicts in these songs. Surprisingly, they sound better when they sing solo, as on “Circle of Souls” or “Not Probably Gone”. Even more surprisingly, they sound best at their most conservative, when they settle into songs modestly rooted in a quaint country sound, like “Still Dreaming” or the harmonica-drenched title track. It's pleasant enough-- not exactly memorable but also not actively off-putting to a grown-up listener.</p></div>"|18348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18348-sarah-lee-guthrie-johnny-irion-wassiac-way/|4.5|Stephen M.

It’s exhilarating to see talented, hardworking people take those first steps out of the practice room and into the world armed with only a handful of riffs and ambition. Sometimes it takes awhile, and sometimes the rewards come fast. The excellent Oakland death doom quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31425-lycus/"" target=""_blank"">Lycus</a> have taken the latter path. Their first release, 2011’s <a href=""http://theflenser.bandcamp.com/album/demo-mmxi-remastered"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Demo MMXI</i></a>, made the rounds quietly, catching underground attention with three gutted paeans simmering beneath a stark, skeletal Bryan Proteau cover. It felt raw and honest, and captured the imagination in a way that’s rarely seen from metal’s extreme outliers. On <i>Tempest</i>, their first proper album, and first for 20 Buck Spin, the rough edges have been sanded down, and the light shines through.</p>
<p>Often used interchangeably with ""death doom,"" funeral doom is more accessible than the most perverse, impenetrable corners of black metal, death, and grind, but don’t be fooled-- the punishing lengths, torturously slow tempos, and disquieting emotional heft it offers still inflict plenty of damage. Those who enter into the darkest depths of this suicidal subsect are asked to abandon all hope, and given little choice in the matter. Lycus approach the void carefully. Though they’ve had the funeral doom tag lobbed at them already, it’s not entirely accurate: 11 minute songs do not a funeral doom band make, and Lycus show no interest in following genre conventions. They refrain from histrionic, death-worshipping self-hatred and instead embrace a more cosmic, organic take on sorrow. Given their Bay Area lineage, it’s not hard to connect the dots and see that their proximity to like-minded acts Asunder, Graves At Sea, and Noothgrush has made an impact.</p>
<p>Their approach eschews the classic European emphasis on keyboards and overly flowery gothic influence, focusing instead on the sludgier, more straightforward sound that American bands often gravitate towards. Think Samothrace, not Skepticism. Opening dirge “Coma Burn” sets the tone down low, with rumbling vocals and ominous chords. Their penchant for tremolo (as heard on the effortlessly, engagingly dynamic “Engravings”) speaks of a faint black metal influence, one that intensifies into mania during the epic closing track.  After the listener is taken through peaks and valleys of howling black metal, slavering sludge, and contemplative doom, “Tempest” lets us down gently, fading out in a gentle blur of noise. Punctuated by mournful violins, each of the album’s three compositions flows beautifully into the next, allowing for a force of movement seldom seen within the style. Melancholia reigns, yet there is no gnashing of teeth or soot-smeared wails permeating the monolithic riffs. They are better than that. Lycus have entered the next stage of mourning with this release, and their early stages of grief have matured into dignified resignation and graceful acceptance.</p></div>"|18224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18224-lycus-tempest/|7.9|Kim Kelly

Red Red Meat was on the road behind their minor masterpiece <i>Bunny Gets Paid</i>, while Rex, a slowcore band that included drummer Doug Scharin, also of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18712-codeine/"" target=""_blank"">Codeine</a>, was promoting their self-titled debut on Southern Records. The bands had some things in common: both could be very subtle and focused on details, letting space do a lot of work, and both were steeped in the history of American music and ready to bend the textures and songs of the past to their own, more postmodern, ends. The joint record was recorded by Chicago mainstay Bundy K. Brown and Red Red Meat sonic mastermind Brian Deck and the sessions were described as loose and improvisatory. The resulting record, <i>Loftus</i>, wouldn’t be released until 2000, by which time both original bands were no longer. To say that initial issue of the album didn’t get around would be an understatement. I know many serious fans of Red Red Meat and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/651-califone/"" target=""_blank"">Califone</a> (the Tim Rutili-led band band RRM transitioned into) who have never heard of it. It seemed somehow appropriate that this artifact, which sounded like something that been pulled out from underneath a rotting log, would fade away. But now it returns with this carefully assembled vinyl/digital reissue. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Though I listened to Rex a bit at the time, I’ve always considered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2508-loftus/"" target=""_blank"">Loftus</a> firmly as a Red Red Meat side project, in part because this record sound so clearly like a step in their steady evolution from a blues-obsessed grunge band to a noisy avant-folk group exploring the concept of studio-as-instrument. There was a glorious tension in their work during the 1990s, as they followed their muse in what seems like opposite directions but found a way to make them meet in the middle. On the one hand, they were exploring deep blues and rustic folk from the dawn of recorded history, finding inspiration in the old, weird America and used as a springboard for the acoustic experimentation in music a few years later (every generation, it seems, hears something new in the<i> Anthology of American Folk Music</i>). But they were also keeping abreast of rapidly changing technology, using sequencers, computers, and loops to give their music a mechanized clang that, in the most distant way, owed something to industrial-leaning dance music. So you had ancient song structures and modern technology working in tandem to create music that sounded remarkably new. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The Loftus record found these experiments happening at the hazier end of the spectrum. The album alternates proper songs with instrumental interludes that feel more like sketches but somehow, the patchy nature of the album as a whole works to its advantage. So a track like the banjo-led instrumental “Theme From Loftus Nine”, which sets a simple chord projection over wafts of organ and feedback, accumulates its power in the context of the whole. On one side of it you have “King Carp in a Dan Ryan Ditch”, which consists of looped fragments of delicate sound that are eventually obliterated by crashing drums that sound like a hammer beating on the side of an empty boxcar, and on the other side you have “Nervous”, a taut, bass-driven instrumental filled with creeping menace. These abstract tracks wash over like a half-remembered dream and contribute to the sense of the album as a place, something you sink into for 40 minutes. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But there are some fantastic songs mixed in with the drones and creaks, and the juxtaposition of the two is what really makes the record. “Haywine” begins with one of the eeriest blues riffs I’ve heard, as single notes of palpable texture are bent into a gorgeously expressive shape, and the song that emerges from the fog, the voice processed to a half-dead gurgle, expresses a rare sense of downcast weariness. “Stolen From a Rifle Clean Brothel” is a bracingly simple upbeat blues, just acoustic guitar, a bass, and a bit of cheesy organ, and has the dank tossed off-brilliance as the third side of <i>Exile on Main Street</i>, the sort of thing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"" target=""_blank"">Royal Trux</a> was also nailing around this time. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The cover of <i>Loftus</i> shows an image of a jawbone on a tan background, which, on both the CD issue and (big respect for going this extra mile) the LP reissue, is made of sandpaper. When it sits on the shelf, if you don’t keep it in a plastic sleeve, the abrasion of this sleeve will slowly and steadily wear on the record next to it, scuffing it leaving its mark. <i>Loftus</i> itself is a slowly burning thing, a record that both evokes the march of time and, here and there, seems to stop it. Late in the album comes “Penguin Boy's Love Story”, quite possibly the most beautiful song Tim Rutili has written, an achingly sad slow dance that is like a half-speed Santo &amp; Johnny’s “Sleepwalk” mixed with harmonized voices sung by a quartet of ghosts. “This is where we’ll come for water,” goes the refrain, expressing the elemental feel of record that deserves another chance to be heard. </p></div>"|18293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18293-loftus/|8.4|Mark Richardson

It’s a quality that’s embedded right in her name: “Kyary” is the closest Japanese-language approximation of the Western name “Carrie,” which her high school classmates teased her with when they thought she was dressed in a too typically “American” style. (She added the “Pamyu Pamyu” part just because she thought it sounded good.)</p>
<p>Her fashion sense isn’t the only element that makes Kyary such a Western-oriented artist, but it explains some of it. Before she began her musical career two years ago she was a hardcore harajuku girl who managed to flip her sartorial instincts into a career as a fashion blogger and model, and even released her own signature line of fake eyelashes. It’s a far more independent, entrepreneurial backstory than most J-pop artists, who tend to be plucked out of obscurity by managers who mold them with factory precision to a prespecified blueprint before they’re introduced to their audience.</p>
<p>The video for her 2011 debut single, “PonPonPon”, introduced viewers to a Kyary Pamyu Pamyu aesthetic that was already fully formed, a hyperkinetic pileup of lysergically vivid Japanese design sensibilities and American pop culture detritus-- a literal pile of garishly colored, mostly plastic stuff including a giant box of Kraft mac &amp; cheese, creepy stuffed animals, and a Green Bay Packers “cheesehead” hat. It also established Kyary as a multimedia artist along the lines of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"" target=""_blank"">Lady Gaga</a>, whose aesthetic instincts are strong enough that she’s allowed to scribble way outside of the lines most pop stars have to operate within. Along with the kawaii props and posing there’s a dancing woman in a full-face stocking mask (who seems to be a man in drag) and at one point the video’s star farts a beam of strobing abstract computer graphics.</p>
<p><i>Nanda Collection</i>, her second LP and first to be officially released in the U.S., continues in the direction that “Ponponpon” established, which is to say it feels like a face-first dive into a Takashi Murakami painting. Its unrelenting Day-Glo anime psychedelia isn’t for everyone, and the level of constant overstimulation it maintains throughout its running time on could probably trigger a panic attack in more sensitive listeners.</p>
<p>If you can handle the barrage of synthesizer marching bands, PS1-era video game noises, and Kyary’s overwhelming kawaii-ness, <i>Nanda Collection</i> is a fascinating listen. It’s very much a J-pop record, with the requisite synth-pop and smooth disco numbers that entails, along with a jazzy piano flourish here and there, but it frequently breaks from the form’s conventions. Its first single, “Invader Invader”, is essentially a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3529-the-rapture/"" target=""_blank"">Rapture</a>-style dance punk track rendered in candy-colored electronics, at least until the part where it turns into a synth emulation of a metalcore breakdown mixed with a dubstep drop. Halfway through the straightforward-seeming “Fashion Monster”, the song’s high speed bubblegum melts down into a psychedelic drone for a minute before swerving back.</p>
<p>Like Murakami, Kyary’s take on kawaii has a weird, sinister edge to it, and she seems to enjoy keeping her audience slightly unsettled. For instance she’s fond of painting over her real mouth with oversized, distorted mouths that are cartoony but also freakish-- a grotesque mutation to put a strange spin on her overwhelmingly cute image. She does something similar musically, and at times <i>Nanda Collection</i> feels almost like a twisted parody of J-pop, with overclocked tempos that are just a little too fast, and the usual cheery mood amplified to a discomfiting level. “Kurakura” feels downright malevolent, alternating between lurching oompah-band circus music and Kyary’s multi-tracked voice chanting “kura kura” over and over while a glockenspiel repeats a maddeningly dissonant figure, and overall it sounds like Danny Elfman at his most intentionally nightmarish.</p>
<p>Despite years of predictions that J-pop’s big American break is just around the corner, it still seems supremely unlikely to happen. The style’s earnestly upbeat mood isn’t edgy enough for American tastes, and for the most part we aren’t interested in foreign pop culture. The odds of Kyary finding a mass audience here seem slim, but not exactly zero. She’s already found an audience outside the usual Japanophile consumers, specifically a cultish following of Tumblr users who look up to her twisted interpretation of kawaii, and it’s not unimaginable that she could find some fans in the mainstream. She’s already breaking most of J-pop’s rules and traditions. What’s one more?</p></div>"|18369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18369-kyary-pamyu-pamyu-nanda-collection/|6.6|Miles Raymer

The duo, who started dating right around their band's formation, refer to Soft Metals albums as “works being commissioned” and stand apart from their boy-girl synth contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28702-kisses/"" target=""_blank"">Kisses</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1728-glass-candy/"" target=""_blank"">Glass Candy</a>, simply because their electronic compositions are several shades darker, stalking around ominously on the back of churning keyboards and drum machines, often without any discernable hook or cathartic crescendo. Their self-titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15681-soft-metals/"" target=""_blank"">2011 debut album</a> had flashes of poppier aspirations amidst the busy distorted breakbeats and murky bedroom production, but those moments were almost always subverted by Hall’s ethereal, distant vocals and unnervingly detached lyrical persona.</p>
<p>For their latest album <span><i>Lenses</i>, </span><span>Hall and Hicks relocated from Portland to Echo Park, setting up a home studio after failed attempts to write and record in a professional space. Like their self-titled debut, they worked through the new material by participating in extended improvised jam sessions, shaping and editing the new batch of songs from long dirges of chugging krautrock rhythms set to the Teutonic tick of an 808 drum machine. But </span><i>Lenses</i><span> dives deeper into the hallucinogenic soundscapes from their previous work via subtraction; instead of pushing toward more pop inflected compositions and building off the moments of melody from their previous album, they've pared down their work, focusing on the hypnotic depths of the repetitive synthesizer movements and brittle keyboards of Kraftwerk and John Carpenter’s classic movies scores. The production allows most of the tracks’ spartan compositions to reverberate in cavernous expanses of space, while Hall’s ghostly voice waxes dreamy poetics about the doors of perception and altered states of consciousness.</span></p>
<p>Hall’s heady lyrical abstractions were inspired, in part, by a moment of clarity she reached during a mushroom and ecstasy fueled dance party. “<span>We'd be there for 10 hours dancing and then I start seeing cave paintings on the wall,” Hall told me when I interviewed her for <i>Paper</i>. “It made me think of how this couldn't be very different from what prehistoric people were doing. They were gathering, and dancing around a fire, listening to this primitive music and having these really incredible experiences connecting with one another.”</span><span> But while Hall and Hicks’ aspiration to explore weighty philosophical ruminations through their impressionistic songwriting is an interesting goal, the results are more admirable than listenable.</span></p>
<p>This is pretty evident on <span><i>Lenses</i>’</span><span> title track, which attempts to create an abstract patchwork of synth arpeggios, but never quite congeals into a coherent enough piece to merit attention. That, and Hall’s vocal work here is marred by an unflattering harmony and cringe-worthy, sophomore philosophy major's lyrics: “Breaking through my perception of you/ Breaking through my concept of life/ Breaking through what the mirror reflects/ Breaking through the way that I move.” “Tell Me” does a much better job working out the rhythmic dimensions that Hall and Hicks seem to be striving for, pulsing from a spiraling synthesizer riff and four-on-the-floor beat as Hall sings breathy lyrics that are alluring in their sensual crypticism (“Tell me/ Has this come true?”), while staying much closer to the central melody than she did to worse effect on “Lenses”. On the occasions Soft Metals inch nearer to pop songcraft, like they do with the bass-heavy R&amp;B light show of “On a Cloud” or the arty melodrama of “No Turning Back”, the results are surprisingly effective, especially considering the ways in which the duo’s penchant for breakneck cyclical synth patterns augment their prettiest harmonies with a paranoid sense of unease.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>In the end,</span><i> Lenses</i><span> comes off like a proggy, synth pop album that wants to get treated like sound sculpture, but Soft Metals don't fully commit to either endeavor in spite of the record's handful of successes. Regardless, they've admirably carved out their own corner of the electro world; Hall and Hicks are determined to make challenging, cerebral EDM and have more on their minds <span>than the placement of the next drop.</span></span></p></div>"|18340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18340-soft-metals-lenses/|6.0|Patrick Bowman

Consider <i>Forestelevision</i>,<i> </i>the third album by Seattle quartet <a href=""http://lesbian.bandcamp.com/music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lesbian</a>. Across one 44-minute track, the band manages to move without pause from aching funeral doom to arching classic thrash, from acid-washed electric jazz to acrobatic prog-rock, from ambling stoner rumble to assailant death metal. And that’s merely a sample. <i>Forestelevision </i>is the shortest Lesbian album to date, respectively clocking in at 20 and 30 minutes less than 2007’s <i>Power Hor</i> and 2010’s <i>Stratospheria Cubensis</i>. But its series of suites, starts, stops, misdirections, and redirections makes for their most audacious and zealous LP. It feels wide-eyed and enthusiastic, too, as if played by kid prodigies out in the garage, recreating every new heavy sound they hear. That is the awesome part.</p>
<p>But <i>Forestelevision</i> stumbles toward awful when its music moves beyond the theoretical-- you know, when you actually listen to the thing. Lesbian pilfer genres that tend to deliver all-consuming experiences, whether that’s the steady <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a>-style quakes that open <i>Forestelevision </i>or the warped krautrock fantasies that soon follow. But Lesbian is too distracted and too focused on showing us that they <i>can</i> swivel between all these styles for this single song to ever whisk away its audience. Just past the halfway mark, for instance, they enter a particularly technical passage that flips between iron-fisted math metal and brief psych-rock washouts, with onyx, hoarse vocals inlaid through it all. Listening to the section by itself, it’s easy to hear how <i>good</i> Lesbian is as a band. Listening to it as part of <i>Forestelevision</i>’s 44 minutes, however, it simply recalls the part of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4832-girl-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Girl Talk</a> album where it just becomes too much, where the obsession with an inundation of so many parts gets stupid and masturbatory. This is a very long song, sure, but you almost want Lesbian to take it slower, or at least to take less of it. They can’t sit still, meaning the listener can’t settle in.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that <i>Forestelevision</i> is a complete waste. In lieu of offering a sample track from the album, as it consists of only one track, <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2013/04/stream-lesbian-forestelevision-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lesbian doled out edits of their 44-minute monster</a> in the weeks leading up to its release. Those digestible samples worked better than the full course, turns out, showcasing the range of the group without overwhelming by virtue of it. The merry-go-round ballet between piercing guitars and calliope keyboards is exhilarating in 10-minute bursts, as is the NWOBHM supremacy that lords over the album’s end. But continuously listening from one <i>Forestelevision </i>highlights to another is a task best left to the masochistic. What’s more, for all its stylistic gumption, <i>Forestelevision</i> is generally clumsy and awkward with jarring fusions and fumbled handoffs. Lesbian’s ideas are bigger than their ability to arrange them, only exacerbating the feeling of unease.</p>
<p>The future seems precarious for Lesbian after making a record like <i>Forestelevision</i>. This album is a grand idea that they’re just not yet good enough to pull off. Sure, they more than pass muster technically, even when Dorando Peter Hodous’ chameleonic vocals get swallowed by the sounds that surround him. But the net effect of the record is that of joyless sex or sports practice-- something that’s trudged through because it’s always suggestive of a better, more fulfilling version of itself. That doesn’t mean Lesbian can’t make something like this compelling. With some heavy edits and rewritten transitions, and with production that allows for space between these sardine-packed parts, <i>Forestelevision </i>or its successors might actually work. So what’s next: Do they try such a stunt again, committing themselves as composers charged with making each subsequent symphony a bit better than the one before it? But is that limiting and redundant? Or do they retreat toward previous iterations and make an album that bites off a bit less with each track? And does that qualify as defeat? Maybe, but then again, so does an album that so adamantly wants to be awesome it actually becomes awful.</p></div>"|18093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18093-lesbian-forestelevision/|5.0|Grayson Currin

During its sole, 38-minute track, the dozen-member ensemble led by J.R. Robinson builds from asymptotic silence into space-age electroacoustic drone, and from browbeating doom metal into, ultimately, a circular, harp-flecked denouement. Within Robinson’s magnetic musical current, the distance from beer-soaked rock club to incense-scented yoga studio is but one quick fadeout.</p>
<p>That notion is backed up by the varied personnel he recruited for this massive instrumental beauty: Jef Whitehead-- better known as Wrest, of U.S. black metal belligerents <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5778-leviathan/"" target=""_blank"">Leviathan</a>-- adds drums, while seasoned studio musician and distinguished improviser Fred Lonberg-Holm plays cello; there’s viola from Julie Pomerleau, a musician with a wealth of indie rock experience, and electronics from high-tone harsh noise priest Mark Solotroff. It’s an unlikely crew, the sort of experts-in-their-field assembly that you expect to be financed by a major label. Instead, it was simply fostered by the musical diversity of Chicago. But <i>You’ve Always Meant So Much to Me</i> doesn’t fit conveniently into any of its makers’ scenes-- noise or post-rock, metal or classical-- because it falls too far into other scenes into which it doesn’t completely fit, either. Doom or drone, new age or space rock? That barely matters: <i>You’ve Always Meant So Much to Me</i> is a terrific monument of simultaneous stylistic acceptance and avoidance.</p>
<p>Robinson constructed this music as the score for a film of the same name, shot from a rooftop in Long Island City, in the desert of Joshua Tree, and in the urban ruins of Detroit. “It’s a classic example of structural filmmaking, where the camera does all of the work for you,” he recently <a href=""http://www.chicagomusic.org/blog/interview-wrekmeister-harmonies#.Ucs8mKU5TGN"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a>. “There were long, static shots... Nature doing its thing to nature, and nature doing its thing to man.” Such a sense of vulnerability and predictability define this piece, in part because its direction and structure are at once obvious and enthralling-- that is, nearly as soon as it starts, you know exactly where it’s going, but hearing the process itself develop is still captivating.</p>
<p>Here, Wrekmeister Harmonies feels like a stateside, kid-friendly answer to Australia’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3095-the-necks/"" target=""_blank"">the Necks</a>. A gentle bell peal opens <i>You’ve Always Meant So Much to Me</i>, serving as an invocation for the electronic hum and patchwork of phrases and patterns that follow. Upright bass skips along in deep zigs and zags, while shouts and hisses shoot through the space like errant asteroids. A harp traipses. A harmonium howls. A viola weeps. All these sounds grow together for the first 22 minutes or so, gathering eventually into the same great post-rock swell that you might’ve predicted at the track’s beginning. And then it all crashes down, with Whitehead hammering the drums in mid-tempo wrath, evacuating the air beneath distorted guitars and tidal strings and saturating electronics. With the dependability of the setting sun, the beating stops eight minutes later, giving way to an extended trickle back toward silence. Again, the end result, like the middle, is predictable, but the path toward it is both engrossing and wonderful all the same. Wrekmeister Harmonies use familiar elements from Neu! and Neurosis, free jazz and Swans to offer a compass within a sometimes disorienting patchwork of sound. To further facilitate that navigation, Robinson employees a traditional format-- quiet, louder, loudest, quieter-- to let you know where you’re going, just not how you’ll get there.</p>
<p>There’s a temptation to talk about records such as <i>You’ve Always Meant So Much to Me</i> as proof that heavy metal is itself going places, getting smarter and becoming more adventurous. Wrekmeister Harmonies, one could suggest, stands in the midst of some advancing experimental frontier. And, sure, fans of the liminal heaviness of Sunn O))), Earth, Locrian or those that have used volume and riffs to push outside of metal’s confines will likely want to slip inside of Robinson’s protracted rise and fall here. But Robinson’s work feels too personal to be part of any movement, too centered on the intricacies of its own action to be concerned with anyone else’s activities. Its intentionality feels entirely internal, like a deep and calming breath that just happens to be exhaled in the same direction in which the wind is blowing.</p></div>"|18263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18263-wrekmeister-harmonies-youve-always-meant-so-much-to-me/|7.9|Grayson Currin

At the forefront of that scene are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/195-apparat/"" target=""_blank"">Apparat </a>(aka Sascha Ring) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2978-modeselektor/"" target=""_blank"">Modeselektor</a> (the duo of Gernot Bronsert and Sebastian Szary), and their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12959-moderat/"" target=""_blank"">2009 album</a> as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27653-moderat/"" target=""_blank"">Moderat</a> was a massive, supergroup-level event for a very, very particular kind of electronic music fan.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>After several productive years apart, the trio has reconvened for a second full-length. Four years is a long time in the fast-moving dance music world (more than enough time for whole genres to bloom, wither, and die), but Ring, Bronsert, and Szary have picked up pretty much exactly where they left off. The major differences between <i>II</i> and their self-titled debut is that their sonic sensibilities have grown more refined and compelling, and that the world has just about caught up to them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Luckily the album’s weakest moment comes early on, and is therefore quickly dealt with. “Bad Kingdom”, <i>II</i>’s first song after a brief intro, has a wicked instrumental bed with a sparse breakbeat drum part and growling sawtooth synths-- if it had been released a few months earlier, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a> might have sampled it on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus</i></a> somewhere. But it’s topped by a vocal that’s afflicted with the kind of generic Euro-soul inflection that American ears have a hard time dealing with, and the juxtaposition between the aggressive synths and airy pop vocals weakens the former rather than creating an interesting contrast.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Things pick up after that. The trio seem intent on exploring (and blurring) the line some electronic music fans draw between “dancefloor listening” and “headphone listening.” They favor unhurried tempos, and tend to emphasize texture over melody, but it’s not simply chill-out music either. “Let in the Light” runs at considerably lower BPM than the average peak-hour banger, but the echo-laden-yet-punchy drums, swelling synth chords, and a far stronger vocal melody than the one on “Bad Kingdom” make it easy to imagine how it could provide an amped-up crowd going off to it if the right DJ was daring enough to drop it in a mix.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The album peaks right around its midpoint with the track “Milk”, which over 10 minutes evolves from the barest rhythmic sketch embellished with a few ambient sounds into an swarm of pulsing synths drifting in clouds of white noise, the whole time repeating one brief melodic line that somehow gets more compelling the more it repeats. It lacks the hard edges and aggressive drive that most big-room rave anthems are built from, but it’s still precisely engineered to produce the same kind of world-shaking late night epiphany.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Moderat</i> was a peculiar sounding album at the time. Outside of dubstep and a burgeoning drum &amp; bass revival, breakbeats weren’t really in fashion, and some of the songs were structured like pop songs and boasted pop vocal parts but were still sonically rooted in the sounds of the electronic fringe. Since then a two-step renaissance has bubbled up out of the remnants of the underground dubstep scene and spread throughout dance music, and as pop radio moves increasingly EDM-ward listeners have made weird synthesized sounds de rigueur in the mainstream. So <i>II</i> is just about perfectly synchronized with the zeitgeist, and if it’s not a flawlessly executed record, it still seems capable of making the most out of its moment.</span></p></div>"|18315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18315-moderat-ii/|7.4|Miles Raymer

It’s strange <i>Crystal World </i>is billed as Helen Marnie, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2408-ladytron/"" target=""_blank"">Ladytron</a>’s lead vocalist, but between returning producer Daniel Hunt (as well as Keren Ann collaborator Bardi Johannsson) and the downcast synthscapes he creates, it’d be believable as a successor to 2011’s relatively sedate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15803-gravity-the-seducer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Gravity the Seducer</i></a>, which wasn’t as zeitgeisty as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4635-the-witching-hour/"" target=""_blank""><i>Witching Hour</i></a> but hardly obscure. It’s a bit of a curiosity: an <a href=""http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/marnie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admitted pop move</a> that makes no plays at a pop audience and that’s mostly midtempo, like a Ladytron album composed entirely of their ballads. Even the title sounds closed off.</p>
<p class=""p1"">What’s striking is how even an album so insular in distribution and in sound, is nevertheless conversant with trends; a surprising number of boxes get checked. Single “The Hunter”, the most Ladytron-like track here, is a rippling bit of Moroder by Hunt; if it weren’t for the gentle lilt or <i>Witching Hour </i>melody of the chorus, it could be anyone’s sequencer mania. Vaguely political “Sugarland” is the kind of 80s pop ballad with swooning backing vocals that everyone’s trying to write this year, backed with the shoegazey guitars and synths they’ve tried to reproduce for longer. There’s a slightly sullied chanson in “Violet Affair”, a reverb-swept song named “Laura” about someone close enough to Laura Palmer (after a dye job here, but demise and affairs intact), a sprawling, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>-ish set closer in “Hearts on Fire” (which doesn’t actually close <i>Crystal World</i>; the sequencing is a bit off).</p>
<p class=""p1"">But while <i>Crystal World’s</i> material is generally strong, and timely enough, as an album it’s a subdued entry.<i> </i>Ladytron’s best albums worked because Mira Aroyo’s tracks provided a steelier, tenser contrast to Marnie’s more plainspokenly ethereal sound. (This was part of the problem with <i>Gravity the Seducer, </i>all Marnie and all sedate.) Without a second voice, an album like this needs at least one standout single all the more; but while Marnie was responsible for those in Ladytron, there’s no “Destroy Everything You Touch” or “Ghosts” here. The closest is “The Hunter”, whose charms, while many, are muted; or “High Road"", which is like Ladytron covering “Tainted Love” with a few riffs from “Like a Virgin”-- but not nearly as massive as that sounds; the production is far too diffident (one wonders what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"" target=""_blank"">NIN</a> and <i>Velocifero’s</i> Alessandro Cortini would have done with it) and the chorus hinges on “do you believe in love or rock and roll,” a lyric that’d be more convincingly delivered by basically anyone else.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If <i>Crystal World</i> isn’t a one-off, there are basically two ways Marnie can go. She could double down on the big synthpop singles and thus launch herself into a fast-crowding field, or-- perhaps more promising-- pursue the witchier, mythier direction suggested by “The Wind Breezes On” and “Submariner”, as haunting and crystalline as Marnie’s best material and better matches for her florid lyricism. Fortunately, if she does, these tend to be just the sort of detours less rewarded by the hype cycle than by patrons. Those, at least, Marnie has plenty of.</p></div>"|18344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18344-helen-marnie-crystal-world/|6.3|Katherine St. Asaph

For a decade, the Ohio band has largely been ghettoized to cult status, familiar to Midwestern kids or those paying more than casual attention to what’s clumsily called “post-metal,” at least post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"" target=""_blank"">Isis</a>. Between 2004 and 2008, Mouth of the Architect released three rather convincing-- if sometimes haphazardly indulgent-- records of unified doom and grace. Dependent upon extreme dynamics and grand composition, with track lengths that ticked into the teens and albums that stretched past the hour mark, Mouth of the Architect seemed like a natural recipient of the same “brainy metal” laurels then distributed by outlets as illustrious as <i>The New York Times</i>.</p>
<p>But the ascendance never came, and since 2008’s teetering <i>Quietly</i>, the band instead lingered at the threshold of self-destruction. They released an EP in 2010, but, as <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2013/06/mouth-of-the-architect-dawning/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a revealing Invisible Oranges look</a> into the band’s last half-decade suggests, they mostly tried not to die-- as a group, really, or as people. “Some of us were convinced that the end was coming, either the big picture or individually,” drummer Dave Mann told Brad Sanders. “Some of us, me in particular, were in a downward spiral in a lot of ways.”</p>
<p>The appropriately titled new album <i>Dawning</i> is their first in five years and their first featuring bassist Evan Danielson. It’s also their best work to date, a fully realized resurrection. <i>Dawning</i> showcases a band that now moves with an intricacy and immediacy that indicate just what Mouth of the Architect is: a veteran group comprising members with long résumés, who’ve now gotten a chance to begin again and know what to do with it. A wonder of tension and release, <i>Dawning</i> is designed to throw listeners into tailspins and, then, to lift them above the mess. That drama not only reflects the survival of the band that stuck around long enough to make this album but also of a group that’s now pushed past the cloister of post-metal: Despite the hardened visage of tough-guy screams, burly guitar tones, and Mann’s aggressive drumming, <i>Dawning </i>is a compulsively <i>likable </i>record, full of anthems meant for memorizing and environments meant for immersion. (Hell, “Sharpen Your Axes” could pass for millennial Incubus.) If you’ve ever liked Isis there’s plenty for you here; on the other hand, if you like, say<i>, Abbey Road-- </i>or any music that tries to outstrip the structure of a single song while not abandoning its magnetism-- <i>Dawning</i> deserves your time, too.    </p>
<p>Should the metal prefixes “progressive” or even “post-“ suggest long-winded, self-invested excursions nestled within songs that require an almanac, scrap the notion for <i>Dawning</i>. Yes, these songs stretch between seven and 11 minutes each, but even the longest, centerpiece “How This Will End"", hinges upon narrative thrust and musical selflessness. If there are any guitar solos here at all, they come toward the start and the finish of “How This Will End"", when a neon electric tone arches over a mounting cavalcade of drums and bass. Rather than serve as breaks in the momentum, though, both passages lead tremendous swells that rise to meet the troika of vocalists in another instance of triumph. Not one moment among these 11 minutes seems squandered or lost, as the quintet keeps rising and falling, churning and rebuilding.</p>
<p>Opener “Lullabye” establishes that principle from the jump, or as soon as traipsing acoustic guitar and twinkling piano concede to a heroic riff wrapped within three-part, gang-style harmonies. Mouth of the Architect move constantly between parts; at various points, they leap from near-silence to a quake viscous enough to make plenty of stoner metal sound thin, from guitar leads that suggest Chicago blues moan to math-rock redirection. Behind the kit, Mann serves as the expert rudder, keeping the songs steady even as he navigates the transfers. This constant swivel also depends upon the split vocal duties of Steve Brooks, Kevin Schindel, and Jason Watkins. They trade verses, flip-flopping between pristine radio rock leads and malevolent growls, sometimes only for a line at the time. They often share choruses, delivering them the sort of group-vocal abandon that hints at a darkened <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13755-danielson/"" target=""_blank"">Danielson Family</a>. Their singing-- here, more charged and urgent than it’s ever been-- gives all of the band’s moving pieces a through-line from one side to the other.</p>
<p>Talk of the tide of intelligent or somehow otherwise-elevated heavy music hasn’t faded during Mouth of the Architect’s temporary absence. Though both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a> and the late Isis have only released one album since MotA’s last one, the acceptance of and debate over nominally black metal acts such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"" target=""_blank"">Liturgy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4783-wolves-in-the-throne-room/"" target=""_blank"">Wolves in the Throne Room</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26785-kralice/"" target=""_blank"">Krallice</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"" target=""_blank"">Deafheaven</a> has kept that conversation current. Mouth of the Architect only nods to that <i>au courant</i> talking point during <i>Dawning</i>, most notably with the blizzard of tremolo guitars that open <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15354-it-swarms/"" target=""_blank"">“It Swarms”</a> and the clattering way the band emerges from an instrumental break during “Sharpen Your Axes”. But at the very least, <i>Dawning</i> deserves mention alongside Deafheaven’s <i>Sunbather</i>, a record that’s most notable for its holistic approach to drama and romance and the complete cinema of itself. Mouth of the Architect has long written from a vantage of imminent apocalypse, a perspective <i>Dawning </i>does not forego. There’s talk of collapsing systems and prevailing darkness, spent luck and idolized disrepair. But at record’s end, when Mouth of the Architect’s three singers trade and share lines about risking it all even if they come up short, it’s hard not to hear a core of redemption and potential hope within the music itself. And after returning from the brink to make one of the year’s most rapturous records, metal or post-metal or whatever, there had better be.   </p></div>"|18068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18068-mouth-of-the-architect-dawning/|8.2|Grayson Currin

The band spent the first several years of its existence constructing an elaborate and involved monument of their metallic interests. Their debut, 2009’s <i>Untold Wait</i>, swiveled from lumbering stomp to swooping strings, all during a thesis-like 10-minute opener. Subsequent tracks raced through caustic punk sprints or lurched through swampy mid-tempo charges; they crawled along an elegant doom arc, only to emerge into recalcitrant, noisy rumbles gilded by strings and electronics.</p>
<p>If the first four years in the Morne workshop were about building something ornate, however, the last four years have been about not deconstruction so much as simply removing stylistic excess. Morne have attempted to refine the foundation beneath the indulgence. Their debut for Profound Lore, 2011’s <i>Asylum</i>, trimmed much of the up-tempo aggression, ensconcing even their outbursts in sounds that were slower, steadier and heavier. During closer “Volition”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2168-jarboe/"" target=""_blank"">Jarboe</a> added her ghastly coo above weepy piano and strings. In the song’s final third, the delicacy yielded to an incandescent, electric smolder that was at once grim and meticulous. After six years and two albums, Morne had finally arrived at their essence-- a refined and molten sort of doom, capable of sudden and surprising detours.   </p>
<p>As the dimly lit name and colony-of-cobwebs cover suggests, <i>Shadows</i>, Morne’s third album, slinks deeper into doom. They trim the track list to five songs and stretch three of the numbers beyond the 10-minute mark; for comparison’s sake, <i>Asylum </i>and <i>Untold Wait</i> included seven tracks each and a collective total of only three quadruple-digit running times. Opener “Coming of Winter” begins with a roar of monolithic amplifier consonance, a flood of sound emptying into a void. The motion eventually rises into a half-time charge of seesaw melodies and sandpaper screams, a black mass of stepwise accretion. Indeed, most every piece of <i>Shadows</i> follows this generalized stratagem of starting slow and low but steadily escalating into organized upheaval. “A Distance” first wafts through a web of alien electronics and desolate riffs, anchored by a militaristic drum tromp. But the song’s midsection browbeats with sluggish thrash, a heavyweight attempting to summon a featherweight’s agility. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15542-new-dawn/"" target=""_blank"">“New Dawn”</a> first feels like an attempt to crush with sheer sonics, with surges of distorted bass collapsing atop circular guitar and a simple drum kit plod; as the track accelerates, however, Morne suggests a refined <i>Dopesmoker</i>, the band orbiting a memorable theme like it’s a mantra. Despite these consistent shifts from near-silence to sizable roar, <i>Shadows</i>’ dynamic range seems nonexistent by album’s end, largely because Morne is incapable of pushing past the mold it has set for itself.  In their quest to define their sound, Morne forgot to allow room for deviation. To wit, the instrumental closer mostly functions as a standard album track only without words. Morne gets trapped by how they <i>hope</i> to sound.</p>
<p>Given the minimizing trend of their three-album output, Morne ostensibly wants to be a doom band and to elide the obvious intricacies and complications of their earlier work for something more singular and settled. They’ve at least achieved that much on <i>Shadows</i>, a subgenre telegraph that genuflects to a form’s customs while simply nodding toward their own previous interests. As they’ve dove deeper into doom’s nearly still waters, they’ve lost some of their imagination and energy. Much of <i>Shadows</i> feels like it’s following pre-ordained charts and graphs, and it often seems like the band’s working too much here, trudging through what used to be enjoyable. It’s heavy but weightless, then, limping along on the surface but barely leaving a mark. “Pleasant” or “fine” aren’t words you’d generally associate with a band deliberately realigning itself with dirge sculptors such as Evoken or Thergothon, bands whose extreme subservience to an <i>idea </i>about how they should sound makes them polarizing nearly a quarter-century after they began. But with <i>Shadows</i>, Morne has become a perfectly pleasant doom band, turning the soundtrack of nightmares into little more than fine background music. Even on leaden wings, <i>Shadows</i> floats up and away as soon as its 50 minutes are done.</p></div>"|18189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18189-morne-shadows/|6.0|Grayson Currin

It feels strange in the London artist's case, however, because at the beginning of Benjamin Stefanski's career he was behind some of the zaniest dubstep of the genre's late-2000s boom. Tunes like ""7th Dimension"" made colourful pyrotechnics out of dubstep's skank, and even as he moved to house his penchant for larger-than-life sound design stuck around. But after founding his own Super label and then signing to Ninja Tune in 2011 (not to mention graduating from a conservatory), every new missive showed him gradually quieting his weirder impulses. And then, a few months ago, it peaked-- Raffertie dropped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15147-build-me-up/"" target=""_blank"">""Build Me Up""</a>, a quivering crooner, appearing on the single's sleeve all dolled up and proper. His long-awaited debut album, <i>Sleep of Reason</i>, strolls down the same path, an album of reflective songwriting and carefully contained outbursts.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Unlike so many other former dance artists, songcraft isn't a hurdle for Stefanski. He's always had an ear for melody; he discovered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30260-alunageorge/"" target=""_blank"">AlunaGeorge</a>, after all. His vocal tunes are blessed with simple, hooky phrases, lines that seem to curl around corners with a luxurious momentum. It's enough to save a track like ""Rain"", which comes close to suffocating under its own soporific weight thanks to some sonics lifted straight from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a>. That song succeeds because Stefanski's voice-- a workmanlike vehicle-- is up front and clear, emphasizing the smoothness of his songwriting.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Elsewhere on the album, Stefanski duels with his own atmosphere: the conflicting impulse at the heart of his musical development. ""Build Me Up"" competes with its instrumental, and elsewhere Raffertie's delicate melodies are trampled underfoot by the remnants of his over-the-top musical persona. It's when he aims for for something bolder than quiet storm R&amp;B that he most succeeds. On ""Principle Action"", his voice gets swallowed by a buzzing wall of sound, but it's <i>meant</i> to, and it's breathtaking. ""Gagging Order"", on the other hand, has a catchy theme buried somewhere beneath its array of fidgety sounds, but I'd be hard-pressed to recover it.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Carrying over some tracks from past Ninja Tune EPs, <i>Sleep of Reason</i> isn't a straight pop album; its best moments pulse with the nuclear energy of those early Planet Mu EPs. ""One Track Mind"" is the highlight, violently exploding arpeggios and all, and Raffertie's evolution into an expert arranger means he's always calm and in control. Skippy garage makes a welcome appearance propping up tender ballad ""Touching"", and quieter moments like ""Undertow"" are fascinating vignettes of intricate digital build-up and decay. But in his consummately cautious approach, he loses some of his personality; moments like ""Last Train Home"" and the maudlin duet ""Trust"" feel like they could have been made by anyone.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Sleep of Reason </i>ends in a flurry of emotion with the closing couplet ""Black Rainbow"" and ""Back of The Line"", where Raffertie controls waves of distortion and searing climax as if he were parting the sea. ""Back of The Line"" is especially affecting, where he warbles the choked voice of a man stuck behind his machines, constantly trying not to be dwarfed by their immensity. That's what most of <i>Sleep of Reason </i>sounds like-- it's an uneven but captivating album that sounds like an artist still looking for his stride and trying to balance between two extremes. He does it better than some of his peers, but he still has a while to go yet.</span></p></div>"|18349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18349-raffertie-sleep-of-reason/|6.2|Andrew Ryce

It's not larger-than-life, not a caricature, not a distillation of TV rap fantasies. His voice doesn't swell with braggadocio or bristle with rage. It's cool, but not cool in the way some people flaunt themselves and their own unflappable attitude, or callously disregard the lives of people they look down on. It's the cool of someone who, by necessity, has figured out how to detach himself from the emotional stress that would otherwise knock most people in the dirt. What's the point of embellishing something you already know is intense in itself? </p>
<p>The initial appeal of <i>The Night's Gambit </i>and Ka in particular is lyrics, and it'd be easy enough to just lay out a string of them to prove it. The Brooklyn rapper's thoughts scan well on paper, then unspool in a delivery that lets the internal rhyme structure provide the emotional emphasis. “You Know It's About” offers a scene of a street business days gone by with shifts of tense that make old memories fresh, emphasizing the cycle he can't believe he's not still stuck in: “With a toast to rap that roasts your fabric/ The friends, if conflict ever ends we're post-traumatic.” After that opener, the album is a litany of scenarios that play up guilt, betrayal, anxiety, resilience, and everything else that reduces interpersonal workings into a high-stakes chess match. Not for nothing that the three biggest thematic presences in intros and outros are games of strategy, martial arts philosophy, and the church-- tactical, adaptive maneuvering cut through with deep moral weight.</p>
<p>Maybe that seems a bit Recommended If You Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1812-gza/"" target=""_blank"">GZA</a>. But while the Wu MC has the bearings of someone doing scientific analysis, Ka's vibe is more like that of a true-crime reporter, trying to find a balance between laying out all the facts and trying not to let that excess of knowledge take a toll on his soul. Reformation narrative “Our Father” packs in enough observations, introspective and looking outwards, to drive this home clearly. But it also puts its point across by situating the rehabilitated perspective in the first verse and the vivid criminal revenge he's trying to atone for in the second. A mid-album stretch of cuts gets even more Scorsese with it, pervaded with criminal guilt on “Barring the Likeness”, restless brass ring-grabbing on “Nothing Is”, and calculating, whistling-through-a-graveyard iciness on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29234-roc-marciano/"" target=""_blank"">Roc Marciano</a> team-up “Soap Box”. And when he really does get double-meaning conceptual a'la “Labels” on “Off the Record”, it's a brilliant recursive trick: the rap he classics he references aren't evoked as mere namedropping, but reflections of how many different artists found indelible, unique ways to tell similar stories.</p>
<p>It's hard to separate the stark tone of Ka's voice and narrative from the equally stark mood music he embeds it in. As a rapper/producer, he has that finely-tuned awareness of how a track works from every angle. Some moments of upfront beauty shine through, as the soul-blues guitar licks and electric piano on “Jungle” cut through like a cold wind, and the aching, wordless hum that intermittently pierces the organ drone of “Knighthood” turns a meditative dirge into a hairs-on-end spiritual. But, like his voice, a lot of his production's pull lies in how its sparseness deeply sinks in just through exposure. The interpolation of that riff of doom from Black Sabbath's “Black Sabbath” on “You Know It's About” is a telling point of reference. Like the source material, he draws a lot of strength from the same insistent tritone, but turns its immediate menace into lurking dread by pushing it into the background and melting it down into bass frequencies. </p>
<p>Last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16447-ka-grief-pedigree/"" target=""_blank""><i>Grief Pedigree</i></a> showed a DIY auteur with one of the more unique and underreported stories in hip-hop. Despite the exposure that comes with his professional working partnership with Roc Marciano and a base in the ironclad diehard world of 1990s-steeped NYC hardcore hip-hop, the stakes of his come-up seem more personal than anything. His outlook on that recent groundswell of support has the levelheaded perspective of someone hitting his stride in his forties: “Of course this isn't over night sensation music...it's the music of the sensations you get over the course of the night”, he <a href=""https://twitter.com/BrownsvilleKa"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">quipped on Twitter</a>. And his work's total lack of compromise has the drive of someone who only got stronger when he stopped trying to do things on some other label's terms. If <i>The Night's Gambit </i>has that same imprint, the same ruminative, clinical yet human scale as its predecessor did, it also seems to have the renewed idea that this voice has something that really needs to be heard. Listen, then listen closer.</p></div>"|18341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18341-ka-the-nights-gambit/|8.0|Nate Patrin

With equal parts anxious anticipation and relief, Ian Draper barks “you’re not wasting time” to his companion, embodying the stomach-in-knots feeling that pervades the record: the two are going to sleep together that night or never see each other again, but nothing’s going to be left unsaid this time. It’s a confrontational song about a confrontation and it’s almost impossible for hear it and remain a disinterested bystander. My first listen, I wanted to tear a phonebook in half. A colleague said it made her want to cry, “in a good way.” But the heart’s a muscle too, right? Make no mistake, <i>Knots </i>is emo as hell and a reminder that the term evolved from “emotional hardcore.” It’s an album of real stakes and bone-deep commitment, where any honest interaction, of mind, body, or soul, is preferably full-contact.</p>
<p>The multifaceted construction of the band allows them to express themselves as both grounded and aspiring, a combination of Dischord’s stoic post-hardcore and the literate, heart-on-sleeve and girl crazy Midwestern emo of the mid-to-late 90s. Crash of Rhinos describe themselves as “five voices, two guitars, two basses, one drum kit,” adding, “we make a racket.” The roles are fluid, as drummer Oli Craven is just as likely to be foregrounded as any of the guitarists, while the overlap of steely, resonant lead vocals and unvarnished yelling result in both strident melodies and unorthodox harmonies. That’s a lot to keep track of and on their 2011 debut <i>Distal, </i>Crash of Rhinos occasionally lost the handle, a promising band a bit overwhelmed by their wealth of ideas.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Knots</i> unfold like brilliant football plays, utilizing synchronization, deception, quick cuts, speed and brawn, the individual players given omni-directional free reign for the larger purpose of forward momentum. “Opener” mirrors the dramatic conversation of its narrators where heavy emotions can no longer be expressed delicately and <i>everything </i>has to go right. All four guitars appear to strike out in different rhythms, yet churn forward by interlocking in their respective gaps and pauses. When “Opener” snaps into its pulverizing chorus, it puts the subtle restraint of <i>Knots </i>into sharp relief-- it’s the only time all five members appear to be acting in unison, and the force is devastating.  </p>
<p><i>Knots</i> is often every bit as hooky following “Opener”, though rarely as condensed into radio-readiness. More than half of the songs here extend past five minutes to accommodate every four-bar tangent or drum fill accenting the band’s burly barstool poetry and dashboard confessionals. I imagine Crash of Rhinos are partial to semicolons, as <i>Knots </i>abides by its instructions: pause. Collect yourself. <i>Go. </i></p>
<p><i></i>The album’s bookends “Luck Has a Name” and “Speeds of Ocean Greyhounds”, are reverse images of each other, the former sprinting out and cycling through quicksilver time changes before settling into a patient build, while the latter starts out as a ballad before closing out <i>Knots </i>with a percussive victory lap. “Sum of All Parts” feigns itself as a mid-album, waltz-timed cool-down before a chorus of doubled vocals and guitars that lunges out of the speakers. There are two short guitar instrumentals-- acoustic fingerpicking exercise “Everything Is” and the ruminative “The Reason I Took So Long”-- and while beautiful in their own right, they’re the only points on <i>Knots </i>where Crash of Rhinos limit themselves to <i>one </i>thing.</p>
<p>They both prove necessary in establishing continuity throughout <i>Knots, </i>as Crash of Rhinos get increasingly ambitious throughout. The first half acknowledges its debt to the bands that will draw in new listeners and nostalgists-- think a softer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a>, a musclebound version of tourmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29315-braids/"" target=""_blank"">Braid</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/91-and-you-will-know-us-by-the-trail-of-dead"">…And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead</a>,  anything J. Robbins has been involved with-- while Side B goes out into more audacious, free-form compositions. On “Mannheim”, they tease out the dissonant chords and oblong time signatures of their earlier work. “Standards &amp; Practice” weaves two gracefully looping guitars for a melody too distinct to allow counterpoint-- instead, the band’s vocals clash in brassy, atonal harmonies like free jazz horns. You get the sense that <i>Knots </i>could be a standard in its current genre, but the exploratory second half suggests Crash of Rhinos are working towards transcending it.</p>
<p>It’s that combination of potential and realization that gives <i>Knots </i>a spiritual connection to its lineage in addition to a sonic one. A UK band whose influences are entirely American, you can picture Crash of Rhinos watching YouTubes of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyqaEKzt8M4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">old Fugazi</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07VHWzx_EPc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Braid shows</a> and wishing they had something similar, where the communal expression was as meaningful for the crowd as the artist. The best of this stuff felt like it was perpetually on the verge, that something was at stake, and that’s where <i>Knots </i>finds the energy to answer its main philosophical challenge: Is fear stronger than your desire for emotional freedom?<i> </i>This is played out on centerpiece “Impasses”, where guitarist Richard Birkin screams “it could’ve been a waste of your time!” before the band spasms and double clutches, working up the courage to admit “it wasn’t a waste of mine!” It’s a raw moment, expressing the kind of sentiment that leaves one vulnerable and prone to embarrassment if it’s not reciprocated. There’s an undeniable catharsis in crossing that line as well and after that point, “Impasses” can never go back to being the tense and composed post-punk it presented itself as in the beginning. Instances like these make <i>Knots </i>feel vital. While indie rock still primarily traffics in timid sounds and mannered emotions, Crash of Rhinos dare to care too much on <i>Knots </i>and their risk is our reward<i>.</i></p></div>"|18357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18357-crash-of-rhinos-knots/|8.1|Ian Cohen

It took Kelly's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4819-the-cairo-gang/"" target=""_blank"">Cairo Gang</a> some seven years to follow their fine 2006 debut with a proper full-length, last year's spare, solemn <i>The </i><i>Corner Man</i>. In the meantime, Kelly's kept Cairo fans in one-offs and curios, but he's mostly been busy carving out the space around <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"" target=""_blank"">Will Oldham</a>'s immortal voice on a pair of stellar, characteristically stark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/"" target=""_blank"">Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy</a> records. Kelly's exacting nature comes through in much of his recent work: he rarely uses two notes when one will do.</p>
<p><i>Tiny Rebels</i>, the Cairo Gang's new six-song mini-LP, finds Kelly throwing much of that caution to the wind. Rebels came together in a fit of inspiration: recorded in a week, with both the same musicians and the same instruments on every track, the reverb-thick, unabashedly Byrdsy <i>Rebels</i> is driven by a spontaneous streak even Kelly seems a little surprised he had in him. Not that <i>Rebels</i> is some slapdash affair; Kelly and company committed every sound on <i>Rebels</i> to quarter-inch tape, and the placement of each chiming guitar and analog crackle feels purposeful. Vocals come in twos and threes, a mist of echo hangs over just about everything; parts of <i>Rebels</i> sound beamed in directly from 1966, just as psychedelia started creeping its way toward folk-rock. But, amidst <i>Rebels</i>' taut harmonies and stately chord shuffles-- and despite the backward glance of its sonics-- there's an undeniable urgency at work here, a sense that this stuff all but burst forth from Kelly, fully-formed.<br/><br/>Still, whenever you work this fast, you're always running the risk of letting something slip. <i>Tiny Rebels</i> seems to know exactly how it wants to sound; it's what to say-- and how to say it-- that seems a little less clear. Last year's <i>The </i><i>Corner Man</i> threw Kelly's voice way out front, offering it nowhere to hide among the barren accompaniment. Kelly sang the words with grave austerity but their plainspoken nature left little question as to what Kelly hoped to get across. On <i>Tiny Rebels</i>, Kelly coats his voice-- and virtually every other surface-- in enough reverb that meaning is often left obscured in a haze of ringing chords and tandem vocals. </p>
<p>And the lyrics peeking through the clouds just feel a bit imprecise, particularly up against the front-and-center Kelly of <i>The </i><i>Corner Man</i>; it's as though, after putting it all out there not so many months ago, Kelly's a bit reticent to share that much again. Halfway through ""Shake Off,"" when Kelly confesses ""I don't fucking feel much"" and quickly starts to rail against ""all the retarded bullshit I must be able to shake off,"" it's a shock: for just a fleeting second or two, you can actually make out a real person-- and not just a slice of received wisdom or a paisley-tinted caricature-- in Kelly's vaseline-spackled lens. <i>Tiny Rebels</i> certainly proves the slow-going Kelly and company can make a great-sounding little record in seven days' time. But, with that frustrating distance between <i>Tiny Rebels</i>' finely tuned sonics and Kelly's uncharacteristically indistinct lyrics, it's hard not to wonder what another week might've done.</p></div>"|18332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18332-the-cairo-gang-tiny-rebels/|5.6|Paul Thompson

Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">The Weeknd</a>, who produced sporadic sessions as the Noise before a name change and a dollop of mystery sent his career into the stratosphere, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a>, who toiled in obscurity as Def Jam songwriter Lonny Breaux prior to 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15172-nostalgia-ultra/"" target=""_blank""><i>Nostalgia, Ultra</i></a>, PARTYNEXTDOOR had been making cheery EDM-infused R&amp;B under his real name Jahron Brathwaite before starting with a clean slate. Brathwaite’s OVO acquisition was announced with an <a href=""http://octobersveryown.blogspot.com/2013/04/partynextdoor-make-mil.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unassuming track drop</a> on Drake’s October’s Very Own blog. The song, “Make a Mil”, found PARTYNEXTDOOR running through fleet verses of self-assured melodic rap with greater ease and range as a singer than his benefactor. His eponymous self-titled mixtape trades the doe-eyed sensitivity of the Jahron B. material for something closer in spirit to the villainous player chronicles of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"" target=""_blank"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> and the Weeknd. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The album’s chock full of strippers and drugs, and our narrator navigates a succession of dimly lit clubs and private afterparties with devilish gusto, informing the exotic dancing love interest of “Relax with Me” that, “Girl yo ass is so instrumental” and noting elsewhere that “Shawty silhouette look like a dollar sign”. All of this is carried out in a vocal delivery that fuses an R&amp;B singer’s melodic finesse with the percussive wordplay of a rapper. In his lower register he’s a dead ringer for his boss; “Wus Good/Curious” invokes <i>So Far Gone</i> makeout cuts like “Houstatlantavegas”. When he draws his voice up into a high register word flurry on “Right Now” he essentially affects <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/"" target=""_blank"">Meek Mill</a>’s puppy dog yawp. If you close your eyes you might mistake “Tbh” and its oscillation between Brathwaite’s baritone and high tenor ranges for a lost Drake/Weeknd collaboration. Brathwaite’s a talented singer, but sometimes you get the impression he’s better at twisting and recapitulating sounds than inventing them. The inarguable triumph of PARTYNEXTDOOR is actually his production.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>PARTYNEXTDOOR</i> abounds with homespun beats that turn radio rap tropes inside out. “Make a Mil” and closer “Ballin’” both call in the foreboding 808s and the cricket chirp hi-hats of trap, but the former does it in service to a central melody played on what sounds like a Pan flute while the latter undercuts its cavernous low end with breathy flute notes that soak up all the menace. Mid-album highlight “Right Now” revolves around a breakneck synth figure, while “Break from Toronto” bastes otherwise unremarkable drum programming in a choice chop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"" target=""_blank"">Miguel</a>’s “Girl with the Tattoo”. Throughout the album PARTYNEXTDOOR’s flair for off-the-wall musical flourishes (the clinking glasses and noirish sax on “Wild Bitches”, the drillbit synth sound that piledrives the kick hits home on “Wus Good/Curious”, the brashly synthetic horn section on the chorus of “Make a Mil”) and propensity to stash melodic elements in unexpected corners (see: the marimba melody of “Over Here” and the album’s tendency to pair hollow kick thuds with deep bass hits to give the effect of trunk-rattling drums) collude to buoy these songs through fitful moments of mimicry. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Jahron Brathwaite’s decision to ditch the mealy mouthed, saccharine dance pop to transmogrify into PARTYNEXTDOOR has been a shot in the arm. He’s got the ear of Drake at a time when the Toronto MC’s presence has solidified into dominance, and his versatility as a producer and songwriter means he could be put to great use in the OVO pop machine. <i>PARTYNEXTDOOR</i> occasionally works better as an audition for future work with Drake than an expression of Brathwaite’s own aspirations as an artist. But it’s also clear from the bedroom intimacy of the production and the demo-like quality of some of the one- and two-minute sketches that pepper the album between the more fully realized songs that <i>PARTYNEXTDOOR</i> is maybe just a sampler. It spends much of its brief running time wandering around <i>Take Care</i>’s wheelhouse churning out deft approximations of Drake and Noah “40” Shebib’s pet sounds, but some of it is used to strip their signature brand of confessional hip-hop/R&amp;B fusion for parts to restructure it into something new.</p></div>"|18284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18284-partynextdoor-partynextdoor/|6.9|Craig Jenkins

Even the title of their second album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15202-as-high-as-the-highest-heavens-and-from-the-center-to-the-circumference-of-the-earth/""><i>As High as the Highest Heavens and From the Center to the Circumference of the Earth</i></a>, needs a careful and deliberate reading on first glance. The pace has quickened a little on <i>Circumambulation</i>, True Widow's debut for metal enclave <a href=""http://www.relapse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Relapse Records</a>, but it's so slight that it resembles a tortoise momentarily gaining a spring in its step. Otherwise, the formula is the same-- neolithic rock riffs, bone-tired vocals from Dan ""D.H."" Phillips, and brighter contributions from singer/bassist Nicole Estill. They still sound like a version of slowcore figureheads <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18712-codeine/"">Codeine</a> filtered through a lifetime of metal fandom, with both groups stubbornly sticking to a doleful tone that rarely lets up. It seems safe to say that Phillips has spent plenty of nights alone, staring ruminatively into last dregs of beer in the bottom of his glass.</p>
<p>Shoegaze is often mentioned in relation to True Widow, but its influence is rarely felt here outside of a few wistful vocal parts. There's a clarity to <i>Circumambulation</i> that doesn't fit the shoegaze tag very well, most of which is felt in the edge given to Phillips' emoting. This isn't a record that indulges escapist fantasies, it's one that brings the world into sharp focus. Drummer Timothy Starks plays with a simplicity that would make <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Rudd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Phil Rudd</a> proud, adding an extra layer of boneheadedness to tracks such as the leaden ""Numb Hand"". But this isn't an exercise in dumb rock in the way that AC/DC and some early Sub Pop bands practiced. Phillips is no <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7973-tad/"">Tad Doyle</a>, although he has a similar appreciation for meaty riffage. Mostly he's just sad, even when it's at odds with the music. There would be a far greater sense of menace if they removed Phillips' keening vocal from a track like the spidery ""Creeper"".</p>
<p>True Widow work by thoroughly exploring the core emotions in the rather coarse template they've etched out for themselves. There's a skill in doing that-- when rock acts go base, it's usually for a cheap thrill and churn, a chance to get their shit-eating grins on while spilling cheap beer all over the stage. <i>Circumambulation</i> is smarter than that, but there's also a sense that Phillips and his band are bleeding out crude rock moves (crunchy, simplistic riffs; meat-and-potatoes drumming) to see what degree of sentiment they can find down there. When it works on a track like ""S:H:S"" it's somewhat disarming, like finding a grizzled biker sobbing into his milk. Their greatest asset is Estill, who shows up in all the right places to lighten the mood, turning things skyward in ""Four Teeth"" just when staring at the floor with Phillips was beginning to feel unappealing.</p>
<p>This album should expand True Widow's audience, despite the barely perceptible advance over <i>Highest Heavens</i>. The climate feels right this time, especially with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a> picking up plaudits everywhere for mixing dreamy material with something harder. This doesn't go as high and wide as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18060-deafheaven-sunbather/""><i>Sunbather</i></a>, instead feeling more like its introverted half-sibling. But in a market seemingly still longing for 90s nostalgia of all stripes, there's certainly room for a band mining slowcore tropes to reach out and touch a bigger crowd. If something has changed since the last True Widow record it's in their ear for pacing, for knowing when to release the tension before it becomes an interminable trudge. It helps create something heavy yet tender, with Phillips sounding like he's stuck in a perpetual state of rubbing the world-weariness from his eyes. There's a weight here that could drag you down if you let it, but mostly this is a band searching for hope amid shattered dreams.</p></div>"|18287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18287-true-widow-circumambulation/|7.2|Nick Neyland

While on tour in Europe last August, just a month after issuing that ambitious record, the band’s tour bus <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-23257302"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">careened</a> through roadside barriers outside of Bath, England, and crashed violently into the woods beneath. The nine people in the bus suffered variable injuries, from cuts that got them out of the hospital quickly to, in the cases of drummer Allen Blickle and bassist Matt Maggioni, fractured vertebrae. Those injuries ultimately led Blickle and Maggioni to quit Baroness. Touring no longer seemed <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/two-baroness-members-leave-band-in-wake-of-bus-accident-20130326"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">feasible.</a></p>
<p>For that matter, no one in the band-- including frontman John Baizley-- knew when or if touring would even be possible again for Baroness. But seven months later, Baizley closed a letter to fans on the band’s website with the words “‘til the wheels fall off”; Baroness would return to the road with a different lineup, he vowed, “where we belong.” So during that afternoon set in Tennessee, Baizley turned his back to the crowd, <a href=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1017091_10151698780970056_1039617326_n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">looked at the camera</a>, bent backward, and threw up his arms with unabashed excitement-- <a href=""http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/john-baizley-talks-about-his-art-and-the-bus-accident-that-nearly-ended-baroness/Content?oid=4634469"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the same right arm</a> that had been burned in the crash, the left one that had been crushed in it. Behind him now, for as far as the lens could capture, a tent full of fans did the same thing, sharing in his stage-based homecoming. New scars, bad memories, replaced members and lingering pain be damned: Baroness was back.</p>
<p>A month before the accident in 2012, Baroness was two weeks into their two-month European tour when they stopped at the BBC’s studio at Maida Vale. They recorded an interview and four songs in Studio 4 with Dan Carter, host of Radio 1’s “Rock Show.” It seemed appropriate that Baroness would make their BBC debut in 2012 <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00wj5zh"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on a program named Rock Show</a>; <i>Yellow &amp; Green</i>, after all, shirked some of the more metallic, progressive, and punk qualities of the band’s earlier works, instead linking a string of would-be radio hits across a 75-minute set. <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-07-16/lifestyle/35487134_1_indie-rock-baroness-hard-rock"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Many critics suggested</a> that tunes like the drifting blues of “Foolsong”, the three-minute threat of “Sea Lungs” or the irrepressible hook of “Take My Bones Away” might serve as Baroness’ conduit to new audiences-- listeners who knew the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1534-foo-fighters/"" target=""_blank"">Foo Fighters</a> but not necessarily <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10043-kylesa/"" target=""_blank"">Kylesa</a>, Pink Floyd but not Eyehategod. <a href=""http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/160708-baroness-yellow-green/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PopMatters</a> even invoked the phrase “stadium-worthy rock.” Indeed, among the very real pain of Baroness’ bus crash remains an untested hypothetical, too: Had Baroness never wrecked but instead spent the last year touring and playing late-night television and generally sharing <i>Yellow &amp; Green</i> rather than recovering and restarting, could they now a <i>very big</i> rock band?</p>
<p>While <i>Yellow &amp; Green </i>found Baroness brandishing big hooks and sharp production, the versions of four of those songs that they performed at Maida Vale display the same grit and drive for which Baroness first garnered acclaim. Gathered on a limited-edition, one-sided LP, these renditions are rather faithful to their <i>Yellow &amp; Green </i>counterparts. Aside from “March to the Sea”, which accretes slowly through a wafting instrumental introduction, these takes reflect the lengths of their LP predecessors, with no extended twists or surprising turns. They do hit consistently harder than those on <i>Yellow &amp; Green</i>, an album that some longtime Baroness fans dismissed as too soft or perhaps too ready for the radio. Blickle and Maggioni browbeat their way through the verses of “March to the Sea”, the separation between bass and drums found on <i>Yellow &amp; Green</i> ceding to a more dense, bullying rendering. The crunch and churn of “Take My Bones Away” even threatens to swallow Baizley’s vocals whole, though they’re set so high and mighty above the band on the album. The rendition recalls the salad days of Baroness, when they roared through the Byzantine material from their first two EPs in punk houses and small clubs with tiny PAs, their extreme dynamic swings often burying Baizley in sound. Amid last year’s dual hubbubs about their newly sharpened rock songs and their subsequent crash, <i>Live at Maida Vale </i>preserves the memory of the pugnacious, strapping quartet at the center of it all.</p>
<p>Before their set at Bonnaroo, Baroness recorded <a href=""http://www.fuse.tv/videos/2013/06/bonnaroo-2013-baroness-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview with Fuse’s Liz Walaszczyk</a> backstage. After chatting about what they were excited to see at the festival, Walaszczyk idly asked Baizley and Adams how tour was going so far, at one point adding, “Isn’t touring exhausting?” But Adams talked with childlike enthusiasm about wanting to stay on the road with his friends indefinitely, about not wanting to go home for an upcoming two-week break. They were finally on the road in America, finally getting a chance to share what they’d done on <i>Yellow &amp; Green </i>from the stage. A year after that record’s release, <i>Live at Maida Vale </i>is a swift and unfaltering reminder<i> </i>that Baroness has ground to make up-- and the spirit and songs with which to do it.</p></div>"|18339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18339-baroness-live-at-maida-vale/|7.0|Grayson Currin

Throughout the St. Paul noise-pop pioneers’ 1980-87 tenure, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2842-bob-mould/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Mould</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1892-grant-hart/"" target=""_blank"">Grant Hart</a> exhibited a Lennon/McCartney-esque division of songwriting labor (and the festering internal tensions that inevitably result), but in terms of post-breakup public profile, Hart may as well be Pete Best. While Mould has remained in the spotlight through myriad ventures-- by selling hundreds of thousands of records with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8692-sugar/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Sugar</a>, becoming Jon Stewart’s jingle-writer, penning scripts for the WCW<b>,</b> and guesting on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1534-foo-fighters/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Foo Fighters</a> albums-- Hart has recorded only sporadically, taking several years and sometimes entire decades between releases. And whether he’s been serving up power-pop pleasures (1999’s <i>Good News for Modern Man</i>) or frazzled lo-fi psychedelia with the assistance of various <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"" target=""_blank"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> members (2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13586-hot-wax/"" target=""_parent""><i>Hot Wax</i></a>), his albums have suffered the same unceremonious fate, issued by obscure micro-indie labels and mostly ignored.</p>
<p>Recent times have been especially trying: Hart lost both his mother and father in the past two years (the latter’s death prompting an investigation into embezzlement by a nursing-home employee), while his long-time St. Paul house-- which had been in his family for nearly a hundred years-- was destroyed in a fire. Rubbing salt in the wounds was the fact that Hart’s greatest visibility in the past few years came via Mould’s tell-all autobiography, <i>See a Little Light</i>, which paints a damning portrait of his former foil. Hart, fortunately, has responded to this strife in true better-to-burn-out-than-fade-away fashion: by producing a 20-song, 74-minute concept album based one of the most totemic works of poetry of all time-- John Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i>-- as interpreted through an unfinished literary/stage adaptation by none other than William S. Burroughs.</p>
<p>This isn’t exactly uncharted territory for Hart: Hüsker Dü, of course, set <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Arcade"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the template for the punk rock song cycle</a>. Hart’s post-Hüsker Dü outfit Nova Mob explored overarching narrative frameworks on 1991’s <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i>, and his longtime friendship with Burroughs presents a direct personal connection to the endeavor. (The late author’s unpublished treatment of the Milton poem was bestowed to Hart by Burroughs’ long-time executor, James Grauerholz.) But the complexity of this mission pushes Hart well beyond his usual distorto-pop terrain: <i>The Argumen</i>t demands more theatrical, melodramatic performances than we’re used to hearing from Hart, and his musical palette here expands exponentially to include everything from operatic glam-rock (“Awake, Arise!”) and militaristic marches (“If We Have the Will”) to stormy psychedelic soundscapes (“War in Heaven”) and old-timey mandolin-plucked folk (“Underneath the Apple Tree”). But the real triumph of <i>The Argument</i> isn’t its ambitious scope or narrative heft, but the fact that you don’t need a degree in English Lit to enjoy it. And for all its stylistic variance and densely packed lyricism, Hart’s melodic gifts are unmistakable throughout.</p>
<p>It helps that <i>Paradise Lost</i> is rooted in eternal themes-- good vs. evil, order vs. chaos, temptation vs. guilt-- that carry universal resonance, meaning most of these songs can stand alone independent of their conceptual context: the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"" target=""_blank"">Guided By Voices</a>-styled garage-pop shot “It Isn’t Love” works as both a warning of the devil’s manipulative ways, and a portrait of a womanizing lothario; “So Far From Heaven” is a paean to fallen angels condemned to hell, yet it boasts the same celestial language and congenial form as a classic 50s doo-wop song. But the songs take on added dimensions of poignancy when shot through the lens of Hart’s own hardscrabble life: If anyone’s earned the right to sing a wistful ballad about getting exiled from heaven called “I Will Never See My Home"", it’s a guy who recently watched his go up in flames, while the dazed-and-confused elegy “Is the Sky the Limit?” presents the sort of question asked only by those who’ve hit rock bottom and have nothing left to lose.</p>
<p>Inevitably with an album of this scale, there are moments where Hart’s attempts at role-play supersede the songcraft (like the one-note 60s-psych stomp of “I Am Death,” or the wind-chimed haze of the overlong title track). But for all its sprawl, <i>The Argument</i> maintains a brisk pace, with a <i>White Album</i>-inspired sense of irreverence that ensures Hart never gets stuck in place for long. No doubt, the album’s wandering spirit and baroque sensibility present a challenge to old-school fans who wish Hart and Mould would just bury the hatchet once and for all and unseat <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"" target=""_blank"">the Replacements</a> as this year’s unlikeliest Minnesotan indie-rock-vets reunion tour. But the great thing about <i>The Argument</i> is that, not only does it make a Hüsker Dü reformation seem like an evermore remote possibility, it makes the whole prospect that much more undesirable and unnecessary. </p></div>"|18312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18312-grant-hart-the-argument/|8.0|Stuart Berman

McLamb scrounged together seven-piece band to tour the record, and the adaptation of the rough-hewn debut album to a live setting was a revelation, as the motley lineup made each of McLamb’s songs pop in high-contrast technicolor. But McLamb's 2010 Merge debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14464-libraries/"" target=""_blank"">Libraries</a>, </i>found him continuing to record solo, crafting nuggets of Burt Bacharach inspired baroque pop if never quite moving beyond mid-tempo indie rock competency. McLamb’ took two years to record his third LP as the Love Language, <i>Ruby Red,</i> this time with the help over over 20 musicians across a handful of timezones. This album’s recording process was the complete antithesis of McLamb’s previous efforts, and the collaborative spirit has led to a record of relaxed confidence.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The production details and influences that produced the most interesting moments from the previous albums-- Spector’s orchestral swathes, Bacharach’s deceptively simple pop compositions, a steely garage rock nerve, the twangy alt-country stomp-- have coalesced and hardened into a full-bodied dynamic sound that bristles with excitement and pleasure. <i>Ruby Red</i> is a willfully effervescent record that wears its pop music heart on its sleeve; string and horn sections are used liberally to crest and smash with the motion of McLamb’s melodies, while anthemic guitar figures and radio-ready hooks whistle through each song like they were designed to pour out of a set of car speakers.</p>
<p>The lingering mopiness that permeated <i>Libraries</i>’ is swapped for the unabashed enthusiasm in songs like track one <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15426-calm-down/"" target=""_blank"">“Calm Down”</a>, a bass-chugging thrasher that erupts into a piano/tambourine driven chorus. ""Calm Down"", along with the family-friendly garage rock of “Kids”, along with the loungey, sunkissed harmonies of “Hi Life” and the classical crooning vibe of “Golden Age”, make for a solid tour through McLamb’s M.O. on <i>Ruby Red</i>, as he filters a handful of faithfully rendered canonical styles from pop music’s history through his indie rock sensibilities. Even the weaker ballad “Knots”--which is marred by a shaky vocal performance early on-- slowly transforms into a heart-melting, jaunty, string-laden sing-along. This is the album that should have followed McLamb’s quaintly lo-fi debut and ensuing tours, as the small army of collaborators brings his pop music vision to life. McLamb seems to be relishing the chance to get outside of his head, making music that is gorgeous and unashamedly fun. </p></div>"|18294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18294-the-love-language-ruby-red/|7.5|Patrick Bowman

Monikers like Palace of Worms and Lake of Blood capture the mind’s eye, while Ride for Revenge, Pig Destroyer, and diSEMBOWLMENT send chills down the spine. While a Skeletal Spectre haunts your dreams and a Front Beast with One Tail, One Head lurks in the shadows behind your bedroom door, a <a href=""http://www.mammothgrinder.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mammoth Grinder</a> sounds like a fearsome contraption in a scene from some wintry Neolithic <i>Fargo</i>, a sputtering metallic beast cranking out ropes of dark, bloody flesh and orchestrating a chorus of deafening clangs, frenzied roars, and whirring blades as the show turns crimson beneath it.</p>
<p>You could describe the Austin band Mammoth Grinder's latest album in much the same way. It's been four years since the release of <i>Extinction of Humanity</i>, but Mammoth Grinder’s third full-length <i>Underworlds</i> maintains that forward momentum-- it's a savage collection that sees the four-piece (who were a trio the last time we heard from them) heading straight for the jugular from the first note and tearing through the title track in under two minutes. It’s the kind of entrance that catches you off guard, and the intensity doesn’t let up. When they go slow, it’s all sludgy, bludgeoning breakdowns and Stockholm grooves; when they speed up, it’s a torrential storm of gutter thrash and hardcore punk that aims to fuck things up faster than a Sharknado. The band have long incorporated death metal elements into their songwriting, and the 2011 split with a grind-heavy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31496-hatred-surge/"" target=""_blank"">Hatred Surge</a> (with whom they share key members) may have dropped some major hints, but on <i>Underworlds</i>, Mammoth Grinder have fully come into their own as genre-bashing geniuses.</p>
<p>“Wraparound Eyes” stomps in with a big fat groove and dips in and out of the same, padding out the rest with Disfear-driven d-beats and Entombed riffs, while “Revenge” sounds like Bolt Thrower’s “... For Victory” sped up to 45 RPM with a few lines of yayo laid out on top. “Roperide” has the album’s best moshpit anthem-- you can almost see the bodies fly. Three-minute burner “Cog in the Machine” is an epic by Mammoth Grinder’s standards, and they use those extra thirty seconds to hammer their message home (hint: it’s not a very nice one). “Born in a Bag” is pure Swedish death down to the guitar tone and whiplash guitar solo, and album closer “Moral Crux” drags it all back down, a stoned stomp towards oblivion. (You can’t go wrong with a good “bleah!” grunt.) When not indulging his inner Matt Harvey, vocalist Chris Ulsh’s hoarse throat erupts again and again as a gravelly warning or enraged bellow; you can hear the spittle flying out and feel his white knuckle deathgrip on the mic.</p>
<p>The album is peppered with the kind of wild-eyed, squealing guitar licks that’d make Jeff Hanneman proud, and a big, hollow drum sound acts as a powerful backup generator for when the guitar and basslines need a bar or two to breathe. Brevity is the soul of wit, after all, and much like a particularly cutting Oscar Wilde diss, the short lengths of the songs come off as calculated and clever. Nothing feels hasty or rushed. Mammoth Grinder know exactly how to get in, cause a ruckus, and get out in three minutes or less, and aren’t interested in belaboring their point. They've earned the right to keep it tight.</p></div>"|18262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18262-mammoth-grinder-underworlds/|7.3|Kim Kelly

Nonetheless, the Bay Area sextet engages the listener with classic, deal-closing salesmanship in the process: they tell you what they’re gonna say, they say it, and then they tell you what they just said. Start with their name, which was changed from the original “Whirl.” Recall their 2011 EP <i>Distressor </i>and 2012 debut LP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16387-pipe-dreams/"">Pipe Dreams</a>, </i>which were compared to basically every 90s shoegaze band you still listen to. And consider song titles like “Swoon"", “Drain” and “Keep”, all one-syllable verbs that evoke the slowest movements or a complete standstill. It’s clear they favor the swirling, deliberate iterations of their chosen genre and on <i>Around’s </i>four sweeping tracks, Whirr deliver on their sales pitch. The problem is that they fulfill a need for a certain audience, but they don't create demand amongst those outside of it. </p>
<p>Forgoing the relatively tight strictures of<i> Pipe Dreams</i>, Whirr position themselves within the realm of NorCal bands that have been using intimidation tactics to coax beauty out of their guitars. As with the Deftones/ISIS collaborative <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18260-palms-palms/"">Palms</a>, Whirr’s song lengths are in place seemingly as self-fulfilling prophecy-- played at twice the speed, you might be able to hear nine-minute opener “Drain” as a pop song with elegant melodic motion and a fairly standard structure, but that’s not the point of <i>Around. </i>The point is to push “Drain” to an extreme of tempo and volume, to see how loud and slow it can get while still maintaining its figure.<i> </i>Though they lack the Brooklyn transplanted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29185-weekend"">Weekend</a>’s propulsion (or at least have no interest in it), Whirr similarly layer shrieking fuzz guitars to the point where they become meditative and mesmeric. Guitarist Nick Bassett used to play in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a>, and at its best, <i>Around </i>momentarily touches <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18060-deafheaven-sunbather/""><i>Sunbather</i></a>’s all-encompassing fire/water, agony/ecstasy rapture<i>.</i></p>
<p>Whirr just happens to go about it the same way over <i>Around’s </i>half hour and, as a result, the record<i> </i>focuses more on juxtaposition and texture than impression. They work with fairly commonplace dualities: babymaking music under the threat of apocalypse, fluttering vocals against flagrant guitars. Most of all, Whirr use brittle material to create an impenetrable, impervious wall of sound. All of this stuff inevitably traces back to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine"">My Bloody Valentine</a> and with the distorted guitars and cooing vocals so distended they sound a bit modal, you can imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17726-mbv/""><i>m b v </i></a>in a metal mood<i>.</i> With enough scrutiny, the four tracks here distinguish themselves: “Keep” stands out on account of moving with a swinging gait rather than a plod, evoking a monstrous cover of Cocteau Twins ca. <i>Treasure. </i>It also contains the clearest and most idiosyncratic lyric-- Esfandiari breathes “insecurities make me shy,” punctuated by a startling thrust of pulverized guitar. That’s how all the immediately striking moments occur here-- there’s a small break before the low end hits and the distortion surges even further into the red, the loud/soft dynamics of grunge given shoegaze exaggeration in terms of both volume and tempo.</p>
<p>The tidal pull and deep blue-black disposition of <i>Around </i>creates an ambience that makes for an easy selling point-- Pure Moods music for people who dream about the kind of vacations where they sit alone on a freezing beach at night. Is it pretty? Of course it is. But how much of <i>Around’</i>s beauty is attributable to Whirr and how much of it's predetermined due to natural forces? Without an insatiable need for shoegaze that can get doomy without edging into metal, it’s tough for the listener to ascertain what exactly is at stake on <i>Around. </i>You’re not here for the lyrics, though it is worth noting that while the central refrain of “Drain” (“drain me”) may not have been used verbatim in any My Bloody Valentine or Slowdive song, it’s the basic sentiment that’s driven the genre since the beginning-- the listener submits to the artist’s pummeling sound in exchange for cleansing and catharsis. But, on <i>Around</i>, Whirr don’t elevate themselves beyond the level of a listener; instead, they remain supplicant to their influences.</p></div>"|18335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18335-whirr-around/|6.2|Ian Cohen

The last couple of years have found a crop of young independent artists boldly attempting to reconcile those stages of their own listening life cycles, walking a tightrope of poptimism and experimentalism to create confectionary, homespun electronic music that’s sometimes described as <i>future-pop</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a> gushes about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10697-mariah-carey/"" target=""_blank"">Mariah Carey</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a> in the same breath; Canadian duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Purity Ring</a> have listed “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/"" target=""_blank"">Justin Timberlake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28780-holy-other/"" target=""_blank"">Holy Other</a>” as inspirational forces behind their prismatic fairy tales; Glaswegian electro trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches/"" target=""_blank"">Chvrches</a> have spoken about loving <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">the Cure</a> in interviews before divulging plans to cover Whitney Houston’s “It’s Not Right, But It’s Okay” in live shows. These omnivorous tendencies-- along with the breakdown of genre boundaries and advancement of affordable home recording technology-- have created inviting territory for the cleverest and most enterprising young musicians to explore.</p>
<p>Another intriguing act within the growing corral of future-pop artists is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30260-alunageorge/"" target=""_blank"">AlunaGeorge</a>, a UK duo comprised of vocalist Aluna Francis and producer George Reid. When the two began giving interviews last year, they mentioned their love of old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"" target=""_blank"">Neptunes</a>-produced hits along with affinities for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Newsom</a>. Together the pair have adeptly synthesized those tastes and perfected a futuristic sound that blends wonky, wobbly beats drawn from 2-step and glitch with the irresistible hooks of “TRL”-era pop and the 90s R&amp;B it was heavily indebted to. A decade ago, Aluna Francis might have been a long-lost member of Dream, the all-girl group behind the sleeper hit “He Loves U Not”, or a contestant on Diddy’s ill-fated “Making the Band”. The pair’s lyrics can even feel as though they were written for young teens of an era before smartphones and social media platforms mediated pubescent growing pains. “I usually wait for you to call/ But it’s getting closer between me and you,” Francis laments on the balladesque new song “Friends to Lovers”. “How do you make the change from friends to lovers/ When you risk looking like a fool?”</p>
<p>Following <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16540-you-know-you-like-it-ep/"" target=""_blank"">last year’s EP</a> on Brooklyn label Tri Angle, their debut album <i>Body Music</i> arrives on a major (Island in the UK, the indie Vagrant in the U.S.); about half of its songs are new. The collection is a remarkably seamless extension of their early songs, an expert execution of a concept and aesthetic that felt perfectly crystallized even before anyone knew who the duo were. While there’s nothing on <i>Body Music</i> that hits quite as hard as their breakout hit, the crystalline R&amp;B song “You Know You Like It”, there’s hardly a weak track to be found (save a misguided bonus cover of Montell Jordan’s “This Is How We Do It”). They tinker with a bit of balladry (“Friends to Lovers”), niche dance genres (“Lost &amp; Found”), and lite disco-funk (“Kaleidescope Love”), but everything retains a uniformly slick veneer, propelled by Francis’ slightly warped, nasal vocals and ice-princess posture. There’s an enticing liquidity that carries over from the earlier material-- beyond lyrics like “I want to be a diver into the sea” and “I've been treading water for your love”, the songs can sound like water hitting hard, shiny surfaces, or like ice chips being shot though narrow chrome tubes. The entire album is sexy and strange and sugary all at once. That these songs were recorded over the course of a couple years (straddling a major-label deal) and still maintain total fluidity throughout speaks to the strength and maturity of the duo’s initial formula.</p>
<p>But there, in the word formula, lies the catch. There's not much <i>wrong</i> with <i>Body Music</i>, but its constellation of contemporary electro-pop elements can sometimes feel too slick for its own good. Francis and Reid almost do themselves a disservice by being so competent, by executing a single, well-defined sound so consistently and so tidily that the record can begin to create a lull. That’s been the fate of some of AlunaGeorge’s peers as well: Purity Ring’s 2012 debut possessed the same paradoxically frustrating one-note perfection; Chvrches’ sound is crisp and singular enough that they could face a similar challenge. It’s also possible that the sheer number of artists springing up and inhabiting this sphere slackens the <i>future</i> angle in all this future-pop. For Francis and Reid, one possible escape from their shiny little box might be to further experiment with blossoming dance music trends-- something they successfully tried their hand at on a recent collaboration with Disclosure, another UK duo doing exciting, retro-futuristic things with newly malleable genre boundaries. But for now, it's hard to complain about AlunaGeorge being a little bit too focused. </p></div>"|18298.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18298-alunageorge-body-music/|7.6|Carrie Battan

Their underrated sophomore LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9820-some-loud-thunder/""><i>Some Loud Thunder </i></a>absorbed the inevitable backlash, but whatever momentum CYHSY could generate from critical reappraisal was squandered by a four-year hiatus, 2011’s tepid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15805-hysterical/""><i>Hysterical</i></a>, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47083-clap-your-hands-say-yeah-members-leave-band/"">subsequent departure of two band members</a>. As a result, though <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1811-clap-your-hands-say-yeah/"">their debut’s</a> origin story would be commonplace in 2013, to even say the name “Clap Your Hands Say Yeah” suggests an intent to evoke “man, <i>2005</i>” anachronism. But you can also see how an artist as publicity-averse and creatively fitful as Alec Ounsworth could use this situation to his advantage-- he always came off like a sincere guy who just wanted to release music without all the attendant bullshit and <i>Little Moments </i>is a quickie EP that lowers the stakes and allows his band to follow a whim. Unfortunately, it’s a more confused work than a confident reinvention, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah making a complete left turn just to half step.</p>
<p>You can say this much-- at least superficially, it doesn’t recall anything CYHSY has done in the past, with the possible exception of their debut’s infamous opener “Clap Your Hands!” <i>Little Moments </i>likewise features no guitars and Ounsworth’s vocals are most often mixed in a way that’s seemingly meant to drive out all but the most forgiving listeners. In short, CYHSY have gone full-on electro-pop for about 20 minutes. But even in this guise, it’s hard to mistake this for the work of anyone else especially since “Once” could pass for “The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth” done up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29077-the-electronic-anthology-project"">Electronic Anthology Project</a>-style. Even <i>Hysterical </i>had a few keepers and Ounsworth hasn’t lost his knack for writing sticky melodies expressed in long strides, staggered sibilating, or outright ululation; his voice impresses upon you whether you like it or not. More crucially, these are pop songs, not <i>electronic </i>songs-- they still rely on verse-chorus structure rather than groove. After all, this is the guy who equated dancing with damnation on <i>Some Loud Thunder</i>’s “Satan Said Dance”.</p>
<p>The problem is that the sound of <i>Little Moments </i>is inexcusably amateur or that of<i> </i>a guitar band learning how to write electronic music on the fly. Combined with the slapdash “Photoshop font + .jpg” cover art, if there wasn’t a price tag attached to these songs, I’d just as quickly assume they were Ounsworth’s home demos. Though it bears no resemblance to the overly mannered indie rock of <i>Hysterical, Little Moments </i>similarly gives you little reason to continue calling CYHSY ""quirky."" The four songs here are composed of the most basic synth-pop presets-- octave-jumping riffs, basslines that pulse on every upbeat, sickly synthesized strings, an occasional non sequitur of a sample. None of it retains the pleasing precision and concision of the best stuff. The mix is thin and unbalanced, putting too much emphasis on Ounsworth’s most grating affectations even when he's obscured by aluminum filters. The addition of live percussion at least indicates that it isn’t Ounsworth fucking around on Fruity Loops, but it’s also a reminder of how a voice with that many sharp edges is best situated within equally prickly indie rock and jittery disco beats. Over the slicked-up textures of “Heaven”, Ounsworth never finds steady footing, his enunciation is so unctuous, he may as well be ad-libbing. </p>
<p>Still, it’s somewhat encouraging that CYHSY can put out something in 2013 capable of triggering stronger reactions than the soft disappointment inspired by <i>Hysterical. </i>According to their Bandcamp, <a href=""http://clapyourhandssayyeah.bandcamp.com/album/unreleased-cyhsy-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an untitled fourth album</a> is already in the works at the turn of the calendar year and it’s hard not to root for them at this point; there were a number of things embarrassing about Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and the vague construct of “blog-rock” from 2005-2007-- the name, the earliest live shows, the idea that it could somehow completely alter the music industry-- but <i>Clap Your Hands Say Yeah </i>and <i>Some Loud Thunder </i>were definitely not among them. There’s no conceivable rebranding that will make Clap Your Hands Say Yeah overhyped rather than underdogs again and if they’re going to move forward as simply a good band, <i>Little Moments </i>is hopefully a purge of misguided ideas or a transition into something more committal.</p></div>"|18343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18343-clap-your-hands-say-yeah-little-moments-ep/|4.0|Ian Cohen

But if their early work was driven by a distinct disinterest in rules and predictability, especially in the middle of a wider movement's healthy bouts of iconoclasm, is it worth getting disappointed when that classic-homage sound rises up to take its place-- especially when the end result is fairly enjoyable on the surface?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That's a paradox that pops up in frustrating ways on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22487-ikonika/"" target=""_blank"">Ikonika</a>'s new album <i>Aerotropolis</i>, a stated tribute to the old-school freestyle house and synthpop jams that soundtracked Sara Abdel-Hamid's 80s youth. And while the short answer to what would happen if Ikonika was old enough to make music at the time is ""a pretty good record,"" that puzzling Mobius strip of inspiration and expression leans so heavily on the idea of pop as a historical waypoint that something feels a bit detached. Not on its own context-free musical level, granted, but in the larger scope of the reputation Ikonika's made for herself as one of late-period dubstep's more melodically subversive and off-kilter composers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If that means the album's biggest flaw is that it nails a certain aesthetic too faithfully, that's not a very harmful problem to have. Early album cut ""Beach Mode (Keep It Simple)"", which recruits up-and-coming singer Jessy Lanza, is Ikonika's first-ever vocal track, and the coolly haunted tone it sets is immediately resonant as something deeply affectionate for a clearly remembered (and reassembled) past. It's a feel that runs a line through the whole album-- the burbling fusion of synthpop and boogie funk ""Mr Cake"", the Madchester throb of ""Eternal Mode"" and ""Lights Are Forever"", Class of 1987 house tribute ""Manchego"", and the upended cathedral chords of Optimum teamup ""Mega Church"". It's far from a cold and emotionless recitation of last generation's digital pop heritage; if those aforementioned tracks don't race pulses, ""Cryo"" and its foreboding minor-key stormcloud formations should call up shivers. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So why is there this nagging feeling that something's missing? Ikonika's transition to vintage sounds and signifiers, whether through old-school synths or uncluttered 4/4 patterns, is reverent enough to parallel their sources instead of update or subvert them. And even when she pulls back the curtain to nudge the listener over how much of a stylistic transition this album might be-- one of the shorter, more skeletal exercises in gaining her throwback footing with Hacienda-ready 808s and keyboards is called ""Practice Beats""-- it sounds more like a history lesson than history in the making. Her 2010 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14131-contact-love-want-have/"" target=""_blank""><i>Contact, Love, Want, Have</i></a> was a thrill because it had the self-admitted playfulness of an artist learning as she went, leaving a trail of brightly smart-assed tweaks to formula-- she fit right in with that year's trailblazing class of gloom-defying bass artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22494-joker/"" target=""_blank"">Joker</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even as last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16867-i-make-lists-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>I Make Lists</i></a> EP darkened her style a bit, it still had a similar unpredictable intrigue and sense of left-field jitteriness that was too lighthearted to be alienating. <i>Aerotropolis</i>' 180 pop move-- as comfortable and assured in its own niche as it is-- is so abrupt that it almost feels like an innovative rulebreaker hitting the reset button and starting a completely new, much more familiar persona from scratch. Where things go from here hinges on what happens if or when she finds a way to upend that end result in the same way she crashed the scene to start. No doubt it'll sound good-- but fingers crossed it'll also sound strange.</p></div>"|18304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18304-ikonika-aerotropolis/|6.5|Nate Patrin

Washed out colors and stripped-down fonts (or, in music, lightly distorted guitars and reverb-tinged vocals) offer a sort of distressed beauty that suggests depth and implies seriousness. Art, these images and sounds suggest, may be hard to define, but you know it when you reblog it. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">LA.-based singer <a href=""http://hatenylo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nylo</a> supported herself for a while as a graphic designer and session musician, so she has a feel for cool, crafted product. She released a debut EP last year in what has become an archetypal model for hip R&amp;B acts, dropping a fully-formed project with almost no supporting information other than a monochromatic cover. That collection, <i>Memories Speak</i>, landed perfectly on trend, mimicking the careening production and lacerating self-doubt of the Weeknd and echoing the smooth pop vocal confidence of Keri Hilson or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5068-ciara/"" target=""_blank"">Ciara</a>. Nylo was doing the right things to suggest she had a vision worth paying attention to, and attention quickly followed. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30111-mac-miller/"" target=""_blank"">Mac Miller</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"" target=""_blank"">Nas</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/MacMiller/status/242662850424877057"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/Nas/status/341633411057844225"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">excited endorsements</a>, and Nylo landed a major label deal with Epic.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The follow-up mixtape, <i>Indigo Summer</i>, continues in the same vein, hinting at meaning through abstraction. Nylo’s phenomenal voice and savvy ear for production are still front and center, but the record shows its hand a little more. While <i>Memories Speak</i> suggested an artist with strong pop instincts, <i>Indigo Summer</i> often seems more like the work of someone with substantial musical talent and an eye for aesthetic details who doesn't have much to say. Nylo is drawn to signifiers -- Audrey Hepburn, the movie<i> Donnie Darko</i> -- that are such familiar tropes of cool that they have been smoothed out to near meaninglessness. Her musical approach is also surface-level, approximating the airy formlessness of neo soul in a secondhand way, leading to wispy R&amp;B that sounds pretty but feels indecisive. A joyless cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7719-robin-thicke/"" target=""_blank"">Robin Thicke</a>’s summer smash “Blurred Lines” demonstrates the shortcomings of this style most clearly, abandoning the original’s crisp, carefree funk in favor of tepid, drawn-out vocal meandering and a contrived, theatrical tension.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While Nylo may be very much part of a trend rather than dictating it, she still is delivering more realized music than many of her blog-friendly peers due to both her airy voice and an instinct for hooks. Smoldering first single “Fool Me Once” ambitiously layers in chiming synthesizers and a propulsive drumbeat, but its most sublime moments are the simple “woo-oo-oos” that highlight her vocal clarity. The similarly regretful “Take It Back” concludes with elaborate backing vocal flourishes over a martial drumbeat as the Destiny’s Child-like chorus ostensibly remains the focus of the song. Then there's “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”, which flips its movie-title conceit into a rather wonderful image of lost-love obsession, as Nylo reaches a pinnacle of vocal potential on the straining chorus of “lately I’ve been thinking about you.” It’s deeply satisfying to hear her hit these high notes, which constitute the album’s purest moment of emotion.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nylo’s at her most effective when she trusts her emotional ideas instead of leaning on concept, a point driven home by the lackluster collaborations with the album’s two big producer names, Tricky Stewart and Fisticuffs. The latter's “Cocaine Hearts” delivers its warning about addiction by making living fast and dying young sound grating and incredibly boring. At these moments, <i>Indigo Summer</i>’s on-the-nose approach exposes its lack of substance and distracts from the way in which it’s best enjoyed: as an aesthetically pleasing feat of design, the work of a talented person with good taste still figuring out how to translate those things into something more.</p></div>"|18345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18345-nylo-indigo-summer/|6.6|Kyle Kramer

He was Johnny Cash’s most trusted stagehand, a drinking buddy of Tanya Tucker, and he served as a sound engineer for director Robert Altman’s Oscar-nominated <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Music City masterpiece</a>. And when, toward the end of the decade, Chance decided to make the leap from being an assistant to the stars to becoming one himself, he had no less a Nashville legend than <a href=""http://www.cowboyjackclement.com/discography/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Cowboy” Jack Clement</a> behind the boards. There was just one thing holding Chance back from certain country-music celebrity: The music he made sounded like absolutely nothing else coming out of Nashville at the time, or anywhere else in America for that matter.</p>
<p>Even by the standards of lost cult classics, Chance’s 1981 debut album, <i>In Search</i>, was so overlooked when it was released that it may as well have never existed. (And, according to Wikipedia, it still doesn't). Recorded piecemeal over a span of five years in a kitted-out home studio-cum-clubhouse located above Martins’ parents’ garage, the album was initially issued through a private-press run that barely cracked triple digits. But <i>In Search</i> defies the romantic, outsider-art associations that so often get attached to amateur DIY recording projects, whether it’s that of unassuming innocents naively chasing pop-star aspirations (see: The Shaggs), or day-jobbers living out their rock ‘n’ roll fantasies on a blue-collar budget (see: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"" target=""_blank"">Guided by Voices</a>).<i> In Search</i>, by contrast, is a master-class in the art of Going For It, proffering a high-concept, cinematically scaled hodgepodge of loverman soul, outlaw country, blaxpoitation funk, arena-rock pyrotechnics, and Zappa-esque meta-prog that sounds just as confounding and bizarre today as it no doubt did to the few who got to hear it 32 years ago.</p>
<p>On first approach, you could be forgiven for thinking this was all a big elaborate ruse, like some salvaged mid-90s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"" target=""_blank"">Ween</a> album released under a pseudonym. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #222222; font-family: Georgia,serif;"">(Indeed, <i>Chocolate and Cheese</i> chestnuts like ""Take Me Away"" and ""Voodoo Lady"" would sound right at home here.) <b></b></span> As a singer, Chance makes for a good auctioneer, with a lower-register sing-speak that frequently degenerates into the sort of improvised, self-aggrandizing spiel Jon Spencer would no doubt appreciate; when hitched to the rolling and tumbling rhythms of “High Test” and the “Peter Gunn” pastiche “Sunn of Gunn"", Chance comes off less as bandleader than the booze-blitzed conductor of a runaway train that’s perilously close to careening off the rails. And even when Chance cedes lead vocals to some guest female singers, his peculiar presence is still felt: the smooth, knickers-shedding soul ballad “Love by Chance” works as both a heartfelt ode to serendipitous romance, and a cheeky jingle for his own imaginary brand of aphrodisiac perfume. </p>
<p>But while Chance is fond of joking, this album is no joke. As <i>In Search</i> plays out, it becomes increasingly clear that the record’s scatterbrained eclecticism and frantic energy is less a product of eccentricity-for-eccentricity’s sake than a manifestation of the very real anxieties fuelling this endeavor. For all the musical bravado on display here (the climactic guitar solos on “Angel” and “Drema” are practically “Comfortably Numb”-worthy), Chance’s lyrics continually suggest his failure is certain (“everyone tells me I’m a loser”; “I’m on the outside looking in”; “the buzzards flying high over me”), and that this record amounts to a knowing act of career suicide, if not the prelude to a real one. (In this light, the “give you all the love that I can” hook of “Mr. Freedom Man” seems less the command of a horny superhero than the delusional fantasy of an insecure Clark Kent.)</p>
<p><i>In Search</i> hits its delirious peak with “Dead Medley,” a shot of southern-rock funk that ruminates on the deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Holly, and Hank Williams while extrapolating liberal quotes from The Doors’ “When the Music’s Over” to emphasize the do-or-die stakes at play here; in Chance’s hands, Jim Morrison’s “cancel my subscription to the resurrection” becomes “cancel my subscription to the <i>Rolling Stone</i>,” as if he were already resigned to his wholesale rejection by the rock establishment. <i>In Search</i>’s swift slip into oblivion didn’t exactly ruin Chance-- he continues to record today under the alias of <a href=""http://www.alamojonesmusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alamo Jones</a> and, for the past eight years, he and Clement have hosted a popular country-music radio show on Sirius XM. But now that his most painstaking, singular musical achievement has been rescued from history’s dustbin, Chance is in a much better position to answer a question he asks himself deep into <i>In Search</i>: “Have you ever felt like a loser until you win”?</p></div>"|18311.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18311-chance-in-search/|7.7|Stuart Berman

Songs outlining the perils of trafficking narcotics were heard next to those inspired by romance novelist Nicholas Sparks’ <i>The Notebook</i> and the <i>Twilight</i> series. In street rap, a fixation on romance is often seen as a mark against the artist’s perceived toughness, as if the one gives the lie to the other. But the weathered rasp of Gates' voice lent a measure of grit to the love songs even as it made the deterministic criminality elsewhere in the tape feel lived-in. He's has since inked a deal with Atlantic Records (who summarily squished the 22-song tape into a digital EP) and released the low-stakes digital album <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i>. Where <i>The Luca Brasi Story</i>’s itinerant sprawl and plentiful guest appearances played like a game of show and prove, <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i> whittles things down to a series of pithy two- to three-minute nuggets that lurch toward resolution, often finding it within a verse or two.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The accomplished tunefulness of <i>Luca Brasi</i> highlights “Paper Chasers” and “Neon Lights” is pushed to the margins here. Save for the hooky despondency of late-album gem “Don’t Know What to Call It”, <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i>’s Kevin Gates is world-weary in all the spots where he was starry-eyed and reflective the last time around. Whether the tense shift in his songwriting is a conscious attempt to put some distance between himself and his trap house hook-men contemporaries or a function of him stockpiling melodies for a future mainstream push, his knack for detailed, despairing storytelling cogently picks up the slack.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Stranger Than Fiction</i> draws much of its gravitas from Gates’ own colorful back story: he cuts through the airy synths and open spaces of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15664-kevin-gates-430-am/"" target=""_blank"">“4:30AM”</a> with a travelogue of betrayal for which he’s as much a culprit as a victim, and on “4 Legs and a Biscuit”, a viewing of the gangster flick <i>King of New York</i> trips off a broadside about the constant strain of legal woes. “Tiger” elaborates on the period when he quit dealing drugs to pursue a career in rap, only to fall prey to a series of janky promoters and label executives whose shifty machinations made him the vic instead of the villain. <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i> is a litany of near-misses with police and armed foes interspersed with emotionally guarded examinations of the trust issues they leave as collateral damage. But where Gates has pulled back from the emotional heft that made <i>Luca Brasi</i> such a compelling character composite, he’s poured his energy into the mechanics of rhyming with such fervor that what’s being said in these songs is often trumped for intrigue by the way he says it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While Gates’ stories suggest a battle-damaged cynic, his restless wordplay gives voice to the excitable language nerd beneath the gruff exterior. “Die About It” effortlessly switches up cadences mid-flow, shifting from a laconic swing to a sparse, staccato yelp and back. On “Careful”, he goofily adopts three different Southern accents in two verses, only one of which is his own. “MYB” reduces his voice to a guttural whisper, rendering the song’s callous dress-down of a lesser criminal all the more diabolical in the process. Gates sells all of these experiments with the same verve, and the album scarcely misses a mark until <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a> hits the buzzerbeater on the album closing remix of Gates’ 2012 single “Satellites” with a wastepaper-basket-deep verse delivered in a bratty yawp grossly ill-suited to the rest of the song.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The success of <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i> is as much a result of keen lyricism and inventive vocal tricks as good editing. Its 14 tracks are over and done in just a little more than 40 minutes. The brevity and the relatively monochromatic production, a glut of foreboding minor key trap beats, collude to force the spotlight on Gates’ versatile rapping. From the achy old gunshot wound that flares up after Gates gets stabbed and the glass of Sprite that’s purple instead of pink because he overdid it on the promethazine on “4:30AM” to the Popeyes dinner that lends the title to “4 Legs and a Biscuit” to the punch in the face that doesn’t hurt on “MYB” and the succession cars he laments not being able to drive on “Don’t Know What to Call It”, the record's uncompromising hard luck street narratives are dispensed with a preternaturally sharp eye for detail that dabs Gates’ economic writing with a shock of much-needed color.</p></div>"|18336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18336-kevin-gates-stranger-than-fiction/|7.6|Craig Jenkins

That effort's subsequent ""no synths"" trilogy tweaked misconceptions about the author's voice (2004's entirely Merritt-sung <i>i</i>), Jesus and Mary Chain-level fuzz (2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11049-distortion/"">Distortion</a></i>), and organic folksiness (2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13876-realism/""><i>Realism</i></a>). Last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16360-the-magnetic-fields-love-at-the-bottom-of-the-sea/""><i>Love at the Bottom of the Sea</i></a> was a return to synths and longtime label home Merge, but not quite to form.</p>
<p>With Merritt's main gig in a relative slump, it's reasonable to wonder if he's currently subverting assumptions by saving his best material for less-famous projects. In fact, 2011's odds-and-ends collection <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15773-obscurities/""><i>Obscurities</i></a>, released under the songwriter's own name, is much more rewarding than the last couple of Magnetic Fields albums. And Merritt's records with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3812-the-6ths/"" target=""_blank"">the 6ths</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5028-the-gothic-archies/"" target=""_blank"">the Gothic Archies</a> certainly have their ardent fans. His third album with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1591-future-bible-heroes/"" target=""_blank"">Future Bible Heroes</a>, <i>Partygoing</i>, is available either individually or as part of a remastered collection of the synth-pop outfit's back catalogue, so it's tempting to hope that Merritt is once again flouting audience anticipations. Maybe the Magnetic Fields was the lesser project all along, right?</p>
<p>Wrong, unfortunately. Although the Future Bible Heroes' first outing since 2002's uneven <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3253-eternal-youth/""><i>Eternal Youth</i></a> does offer up slightly more catchy melodies and deadpan quotables than <i>Love at the Bottom of the Sea</i> (outside of brilliantly funny <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12971-andrew-in-drag/"">""Andrew in Drag""</a> or tenderly furious ""Quick!""). The Future Bible Heroes have always combined Merritt's tunes and lyrics with the 80s-minded electronic arrangements of Chris Ewen, a Boston DJ and former keyboardist for Seymour Stein signees Figures on a Beach; Magnetic Fields member Claudia Gonson also adds drolly conversational vocals. The technology was more immediate this time, the process more collaborative-- ""We used to be the Smiths and now we're the early Beatles,"" Merritt told <a href=""http://soundcheck.wnyc.org/2013/aug/05/future-bible-heroes-in-studio/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WNYC's <i>Soundcheck</i></a>-- but the results are largely the same: <i>Partygoing</i> is an oddball record full of moments that ought to make Merritt devotees knowingly nudge their neighbors, but its pleasures are too esoteric and too kitschy to recommend to any poor souls who still haven't heard 1994's wonderful <i>Holiday</i> or <i>The Charm of the Highway Strip</i>.</p>
<p>One irony noted here has been the contrast between <i>Partygoing</i>'s title and the bleak themes of its songs, but Merritt knows how to make your head spin: The album's at its best when the death and depravity are actually kinda funny. ""Keep Your Children in a Coma"" trolls the ""Merritt is cranky!"" jerks with his wry observation, ""Dude, they have to use computers just to sing,"" but its cheerful send-up of the latest generation's over-parenting lands like a military-grade helicopter. Merritt-led ""Sadder Than the Moon"", one of a few songs here that touch on aging, yearns gracefully from the perspective of someone in a room filled hoarder-style with books, records, and dolls: ""Crazy for you, darling,"" you come to suspect, is right.</p>
<p>Just as representative of the album, though, are the songs that are tinged with offbeat humor but are also somewhat flawed. ""Drink Nothing But Champagne"", which ingeniously notes how the bubbly stuff ""makes life shorter than drinking water"" and will help you ""never say no to love,"" also dips into Momus-like excesses-- see Merritt's super-goofy David Bowie and Aleister Crowley impressions. Meanwhile, how much you chuckle at ""How Very Strange"", a duet between Merritt and Gonson on an album where one or the other usually takes the lead, seems crucial. Through the dirge-like murk, Gonson remarks on the absurdity of a relationship, while Merritt responds with increasingly ridiculous ways he made the relationship happen (""aphrodysia"" leads to ""anesthesia"" leads to ""I put a little heroin ... in everything you took in""). Truly, Rick Ross: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50291-reebok-drops-rick-ross-due-to-rape-controversy/"">U.O.E.N.O</a>.</p>
<p>At other times, though, <i>Partygoing</i> could benefit from a little bit more party. Slow-motion lament of sorts ""Satan, Your Way Is a Hard One"" is a hard one to stay awake through. Gonson delivers some quintessential Merritt on brief, Shirley Bassey-worthy opener ""A Drink Is Just the Thing"", but her chipper suicide-pact call on ""Let's Go to Sleep (and Never Come Back"") is more interesting-- as with so many recent Merritt projects-- in theory than in practice. So, too, with the songs that more topically address recent years' economic inequality, such as the vaguely Eastern-tinged, Merritt-sung ""Love Is a Luxury I Can No Longer Afford"" and Gonson's pounding, elf-free ""Digging My Own Grave"" (""What money I shall save!""). At 13 tracks, most three minutes or shorter,  it's not a long record, but it often feels that way.</p>
<p>Merritt is fighting ear troubles, so he hasn't been touring with the Future Bible Heroes, which would seem to further diminish expectations-- and thus raise the chances of dramatically exceeding them. In another unpredictable turn, though, Merritt <i>has</i> taken the stage with the ensemble, now and then, to perform a couple of songs on acoustic instruments. One older number in the repertoire is ""I'm Lonely (And I Love It)"", a 2002 EP track compiled with the past albums on Merge's<i> Memories Of Love, Eternal Youth, And Partygoing</i>. The narrator should be morose, but he's happy; the backing is similarly ebullient. It's a fine song, with a self-aware lyric about ""records you'd never let me buy."" As with <i>Partygoing</i>, though, I don't love it. And unlike in Merritt's songs, there's no paradoxical twist I can go through that can really make me feel the opposite.</p></div>"|18337.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18337-future-bible-heroes-partygoing/|6.3|Marc Hogan

Power pop and bar rock bands work from a sort of creative commons of riffs and bass lines: There's the ""Shake Some Action"", the ""Lust for Life"", the ""American Girl"". You can hear a few of these old chestnuts echoing around in <i>Sunken</i>, Twin Peaks' newly re-released mini-LP. When there is so much agreeable stuff lying around, all of it worn shiny with generations' worth of love, to make someone actually pay attention to <i>you</i> requires real talent, and Twin Peaks have perfected the kind of songwriting that puts you in a practiced, happy headlock.</p>
<p><i>Sunken</i> is less than twenty minutes long, but it packs a lot of color and verve into that blink of an eye. ""Out of Commission"" occupies a minute and 25 seconds of precious running time but it still finds a moment to burn a joyfully squalled miniature <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14178-thin-lizzy/"" target=""_blank"">Thin Lizzy</a> guitar solo onto the song's surface. The four of them-- lead singer and guitarist Cadien Lake James, Connor Brodnor, Clay Frankel, and Jack Dolan-- have been playing together since high school, and they've developed a sharp melodic ear, a knack that pops up in their arrangements as often as in their vocal melodies. Almost every guitar note on this album is hummable: ""Baby Blue"" cycles between a chiming, wintergreen riff and another squiggled lead, this one reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a>' Nick Valensi. ""Ocean Blue"" wraps a tight little cluster of shimmery notes around the chord progression, flickering around Cadien Lake James' slow-moving vocal line.</p>
<p>As a singer, Cadien displays a few vaguely <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7320-julian-casablancas/"" target=""_blank"">Julian Casablancas</a>-like vocal affectations-- the gulp, a drunken slur. He sings some endearingly dumb things: ""I never used to dig the sunshine much until I smoked some marijuana, yeah"", from ""Boomers"". But his voice crawls up higher, and breaks more joyfully, than Casablancas's, and he has a surprising range: On the airy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15673-twin-peaks-irene/"" target=""_blank"">""Irene""</a>, he sings in a tender, fey, high register, ooh-ing wordlessly over watery guitars. It's an album highlight, and the kind of song you write when you intend to become something other than a sloppy garage-pop band someday.</p>
<p>An obvious touchstone for Twin Peaks, all of whom are nineteen years old, is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28000-the-smith-westerns/"" target=""_blank"">the Smith Westerns</a>, who hit a similar melodic guitar-rock sweet spot with 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15016-dye-it-blonde/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dye it Blonde</i></a> and then spent the next couple of years reeling slightly, probably never having imagined themselves as elder statesmen of anything. (Cadien James' older brother dropped out of high school to be Smith Westerns' touring drummer.) And like that band's recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18110-the-smith-westerns-soft-will/"" target=""_blank""><i>Soft Will</i></a>, <i>Sunken</i> vigorously applies lo-fi sandpaper to laminate-gloss songwriting, gumming up songs that otherwise click along smoothly on multiple levels. <i>Sunken</i> presents itself initially as an over-enthusiastic tumble, an overgrown lab puppy licking your face. They are kid-bro Smith Westerns, figuratively and literally. But <i>Sunken</i> hints at more than that.</p></div>"|18285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18285-twin-peaks-sunken/|7.1|Jayson Greene

Following a debut EP whose reliance on submerged samples smacked of chillwave, Eriksen signed to Kompakt for his more distinctive first LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16738-tipped-bowls/""><i>Tipped Bowls</i></a>, where he expanded his software synths with limber analog hardware. It was a sunny and delightful deluge of clear but unusual shapes, with rich, high-contrast timbres and granulated rhythms swarming around house beats both implied and explicit. The Kompakt contract presumably goes on, and <i>Nothing Hype</i>, released on Eriksen's own Wyrd imprint, feels like a stopgap until then. It's billed as a ""mini-LP,"" though ironically, the longer <i>Tipped Bowls</i> got more into the miniature spirit. That almost demented level of fine detail thins out into broader strokes on <i>Nothing Hype</i>, an agreeable but less unique record.</p>
<p>To get a sense of the difference between <i>Tipped Bowls</i> and <i>Nothing Hype</i>, check out each of their atmospheric opening tracks. On the former's ""Four Legged"", a panning notch smears a tone cluster as sub-rhythms bubble through, while on the latter's ""With Me"", a delayed chord progression glides along in a stately fashion, the accents accumulating on the beats instead of whirling and scattering across them. On the first, there always seem to be 10 things happening at once, while on the other, nothing much happens at all. This atypical complacency is elsewhere most apparent on ""PUR 1"", where a rubbery attack builds toward little more than some flanged harmonies and jammy synth intervals. These are smoothly pumping pistons, but Eriksen neglected to festoon them with tiny moving parts.</p>
<p>Absent that intricacy, the dance tracks are the most engaging and liberated-feeling ones. The prancing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15516-taragana-pyjarama-rar/"">""RAR""</a>, lush and sultry in the manner of  Dutch producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28238-applescal/"">Applescal</a>, is enriched by lingering harmonies that erratically well up, though it's hard to pick out any decisive climax or shift in their seven minutes of variable iteration. ""Touching"" makes for a dynamic highlight, though it sharply recalls a tamed version of ""Ribbons"" by professed Eriksen influence <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>. That leaves only ""Beam"", where a gently wobbling instrumental doesn't rise to the dramatic level of the vocalist, Kicki Halmos, and ""Lore (Merged)"", a small afterthought of a crescendo. <i>Nothing Hype</i> sets out its modest aims in its title, and the exploded diagrams of <i>Tipped Bowls</i> settle back into something more diagrammatic. It's a nice listen but not a very idiosyncratic one; one trusts that Eriksen is simply skimming off the top of his creative reservoir, already proven to be deep, until his next proper LP.</p></div>"|18301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18301-taragana-pyjarama-nothing-hype/|6.0|Brian Howe

His day-glo personality is called Clockwork; a 22-year-old with big-room, mega-club house bangers like his jacked remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30466-avicii/"" target=""_blank"">Avicii</a>’s “Levels” that hat-tips the fusion dance genre of moombahton while shoveling in heaps of electro to sidestep along the way. As Clockwork, Steinway has pulled production aesthetics from and played alongside house staples (like Avicii or Afrojack) while mining through indie-hip EDM scenes fostered by A-Trak’s Fool’s Gold and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5636-steve-aoki/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Aoki</a>’s Dim Mak imprint. He embraces trancy synth build-ups and uses chainsaw revs and electro-burping tech-house that’s fistpump ready even if it’s made with mosh-pits in mind. <a href=""http://www.rlgrime.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RL Grime</a>, however, is a totally different animal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s easiest to present RL Grime as Steinway’s grittier, more ominous alter-ego. One with trap prowess, catering more to stomps than pumps. And RL Grime really is all about that life; he fiddles with the bass and messes with tightly-wound beats, pulling away from the explosive, emotionally manipulative pandering of his EDM counterpart. But the mega-club mentality hasn’t completely escaped him. With his remix of Benny Benassi’s chart-topping hit “Satisfaction” last year, the producer wound down the shrill, whining melody to use as fodder for frantic bass blips and sexily sauntering snares. The idea of mimicking overbearing pop melodies with syncopated horns and strategically placed beats flips the song on its head. It also represents one of the producer’s greatest talents: his ability to restructure songs entirely without losing the drama of soaring dance melodies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And so <i>High Beams</i><i>’</i> strongest points showcase the ease in which Steinway can use this technique crossover to straight rap production. Last year’s <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/salva/mercy-rl-grime-salva-rmx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Mercy” remix</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29376-salva/"" target=""_blank"">Salva</a> immediately comes to mind upon hearing “CliqCliq”, the duo’s collaboration for this EP. Like “Mercy”, the hit-sampled track is catchy, clappy, and sinister. Pitchy synths wail over staticy beats and a loopy, buzzing drone that could easily drive a person insane was it not complemented with the menacing, echoing thuds of static that push the song forward. “Secondary” features Compton based rapper Problem for what turns out to be the most complete, radio-ready track on the EP; a testament of where RL Grime could head if he was so inclined.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Elements from Clockwork remain as well. “Pockets,” the album’s intro, tempers his hip-hop instrumentation with lush laser-like synths that pan over ping-pong drum-rim rhythms and bouncing MPC beats. “Shells” gives in a little more to the tropes, becoming a moonbounce of elastic synths that wind up, scream out, and boomerang around the song.  As with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30453-baauer/"" target=""_blank"">Baauer</a>-- a recent tour-mate and fellow Fool’s Gold/Mad Decent affiliate-- this balance of rap’s bump-n-grind groove and EDM’s flashiness helps prevent an artist from getting swallowed by the glut of the recent trap craze. But where Baauer is putting in work to show that he can also do house (by stripping down Disclosure’s “You &amp; Me”) and ravey festival show-stoppers (his collab with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7025-just-blaze/"" target=""_blank"">Just Blaze</a> for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Z</a> sampled “Higher”), Steinway has no need. In turn the producer’s <i>High Beams</i> EP serves not only as RL Grime’s debut EP on Fool's Gold but as a window into where RL Grime and Clockwork meet.</p></div>"|18327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18327-rl-grime-high-beams-ep/|6.8|Puja Patel

Tapping into a strain of noisy, shadowy post-punk, it succeeded largely because of its texture. Carried on waves of serrated guitar, it was not only bracingly cathartic on headphones, but captivating, malleable, and very loud on the stage. Weekend did wisely tour it extensively, recording only a five-song EP,  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15843-red-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Red</i></a>, in the three years since. Some of the material on <i>Red</i> reflected the image of a band whose ears might need a break; though it still sounded like the work of the guys who gave us <i>Sports</i>, it hinted at a cleaner, glossier update of their sound.</p>
<p>On their second LP, <i>Jinx</i>, Weekend are still working with a strong palette of blacks and grays. But where <i>Sports</i>' only light was the mineral glint of smeared charcoal, <i>Jinx</i> has a reflective, acrylic gloss to it. Expanding from a trio to a four-piece after hiring bassist Nick Ray, frontman Shaun Durkan moved his band to Brooklyn in the wake of a family death that found him seeking therapy. Still bleak, but surprisingly spirited and indebted to new wave, this newfound clarity and change of scenery has had an impact on the band: Weekend have put together a record that's begging to be played to more ears in bigger spaces. Like their arena-goth forebearers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">the Cure</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a>, they're making lucid, pop-conscious moves, focusing on melody and cleaner sonics to contrast the doubt, melancholy, and occasional tenderness already present.</p>
<p>During<i> Jinx</i>'s hook-minded first half, Weekend nearly pull off the transformation. With its buoyant low-end and surprisingly straightforward guitar work, opener and first single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15232-mirror/"" target=""_blank"">""Mirror""</a> is an obvious indication of Weekend's commitment to reshaping their sound. While the torrents of noise are missed, Durkan and company prove that they have the songwriting chops to make up for it. ""July"" is a step further in the right direction, managing to capture the balmy freedom of summer's favorite month without alienating what could be <a href=""http://gothsinhotweather.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the track's core constituency</a>. It only takes a few listens for choruses to open up, with ""Oubielete"" pulling off a rare trick in that it sounds like a lost 1980s college radio staple that, despite not having been heard in years, feels like it never went away. (You could say the same for the big-beat anchored ""Celebration, FL"", but it's more likely thanks to the fact that it just sounds like a really bummed-out cover of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6FBfAQ-NDE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Just Can't Get Enough""</a>.)</p>
<p>But as good as some of these songs are, you can't help but shake the feeling that they could be <i>better</i>. Production-wise, <i>Jinx</i> needs more oomph; merely cleaning up your sound doesn't maximize your songs' inherent potential. And, while these songs are often memorable, some fine-tuning could have pushed them over the top. No one's saying the band has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2368-the-killers/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Killers</a>-sized aspirations, but if they want these songs to play in the rafters the same way they play right up against the monitors, they'll need to make basic, proper adjustments. It's commendable Durkan's un-fuzzed his voice and made strides to spend <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1349722/weekend-frontman-shaun-durkan-talks-about-the-turmoil-that-ultimately-inspired-sophomore-album-jinx/interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""a lot more time on the lyrics this time around""</a> (though stuff like ""I feel sick, sick, sick, sick, sick/ In my heart"" and ""I want to save you from the world"" may suggest that more work is needed), but he doesn't inflect enough gusto in his vocals to make the promise of big, truly riveting choruses a reality.</p>
<p>One of the problems with <i>Red</i> was how quickly Weekend were willing to pull back from that early intensity-- for every <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv7JFOLVQe8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hazel""</a>, there was something like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DqJKR3VRnA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Your Own Nothing""</a>. Unfortunately, the back half of <i>Jinx</i> feels like even more of a retreat. Moving away from the more varied songcraft that speckled the record's earlier tracks, <i>Jinx</i> eventually resigns itself to a pillowy darkness that, while not unpleasant, feels safe and flat. ""Sirens"" is the kind of shoegaze track that finds itself staring into the wall instead of the floor, and before you notice, you too have been peering blankly into oblivion for three minutes. There are little takeaways that help steady things, with ""It's Alright"" blowing fairy dust all over the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28699-the-soft-moon/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Soft Moon</a>'s post-industrial vibes, but by the time you reach too-long closer ""Just Drive"", you just feel in need of a stretch.</p></div>"|18296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18296-weekend-jinx/|6.9|Zach Kelly

But the way their aesthetic trickles down to its members' side projects provides an interesting angle on their approach. Lead singer/guitarist Stephen McBean’s debut album with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18136-grim-tower-anarchic-breezes/"">Grim Tower</a> is the most recent example, combining strains of bluegrass with pitch black psychedelic textures to create a “new acoustic death folk” ensemble with former Yeah Yeah Yeah’s guitarist Imaad Wasif. Lightning Dust, comprised of Black Mountain vocalist Amber Webber and drummer Joshua Wells, is probably the most accomplished BM satellite. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lightning Dust cues from their parent band in some ways-- maintaining a wistful veil of doomy, occasionally inscrutable, psychedelia-- but without the bombast. They've also calibrated their songwriting to include electronic flourishes in the vein of minimalist electronic legends Suicide, and shades of 1970s FM soft rock like Fleetwood Mac, with Webber’s gorgeous voice providing an eerie parallel to Stevie Nicks’ howl. On <i>Fantasy</i>, Lightning Dust’s third studio album, Webber and Wells have polished and foregrounded the once-peripheral synths and drum machines. So while the duo’s 70s pop influences remain relatively intact, the small scale prog rock oddities that permeated 2008's <i>Infinite Light</i> are discarded for chilly, art-disco sheen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the album's glossy production proves to be an awkward fit for Webber’s elegantly weird harmonies and impressionistic lyricism. Where the band once drew energy from the friction created by her cryptic vocals butting up against the rigid grid of driving synths, there are too many instances on <i>Fantasy</i> where the electronics dominate, throwing the sound out of balance. “Mirror” in particular is beautifully sung song trapped inside shiny, bland production, with cheap sounding skittering 808’s and percolating percussion. And “In the City Tonight” squanders another ethereal Webber performance with listless keyboards and a-rhythmic drum machines pattering pointlessly in the background.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sometimes the duo’s newly developed sound clicks into place, like when the brittle electronic beats link up with Webber’s lyrics on the industrial-tinged “Loaded Gun”, but even then we lose the most distinctive parts of Webber’s croon. Her voice is unique, to the point that it needs only a haunting keyboard line or acoustic riff to complete a song. The album's inconsistency can be attributed to Lightning Dust's desire to<i> </i>add additional wrinkles to their well-worn psych rock/ 70s pop mix. And while it's hard to fault a band for branching out beyond their established template, the tidy electronic textures of <i>Fantasy </i>don't begin to match the mysterious depths of Lightning Dust's best work.</p></div>"|18228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18228-lightning-dust-fantasy/|5.5|Patrick Bowman

It's an anxious sound, the soundtrack of impatiently waiting, of staying clear of a powerful, inevitable force that could crush you. The jing-jing-jing of this lasts for the nearly four minutes of the album opener ""Aching Bones"", a dark droning concoction of martial drums, blown-out bass, and pricks of parlor piano. All is static until <a href=""http://nadineshah.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nadine Shah</a> arrives and unfurls her velvet voice, singing of a love that destroys-- and setting the tone for a dark record that does not relent.</p>
<p>Much of Shah's press attention's referenced some fantasy patrilineage, that she sounds like the product of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"" target=""_blank"">PJ Harvey</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Cave</a> union. Like Harvey, she sounds mournful, powerstrutting between lust and vengeance-- regardless of what she's singing about; the sang-froid and cruelty that cut through <i>Dum and Mad</i> is perhaps where the Cave's distilled from. But Shah's actual lineage sheds more light on her sound: growing up Shah's Pakistani father sang Urdu ghazals around the house, a form of Arabic poetry about love and loss. Most every song on <i>Dum and Mad</i> is about a love that was, a past that poisons the future, and being undone by the true nature of a love. She sings in the now about what went wrong-- the memory propelling the misery. </p>
<p>The album's second single, ""Dreary Town"", a recollection Shah wrote of an ex-boyfriend two days after his suicide-- one of two dead friends she pays tribute to with the album-- is just about it's only point of light, though in a backwards sort of way. ""I'm not going to follow you to the ground,"" Shah sings. In the first verse she outlines what they had as kids, broke but happy and in love in London. Unlike the rest of the songs, she's not yearning for what they had. The track has an odd melancholy to it, a looping 3/4 of vibes and music box melody, lonely guitar notes-- it sounds like a carousel. All the little details get swallowed up in the natural reverb (half the album was recorded in a textile warehouse, including this track). The din rises around the hiccuping rhythm, until Shah lets loose-- the jagged vibrato at the top of her range recalling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1672-diamanda-galas/"" target=""_blank"">Diamanda Galás</a> at points-- as her voice comes to full power. ""Darling, I'm leaving,"" she howls, all emotion but still in total control of her voice, smearing the words for a measure. She's choosing to live-- that's all she can do now. </p>
<p>On ""To Be a Young Man"", she sings as a man with his youth and all it's privilege and ease far behind him. ""Oh to be a young man again,"" she sings drawing the ""o"" long in her Northern accent, moaning distress until it almost sounds a little obscene. ""There were hopes and dreams that we locked up and hid,"" she intones. Her voice is rapturous, the desperation in her voice allowing her inhabit characters completely-- whether she's playing the venomous housewife of the nearly perfect ""Runaway"" or the pliant lover on ""All I Want"", boasting ""I'm all that you want.""</p>
<p><i>Dum and Mad</i> is blood-red gothic, desperate loves, and bitterness-- much more fully-fledged than you'd expect a debut to be. Producer Ben Hillier doesn't carve out a lot of space for Shah in the songs, but she takes it. The sound of the album is heavy, claustrophobic even; reflecting the subject matter, sounds double back, pile up, and refuse to fade. The arrangements are simple, usually just piano, bass, guitar, drums, and some bits of feedback or guitar scuzz saturating the mix for emphasis.

As a producer, his output has ridden more on the personalities of collaborators and scene compatriots than any specific character statement of his own. And the irony is that his music often feels like it comes from somewhere rather than someone. For better or worse, there's an enigmatic bubbling-up and reconfiguration of half-recalled instrumental hip-hop and beat music ideas about that feels like it can fit in a movement, but less as a driving force than a mysterious insinuation.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If that means immediacy and instant cheap thrills are sacrificed, that's a risky cost, but there's something to be said for blurry background music that comes into deep focus when you least expect it. <i>Vivid Green</i> is the latest Nobody album to explore the pleasures of subtlety and long-soak immersion, a breezy but not inconsequential recliner-beat suite with a warm-weather glow to it. There's an inert, vague sort of beauty that you have to meet halfway here, a naggingly familiar yet unplaceable assemblage that often feels like it has to be completed by the pre-existing experiences a deep listener might already have. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album's emphasis on low-key ambience doesn't keep things from knocking here and there. Airy melodies and weighty drum breaks mix well on a handful of early album tracks, like the liquid flutter of ""Third Charm"", the faucet-drip on a drumhead rumble of ""Pentwater"", or ""Flat Black"" and its subterranean cavern echo. Few of his instrumentals really come alive with an emotional heft that rises above calm head-nod reverie, the slowly cresting, invigorating triumph of the title track being a welcome exception. But like a mild narcotic or a one-pint buzz, it does feel attuned to the potential of just slightly amplifying the mellow-high qualities of an already pleasant surrounding. It's a precarious balance, and going too far in either direction between preciousness and aggression jostles things off the track a bit. The twee synth-baroque ""Rhombus"" sounds like the soundtrack to one of the more boring plot-advancement cutscenes in a mid-90s Playstation RPG, and when the record's subtle nods to trap get a bit too unsubtle on the horn-blat bombast of ""Rex"", it's hard not to hear it as an out-of-place caricature. But those mood-breaking moments are more outliers than dealbreakers, weird diversions on an otherwise consistently bucolic record.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Bucolic doesn't always make for exciting, though, which is why it's a good thing Nobody's tapped into his collaborative impulses and recruited a few vocalists to bolster the ranks and ink in the lines that the music too often simply sketches out. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2686-the-mars-volta/"" target=""_blank"">Mars Volta</a> frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala provides his voice to ""Our Last Dance"", which isn't exactly the prog-crossover move that one might expect -- it's a woozily soulful, borderline mournful downtempo psychedelic synthpop dirge that hints at either a breakup or a death but might as well be about both. Teri Gender Bender (of Bosnian Rainbows) and Anna Wise (of Sonnymoon and the hook to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s ""Real"") let their enigmatic, melody-distorting qualities pierce the half-awake goth-soul of ""Sleeping Alone"" and the disassociated Stephen Hawking namechecking g-dub of ""Spliff!"" And even if its oceanside summer vibe couldn't fit anywhere but the album's high-note end, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28739-baths/"" target=""_blank"">Baths</a>-coproduced ""Beaches"" is a choice moment, featuring a turn from Project Blowed battle-rap vet Nocando that flips convincingly between downpitched reefer-smoke zone-out and straight-up lovestruck devotion.

Try as they might, the spacemen have yet to fix the ship. Instead, they’ve passed the time with a rock group that tours incessantly, spreading warnings about the endless greed and impending catastrophe they’ve encountered on Earth with a great Pentecostal fervor. In front of swiveling riffs lovingly borrowed from Thin Lizzy, Rainbow and the like, leader Valient Himself has preached revolution and suspicion with an Iggy Pop-styled urgency, an alien trying to save himself and everyone around him from seemingly inescapable predators.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem with such origin tales is that they can sometimes overrun the actual work of the band behind them. For the last decade, Valient Thorr’s shout-out-loud anthems and frenetic live shows have often been the sidecar to their story, as it provides a ready diversion for an industry generally overloaded with narratives of four friends who met in college or found one another on Craigslist. The stranded Venusians offer intrigue. Sometimes, though, that anecdotal allure has prevented the band from being taken seriously; despite their pristine two-guitar attack and one of the most riveting frontmen around, they have been perceived as a gimmick, jokesters too taken with fantasy to commit to the reality of the world around them.</p>
<p>But as its title suggests, <i>Our Own Masters</i>-- the band’s sixth LP and first in three years-- finds Valient Thorr largely forgetting the spaceship and forgoing their skyward return for a more immediate and local redemption. Though all of Valient Thorr’s records have been, to some degree, <i>about</i> the problems of this world, <i>Our Own Masters</i> feels <i>of</i> our problems, too-- not only ready to proclaim them but also to claim them as the band’s own, issues to be stared down and solved and not simply yammered about. <i>Our Own Masters</i> is the first Valient Thorr album to feel less like a sermon than a spirited conversation.</p>
<p>They haven’t given up on the pronouncements of disgust and disappointment; “Master Collider” is a fortified hardcore sprint about apocalypse, reinvention, and salvation, a bell-tolling cry to beat back corruption with “the power to be free.” Valient Thorr even leads with an indictment on “Immaculate Consumption”, a smartly written and exuberantly delivered critique of American overspending that now seems so multigenerational and habitual that it’s hereditary. Importantly, Himself implicates <i>himself</i>, lambasting his own needs over any compulsion to help those around him. “Kick me in my grave,” he screams. “I feel like I’m fixin’ to die.” That moment of frustrated mortality suggests that Valient Thorr’s come a long way from a band that, in interviews, still embraces its interplanetary heritage.</p>
<p>Indeed, across most of <i>Our Own Masters</i>, Valient Thorr thrives upon a relatively fresh honesty and vulnerability.<i> </i>The incandescent “No Strings Attached”, for instance, offers a new benchmark for the group, finally turning “stormy weather” and “bills that we cannot pay” into launching points for solidarity and triumph. Valient Thorr’s built a worldwide network of tattooed and denim-clad “Thorriors” during their seemingly endless tours, and “No Strings Attached” finally capitalizes on that sort of fostered goodwill; it’s a love song to a world that these aliens still worry about but now belong to, and it’s one of the most winning songs they’ve ever written. The bruising “Good News Bad News”, meanwhile, finds Himself invoking Bad Brains and “counteract[ing] those who spread fear,” the thick riffs and relentless rhythm serving as the locomotive that pulls him through the awakening. He confesses that difficulties are just around the next hook, but that he’s got to take charge in dealing with them-- that is, the alien has come home to roost with his terrestrial burden, not to pass it along on someone else.</p>
<p>What’s most gratifying about this attitude shift is that it doesn’t mitigate Valient Thorr’s musical brawn; if anything, it’s only galvanized it. The 27-second sizzle of “Life Hands You Demons” and the outsized glory of “Call Off the Dogs” stand among Valient Thorr’s most riveting songs to date without standing apart from them. Self-absolved from their roles as alien emissaries and newly loaded with personal responsibility, they seem entirely recharged now, a veteran outfit bailing on one mission to start a better and more approachable one.</p></div>"|18175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18175-valient-thorr-our-own-masters/|7.6|Grayson Currin

(Also: drugs.) But Jackson Scott’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9096-jackson-scott/"">interest</a> in the troubled Pink Floyd founder goes beyond surfaces. On his debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/166-melbourne/"" target=""_blank"">Melbourne</a>, </i>the North Carolina-based singer-songwriter attempts to locate his inner Barrett, aspiring to the dark whimsy and fractured melodies of Pink Floyd’s <i>Piper at the Gates of Dawn </i>and the solo albums <i>The Madcap Laughs </i>and <i>Barrett. </i>It’s an admirable attempt at achieving a difficult goal-- for all their woozy tempos and “weird” affectations, Scott’s songs never quite reach the singularly unsettling depths of Barrett’s best music. He is, for better or worse, a different kind of artist. </p>
<p>That’s not to say that Jackson doesn’t have talent, or that <i>Melbourne </i>isn’t a winning introduction. Because he does, and the album most definitely is. Scott might not be the next Syd Barrett, but he could be a budding Rivers Cuomo. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9096-jackson-scott/"">In an interview with Pitchfork</a> back in April, Scott copped to his love of early Weezer and alt-rock in general. (While Scott’s music bears some superficial similarities with fellow southern psych-rock tunesmiths like Bradford Cox and Jeff Mangum, to whom he’s often been compared, he wasn’t weaned on Elephant 6 bands or indie-rock at all.) Sure enough, if you listen closely to <i>Melbourne, </i>what initially sounds like oddball 1960s pop gradually reveals itself to be something else. Though Scott lathers his songs in tape hiss and disembodied noise, but the songs themselves are straight-forward and hooky guitar jams.</p>
<p>Cuomo’s influence on Scott is apparent in the number of songs named women on <i>Melbourne. </i>“Evie” is one of the album’s prettiest songs, with Scott’s murmuring, wandering vocal anchored by a sturdy acoustic strum and lifted by a jangly electric lead. Also lovely is “Sandy”-- which refers to the Sandy Hook shootings-- which offsets the disturbing lyrics (“Little kids/ Sitting all around/ Wishing they were sound asleep again”) with a light shuffle and sighing backing vocals. “Sandy” is the closest that Scott gets to full-on lysergic creepiness on <i>Melbourne</i>; he’s most at home with sprawling, slow-burn rockers that climax with stunning six-string pyrotechnics. “That Awful Sound” stomps with surprising swagger after the tweeness of <i>Melbourne</i>’s opening tracks, with Scott’s smoldering guitar finally bubbling over for a searing mid-song solo. The Pixies-like “Together Forever” is a mini epic-- at 3:42, it’s the longest song on this fleet 12-track and 29-minute record-- that builds to a chorus of guitar feedback in the final minute.</p>
<p>While the melodies jump out of <i>Melbourne </i>and immediately assert themselves-- “Any Way” is the giddiest two-minute rock song you’ll hear this year-- Scott disguises his voice by pitch-shifting the vocals into various distorted shapes. It’s an intermittently successful approach, equal parts creepy and annoying, but the gimmickry adds little to the songs, which are strong enough to benefit from greater clarity and a more confident delivery. Scott already has his songwriting tools in place; once he finds his voice, look out.</p></div>"|18297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18297-jackson-scott-melbourne/|7.7|Steven Hyden

With its cover emblazoned with the visage of his greasy crotch sheathed in a zebra-print Speedo, the comp featured songs that were heavily indebted to girl groups. Bogart, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30101-hunx/"">Hunx</a>, sang about wanting to kiss somebody who just ate Del Taco on the mouth, hangin' on the telephone, and wanting to get inside Rocky's pants. On some of those tracks, Hunx had songwriting assistance from Justin Champlin, the jovial masked madman <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/THENOBUNNY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nobunny</a>. To say the least, Champlin and Bogart's early works were a natural aesthetic match, and that connection carries over to Bogart's newest Hunx album, <i>Street Punk</i>.</p>
<p>Last year, Nobunny continued his streak of power pop gems with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp7sCmXWf_8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""La La La La Love You""</a>, but shortly after that single came out, he made a sudden turn for a much more <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJIvOLfPV_o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pointedly aggro sound</a>. And now, it seems that Seth Bogart has made a similar transition. After releasing last year's ballad-lined solo effort <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16313-hairdresser-blues/""><i>Hairdresser Blues</i></a> and the girl group joy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15239-too-young-to-be-in-love/""><i>Too Young to Be in Love</i></a>, Bogart has reminded us why he calls them His Punx. <i>Street Punk</i> exhibits the same kind of shrugged off sneering, swearing, and intimidation as Nobunny's latest punk onslaught. Take ""Everyone's a Pussy (Fuck You Dude)""-- a song that's exactly 30 seconds long-- a hard-hitting cut that has an all-intimidation bass riff on the low end and features exactly six angrily screamed words. That song is proof enough that Hunx and Nobunny are still on similar wavelengths, except now, the two men owe more to G.G. Allin than Phil Spector. </p>
<p>But while the Punx may have shifted into a tougher mentality, these tracks can still be genuinely funny. ""Bad Skin"" escalates things pretty quickly by threatening to ""kill you with a knife"". Why? Because they have bad skin. Perhaps the most sly track of the bunch is ""You Think You're Tough"", where the narrator makes a gradual transition from irrational anger (""I think you're gross"") to the moment when they realize their disdain may actually be affection (""Oh no, what have I become? Am I in love?""). And like a lot of Hunx's romantic material, it's got a sweet sentiment, one not unlike <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Emma</a> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clueless_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cher</a>) arguing with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Knightley</a> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clueless_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paul Rudd</a>) until she suddenly realizes her true feelings. </p>
<p>""You Think You're Tough"" is a standout that also showcases the range of <i>Street Punk</i>, a track sung by Shannon Shaw of another great Oakland garage pop outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29627-shannon-and-the-clams/"">Shannon and the Clams</a>. On <i>Too Young to Be in Love</i>, Shannon sang back-up, and it's an extremely smart call to put her voice up front a few times. On Shannon and the Clams' LPs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18078-shannon-and-the-clams-dreams-in-the-rat-house/""><i>Dreams in the Rat House</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15336-sleep-talk/""><i>Sleep Talk</i></a>, Shaw and Cody Blanchard created a bubblegummy garage sound with a whole mess of bite. This album similarly finds strength in two voices, though <i>Street Punk</i> jumps from Bogart's nasal to Shaw's soulful rasp and back again. It's exactly what this album needs. With 12 short and fast punk tracks, it's nice to hear sonic shifts not only in tone and tempo, but also in its variety of voices.</p>
<p>Though closing track ""It's Not Easy"" goes on for nearly four minutes, the rest of <i>Street Punk</i> is appropriately brief. The whole album is just under 20 minutes long, which works well for this kind of thing. Bogart's lyrics, sense of humor, and ear for melody sound great in a bite-sized format. ""Don't Call Me Fabulous"", for example, is 25 seconds of enraged screams, and that's exactly the right amount of time for a track that's this loudly angry.<i> </i>Hunx's knack for efficient and fun brevity is a double-edged sword in its way, as the strength of <i>Gay Singles</i> could easily paint him as more of a singles guy than an artist who makes great full albums. Fortunately, Hunx's punk rock versatility has made <i>Street Punk</i> his most through-and-through entertaining full-length to date.</p></div>"|18286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18286-hunx-and-his-punx-street-punk/|7.4|Evan Minsker

On Isis' 2009 swan song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13009-wavering-radiant/""><i>Wavering Radiant</i></a>, the Los Angeles band’s increasingly accessible and grandiose doom metal started to sound like blown-out Deftones instrumentals, whereas Deftones’ increasingly lush and knotty alt-metal could pass for compressed Isis. So <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11889-palms/"">Palms</a> is a sensible pairing, a partnership between Deftones vocalist Chino Moreno and three members of Isis (drummer Aaron Harris, guitarist Cliff Meyer, and bassist Jeff Caxide) that promises a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"">Postal Service</a>-like mutual benefit: those responsible for the backing music get a tremendous profile boost, while the lead singer is granted a modicum of cred that wrongly escapes his main band, whose diverse and progressive catalog still gets stereotyped as caricatured teen angst. It's an exciting proposition for fans of both Isis and Deftones, but more because of what might result for the participating musicians than the resulting music. On <i>Palms</i>, the underlying parts fit together so smoothly that there's never any friction that could lead to a spark.</p>
<p>Based on advance single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15371-palms-patagonia/"">""Patagonia""</a>, Palms has been dubbed “dream metal”, which isn't very accurate: expect to temper your expectations based on the “metal” part, which is clearly tacked on due to reputation. <i>Palms</i> never rocks, at least not in a way that places physical demands on the listener. Moreover, while the lugubrious tempos and luxurious production ensures there’s always presence and body to <i>Palms</i>, there isn’t much heft. In fact, fast forward to “Tropics” and see how literal Moreno gets with the lyrics: “I kiss you goodbye/ And release in the sky/ I stare in your core/ As you rush from the shore.” Whereas Deftones' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVMfISO9T1Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">“Knife Prty”</a>or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDy4V2Mmm-c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">“Romantic Dreams”</a> maintained an edge of consensual danger that allowed both sensuality and sexuality, ""Tropics"" suggests Moreno may be using Palms to follow his makeout music muse to an endpoint of chillwave.<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif;""><br/></span></p>
<p>Which is promising in a sense; at least you know <i>Palms </i>isn’t entirely redundant. But it’s more so than you might think. Glistening opener “Future Warrior” isn’t all that far off from Deftones’ more sensitive and balmy recent work-- think <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67oBykAKUuk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Entombed”</a> from <i>Koi No Yokan, </i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0pdwd0miqs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Sextape”</a> from <i>Diamond Eyes. </i>But without as much verse/chorus guidance, the six songs on <i>Palms </i>often stretch out past seven minutes, taking as much time as possible to get nowhere in particular. The titles are more new age than nu-metal, so it’s obvious they’re meant to accompany some sort of spiritual journey rather than guide you through a visceral one. </p>
<p>It’s the sort of work most would call “exploratory,"" except both parties are locked into defined and familiar roles from the very beginning. Meyer can spin silvery riffs at will, slicked with delay and reverb, pinging around the stereo field. But once you’ve heard him do it once on “Future Warrior"", you’ve more or less heard <i>Palms </i>in its entirety. The only notable shifts in texture are the result of <i>additional </i>delay and reverb, such as the anti-gravity, post-rock reverie that closes out “Antarctic Handshake” or the encroaching humidity achieved on “Tropics”.</p>
<p>Moreno is every bit as complicit. While his whispery pillow talk makes Deftones stand out among their mainstream rock peers, which remain oddly neutered or disturbingly macho, <i>P</i><i>alms </i>proves context is key for him on multiple levels. Even the most ardent Deftones fans will admit Moreno’s only got one move in this mode, and that’s to basically rewrite <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPpDyIJdasg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Change (in the House Of Flies)”</a>, floating a couple of longing, breathy notes that can sound like they’re being filtered through a random pitch generator. His melodies are typically impossible to hum along with, but they're extremely effective while juxtaposed with gnarled riffs, serving as a setup for a knee-buckling chorus, or as a leadup to using his preferred vocal EQ'ing that sounds like phone sex over a walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>These moments of catharsis or even contrast never arrive, and less than halfway through, <i>Palms </i>is so entrenched in a specific mood that the songs themselves become interchangeable. Whether out of mutual respect or just a stubborn adherence to a preordained ideal, no one involved does much to push each other; when Moreno allows himself a scream on “Mission Sunset"", it feels overly cautious-- his backing band doesn’t follow suit. This isn’t meant to foster some debate about the superiority of Deftones over Isis, though the former is far more suited to enhancing Moreno’s strengths. The unfortunate truth is that <i>Palms </i>isolates and expands upon some of the least interesting attributes of its creators.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Palms</i> is an admirable effort that’s entirely within Moreno’s M.O.: his first major side gig was the trip-hop inspired <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4379-team-sleep/"">Team Sleep</a> and while his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43411-deftones-dude-has-a-witch-house-project/"">Crosses witch-house project</a> was widely mocked, that’s more the fault of witch house than Moreno. Add in the sneaky <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnI_QIXU058"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cocteau Twins homages</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU4ElIEbeqE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cure covers</a>, and it’s clear Moreno is very earnest about being taken seriously as a connoisseur of “pretty” music. But the anodyne idea of beauty established on <i>Palms</i> can’t help but sound tame and limited in light of how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30338-pinkish-black"">Pinkish Black</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23037-blut-aus-nord"">Blut aus Nord</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven"">Deafheaven</a> or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur R<span>ó</span>s</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18191-sigur-ros-kveikur""><i>Kveikur </i></a>are establishing ways for metal to double as makeout music without skimping on the heavy petting.</p></div>"|18260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18260-palms-palms/|6.5|Ian Cohen

More than a year ago, Relapse Records announced they'd signed the Chicago-and-Baltimore trio. The move seemed surprising at the time, but not because Locrian’s electronics-and-effects-driven approach was at odds with the more orthodox heavy metal roster at Relapse; in fact, the label’s two decades are dotted by momentous dalliances with experimental music. Instead, before signing to Relapse, Locrian released <i>a lot </i>of music, a strategy that worked for a band putting out very limited editions on rather small labels but maybe not one meant for a fringe act now signed to an imprint as large as Relapse. Just how many Locrian eight-tracks or singles could and would Relapse actually handle?</p>
<p>Since the deal, though, Locrian have only issued three titles-- a re-release of one such short-run record bundled with new material, a glacial collaboration with kindred lurkers Mammifer, and a beautiful piece with German sound art veteran Christopher Heemann. After many consecutive years of several albums, splits, and singles each, Locrian went almost silent-- just not behind the scenes. All along, they were sketching, building, and refining <i>Return to Annihilation</i>, their proper Relapse debut and step into a much bigger spotlight. It's an auspicious new phase of their existence: <i>Return to Annihilation </i>is the most provocative and engaging Locrian album to date, a brilliant mystery that evades simplistic definitions by turning their historical din and destruction in on itself and, sometimes, back again.</p>
<p>In initial interviews for <i>Return to Annihilation</i>, Locrian-- multi-instrumentalist André Foisy, vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Terrence Hannum and drummer Steven Hess-- spoke about the influence of Genesis on their new work. It felt to some like trolling, as there was no way the intricate (and sometimes awkward) prog rock of Genesis might have a substantive pull on music so ostensibly moonless and monolithic. But <i>Return to Annihilation</i> is intrinsically elusive, with twists so compelling and layers so deep that each listen reveals a half-dozen new facets. The title track, for instance, is a three-part suite. Locrian begins with the primal, repetitive wallop of Swans, repurposed with industrial accessories. Despite the aggressive delivery, it feels tunefully poppy, beckoning the listener forward just before the song shifts into a cataclysmic drone. Smothering electronics battle with piercing guitars, shaping a stalemate of willpowers. Hess’ drums goad the band forward again, hitting a climax that’s dense but buoyant, like the phosphorescent coda of a melodramatic post-millenial black metal epic. Though this is a triptych of distinct sections, the parts are strangely cohesive, blending into one another as a balance of extremes.</p>
<p>For 50 minutes, <i>Return to Annihilation</i> runs like a whirlwind journey that you must mentally revisit when it’s done playing. Indeed, during the last three months, I’ve listened to this record a few dozen times, and each trip through only seems to solicit more questions about the material itself-- about its balance between corroded metal and coruscated drone, about its strange sense of enveloping atmosphere and unstoppable propulsion, about the completed puzzle and its complex constituent pieces. Sometimes its 15-minute closer, “Obsolete Elegies”, feels like an exhalation of relief, with muted piano and long-tone violin suggesting Pelt plundering the workshop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15831-la-monte-young/"" target=""_blank"">La Monte Young</a>; other times, the quaking electronics and plodding guitar of the same piece intimate a hangman’s anthem, a steady gaze directed over and over again toward another imminent death.    </p>
<p>What’s most rewarding about <i>Return to Annihilation</i> is this sense of narrative and emotional limbo, or the feeling that supposedly staunch binaries-- birth and death, beauty and brutality, triumph and defeat-- function <i>exclusively</i> in interrelated arcs. Sure, there are entire tracks here that feel more nihilistic or uplifting than others. The neon guitars and escalating drum patterns of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15423-eternal-return/"" target=""_blank"">“Eternal Return”</a> are exultant enough to soundtrack an action movie’s climax, while “Exiting the Hall of Vapor and Light” fashions a great, gray canvas from static and distortion, a diorama of nothingness. But in every instance, defeat and relief seem only to be dissolving through one another, not pushing one another from the frame. The guitars in “Vapor and Light” slink into patterns that don’t resolve, but for an instant, they bubble into the sort of ebullient loop that you might hear on a Dustin Wong record; it’s like glimpsing light at the end of a tunnel that’s so big you didn’t even know you were surrounded. And “Eternal Return” takes shape around bitterly shouted imprecations and swells of background noise so strong they sometimes threaten to push the ascension off track. <i>Return to Annihilation </i>forever demands that you decide for yourself-- or, of course, don’t.</p>
<p>In the past, Locrian albums have seemed to me almost uniformly doomed, with their lyrics about industrial decay and blizzards of irascible tones creating an atmosphere of general oppression. But <i>Return to Annihilation </i>implicitly urged me to revisit those earlier records and to listen for, if not foreshadowing, signs that there’d been more ambiguity and complexity at work than I’d first supposed. And there is: The great <i>Drenched Lands</i> seems more forgiving than I’d perceievd, as if its excoriation of society is more of a way out than a mere self-excommunication. Moments of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15997-the-clearing/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Clearing</i></a>, particularly the electrostatically foreboding “Coprolite”, sound in retrospect as if they are trying to climb out of the dark, even if they don’t succeed. <i>Return to Annihilation</i>, then, feels like a perfect nexus of Locrian’s past and future. This is the rare album that reveals new depth within a catalog that already seemed so deep and ruminative while proclaiming rather unlimited possibilities for a band nearing the end of its first decade. It’s a beginning refashioned from expired endings-- as it turns out, an essential Locrian idea.</p></div>"|18255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18255-return-to-annihilation/|8.0|Grayson Haver Currin

He had to give up his last moniker, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29966-run-dmt/"">Run DMT</a>, to a dubstep crew of the same name, so now he's trying Salvia Plath on for size. The music is suited to a new name-- Collins has shed some of the chillwave tendencies that made Run DMT sink into a gauze-y morass of bands around the time of his <i>Bong Voyage</i> in 2009. Instead, he's chosen to bring his 60s psych influences into sharper focus, making everything just a little leaner, although low production values and sloppy playing are still key tenets of his sound. Underneath it all is a sharpening of Collins' songwriting skills, not quite turning <i>The Bardo Story</i> into the parent-friendly record he hoped for in a recent <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/salvia-plath-has-a-nice-trip/#_"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, but certainly lending a feeling that he's getting somewhere, one bong hit at a time.</p>
<p>Something that's immediately apparent from listening to this album is how well versed Collins is in 60s pop, both of the psychedelic variety and beyond. Initially it's hard to hear certain songs as anything other than pastiche, as so often happens when someone is deeply immersed in a particular era. Collins is the kind of guy who probably thinks that Lenny Kaye didn't dig hard enough when researching the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuggets:_Original_Artyfacts_from_the_First_Psychedelic_Era,_1965%E2%80%931968"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Nuggets</i></a> compilations. But, to be fair, he's not adverse to rooting around in the mainstream, finding plenty of room for inspiration in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"">John Lennon</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a> songs, pinching a sigh or two from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">the Beach Boys</a>, even heading into the 70s to steal a few tricks from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15999-randy-newman/"">Randy Newman</a>. He does it so well that it's hard not to be swayed in his direction, taking an approach reminiscent of another Newman acolyte, Chicago musician Liam Hayes (aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3342-plush/"">Plush</a>), whose songwriting is so strong that he transcends the music he's so transparently sourcing.</p>
<p>Of course there are flaws, too. <i>The Bardo Story</i> is a messy album, riddled with a looseness that's either there on purpose or happens to be the consequence of Collins' admittedly limited skills. When he gets it to work, on the sunny foot-stomper ""This American Life"", for example, it's extremely endearing, coming off as the work of someone with a vision far beyond the audience this record is likely to attract. Collins might not be aspirational in that way, but there's a sense here that the grainy production values are becoming a hindrance rather than a valuable part of the picture, especially as he appears to have put a great deal of thought into the overall sound he's trying to express. He covers a decent swathe of ground, but the transitions are rarely jarring, even when he passes the baton from the swirling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30619-the-olivia-tremor-control/"">Olivia Tremor Control</a> moves of ""House of Leaves"" to the spaghetti western whistle of ""Stranded"".</p>
<p>""Bardo"" is a Tibetan word meaning ""intermediate state,"" which provides a less-than subtle nudge toward the idea that this is a transitory album for Collins. It's a new name, a refinement of his vision. The great leaps it takes sometimes feel less like an aesthetic choice and more like the work of someone figuring out where they want to go. It's a cut above most public attempts to undertake such a journey, if indeed that's what Collins is doing. In among it all is a superior songwriter trying not to be wrestled out of the frame by all the limitations imposed upon him, including some spectacularly awful sub-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_dali"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dali</a> cover art. But even that's fitting in its way, a low rent imitation of Surrealism housing a collection of scuzzy sub-psych songs, all of which probably sounded like a great idea when conceptualized through a billow of weed smoke. Fortunately, it still sounds pretty good when the fog clears.</p></div>"|18269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18269-salvia-plath-the-bardo-story/|6.4|Nick Neyland

John Darnielle wrote most of the lyrics in the margins of the stapled, mimeographed handouts given to him in the orientation sessions at his new health-care job in Ames, Iowa. It was 1999. Every day he’d come home at three to an empty house, dishes crowding the sink (his wife was away at hockey camp) and pass the solitary evenings leafing through his handouts and editing the day’s work. When a melody came to him, he’d grab his guitar, mute the TV and hit the red button on a dying, decade-old boombox that had documented hundreds of similarly fractured, bleating folk songs since he began recording as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2845-the-mountain-goats/"" target=""_blank"">the Mountain Goats </a>in 1991.</p>
<p>There were obstacles to recording this way-- sometimes the tape ran out mid-song, very occasionally the phone rang-- and once they were resolved, the composition in question had sometimes already fallen out of Darnielle’s favor. “In those days, a song got exactly one day in which to either resolve its issues or be cast forth from the company of its brethren,” he writes in the reissue’s liner notes. The lucky survivors, though, have a palpable immediacy. Most of the takes you hear on <i>All Hail West Texas </i>were recorded within hours (or, when the juices were really flowing, minutes) of being written.</p>
<p>There’s a common misconception that all Mountain Goats records were recorded this way, but that’s not exactly true. Up until <i>All Hail West Texas</i>’s release in 2002, they were more like compilations-- collage-like assortments of bedroom recordings, live shows, occasional duets, radio broadcasts and four-tracked one-offs. The subject matter was sometimes bleak (especially the many songs that charted in stinging detail the doomed relationship of the fictional Alpha couple) but these variedly textured means of recording lent the albums a feeling of motion: Darnielle seemed more like an eccentric, town-to-town troubadour than an elusive bedroom-folk hermit. But not so on <i>All Hail West Texas</i>. Recording in suburban solitary confinement and exclusively on the boombox gives <i>All Hail</i> <i>West Texas</i> a cohesion and an echoing sense of isolation-- the perfect atmosphere for 14 songs about crushed dreams (“The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton”), long-distance longing (“Source Decay”), and occasional moments of piercing joy (“Jenny”).</p>
<p>While recording <i>All Hail</i>, Darnielle did have a companion of sorts: his Panasonic RX-FT500, a temperamental machine so crucial to the album’s overall vibe that he credits it as a “second performer” in the liner notes. It had been out of commission for about two years (listening to the RX-FT500’s contributions to the Mountain Goats’ discography chronologically is kind of like listening to an alt-folk <i>Disintegration Loops</i>: you can practically chart its slow, gradual decay), but that fateful summer, it came back from the brink of death for an encore performance. “What you have with you now,” Darnielle writes on the inside sleeve, “[Is] the sound of a long-broken machine deciding, on its own and without the interference of repairmen or excessive prayer vigils, to function again.” And perhaps more than any other Mountain Goats record, you get a sense of this feeling in his voice, too: urgency, finality, and a twinge of superstition-- as though he’s not sure the “record” button will still be working by the next take.</p>
<p>The first people we meet are Jeff and Cyrus, a pair of pentagram-doodling teenage metalheads with big dreams for their still-unnamed two-man band (though they’ve been arguing over a few possibilities: Satan’s Fingers, the Killers, the Hospital Bombers). They’re the stars of album opener “The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton” a song that, if not <i>the</i> definitive Mountain Goats song, at least deserves an undisputed mention in the top 5. This isn’t a statement you throw around lightly about a band this prolific, but “Denton” feels like a dizzyingly succinct crash course in everything that makes the Mountain Goats great. In just two-and-a-half minutes, Darnielle pulls off three whiplashing tonal shifts. It starts off seeming like a light, funny song about a couple of high school goofballs, but then-- with a simple, unexpected pivot in the chord progression—things turn suddenly poignant: the band and the boys’ friendship is abruptly interrupted when Cyrus gets sent to a boarding school-- or, as the now-ominous “Hospital Bombers” suggests, could it be a psychiatric facility?-- “where they told him he’d never be famous.” In its closing moments, though, it becomes defiant, triumphant battlecry: “When you punish a person for dreaming his dream/ Don’t expect him to thank or forgive you/ The best ever death metal band out of Denton/ Will in time both outpace and outlive you.” It’s brilliantly structured and smartly crafted, but it wouldn’t be half as stirring if it were recorded with more polish. “Denton” is an imperfectly sung ode to all the songs that don’t get sung because of the people who put into the singers’ heads that the only songs worth singing are the perfect ones.</p>
<p>As advertised on its otherwise blank cover, <i>All Hail West Texas</i> is comprised of “fourteen songs about seven people, two houses, a motorcycle, and a locked treatment facility for adolescent boys.” The specificity of the narrative here is something of a joke: this was Darnielle’s first attempt at a concept album and-- somewhat paradoxically-- it succeeds mostly because of how loose the concept is. None of the other recurring characters get the first-name introductions that Jeff and Cyrus do, and it’s hard to follow which songs are about which of the seven people, or where one person ends and the other begins.</p>
<p>But that’s the point-- and even the brilliance-- of <i>All Hail West Texas</i>. Darnielle finds the common humanity in the people he’s singing about, whether it’s the injured high school football star who accidentally sells acid to an undercover cop (“Fall of the High School Running Back”), the blissfully happy couple in “Jenny” or the thoroughly miserable one in “Fault Lines”. There’s no shortage of contenders for “most devastating moment on <i>All Hail West Texas</i>”, but my vote goes to the half-second beat between tracks 8 and 9, the tender “Riches and Wonders” (“We are strong, we are faithful, we are guardians of a rare thing…/ And we dance like drunken sailors, lost at sea, out of our minds”) and the searing pre-break-up travelogue “The Mess Inside” (“We went down to New Orleans one weekend in the spring/ Looked hard for what we’d lost/ It was painful to admit it, but we couldn’t find a thing”). Are these two songs about the same couple? The suggestion that they <i>could</i> be-- that the potent feeling captured in “Riches” is too often something fleeting-- stings worse than knowing for sure.</p>
<p>As the Panasonic RX-FT500’s swansong, <i>All Hail West Texas</i> (which finally came out, first on cassette, in 2002) does mark the end of something fleeting, too. Later in 2002, Darnielle released the excellent <i>Tallahassee</i>-- not only the first “hi-fi” Mountain Goats record, but also the first in a series of concept albums that stick to much clearer narratives. But in the retrospective ruminations prompted by Merge’s new CD/LP reissue of this album, it feels less like a turning point in Darnielle’s career than an undeniable sweet spot. Mountain Goats fans are generally divided between the lo-fi diehards who champion the unpolished virtues of the early stuff and the people who prefer the more finely crafted later records. But <i>All Hail West Texas</i> (as well as the highlights of the previously unreleased material included with the reissue, like “Answering the Phone” and the proto-<i>Tallahassee</i> sketch “Indonesia”) is the best of both worlds: a snapshot of the moment when Darnielle had honed his lyrical and melodic sensibilities well enough to write songs as good as “Jenny” and “The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton”, but also perhaps before he actually realized how good and enduring these songs actually were.</p>
<p>Revisiting <i>All Hail West Texas</i> over two decades into the Mountain Goats’ existence makes a central irony in their story all too clear: it’s not a lonely record anymore. A handful of these songs remain the most iconic in the Mountain Goats catalog, which-- thanks to Darnielle’s cult fanbase that seems to be steadily, improbably increasing with each year-- means that some of the lines that echoed off the empty walls that summer in Ames, Iowa have now been screamed by thousands and thousands of different people. When Darnielle put most of these songs to tape in 1999, even to his fans he seemed like someone who’d end up a committed but obscure lifer on the indie cassette circuit; it was hard to imagine there’d ever be a wide audience for the kind of eccentric, homespun music he was making. But remember: people underestimated Jeff and Cyrus, too.</p></div>"|18288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18288-the-mountain-goats-all-hail-west-texas/|9.0|Lindsay Zoladz

(Or, rather, its companion, including some songs they started at the earlier sessions). It'se even more of a surprise that <i>Electric</i> is their most immediate, jubilant record in at least a decade-- a return to a couple of elements of their work that had been lying fallow for too long.</p>
<p>Most notably, this is the first time in a while that Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have borrowed from what's going on in dance clubs in the service of pop songwriting, with help from veteran producer Stuart Price. (""Shouting in the Evening"" even nods to dubstep.) <i>Electric</i> isn't quite electrifying in the way that <i>Very</i> and <i>Introspective</i> and ""What Have I Done To Deserve This?"" are, but nearly every track has a moment or two that ignites seemingly long-gone enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Sometimes, that's because the Boys are using specific tricks that have worked for them before. ""Love Is a Bourgeois Construct"" is another in their string of modified classical pieces, taking its countermelody from Henry Purcell's <i>King Arthur</i> (by way of Michael Nyman's ""Chasing Sheep Is Best Left to Shepherds""), and its sour-grapes premise from a line in a David Lodge novel. And ""Thursday"" might have recalled 1986's ""Love Comes Quickly"" even without a synth-bass-and-bells introduction that makes it sound like that song's fraternal twin.</p>
<p>The one thing Tennant and Lowe arguably do better than anyone else, though, is queering pop-- finding ways to recast seemingly sexuality-neutral musical ideas as specifically gay. ""Bolshy""-- slang for ""uncooperative"" or ""belligerent,"" roughly-- isn't ordinarily a gendered word, but it sure is in the song by that name here, and its connotation of Bolsheviks fits in with the Pet Shop Boys' fascination with all things early-Soviet. <i>Electric</i>'s sole cover is a brilliant recontextualization: ""The Last to Die"" is a 2007 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"" target=""_blank"">Bruce Springsteen</a> song, whose chorus quotes John Kerry's 1971 condemnation of the Vietnam war. Tennant and Lowe scarcely change a word of its lyrics, but arranged and sung as a Pet Shop Boys song, it abruptly and unmistakably becomes a song about gay culture's transition from the AIDS crisis of the ""West End Girls"" era to its current focus on domesticity. That's quite a feat.</p>
<p>In place of the leavetakings of their past few albums' final tracks, <i>Electric</i> ends with ""Vocal"", a fantasy of hearing exactly the kind of music you've always wanted to hear, in the perfect club. ""I like the singer/ He's lonely and strange/ Every track has a vocal,"" Tennant muses in his lonely, strange voice. It's a bit unusual to hear so many vocal tracks in a club these days, he knows, but he's imagining that his songs could save some kid the way other people's songs once saved him.</p></div>"|18268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18268-pet-shop-boys-electric/|7.0|Douglas Wolk

Their songs have a simplicity to them that makes it easy to imagine dozens of tracks being churned out in tape after tape. But what does it mean to be a band whose goals seem so relaxed and simple? What rubric do you use to evaluate a band who once boasted, “When she’s takin’ off my pants, I know what to do”?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">You have to meet the Memories on their own turf. They made that task easy last year on their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16880-the-memories/"">self-titled album</a>, which had a interesting production and a strange sort of charm. Those songs weren’t elaborate or eloquent, but what “Baby (You’re Totally Crazy)” lacked in complex sentiments, it compensated with lush instrumentation. When they made overt references to smoking pot, like on “Higher” and “Took Drugs (Went Insane)”, they complemented them with an appropriately mellow and ethereal atmosphere. In the aforementioned “I Know What to Do”, there’s a Southern rock guitar solo that's warm, simple and just clicks everything into place. This stuff is meant to be uncomplicated and breezy-- AM radio gold for the slacker set. But <i>Love Is the Law</i>, which doesn't always stick to the beatific production of <i>The Memories</i>, proves that there’s a razor-thin line between sweetly simple and facepalmingly dumb.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Love Is the Law </i>is 17 tracks long, most of which are shorter than two minutes. With this onslaught of ideas in rapid succession, it quickly reveals itself as a mixed bag. It's probably best to approach these songs with this formula in mind: Find the ratio of catchiness to cringeworthiness. Though the lyrics of ""En Espanol"" are rudimentary, the hook is catchy enough to latch onto and enjoy. If you're ready for a short ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>"" goof, they've offered up the digestibly ridiculous ballad ""Like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Riker"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Riker</a>"" (which they rhyme with ""I like her"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like any ""Tim and Eric"" sketch, your reaction to this album will heavily depend on what you find funny. One of the most polarizing examples of this is ""You Need a Big Man"", which not only features lyrics that boast about having a large penis (""a big man tough and a big man strong/ you need a big man thick and a big man long""), but also a series of air guitar riffs sung in a weirdo twang. Obviously, this track's goal is to earn some laughs, and if this is something you can find a way to laugh at after you've heard it one time, then the song's catchiness will probably win you over. But I cannot imagine a similar fate befalling ""Go Down on You"", another admittedly catchy minute-long ditty with the inexcusable line ""I'd like a taste between your waist/ A sweet surprise between your thighs"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But then just as easily, they can call back to what made <i>The Memories</i> an enjoyable record in the first place. ""Love Is Not a Dream"", ""I Remember You"", and ""Wasted All the Time"" pack some pleasant jangling atmosphere in for tracks that evoke the kind of warmth this album often strives for. Ultimately, though, it's hard actively want to listen to most of these songs. They're bite-sized enough that they should be like candy-- fun, sugary, easy, quick. Instead, there are several tracks here that make <i>Love Is the L</i><i>aw</i> feel like a chore.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/burgerrecords/the-memories-en-espanol"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">press release</a> for this album boasted that these tracks came from the band's memories, which means these musings on penis size, Riker, and cunnilingus are their sing-songy memoirs. It's the skeezy stoner version of using nostalgia as a lyrical hook. “We want people to hear these songs and remember their exes. We want people to remember things and smile. To remember and to savor the flavor,"" said Gage. And this is clearly something they intended for people to experience via a tape deck, preferably while stoned. So there's something about the Memories' <i>Love Is the Law </i>mission statement that doesn't fully add up. They're targeting an audience of people who stereotypically listen to music that offers escapism of some kind, whether it's through psych, prog, reggae, hip-hop, ambient, or yes, Burger Records. And while these songs can occasionally find that perfect balance of catchiness, sweetly familiar sentiments, and home-recorded charm, there a few too many lemons for this to be a record worthy of vibing out.</p></div>"|18258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18258-the-memories-love-is-the-law/|5.8|Evan Minsker

This sound-- big waves of guitar bearing a small voice gently upward-- works a useful salve for loneliness, but it also sounds majestic ringing out over an open field at an outdoor festival; at its best, it feels timeless. <i>Destruction in Yr Soul</i>, the band's third full-length, aims higher and resonates more deeply than 2011's <i>Lonely Twin</i>: Supplied with rich, cavernous production, Ships bandleader Jordan Geiger manages to stir some of the grand feelings of his idols.</p>
<p>These eight songs have simple, hulking structures, rising tall and plain like grain silos. Opener ""Come Back to Life"" is fitted with a frame of two chords, a pounding bass drum, two bass notes, and not much else, all of them spaced miles apart. Into this empty space, Geiger pours keening guitar leads, billowing blasts of feedback, hammered piano octaves, and his frail voice, whispering a love song pricked by spiritual intimations: Lazarus, the shadow of death. The song has a hymnal, familiar feel-- ""Raise up my voice/ Into the night,"" Geiger sings at the outset.</p>
<p>He wants these songs to feel like songs you've known your whole life, and when <i>Destruction</i> is really good, he manages to make you feel this way even when you can hear his inspirations coursing right beneath the surface. ""If It Speaks"" has a direct ""Neighborhood No. 1"" quote hidden right in its pulse, but Geiger doesn't let the echo of this larger song obscure his; he builds an anthem of his own right on top of it, making for maybe his best-ever song. ""I'm not strong, and I'm not proud/ But if it's strong, we can pull it down"", Geiger sings, upon which an enormous-sounding guitar cruises overhead like a UFO darkening the song's big Midwestern sky. </p>
<p>Geiger opens ""If It Speaks"" by observing ""I am not/ The son of god/ And I am not the only one,"" and sometimes Hospital Ships resemble like a Christian rock band minus the overt dogma: He invites us to ""Let the dying world die, yeah just let it go"" on ""Joan of Arc"", and on ""Lost Folk Song"", he tells us ""I prayed my seed don't take no purchase in this land."" Geiger's lyrics read like slogans plucked and arranged for maximum anthem potential more than like couplets or stories, but notes of redemption, destiny, and worldly transcendence pop up repeatedly. ""My cell phone won't stop ringing/ And the angels all are singing,"" he sings on ""Desolation Waltz"", chiding us gently that ""all your gold won't save your life"" on ""All Yr Gold"". </p>
<p>The album's reverent tone, by the end, induces minor grandeur fatigue of the sort that <i>Man of Steel</i> viewers reported during the film's third hour. There aren't quite enough grace notes in Geiger's lyrics or songwriting yet to make you care deeply about this band. Who knows, though: Geiger made a quantum leap from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15517-lonely-twin/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lonely Twin</i></a> to this album. <i>Destruction In Yr Soul</i> isn't strikingly original, but it is heartfelt and comforting, and there is plenty of starlit sky here to stretch out beneath for those in search of it.</p></div>"|18174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18174-hospital-ships-destruction-in-yr-soul/|6.6|Jayson Greene

Smith</a>, it was only in the 1990s that German rock band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"" target=""_blank"">Can</a> assumed its rightful place in the canon alongside the likes of the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Velvet Underground. One might even contend that Can’s emphasis on collaging and editing their improvised music (courtesy of bassist/producer Holger Czukay), all of it tethered to drummer Jaki Liebezeit’s relentless rhythms, exert far more influence on 21<sup>st</sup> century music than any of the aforementioned acts. Iconic bands such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"" target=""_blank"">Tortoise</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a> remain deeply in their debt; same goes for massively influential producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"" target=""_blank"">Carl Craig</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>, and François Kevorkian (all of whom remixed Can’s music on the 1997 compilation, <i>Sacrilege</i>).</p>
<p>Even after the band dissolved, vital music continued to issue forth from its members: Holger Czukay’s solo albums from the 80s are well-worth investigating (as is the dark murmuring album he made with punk band <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/SYPH-SYPH/release/887484%5D"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">S.Y.P.H.</a>), as is the music Liebezeit helmed in the Phantom Band and as part of Dunkelziffer, a curious Can offshoot.</p>
<p>Some nineteen different players are credited on <i>Retrospection</i>, the first overview of the Köln-based collective that arose in the wake of Can’s demise. In addition to the core group of Dominik Von Senger, Matthias Keul, Olek Gelba, Reiner Linke, and Stefan Krachten, it also featured late-era Can members like Rebop Kwaku Baahchaz and Rosko Gee (both of whom were also members of Traffic), as well as contributions from Liebezeit and Damo Suzuki. Available both digitally and as a 3-LP set, <i>Retrospection</i> cherrypicks from the group’s 80’s output, a four album run starting with 1983’s <i>Colours and Soul</i> and ending with 1989’s <i>Songs for Everyone</i>.</p>
<p>First song “This is How You Came” features tropical sound effects, some baby talk, and a lush polyrhythmic groove with extra hand percussion, while the next song, “Q” detours into the strangely lush world of Ryiuchi Sakamoto-styled gloss and early 80s sax, a strain of smooth jazz made all the stranger by Suzuki’s brand of pillow talk. On the 13-minute sprawl of “Retrospection"", the groove is decidedly more AOR rock-based, with Suzuki’s deeper vocals grappling with Wolfgang Schubert’s saxophone. If you ever wondered what it might sound like if the horn from <a href=""http://youtu.be/81H2TYkXZwY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Baker Street”</a> wandered onto <i>Ege Bamyasi</i>, here is the closest approximation of that trainwreck.</p>
<p>But as odd a fit as such rock moves can sound, it’s when grotesque-seeming genres like “Teutonic reggae” and “Kosmische-fusion” appear that the set intrigues. “Keine Python” has the skip and bounce of turn-of-decade reggae (think of Sly &amp; Robbie’s Taxi productions) with vocalist Coco Claus yipping like Ari Up as Berliner. “Network” finds the group mimic Weather Report via Schubert’s processed horn and Krachten’s shuffling drum patterns while Suzuki scats amid the slick fusion.</p>
<p>The highlight of the vinyl set for me occurs on the second 12”. It opens with “Trailer II"", coupling a martial beat of “Sunday Bloody Sunday” with a bass throb like something emanating from <i>Metal Box</i>. With Suzuki’s inexplicable muttering on top, it makes for a sinuous and intoxicating dark disco track. The taut and vivacious “Bleib Nicht So Lang Im Schatten Stehn” shows that Dunkelziffer could also make boisterous femme-fronted new wave with Claus, too. Uneven at times, its sleekness sometimes to the point of sounding oily, <i>Retrospection</i> will still reward and satisfy Can fans, showing how their DNA continued to mutate the music of their homeland even after they had disbanded.</p></div>"|18131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18131-dunkelziffer-retrospection-part-1-2-3/|6.8|Andy Beta

In interviews, they come off as eager, curious, and transparent about their process and their gear, but their music is about as approachable as an Egyptian tomb. On <i>Slow Focus</i>, their first album in four years, Fuck Buttons remain devoted to forbidding, elemental sensations, and their slow-moving pieces inspire the kinds of big feelings-- exhilaration, majesty, awe-- that double as reminders of our smallness. </p>
<p>Listening to their progression, from 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11280-street-horrrsing/"" target=""_blank""><i>Street Horrrsing</i></a> to now, you get the sense of tinkerers building obsessively retooled versions of the monolith from <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, each bigger than the last. (We are the apes in this equation.) They got their start in the noise-rock community, but transcended that niche almost immediately, and their earliest material, some of featuring distorted, screaming vocals, sounds positively quaint in light of what followed.<i> Tarot Sport</i> was so much larger and more ambitious than their debut that it gave them an unlikely career as festival headliners, and a piece of the album (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11528-surf-solar-7-edit/"" target=""_blank"">""Surf Solar""</a>) snuck its way into Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympics. <i>Slow Focus</i> feels like a logical endpoint to their journey: <i>Tarot Sport</i> might have gotten them to the Olympics, but they've never sounded this, well, Olympian before.</p>
<p>The difference is apparent from the opening seconds of the nine-minute ""Brainfreeze."" The massive sounds we hear-- a warped synth figure being pounded into shapes by hammering drums and a pistoning rhythm track-- are lonelier and more remote than anything Fuck Buttons have made before. <i>Tarot Sport</i>, big as it was, gestured vaguely at human bodies, with airy, glittering sounds on ""Surf Solar"" evoking an outdoor festival or a rave. There are no human bodies left on <i>Slow Focus</i>, just open space and hard surfaces, and the sounds resound for miles in all directions.</p>
<p>Power and Hung self-produced the record, and judging from the results, they should start producing for other acts as well. Every sound on <i>Slow Focus</i> is smooth, polished, and lovingly molded, like a factory-shaped piece of steel. The album's tone is a curious mix of juiced and muted, like Hung and Power have rewired the maximalism of stadium EDM to arrive at the minimalist emptiness of someone like Detroit's Robert Hood. This is perfectionist's music: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Dre</a>, who has been holed up for years vacuuming pathogens off of <i>Detox</i> like dead skin cells from a computer keyboard, might be chasing a sound like this-- deep and resonant and beautifully emptied-out.</p>
<p>The seven tracks tend to move in simple, navigational arcs: Open widescreen on an empty vista, pull back even further. Midway through ""Brainfreeze"", the synths shift up an octave and widen outward until they slowly swallow the track, a giant space cruiser blotting out the sky. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15550-fuck-buttons-the-red-wing-edit/"" target=""_blank"">""The Red Wing""</a> begins with percussive pops and adds layers until the percussion all but disappears, a city shrinking to pinprick in a shuttle window. This journey might grow wearying if the textures on the album weren't so fascinating and dimensional; a piece like ""Stalker"" seems to be operating on six different planes at once, and it's a pleasure just to be able to walk through the space.</p>
<p>The song titles -- ""Sentients"", ""The Red Wing"", ""Hidden XS""-- are unusually instructive for Fuck Buttons, who normally make a point of avoiding specific cues for their music. But <i>Slow Focus</i> plays like a utopian nightmare of mechanization-- on ""Year of the Dog,"" György Ligeti strings screech beneath a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"" target=""_blank"">Giorgio Moroder</a> synth, while the first sound on the ten-minute ""Stalker"" is a bland, lasering synth, like a printer whirring away at a thousand-page document. <i>Slow Focus</i> is pointedly pitiless, inexorable: There are no human feelings here, at least of the squishy kind. If you are fascinated by the people around you the same way you are fascinated by protozoa, you might identify uncomfortably with the world <i>Slow Focus</i> depicts. When at the next TED Conference, a clicker-brandishing, headset-wearing speaker argues that harvesting organs from the rest of the human population is the logical way to progress, ""Stalker"" will probably be playing on the slideshow. </p>
<p>There has always been menace in Fuck Buttons' music, but it used to exist in balance with lighter, leavening moments, like ""Bright Tomorrow"" or ""The Lisbon Maru"". With the exception of the manic, squeegeeing synths that dance through ""Prince's Prize"", that touch is absent on <i>Slow Focus</i>. It's missed, slightly, but a little humor would have punctured the purity of the world they've built. Power and Hung have made either the year's most introverted party album or the most expansive loner's album; either way, there are few albums this year that offer this much space to get lost in.</p></div>"|18295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18295-fuck-buttons-slow-focus/|8.7|Jayson Greene

But, listening to his early Rephlex-released LPs under the µ-Ziq alias, his importance in shaping the style is indisputable. From there his career path has been far from straightforward: by the late 90s he'd made a lateral move, setting up his own label and arguably proving himself a better A&amp;R than he was a producer. Planet Mu presided over several major developments in global electronic music, from millennial breakcore to mid-noughties dubstep and, more recently, footwork.</p>
<p>Paradinas’ own production, meanwhile, seemed to falter during the 2000s. 2003’s <i>Bilious Paths</i> was an enjoyable exploration of the sound-and-fury of drill and bass and breakcore, if a little beholden to label successes like Venetian Snares. 2007’s <i>Duntisbourne Abbots Soulmate Devastation Technique</i>, meanwhile, followed the break-up of a long-term relationship, and its suffocatingly maudlin spin on Paradinas’ usual melodic style proved rather difficult to love. Since then we’ve heard little from Paradinas the producer, but 2013 has marked a surprising return to form. First there was Heterotic’s <i>Love &amp; Devotion</i>, an album of euphoric, romantic synth-pop produced in collaboration with Paradinas’ new wife, Lara Rix-Martin. Following that was a µ-Ziq EP, <i>XTEP</i>, which showcased a newly airy sound, contiguous with his past work but also displaying the influence of chillwave, italo disco, piano house, and plenty else besides.</p>
<p class=""p2"">As with both of these records, <i>Chewed Corners</i>, the first µ-Ziq LP in six years, has a certain giddiness to it-- a giddiness, it’s tempting to conclude, born of new love and fresh optimism. Of course, that optimism could be less to do with Paradinas’ personal life than with the state of music: much of this record displays the influence of recent Planet Mu signings, or of broader trends in contemporary electronic music. ""Taikon"" and ""Twangle Melkas"" draw on Kuedo’s Vangelis-via-Southern-hip-hop schtick; ""Tickly Flanks"" owes a debt to the sugar-rush hardcore-footwork hybrids of Machinedrum, though it’s a little torpid in comparison to its forebear. ""Wipe""'s syncopated rhythms nod to UK funky, while ""Houzz 10"" could be a symptom of the recent house revival-- except Paradinas’ take on the form is particularly dreamy, rolling along on a single blissy break-of-dawn plateau for its duration. </p>
<p class=""p2"">Fortunately, Paradinas just as often succeeds in massaging his inspirations into an idiom entirely his own. There are plenty of highlights here-- heat-warped synth interlude ""Monyth"", the heavy-lidded ""Hug"", ""Mountain Island Boner"", whose portentous piano chords would almost be laughable were they not rather affecting. All of them sound fresh, but are also recognisably µ-Ziq-- unlike the occasional borderline-pastiche footwork remix Paradinas has turned out in recent years. Granted, the weaknesses of past µ-Ziq work live on along with its strengths, and Paradinas’ penchant for overwhelmingly dense arrangements occasionally gets the better of him-- particularly in closer ""Weakling Paradinas"", which aims for euphoric texture-overload but overshoots, resulting in a fatiguing mess. But in <i>Chewed Corners</i> Paradinas has put together an LP brimming with fresh ideas-- which, for an artist entering the third decade of his career, is no mean feat. </p></div>"|18207.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18207--ziq-chewed-corners/|7.1|Angus Finlayson

His discography is so vast at this point, with so many notable collaborators picked up along the way, that even the most ardent krautrock obsessive probably doesn't own a complete set of his works. Roedelius is a founding member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8797-harmonia/"">Harmonia</a>, and made a handful of recordings with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27520-cluster-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> in the 1970s. But that's just scratching the surface of his output. To help make sense of it all, the chronology section of Roedelius' <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Joachim_Roedelius"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia page</a> is split into seven eras, split across six decades. The last entry at the time of writing this review is his unlikely <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17767-lloyd-cole-hans-joachim-roedelius-selected-studies-vol-1/"">matchup</a> with English singer-songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/791-lloyd-cole/"">Lloyd Cole</a>. But Roedelius has already moved on from there, returning to <a href=""http://www.bureau-b.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bureau B</a> for this collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4250-to-rococo-rot/"">To Rococo Rot</a>/<a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kreidler"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kreidler</a> musician Stefan Schneider. Even this is likely to be old material now, with barely a speck of dust allowed to settle on Roedelius's console before he's off into the night, working elsewhere.</p>
<p>At least this pairing makes some kind of sense, as it feels like Roedelius is working with someone who has the same inquisitive approach to electronic music as his own. Schneider's not adverse to stretching outside his comfort zone, either; To Rococo Rot are known for going out on a limb on occasion, even remixing fey indie-pop outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3263-the-pastels/"">the Pastels</a>. Still, <i>Tiden</i> isn't a great leap for either musician, with Roedelius providing tasteful classical piano at all the right junctures, and Schneider simply credited with contributing ""Elektronik"". The mood is resolutely introspective, but positively light and breezy throughout. Even when they hit a downward curve there's an element stirred into the mix that lifts the mood. ""Toast"" looks to be circling the hauntology sub-genre at one point, but gets a decent amount of uplift via familiar post-rock elements provided (presumably) by Schneider.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time this pair have collaborated, making it no surprise that there's a comfort to <i>Tiden</i> that replaces the stiffening that sometimes beset Roedelius's work with Cole. At times it's a little too casual, causing certain tracks to form an uneven shape somewhere between bland piano bar noodling and something genuinely pretty-- There's even a track titled ""Mild"". When they don’t follow straight lines, adding discordance to the mix, there's a richness that puts the meandering material in the shade. Those moments come when rhythms don't follow logical patterns, or a darker edge is cut into the electronic shapes. It lends a sense of parity between the men and their machines, a feeling of them relinquishing control and removing some of the tight parameters, just to see where it will take them.</p>
<p>On <i>Tiden</i> it's mostly pretty easy to pull apart tracks and figure out who did what, although there's never a feeling of two figures resting on their laurels. Occasionally it's reminiscent of that moment in the 90s when indie-rock and electronic music got all jumbled up, leading to excellent collaborations such as the contribution <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2846-mouse-on-mars/"">Mouse on Mars</a> made to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>'s <i>Dots and Loops</i>. There's an amusingly titled track called ""Indie Woogie"" that nods to that era, although here a greater sense of sadness prevails. Where <i>Dots and Loops</i> reeked of optimism, on ""Indie Woogie"" there's a feeling of dreams burning down, of promise not being fulfilled. It's atypical of the overall mood, but illustrates a depth away from the soft glow at this album's core. Roedelius's thoughts are probably elsewhere anyway, shifting around ideas, figuring out a new set of altered states to explore next time.</p></div>"|18289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18289-roedelius-schneider-tiden/|6.4|Nick Neyland

The band’s name, written in large white capital letters, stretches across the top of the record’s cover within a thick black bar; below, the album’s name, <i>Rebellion Hymns,</i> squeezes across the bottom, caps-lock again surrounded by black. The disc’s spine even co-opts the familiar Young God Records layout, with Profound Lore’s coat of arms and the album’s catalog number both offset in separate white boxes. Indeed, Michael Gira’s work, particularly as it bled in the late 90s from Swans into Angels of Light, offers a clear stylistic guide for Wunder’s own reflections on morality and morbidity. Like Gira, Wunder’s swollen, resonant bellow lifts lines about desperation, resignation, and perseverance above electrically charged acoustic music-- a bleak mirror image of typecast heaviness.</p>
<p>Such a conspicuous reference to one of music’s great cult acts cuts both ways, of course. It situates <i>Rebellion Hymns</i> within a clear aesthetic framework, but it also sets a particularly heavy onus of expectation squarely at the feet of Man’s Gin. But by and large, Wunder proves to be a compelling songwriter and arranger, overhauling structures in ways that make it clear that Man’s Gin is neither mere obsequy or a vacuous side-project from a musician better-known for his role in Cobalt. Most often, <i>Rebellion Hymns</i> gathers itself into grand waves, with what might sound like folk or country tunes rising deliberately into dramatic crescendos. During album opener “Inspiration”, for instance, Wunder delivers a series of motivational credos (“Take a leaf off a tree and make it worth something”) over a steady rise in volume; by song’s end, he’s yelling his mantras, his voice straining and cracking over accordion, drums, and piano. The terrific <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15440-deer-head-the-rain/"" target=""_blank"">“Deer Head &amp; the Rain”</a> pushes from a similarly polite mien to, four minutes later, a truly Swans-styled meanness, as Wunder shouts over cascading drums and guitars that surge through a thin scrim of dissonance.</p>
<p>Such a songwriting script is a holdover from <i>Smiling Dogs</i>, Wunder’s previous and much more monotonous LP as Man’s Gin. On <i>Rebellion Hymns</i>, for better and worse, he strikes out in several new directions at once, aided again by the versatile backing band of Joshua Lozano and Scott Edward and contributions from a number of guests, including former Swan Jarboe and Cobalt’s other half, Phil McSorley. “Old House (Bark at the Moonwalk)” slyly approximates the shape of black metal with piano, its keys flickering quickly while the drums crack open behind it; a series of rhythmic switchbacks and momentum swings, “Old House” eventually peaks in a full sprint, with Wunder yelling over chaotic guitar and still-pounding piano. “Never Do the Neon Lights” pushes decidedly toward pop-rock, swiveling on a hook that’s perfectly sharp and strangely reassuring. Closer “Hibernation Time” is Wunder’s attempt to construct an acoustic doom epic, with the baritone saxophone of Yakuza’s Bruce Lamont smoldering beneath forlorn vocals and a curtain of neon noise.</p>
<p>These are indeed intriguing moments, but as an hour-long, 12-track album, <i>Rebellion Hymns</i> fails to weave together the various and variably provocative threads that Wunder offers. The band flips from the plaintive acoustic croon of “Varicose” to the awkward gypsy folk growl of “Off The Coast of Sicily”, from the strangely bustling and winning grunge of “Never Do the Neon Lights” to the demented acoustic plod of “Deer Head &amp; the Rain”. The band scatters four instrumental interludes through the disc, too-- three are untitled, though the last and best is a candlelit piano dirge called “Cellar Door”. The scraped piano strings and aleatory percussion of the first and third such pieces and the asphyxiated guitar of the middle number are rather rote lifts of 20th century composition. More important, though, is that none of these wordless bits do anything to enhance the album as an experience or to help the tunes themselves make more sense as neighbors. Rather, they only sit in their places, unarticulated thoughts that never fell quite to the cutting-room floor.   </p>
<p>Wunder’s voice doesn’t do him any favors here, either. He’s a terrific singer, with a deep tone that seems to bubble up from a pool of experience. But he wanders uncomfortably inside of it, alternately taking on the characters of Eddie Vedder, Mike Patton, Scott Kelly, Layne Staley, and, at certain points along the way, himself. Man’s Gin remains, then, the quintessential <i>other</i> band, functioning more as a reservoir for outlying ideas and accessorized themes than an outfit with a direct focus or aim. But even though <i>Rebellion Hymns </i>is less cohesive than <i>Smiling Dogs</i>, that’s because it’s more imaginative, suggesting that Wunder is slowly acclimating to his role as Man’s Gin singer, songwriter and-- most important-- bandleader<i>. </i></p></div>"|18159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18159-mans-gin-rebellion-hymns/|6.1|Grayson Currin

It’s just her and a cello, improvising without overdubs or effects. The production is raw and immediate, putting you so close to her instrument you can practically see the divots in its strings. And the music is so impulsive and untamed that at times it feels like you’re hearing her nervous system. Lee has made intimate solo music before-- 2008’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12106-i-saw-the-ghost-of-an-unknown-soul-and-it-said/"">I Saw the Ghost of an Unknown Soul and It Said…</a> </i>is a highlight of her diverse discography-- but nothing so far has had the direct impact of <i>Ghil</i>.</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that <i>Ghil </i>is actually a collaboration. Lee played all the sounds on the album, but they were recorded by Norwegian noise musician <a href=""http://www.lassemarhaug.no/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lasse Marhaug</a>, whose ideas guided the project. Marhaug took Lee to numerous locations in Oslo and documented her improvisations with a cheap mic and a vintage 1976 tape deck. Lee calls Marhaug’s technique “expressionistic…the way he recorded was the closest way to how I 'feel’ when I play rather than how it 'sounds.’” The pair laid down nearly three hours of music this way, and Lee trusted Marhaug so much that she let him edit and sequence the results without hearing the full source material herself.</p>
<p>That was a wise decision, because Marhaug did a masterful job of choosing and arranging Lee’s music. He maintains the sessions’ in-the-moment feel while crafting a progression that approaches narrative. <i>Ghil </i>is also remarkably varied for an album with such a consistent emotional tone. Though Lee always sounds like she’s playing on the edge of her seat, some of the music is hypnotic, with repetitions that encourage meditation; other sections dart around so quickly it’s like she's putting out fires in the corners of her mind. Tracks like the trebly “Meolly Ganeun” sound like a pedal-pushing noise band, while the cavernous “Hollow Water” and the growling “Two Perfectly Shaped Stones” build drones that seem beyond the capacity of a single instrument.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Lee’s work or improv in general, a good reference point for <i>Ghil </i>might be the saxophone workouts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/"">Colin Stetson</a>. Both he and Lee put physical effort into their music that in turn has a visceral effect on the listener. But where Stetson can drift toward calmer tones, Lee here is all about brute force-- sometimes at a frightening level. Take the ear-busting “Two to Your Right, Five to Your Left,” which evokes string sections from horror movie soundtracks shattered against each other.</p>
<p>That thrill-ride aspect of <i>Ghil </i>is intoxicating, but its main strength is how it sounds both tactile and emotional-- both like natural phenomena and purposeful music. I often find myself fascinated by Lee’s textures and how she created them, but I never feel like I’m listening to field recordings or abstract art. That’s due to Lee’s pedigree as a composer and player-- she has a degree in music from Berklee, has accompanied <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2132-vijay-iyer/"">Vijay Iyer</a>, and made two albums of precisely-arranged music for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/"">John Zorn</a>’s Tzadik label.</p>
<p>But when Marhaug asked her to record, Lee had reached a stage where she was thinking less about structure, preferring to “start totally blank and wait for something to tell me where to go.” The result is an album that somehow embraces music while it’s abandoning it. And whichever end of her spectrum Lee swings toward-- the harshly noisy or the hypnotically meditative-- her sound always commands attention, making <i>Ghil </i>the biggest surprise in a career already full of them. </p></div>"|18240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18240-okkyung-lee-ghil/|7.5|Marc Masters

It’s not even an album: it’s a widely available, 16-year old collection of B-sides from a <i>double album. </i>Granted, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins"">Smashing Pumpkins</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17389-mellon-collie-and-the-infinite-sadness/""><i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness </i></a>was more judiciously edited than the title would lead you to believe. It was a 28-song double album all the same, and now <i>Aeroplane </i>nearly quadruples in size with 90 additional tracks on top of its original 33, with a bonus DVD to boot. But while the numbers make <i>The Aeroplane Flies High </i>the most difficult Smashing Pumpkins reissue to <i>endure</i>, it’s actually the easiest to revisit. For most listeners, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition/""><i>Siamese Dream </i></a>and <i>Mellon Collie </i>are inseparable from the memories of living with those records at a certain age; it’s tough to rehear “Disarm” or “X.Y.U.” without recalling the specific sensory triggers of your parents' house or the details of a particularly shitty day in 10th grade when [INSERT NAME HERE] didn’t reciprocate your crush on them. <i>Aeroplane </i>simply reminds the listener of what it was like to be a Smashing Pumpkins fan when people were expected to pay money for music.</p>
<p>It was equally exhilarating and exhausting during the band’s prime. If you caught the videos on MTV and chose to take your Pumpkins fanship to the next level by exploring the deep cuts, the bootlegs, the formative guitar tablature sites, and so forth, you realized that Billy Corgan was every bit as excited about the music of Smashing Pumpkins as his audience. In fact, that probably strikes at the root of everything you’ve come to loathe about Corgan as well: he’s the biggest Smashing Pumpkins fan on earth.</p>
<p>So while <i>Aeroplane </i>was always meant as a collector’s item, Corgan made it worth your while. Even if you bought it out of obligation and never even listened to the thing, it was one of the 90s’ most handsome and unique physical packages: five CD singles with their own art design, delivered in a hypno-swirled carrying case. It was a keepsake and a conversation piece, a vinyl era throwback for kids who assumed the CD era would last forever. So even if the songs themselves were dashed off (Corgan claimed “Pennies” took literally minutes to write) or slapped together (the very literal 23-minute guitar collage “Pastichio Medley”), there was nothing half-assed about the actual product.</p>
<p>Separating the B-sides onto five separate CDs ensured that the collection was no mere data dump in terms of quality and presentation. If you let your ears go slack a little, every EP retains some important characteristic of its linchpin <i>Mellon Collie </i>single. It’s not an <i>exact</i> fit; with the exception of the country and western curio “Said Sadly”, <i>Bullet With Butterfly Wings </i>is the “covers” EP and the selections brought the new wave genealogy of that song to the fore. The keeper of the bunch is their take on Blondie’s “Dreaming”; not only does it feature a rare lead vocal from bassist D’arcy, but the requisitely light, billowy arrangement distinguishes it from their competent Cars and Alice Cooper karaoke and a fumbled cover of the Cure’s “A Night Like This” where James Iha can’t decide if he wants to perform it as a country, slowcore, or shoegaze song.</p>
<p><i>Tonight, Tonight </i>is technically the “ballad” single-- it is the one with the strings and all. Yet, its sumptuous studio arrangement bares no similarity to its attendant outtakes which are mostly solo, acoustic performances from Corgan. Even compared to the spare and wistful lullabies from their previous odds-and-ends collection <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16929-pisces-iscariot/""><i>Pisces Iscariot </i></a>such as “Whir” and “Obscured”<i>, </i>the songs here sound incomplete rather than realized minimalism. If you’re trying to fashion a four-star Smashing Pumpkins album out of the original B-sides-- and really, that seems like the entire point-- you can skip those two EPs altogether.</p>
<p>On the other side, everything on the <i>1979 </i>single warrants inclusion. The most-beloved Smashing Pumpkins single gives these songs a certain halo effect, of course. Beyond that, the lightly carbonated college rock of “The Boy” is easily the best thing James Iha has ever written, while the whispered restraint lent to the could-be power ballad “Believe” puts it as the runner up. More intriguing is how in 20 minutes, the fluorescent and fizzy <i>1979</i> lays out an intriguing “what if?” for the Smashing Pumpkins. While <i>Adore </i>is known as their synth album and a sonic outlier amidst Corgan’s ambitions for Sistine Chapel art-rock, it’s still a 70-minute opus draped in black and smeared with kohl eyeliner. “Ugly” and “Set the Ray to Jerry” are two sides of a coin and together they present a fascinating alternative to <i>Adore</i>: the former a self-hate song driven by palm-muted, bristling guitar and the latter a love song of swirling, phased ambience. Is it possible they could’ve made a minimalist, melody-driven new wave album following in that vein? I have my doubts-- for all his generosity in the realm of B-sides and miscellany, albums are a <i>huge event </i>for Corgan<i> </i>and we’ll never know if “Set the Ray” would’ve included triple-guitar harmonies or if Jimmy Chamberlin’s barnstorming drum rolls would’ve found a way onto “Cherry”.</p>
<p>If you want those aspects of Smashing Pumpkins, you can head straight to the <i>Zero </i>EP, which, like the titular single, is the most immediately satisfying of the bunch and the quickest to lose its appeal. “God” rages with such Neanderthal impulses, it’s actually <i>fun; </i>it’s basically “Bullet With Butterfly Wings” if you fast forward straight to the avalanche of its coda. The relatively raw glam-grunge of “Mouths of Babes” and “Marquis in Spades” has an underdog appeal if you somehow thought <i>Mellon Collie </i>was hindered by its concept album ambitions or ever mistook Smashing Pumpkins as being a punk or indie band at some point; but as far as riffs or melodies or dynamics go, they’re all second-tier Corgan compositions.</p>
<p>That leaves us with <i>Thirty-Three</i>, the oft-forgotten single from<i> Mellon Collie </i>and the least typical of the lot. The rest of the EP follows suit, as it bears the collection’s most risky and disparate offerings; you  get the prettiest cover (“My Blue Heaven”) and the sludgiest, slowest guitar workout (“The Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left Looks Right)”). The electro-spazz of “Transformer” segues into Iha’s ornate, porcelain art-pop offering “The Bells”. And it’s all preceded by the showstopping closer on your hypothetical <i>Aeroplane </i>single-CD; containing one of Corgan’s most sweet and yearning vocal performances as well as guitar solo from his father, “The Last Song” feels too crucial to be ignored and too personal to make it onto an album with <i>Mellon Collie’s </i>overt commercial ambitions.</p>
<p>And those are all things you can surmise from buying the original version of <i>Aeroplane Flies High</i>; the tracks have been remastered here, though liars and professional audio engineers are the only people who will claim to notice the effect. Like every Pumpkins reissue, <i>Aeroplane </i>is stocked with extras; the difference here is that they’re jammed onto each single seemingly at random, rather than separated into bonus discs. As a result, the tasteful and accessible arrangement of the original is compromised, negating one of its best qualities. For example, why are <i>15 </i>tracks of instrumental jamming slapped onto <i>Bullet With Butterfly Wings</i>? And these aren’t snippets either, some go on for five minutes, and mostly prove that while Smashing Pumpkins <i>songs </i>are pantheon material, Smashing Pumpkins <i>riffs </i>are fairly easy to come by. As works in progress, they’re nothing particularly special; it’d be more interesting if Corgan granted a Creative Commons License as part of the purchase price and allowed fans to use his scraps to come up with their best Smashing Pumpkins imitation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, do we need the Smashing Pumpkins’ July 1995 performance at Chicago’s Double Door <i>and </i>their rehearsal? The DD rehearsal is spirited and ragged, notable for Corgan cracking up during “By Starlight” of all things and reconfiguring the lyrics of “God”. As far as the actual performance, you almost wish Corgan would <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDndsvjyIG4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">get all Patton Oswalt on the dude who’s yelling</a> in the middle of “Stumbleine”. Forget all of those-- head straight to “Special Winner’s Song”, which is five minutes of interactive crowd participation and <i>an improvised rap </i>by James Iha who is presumably drunk as shit. Hearing him yell, “D’arcy Wretzky on the motherfucking bass!” makes the whole endeavor somehow worth it because it’s one of the few times you might imagine the Smashing Pumpkins being four people who enjoyed each other’s company.</p>
<p>With all that said, <i>Aeroplane </i>gives you insight to what a tremendous strain it must’ve been to be a member of the Smashing Pumpkins-- if listening to everything on <i>Aeroplane Flies High </i>seems taxing, imagine playing it. And imagine that what ended up on this still somehow isn’t the sum total of their recorded output at the time. On a basic level, the supersizing of <i>Aeroplane </i>magnifies what it was back in 1996, a point where Corgan’s giving nature felt more like neediness, where the generosity started to lose its altruism and became an oppressive act. The deluxe reissuing of Smashing Pumpkins’ heyday has resulted in upwards of 200 bonus tracks and the ones on <i>Aeroplane </i>are almost entirely inessential. You learn from the eight-track demo of “Zero” that it needs vocals and it needs Jimmy Chamberlain. You learn from the live version that it <i>doesn’t </i>need 50% more whammy pedal soloing. If it’s easy to revisit <i>Aeroplane</i> without getting emotionally attached, it’s harder to talk about for the same reason. But it gets us one step closer to reevaluating <i>Adore, </i>the first Pumpkins record that underperformed commercially and critically, whose legacy is still somewhat in flux. And that’s a worthy cause even if <i>Aeroplane </i>couldn’t possibly justify its price tag.</p></div>"|18259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18259-the-smashing-pumpkins-the-aeroplane-flies-high/|7.0|Ian Cohen

Any album that ends with “Where’s the Indifference Now”, portraying a suicide, unanswered questions and grieving survivors, would seem to fit that bill. But then, part of what makes <i>Dear Mark J. Mulcahy I Love You</i> so distinct in an already dinstinctive career that stretches back to Mulcahy fronting Miracle Legion in the 1980s, is its bright, easygoing, and often upbeat feel.</p>
<p><i>Dear Mark J. Mulcahy</i> makes no bones about where it sits musically. Early on, the basic scope is set: Imagine an early 70s never-never world of incipient glam rock and folky pop, UK style. Think of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">David Bowie</a> if his glam peak was actually <i>Hunky Dory</i> (“He’s a Magnet” manages the neat trick of suggesting Bowie’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a> tribute “Queen Bitch” without actually sounding like it) or, even more particularly given Mulcahy’s singing style, if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a>’s high point was the self-titled album instead of <i>Electric Warrior</i>. Mulcahy’s knowledge of history shows through in the details: many younger musicians miss these particular artists’ smaller moments in favor of the well-worn higher profile ones.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But while you get a sense of his hard-earned knowledge, Mulcahy doesn't come off as world weary. The previously mentioned “Where’s the Indifference Now” may have a serious subject, but the arrangement is engaging, down to a concluding electric guitar solo, Mulcahy’s singing an energetic rumination that matches the thoughtful lyrics. Similarly, “Poison Candy Heart” may be about a failed relationship, but lines like “I saw you kissing the paperboy” are backed by music that moves sweetly along-- the descending keyboard melody that appears with the first chorus is pure delight, as is a chorused whistling break that mirrors a brief solo introduction to the song. These are representative of <i>Dear Mark J. Mulcahy</i> in general: What drives this record throughout is gentle playfulness.</p>
<p>On a lyrical level, Mulcahy offers quick, vivid portraits of people and situations. Early on, the rumbling stomp of “Everybody Hustles Leo” gives a sense of what surprises Mulcahy is capable of: the verses seem to suggest straightforward (if not simply straight) talk about a woman ""who can get milk from a crowbar,"" among other metaphors. But then the chorus makes it seem like it’s a song about a man, or perhaps someone gay, or a trans individual, maybe something else entirely. And it’s all over and done in two and a half minutes, followed by a slower, steadier groove with another intriguing title “She Makes the World Turn Backwards,” featuring a call and response starting with a hoary medical chestnut: “Where does it hurt?” “Everywhere!”</p>
<p>That so much on <i>Dear Mark J. Mulcahy</i> should be playful without being straight-up comedy songs or heavy-handed ""jokes"" is one of its best gifts; it’s pretty easy to find yourself starting to lock into turns of phrase rather than letting them pass by in the flow. To pick out three at random: from “Everybody Hustles Leo”: “Who cares, as long as it’s white and you can snort it”;  “He’s a Magnet”: “Lady what’s that book you’re reading/ Oh, the Bible/ That’s so interesting/ They’ve got a word for everything in there”; “Bailing Out on Everything Again”: “Now I smell trouble/ You had better roll down the window.”</p>
<p>But if it were all jokes this would be stand-up or spoken-word. That “Let The Fireflies Fly Away” should start with the music settling in while Mulcahy delivers another well-worn joke setup “Waiter, there’s a frog in my...” is one thing. But it’s another when he repeats the phrase only to have a backing chorus add in a “Waiter!” of its own, all with the feeling of one-take ease. (Paul Q. Kolderie’s mixing ear throughout is top notch, everything fitting in just the right place.)</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Dear Mark J Mulcahy</i> often have codas that are honest-to-god codas-- different keys, lyrics that tie up or tie together a song, new instruments introduced-- while there are enough notable moments of instrumental bliss, such as the blended guitar parts on “The Rabbit” or the numerous differing drum fills on “My Rose Colored Friend”, that need no explanation when the pleasure one gets from listening to them is so immediate. From start to finish, <i>Dear Mark J. Mulcahy</i> is a treat. In fact, it may be his best yet.</p></div>"|18251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18251-mark-mulcahy-dear-mark-j-mulcahy-i-love-you/|7.7|Ned Raggett

But for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6491-david-yow/"">David Yow</a>, on solo duties for the first time after years spent baiting audiences as the frontman of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6194-scratch-acid/"">Scratch Acid</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"">the Jesus Lizard</a>, it's a minor footnote to a wildly unpredictable record. To say it's uncompromising would be correct, although somewhat redundant, as he hasn't ever dealt in half measures. But this is not the sound of a sweat-soaked Yow plunging into a crowd and rubbing his blubbery belly all over the faces in the front row; Instead, it's a studio creation, cut somewhere between the art-fun antics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3563-the-residents/"">the Residents</a>, old horror movie soundtracks, classical leanings, a streak of digital noise, a burst of Spanish guitar, text messages translated by computer software, and a recording of Yow squeezing a cat.</p>
<p><i>Tonight You Look Like a Spider</i> is an album that has been 15 years in the making, once destined to be released by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5804-mike-patton/"">Mike Patton</a>'s <a href=""http://www.ipecac.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ipecac</a>, but ultimately coming out on the <a href=""http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joyful Noise</a> label. Naturally, Yow's new home have heralded its release with a <a href=""http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/how-my-solo-album-happened/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">photo</a> of him with jeans around his ankles, posed in front of a toilet. The picture hovers over a blurb that offers insights such as: ""I named it <i>Tonight You Look Like a Spider</i> after a spider I saw one night."" Don't look to Yow for any easy explanations for this stuff, but it's better that way, just left hanging out there for people to determine their own interpretation. It's mostly instrumental, alternately brilliant and terrible, sometimes focused, at other times hopelessly rambling. Yow would probably admit as much himself. ""The record is kind of retarded in a lot of ways,"" he said in a recent <a href=""http://vishkhanna.com/2013/06/25/ep-9-david-yow/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">podcast</a> by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vish_Khanna"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vish Khanna</a>.</p>
<p>On cursory listens there might not appear to be much that ties this work to Yow's former persona as a drooling, babbling rock beast, but it's pulled from a similar sensibility. He admits to having no formal musical training or even knowing how chords work-- essentially, this is an album that's as psychotic as his live shows with the Jesus Lizard, both of which hinge on the premise that the less you know, the more demented you can get. Part of Yow's success as a vocalist and performer was because there was really no one like him; similarly, this album works best when he's fully committed to making a creation without peer. Its failings come when he edges toward the familiar, at times resembling a dollar store <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a>, stuck with MIDI presets in a rotting basement instead of large orchestras in an expansive studio.</p>
<p>For someone who worked so well with concision in his other bands, it's a surprise to find out that Yow works best over great lengths of time in his solo guise. The two 10-minute-plus tracks are the best pieces here, one heading off on a million tangents (""Opening Suite""), the other closeted in a gradually unfurling drone that resembles a slowed-down air raid siren (""Visualize This""). The rest feels like a mixture of Yow amusing himself, sometimes hitting on a strain of inspiration, but just as often tailing off into inconsequential meanderings when the ideas run dry. At its most playful it feels like an army of ringing alarm clocks pounding on your head (""Uncle""), or mirrors the kind of pithy spoken word rants <a href=""http://annmagnuson.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ann Magnuson</a> would undertake in <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Bongwater"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bongwater</a> (""Senator Robinson's Speech""). Of course, the track that comes closest to beauty, full of dark piano stabs spun through a spooky ambient fog, is called ""Lawrence of a Labia"".</p>
<p>Albums recorded over ample stretches of time often don't hold together well, and <i>Tonight</i> is no exception. Sometimes the sounds are horribly dated-- synth-induced slap bass sounds that border on the ""Seinfeld""-ian, even a hint of<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8340-al-jourgensen/""> Al Jourgensen</a>'s industrial emptiness in ""Bleth My Thoul"" (presumably some unspecified private joke Yow is inflicting on his audience). Although one of the strengths of this album is that it's clearly coming straight out of a void, oblivious to anything else around it, there's also a childlike wonder coupled with a decent understanding of the gruesome side of life. Yow's vocal work had that, too. In the times when he wasn't jumping into the audience at Jesus Lizard shows there was something decidedly creepy about him, a feeling of the paunchy uncle with whisky on his breath, cornering you and asking uncomfortable questions. Still, he doesn't quite see it that way. When asked about it on Khanna's podcast, Yow simply responded: ""Am I scary? I’m just ugly.""</p></div>"|18209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18209-david-yow-tonight-you-look-like-a-spider/|6.5|Nick Neyland

They are not the same game, though. If you read the back cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>’s 1975 album, <i>Discreet Music</i>, you’ll find a set of diagrams and instructions meant to explain the processes that the producer/composer/guru employed in creating the music. The record, which is often cited as one of the formative works of the ambient genre, contains a series of slowly evolving compositions that rely on slight variations (measure length, echo, equalization) of simple repeating melodic phrases to create a sense of movement amid static components.</p>
<p>That same year also saw the debut release by the San Francisco, California-based composer <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31452-iasos/"">Iasos</a>, who would become heavily identified with the then emerging new age genre. Though his compositions are shorter and draw heavy inspiration from spiritual jazz, there are plenty of similarities to Eno’s ambient music, particularly in the gauzy tones and glacial pace. The LP did not come with a score and even if Iasos had wanted to include one, the process might have been tough to explain to an outsider. According to the composer, his music was not written, but communicated to him by a trans-dimensional being called Vista.</p>
<p>The purpose of <i>Discreet Music </i>is to fade into the background, to become aural wallpaper that teeters at the edge of comprehension, hence the title. Iasos’ record, <i>Interdimensional Music</i>, requires direct attention. The sounds are not meant to drift on the edge of perception, but expand consciousness-- to transcend Earthly anxiety and envelop the listener in bliss. Like many new age musicians, Iasos was not shy about embracing hokey imagery-- rainbows, crystals, crystalline rainbows-- to get his point accross, and not every track that he cut can transcend the goofiness of his genre. <i>Celestial Soul Portrait</i>, a new compilation assembled by Numero Group, functions as a highlight reel, grabbing some of the sturdiest swatches from the composer’s 30-year-plus career.</p>
<p>Born in Greece and raised in upstate New York, by the late 1960s Iasos had moved to California to devote himself to music, eventually settling in Marin County, near San Francisco. He tried playing in a number of rock bands but found his peers a little too Earth-bound in their tastes. After purchasing a four-track recorder, he started experimenting with tape effects, treated sounds and, eventually, synthesizers, which helped him hone the celestial sound he had been reaching for. On “Rainbow Canyon”, which was taken from <i>Interdimensional Music</i>, Iasos improvises on a lap steel guitar, using an echo unit to smear his notes across the stereo field. Were you to dry it out from the effects, his riffing might just sound like a series of Eastern-tinged goofs, but the constantly sliding tones and delay trails give the music an unearthly quality-- soothing, but also seasick. “Cloud Prayer” congeals from a series of drones that the guitarist created using guitar feedback and a wah-wah pedal. It’s an ominous piece, building tension with the muted buzz of low tones.</p>
<p>The root of Iasos’ music is in late 1960s composers like Terry Riley, who came from a more formal university background, but who also temporarily embraced the current psychedelic moment, experimenting with drones, tape loops, and the structures of Indian music. The compositions on <i>Celestial Soul Portrait</i> carried those ideas forward, but from a folkier, less academic perspective. Still, the stakes were high for Iasos and his inter-dimensional writing partner. “Imagine creating symphonies by tuning up planets [to] create beautiful chords that echo through the galaxy,” explains Iasos in the compilation's liner notes. “That’s the game Vista is playing.”</p></div>"|18238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18238-iasos-celestial-soul-portraits/|7.4|Aaron Leitko

During the last two decades, they’ve released nine albums of headstrong Viking metal, built almost entirely around tales of shared Scandinavian heritage and tunes that either charged like a massive military’s frontline or sailed skyward like a hard-earned victory chant. The best of those records (by mere example, see with <i>Oden on Our Side </i>and <i>Versus the World</i>) have felt both urgent and addictive, combining death metal heft and modern rock-ready hooks to build and brandish verifiable anthems. Indeed, to see Amon Amarth live is to see almost all of an audience throw hands or horns at once, chanting along to stories of wins in war and glory in the afterlife. They are a sort of turbocharged Cliff’s Notes to <i>The Poetic Edda</i> and <i>The Prose Edda</i>, a modern metal band revivifying ancient history with unwavering conviction.</p>
<p>There’s little reason to suspect, then, that Amon Amarth will soon run out of stories to sing; their potential pool of subjects is, in essence, a culture’s complete heritage, and they’ve got tales of Oden and Loke to share yet. And there’s always the option of fan-fiction, or creating imagined sagas of pugnacity and defeat from the lore itself. Of late, though, Amon Amarth has started to run out of, if not songs, then novel ways to make their stories really stick within those songs. After an incredible streak of righteous albums, 2011’s <i>Surtur Rising</i> sometimes felt overly stiff and deliberate, as if Amon Amarth were trying to bully past the limits of their own Viking brand. But the new <i>Deceiver of the Gods</i> feels formulaic and tired, as if the long-running quintet has now settled into the complacency and comfort of their reputation-- bad news, of course, for warriors who end songs with shouts of “Now we attack! Ride into fate!” At last, Amon Amarth has made a record that is every bit as rote, uninspired and matter-of-fact as a set of Cliff’s Notes. In the past, they’ve sounded strangely uplifting; this time around, they simply sound persistent.</p>
<p>The symptoms start as early as the opening title track, a thrashing sprint that flatlines in the chorus and rebounds a bit in a chant-along bridge but ultimately stumbles into a solo so tepid and predictable that it nearly necessitates skipping right along to the next track, “As Loke Falls”. Amon Amarth at least displays some vivacity <i>there</i>, volleying a riff between drums blasts like a game of pinball. Frontman Johan Hegg sounds convincing here, too, delivering the tale of Ragnarök’s end less like a storyteller than a witness. In fact, Hegg is compelling throughout most of <i>Deceiver of the Gods</i>, and he’s got good material to offer. His account of a brutal murder technique called Blood Eagle makes for fine pulp fiction, while “Shape Shifter” uses the life of the god Loke to discuss betrayal and a necessary balance of light and dark. In fact, reading <i>Deceiver of the Gods</i> is arguably more engaging than listening to most of it. The band behind Hegg seems exhausted or, at the very least, over it. They push ahead with the same up-tempo roil so much that any break at all-- be they the sampled sounds of murder at the start of the gruesome “Blood Eagle” or the psychedelic guitar spirals that introduce closer “Warriors of the North”-- are welcome, overdue diversions. Candlemass’ Messiah Marcolin guests on “Hel”, but Amon Amarth is so unyielding that the best they can do is let him moan in the background like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPuYqL2NB1U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marianne Faithful</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not that anyone’s now hoping for Amon Amarth to be metal’s great hybridizers or innovators. Nine albums into a career, no-one expects them to suddenly lace their battle hymns with electronics or noise or to write brilliant black metal bursts or dramatic post-rock crescendos into their records. But Amon Amarth boasts a lot of their own skill, bravery and brilliance within their songs; they are a small army of “endless wrath” and “the walker on the wind” and “fast in thought, quicker tongue.” Here, though, those are only hollow words, self-righteousness from a band bloated on their own lofty reputation and sales history. On <i>Deceiver of the Gods</i>, they are satisfied with plugging 10 new anecdotes into 10 songs they’ve made before and, unfortunately, will most likely make again.</p></div>"|18222.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18222-amon-amarth-deceiver-of-the-gods/|5.6|Grayson Currin

It's to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski/"">William Basinski</a>'s credit that he hasn't let the weight of his most lauded piece, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/""><i>The Disintegration Loops</i></a>, overwhelm him. He still appears proud of that album, releasing an expanded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17064-the-disintegration-loops/"">box-set</a> edition last year, bolstering its reputation instead of shirking from it. It's essentially become a living, breathing thing. Letting <i>The Disintegration Loops</i> take a back seat never felt like much of an option for Basinski anyway. A large part of that album's narrative was spun out of his real-world struggles with his art, triggered by the financial woes he was undergoing prior to its release. The rush of people toward it must have provoked a strong sense of freedom and validation-- not easy emotions to forget, and ones that were presumably not taken for granted by someone in Basinski's circumstance.</p>
<p>His return to <i>The Disintegration Loops</i> also tied into Basinski's ever evolving relationship with his own past, as witnessed by the frequent reworkings of his older material. <i>Nocturnes</i> is his first new solo recording in four years, but the 40-minute-long title track is a return to a tape and prepared piano piece recorded in his San Francisco period circa 1979-80. The second of the two tracks dates back to 2009, parts of which featured in Robert Wilson's opera, <i>The Life and Death of Marina Abramović</i>. Things don't get left behind in Basinski's world, they carry on mutating as the years pass, provoking questions about where things begin and end. ""I have a weird way of living in time,"" he said in an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8983-william-basinski/"">Update</a> interview in 2012. ""I just try to stay in the eternal present.""</p>
<p>Both <i>Nocturnes</i> tracks are wrinkle-free. Immaculate, even. There's nothing that suggests an era in which they might have been recorded. No trace of a dusty old reel-to-reel tape machine, no dated recording techniques. Basinski's relationship to time is key, especially on ""Nocturnes"", where it's easy to lose track of how long its slow-moving loops have been gently rotating around one another. Somehow, Basinski has mastered how to keep material like this interesting, slowly fading in changes, just doing enough to make it immersive. This isn't exactly the ""eternal present"" he refers to-- instead, it feels more like an attempt to manipulate time, to see how malleable its boundaries can be. Seconds pass like weeks, minutes turn into seconds. Often it's hard to tell whether you're at the end or in the middle. Ultimately, those distinctions don't really matter.</p>
<p>The only part of the overall work that takes you out of the moment is in the transition from one track to the other. Initially, the switch is jarring, resembling an alarm clock sounding at a particular inopportune moment in a dream. ""Nocturnes"" is all muddy, languid movement; ""The Trail of Tears"" has a coarser, more agile feel. The latter is a lesser work, making an awkward fit in an album that may have benefitted from containing just one track. ""Nocturnes"" siphons its beauty from the slow-release journey that Basinski instills in it. By contrast, ""The Trail of Tears"" starts by resembling a paint-cracked old rocking chair creaking into infinity, only to drift into a wash of ambient mush. It tilts toward total escapism, taking on a dream-like state. But Basinski's best work isn’t positioned there; he's better when fusing the otherworldly with the real. On ""Nocturnes"", abstract thoughts become one with the music, forming a place so tangible you can almost reach out and touch it.</p></div>"|18282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18282-william-basinski-nocturnes/|7.5|Nick Neyland

Those records got retro-soul revivalist tags stapled on to them, thanks to a hip-hop fiend's sense of vintage soul that drew heavily off Stax/Motown goodwill vibes. But the real scope of his musical influences jump out on the 2011 covers EP, <i>Impressions</i>, where his classic R&amp;B leanings ran the gamut from the well-loved Isleys to the obscure Festivals. He also made a point of taking on some of his blue-eyed soul contemporaries-- artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/"" target=""_blank"">Chromeo</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/574-jon-brion/"" target=""_blank"">Jon Brion</a>, who work adjacent to R&amp;B and funk without necessarily binding themselves to it. If integrating those attributes meant Hawthorne took on multiple pop lineages at once in order to establish a unique identity of his own, it's served him well so far.</p>
<p>As he keeps moving forward and adds on new dimensions to his repertoire, Hawthorne's new album, <i>Where Does This Door Go</i>, gives him a lot of self-imposed leeway. Here he cedes his usual production duties to an all-star cast. There's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/910-cee-lo-green/"" target=""_blank"">Cee-Lo</a> collaborator and Plantlife funkateer Jack Splash, Oak of pop-rap/R&amp;B production superteam Pop &amp; Oak, producer-to-the-stars Greg Wells and-- most prominent of all-- Pharrell Williams, who shares Hawthorne's eccentric depth and enthusiasm for modernized, chronology-twisting sounds. That Hawthorne's wrangled this crew into a consistently engaged sound is to his credit, where his impact is tangible enough that the committee effect takes a backseat.</p>
<p>Hawthorne deliberately shaking his throwback rep is probably the best thing you could expect from <i>Where Does This Door Go</i>: the songs sound clean and of the now, aided by people who successfully mine the last couple generations' best pop ideas. That this music sounds sly without actually feeling like a joke is impressive-- there's too much practiced musicianship in songs like the breezy quiet storm<i>-</i>via-<i>Private Eyes </i>“Backseat Lover” or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3021-nerd/"" target=""_blank"">N.E.R.D.</a><i>-</i>does<i>-Aja </i>bounce of “Reach Out Richard"". This wouldn't be the first review comparing Hawthorne's sensibility to '77 Steely Dan or '81 Hall &amp; Oates, but those admittedly fitting touchstones mean that even through production proxies, he's springboarding off of artists who were already looking at the horizon and the rearview at the same time. Retro isn't the same thing as timeless, and this album trades up in taking that second route.</p>
<p>It helps that Hawthorne's improved noticeably as a singer. Once a tolerably flat if charismatic vocalist, he's expanded his range and his confidence. His falsetto's finally started to resonate as charmingly vulnerable instead of just withdrawn, he's gotten better at sounding eccentric without forcing it (dig the way he casually rolls off the oddball pronunciation of “Chris-ti-an-Di-or” on “Wine Glass Woman”), and his penchant for interjecting f-bombs in otherwise sweetly sung lyrics comes across more frankly sincere than gratuitously snotty. Those lyrics are more straightforward than ever: Like a lot of the music he's called back to over the years, it's stuff that lives and dies on its delivery. He can fit in some neat turns of phrase; “She walks into a room and all the lights flicker violently” is a vivid way to start “The Innocent”. But just as many songs attempt to build a lot out of a little, like the yearbook-quote simplicity of teenage weekend bender anthem “The Stars Are Ours” (“Well we're breakin' all the rules/ 'cause they're getting in the way/ And we'll never be as young as we are today”) or the bad-sex-as-tired-machinery conceit of “Robot Love"". Still, it never gets cringingly obvious enough to feel like the performance can't redeem the ordinary-at-worst lyrics.</p>
<p><i>Where Does This Door Go </i>is a record that's equally focused on delivering mildly self-effacing party jams and empathetic moments of connection. Women are both predatory seductresses to be avoided (“The Innocent”) and sympathetic done-wrong figures to identify with (the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"" target=""_blank"">Jessie Ware</a>-featuring “Her Favorite Song”). Moments of post-hedonistic defensiveness (“Crime,” which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a> reliably owns) are followed by an apologetic yet reassuring monologue to his father (“Reach Out Richard”). Inconsistency or complexity? Depends on how much you believe in this music as sincere self-expression versus its status as smartly crafted, artist-as-listener-proxy pop. Three albums in to a late-blooming career, it's getting easier and easier to picture Hawthorne, a DJ-turned-singer and fan-turned-musician, pulling off both.</p></div>"|18257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18257-mayer-hawthorne-where-does-this-door-go/|7.1|Nate Patrin

Ty Dolla $ign’s talents recently landed him a deal with Atlantic Records via Wiz Khalifa’s Taylor Gang imprint, and he celebrated the occasion this month with the release of <i>Beach House 2</i>. The sequel follows on the lead of the original, but where <i>Beach House </i>presented a summation of the artist’s varying talents, <i>Beach House 2</i> feels like a dry run for the majors, weighted down by a glut of largely ineffectual guest raps, songs recycled from other artists’ mixtapes and remixes of songs that didn’t really need fixing.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Dolla $ign’s arrangements are lush and intriguing on songs like “I Bet”, which matches oceanic synths to subterranean bass in the verses before a wash of keys overtake the mix at every chorus. All of the outside producers he calls on follow his lead by striking a precarious balance between house music and Southern hip-hop, mostly to dazzling results. But his impish lyricism wages a continual warfare with the sweetness of the music, and it occasionally makes for rough listening. You can snicker at darts like “I took his main bitch away like King Koopa” on “Creez”, but you have to sneak past a minefield of “These hoes be playing games for nothing” and “These bitches ain’t shit” to get there. It gets ugly on “Bitches Ain’t Shit”, where Ty$ graces a spectral, druggy production with a yarn about stealing a guy’s girlfriend containing a bridge where he tells the girl “Your nigga laid up in the hospital, and you still think of me/ Man, I swear to God I’d kill your fucking ass if you did that shit to me”. It illuminates the extent to which the mawkish depravity of Ty’s songs feels like an end in itself. R&amp;B knows no shortage of dirtbag auteurs, but where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"" target=""_blank"">R. Kelly</a> bedded paramours with searching lines like “It seems like you’re ready”, and the Weeknd’s creep tendencies are points of consternation for him, Ty Dolla $ign treats these situations like bloodless coups, full of boyfriends ripe for the beating and women who are play things rather than companions, whose fealty &amp; attraction to him are a foregone conclusion. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Beach House 2</i>’s problems with writing aren’t confined to Ty$; its guests spots are a mixed bag. The contributions from Dolla $ign’s Cali rap cohorts rank among the best. Heart Break Gang’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31412-iamsu/"" target=""_blank"">Iamsu!</a> turns in a capable performance on “Float” (off his own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18236-iamsu-kilt-ii/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kilt II</i></a>), and YG and DJ Mustard inject much-needed levity into “Dolla $ign”, which cleverly flips the “All I see is dollar signs” from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"" target=""_blank"">Rihanna</a>’s “Pour It Up”. Joe Moses, co-star of Ty’s 2012 mixtape <i>Whoop!</i>, delivers the mixtape’s best verse on “Paranoid” (off DJ Mustard’s underrated <i>Ketchup </i>tape). By and large, though, the tracklist here is a rogue’s gallery of Atlantic Records signees, and many of them seem to appear out of label affiliation rather than genuine chemistry. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"" target=""_blank"">Juicy J</a>’s creepy uncle act meshes perfectly with “Ratchet in My Benz”, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31127-kevin-gates/"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Gates</a> shines on “These Hoes” when you can hear him over the beat. But <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> mimic Kirko Bangz faceplant on two separate songs apiece, and Taylor Gang associate Chevy Woods is sluggish and forgettable on “Bitches Ain’t Shit”. Ty snagging Jeezy for the massive “My Cabana” remix only to have him flop by singing his verse is emblematic of <i>Beach House 2</i>’s frustrating misuse of star power.</p>
<p class=""p2""><i>Beach House 2</i> is peppered with skeezy dirtbag narratives and cringeworthy guest raps that bring it down, but Ty Dolla $ign’s melodies and production are almost strong enough to wash them out of earshot. If you’re not picking over this thing for lyrics you might not catch some of this stuff for all the interlocking hooks and deft vocal runs, and there isn’t anything here more shocking than the offbeat sexual politics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus</i></a>. What’s most off-putting about <i>Beach House 2</i> is how ill-suited the dead-eyed resignation of Ty Dolla $ign’s approach is to the warmth of his voice. “I got another nigga bitch in my bed right now/ She got her legs all up in the air... right now”. <i>Yawn</i>. “These hoes ain’t shit, but I’ma fuck this bitch”. <i>Stretch</i>. <i>Beach House 2</i> is gratingly drunk on its own bedroom swashbuckling, like an hour-long teenage locker room sex story set to painstakingly pretty music. <span>Given the opportunity to tell a fascinating story, he instead opts to fixate on how cunning and virile he is to have gotten there in the first place. </span>There’s satisfaction in the telling but not as much in the listening.</p></div>"|18309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18309-ty-dolla-ign-beach-house-2/|6.7|Craig Jenkins

But on <i>About Farewell, </i>her fourth record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6327-alela-diane/"" target=""_blank"">Alela Diane</a> comes by her romantic devastation honestly. The Portland-based folkie was last heard on 2011’s excellent <i>Alela Diane &amp; Wild Divine</i>, where she was backed by a crack band equally conversant in soul, country, and 1970s SoCal soft-rock. Diane’s musical co-pilot was guitarist Tom Bevitori, also her husband at the time. Sadly, the marriage ended between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15276-alela-diane-wild-divine/"" target=""_blank""><i>Alela Diane &amp; Wild Divine </i></a>and <i>About Farewell, </i>prompting a return to the stark guitar-and-voice arrangements of Diane’s early work on a collection of songs that ache with the specificity of poetic reportage on the last flickers of a doomed relationship.</p>
<p><i>About Farewell </i>is a backward-looking record for Diane, musically and lyrically, but it’s also a reboot of sorts. Superficially it resembles her stunning 2004 debut, <i>The Pirate’s Gospel</i>, except it sounds more grown-up. The understated sumptuousness of <i>Alela Diane &amp; Wild Divine<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15276-alela-diane-wild-divine/"" target=""_blank""> </a></i>is mostly gone (and keenly missed), though Diane finds way to work that record’s expansiveness into the cozier confines of <i>About Farewell. </i>On the foreboding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15126-alela-diane-the-way-we-fall/"" target=""_blank"">“The Way We Fall”</a>, which sketches an evocative setting-- it’s Indian summer, there are wildfires burning, and a whiskey bottle is being passed around-- that feels like a bittersweet memory, muted horns and a muffled drum track soften the barbed-wire tentacles of Diane’s skeletal guitar and ghostly backing vocals. On “Nothing I Can Do”, the frustration expressed so beautifully in the chorus (“Honey there is nothing I can do/ to save you from yourself”) turns playful with the introduction of gently pirouetting piano ringlets.</p>
<p>The star of the show, as always on Alela Diane records, is Diane’s voice. Nimble and graceful like a jazz singer, sad and knowing like a blues crooner, but always restrained like a bedroom-pop auteur speaking softly into a four-track, Diane delivers her detached observations on the end of her marriage with stinging intimacy. “Before the Leaving” is a melancholic travelogue from the perspective of two traveling musicians who are slowly drifting apart. “Side by side we pass through towns/ that we’ll never see/ and it’s here I will wait out the storm,” she sings, drawing out that last part a few extra painful beats. The album’s saddest track-- the competition on<i> About Farewell </i> is fierce for the distinction-- is “Hazel Street”, where Diane suggests that the coupling was troubled from the beginning. (“I woke up drunk on that basement floor/and then you asked how I would read the score/ If you asked me to marry you.”) Diane is similarly fatalistic on the lilting “I Thought I Knew”, when she sighs, “I’d only just arrived/ when I foresaw the end.”</p>
<p>A record seemingly composed over the course of many sleepless nights and hungover mornings, <i>About Farewell </i>is yet another addition to the canon of brokenhearted sadsack singer-songwriter records. Surely there will be another artist attempting to make their own <i>Blood on the Tracks </i>or <i>Blue </i>very soon. Alela Diane hasn’t upended the form, but that probably wasn’t her intent. What she needed was a port in a storm, and <i>About Farewell </i>is a very sturdy bulwark.</p></div>"|18265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18265-alela-diane-about-farewell/|7.3|Steven Hyden

Under this lineup, they released a series of splits and one full-length, 2009's <i>Deconstruct</i>. They've since abandoned the dualing genders angle; Kracheni was replaced by Rahi Geramifar, currently of Houston's War Master and formerly of grindcore insurgents Insect Warfare. Geramifar also guested on <i>Deconstruct</i>, credited as “Gargling Urine”; his guttural vocals live to that moniker in his other bands, but they were somewhat redundant placed alongside Hughes.</p>
<p>Now, almost a decade after forming, Hatred Surge are a trio, rounded out by long-standing members Chris Ulsh (also of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31190-power-trip/"" target=""_blank"">Power Trip</a>, Mammoth Grinder, and the Impalers) on guitar and drummer Mike Sharp (who's played in the Impalers as well, in addition to Sungod and a former stint in Trap Them), with Hughes taking over all vocal duties.<i> Human Overdose</i>, released during the recent Chaos in Tejas festival in Austin, is their first record as a three-piece, and it's their burliest, most focused yet.</p>
<p>Ulsh's guitar work in Mammoth Grinder, which combines death metal, Discharge, and the “power groove” sound pioneered by Pantera, creep into <i>Overdose</i>, especially in the longer songs. Those seeds were sown when the Hatred Surge did a split with Mammoth Grinder-- Hughes and Ulsh essentially doing a split with themselves-- in 2011, and now they've sprouted fatally poisonous berries. Nowhere is this more apparent than in “Psychonaut”, which could easily be a Mammoth Grinder song if it weren't for Hughes' deep growl. A galloping intro breaks way into a Swedeath catharsis. The intro riff on “God Complex” brings to mind a more fluid, less mechanical Prong, and “Delta Nine” jerky swings are among the most “power groovy” riffs on the record. In fact, the swifter songs on this album are like Pantera's “Slaughtered” raised on punk, right down to the lyrics, exploring the link between social corruption and the breakdown of one's inner will.</p>
<p>Travis Bonner's production lends <i>Overdose</i> a stronger death metal feel than their previous work, emphasizing downtuned crunch and smearing it just enough without turning the album into incoherent “bestial” beige. With the album's focus on concise, concentrated explosions, the ambient intro “Figurehead” feels like a blockade (not endless, thankfully) to the emotional release of “Psychonaut”. Those electronics appear again at the very end of the title track, also the record's closing number, in a shorter, more fitting fashion. <i>Overdose</i>'s consistent quality renders this less of a gaping flesh wound and more of an annoying scab, really.</p>
<p>Hatred Surge could be the spiritual successor of Iron Age, another Austin band Hughes took part in. Iron Age started as another hardcore band with some metal influences, but by 2009's <i>The Sleeping Eye,</i> they morphed into a beast with crossover's ferocity and Manilla Road's sense of grandeur. It's useless to ask “what could have been,” especially in a genre with vocal contingents of fans who inquire about Cliff Burton and Lars Ulrich switching spots on the bus, but Iron Age were definitely onto something a lot of their revivalist peers were not, save for Power Trip. Hatred Surge, likewise, by incorporating more metal into their sound, have both matured and grown even heavier than before.</p></div>"|18278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18278-hatred-surge-human-overdose/|7.5|Andy O'Connor

In '77, the comedian (or, as he preferred, ""song-and-dance man"") was 28 years old, and his bits were marked by wide-eyed innocence. At that point, it often seemed like his characters were pre-pubescent or eerily unaware of the adult world; in fact, much of his material at the time was culled from previous stints entertaining childrens' birthday parties as a teenager or hosting a kids' show, ""Uncle Andy's Funhouse,"" in college. For Kaufman, retaining this child-like perspective was essential-- he even took up Transcendental Meditation in an attempt to hold onto this aura as he entered his twenties-- and it helped to inspire a similar feeling in his audience, to make them think back to a time before bills and heartbreak and death. A <a href=""http://youtu.be/CjNlT3CL6yE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TV special he taped in the summer of 1977</a> epitomized this era as it featured his hopelessly naive Foreign Man character, a sincere interview with Kaufman's childhood idol Howdy Doody, and a step-by-step tutorial on how to make chocolate milk. The showcase ended with a sing-along to a song called <a href=""http://youtu.be/41n3mwCcZQ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Friendly World""</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Due to its unabashedly offbeat nature (is he kidding? is he serious? what <i>is</i> he?) that special was shelved and would not air until two years later, after Kaufman had gained more fame with his role on <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077089/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Taxi""</a>. But by then, in the summer of '79, the performer had, as one TV critic put it, ""turned."" He had started wrestling women onstage because he loved wrestling and its ridiculous theater. He also found the activity quite arousing and, according to Bill Zehme's definitive biography <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Funhouse-Life-Mind-Kaufman/dp/0385333722"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Lost in the Funhouse</i></a>, it was a good way for Kaufman to break the ice with girls he wanted to have sex with after the show. Not very innocent. He also invented a new character, <a href=""http://youtu.be/8zpNIomYAkE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tony Clifton</a>, who was the exact opposite of his lovable <a href=""http://youtu.be/pjYDSi1ZUcY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Foreign Man</a>-- a Vegas-style lout in a bad toupee, tumbling gut, and hideous moustache. Clifton was pure id, a reaction against Kaufman's kid-friendly former self. Looking back, that period between '77 and '79 was especially pivotal for Kaufman-- it's also the timeframe when he taped 82 hours of audio from his everyday life onto his newly purchased microcassette recorder. A keenly edited version of those tapes make up the 48 minutes of <i>Andy and His Grandmother</i>, a comedy album that is, fittingly, unlike any other.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The inspiration behind Kaufman's home recordings may be a man that his confidant and co-conspirator <a href=""http://youtu.be/rlFZ35R3CSw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bob Zmuda</a> calls Mr. X (due to fear of retribution) in his book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Andy-Kaufman-Revealed-Friend-Tells/dp/0316681237/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373919466&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Andy+Kaufman+Revealed%21"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Andy Kaufman Revealed!</i></a>. Zmuda worked for this apparently psychotic Hollywood screenwriter who would get himself into dangerous or outlandish real-life situations-- like insulting a mob boss' mother at her birthday dinner-- record them on audiotape, and then use those recordings as catalysts for his writing. Such mixing of fact and fiction was catnip for Kaufman, whose life often seemed like a series of pranks and put-ons. So <i>Andy and His Grandmother</i>-- compiled by veteran comedy writer/producer <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0154074/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vernon Chatman</a> (""Louie"", ""South Park"", ""The Chris Rock Show"") and documentarian <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038896/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rodney Ascher</a> (the <i>Shining</i>-obsessed <i>Room 237</i>)-- isn't merely a recording of Kaufman's stand-up performances, but rather recordings of real-life conversations that would plant creative seeds in his eccentric mind. Considering that many of the record's most memorable moments document wildly heated phone calls, it can seem like <i>Andy and His Grandmother</i> is more similar to a Jerky Boys album than comedy classics by Steve Martin or Bill Cosby.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Because, by-and-large, this is a record of provocation. It's also probably one of the most clear-eyed accounts of the ""real"" Andy Kaufman in existence, a serious feat considering his notoriously slippery relationship with what most of us call reality. The candidness here can be startling, even by 2013 standards. A track called ""Slice of Life"" has Kaufman talking to one of the many women he bedded while on tour in the late 70s. ""We just screwed and here's the afterward conversation,"" he announces, before continuing: ""It didn't look to me like you were enjoying it that much."" But this isn't laugh-out-loud funny. It's unflinching. He asks her, ""What happens if you got a baby?"" to which the unnamed woman responds, ""I'll hop a plane to Toronto and get a little abortion."" Naturally, she asks for him to turn off the tape (there's an entire track here devoted to the voices of people requesting-- often in an incensed tone-- for Kaufman to ""shut that off"") but he's adamant: ""Why is it that nobody understands that the kind of conversations that nobody wants me to tape are the kind of conversations that <i>should</i> be taped?"" It's the sort of philosophy that runs through the work of many great comedians, from Woody Allen to Louis C.K., laid perfectly bare, without the filter of a camera lens, script, or stand-up routine.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Later on, a series of phone calls show up in which Kaufman diabolically riles up a woman who doesn't appreciate her feelings being used as some sort of meta comedy exercise. ""You are fucked up!"" she screams. ""I WANT THOSE FUCKING TAPES!"" The call is followed by Zmuda and Kaufman plotting how they could release the contentious conversations with this one tremendously angry woman as an album. ""The concept would be funny because it's real, but it would be dramatic at the same time,"" Kaufman says, before excitedly suggesting to Zmuda, ""Wouldn't it be great if she killed me and you have the tapes?"" It's uncomfortable comedy, the kind that Kaufman would perfect with Tony Clifton and his inter-gender wrestling career. And these talks with various women accentuate the more problematic sides of his personality, the parts that were addicted to prostitutes and womanizing. ""He <i>hated</i> that he needed to be with women,"" says friend Wendy Polland in <i>Lost in the Funhouse</i>, ""because he didn't like the mind games they played with him. Which I guess was sort of ironic, wasn't it?"" <i>Andy and His Grandmother </i>shows him fighting back against these women, and it can sound as compelling as a car crash.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But it's not all unusually cringe-worthy. There are moments when Kaufman's more lighthearted, '77-era persona shows up, like when he takes his grandmother out for a car ride and tries to convince her that a radar is guiding the vehicle (though that track cannily jump-cuts to a confrontation with a traffic cop who threatens to ""knock the shit"" out of a belligerent Kaufman). And all that phone yelling toward the end of the album is foreshadowed by another phone bit, ""Andy Can Talk to Animals"", where Kaufman gets into a shouting match with what sounds like a squealing pig: ""Yeah, whaddya want? Say it fast."" [pig squeal] ""I had to change my fucking clothes so I can go out and have a good time and you just made me miss my appointment, so <i>fuck you</i>!"" It's funnier than the real arguments-- likely due to the absurdity and lack of actual consequence-- but as Kaufman progressed through the late 70s, coaxing laughs from his audience became less and less of an imperative.</p>
<p class=""p1"">At one point during the album, a wronged woman lashes out at Kaufman in a particularly discombobulated-- but not inaccurate-- manner: ""You think that I really don't know when you goof on me, and you think that I really don't know, and really I know, and you know that I really know, but you say I don't know."" These are the mental hoops this one-of-a-kind performance artist would force people to go through on a regular basis, whether onstage or in front of his tiny personal recorder. It's why he still resonates and fascinates in our world of meta-this and post-that, why anyone would care about a collection of cobbled together personal recordings from an enigma who's been dead for nearly three decades. Based on <i>Andy and His Grandmother, </i>Kaufman comes off like an asshole, a hopelessly naive loser, a crazy person, a hothead, a hopelessly sweet grandma's boy, a sexually confused teenager, and a manipulative monster. In other words, he comes off like Andy Kaufman.</p></div>"|18256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18256-andy-kaufman-andy-and-his-grandmother/|7.2|Ryan Dombal

But fast-forward to 2013 and things look almost entirely different: Baatin and Dilla having passed on in the past half-decade, the core unit carrying on the legacy is T3 (the only founding member remaining), Illa J, and Young RJ.</p>
<p>With just a single original member, it seems wrong call this project Slum Village. Young RJ handled all the production here but none of his beats bring to mind this outfit’s classic material, though a few channel imitation-worthy rap songs from years past: “Scared Money” is heavily percussive like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/960-clipse/"" target=""_blank"">Clipse</a>’s “Grindin’”, “Summer Breeze” is like a modest take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"" target=""_blank"">Nas</a>’ “Summer on Smash”, and “The Line” channels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7749-big-boi/"" target=""_blank"">Big Boi</a>’s booming bro-down “Follow Us”. But when RJ tries to do something new and inventive behind the boards, he doesn't follow through and winds up with something like the minute-long scratch solo that closes “Rock Rock”. Still, RJ produced most of <i>Villa Manifesto</i>, a solid outing for Slum Village in every respect, so it’s unclear why these beats fall so flat compared to the ones he was making just a few years ago.</p>
<p>The current Slum Village lineup has a lot of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15491-black-star/"" target=""_blank"">Black Star</a> in it. That’s not to say SV are trying to define the underground-rap of today like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2838-mos-def/"" target=""_blank"">Mos Def</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2348-talib-kweli/"" target=""_blank"">Talib Kweli</a> did 15 years ago, but the lineage can be heard in these MCs’ interplay, which is one of the few things that they do well together. Unfortunately, with the absence of former Villager Elzhi, who with his 2011 <i>Illmatic </i>tribute proved himself to be the most talented writer ever to hold a full-time position in this group, Slum Village has little to say lyrically. They most often rap about rapping, but when they switch things up, as on the testosterone-infused “Summer Breeze”, the results can be disastrous: “Chest 36C, hips 42/ Can’t blame me for the freaky things I’ll do to you/ Your body’s my Viagara.”</p>
<p>At least that line is delivered with some excitement. Too much else feels like coasting. There’s an unfortunately telling declaration on track eight, “Hustle”: “We don’t talk much, we let our history define us.” Such a policy of terseness was the basis of at least <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly3DZ9QU6hs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one hit rap song in 2012</a>; here, it’s ironic given that these three, as a unit, still have plenty to prove.</p></div>"|18227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18227-slum-village-evolution/|5.5|Mike Madden

It’s a snapshot of a moment when seemingly every emergent indie act was trying to elbow their way into Animal Collective's campfire circle by reverbing their voices into oblivion, duct-taping their guitar pedals down to achieve infinite delay, and locking their rhythms into an epileptic stutter. But as prevalent as that messthetic was, it’s one that has served as a springboard into myriad directions: Doldrums’ recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17646-doldrums-lesser-evil/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lesser Evil</i></a> pumped it up to super-club size; Braids’ upcoming <i>Flourish // Perish</i> chisels it into minimalist electro-prog. Gauntet Hair sees another, possibly more lucrative way forward. Their sophomore effort, <i>Stills</i>, feels less inspired by AnCo's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/"" target=""_blank""><i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i></a> than the actual <a href=""http://www.merriweathermusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Merriweather Post Pavilion</a>: By amplifying the darker undercurrents of their sound and switching on the strobe lights, the Denver-via-Chicago duo sound eager to follow in the footsteps of those 80s goth acts that streamlined their sound and graduated to the summer-amphitheater circuit. </p>
<p>Gauntlet Hair’s sound was always big, it’s just that Andy Rauworth and Craig Nice’s vocals were the smallest things within it, as the duo were content to treat their melodies as ephemeral layers in the miasmic monsoon. <i>Stills</i> immediately issues a corrective: the instantly inviting opener “Human Nature” is a dream retro-dance-night mash-up of INXS’ “The Devil Inside” and the Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Head On”, building up a minimal bass pulse into a heart-racing, clap-clattered rush-- a gradual, ecstatic ascent that mirrors the stirring desire Rauworth openly expresses within. (When he repeats, ad infinitum, “They tell me I make you smile/ one time a week,” it’s with the cool confidence of a guy who presumes that, even with an 86% strike-out rate, he’s still got a crack at the courtship.)</p>
<p>If Gauntlet Hair’s debut sounded like it was recorded at the bottom of a well, “Human Nature” is the geyser that shoots <i>Still</i> above-ground into the great wide open. And, more often than not, Gauntlet Hair successfully answer the challenge of pushing themselves to both more populist and aggressive extremes: “Heave” and “Waste Your Art” are batcave-rockin’ fist-pumpers packed with massive, larynx-shredding choruses that imagine Kurt Cobain dressed up in PVC; “Falling Out” is a robo-rockabilly rave-up that feels like a 21st-century answer to Love &amp; Rockets’ “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQkJrCgl0UA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yin and Yang The Flowerpot Man</a>.” The duo excel at moodier, downtempo material, too: the insidious “Bad Apple” is a smooth mid-80s MOR ballad by way of Wax Trax, and the dubbed-out “G.I.D.” boasts the album’s most sublime sonic flourish, when the song’s elating chorus hook is reprised as a mutant, slowed-down synth line that sounds like a symphony melting into the floor.</p>
<p>It's too bad the duo can’t sustain that sort of boldness over <i>Stills</i>’ entirety, even with a total runtime of just 31 minutes. This is ultimately a transitory record, its gate-crashing momentum tempered by songs that feel like holdovers from Gauntlet Hair’s more whimsical debut. With <i>Stills</i>’ crisper production cleaning up the band’s formative psych-pop splatter, the album’s more sanguine tracks, like the bass-slapping tropical-funk of “Simple” and Panda Bear-hugging “New To It”, come off as plodding and nondescript; what at first seems like an audacious, game-changing record for the band ends up feeling patchy and indecisive. <i>Stills</i>’ most bracing moments show that Rauworth and Nice have their eyes on the prize-- and the stadium back rows-- but their grand visions occassionally get obscured here by navel-gazing regressions. They’ve laid down the gauntlet; they just have to keep trimming the hair.</p></div>"|18271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18271-gauntlet-hair-stills/|6.8|Stuart Berman

First there was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9916-cajun-dance-party/"">Cajun Dance Party</a>, then there was Yuck, then there was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29546-oupa"">Oupa</a>, and now here’s Hebronix-- in the past five years, Blumberg's released widely available records with four different, awkwardly named bands. That takes a lot of commitment and an utter lack of it as well. But while the rambling and roomy songs on <i>Unreal </i>offer Blumberg all the space he wants, it often turns out to be far more than he needs.</p>
<p>In addition to the opening track on <i>Yuck, Unreal </i>recasts that album’s closer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12058-rubber/"">“Rubber”</a>, in a new light; a seven-minute slowcore dirge, “Rubber” smoldered with the speed and intensity of a tire fire. It was an outlier on <i>Yuck </i>and a template here. There are six songs on <i>Unreal </i>and “Rubber” would be the fifth-longest. The initial problem is how this framework can make Blumberg sound more stubborn than ambitious. Opener “Unliving” has some intriguing passages: it begins as a downer solo performance that immediately posits <i>Unreal </i>as a confessional, eventually evolving into a slowly levitating chorus of “ahs.” But they’re splayed about haphazardly and separated by extended subdivisions of laggard drumming and aimless guitar interplay-- it feels like Blumberg started with the goal of making a daunting, 10-minute opener and just worked towards that end. This quality is also shared by its uncompromising and uneventful bookend, “The Plan” which personifies the insularity of its hook (“I’ve got some things to do/ Some private things to do”). In addition to the title of that track, Blumberg’s tastes in frazzled, fuzz-flecked guitar tones will allow comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill"">Built to Spill</a>, another band that’s never shied away from Crazy Horse soloing and marathon track lengths. But where even Doug Martsch’s most labyrinthine studio constructions have a plan, Hebronix can sound fueled by the belief that an eight minute song necessarily grants you twice the ragged glory of one that’s four minutes. </p>
<p>As with most indie artists in the lineage of Neil Young, Blumberg’s proclivity for jangly acoustic/electric jamming can ultimately reveal itself as charming rather than curmudgeonly. <i>Unreal </i>hits a stride during its midsection where “Wild Whim” and the title track strike the right balance of being unforced but not <i>too </i>effortless. They’re every bit as shambling as “Unliving” or “The Plan”, but aren’t meant to convey the idea of Blumberg as a “challenging” artist. “Wild Whim” details a “wild day of sin” but also a solitary one (“There you are on top of him/ Creating situations I’ve never been in”) over an endlessly repeating chord progression, while “Unreal” simply intones “I feel unreal” over and over again until this insouciant state becomes some kind of a stoned reality, a day without clocks where you wake up and just keep going until you shut down. <i>Unreal </i>is a pretty explicit hangover/breakup record, yet “Wild Whim” in particular feels like it’s mining the positive side of those situations, a freedom you get from a sudden a lack of obligation, where you counter the hardships of the previous day by taking back the power and wasting the current one.</p>
<p>It’s easy to draw that conclusion based on the fissuring of Yuck as well as the ramshackle production of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux"">Royal Trux</a>’s Neil Hagerty. A benefit of working with Hagerty is that you appear a little seedier by association and <i>Unreal </i>does come off as decidedly less wholesome than any of Blumberg’s previous work. There was a sweetness and naivety to the heartbreak detailed on <i>Yuck’s </i>“Shook Down” and “Sunday”<i>, </i>whereas here, “Viral” and “Wild Whim” both underline his loneliness with lyrics that make big assumptions about the sex his ex is having elsewhere. Likewise, the rare rhythmic foible or piped-in electronic noise is meant to sound queasy rather than quirky. But you mostly sense Blumberg’s decidedly depressive state in the manner in which <i>Unreal </i>takes its sweet time doing everything. After two minutes of whooshing cello, feedback, and electric piano, “Viral” blooms into <i>Unreal</i>’s most immediately fetching chorus. In fact, it might be the <i>only </i>one. Listening to the sweet co-ed harmonies, the concise and utilitarian lyrics, it stands to reason that Blumberg might feel a little guilty about “Viral”; despite all of his attempts to contort and distend “Viral” during its relatively brief five minutes, you can’t shake how reminiscent it is of Yuck.</p>
<p>It’s an encapsulation of the messy separations that define <i>Unreal. </i>The lyrics talk about disintegrated relationships in the past tense, while the music suggests that while Blumberg has left Yuck, he hasn’t quite <i>quit </i>his last and most successful guise. Blumberg is a capable, if not particularly distinguished guitarist. He is also a songwriter with an unusual gift for sticky, familiar hooks and the issue here is that <i>Unreal </i>puts far more emphasis on the former. On <i>Unreal, </i>Blumberg still can’t get away from himself, he’s just figuring out ways to accept it. </p></div>"|18292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18292-hebronix-unreal/|6.7|Ian Cohen

Aprocryphal Hymns|0.0|Various Artists|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Numero Group']|2013-07-17 00:00:00|2013|2016-06-11 16:55:37.177373|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".i9lyiyhurk.1.6:0.1.0.$18182/=1$18182.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>As made abundantly clear by <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9136-enjoy-the-experience/"">Enjoy the Experience</a></i>, the recent book exploring the world of privately pressed records, there tithings to be had by churches pressing records to sell to their own congregation. Be it in Alabama or Ohio, the covers for these releases were usually interchangeable: the sun setting over a landscape, waves breaking against the rocks, and-- most fitting for the implicit metaphor of New Testament enlightenment conquering darkness-- sunbeams lancing through a cloud.</p>
<p>In the opening notes for Numero Group’s third compilation of gospel music, subtitled <i>Aprocryphal Hymns</i>, they explain that such pastoral landscapes were interchangeable when it came to ordering your very own record sleeves, citing the Century Records Custom Recording Service of Saugus, Calif., in the 1960s and 70s. Gospel acts ranging from the Sensational Friendly Four of Selma, Ala., to the Supreme Jubilees chose their sleeve art dependent on what image seemed most inspirational. Per the Jubilees’ Leonard Sanders: ""When I saw that photo of the sun setting into the ocean, it seemed to express everything we were trying to say.” The Traveling Souls, Song Birds of the South, and Flying Eagle Gospel Singers thought it spoke for them, too.</p>
<p>From such visual clichés come the most intimate of expressions, though, as <i>Aprocryphal Hymns</i> makes clear. Covering the 1960s through the late 70s, <i>Aprocryphal Hymns</i> documents a time of flux for gospel music. Whereas the previous generation caned “Amazing Grace”, soon pop music such as Curtis Mayfield’s “People Get Ready” began to be refigured as praiseworthy fare. Harmonies here draw as much from Philly Soul as they do from Claude Jeter. And with the rise of home studios, what this set compiles is a more personal relationship with God established via magnetic tape.</p>
<p>The hi-hats distort on Robert Vanderbilt &amp; the Foundation of Souls’ “A Message Especially From God”, but its message comes through from syrup-slow flanged guitar and honeyed harmonies. Another deliriously unhurried guitar solo and some fine falsetto praise from the Spiritual Harmonizers puts “God’s Love” somewhere between Mayfield and the Congos. Who knew God was such a 'head for psychedelic music? Elsewhere on this 20-track compilation, the run from Shelton Kilby’s “Poor Wayfaring Stranger” through Jonah Thompson’s wistful “Get Involved” onto the Supreme Jubilees’ “It’ll All Be Over”, is simply sublime. On the latter, end days are rendered into R&amp;B as bittersweet as David Toop’s <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Various-Sugar-And-Poison/release/528218"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Sugar &amp; Poison</i></a> set.</p>
<p>There are more than a few attempts at the Delfonics’ “La-La (Means I Love You)” beat, while on Dwain Vinyard’s “Searching for the Truth” the break verges on turning into “Les Fleurs”, but for the most part, the rhythms here involve man imitating machine. Snare patterns rarely budge beyond the pitter-patter of early rhythm acers like Sly Stone and Shuggie Otis. Only Otis G. Johnson’s skeletal-soul perambulation of “Walk With Jesus” uses an actual drum machine though, one from a retrofitted Hammond B-3, with Johnson’s Ford Motor Plant skills used to tweak the machine’s inner rhythms. And much like the way in which Sly Stone used such a metronome on 1971’s <i>There’s a Riot Goin’ On</i>, the pulse here acts as a beacon through the haze.</p></div>"|18182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18182-good-god-aprocryphal-hymns/|7.5|Andy Beta

The word gets thrown around a lot, especially regarding to their debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13101-1-record-radio-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>#1 Record</i></a>, as if perfection were their triumph. They were a band of few, if any triumphs; theirs was a losers' history upgraded by the passage of time and the success of those they influenced. Big Star were marked by their <i>lack</i> of triumph. Big Star were roiling and volatile, a freak collision between a couple of college kids and an idle teen idol, who in every regard but artistic, failed their way through a career that barely qualified as such. How far Big Star fell into that wide chasm between what they wanted to be and what they were, <i>that</i> is what made them great.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Nothing Can Hurt Me</i> is the soundtrack for the new Big Star documentary of the same name. It contains unheard, alternate mixes from <i>#1 Record</i>, rough mixes from <i>Sister Lovers</i>, and other special mixes created for the movie, all bracketed by studio banter. They don't shine like the original album versions, but still, ""When My Baby's Beside Me"" is just as compelling even if this mix has more pish in the cymbals. You would have to be at least a six-out-of-10 on the Big Star nerd scale to hear specific differences without cuing up a Big Star album proper to check. </p>
<p class=""p1"">During the time of these recordings, Alex Chilton was only a few years past ""The Letter"", the single that made him a teenage star with the Box Tops. The single had sold four million copies and nabbed them a Grammy nomination alongside the Beatles. (That they both lost to 5th Dimension explains the dimensions of entire pop cosmos at the time). Over the next few years he saw enough of success to know he didn't want it on its terms; he dropped from the limelight, bailed on his life in Memphis with his teenage bride and newborn son, hung heavy with the Beach Boys in L.A. before he expatriated to the Village at 19 to fashion himself into a folkie. Embarrassed by the Box Tops, he was aiming to do something earnest. Two years later he returned to Memphis with a couple of songs and essentially stumbled into Chris Bell's laborious studio project with bassist Andy Hummel and drummer Jody Stephens. With the addition of Chilton, they became Big Star. </p>
<p class=""p1"">If nothing else, <i>Nothing Can Hurt Me</i> functions as a will-do-in-a-pinch Big Star Best Of. You get a sort of thumbnail genesis, but without the movie to provide context, it's jarring to go from Chilton's ode to the purity of the teenage love, ""Thirteen"", with its fragile harmonies and ""tickets for the dance,"" to a markedly less lucid Chilton droning, ""Nothing can hurt me... I can't feel a thing"" five songs later. On ""Thirteen"", and the songs that precede it, they sounded like what they were: American kids who grew up on the Beatles. Once you get to the brittle distance of ""Kanga Roo"" and its peals of feedback, there is a sad, reedy quality to Chilton's voice. It's clearly the same repentant boy of ""Give Me Another Chance"", but on ""Kangaroo"", his wavering, narcotized tone makes it seem like he's melting; his promise that ""I'm gonna be alright now,"" ringing hollow as he sounds anything but.   </p>
<p class=""p1"">Chris Bell, as the saying goes, was perhaps just not made for his times. Born into affluence, he was private and volatile--during Big Star's era he secluded himself in the back house behind his parents home, where he immersed himself in making art and music and taking drugs in an attempt to salve his depression and blunt his sexuality (in the film, his brother says Bell confessed as much-- in the American South in the early 70s, even amid the youth culture fringe, being queer was not really spoken of. Even in the documentary, some of Bell's friends speak of it euphemistically as ""experimentation"". Many of the doc's tearjerking moments are for Bell). You can hear Bell's Beatlesmania in his voice here on ""My Life Is Right"", in his crisply un-American o's of the ""lonely road"" he sings of. There's a quiver in his voice on ""Feel"", a squeaky stretch as he forces his high notes; along with the surly bravado he summons on ""Don't Lie to Me,""--""I told my dad/ And now I'm telling you/ Don't push me 'round,"" he yalps--you hear the proximity to boyhood. That for all their finesse, for all of these gorgeously arranged songs and year of Bell-helmed sessions at Ardent-- they were still amateurs getting it right; kids in a good time band. </p>
<p class=""p1"">What the sad documentary and its accompanying soundtrack of barely alternate-mixes reinforce is that there is no justice in pop music; the ones that ""deserve"" to make it rarely do, dreams die on the vine.  Big Star's fame, during their initial three-album run, was directly inverse to their talent. Rock'n'roll is cruel like that; it's all winners histories and idiot luck. Music might have been a different place if <i>#1 Record</i> had been just that and bumped Jethro Tull's <i>Thick as a Brick</i> off the charts in June of 1972, but maybe not. There are plenty of bands that mapped inspired paths to greatness, but Big Star's story, as seen on film and heard on these songs, is a potent reminder of just how beautiful failure can be.</p></div>"|18212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18212-big-star-nothing-can-hurt-me/|8.0|Jessica Hopper

Fortunately, Cedermark plays up the existential and philosophical issues that make “home” one of the most powerful and commonplace concepts in pop music. Even the quaint abode on its cover allows you to project your fears and ambitions onto it. If you’re thinking about starting a family one day, do you see conformity or comfort? If you’re an apartment dweller in a crowded metro area, do you see isolation or privacy?</p>
<p>There’s enough space to consider all of the above on <i>Home Life, </i>though Cedermark leans towards the latter of both those binaries. If there was ever an album that sounds like it was made to be listened to on the Saturdays when you’re in your boxers, easing out of your hangover with a noon beer, <i>Home Life </i>is it. Opener “On Me” welcomes the couch-bound and queasy by sending up <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPoTGyWT0Cg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bill Withers</a> with a simultaneous celebration and lament of dollar beer night, helping frame <i>Home Life </i>as relatable and grounded-- typically, an honest day’s work causes the people here to head out to bars and the next day’s work is the reason they have to call for their tab and a cab.</p>
<p>At the risk of projecting, both Cedermark and I resided in Charlottesville, Va., during our early 20s and though most of <i>Home Life </i>was recorded in upstate New York and New Jersey, it sounds like it’s fueled by memories of the Southern college town that Dave Matthews, Stephen Malkmus, and David Berman also once called home. There’s a shuffling, country pace to these songs and Cedermark’s droopy, drawled vocals evince a boozy bonhomie that you don’t hear too often north of the Mason-Dixon. The <i>sound </i>of <i>Home Life </i>is pure indie rock, though, produced by Kevin McMahon (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14010-the-monitor/"">The Monitor</a>, </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"">Real Estate</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15918-days""><i>Days</i></a>) with holistic intimacy; compared to the sizzling fuzz of Cedermark’s 2010 debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14628-moon-deluxe/"">Moon Deluxe</a>, </i>this is a warm recording<i>,</i> capturing a couple of musicians in<i> </i>one room with limited pruning and letting the instruments bleed into each other. Stinging, lyrical guitar leads and Cedemark’s vocals weave together throughout, which can be something of a drawback. Though Cedermark made the lyrics available on his <a href=""http://andrewcedermark.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blogspot</a>, they can easily fade towards the background and give you the false impression that <i>Home Life </i>is meant to be a bashful work.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Cedermark’s lyrics on <i>Home Life </i>are well worth considering.<i> </i>Without getting too specific about geography or personal detail, its perspective is one of post-collegiate anxiety, a point where Cedermark is either worrying about the future, stuck on the past and, as a result, not really living in the moment as much as he could. A lot of <i>Home Life </i>is viewed from passing trains, most pointedly “Train Window Man”, where he tries to think of a way to describe the trees and piled-up beer cans he sees during his commute. He can’t come up with anything besides “sad,” which becomes its own form of sadness.</p>
<p>Most often, <i>Home Life </i>theorizes on how old friendships can endure and new ones can start when people are no longer in close quarters and bar nights become fewer and further between.  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15313-canis-major/"">“Canis Major”</a> scans as a love song, albeit one concerned with how to get over yourself enough to love someone else, either romantically or platonically. He sighs, “My girl/ Chest heaves as she dreams/ Oh how I love her with my cicada-shell heart/ Sometimes I need you/ but I don’t know how to get there,” and it’s a deadpan moment of ridiculousness. He’s aware of his need for companionship, yet can’t communicate them to the person who is right there in his bed. On the subsequent “Canis Minor”, love is viewed with trippy logic as part divine intervention and cosmic joke, no less random than connecting two stars in the shape of a dog.</p>
<p>But while Cedermark is an ace guitarist and affecting lyricist, his songwriting isn’t quite as rigorous or sharp. The preworn familiarity of “On Me” makes it the standout by default, and it’s also the most memorable song by a fair margin. Though his former bandmate Patrick Stickles is an equally wordy lyricist, he typically writes melodies that are sturdy enough to handle the cramped verbiage. Conversely, Cedermark’s tend to follow the ambling path of his plainspoken prose. There are exceptions; the up-tempo surge of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15502-andrew-cedermark-at-home/"">“At Home”</a> is a welcome eye-opener while “Come Back” provides contrast with a solo performance that lets Cedermark air his doubts about his artistic process. It’s a self-aware moment on a self-aware record, though he’d be served well going a little further to connect with those who aren’t in the specific vibe that <i>Home Life </i>nails. Cedermark laments in “On Me” that “I've got a beer and nobody to lean on,” and if you’re a little nostalgic, a little tipsy and feeling pretty OK with all of that, <i>Home Life </i>is there when you need a hand. </p></div>"|18274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18274-andrew-cedermark-home-life/|7.2|Ian Cohen

Half her time's spent on careful precision production; the other half, the straightforward melodies and plainspoken lyrics you’d find in more outward-facing dance or R&amp;B. As such, she makes two types of songs: meticulous vocalises that seem hookier than their short length would allow, and more fully-formed <i>songs</i> with melodies and subject matter that wouldn’t be out of place on a 90s R&amp;B crossover-- maybe it was done by Timbaland at his pre-<i>Shock Value </i>loopiest. (For an example, see Kmeto’s tense cover of Brandy’s “I Wanna Be Down.”) Kmeto has company in this, especially lately, and she’s often brought up alongside vocalist-producers like Maya Jane Coles, Grimes, and Jessie Ware, <a href=""http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2013/04/ladies-mic-maya-jane-coles-nina"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sometimes on dubious gender grounds</a>. Arguably, she has equal affinity with James Blake or How to Dress Well, artists who share similar ideas about space and moodiness, or Disclosure, who’ve fielded <a href=""http://www.dummymag.com/features/2013/05/24/disclosure-interview-we-ve-always-written-pop-songs/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the same questions</a> about composing for vocals. <i>Crisis</i>, her proper full-length debut, has plenty of both, but also-- unlike her half-flirting with trap on this year’s <i>Dirty Mind Melt </i>EP, or the deconstructed snippets of ideas scattered throughout her last albums-- a new sense of urgency.</p>
<p>For one, <i>Crisis </i>has got something that’s eluded Kmeto thus far: a massive single. You can see the stock parts in “Idiot Proof”, the sequencer octaves and skittery percussion, the piano chasing glassy voice down the scale, the chorus that kicks up about three times the storm of anything else surrounding, but it’s <i>authoritative</i> in a way that’s new for her. There’s another, too. “Last Time” presses against a synth slab long enough to highlight how little <i>motion </i>the track’s got-- an apt analogue to the sorta-on, sorta-off relationship described. The quieter cuts have their charms, too. “Morning Sex” is far more unmoored and resigned than the blunt title suggests; it provides its own soft focus. “Vodka Diet” is like a callback to <i>The Ache</i>’s “Detox Saturday”, another hungover hallucination with synth claps, vague trap rhythms, and half-distorted vocals submerged in the fog. The album closes with a three-track suite that sheds progressively more production frippery (thrilling as it is) to great effect, until closer “Prideless” is almost a cappella over snaps and a simple riff. It’s like an early Ashanti track submerged underwater, and just because that’s right off the alt-R&amp;B pantheon of ideals doesn’t make it any less delicately compelling.</p>
<p>Though “delicate” may not be the best word for <i>Crisis. </i>Kmeto’s said that <i>Crisis </i>is her <a href=""http://rookiemag.com/2013/06/natasha-kmeto/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“straightforward, cathartic” album</a>, and while that’s often interview-speak for “album with broader ambitions than the old stuff,” there’s something to it. Just look at the song titles-- the middle stretch in particular comes off like a drugged-out portion of <a href=""http://therumpus.net/2011/12/the-rumpus-book-club-interviews-laurie-weeks/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Laurie Weeks book</a>-- or what they’re saying. “Idiot Proof” is one big protest-- “it’s been a while, I need peace from all the things I’m supposed to be”; the weighty synths punctuating the words as much as Kmeto’s voice, torchy all of a sudden. It’s a little strange at first that such millennialisms are as poppy a prospect as the crashing rhythm, but it’s 2013 and here we are. If “Last Time” is like something out of a mumblecore sitcom, come-on “Take Out” is the party episode: beginning brash, as if Kmeto’s strutting in front of a mirror, it bursts with extra vocal tracks and laser zaps and synths like confetti. Moments like these are, at times, more effective hooks into the album than the actual hooks, or Kmeto’s 90s vocals, for all their perfectly timed retromania. Anyone can get all Aaliyah over Ableton. Where Kmeto shines as a songwriter/producer isn’t simply mashing together trends and skillsets, but finding that emotional entry point.</p></div>"|18223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18223-natasha-kmeto-crisis/|6.8|Katherine St. Asaph

It’s easy to see the appeal, as the inherent limitations of this setup can inspire bands to push themselves in ways that power trios might not-- in the case of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids"">Japandroids</a>, stripping to the barest instrumentation allows the most direct connection to the audience, whereas <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5313-no-age"">No Age</a> attempt to uncover the maximum textural possibilities within their boundaries. A band like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5680-the-dodos"">Dodos</a> focuses on the rhythmic qualities of acoustic instruments, while the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys"">Black Keys</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes"">White Stripes</a> subvert roots music with their respective idiosyncrasies. Manchester duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31400-ghost-outfit"">Ghost Outfit</a> do a number of those things for brief periods of time on their debut <i>I Want You to Destroy Me</i>. But they're also a reminder that playing as a duo can simplify things beyond an economic and touring perspective; having only one other guy to bounce ideas off can result in taking the artistic path of least resistance as well.</p>
<p>It’s no slight to say Ghost Outfit come off as energetic performers more than adroit craftsmen at this point. Opener “Too Soon” is played like they have two minutes tops to hold your attention, a 6/8 churn of pounding toms, guitars fuzzed beyond recognition, and Jack Hardman's yelped vocals. It’s the sound of a band that’s struggled through basement shows and crap PAs in order to be heard; Ghost Outfit is the opening act that actually moved you when you were just expecting to kill time before the headliner. Throughout, Ghost Outfit<i> </i>sound like they’d be a blast live, especially with the visual element implied by Michael Benson's prodding drumwork and Hardman's neck-straining.</p>
<p>But at the risk of stating the obvious, you’re not in the same room as Ghost Outfit during <i>I Want You to Destroy Me</i>. The downside of this formalist, reverential sound is that Ghost Outfit trigger just as many memories of specific bands rather than bespoke emotions without giving much sense of why you’d gravitate to Ghost Outfit in particular. When the tempos and vocals calm down during the mid-album valley of “Sleep” and “Words”, they become yawning Echo and the Mary Chain narco-pop that will get jumbled with the last <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27783-crocodiles"">Crocodiles</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30471-stagnant-pools"">Stagnant Pools</a> song you heard. While “Lexicon” stands out in context for its pitch-shifted guitars and erratic, phonetic vocals, it’s ground that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28763-gauntlet-hair"">Gauntlet Hair</a> have covered more comprehensively. Interludes of droning guitar try to create a sense of continuity to <i>I Want You to Destroy Me</i>, but it all seems perfunctory; you wonder if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter"">Deerhunter</a>'s enduring contribution to indie rock will be the idea that one-minute interstitials are a requirement for any up-and-coming noise-pop band.</p>
<p><i>I Want You to Destroy Me </i>is solid as far as debuts go, though it offers the all-too-common letdown of hearing music that’s superficially loud and aggressive, yet feels like it’s doing so little to actually stand out. Ghost Outfit occasionally find ways to do so-- as opposed to most vocalists working within endless tides of sustained, distorted guitars, Hardman's excitable presence lends a welcome burst of reckless energy. It finally perks up for the promising closer, “Kids”, an unabashed crowd pleaser with count-off vocals and start-stop dynamics, tricks that have sustained energetic, if not overly distinct debuts for time immemorial. But for Ghost Outfit, it’s important because it’s the first time where it finally feels like more than two people are in the room on <i>I Want You to Destroy Me</i>.</p></div>"|18199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18199-ghost-outfit-i-want-you-to-destroy-me/|6.4|Ian Cohen

They’ve released compilations that showcase particular styles from acid house to country soul alongside an increasing number of books on music-related topics from Haiti’s Kanaval to New York’s ball culture to the rise of electronic dancehall in Jamaica. As it stands, much of what Soul Jazz has done is chart narratives and tell stories as much as they showcase music. <i>Mirror to the Soul </i>brings together music, film, and writing to provide a perspective on the Caribbean-- particularly the postcolonial era.  </p>
<p>The compilation is part of the package and acts as soundtrack to a two-hour documentary film made up entirely of clips from the archive of <a href=""http://www.britishpathe.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">British Pathé</a>-- the company that produced newsreels for cinema-goers in the UK from 1920 to 1970. It’s tough to visit the Pathé website and not end up pleasantly trapped in an abyss of newsreel goodness. Label head Stuart Baker meandered through the Caribbean clips and with the eyes and ears of a DJ-- the film moves back and forth between places and times-- and painted a portrait of mid-20th-century West Indian life as seen through the eyes of the empire. An uncomfortable, insightful and surprising, as well as eye opening film, the accompanying compilation provides another element of the place that is the Caribbean. And this is a place that is not normally considered all together. </p>
<p>Especially where music is concerned, the Caribbean is rarely viewed as a region. The archipelago that stretches from Belize across to Cuba-- the so-called “greater” Antilles-- down to Guyana are “seeds of islands dispersed by the winds” as Nobel-winning St Lucian Derek Walcott would say. And though the promotion of all-inclusive resort travel may have narrowed the definition of these disparate places to a series of warm and relaxing beach destinations, the range of culture and identity is, in actuality, incredibly wide. Sure, the world listens to reggae, but beyond that, though Guadeloupans might listen to Haitian konpa, it’s more than tough to find, say, a dancehall in Jamaica that would be rocking reggaeton. Language tends to divide West Indian music into sections-- calypso, soca, reggae and dancehall; konpa, zouk and soukous; cha cha, salsa and merengue, to name but a few. Though one might assume that any linguistic disconnect might be lessened by the interconnectedness made possible by the internet, listening to the radio in the region demonstrates that lines are indeed drawn. </p>
<p>With <i>Mirror to the Soul</i>, listeners<i> </i>are provided with a view on the Caribbean that encourages cultural links and connections, reaching back to the 1960s and 70s. Listening to the compilation from beginning to end, there’s certainly a regional obsession with creating tunes that do well on a dancefloor. It also demonstrates the perspective of this area of the world during the era of independence for many of these islands. Through culture, immigration, and communication, the Caribbean integrated numerous musical influences. It’s perhaps why the music works so well together. To call the accompanying booklet ""liner notes"" is a bit of an understatement. Seventy-five pages not only describe the tunes, but tell the history of the period.  </p>
<p>The set kicks off with Andre Toussaint’s “Nassau Cha Cha”, a recording that seems to do a good job of setting the tone for this collection-- a two-minute mash up of jazz and cha cha, sang by a scatting Haitian with a band featuring a flautist trained at Jamaica’s world-famous <a href=""http://www.alphaboysschool.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alpha Boys School</a>. The connection between the English, Spanish and French Caribbean is represented in this track-- a connection that isn’t often made.</p>
<p>There are some highlights here-- like Trinidadian Edmondo Ros “London Is the Place for Me”, which sounds like a soundtrack to Sam Selvon’s classic book about West Indian experience in the UK, <i>Lonely Londoners</i>. It also demonstrates the Caribbean connection to the UK through the generation of immigrants that travelled on the Empire Windrush to find their fortunes on the challenging and often discriminatory shores of the mother country. Russ Henderson’s jazzy “West Indian Drums”, recorded in England in the late 1950s, is another example of a piece that reaches from the West Indies across the ocean. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The Cuban selections are particularly good, with examples from before and after the revolution. “Mambo Caliente” by Bebo Valdes and his Havana Allstars is a peek into Havana’s famous <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropicana_Club"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tropicana nightclub</a> in the early 1950s. Reaching forward to 1976, Grupo de Experimentación Sonora del Icaic’s odd “Repentino” is a standout. But this isn't really about picking out the best tracks-- in fact, fans of Soul Jazz releases will probably recognize quite a few of the bits and pieces gathered together here. This is more about curation than it is about crate digging. Moving from the groove of “Calypso Invasion” of the Trinidadian Duke of Iron to the infectious “Baila Mi Shingaling” by Puerto Rico’s El Gran Combo to the gorgeous, shimmering rocksteady of Slim Smith’s classic “My Conversation” is hearing different musics from different places talk to each other. As Smith puts it, “all I need from you is a good conversation, because it gives me sweet inspiration.” </p>
<p>Providing further context is a bonus CD of 15 roots music tracks. Reaching back over the past couple of decades that Soul Jazz has spent recording Afro-Caribbean music, this selection features some new bits and some previously released gems. There’s Haitian <i>rara-- </i>carnival marching music complete with horns, drums and shouts, Gwada (Guadeloupan) <i>gwo-ka </i>drumming, a range of Garifuna music from Belize, and further roots styles from Cuba. Listening to this CD alongside the music from the mid-century Caribbean draws further rhythmic connections between islands and cultures. </p>
<p>This is not a comprehensive collection, and aficionados of some of the styles and genres will not find a trove of undiscovered treasure. But that’s really not the point. Much like the accompanying documentary, with it’s non-linear presentation of the Pathé clips, listening to <i>Mirror to the Soul</i> is about a particular period and set of places. It’s about listening to music as a means of encapsulating an experience, about framing the Caribbean in a different way, and for that reason it’s a worthwhile project. </p></div>"|18291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18291-mirror-to-the-soul-in-the-caribbean-1920-72/|7.0|Erin MacLeod

The artwork for each installment was the same: an image of a monstrous rage-filled creature who only looked a little bit like a dog, tied in a yard outside and open window. Dialog bubbles from inside the house would offer a punning exchange or some philosophical point that was twisted into a single goofy joke (<a href=""http://www.lynchnet.com/angrydog/dog10.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this one</a> was typical: “Pete has a police record”/ “What does he have a police record for?”/ “I guess he likes Sting and their music.”) If you were tuned into Lynch’s surreal sense of humor, there was something compelling about this relentless devotion to a single idea. <i>Angriest Dog</i> ran for nine years.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For Lynch, revisiting obsessions over and over is part of the deal. His second solo album, <i>The Big Dream</i>, which follows on 2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15999-david-lynch-crazy-clown-time/"">Crazy Clown Time</a></i>, is another example. It feels very much like a continuation of its predecessor, with the same weaknesses and strengths. Once again, Lynch takes musical elements from his youth-- the sock-hop ballads of Bobby Vinton, the gnarled guitar instruments of Link Wray, both of which are common in his films-- and gives them a modern but still homemade sheen, topping the reverb-heavy dreaminess of the music with half-sung lyrics in Lynch’s distinctively nasally register. The imagery is archetypical: cold winds blow, it’s last call, there’s a wishing well. It is, in other words, another album of Lynch shuffling his iconic imagery and rendering it in another form of media, in this case an album.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The strengths? Lynch has a deep understanding of song and mood. Though he’s not a musician, exactly, he’s been working in a studio with composer Angelo Badalamenti, sound designer Alan Splet, and others for going on 40 years. He knows how sound works and the kinds of emotional responses it can generate. So the fat low-end and ringing twang of “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tTDxSdudNM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Star Dream Girl</a>” put you into a very specific headspace within about five seconds, and the vaporous guitar tone and slow-dance sway of “Cold Wind Blowin’” generate a palpable ache, even if the song itself doesn’t necessarily stand up to heavy scrutiny. You get a sense that, given Lynch’s interests and the tools available to him, <i>The Big Dream</i> is probably a well-rendered version of what he might have had in his head, the album that he wanted to make.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The main weakness is the same one found on <i>Crazy Clown Time</i>: the songs. As songs, they don’t do much or say much. There are no new wrinkles, no moments of surprise or recognition. It hints at fear and creepiness and dreaminess without ever embodying them. The main appeal of the record is that it’s “an album by David Lynch”. It’s hard to hear the album without thinking first “I’m listening to a David Lynch album” rather than “I’m listening to music” or “I’m listening to a song.” In other words, without intimate knowledge of Lynch’s aesthetic, place in culture, and oeuvre, the album doesn’t have much to offer. (The big exception once again is a song sung by someone else-- Lykke Li’s lead vocal turn on the “digital bonus track” “I'm Waiting Here”; hearing it, it’s hard not to wish very badly that Lynch would have gotten others to sing the rest of the album). As such, it’s difficult to imagine returning to this album months or even weeks from now, once the initial charge of “I’m listening to a David Lynch album” has worn off. </p>
<p class=""p1"">That might sound like a harsh criticism, but it really isn’t. Lynch as an artist and an icon has earned some latitude, and following along with his projects has proven to be an enjoyable activity in its own right as we wait for him to catch another big fish and make another film. But when we look back at his great body of work years hence, I suspect that this pair of albums-- unlike, say, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16948-eraserhead/""><i>Eraserhead </i>soundtrack</a> or the Julee Cruise album <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_into_the_Night"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Floating Into the Night</i></a>-- will be considered minor diversions, something more on the level of <i>The Angriest Dog in the World</i>, a collection of Lynch-isms stretched to a point where they are of interest to only his most committed fans.</p></div>"|18275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18275-david-lynch-the-big-dream/|6.3|Mark Richardson

On May 4, 1970, a student demonstration protesting President Nixon’s recently announced expansion of the Vietnam War (deemed the Cambodian Campaign) at Kent State University turned deadly, the National Guard opening fire on unarmed students, killing four, wounding nine others, and permanently paralyzing another. It was an ugly moment in U.S. history and a profound one for Casale. “I saw exit wounds from M1 rifles out of the backs of two of the four people who were killed, Jeffrey Miller and Allison Krause, [who] were my friends,” he <a href=""http://vermontreview.tripod.com/Interviews/devo.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> one interviewer. “Until then I was a hippie.

<p>Perversely out of print for over twenty years, <i>Hardcore Devo</i> now gets a CD and LP reissue. (Lamentably, the vinyl reissues arrived in shops the same week that news came down that Myers, deemed ""the human metronome"" by bandmates during his decade-long tenure in the group, had lost his battle to cancer.) Recorded to four-track at their basement space from 1974-1977, the forty demos presented here reveal Devo to be abrasive, twisted, paranoid, primal, and sexually frustrated, robotic in a way far more disconcerting than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a> could ever manage. It revealed a band more demented and trenchant than had ever been glimpsed on MTV. On one sleeve, they are beaver-watchers wrapped in rubber, stacked as corpses. In another, they are adorned with rubber tits. Only “Mongoloid” and “Jocko Homo” made it to those Eno sessions at Conny Plank’s recording studio in Germany, as well as covers of the Stones and Allen Toussaint’s “Working in a Coal Mine”. </p>
<p>While scrubbed from all later versions of Devo’s doctrine, “de-evolution” also meant regressing from adulthood back to pre-pubescence, far from political correctness or polite company, to considering women only as alien apparatuses. They’re tomatoes, holes, a biological urge, a commodity for rich business men who want “but one taste of [their] toilet water,” something to tie a rope around like a horse. There’s commentary on marriage to be had in “The Rope Song”, but amid the queasy Moog, there’s still that ring-modulated voice saying: “She runs away but not very far/ Push a button, retractable cord/ I pull her back when I get bored.” Less creative: “I need a bitch to suck my dick.” Some lines vie for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus</i></a>-level trolling: “A slant-eyed catfish that tasted better than Mom,” on post-Vietnam War “Bamboo Bimbo”, and pining for “buttered beauties of the negroid” just after an era of civil rights marches.</p>
<p>Most acutely felt on the far weirder id- and Moog-blats of <i>Vol. 2</i>, the aforementioned lyrical themes border on something like a psychiatrist’s notes on a frequent teen masturbator. They don’t get a free pass, but considering how many times incest also crops up (see the disco moves of “Midget”), it feels like an unfiltered spleening of sexual anger and frustration. There are also odes to being a mongoloid, to the cognitively impaired, to pinheads.

<p>The last EP was inspired by the music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Philip Glass</a> and Yellow Magic Orchestra's Ryuichi Sakamoto, and more amorphously, from the brutalist architecture of the 1960s. <i>Music for Objects</i>, as the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Eno</a>-esque title would suggest, subscribes to a similar kind of intellectual curiosity that informed the previous release (this record aims to depict normal, unimpressive things Silver encounters every day), but it isn't a purely eggheaded endeavor. Instead, Silver is able to evoke wide arrays of emotion with mere keystrokes. And while <i>Music for Objects</i> doesn't strictly adhere to ""sounding"" like the objects examined here-- ""Keys"", ""Lamp"", ""Bowl""-- he brings things to life in ways that wouldn't feel unfamiliar to OCD sufferers quick to anthropomorphize objects lying around the apartment. But with CFCF, the less literal the better, as the real payoff is experiencing these things from Silver's point of view, with surprisingly moving results.</p>
<p>Despite recently taking cues from tangible items, CFCF's music has always seemed informed by the seasons, like the bone-cold late winter feel of <i>Exercises</i>, which in some ways gives way to the new growth of springtime that <i>Music for Objects</i> inhabits. From the dewy serenity of ""Bowl"", with its pan flutes and sparse keys, to the shyly sexy saxophone and drain spout plunks of ""Camera"", to ""Glass""'s nimbleness and shimmer, all of it suggests something of a rebirth. The same could be said for Silver, who has found new but sure footing with these complimentary EPs. Just as with <i>Exercises</i>, <i>Music for Objects</i> finds CFCF becoming less of a producer and more of a composer, using more traditional instruments (sax, piano, marimba) to delicately layer and build with. These works are far less busy than the neon-streaked, movement-minded tracks that described his earlier work, but are just as capable of soundtracking some pretty impressive eyelid movies.</p>
<p><i>Music for Objects</i> came to life after Silver watched 1989's <a href=""http://www.wim-wenders.com/movies/movies_spec/notebookoncitiesandclothes/notebookoncitiesandclothes.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Notebook on Cities and Clothes</i></a>, a documentary by Wim Wenders on fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto. Silver was particularly struck by the challenge faced by Laurent Petitgand, the film's composer, regarding having to construct a piece of music that expressed something about a piece of clothing. Following in Petitgand's footsteps, Silver has uncovered a good deal more than a project of this nature might reveal, as viewing <i>Music for Objects</i> as merely a functional piece of work is to ignore how emotionally impacting it truly is, no matter what is being depicted. In reinterpreting Petitgand's task, Silver is often able to get a decent amount of mileage out of more concrete depictions of his objects.</p>
<p>It's hard not to hear the romance in something like ""Perfume"" or ""Ring"", the closing piano suite that feels eternal in its simplicity. ""Turnstile"" is even more effective, with its bright pastels and bell tones suggesting a time-lapse video of a Tokyo street during rush hour. The rest of these tracks require a little more effort to unpack-- it's not hard to conjure images of light being refracted off of ""Glass"", or feel the rounded edges of ""Bowl"", but they don't come as quickly or easily. But <i>Music for Objects</i> is, above all else, a record about perspective, one that requires you to look at the familiar from a different angle, and in doing so do the most impressive illuminations take place. The playful tug of war on display on ""Lamp"" doesn't trace a common shape, but sharing a corner of Silver's headspace for a little while is more than half the fun.</p>
<p>But the finest moment on <i>Music for Objects</i> has to be ""Keys"", which is strange because it's probably the least indicative of the EP as a whole. Carrying the saxophone over from ""Camera"", it's a humid, almost danceable track that jams in classic house-y pianos, chirping cicadas, and a dizzying little free jazz coda. It ends up sounding like Bruce Hornsby melting into a swamp. But while ""Keys"" may not be the clearest statement of purpose here, it says something larger about CFCF, offering a condensation of the best bits of Silver's personality, a measured mix of the old and the new all wrapped up into one beatific little four minute segment. It also hints at even greater potential: While it's obvious that Silver isn't the least bit interested in following any set of prescribed rules, the vision of a more complete, multi-faceted CFCF becomes easier to make out. But it's obvious that these smaller steps have all been necessary ones, and wherever he takes his music in the future, there will be plenty to be excited about. But on the subject of <i>Music for Objects</i> alone, it's another excellent chapter in CFCF's story, a strong case for how much unexpected magic can be found in the ordinary and, more importantly, in CFCF's ever-mutating discography.</p></div>"|18281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18281-cfcf-music-for-objects-ep/|7.3|Zach Kelly

Moe is only 19 years old, and he looks even younger than that, but his hoarse, cracked voice, infused with preternatural weariness and reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game/"" target=""_blank"">the Game</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30225-yo-gotti/"" target=""_blank"">Yo Gotti</a>, makes him sound decades older. Moe raps with a panicked urgency, hurrying through his wordy, packed verses like he's stopping a loved one from walking away from him.</p>
<p>His writing is similarly blunt and direct: The first <i>Humble Hustle</i>, released when Moe was 17, included a disarmingly direct version of the older-then-the-hills gangsta-rap trope, the ""letter to my mother,"" and <i>Humble Hustle 2</i> starts out with an even sweeter and unaffected message to his son. ""I used to drive for hours just to see you for 30 minutes,"" he says on ""Letter 2 Amarie"", reflecting on his own absentee father and concluding thoughtfully: ""I'm guessing I love you more than he loved me."" It's a powerful, sad insight, and Moe has the intuition not to underline it. It's just there, along with the rest of his life. </p>
<p><i>Humble Hustle 2</i> glows with this understated honesty; at 19 tracks, it is a generous and sometimes daunting platter of heartfelt, serious, and finely observed struggle-rap. What it isn't, really, is flashy or stylish or that much fun, which makes Moe's loyal fanbase in local middle schools-- cultivated, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"" target=""_blank"">Chief Keef</a>-style, by handing out mixtapes to kids-- somewhat surprising. Keef, who is a vocal fan of Moe's, turns up once on <i>Humble Hustle 2</i>, for the intense, blaring ""Round Em Up"", a song that seems to be built from two non-compatible beats playing over each other, but Moe is not the dead-eyed presence that Keef is. Moe traffics in the human-sized blue-collar weariness of Chicago's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31352-tree/"" target=""_blank"">Tree</a>, or Nashville's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30125-starlito/"" target=""_blank"">Starlito</a> and Memphis' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30124-don-trip/"" target=""_blank"">Don Trip</a>. Maybe kids see Moe as a sage older brother figure; maybe they crave a sound moral compass as much as they enjoy violent escape. Maybe they just like Moe.</p>
<p>Either way, <i>Humble Hustle 2</i> boasts some of the year's wisest and most soulful grown-man music, delivered by a relative kid. His soulful openness seems to open up others around him; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5547-freeway/"" target=""_blank"">Freeway</a> appears on ""Dreamin"" with his best-written verse in a few years, a recollection of his grandfather's struggles with alcoholism. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29863-fat-trel/"" target=""_blank"">Fat Trel</a> also shows up twice, unfolding rich crime-story details on ""Million Dollar Dreams"" and delivering lip-licking, snaggle-toothed sex talk on ""Gettin It All"". It's to Moe's credit as a rapper that he remains the most vivid presence on his mixtape, even with his colorful guests.</p>
<p>Moe raps like a pugilist, his voice plowing doggedly into each beat and his rhyme schemes piling like pack crates on a pallet. On the story-rap ""T.I.N.O."", his forceful raps are dotted with writerly grace notes: ""Rang six times and he picked up on the last""; ""So he told him the sour and the powder was on the counter."" At the song's climax, he demands, ""What you do when you momma need her medicine, the devil at the door and he beggin' you to let him in?"" It's an old gangsta-rap question-- the oldest-- but he rattles you with it. On the ""Outro"", he tells us, charmingly, that he feels like ""the principal over the intercom"" and then delivers an entire verse alternating between English and Arabic (the ""Moe"" is short for ""Mohammed"", and the rapper is Egyptian-born).</p>
<p>There are some audible marks of the project's budget-- the tempo switch between the chorus and verses on ""No Love For Ya"" jars very each time, and at one point, the volume on the song increases inexplicably. But otherwise, the production is, grimy, melodic, and diverse, and Moe works as well over the melted downtempo keys of ""My Life"" as he does the weepy chipmunk-soul melodrama of ""Find My Way"" and ""T.I.N.O."". Moe reportedly burned through about 30 tracks for this project, the mark of a hungry young talent, and he fills up every inch of <i>Humble Hustle 2</i>, as if he's already unsure how he'll find enough time to tell us everything that's on his mind.</p></div>"|18279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18279-young-moe-humble-hustle-2/|7.4|Jayson Greene

Even a brief flash of inspiration can get you there. Take Alex Burkat, a Brooklyn-based electronic musician, now part of Amanda Brown's house-y <a href=""http://www.notnotfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Not Not Fun</a> offshoot, <a href=""http://www.listentosilk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">100% Silk</a>. The story goes that Burkat was out dancing at a <a href=""http://mistersaturdaynight.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mister Saturday Night</a> party, where he was so inspired that he sent the organizers his <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Alex-Burkat-Shower-Scene/release/4383062"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shower Scene""</a> track. It became as his first single on the Mister Saturday Night label, with ""Tarot"" providing a quick follow up. With ""Tarot"", there were already signs of progress since ""Shower Scene"", signs of dialing down of the epic tendencies of that track, a sense of getting comfortable working on a smaller patch of turf. The difference in the two records is like seeing a career in miniature, with a more robust vision in place after barely any time has passed.</p>
<p>Burkat is still that guy caught up in the jubilation of clubland, but the tracks that make up <i>Tarot</i> hint at how those experiences stimulate reflection as well as hands-in-the-air euphoria. It's on the experimental end of downtempo house, although it never gets too far out there, instead settling into solid grooves that sometimes mirror the mood of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5293-pantha-du-prince/"">Pantha du Prince</a>'s benchmark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13947-black-noise/""><i>Black Noise</i></a>. There are three tracks here plus ""Tarot (Global Warming Mix)”, which adds a decent amount of steel to its framework. The varieties in mood are all tied up in a form of future dreaming, with Burkat constructing work that increasingly trepidates as it progresses. It's softer than something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29925-kuedo/"">Kuedo</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15945-severant/""><i>Severant</i></a>, but takes its mood from similar sources, interlacing a strand of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ballardian</a> doom as its central aesthetic.</p>
<p>It's an EP that steadily plummets into sci-fi fears as it progresses, suggesting Burkat was mindful of spinning a mini-narrative through these works-- ""Tarot"" is comparatively bubbly when stacked up against the knuckle-dragging bass welts of ""Four Seasons"". Still, there's a feeling that Burkat hasn't figured out exactly where he's going yet, especially when viewing the wildly gimmicky <a href=""http://vimeo.com/66846598"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for ""Tarot"". Patched together from iPhone photos, some altered through Instagram filters, the clip feels more suited to cheap seaside punk nostalgists than the Brave New World thinking conjured up by the track itself. The Global Warming mix returns a layer of mystery, adding a loop of digital glitch that mostly removes ""Tarot"" from the joyous territory the original skirts around, instead depositing it into a space that fits with the moodier other tracks.</p>
<p>These are still early days for Burkat and it's likely that he's still figuring out where he wants to go; certainly the change in style from the wide-open ""Shower Scene"" to the techno-mope of ""Last Cigarette"" is vast. But there's enough on this EP to suggest he'd be wise to stick around down there, making the kind of dance music that alternates between staring-at-your-shoes miserablism and trancey floor fillers. On ""Last Cigarette"", he gets the switch from one to the other exactly right, spending half the track lost in anticipation, the midway point's payoff hitting a perfectly transportative note. Now Burkat just needs to figure out where he wants to take his audience all the time, because with cheesy cut-and-paste videos at one end and immersive future gazing at the other, it's clear that his vision needs a little tightening.</p></div>"|18252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18252-alex-burkat-tarot/|6.6|Nick Neyland

At the very least there wouldn’t be “No Below”, one of the most striking songs on Northampton, Mass., noise-pop quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz/"">Speedy Ortiz</a>’s proper debut <i>Major Arcana</i>. “I didn’t know you when I broke my knee,” frontwoman Sadie Dupuis murmurs during the song’s wounded, palm-muted intro, “Spent the summer on crutches, and everybody teased.” Gnarled yet stingingly heartfelt, “No Below” blooms into a portrait of the artist as a friendless tween: death-obsessed, ditched by the one person at school who gets her, and left “freezing alone with [her] thoughts.” You know, the kind of early-onset trauma from which great, off-kilter bedroom-pop eventually springs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The first album to bear Speedy Ortiz’s name (which itself is a nod to a doomed character in the beloved alt-comic <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_and_Rockets_(comics)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Love and Rockets</span></a>) was a solo affair. Dupuis’ self-recorded 2011 release <a href=""http://freemusicarchive.org/music/speedy_ortiz/the_death_of_speedy_ortiz/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Death of Speedy Ortiz</i></a> was a patchy, sardonic (sample titles: “Hexxy Sadie”, “Kinda Blew”) lo-fi gem in the tradition of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3733-sebadoh/"">Sebadoh</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a>’s legendary <i>Girlysound</i> tapes. But like the heroine of “No Below” (who later finds a companion to compare scars with: “Everything fucked up we both felt before/ I’m glad for it all if it got us where we are”), Dupuis eventually found strength in numbers. By the time Speedy Ortiz’s promising<a href=""http://speedyortiz.bandcamp.com/album/sports-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> Sports</i></a> EP came out last year, she’d brought in some new recruits-- bassist Darl Ferm, guitarist Matt Robidoux, and drummer Mike Falcone-- to kick the firepower up a notch. It worked wonders: A Speedy Ortiz song used to sound like a personally gummed, exactingly aimed spitball, but the best ones on the explosive, earthquaking <i>Major Arcana</i> land like grenades.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, even as their songs have grown louder, gnarlier, and more compositionally ambitious, Speedy Ortiz have managed to preserve the intimacy and idiosyncrasy that made Dupuis’ early home recordings so compelling. Which is a testament not just to producer Justin Pizzoferrato (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr.</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30568-chelsea-light-moving/"">Chelsea Light Moving</a>) but also to how receptively and thoughtfully all four members play off each other: Ferm and Falcone keep <i>Major Arcana</i>’s rhythms feeling fluid and adventurous but never sloppy, while the ongoing conversation between Dupuis’s vocals and Robidoux’s trebly, agile riffs is particularly essential to Speedy’s charm. As it does on “No Below”’s caustic, catchy chorus (“And though I once said/ I was better off just being dead”), Robidoux’s guitar usually mirrors or embroiders Dupuis’ vocal melody, underscoring her words rather than drowning them out.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And thank goodness-- because <i>Major Arcana</i> finds Speedy Ortiz joining a depressingly small club of young indie rock bands (maybe the first new members since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"">Parquet Courts</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17405-light-up-gold/""><i>Light Up Gold</i></a>) writing lyrics that are actually worth poring over. “My mouth is a factory for every toxic part of speech I spew,” Dupuis quivers on the Mascis-indebted sludgefest “Tiger Tank”, and the rest of the record makes good on that promise. Like her hero Stephen Malkmus (she was once the frontwoman of an all-female <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement </a>cover band called-- wait for it-- Babement) Dupuis sings like someone palpably fascinated with the way words sound. Check, for one example, the way she scales the line, “criminally twisted puny little villain” in the opening moments of “Fun”, delighting in the texture of every vowel. Her lines strike a tricky balance between feeling loose and meticulously crafted-- another trick she must have learned from memorizing Malkmus quotables. On highlights like “Pioneer Spine” or the hellraising “Cash Cab”, Dupuis has a knack for turning seemingly dribbled-out mouthfuls into catchy hooks; in a lot of cases you won’t stop to marvel at the ingenuity of her lines until you’re already singing along.</p>
<p>Speedy Ortiz wear their love of the 1990s on their torn, flannel sleeves, which makes this particular round of Spot the Influence about as challenging as a game of teeball: there’s the squalling, guitar-on-guitar carnage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/123-archers-of-loaf/"">Archers of Loaf</a>, the grungy mysticism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1920-helium/"">Helium</a> (Dupuis lifted the title <i>Major Arcana</i> from a book she was reading on black magic), and of course the deadpan wit of vintage Phair (“I was never the witch that you made me to be,” Dupuis tells a burnt-out old flame on “Plough”, “Still you picked a virgin over me”). But don’t let any of that lead you to think that Speedy Ortiz are your garden variety nostalgists. Even at its most distortion-caked, there’s a melodic confidence and a gimlet-eyed clarity about <i>Major Arcana</i> that’s a rare find in a debut. They’ve got reverence for their forebears, sure, but unlike a lot of recent bands exhuming the ghosts of indie rock past, Speedy Ortiz also have faith in the peculiar personality traits that set them apart from their heroes. With its quaking rhythms, twisted riffage, and jet-black wit, <i>Major Arcana</i> is a redemptive ode to the broken bones that grew back together a little crooked-- the ones that taught Dupuis how to walk in her own weird way.</p></div>"|18245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18245-speedy-ortiz-major-arcana/|8.4|Lindsay Zoladz

Murrow High School student who channeled Native Tongues-style rap music with a deceptively sharp edge while heading up the intriguing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30965-pro-era/"">Pro Era</a> collective. Simply put, the kid could rap. No matter how much his flows echoed the work of his chosen style’s well-entrenched pioneers (Mos Def, Common, Q-Tip, Doom), his skills were such that <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16864-1999/"">1999</a></i> was a fresh, welcome spin on well-worn subject matter. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Since that initial excitement, a lot has happened. In December, one of Joey’s best friends, Pro Era’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30821-capital-steez/"">Capital STEEZ</a>, tragically took his own life amid <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/bOpRy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a storm of strange rumors</a>, tweeting “<a href=""https://twitter.com/CapitalSTEEZ_/status/283074491498770432"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The end</a>” the night he committed suicide. Around the same time as STEEZ’s death, Joey turned down an offer to sign with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation imprint, later saying it would take a $3 million dollar advance to sign him (A$AP Rocky, who rose to prominence at roughly the same age, reportedly got that figure from RCA). All the drama pulls down <i>Summer Knights</i>, a record that mines the same bank of 90s rap influences but does so with a more negative, fuck-the-world mentality. The enthusiastic momentum that buoyed <i>1999</i> is missing, and <i>Summer Knights</i> is much cloudier proposition.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even imbued with a darker tint than his debut mixtape, the touchpoints often feel clumsy. It starts with the lyrics: “Somehow the rap game reminds me of the trap game/ In fact is the exact same, and these tracks is my crack ‘caine,” raps Joey on “Sweet Dreams”. Knotty lines like “Fulfill your needs with similes non similar/ Spit that unfamiliar, put that on familia” (“Hillary $wank”) amount to nicely rapped nonsense. There’s much talk of “similes and verbs”, “metaphysics”, and there are direct homages: “Sorry Bonita” chops up A Tribe Called Quest’s spacey classic “Bonita Applebum”, and there’s a song called “Word Is Bond”. It’s one thing to bat around references, ping-ponging them in a way that riffs on the established themes and vocabulary of rap music. But the approach feels off. Take “Death of YOLO”, a song built off a promising, darkly funny concept-- the protagonist of the song is dead, having taken YOLO too far. Why deliver it with a straight face? </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">All that said, <i>Summer Knights </i>features strong production. If I had to pick a Native Tongues record to compare it to, it'd be the back half of A Tribe Called Quest’s relatively downcast <i>Beats Rhymes &amp; Life</i>, where keys, hi-hats, snares, and low basslines mingle to create a warm bed of texture to get loose over. Joey can still rap, but the producers on <i>Summer Knights</i>-- Pro Era affiliates Chuck Strangers, Kirk Knight and Lee Bannon with single tracks produced by DOOM, Statik Selektah and Oddissee respectively-- are the real highlights here. While something like “#LongLiveSTEELO” is an affecting, heartfelt cut from Joey-- it’s basically Joey’s version of “I’ll Be Missing You”, complete with Faith Evans-like backup-- you’re 16 tracks deep into a listless affair.</p>
<p>Instead of embracing the styles of more contemporary-minded peers and bending those sounds into his own shapes-- seemingly a must in today's rap climate, if you want to work with a major and get played on the radio-- <i>Summer Knights</i> moves in the other direction, retreating to well-made templates without adding anything to them. Joey deals with heavier shit, but feels weighed down by it. The clunky lyrics wouldn't be a big of a deal if lyricism in the mode of his heroes wasn't<i> </i>one of the aspects he was deliberately playing up. But the deeper problem is one of tone. Joey too often comes out looking like someone who’s already grown weary of the system, an 18-year-old curmudgeon, a sharp contrast with the energy that <i>1999</i> promised.</p></div>"|18276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18276-joey-bada-summer-knights/|6.8|Corban Goble

It's just as well-- Trash Talk are now very much aesthetically linked with Odd Future, which isn't a fate BDoD needed after their 2011 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15350-gb-city/""><i>GB City</i></a>. That album had some killer hooks, but a couple of unremarkable tracks kept it from being a truly powerful opening statement. This band didn't need any distractions, Odd Future-based or otherwise. John Barrett had to focus on hammering out an even better Bass Drum of Death album, and maybe more importantly, finding a distinctive aesthetic. (Barrett is the sole creative force behind <i>Bass Drum of Death</i>, having written and recorded the entire thing by himself.) The Mississippi native is, after all, releasing an album the same year we've gotten solid new ones from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17559-fidlar/"">FIDLAR</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17786-wavves-afraid-of-heights/"">Wavves</a>, to name two.</p>
<p>So does their new self-titled album capitalize on the immediacy of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-sT-fUnxiI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Get Found""</a>, differentiate itself from the rest of rock's oversaturated market, and pack in better songs? No. It doesn't do any of those things. Barrett delivers some solid melodies, but they're usually cheapened by his tendency to draw out one good idea for far too long. Every song on this album could stand to be tightened. Most could lose a verse or two, and a lot of them would sound much better if they were played faster. Seriously, this thing could dominate if it had the pacing of an OFF! record. But that's not the case. ""Shattered Me"" is the easy single, with its earworm melody and run-time of two minutes, and even <i>that </i>feels like it goes on for too long. There are tracks with good energy and solid hooks that are unfortunately long (""Bad Reputation"") and some that are flat-out boring (""White Fright""). And it's easy to understand the impulse to make a paced jam with a sludgy low-end like they do with ""No Demons"", but the last thing this album needs is another track that feels slow.</p>
<p>In many ways, this album offers a natural extension of the work Barrett did on <i>GB City</i>, from his power chord drive to the smoke billowing out of his mouth on the cover. Like that album, this one hosts some undeniable bangers, like album opener ""I Wanna Be Forgotten"". It's exactly the right length, it's got the right drive for the melody, and with a spitfire delivery, Barrett knows exactly how to blurt a line like ""buy a car, get fucked, be dead."" Just like ""Get Found"" before it, it's the sort of song that could serve as a mantra of sorts for BDoD. It's a dirty, concise, satisfying summation of what they're capable of, sort of like what ""Hunchback"" did for Kurt Vile's <i>Childish Prodigy</i>. Barrett even delivers a solid psych track on ""Such a Bore"". The vocals and guitars on that track and the smoldering jam ""Faces of the Wind"" are smothered with psych reverb. As it turns out, Barrett wears <i>Nuggets</i> really well.</p>
<p>The other thing that quietly works against <i>Bass Drum of Death</i> is its easy comparison. Of <i>GB City</i>, David Bevan <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15350-gb-city/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">wrote</a> that the band were at their best ""when whipping up an evil frenzy much like those of Ty Segall,"" though for all that album's garage rock immediacy, Segall was undeniably the more consistent songwriter. That was two years ago, and once again, Segall feels like an inescapable point of reference. It's probably not intentional, but there are several moments where Barrett implements these vocal nuances that sound <i>just</i> like Ty's. And when that Segall drawl pops up in these overlong Bass Drum of Death songs, it's an unfortunate reminder that these guys don't come close to their peers' seemingly effortless way with writing tight, exciting rock songs.</p></div>"|18229.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18229-bass-drum-of-death-bass-drum-of-death/|5.9|Evan Minsker

<p>Over the last decade, a spate of pastiche-fiends have been mining previously dormant genres for inspiration-- and as a result, dudes like Bruce Hornsby and Nile Rodgers are now serving unexpected, late-career stints as alt-touchstones. “Jam bands,” though-- long the presumed terrain of white people in dreadlocks and homemade pants-- stay largely unsung; maybe there’s something too dopey about the contemporary scene, or something too ambitious about the virtuosity high-caliber jams require. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5843-grateful-dead/"">The Grateful Dead</a> remain the grand exception, a band that’s somehow both an embodiment of and an outlier within their field. The Dead’s best live jams are emotional, melodically dizzying romps, rightly treasured for their ability to insulate a listener from whatever shitty things might be transpiring elsewhere. There’s safety in those songs. Getting close to it can feel euphoric.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31339-steve-gunn/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Gunn</a>, a sometime-guitarist in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vile</a>’s Violators and one half of the Gunn-Truscinski Duo, is offering the same kind of shelter on <i>Time Off</i>, a collection of six loose, spiraling guitar songs that give more than they ask: These are generous compositions, gently presented. Gunn’s a descendent of the Dead, but also of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/648-jj-cale/"" target=""_blank"">J.J. Cale</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15831-la-monte-young/"" target=""_blank"">La Monte Young</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4970-bert-jansch/"" target=""_blank"">Bert Jansch</a> and Frank Hutchinson, and his guitar playing has a mesmeric quality, a tender circling that feels almost like being swaddled. Which is not to belittle their potency, or Gunn’s craft: he’s a nimble, expressive guitarist and a pleasantly lackadaisical vocalist, singing, as he does, about his Brooklyn neighborhood, or water bumping a waterwheel into motion, or taking a certain path through a field. There’s an unrefined, organic quality to Gunn’s work that occasionally recalls Chicago stalwarts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/651-califone/"" target=""_blank"">Califone</a> or early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3543-red-red-meat/"" target=""_blank"">Red Red Meat</a>-- a reinterpretation of “Americana” that allows for plenty of ingenuity (and requires no costuming).</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Gunn’s voice is rambling and soft, but he’s a welcome guide wherever and whenever he shows up-- like a third of the way into “Street Keeper”, when his vocals hitch onto a sweet guitar refrain, or on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15382-water-wheel/"" target=""_blank"">“Water Wheel”</a>, where he sounds, momentarily, like the late Shannon Hoon, mewing placidly about a river. There are bits here that feel improvised-- or at least slack enough to suggest improvisation-- but Gunn’s songs still rely on patterns and interactions that were clearly composed with care. It helps that his backers (John Truscinski on drums and Justin Tripp on bass) are as comfortable with a groove (see “New Decline”, especially) as they are with hoisting up Gunn’s guitar. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Like all acoustic guitarists with extensive record collections, Gunn has endured plenty of comparisons to John Fahey, but the association feels almost too facile to perpetuate: While Gunn’s produced some more explicitly cerebral work (for a time, he was into manipulating tapes of field recordings), <i>Time Off</i>’s biggest asset is its ease. There’s a real sense, listening to these tracks, that everything could be a little simpler if we all stopped trying so hard. It is deeply mellow in a way that the famously cantankerous Fahey would have likely found confounding.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It’s also a record that happens to make tremendous sense right now, on the precipice of summer, when we’re all anxious to uncurl a little. On “Lurker”, Gunn sings repeatedly about finding “a spot to kill time and look around,” and while it’s ostensibly an innocent observation of a neighborhood drifter, it ends up feeling more like a directive-- advice to heed. Find a spot, kill some time. Look around. </p></div>"|18176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18176-steve-gunn-time-off/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

Against all odds, ""Game of Thrones"" has managed to make fantasy novels sexy: burly, hirsute tribesmen and corset-busting maidens populate an intrigue-infested feudal world, slicing and dicing their way towards Valhalla beneath a hypothetical soundtrack comprised of Motörhead standbys and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26979-amon-amarth/"" target=""_blank"">Amon Amarth</a> deep cuts. It sounds like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Silmarillion Mach 7</a>, and has proven to be popular with everyone from the bumbling professor next door to your grandma’s hairdresser, but what about the old school fantasy fans? What about the <i>nerds</i>?</p>
<p>Fear not, fellow geeks. <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31331-summoning/"">Summoning</a>’s got your back. It’s undeniable that these Austrian keyboard enthusiasts are dyed-in-the-wool Tolkien obsessives, swiveling the epic scope of ""Lord of the Rings"" square onto the soaring highs and rumbling lows of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22972-bathory/"">Bathory</a>’s Viking odes. There’s a lot more to them than that, of course, even in simply musical terms. Their latest album, <i>Old Mornings Dawn</i>, marks their seventh foray into Middle Earth (not counting a handful of demos and EPs) and will feel like a homecoming to longtime fans. Its lineage can be traced straight back to their 1995 classic <i>Minas Morgul</i>, but these old dogs have picked up a trick or two along the way as their stellar recent output will attest. Their last full-length, <i>Oath Bound</i>, came out back in 2006, and showed a marked progression from its predecessor; <i>Old Mornings Dawn</i> follows the same path especially when the guitar lines are concerned, but spends plenty of time looking backwards towards past triumphs, as well.</p>
<p>The core Summoning sound has barely changed since before the original Nordic black metal’s Second Wave entered its death throes, and Burzum and Emperor’s obvious impact on their sound is proof enough that its roots within that circle are still firm. Protector and Silenius adhere to a strict formula of hypnotic black metal riffs, grandiose keyboard melodies, and vocals that range from harsh, throaty croaks to rumbling spoken word, topped off with a heady swig of pagan folk metal’s chants and choruses. The title track features a rousing choir of Vikings in full voice, and more traditional male/female choirs add color to the majority of the album as well. There’s a sweeping cinematic feel to the proceedings; if any of you guys know Peter Jackson’s sound guy, now might be the time to give him a call. The keyboards often take center stage, piling on the cheese and, at times, stifling the guitar work. Summoning’s approach is an acquired taste, to be sure, but sports acres more heft than is offered by similarly key-heavy “epic” metal bands like Rhapsody of Fire or Blind Guardian. There’s a darkness to it.</p>
<p>That’s nothing compared to the rhythm section, though. Long a thorn in purists’ sides, Summoning’s now legendary programmed drums are unapologetically inorganic, an essential afterthought that come across as almost militaristic in their simplicity. They even skitter into bongo-driven territory on tracks like “Flammifer”, “Earthshine,” and “Of Pale White Morn”, the latter of which sounds like an outtake from Disney’s <i>Tarzan</i> soundtrack until the guitars... and Orc sounds kick in.</p>
<p>Yep. Summoning is so slavishly devoted to their cause that they’ll toss in Orc samples when the moment feels right. You’d almost wonder if these guys are serious, but the diverse and beautifully orchestrated songwriting on this album speaks for itself. <i>Old Mornings Dawn</i> is a more than worthy addition to their canon, and a wholly satisfying treat for fans who’ve been waiting nearly a decade for the next adventure.</p></div>"|18092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18092-summoning-old-mornings-dawn/|6.9|Kim Kelly

Its best moments used the churn and snap of “crunk’n’b” as a vehicle to re-imagine and repackage the frothy, light-hearted dancefloor charm of early <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_jackson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Janet Jackson</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Lisa_and_Cult_Jam"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lisa Lisa and the Cult Jam</a>, only replacing girlish energy with insouciance and reserve. She wanted you to drip the sweat she never perspires. And while this mix of qualities made Ciara seem more distinctive and unique than a more solidly traditional R&amp;B diva might, it’s always seemed like Ciara <i>gets </i>R&amp;B at its core, that she’s invested in exploring all the ways the music can move you. Perhaps consequently, the mixed qualitative and commercial fortunes of her career since have mirrored the fortunes of the genre itself. It’s easy to think that if Ciara could put out an album that consistently captured the best of her talents, that record alone might be enough to help R&amp;B reassume the throne of commercial dominance. </p>
<p class=""p1"">I suspect <i>Ciara </i>is not that album, but it roughly matches the quality of 2010’s <i>Basic Instinct</i>, probably her most consistent album up to that point. Which should be good enough to keep the dream alive a little longer. <i>Ciara</i> also touches on just about every facet of her style to date, and while she’s a more versatile, accomplished singer than when she started, her appeal remains essentially unchanged. At her best, Ciara comes on less as a full-blooded personality or even an object of desire and more as a glamorous big sister, the one you want to be when you grow up, who knows all the right moves on the dancefloor and in life. Complexity and personal drama ain’t in it: Ciara holds out the dazzling promise of somehow transcending all of that.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So it’s not surprising that <i>Ciara </i>feels slightly (though <i>only</i> slightly) weaker when she swims against the current of her own charm and<i> </i>tries for “raw.” “I’ve just been through a break up” she announces flatly on the blaring, Nicki Minaj-assisted opener “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15518-ciara-im-out-ft-nicki-minaj/"">I’m Out</a>”, and while she’s probably aiming for some mixture of bold personal statement and casual don’t-give-a-fuck swag, all you can hear is the deliberateness. Rihanna, a more limited singer than Ciara, can sound convincingly dead on tunes like “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20DR2oZbs3o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pour It Up</a>”, but Ciara’s stabs at a similar vibe can have a dress-ups quality, like she’s practicing her enervated monotone recitals in front of the mirror, singing into her lipstick. Ciara has done “hard” plenty of times, but on past tunes like “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSYCI4K5qGM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oh</a>” or “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp6W4aK1sbs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ride</a>” she effectively floated above the fray, untouched by the violence even as she endorsed it. “I’m Out” and Ciara’s Nicki-aping rap on (the otherwise excellent) “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7yxp9A6qZw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Super Turnt Up</a>” are enough to confirm aggression is not her strong suit.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Conversely, the delectable, “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZdMFB4BhrQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Boo</a>”-referencing slow jam single “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15056-ciara-body-party/"">Body Party</a>” finds the singer in top form, its billowing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Will_Made_It"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mike Will Made It</a> synth chords and crashing snares the perfect setting for Ciara’s light as a feather performance. The key line is “I’m having so much <i>fun</i> with you”, delivered with startled exuberance: even sex, in Ciara’s world, resembles the more innocent sensual pleasure of dancing. Likewise the double entendre-filled cunnilingus ode “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IixNowuECP0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read My Lips</a>”, perky electro-pop delivered with such frothy, wide-eyed innocence that it’s hard even to notice the subject matter. This same sense of uncomplicated exhilaration raises the straightforward, 2013 carbon dated club-pop of “Livin’ It Up” and “Overdose” from throwaway to highlight status, their obviousness transformed into a virtue through the singer’s palpable enjoyment. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The marvelous closing remix of “Body Party” (with features from Future and B.o.B.) underscores this (and the “My Boo” resemblance) by adding a popping bass beat, further submerging Ciara’s come-ons within easy dancefloor camaraderie. It’s a bewitching vision of life without any room for doubts or sadness-- except, perhaps, for the bittersweet realization that contemporary pop doesn’t sound <i>just like this </i>nearly enough.</p></div>"|18280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18280-ciara-ciara/|7.3|Tim Finney

The compilation series asks artists to create their ultimate ""late night"" mix and has featured a variety of acts, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15885-mgmt/"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16428-belle-and-sebastian-latenighttales-vol-2/"" target=""_blank"">Belle &amp; Sebastian</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>, Jamiroquai, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10537-late-night-tales/"" target=""_blank"">Lindstrøm</a>. The line-up's been so diverse, it's interesting it took until now to ask <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3611-royksopp/"" target=""_blank"">Röyksopp</a> to curate an entry: the group's always showcased a smart design sense as well as an open acknowledgement of other music's influence on their work. Unsurpisingly then, on their 19-track collection, the veteran <span class=""st"">Norwegian dance </span>duo's instincts on curation and sequencing are top-notch, offering a feeling that's sweetly compelling but gently guarded.</p>
<p>“Daddy’s Groove”, the duo's sole original contribution to <i>Late Night Tales</i>, is the opener. In light of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>’s retro doings this year, the title, the treated vocals, and the easy pulsing pace of the song feel shaped by larger trends. Röyksopp also offer a studio recording of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a> B-side “Ice Machine”. Their version features fellow Norwegian performer Susanne Sundfør on lead vocals and a generally faithful take in the main arrangement with a slow, dramatic start to give it its own flavor. Sundfør’s lead vocals contrast nicely with a brief midsong break from the duo.</p>
<p>Röyksopp's selections generally live somewhere in a late-1970s/early-80s setting. The most compelling include Tuxedomoon’s “In a Manner of Speaking”, a showcase for part-time member Winston Tong’s portrayal of romantic miscommunication over a stark arrangement of nervous guitar and distant swirls, Vangelis’ “Blade Runner Blues”, a pure synthesizer realization of the late-night and disconnected melancholy of <i>Blade Runner</i> that steers clear of the pounding doom of its end theme, and F. R. David’s remarkable synth ballad “Music”, which sounds like a Eurovision winner with all heart and inspiraiton and no irony, even 30 years after it was originally written.</p>
<p>There are also choices that merrily trash received ideas of coolness. Like “Stranger on the Shore”, Acker Bilk’s clarinet-lined Easy Listening smash from the early 60s, which is a kind of outlier from the midcentury that nails both big band jazz and romantic film music. Ready to be reclaimed by the cassette/chillwave generation, Andreas Vollenweider's 1981 track “Hands and Clouds” is a brief bit of swirling delicacy that sounds like a lost track from the high point of West Coast radio stations like the Wave. Meanwhile, the neo-classical impulses of acts like Johann Johannsson, whose composition of strings and deep electronic bass plus voice of “Odi Et Amo” features here, showcase a further connection at work.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Part of this <i>Late Night Tales</i>' joy lies in the atypicality of the choices from bands that might not seem to fit at first. “The Somnambulist” is an XTC B-side recorded in 1980, when the group was peeling out energetic brawlers like “Generals and Majors” and “Life Begins at the Hop,” but the song consists solely of Andy Partridge’s voice in a calmly sung undertone over a moody keyboard/drum machine riff. Thomas Dolby’s similarly chirpier side is exchanged for a slower grooving funk punch on “Budapest by Blimp”, itself acting as a callback to earlier numbers on the disc like Vangelis and Rare Bird’s 1977 effort “Passing Through”, while still standing out in its own right, concluding choir vocals and all. This Mortal Coil's showcased not through something overfamiliar like “Song to the Siren”, but via their live-in-a-room sounding cover of Emmy Lou Harris’s “Till I Can Gain Control Again”.</p>
<p>There's a sweetly consistent mood throughout; it’s something you can put on and treat as ambient sound, but there’s also a clever subtlety in their process. Rare Bird’s entry leads into the similarly paced and feeling “Light of Day” by the Little River Band from three years later, but the latter’s lusher harmonies-- not to mention string accompaniment-- feel like a wider development of the easy, understated swing already introduced by the former song. Following the steady, descending feeling of “Music” with Prelude’s reverb-heavy a capella 1974 cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>’s “After the Goldrush” is breathtaking. Immediately continuing with the literal wave crashes and bossa nova lounge lizardry of Richard Schneider Jr.’s 1977 cut “Hello Beach Girls” maintains and reworks that mood, Schneider’s occasional laughs and smooth smarm a remarkable contrast to Prelude’s steady, angelic approach. </p>
<p>The collection ends with English actor Benedict Cumberbatch continuing his spoken word story from last fall's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26767-friendly-fires/"" target=""_blank"">Friendly Fires</a> entry in the series. The tale of a night out and house party is not quite of a piece with the rest, but it is a literal late night tale-- and, hey, why not stick with a theme? In any event, ending on a note that's both ruminative and engaging works well with Röyksopp’s intent, fitting into the overall series with a yacht-rock-for-fjords feeling that's all its own.</p></div>"|18168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18168-royksopp-late-night-tales/|7.4|Ned Raggett

The Australian native sings and more often howls in a louche, heavily accented brogue that rarely has much use for cadence or strict melody-- a confrontational pose that startles the listener into attention. He also performs solo, looping his guitar and vocals through a battery of effects and headsets, relieving you of the temptation to focus your eyes elsewhere. During a recent show in Los Angeles, he wore Stars and Stripes boxers and asked the crowd if it would be a federal crime to shit his pants. He then performed the last two songs in nothing but his underwear. Typical stuff, but nonetheless, Callinan manages to distinguish himself on a basic songwriting level with his debut album. While most of his peers deal with matters of the heart and head, <i>Embracism </i>is a physical record, one of grabbing hands, gnashing teeth, and thrusting groins. It holds a mirror up to the human body and reveals something alternately beautiful, hairy, awkward, scarred and imperfect, but rarely less than fascinating.</p>
<p>While <i>Embracism</i> is a treatise, it’s not some sort of high-minded dissertation. On the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15311-embracism/"">title track</a>, one of the year’s most riveting singles, Callinan snarls the only question that seems to matter to him: “Do you measure up? Or do you still got work to do?” Contrary to the assumption that man has become a sedentary and domesticated animal in 2013, “Embracism” lays out his waking life as a constant struggle to prove one’s mettle, on the schoolyard, in the boardroom, in the bedroom, or “on the internet, RIGHT NOW!” The only difference between any of these competitive arenas is the skew of the “passive-aggressive” ratio; it’s all the same combat to satisfy primal urges for sex and the upper hand. It's best expressed on non-album track “MSBT &amp; Wait”, a scorched earth screed on platonic relationships where Callinan doesn't want to hear he's just a friend: ""I feel used... He would fuck you/ He masturbates/ And you share my secrets with him.""</p>
<p>Callinan particularly relishes playing the wounded alpha male, and whether it’s a nasty breakup or death, loss hangs over <i>Embracism.</i> It’s always rendered in tactile ways and between the erratic shrapnel of percussion, jagged guitar, and Callinan’s serrated vocals, you’re going to <i>feel Embracism. </i>“Chardonnay Sean” plays out more like a graveside confession than a song, as Callinan expresses guilt at what appears to be a fatal drunk driving incident, picking through the shards of a windshield and wine glass. Conversely, “Scraps” deals with a much different kind of automotive disaster, a remorseless revenge fantasy where the offending party rests “compacted with the scraps of my Nissan."" </p>
<p>So clearly, Callinan’s got issues to sort out, as does <i>Embracism. </i>That whole Hampton bit in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>'s “New Slaves” proved that the obvious double entendre promised by “Come on USA” can still be virile, but the phallic shock and awe here lies limp when you can't discern whether lines like “the land of the free/ Is not what it claims to be"" and ""I cry when I listen to Springsteen"" are commenting on cliche or just cliche themselves. And while “Scraps” and “Chardonnay Sean” are intriguing narratives, they're stuck in ponderous musical arrangements; the<i> </i>effect of sequencing them consecutively puts <i>Embracism </i>in a serious mid-album lull.</p>
<p>But you get the sense of an artist whose songwriting potential hasn’t been maximized, as Callinan’s got the vocal chops to keep <i>Embracism </i>interesting throughout. The industrial grind of “Halo” introduces Callinan as some instinct-driven, proto-human being, skulking out of primordial ooze, and “Landslide” casts him every bit as effective as a balladeer when he works within a tight structure. Thanks to the production and mixing of Kim Moyes (the Presets) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a>’s Chris Taylor, <i>Embracism </i>remains fidgety and unbalanced in service of its narrator-- even the imperial pomp-rock of “Victoria M” can’t play it quite straight.</p>
<p>It’s one of the instances that suggest Callinan isn’t a cynic so much as a disillusioned romantic. You can hear aerobic electro rock workouts “Stretch It Out” and “Way II War” as self-help mantras, where you can physically work your way into right thinking. And on the closing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15548-kirin-j-callinan-love-delay/"">“Love Delay”</a>, you understand why Bruce Springsteen gets Callinan all teary-eyed. He lasciviously stares down a disrobed lover and communes with fire over nothing more than severely pitch-shifted guitars, a naked performance that renders the title literal. And then, no more delay-- <i>Embracism </i>hurtles towards a finish in a manner that’s more shocking than what preceded it, largely because it’s such a conventional crowd-pleasing rush of distorted bass, rafter-reaching yells, and the first appearance of a traditional drum kit. If Callinan continues on this tack, he just may end up singing it in arenas, but for the time being, “Love Delay” is an apt closer for his initial phase. After all, “Love Delay” underlines what the title track suggests as an answer to every misunderstanding in our overly talkative society: let’s hug it out.</p></div>"|18266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18266-kirin-j-callinan-embracism/|7.4|Ian Cohen

It didn’t help that the music sounded too polished, too polite, too professional, with too little grit and personality.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, Isbell’s story appears to have a happy third act. His friends confronted him about his drinking and checked him into rehab, and he emerged sober, determined, and newly focused. He got married (to the fiddler/songwriter Amanda Shires, who spearheaded his intervention), stayed clean, and recorded a new album<i>, Southeastern</i>. To his considerable credit, Isbell has very little interest in recounting his long fall or his darkest moments. This album doesn’t wallow in alcoholic squalor; its real subject is not what it means to hit rock bottom, but what happens after you pick yourself up. How do you allow yourself any kind of contentment or security when you’ve done such bad things? How do you live with that dark half lurking just offstage?</p>
<p>Isbell the storyteller knows this is rich subject matter, as the day-to-day conflict of not taking that next drink or not falling back into old ways proves much more compelling and humanizing than the non-conflict of simply bottoming out. That approach makes <i>Southeastern</i> his most gripping and his most personal album to date. “Live Oak”, the dark heart of the album, opens with Isbell singing a cappella: “There’s a man who walks besides me, he is who I used to be / I wonder if she sees him and confuses him with me.” It’s a deeply revealing line, but “Live Oak” isn’t a direct confession from Isbell. Instead, it’s a piece of fiction about a murderer wandering Pre-Civil War America who finds tentative redemption with a forgiving woman. It does not have a happy ending.</p>
<p>Isbell inhabits similar men throughout <i>Southeastern</i>, and there’s a new clarity in these characters to match the new vigor in his voice. To an extent they become proxies to recount Isbell’s own recent transformation, which prevents the album from becoming too hermetically introverted. As a storyteller, he has a generous empathy toward the people inhabiting his songs, most of whom display a hard-won humanity despite the extremes of their situations.</p>
<p>On “Elephant”, a barfly tries to comfort a friend dying of cancer, unsure what to do but finally understanding that just being there and raising a toast is enough to ensure she doesn’t die alone. It’s an epic rebuke of those hideous cancer ballads that infected mainstream country music for so many years; when <a href=""http://youtu.be/JhnU9IYTD9c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rascal Flatts</a> hear a line like, “There’s one thing that’s real clear to me: No one dies with dignity,” they ought to just pack in their Ed Hardy shirts and head home. An emotional kneecapping, “Elephant” is a standout on <i>Southeastern</i>, but for once it’s not one of two or three. Rather, it’s a crucial part of a statement album, one that draws as much from literary influences-- Peter Matthiessen, Shelby Foote, Colum McCann-- as from musical ones.</p>
<p><i>Southeastern</i> is easily Isbell’s best solo album-- his most richly conceived and generously written. If it’s not quite the album that lives up to his considerable talents, it’s mostly the music that’s to blame. The production, courtesy of Dave Cobb, tends to buff away the rough edges of Isbell’s songs, which can rob his stories of impact and nuance. It’s not the 400 Unit backing him this time, but this group of musicians can’t sell the rocker “Super 8” or give it the boisterous urgency it demands. It threatens to become make-do country rock, lacking the specificity and idiosyncrasy of Isbell’s songwriting. Perhaps it’s fitting that the one instrument that stands out is Shires’ fiddle, which eddies and shimmies throughout “Traveling Alone” before adding a solo as eloquently understated as Isbell’s chorus. Of course they have chemistry. </p></div>"|18283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18283-jason-isbell-southeastern/|7.7|Stephen M. Deusner

The former is a tense story-song whose impact derives from its restraint; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7335-joey-burns/"">Joey Burns</a> delivers the tale of tragedy in a conspiratorial whisper, as though passing along gossip at a highway cantina, and John Convertino-- even then one of the most inventive drummers around-- punctuates the violence with hard hits of his splash cymbal. “Frontera”, by contrast, sounds like the opening credits for some forgotten spaghetti western, with a shuffling beat, a barbed-wire tangle of guitar, and horns that announce the director of photography with appropriate grandeur. The scope on both songs is small, personal, and intimate, with ambitions that transcend the low budget.</p>
<p>In the 15 years since the release of <i>The Black Light</i>, those two songs have evolved dramatically from their original arrangements, gradually merging into one song that pops up from time to time on Calexico’s setlist. “Frontera/Trigger” is the opener and highlight of the band’s new live album, <i>Spiritoso, </i>and the differences between this version and the song’s previous incarnations underscore just how far Burns and Convertino have come in a decade, not to mention all that has been lost and gained along the way. Featuring the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, the song rumbles with thundering tympani, baroque strings, great blasts of brass, and what sounds like a klezmer band being heaved into Monument Valley. Together, the two songs become a widescreen, Technicolor epic of John Ford proportions, announcing that Calexico’s original ambitions have finally been matched with the means to realize them.</p>
<p>Originally a Record Store Day exclusive, <i>Spiritoso</i> documents a series of shows Calexico performed in Germany with the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg. Much like last year’s vinyl box set <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16060-calexico-selections-from-road-atlas-1998-2011/""><i>Road Atlas</i></a>, this live album has a casual retrospective feel, culling songs from throughout the band’s career but with no real attempt to be definitive. And much like the separate tour-only albums that comprised <i>Road Atlas,</i> it will most likely sound better as a complement to other live albums-- like 2009’s <i>Live in Nuremberg</i> or the upcoming <i>Ancienne Belgique Vol. 2</i>-- than it does as a stand-alone release.</p>
<p>Given the increasing scale of Calexico’s records, which have outgrown the minimalism of their first releases, an orchestral live album seems inevitable in retrospect. Once considered a sign of a rock artist’s delusional self-regard, this kind of collaboration no longer carries the stigma it might have in the past. To their credit, Calexico aren’t interested in using these orchestras to prove the importance of their own music. Rather than reinvent the songs, they accentuate and amplify the non-rock aspects that Calexico have long ago mastered: the soundtrack flourishes, the mariachi horn riffs, the jazzbo rhythms. “The News About William” bounces on its spry woodwind triplets, which mimic the rhythms of Convertino’s drums. “Black Heart” swells and fades ominously, like John Barry conveying intrigue and foreboding. It sounds like the greatest James Bond theme never used.</p>
<p>In other words, very little on <i>Spiritoso </i>sounds too far removed from its original incarnation, and nothing is nearly as transformative as “Frontera/Trigger”, which is the only song that truly shows off the possibilities of Calexico + orchestra. “Minas de Cobre”, another <i>Black Light</i> tune, is revved up and tricked out but maintains its original shape, while “Crystal Frontier” opens with a slow epilogue-- Burns setting the stage for his tale of the ancient among the modern-- before launching into its familiar fast tempo. Despite the strong performances and some inspired choices in arrangement, the album has the pall of a missed opportunity: not bad at all, but certainly not the major statement it could have been.</p></div>"|17972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17972-calexico-spiritoso/|6.8|Stephen M.

It’s such a deep, sonorous, chesty thing that carrying it around must weigh on him, and every lyric feels like a bench press. It’s a physical gift that doubles as a restriction. When you’ve got the ability to conjure Johnny Cash or any other <i>basso profundo </i>like Gibson, your artistic direction is laid out for you-- you’re probably not gonna make punk or R&amp;B. That was quite all right on last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16466-daughn-gibson-all-hell"">All Hell</a>, </i>an intriguing confluence of sampling and songwriting. It was something like <i>Odelay</i> if Beck's record was culled entirely from episodes of ""Cops"" and the kind of country cassettes available at truckstops. Otherwise, it sounded like nothing else. On <i>Me Moan</i>, his Sub Pop debut<i>, </i>Gibson<i> </i>wisely attempts to maintain the immediate draw of his authoritative vocals and perspective without making an exact replica of his first album. It’s an uneven record that lacks the spark of its predecessor, but a more diverse and accessible follow-up from an artist who’s laudably willing to take risks.</p>
<p>Compared to <i>All Hell, Me Moan </i>is more an album of various “songs” than a unified sound. And now, Gibson is coaxing music out of human beings (including members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"">Baroness</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/474-brokeback/"">Brokeback</a>) rather than samplers. He’s still treating it all like a rummage sale, even if the budget has emboldened his taste for chintz and levity. Gibson’s voice will undoubtedly draw more comparisons to golden country greats, though the closest <i>Me Moan </i>gets to any sort of “roots” music might be the cocaine cowboy balladry of “Won’t You Climb”. Otherwise, the songs here are pieced together with bagpipes, melodica, drum machines, and warped samples, adding rhinestone to Gibson’s trucker flannels. Even the one thing that sounds like it could be plucked out under the Mississippi moonlight (“All My Days Off”) has a riff that could easily segue into David Banner’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U61JP4KkFKc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Cadillac On 22’s”</a>.</p>
<p>But there’s the burden of <i>his</i> voice: like the terribly uncoordinated klutz who got put on the basketball team because he’s the tallest guy in school or the diffident offensive lineman with the thyroid condition, Gibson can seem pressed into action out of some kind of physical obligation. You just can’t hide with that baritone and so Gibson figures he might as well stand out as much as possible. The choruses of “Phantom Rider” and “Mad Ocean” teeter on kitsch based solely on their lyrics and Gibson delivers them with extra <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3VN54M1OXA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“we’re gonna move that convoy”</a> gusto.</p>
<p>This approach works on <i>Me Moan</i>’s more campy material, but when he tries to convey menace over <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nUVETWRN1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alabama 3</a>-style beats on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15487-you-dont-fade/"">“You Don’t Fade”</a>, he sounds retrograde instead of classicist; all that's missing is a video of Gibson chomping a cigar on the New Jersey Turnpike. Gibson’s hampered on the emotionally bare songs as well. “Franco” is <i>Me Moan</i>’s most immediately striking number, with chalky guitar harmonics and sobering reverb evoking a slippery-when-wet power ballad that shifts the focus from the docks of New Jersey to a trailer park <i>somewhere.</i> The ache in the chorus is palpable, as Gibson yearns to a tired lover,<i> </i>“I wish we had a kid that never wanted to die.” It’s a situation that begs for an earnest performance, but Gibson leans hard on the vowels in “campfire” and ""hour"" to the point where they sound like they’re curdling in his mouth (""camp-<i>foyer"" </i>and ""<i>orrrrrrr</i>,"" respectively). “Franco” is meant to be a tearjerker, but sometimes it feels like it’s poking you in the eye.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there’s a glaring disjunction between the detail of the music and the lack thereof in Gibson’s lyrics. <i>Me Moan </i>leaves a little <i>too much</i> to the imagination, and you might think that a year as a touring musician didn’t give Gibson as much raw material as his time in the cabin of an 18-wheeler. His more suggestive form of storytelling works on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15339-the-sound-of-law/"">“The Sound of Law”</a>: Gibson’s born on the roadside to an outlaw, more specifically, a beast of a man who doesn’t just kill, he “blows that fucker off to hell.” Though specifics are scarce, the music lets you fill in the blanks, as the charging drum rolls and girded guitar riffs generate the momentum of a moving train, plotting a perfect visual for a family that has to up and leave town at the faintest whine of a police siren.</p>
<p>But elsewhere, while the tone of Gibson’s vocals convey truth and wisdom, the songs rarely feel populated with fully drawn characters or narratives. Places like Lynn Falls and Pisgee Nest and the Rio Bar and Grill <i>sound </i>like where a character in a Daughn Gibson song might hang out, even if they’re not necessarily real. Over the span of <i>Me Moan, </i>this lack of geography starts to wear. Both “The Pisgee Nest” and “Kissin on the Blacktop” have evocative lines in their choruses that makes you want to lean in closer; yet they’re incomplete, memories or images of a state trooper’s daughter or a devious middle school friend that he couldn’t quite bring to life just yet. The result doesn’t take Gibson’s music off the open road, it just replaces mystery with mundanity: while <i>All Hell </i>felt imbued with danger and intrigue, on <i>Me Moan</i>, the people pulled off to highway shoulder are never in any real distress upon closer inspection. They just stepped out to check a map.</p></div>"|18248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18248-daughn-gibson-me-moan/|6.3|Ian Cohen

Gibbs' desire to return to his most authentic sound springs from a less-than-amicable split from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"" target=""_blank"">Young Jeezy</a>’s CTE label in 2012, and he isn't necessarily mistaken. <i>ESGN </i>is more of the dark, violent, exceedingly skillful rap for which the rapper has become one of the last reliable sources.</p>
<p>But <i>ESGN</i> is ultimately a step back for a rapper who had worked to increase the variety of his sound and the depth of his subject matter in recent years. In the fashion of the 1990s gangster rap albums Gibbs came up with, <i>ESGN </i>has 20 tracks. That’s over an hour of unyielding, uncompromising music which displays plenty of ability but very little imagination. Gibbs had managed to widen his appeal with tapes like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16024-freddie-gibbs-cold-day-in-hell/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""><i>Cold Day in Hell</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17235-baby-face-killa/"" target=""_blank"">Baby Face Killa</a>, </i>but now he's back working in an incredibly specific space, one that will win him accolades from heads but which can’t help but to be exhausting for anyone who likes a little variety in their rap diet.</p>
<p>Many of the songs on <i>ESGN</i> can be seen as direct repudiation of industry rap, marked as they are by violence, pain, regret and religiosity, all of which are heavily out of fashion at the moment. He refers to the “pussy boys” in the music industry on “Came Up” and then later expands, rapping that he “won’t be a monkey for them crackers like I’m LL” and taking direct shots at Young Jeezy. The sniping comes off both as honest and defensive, Gibbs' simmering resentment at his former label, which he's given voice to in <a href=""http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.24577/title.freddie-gibbs-says-young-jeezy-made-me-look-stupid-/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">multiple</a> <a href=""http://rapradar.com/2013/06/12/freddie-gibbs-calls-out-young-jeezy/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a>, finally finding a musical outlet.</p>
<p>Gibbs is at his absolute technical best on <i>ESGN,</i> and it’s worthwhile to take a closer look at what he does so well. “Eastside Moonwalker”, the title a reference to the most famous Gary native of all time, is a perfect example of the form, Gibbs switching bars and lanes, zooming in to capture specific moments in time and then out again to shit-talk. ""Freddie Soprano"" is a showcase for quickhitting cleverness, with a pop-culture savvy that lends dark comedy to its gangsterisms. Both songs are examples of perfectly regimented rapping, with the shifts in cadence and perfect breath-control of hip-hop formalism inspired by the greats.</p>
<p>Gibbs’ resemblance to his idol <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"" target=""_blank"">Tupac</a> is becoming ever more obvious and the rapper seems to be using his intonation to make the comparisons stick. “I Seen a Man Die” could pass for an extra from the <i>Don Killuminati </i>sessions with its yearning West Coast production and another track, “F.A.M.E.”, includes a spot from the Tha Dogg Pound legend Daz Dillinger. (The track also features Spice 1, the two guests representing a kind of bifurcation of Gibbs’ production sound, which tends to split the difference between Southern and West Coast rap.)</p>
<p>Too often though, Gibbs uses his technical ability and knowledge of rap classics to disguise a lack of substance. Songs like “Lay it Down” contribute nothing but more time to the record: as well-delivered as the lyrics are, the song comes across as dull and unoriginal. The chorus of “9mm” is as tired as the song’s concept, and Gibbs’ insistence on including contributions from anonymous crew members like Hit “Skrewface,” Big Kill, and G-Wiz further implicates Gibbs in his unwillingness to stretch. When all of his cohorts are spitting boilerplate gangster shit, the thinness of subject matter here becomes ever more obvious.</p>
<p>There are slight deviations in sound, all of which are welcome. “Dope in My Styrofoam"" is a breezy, Southern style riding anthem complete with a loop of sampled chorus girls. “Lose Control” features singing from BJ the Chicago Kid that momentarily lightens the mood. There's also plenty of of sterling rap music here that Gibbs fans won't have any issue with: “Hundred Thousand”, “I Seen a Man Die”, ""Have U Seen Her"", “Eastside Moonwalker”, and “Freddie Soprano” are some of Gibbs’ best songs to date, overwhelming displays of rap virtuosity that, had they been released a decade ago, we'd consider classics today. To damn them for being of a kind is to miss the point.</p>
<p>On “Hundred Thousand"", Gibbs supplies a perfect-- and, true to form, concise-- review of <i>ESGN </i>himself. “Ain’t trying to be the man, just trying to maintain.” Callin an album ""more of the same"" sounds dismissive but its something that fans are often happy to receive and there are those for whom 20 tracks of Gibbs rapping nearly perfectly will be enough. But for everyone else, <i>ESGN</i> comes as an unwelcome reversion to the mean. It’s the sound of a rapper more than happy to maintain his narrow lane after being burned by the industry, one who's lost the ambition to leave his comfort zone, at least for the time being.</p></div>"|18272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18272-freddie-gibbs-esgn/|6.9|Jonah Bromwich

Last year’s self-titled collection of singles offered up tech-house (with the emphasis on the “house”) at its most unabashedly pretty, all glittering chime loops and warm basslines, and sometimes even the gentle nourishment of a piano vamp. <i>Blondes</i> ploughed this furrow so intently that it felt like a cohesive statement, and one that it was difficult to imagine the duo adjusting it-- let alone surpassing it-- any time soon.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Follow-up <i>Swisher</i> doesn’t abandon the beauty of the duo’s earlier work (“Andrew” and “Rei” could easily be lifted from last year’s album) but it uses it more judiciously. This shift makes <i>Swisher</i> less immediately captivating but somehow more involving than its predecessor, establishing the ultimate core of the duo’s aesthetic somewhere deeper and altogether more mysterious. How to reconcile the gentle machine-clanking of opener “Aeon”-- like a lost treasure from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/223-selected-ambient-works-85-92/"" target=""_blank"">Selected Ambient Works 85-92</a>--</i> with the frozen expanses of the appropriately-titled “Poland”, or that with the urgent stop-start stalk of “Clasp”, which harkens back to Dettinger at his most ambitious? These tunes are less distant from one another in strict stylistic terms than in function and intention: The underlying dynamic feels slippery and difficult to pin down, but united in its sense of purpose. This shift in tone coincides so closely with the move away from house and towards techno proper that it’s probably pointless to detangle them. </p>
<p>What carries over from the debut to these undeniably colder, more shadowed arrangements is the naturalism of Blondes’ production, pointillist in precision but still organic in feel. At its most steely and forbidding, <i>Swisher</i> aspires to the kind of warmth-in-coldness of Basic Channel, the percussion like tiny blades gently scraping at the surface of your ears, and urgent low drones like locust clouds hovering below eyeshot. “Bora Bora” builds to a torrent of feedback before relaxing into an outro of unexpectedly Latin-infused percussion, and it’s a mark of just how good Blondes are that they can execute transmutations like this so effortlessly and near-imperceptibly. Similarly, the title track creates an entire gas-planet ecosystem of scratching snare patterns, sighing new age synth rushes, and disorienting, bubbling churns, through which a restless <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"" target=""_blank"">Carl Craig</a> arpeggio coalesces like a nascent life form attempting to will itself into existence.</p>
<p>Rounding out <i>Swisher</i> is “Elise”, which threatens to overshadow all that has preceded in its singularity and directness. The kind of winsome, heart-in-mouth epic for which Jürgen Paape or Superpitcher were once beloved, its nagging chime melody, swishing house percussion, and hesitantly flirty bass pulses evoke the human where elsewhere there is only the sentient. If it wasn’t so lovely, it would seem like a cop-out. Instead, it’s a gift, and a reminder of how the familiar emerges out of the foreign, interpersonal meaning out of seemingly meaningless biological process. As myth-making goes, it’s hard to fault.</p></div>"|18261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18261-blondes-swisher/|7.9|Tim Finney

American composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4591-keith-fullerton-whitman/"">Keith Fullerton Whitman</a> deliberately streamlined his process for this split EP with Belgian electronic artist Floris Vanhoof. ""I've been liking the idea more recently of putting out these recordings that are just single ideas,"" he said in a recent <a href=""http://adhoc.fm/post/keith-fullerton-whitman-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. So here we get subtle variations on a theme, spread over four tracks culled from the same modular synth patch. It's tightly controlled work by Whitman's standards, with the first three tracks all barely making it over the three-minute mark. Vanhoof works with similar tools-- essentially a modular set-up he created himself-- but ventures further into the stratosphere, creating a single 19-minute piece full of bleeps and drones. His work is notably softer than Whitman's, providing the balm to his storm.</p>
<p>Music composed within tight parameters, using few chords and a limited sonic palette, often feels meditative or hypnotic (or both). <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/880-holger-czukay/"">Holger Czukay</a>'s bass in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>'s imposing ""Yoo Doo Right"" almost has the same pacifying qualities as a children's lullaby in the quieter portions of the song. Whitman doesn't take that route here, instead choosing to see how many sharp corners he can bump into with the tools at his disposal. His first three tracks are wrapped up in a form of deterioration, driven by rhythms that barely follow logical patterns, manic analog synthesis, and blocky electronic forms that sputter into malformed life. At times it feels like he's antagonizing his equipment to the point of pain, looking for that peculiar spot where machines appear to make very human responses.</p>
<p>Despite tendencies toward decay, there's nothing here as overtly confrontational as, say, ""Occlusion (Rue de Bitche)"" from Whitman's 2012 record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16794-occlusions/""><i>Occlusions</i></a>. Instead, much of this material reaches for a warmer, brighter space, typified by the lightly criss-crossing patterns of ""Automatic Drums With Melody"". It makes for a neat outward juxtaposition to Vanhoof's single contribution, which plunges far deeper into introspection. Whitman says the two met when Vanhoof toured with the ultra-tranquil <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30244-dolphins-into-the-future/"">Dolphins into the Future</a>, whose undersea take on New Age tropes is in a vaguely similar orbit. His ""De Karekiet van Karakas"" is all deeply pulsing oscillations pitched against light trickles of machine noise, forming a track so abyssal it creates an abstract world all of its own, where the music speaks its own strange language.</p>
<p>So the bond between Whitman and Vanhoof's work stretches far beyond their similar interest in primitive electronics. Both reach a point where aspects of the physical world seep into their sound. For Vanhoof, elements are pulled from the animal kingdom, sometimes overtly in the form of noises that resemble sea life, but more interestingly when the shapes he creates resemble a peculiar type of life of their own. Tiny figures loop and flourish then fade, like amoebas fluttering momentarily into life. Whitman appears concerned with making the equipment itself bleed out, poking and prodding at it until the response is somewhere more personal than the standard man-machine interface. There’s overlap here for sure, but both artists find singular moments of beauty from each vantage point.</p></div>"|18171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18171-keith-fullerton-whitman-floris-vanhoof-split-lp/|6.8|Nick Neyland

Parting ways with drummer Seb Rochford-- with whom he continues to play in Polar Bear-- Wareham brings along bassist Ruth Goller for this frenetic dance-music project, whose fast, fleet lines have more to do with world pop and funk, particularly African, than jazz, recalling a globalized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/916-chk-chk-chk/"">!!!</a>. Rounded out by tenor saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings, vocalist Kushal Gaya of art-funk terrors Zun Zun Egui, and dual percussionists Tom Skinner and Satin Singh, Melt Yourself Down's debut is direct and infectious, jostling with harmonic and rhythmic allusions to Nubia, the Middle East, Latin America. If this makes the album sound dizzyingly diverse, that's half-right.    </p>
<p><i>Melt Yourself Down</i> is definitely dizzying; a whirling dervish that only relents for a couple mellower numbers tucked away at the end, where Gaya sings passionately rather than scatter-bombing panicky chants and hiccups in a mix of French Creole, English, and gibberish. ""Free Walk"" is especially notable for its intricate finger-work on the drums, so richly textured that it's more of a sensation than a sound in the ears. But generally, the different world music strains to adhere to a similar plan of attack. Apt for a record named after an obscure import by James White &amp; the Blacks, most songs are driven by peppered, serpentine sax motifs that double each other, slither off on maniacal flights, and rejoin in unison. They're buoyed by melodically burbling hand percussion and ballasted by compactly looping bass lines. The careening music is tightly played; a precision offset by the primitive electronic palette of producer Leafcutter John, who adds filter snaps, blurts of synthesizer, and dubby echoes.</p>
<p>Though repetitive, the record is consistently engaging, with plenty of distinct highlights. The saxes on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14860-fix-my-life/"">""Fix My Life""</a> alternate between bristling junkyard riffs and a celebratory unison chorus so redolent of '80s pop radio you almost expect to hear Whitney Houston or Lionel Richie start singing. On the percolating <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15309-melt-yourself-down-release/"">""Release!""</a>, the notched line of Goller's bass holds together a shuddering web of sub-rhythms in the scribbling horns and electronics.  It's about halfway through, circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14488-we-are-enough/"">""We are Enough""</a>, when it starts to feel as if we’ve already heard everything Melt Yourself Down has to offer, though they rally for a varied three-song finish culminating in ""Camel"", a big-footed stomp that trades lunging speed for humped mass. The music is optimal for a live setting, where Gaya is liable to fling himself into the audience, spinning like a top. But the record's narrow straits course with such ebullient energy that it's easy to get swept up in the fun these players are clearly having.</p></div>"|18118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18118-melt-yourself-down-melt-yourself-down/|6.4|Brian Howe

Albums like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15566-electronic-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Electronic Dream</a> </i>and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17697-araabmuzik-for-professional-use-only/"" target=""_blank"">For Professional Use Only</a> </i>took an approach to beat-extending, break-isolating mixing that goes back four decades, and drew out some of the moodier, wilder elements of his source material using the oldest trick in the hip-hop book: repossessing the entire intent of a song by isolating one specific stretch of it.</p>
<p>So much of the material that AraabMuzik's been dealing with over the past few years, from arena dubstep to pop-chart trance, rides on peaks-and-valleys successions of build-ups to bombastic peaks. AraabMuzik's mutation of that dynamic into a steady, prolonged all-peaks churn is the key: who says you have to <i>wait</i> for the drop? In that sense, <i>The Remixes Vol. 1 </i>isn't significantly different than his previous records' approaches. There's more of a feel of “official” business to it; much of the source material comes from the Ultra Music label and skews closer to the Electric Daisy Carnival aesthetic than anything AraabMuzik's worked with to date. But that's the closest there is to a unifying background to <i>The Remixes</i>, which really does make his own choppily momentous, joyously abrasive, and widely sourced sense of rhythm the biggest common denominator.</p>
<p>Mt. Eden's “Sierra Leone” is a sort of mission statement. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16bRiH5zfOY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In its original form</a>, it's as steadily composed and fluid as wobbly bass anthems get, a balanced split between hard bombast and billowy emotion that might sound like a maximalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> if you stripped out all the wubs. Which is just what AraabMuzik does at the outset, juicing it up with orchestra hits and rearranging the beat so it's more distinctly hip-hop-friendly. And once the wobble-bass <i>does </i>get dropped in, it's more of a rumbling shudder than the hyperactive hiccups in the original. Further elements of AraabMuzik's style show up in more transformative moments, like the nearly from-scratch rebuild of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6p5W30BV1U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wolfgang Gartner's Omarion-featuring “Still My Baby”</a>. That cut revamps its tweaky electro house chords into a more spread-out melody that stalks like a 1980s slasher-flick villain over a more traditional house 4/4, then unexpectedly disintegrates into a puddle of rattling snares that make a point of proving why the best trap comes from a miles-deep hip-hop grounding.</p>
<p>Not that <i>The Remixes Vol. 1 </i>pins him to any genre constraints. Style trumps niche every time here, and in its efficiently compact sub-hour runtime there's plenty of opportunity to let that style run through all kind of territory. His take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"" target=""_blank"">Skrillex</a>'s omnipresent remix of Benny Benassi's “Cinema” cuts to the chase, as AraabMuzik lets that hyperventilating gatling-laser drop loop for long enough to make its overamped malfunctioning slot-machine spasm feel as simple and immediate as the “Ante Up” horns. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5636-steve-aoki/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Aoki</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8562-kid-cudi/"" target=""_blank"">Kid Cudi</a>/Travis Barker collab “Cudi the Kid” is saved from its flabby trance-n-bass excess with a slick minor-key pitch shift and a regrouping around a martial, mid-tempo slice of breakbeat. It's ambitious recontextualization, even if it gets away from him a little: another Gartner cut, “Cognitive Dissonance”, lives up to the title with some abrupt borderline-trainwreck swings from electro to boom-bap that would work together as individual pieces. And his soulful remix of Taana Gardner's 81 b-boy disco staple “Heartbeat” sticks out amidst all this top-dollar superclub material like a banana-seat Schwinn Sting-Ray at the Tour de France, though it's no big dealbreaker when the worst thing you can say about a mix selection is that it makes you wish he'd do an old-school all-West End Records set.</p>
<p>But the real thread here, characteristically enough, is mood. AraabMuzik's always had a tendency to twist even the most euphoric hands-up moments of EDM crowdpleasers into something more overcast and ambivalent, and that's what continues to keep his material compelling. It's easy to hear the excitement and flashiness in his beats, but there's just enough restraint and lingering darkness that it's like siphoning all the gloss off candy paint or replacing neon with flourescent lights. Turning big drops into hypnotic loops, ditching crescendos for churn, programming and manipulating beats that shudder restlessly in otherwise Swiss-timing rhythmic constraints-- this isn't simple edit work, it's an entire tonal shift. That said, there are two original cuts here. One is closer “Keep it in Motion”, a showcase for NoLa rapper Chase N. Cashe that, while a pretty straightforward money-flinging door-kicker with the MC on it, shows up earlier as an instrumental that reveals some tense, icy arpeggios driving those chattering snares. The other one's a sparse number featuring bleary, slowly floating chords and near-subliminal mournful choir vocals. The title? “Darkside”. Just so you know where he's coming from.</p></div>"|18267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18267-araabmuzik-the-remixes-vol-1/|7.2|Nate Patrin

Deep into his fifties, he hasn’t lost a beat or slowed down a bit, but instead churns out album after album after EP after one-off solo thing after album. Already in 2013 he has released a new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"">Guided by Voices</a> album, a full-length under his Teenage Guitar pseudonym, a singles box set, and a 12”, with who knows what all else planned for the next six months. It’s been this way for decades now, such that Pollard’s chief trait as an artist is the frequency of his output. Consequently, it’s all too easy to forget that he’s not just a prolific songwriter, but a good songwriter, too. Indie rock’s own Joyce Carol Oates possesses an insanely deep vocabulary of classic-rock tropes, a facility with killer hooks, and an idiosyncratic lyrical style that has matured to reveal new depths of wisdom, humor, and harrumphing crotchetiness.</p>
<p>It should surprise exactly no-one that <i>Honey Locust Honky Tonk</i> is a good record: Even at his most unedited and undigested, Pollard’s music still displays a joy in its own resourcefulness, a contentment in its own faith in the power of rock and roll to define a life. In other words, every release is worth spinning at least once. But it should surprise everyone that <i>Honey Locust Honky Tonk</i> is a <i>very</i> good record, his best and most focused in quite some time. One byproduct of his prolific nature is a constant flattening out of his catalog, so that everything, especially at this end of his career, begins to blur together; the highs never seem quite so exciting anymore, the lows no longer quite so embarrassing, and very little stands out as essential. That any particular release stands out at all is by now a small miracle.</p>
<p>Pollard’s dedication to the form has always been impressive, and he has remained largely untouched-- or unperturbed, or uncompelled-- by outside forces or trends in rock and roll. Instead, he has burrowed deeper and deeper into his beloved classic rock and has somehow managed to find new modes of expression in this tiny realm of music. “Circus Green Machine” builds on great bursts of acoustic guitar power chords that sound like Pete Townshend is about to spin a yarn, while “Strange and Pretty Day”, the album’s lowest-fi recording, nods to Skip Spence or maybe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1356-roky-erickson/"">Roky Erickson </a>with its insistent one-note piano theme. By this point, Pollard has even become his own reference point: Scuff up the sound a bit and “Airs” or “Igloo Hearts” wouldn’t be out of place on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3600-bee-thousand-the-directors-cut/""><i>Bee Thousand </i></a>or <i>Alien Lanes.</i></p>
<p>Even if it’s not hard to imagine a 30-something Pollard penning these new tunes, <i>Honey Locust Honky Tonk</i> nevertheless sounds like the work of a man with some years and experience behind him. There’s some polish on the melodies, a new forthrightness in the lyrics. And by forthright, I mean how he repeats the pretzel-logic line, “We may never not know,” ad infinitum on “It Disappears in the Least Likely Hands (We May Never Not Know)” and still makes it sound somehow poignant. There’s always been an odd melancholy to Pollard’s music, but there’s a peculiar gravity to the psych-rockin’ “Her Eyes Play Tricks on the Camera” and the country-rockin’ “I Killed a Man Who Looks Like You”. A desperate gregariousness pervades the 44-second toast “I Have to Drink” and surely informs the camp-choir sing-along that ends “Real Fun Is No One’s Monopoly”.</p>
<p>The guitars on <i>Honey Locust Honky Tonk</i> can be sluggish at times, especially during the more cumbersome anthems, and the tracklist could stand some pruning. But these are perennial complaints, excusable for being bound up among his many eccentricities, and Pollard compensates with what seems like a greater sense of mission. Mortality looms over <i>Honey Locust Honky Tonk, </i>explicitly defining songs like “Who Buries the Undertaker” while implicitly informing fragments like “Shielding Whatever Needs You”. Rather than dour, however, the album sounds concerned, perhaps even worried, which illuminates even some of its weaker or seemingly extraneous tracks. It focuses Pollard, who sounds like a man who has said so much already but still has so much left to say.</p></div>"|18249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18249-robert-pollard-honey-locust-honky-tonk/|7.4|Stephen M.

Even as an early adopter of the once-trendy witch house’s echoing hysterics, Dexter’s music always sounded best when love was involved and there was someone there to help drive that stake through his heart. His earlier solo work was easily lumped in with the subgenre he refused to associate with, but with the help of vocalists (and compelling vocal samples), oOoOO has always sounded like something bigger than a fad.</p>
<p>With his debut full-length, Dexter’s ear for dramatics is stronger than ever. He hasn’t strayed from the dimly lit brooding that took over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14674-ooooo-ep/""><i>oOoOO</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16462-ooooo-our-love-is-hurting-us-ep/""><i>Our Love Is Hurting Us</i></a>, but in the years since his style has moved out of the spotlight, the musician has figured out what he wants to do with it: go pop. He’s mentioned a local train outside of his apartment window as inspiration while working on the album, saying that the clattering on the tracks stopped him from dozing off. That dynamic is key here: Much of this album is a haze that sucks you in only to push back out when the listener comes too close to being enveloped in its cloudiness.</p>
<p>Where Dexter's catalog has a tendency to quicksand around drone-like samples, the production on <i>Without Your Love</i> is more focused than it’s ever been. On “Misunderstood”, one of <i>Without Your Love</i>’s strongest tracks, the bass is enunciated as a wind of muted synths sprawl in the background; once you start wondering whether or not the climatic waves of chopped vocals crooning “Maybe you misunderstood” is a Brandy snippet from “Boy Is Mine”, you’ll be doomed to listen to the song on repeat. But it’s here where Dexter's R&amp;B flair comes through; when his vocal manipulations are as strong as his production technique. “Stay Here” harkens back to <i>Our Love Is Hurting Us</i>’ “Break Yr Heartt”, and “Without Your Love” is practically cheery.</p>
<p>There’s no way to avoid the gloom though, and with it, the witchy, goth tropes to which oOoOO has invited assocation. With the album being released on Dexter’s own Night Feelings, he’s undoubtedly trying to break out of that mold. But the dark, gut-flipping menace pulls through despite the cleaner production. “Crossed Wires” is a staticky call from some sort of haunted monastery, warped chanting and all. “Mouchette” floats airy croons and waves of synths over a fantastic hammering of industrial reverb. “The South” takes another route, blending stuttering beats and flying wails into a trap instrumental that could easily host a rapper or two.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if oOoOO has larger pop aspirations, or if he’s making tracks with vocalists to play with the idea of straight R&amp;B or rap production. If nothing else, songs like “Across the Sea”, with its sauntering groove, melodic keys, and pitched-down vocals do feel like an ambitious go at indie-pop songwriting. Still, the ideas on <i>Without Your Love</i> are a little too disparate to indicate what he’s getting at. The sequencing helps, making a story out of songs that would otherwise feel uncomfortably out of sorts. But while, overall, this is the strongest collection we’ve seen from oOoOO, it’s still difficult to tell what direction he’s trying to lead us in. <i>Without Your Love</i> ends up becoming a loose survey of Dexter's work instead the Nihjgt Feelings statement he intended it to be.</p></div>"|18217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18217-ooooo-without-your-love/|6.7|Puja Patel

It's become hard to pin them down them at this point. They don't appear to have many peers, or even particularly care about anything going on around them. It's easy to imagine them locked away in their Ocropolis studio in Brooklyn, falling ever further into the cycles of repetition that gather around them like an impenetrable force whenever they play. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28796-people-of-the-north/"">People of the North</a> is a side project from Oneida's Kid Millions and Bobby Matador, a duo now onto their third album together, and their first for <a href=""http://thrilljockey.com/splash.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thrill Jockey</a>. <i>Sub Contra</i> picks up where they left off on last year’s <i>Steep Formations</i>, even bringing in the same guests, Shahin Motia and Barry London. It's a short set of instrumental jams with a purposeful looseness in the playing, often underpinned by a sense of gloom that loosely ties it to the last couple of Oneida records.</p>
<p>The Ocropolis appears key in the making of this album and much of Millions and Matador's other works. Unshackled from the burden of recording against the clock and with no need to keep an eye on per-hour rates, it feels like they dug far deeper into the music. It's difficult to picture <i>Sub Contra</i> coming out the way it has if they hadn't unlocked those freedoms. That liberation has brought them to a curious spot here, one that's somewhere between fully formed ideas and first-thought improvisation. Millions is one of the tightest drummers in the business when he wants to be, but on People of the North records he prefers a more scattershot approach, sometimes appearing completely absorbed in his own world. For the twin ""Sub Contra 1"" and ""Sub Contra 2"" he skews into jazzy fills, lightly playing around the exhaust-fume drones that char away at the center of the suite.</p>
<p>What's most interesting about <i>Sub Contra</i> is the interplay between the two players and the guests they bring in. Sometimes it's tight, focused, locked into the same vision. At other times they wander off on individual tangents, only to slowly drag each other back to the same point. ""Coal Baron"" is easily the highlight of the former work, with its glassy ambient textures mirroring the more reflective work of krautrock bands such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a>. Krautrock has long been a touchstone for Oneida, but mostly the driving, fiercely hypnotic side of the genre. ""Coal Baron"" is People of the North getting in touch with gentler patterns, subtly tracing out its rhythms through tiny organ figures and trance-y loops. In contrast, the closing 14-minute ""Osage Orange"" demonstrates their wayward side, with Millions coming perilously close to performing a drum solo before nailing it down into a harmonious place at its close.</p>
<p>The shifts in style from <i>Sub Contra</i> further enforce the sense of near limitless flexibility and detachment that surrounds the guys in Oneida. Sometimes this feels like a glimpse into their studio process, resembling a 40-minute snippet of tape cut from a few lengthy workouts that no doubt stretched long into the night. But there's a passion here that gives it more value than that, a feeling that this is something they're compelled to do regardless of how accepting the outside world is to it. <i>Sub Contra</i> is a limited edition of just 500 vinyl copies, something for devoted followers to chew on during the (likely very brief) time before these guys embark on something else. But there's no air of exclusivity here. In fact, it's quite the opposite. People of the North is a project that’s all about openness, about laying processes bare, about welcoming people in to what would otherwise be a very private moment.</p></div>"|18203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18203-people-of-the-north-sub-contra/|6.5|Nick Neyland

<p>Since 2007, the members of West Coast post-punk trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28983-grass-widow/"" target=""_blank"">Grass Widow</a> have exuded a group dynamic so seamless their otherworldly three-part harmonies and disjointed melodies sound effortless. But such grace doesn’t come easily. In line with the kind of radical politics pushed around their hometown of San Francisco, Grass Widow proudly self-identify as a leaderless band with a democratic songwriting process. When that type of consensus decision-making works, it’s beautiful. But consensus is never an easy process: individuals often end up making compromises to accommodate the shared values of the group as a whole. With her solo project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31310-ruby-pins/"" target=""_blank"">Ruby Pins</a>, Grass Widow drummer/singer Lillian Maring has stepped away from those limitations to spend time inside her own head and embrace her darker creative impulses. The result, written over three years and self-recorded with a laptop and one microphone, is a haunting collection of cryptic pop songs.</p>
<p>Maring’s autonomous vision shines through its abstractions; through its way of shaping spooked moods with heavy, cyclical drumbeats, shadowy surf riffs, and enigmatic wordless vocal hooks. Like in Grass Widow, the vocals on <i>Ruby Pins</i> are consistently low in the mix, veiled by home-recording hiss, making space for Maring’s psychedelic guitars and spiraling keys to sing the stories just as much as her voice does. Sometimes, Maring self-harmonizes for double-tracked parts, deadpanning like a girl-gang of one (“Gagging on the Obvious”) while at other points she sings woozy pop melodies (“Lost Art”). The words are rarely audible, but it always sounds like she’s trying to tell us something.</p>
<p>The album starts with the dim and distant chugging riffs of “Chariot”, an opener that sounds like a moving vehicle racing away. “My Friends Are Insane” could be a sketch pulled from Maring’s diary; her words are urgently plainspoken over echoes of murky instrumentals. “Girl Store” is similarly arcane and downcast, a collage of what sounds like recorded conversations pieced together. A recurring high-pitched voice sounds like a little girl lost in a toy store: “ha ha ha,” she hums over shuffling circus-like percussion. “Begotten” contains barely any lyrics, but is one of the most entrancing tracks on side B; a nightmarish four-minute jam that starts out with a mess of indecipherable words drowned out by a meandering minor-chord guitar line and speeding percussion. It'd make a good soundtrack for a haunted fun house.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href=""http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/grass-widows-chameleon/Content?oid=3577183"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview with<i> East Bay Express</i></a> surrounding the release of <i>Ruby Pins</i>, Maring slowly unveiled some of the heavy baggage she was dragging around while writing lines like, “No day is the right day to die/ No day is the right day to die” on ""Chameleon"". In 2010, she lost her boyfriend to cancer, and writing <i>Ruby Pins</i> was one way of grieving. While it's hard to forget such a tragic story, it’s also not entirely necessary to know in order to sense the surreal, ever-present gloom of <i>Ruby Pins</i>. In fact, the obscured lyrics (the record doesn’t come with a lyric sheet) almost prevent Maring's personal life from driving the narrative of her debut. It further proves, though, that the most intrinsically human records are ones an artist makes entirely for herself.</p>

Two years later, both rappers have new solo albums that expound on the distinction. Kanye infamously proclaimed “I Am a God” on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank"">Yeezus</a></i>; you could either gape in awe or call it heresy, but you couldn’t doubt his conviction. And just as the brutal and blasphemous <i>Yeezus</i> is true to its title, <i>Magna Carta…Holy Grail</i> offers a jumbled juxtaposition of the regal and divine-- hear Jay-Z gasp “You in the presence of a king/ Scratch that, you in the presence of a god” on “Crown”. It's one of the few lines here that scans as wishful thinking. The album is a celebration of unlimited financial privilege and power that even used its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51392-riaa-changes-gold-and-platinum-rules-due-to-jay-zs-magna-carta-holy-grail"" target=""_blank"">literally game-changing release as a Samsung Galaxy app</a> to separate Jay-Z’s fans into haves and have-nots. Only a small subset could acquire <i>Magna Carta Holy Grail </i>on its release date, and it seems safe to say that fewer still will relate to it in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Which is problematic, since here the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-6_WMgmphs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“voice of the young people”</a> seems bent on addressing the public. “I ball so hard on ESPN/ See my name come across CNN/ About six minutes you gonna see it again,” he later claims on “Crown”. Between his newborn daughter, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50258-jay-z-in-process-of-selling-his-share-of-brooklyn-nets-in-order-to-become-basketball-agent/"">budding sports agency</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50233-two-members-of-congress-investigating-beyonce-and-jay-zs-trip-to-cuba/"">political controversies</a>, and his equally famous wife, <i>Magna Carta </i>has the most personal material to work with since <i>The Black Album. </i>But the songs rarely go deep. On “Picasso Baby”, Jay boasts “House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern/ Because I be goin’ ape at the auction.” I doubt he meant it to be <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZAR4z8uyq0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Poppin’ Tags”</a> for the Sotheby’s set-- a vulgar display of net worth that puts him in the tax bracket of shipping magnates and NBA owners-- but it comes across as a context and appraisal-free recitation of famous names, a Winner’s History of Modern Art.</p>
<p>The same can be said of the collaborators. Like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17736-justin-timberlake-the-2020-experience/"">The 20/20 Experience</a>, </i>the latest album from his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49659-jay-z-and-justin-timberlake-detail-their-summer-stadium-tour-legends-of-the-summer/"">Legends of the Summer</a> tourmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/"">Justin Timberlake</a>, <i>Magna </i>is a hedge-betting, black-tie/Black Card affair that’s not just an account of luxury, but an accessory to it. Marquee names <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland"">Timbaland</a>, Swizz Beatz, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell"">Pharrell</a>, Timberlake, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas"">Nas</a> all lend their talents-- and <i>all </i>appear on “BBC”. The money isn't totally wasted, as these are some of the stranger beats Jay’s rapped over in some time. Witness the contorted, metallic pings of “Tom Ford”, “Somewhereinamerica”’s drunken ragtime horns, or the codeine-laced, dubby “Crown”. Jay is at least trying to interact with a hip-hop mainstream that has evolved a great deal since his last true solo album, though <span>relegating the production of reigning MVP Mike Will Made It to a one-minute interlude (""Beach Is Better"") smacks of unintended elitism. </span></p>
<p>At its best, <i>Magna</i> is a record that only a 43-year-old Jay-Z could make. “Heaven” is the most thought-provoking spiritual meditation he’s written, and the willful misreading of “Losing My Religion” is used to powerful effect. “Jay-Z Blue” ruminates on the responsibilities and cyclical pathologies of fatherhood with warmth and self-doubt rather than the bitterness that marked what had previously been his most family-minded LP, <i>The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. </i>But Jay also manifests a worst case scenario for “dad-rap.” Twelve albums in, he’s still Muhammad Ali, he’s Michael Jackson, he’s Michael Jordan, he’s Frank Sinatra-- the latter is the most deflating comparison, if only because Jay-Z is using him as a prop for yet another lyric about how he did it “my way.” As tedious as these hoary references can be, it's worse when <i>Magna Carta </i>dabbles in contemporary name-drops and Jay-Z becomes Jay Leno-- mentions of <i>Homeland, </i>Instagram, Scott Boras, and Miley Cyrus’ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUvu1mlWco"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">twerkin’ incident</a> bomb like failed monologue jokes between idle chatter.</p>
<p>Unlike <i>Watch the Throne, </i>Jay-Z lacks a foil to bring out an emotional or sociological underpinning, someone to help <i>Magna Carta</i> resonate beyond <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2013/03/james-franco-spring-breakers-speech.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“look at my shit.”</a> Timberlake is in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MbwMu139nc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“my name is Bob and I work at my job”</a> mode during the laughably overblown <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51413-listen-jay-z-holy-grail-ft-justin-timberlake"">“Holy Grail""</a>, cycling through every tortured artist cliché short of a crucifixion metaphor. And as bad as the “Smells Like Teen Spirit” interpolation reads on paper, once you hear JT and Jay-Z duet on “and we all just entertainers/ And we’re stupid and contagious,” the Nirvana song becomes just another forgettable status symbol. And where Kurt Cobain felt compromised by his fame, Jay and Timberlake are doing everything in their power not to offend the money people-- whether it’s Samsung, Target, or someone dropping $250 to see them at the Rose Bowl. </p>
<p>Jay-Z rapping about the incomprehensible awesomeness of his life is nothing new, and the corporate synergy is hardly a novelty: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4219-the-black-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Black Album </i></a>doubled as a retirement party, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9647-kingdom-come/""><i>Kingdom Come </i></a>was launched by a Budweiser commercial, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10879-american-gangster/""><i>American Gangster </i></a>coincided with a Hollywood blockbuster of the same name, and, in hindsight, <i>Blueprint 3 </i>was made with full knowledge that Jay-Z would be Coachella’s first hip-hop headliner. He’s a businessman <i>and </i>a business, man. After all, while Samsung shelled out seven figures for exclusive access to the Jay-Z brand, Shawn Carter was the guy signing the contract and cashing the check. But the best of those joint ventures seemed determined to reach a new audience and create a connection. The weirdly distant and safe <i>Magna Carta Holy Grail </i>abides by the tried and true business principle that the customer is always right: you just have to remember who the customer is here. </p></div>"|18247.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18247-jay-z-magna-carta-holy-grail/|5.8|Ian Cohen

This recording of a headline show by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a> at 2012's <a href=""http://www.bestival.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bestival</a> on the Isle of Wight offers plenty of moments that don't necessarily sit well-- Bernard Sumner bellowing ""come on!"" in the middle of a stadium-ized version of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"", the inclusion of non-classic era songs ""Krafty"" and ""Here to Stay"", the absence of Peter Hook on bass. But if you trace their history it's clear that the stoic image they partly cultivated has gradually loosened and fallen away as the years have passed, sometimes becoming distinctly at odds with the impeccable Peter Saville sleeves and Factory marketing acumen of yore. This is, after all, a group that chose to perform on the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2RFmKmkEr4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Baywatch set</a> when invited to play ""Regret"" on Top of the Pops in 1993.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What's remarkable about New Order circa 2013 is the amount of good will that continues to flow toward them despite their obvious flaws. Hook is gone, Sumner has often seemed disinterested in the band, it's arguably been 20 years since they penned anything like a good song, and this is their third go-around following a 2011 reunion with an altered lineup. Yet, listen to the version of ""Blue Monday"" here and you can hear the (no doubt huge) crowd faithfully singing along at times, turning it into an unlikely festival anthem. They sound comfortable in this space, and so they should. Their notable festival appearances are legion at this time, arguably beginning with a headline slot at the 1989 Reading Festival, which played a big part in transforming that event from a parade of has-beens into something approaching vitality (Starship of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydOB-YNJ8Jw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now""</a> fame topped the bill the previous year).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The question of whether Hook is missed is somewhat moot. His basslines are played impeccably by Tom Chapman, for the most part. But Hook's presence was always a key part of their makeup, a flash of dirt and menace to counteract Sumner’s boyish exterior. It's possible that Hook’s leather trouser act no longer befits someone of his years, but still it's probably better that this is being released as an audio document as opposed to a visual one. We're also spared the sight of Sumner's erratic performance, with his voice sometimes comically strained (horribly so in ""True Faith"") or sounding like he's out of breath (""Bizarre Love Triangle""). But New Order were rarely ever a slick machine live, and mostly </span><i>Live at Bestival</i><span> highlights the shortcomings of documenting them in such a light; what once might have been drunk, celebratory fun sounds distinctly less so in the cold, sober light of day.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is a charity album, released to aid the <a href=""http://www.iowyouthtrust.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Isle of Wight Youth Trust</a>, and as such it's a commendable venture. Still, its placing in the New Order discography is hardly likely to be significant, especially as the <i>Live at the London Troxy </i>album from 2011 already documented this incarnation of the group in a live setting (and with a similar tracklisting). There's a certain joy to be found in them tearing through ""Regret""-- a song that always seemed designed for such cavernous surroundings-- or hearing them stretch out a 10-minute-plus version of ""Temptation"". It's when they turn to smaller moments that things backfire, such as the decidedly unsure steps taken through the opening ""Elegia"", reduced here to a runtime of less than three minutes, which feels especially puny following the release of the 17-and-a-half minute version on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5766-retro-box-set/""><i>Retro</i></a> box set.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Live at Bestival</i> won't tear anyone away from the riveting <i>Taras Shevchenko</i> live video from 1981, but it's still hard not to crack a smile at how corny Bernard Sumner can be on occasion. His between-song banter is the sound of someone utterly comfortable with what his group have become, a veteran festival headline act happy to work through the hits. It's about as far away as you can get from the multiple shades of black that cloaked the original <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a> songs liberally sprinkled throughout the setlist, but there's a strong sense of vindication in the robust vigor of ""Transmission"", a feeling that this music was always destined to connect to an audience far beyond those who first claimed it. Sumner's almost certainly having far too much fun to care either way. ""Cheers, thank you Bestival,"" he says at the close of the set. ""What a great festival. It's the best... festival.""</p></div>"|18246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18246-new-order-live-at-bestival-2012/|6.4|Nick Neyland

Maybe it’s because along with the first few waves of Chicago house it formed the basis for the entire form, and because it’s never been overexposed via car ads or rock musicians briefly reinventing themselves as “electronica” artists. But there’s also something simply aesthetically perfect about the style: minimalist and dark and, when it’s executed well, really hard to imagine as improvable in any way. It’s like the sonic equivalent of the black band t-shirt.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"">Carl Craig</a> has come closer than any other artist to locating the style’s aesthetic ideal, the sweet spot between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>’s organically icy machine music and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1505-funkadelic/"">Funkadelic</a>’s deeply human funk exploration that remain its two most essential influences. His entry in the Ministry of Sound’s Masterpiece series of mixes by ground-laying dance music pioneers is not only a great trilogy of three CD-length sets, but something like a self-portrait or an autobiography in sound, and an intriguing look into the mind of a master musician.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Disc one, titled “Aspiration”, is meant to be a 70-minute sample of what he’s up to these days as a DJ. It leads off with “Zug Island”, a 2012 single by Detroit natives Kyle Hall &amp; Kero, and named after a blighted, heavily industrialized man-made island in the most polluted part of the city. In true Detroit minimalist fashion it consists of little more than a pattern of noisy drums, an ambiently beeping bell-tone synthesizer, and another synth repeating a three-note bassline. It’s a ridiculously simple arrangement, but fascinating to hear as the sounds begin to evolve, with delays dropping in and out and the bassline mutating from a gentle throb to an acid-house freakout. The sounds are modern, but it’s also a perfect representation of the aesthetic philosophy on which techno was founded.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For the remainder of “Aspiration”, Craig shifts seamlessly back and forth between stark minimalism and more lushly elaborate (by comparison) sounds. Many of the contributions come from newer artists working in the Detroit style, but there are also excursions into house-ier stuff, and a brief glimpse at one of Craig’s influences through the inclusion of Egyptian Lover’s 1984 world-shaker “Egypt Egypt”.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The second mix, “Inspiration”, is a more thorough exploration of the music Craig’s been affected by. Some it’s the kind of stuff you might expect him to cite: fellow techno artists of the old school like Derrick May, e-Dancer, and Moritz von Oswald. Other inclusions are more eye-opening. There’s experimental reggae from African Head Charge and digital dancehall originator King Jammy. There’s R&amp;B from DeBarge and Erykah Badu. There’s a track from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15999-david-lynch-crazy-clown-time/"">David Lynch</a>’s 2011 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15999-david-lynch-crazy-clown-time/"" target=""_blank""><i>Crazy Clown Time</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5547-freeway/"" target=""_blank"">Freeway</a>’s “All My Life,” and a bossa nova-influenced track from Melody Gardot. Muddy Waters’ “Mannish Boy”, the Temptations’ psychedelic-era “Cloud Nine”, and the organ-heavy proto-hard rock cut “In the Jungle” by the Motown-signed group the Messengers represent a fuzzed-out, loose-limbed approach to making music that’s difficult to see reflected in Craig’s own work.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If “Aspiration” and “Inspiration” are Craig surveying his present and past, the final disc finds him looking forward, staking out new stylistic territory and proving that after almost 25 years of recording he’s still evolving as an artist. “Meditation” is a suite of six new, original compositions for modular synthesizer that explore a much different side to Carl Craig than we’re used to seeing. As the title indicates, they’re the result of directing his talents for bare-bones arrangement and selecting fascinatingly dark sonic palettes to ends that are far more suited to contemplation than dancing.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The sounds of his modular synthesizer setup invite comparisons to synth wizards of the past like Vangelis, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a>, and John Carpenter, but the way he uses it is bracingly original and often daring. The individual tracks, most of them coming in around the 10-minute mark, drift between downtempo but danceable songs that hint at techno and Italo disco on one hand, and on the other pure, trance-inducing ambience. The former kind are rewarding, and offer the unique sort of pleasure that comes from hearing an accomplished artist working with a different set of tools to normal, but the ambient stuff is even more fascinating.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It makes sense that one of the modern masters of minimalist composition would be able to apply his talents successfully to a style that’s historically compatible with bare-bones arrangements, and the end results exceed expectations. They’re richly textured despite their sonic sparsity, and full of the energy that separates ambient music that engages the listener’s mind from the kind that just puts them to sleep. It’s so engaging, in fact, that at one point Craig pulls down everything in the mix until there’s only a deep, throbbing bass tone that you can only hear on headphones or a halfway decent set of speakers. </span>The really tricky part of it is that you might very well find yourself pulled so far into it that you don’t even notice the missing instruments until they come back in minutes later. It’s a master-level maneuver that underlines the essential theme of the three-disc set, which is that after a quarter century of pushing music into the future, Carl Craig’s still not done.</p></div>"|18097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18097-carl-craig-masterpiece/|7.3|Miles Raymer

Even the ""electronic"" tag doesn't entirely fit at times-- core members Andi Toma and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31340-jan-st-werner/"">Jan St. Werner</a>'s respective backgrounds are as a guitarist and a drummer, and their live shows often feature the charismatic Dodo NKishi behind the trap set. St. Werner has made solo recordings under various guises before, but here he steps out under his own name for the first time, again blurring perceptions and stretching at definitions of his working method. This is the inaugural release in the Fiepblatter series for <a href=""http://thrilljockey.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thrill Jockey</a>, which will focus on field recordings, improvisational works, and other elements drawn from the margins of sound.</p>
<p><i>Blaze Colour Burn</i> is a suitably amorphous statement of intent for this proposed set of releases, principally because it's a series of fractured recordings that are as much about what's happening around the sounds as the sounds themselves. The two-part ""Spiazzacorale"" has been edited down from an eight-hour live performance in Italy, and is frequently punctured by audience movement, a low-lying conversational murmur, and other crowd noise. At one point it appears to collapse altogether, only for St. Werner to bring it back in a burst of brilliant color via the sound of a traditional Umbrian band. It's far from the studied work of Mouse on Mars, replacing that band's strictures with a looseness that feels freeing. The non-live material works that way too-- ""Sipian Organ"" acts like an industrialized take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>'s ambient works, oscillating between quiet background drones and sharp, metallic foreground noise.</p>
<p>The amount of space in the recording is key, sometimes causing it to resemble a performance happening far off in the distance, at other times situating everything front and center. It makes listening to <i>Blaze Colour Burn</i> a distinctly physical experience. In quieter moments you might strain to hear what's going on; similarly, when the extraneous crowd bustle is foregrounded, it feels like your brain needs to do some filtering to get to what's important. As such, it also poses questions about what the important elements are when listening to music, especially when non-musical forms take on a strange rhythm of their own. There are no echelons of significance here-- an audience member coughing adds just as much as the ripples of vibraphone that light up ""Spiazzacorale"", mainly because of the sense of place they bring.</p>
<p>It's surprising how much movement there is in these ruptured, abstract pieces, with St. Werner casting each track as a tiny journey to undertake. Part of its <a href=""http://thrilljockey.com/thrill/Jan-St-Werner/Blaze-Colour-Burn"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stated intent</a> is for the listener to question their position in relation to the music, to figure out where they are situated in the listening process. It works along those lines to a certain extent, but there's also a flipside to it that has more in common with St. Werner's work in Mouse on Mars, where you get slung adrift, wandering around in gigantic structures like the 13-minute ""Cloud Diachroma"". <i>Blaze Colour Burn</i> lands somewhere in between music that makes you hyper-aware of your place in relation to it and something that removes you from thinking about yourself altogether. That split creates a subtle tension at the heart of the record, positioning it as a maze-like structure where getting lost and found become equally gratifying.</p></div>"|18112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18112-jan-st-werner-blaze-colour-burn/|6.7|Nick Neyland

It's hard to tell, sometimes, if those noises represent the crackle of cell phone interference or the creaky floor of an old house: The opening piece, ""Neighborhood"", churns together little bits of composer and performer Aaron Roche's processed voice with furious scribbles of tremolo'd string, a waveform that Wohl snags with his software and distends, so that we no longer picture human arms generating the sound. There are an abundance of other noises here, too, all of them of hazy origin-- some percussive clicks, some radiant, soft-edged keyboard arpeggios, a shimmer effect that resembles locusts or a lawn sprinkler. There is some groaning, burping electronic noise in the music's low end that could be a groaning double bass or electronics. This zone of confusion, between the digital glitch and bow-on-string screech, is where Wohl lives, and <i>Corps Exquis </i>gets more interesting the more confused you get.</p>
<p>The album, recorded by the modern classical guitarist and composer Andrew McKenna Lee, is beautiful and maze-like, with sounds emanating from all directions in your listening space. It is performed by the excellent five-piece ensemble Transit (percussion, clarinet and bass clarinet, violin, cello, and piano), which Wohl co-founded. The album is a kind of all-star affair, at least as far as the tight-knit world of NYC contemporary classical is concerned: So Percussion show up on ""Neighborhood""; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"" target=""_blank"">Julia Holter</a> drops by on ""Corpus"". They render Wohl's music as a world overrun with small scrapes and fidgets, constantly scurrying across the floorboards while larger, more patient sounds operate above. ""Insext"" opens on a digital storm of white noise, overlaid with wisps of bowed string harmonics. A little string melody eventually rises out of the din, like someone whispering some half-remembered Copland, but it's promptly buffeted by waves of digital percussion. This push and pull, this sense that the music Transit plays is being sucked into the void and spit out transformed, like the tennis-ball scene in <i>Poltergeist</i>, is part of what makes Wohl such an original voice.</p>
<p>His voice is not manic, however, and his canvas is not seething: Even as it's surrounded by a clattering of pots and pans, the center of ""323"" is a radiant, booming nimbus of major chords, moving slowly. ""Cantus"" meanwhile, opens on a gently piling snowdrift of strings, all bowing in different pattern to create a gorgeously featureless expanse similar to Arvo Pärt's <i>Fratres For Eight Cellos</i>. Slowly, other noises creep into the frame-- a sharp, stabbing cello sound, some hollow rattles, like bottles being racked up at a bar counter. The piece dissolves, near the end, into a distressed racket of competing cries from all players, but Wohl leaves us with a contemplatively cool sound in its last seconds, a small sigh. In each piece, clamor briefly overwhelms serenity, but each time, clamor loses.  </p>
<p>Most pieces operate on both planes at once: ""Ouverture"" generates a hushed, expectant mood that recalls George Crumb's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoE0ffvhlDE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Star-Child""</a>. That piece builds its most fearsome roar from an old-fashioned pedaled piano, then fans out into a soothing hum of manipulated string textures. Whatever Wohl's vision is, about the noise of digital lives, and how they affect the mind, it isn't binary: Solace, these pieces seem to argue, can come from anywhere we look for it. </p></div>"|18244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18244-daniel-wohl-corps-exquis/|7.9|Jayson Greene

He's a space cadet in the interview, turning idly in a messy room. By my count he names eight items, three of which are stuffed animals, with a fourth being a shelf of children's action figures overlooking his computer. It's a performance by an artist who at the time was still trying to shake his reputation as a barely legal trance wunderkind/Britney Spears remixer: Holden had burst onto the scene in the late 90s with the kind of progressive tracks that fans <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf8d7Pz2Ssg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">still upload</a> to YouTube accompanied by pictures of beaches and sunsets.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">He probably wouldn't admit it, but Holden learned something from those early trance hits: go big or go home. It's an impulse he's honed even as he's backpedaled from his early recordings: see his skyscraping <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jmZTtFxcUg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1658-nathan-fake/"" target=""_blank"">Nathan Fake</a>'s ""The Sky Was Pink"". Holden's second album, <i>The Inheritors</i>, is a raging bonfire of electro-acoustic composition. His kindling is the open-field psychedelia of groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"" target=""_blank"">Cluster</a> and Popol Vuh, with a healthy amount of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a>'s dusty gaze. Broken into 15 tracks but playing like a long, evolving piece, <i>The Inheritors</i> oscillates between buzzy pastoral beauty and harsh rhythmic duress. It's the sound of an artist uniquely in tune with his instrument, as Holden coaxes all manner of beastly noise out of his mighty modular synthesizer, trying to keep that sound organized and only sometimes succeeding.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Holden takes advantage of that instrument-- essentially a bespoke synthesis engine adapted for each track, aided by software Holden writes himself-- by embracing its imprecision. He recorded his curdling circuitry live, capturing plenty of pots and divots in the process, which gives <i>The Inheritors</i> a savage and craggy feel. If Boards of Canada evoke the beauty and majesty of the rolling countryside, Holden is puts you in direct contact with it, forcing you to engage its uneven terrain and irregular placements. This comes through on tracks like ""The Illuminations"", on which pretty, circular patterns are interrupted by haphazard distortion and chords are held to the speaker's breaking point.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In most electronic music, the core elements-- drums, bassline, lead-- play well-defined roles and inhabit familiar sonic spaces. <i>The Inheritors</i> doesn't work like that. The rhythms and melodies come from odd places, sometimes switching roles during the course of a song. The title track, for example, is a hurricane of sound, sharp percussive hits fighting back a massive, distorted midrange assault. When Holden does break out traditional drum sounds-- during the climax of lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15428-renata/"" target=""_blank"">""Renata""</a> or ""Delabole"", for example-- they amplify the intensity, offering the gargled synth patterns something to spring from. <i>The Inheritors</i> comes to a head with ""Gone Feral"" and the title track, a sequence during which Holden unleashes his circuity and records the carnage. The hissing, buckling oscillations during this stretch wipe clean the careful pacing of tracks like ""Inter-City 125"" and ""Rannoch Dawn"". When he dials it down afterwards he has a sense of humor about it: ""Some Respite"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's difficult to describe the sound of <i>The Inheritors</i> without coming off like an analog apologist. But turn a track like ""Blackpool Late Eightes""-- the penultimate and longest track, which acts as something of a victory lap-- up on a good system and you can feel its humming warmth, the air it browbeats around the room. You can imagine a shamanic Holden working amidst his machines, alternately reigning them in and provoking them. After dozens of listens, <i>The Inheritors</i> still feels like it could fall off the rails at any moment, that its wires could trip and the whole album devolve into a mess of feedback that will have you racing to unplug your speakers. Holden's ability to wrangle a complex synthesizer isn't unique; his ability to make that skill seem utterly necessary, is. </p></div>"|18184.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18184-james-holden-the-inheritors/|8.2|Andrew Gaerig

It’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4456-townes-van-zandt/"" target=""_blank"">Townes Van Zandt</a>’s most popular tune by a good mile, an enigmatic tale of two outlaws on the run from the <i>federales</i>-- like <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> if Robert Redford had shot Paul Newman in the back. The most popular version is by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3107-willie-nelson/"">Willie Nelson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1872-merle-haggard/"">Merle Haggard</a>, which hit Number One on the country charts in 1983. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2045-emmylou-harris/"">Emmylou Harris</a> covered it, as did <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1283-steve-earle/"">Steve Earle</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5581-michael-hurley/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Michael Hurley</a>, and countless amateurs on YouTube. Just this past Record Store Day, Elizabeth Cook released a tender version on a b-side with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5343-jason-isbell/"">Jason Isbell</a>. It's taken that many people to even begin to figure out what exactly the song is about and how it works: Does it eulogize Pancho Villa, the notorious Mexican outlaw who reportedly had a friend named Lefty? If so, why does it not match up to the known details of his life? Is it an allegorical tale? A huckster’s hoax? A Mexican-American tall tale reduced to life-size proportions? Whatever it is, the song possesses a stark sadness as the lyrics recount not only the death of Pancho but also the last lonely days of Lefty. “Pancho needs your prayers, it’s true, but save a few for Lefty, too,” goes that last verse. “He just did what he had to do, and now he’s growing old.”</p>
<p>Such powerful understatement was typical of Van Zandt, who preferred to insinuate emotions rather than state them outright. That approach put him (and other songwriters like him) at odds with the sentimentality of mainstream Nashville in the 1970s, when such artists as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5219-dolly-parton/"">Dolly Parton</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2586-loretta-lynn/"">Loretta Lynn</a>, and even the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"">Man in Black Himself</a>, deep into his cornball phase, evoked the past in perfectly pastoral terms, as though rural poverty constituted paradise. Rootless and all but disowned by his oil-wealthy Texas family, Van Zandt was too much of a wanderer to indulge such nostalgia for simpler times. Instead, his songs address the present moment, whether implicitly or explicitly. That’s why so many people have read “Pancho &amp; Lefty” as conceptual rather than actual: It’s so unconcerned with evoking a point in time that it becomes somehow timeless-- not merely relevant across decades, which it certainly has proved to be, but more interested in ideas rather than actual men. That’s what is meant when Van Zandt is described as “cosmic.”</p>
<p>There are two versions of “Pancho &amp; Lefty” among the three new Van Zandt reissues from Omnivore Records, who hopefully have many more in the wings. Not only could the pair not be any more different from one another and still be the same song, but each version speaks to a different aspect of Van Zandt’s appeal. The first, from his 1972 album <i>The Late Great Townes Van Zandt</i>, was produced by Cowboy Jack Clement, who fills the space in the song with strings, mariachi horns, and all manner of studio tricks. The second, an alternate mix on the 2xCD demos and alt-takes set <i>Sunshine Boy</i>, is minimal by comparison, with only a handful of live instruments accompanying Van Zandt. The only elements that connect them are his unpretentiously hangdog vocals and that wandering piano line that never finds a place to rest and so enacts the song’s outlaw existentialism.</p>
<p>Here are two sides of Van Zandt, as clearly distinguished as if by state lines. The full studio version is decorous and even a bit gaudy, as was Cowboy Jack’s peculiar style, but it’s also moody and cinematic, with those horns evoking a wide-open plain that’s either a desert or a void. Historically, it’s been too easy to dismiss this version, as many Townes fans disregard Clement’s studio ministrations as overwrought and overbearing. Even Van Zandt himself disowned the horns and strings, claiming they were added without his say-so. And yet, on “Pancho &amp; Lefty” as throughout <i>The Late Great</i>, Clement’s production tends to be as eccentric as Van Zandt himself. The lackadaisical plod of his cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8980-hank-williams/"">Hank Williams</a>’ “Honky Tonkin’” implies a Music Row absurdism bolstered by the pots-and-pans percussion and fuzzed-out guitar solo. The sci-fi experiment “Silver Ships of Andilar” is self-consciously grandiose, almost like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/"">Serge Gainsbourg</a> drinking Shiner and munching kolaches, and ominous synths interrupt the crushing desperation of “Snow Don’t Fall”, a devastating memorial to his girlfriend, who was murdered while hitchhiking to a recording session. If <i>The Late Great</i> is overwrought, as even Colin Escott claims in the new liners, it’s always overwrought with great purpose and conceptual weight.</p>
<p>The alternate mix of “Pancho &amp; Lefty”, advertised on the tracklist as “without strings and horns,” points to another facet of Van Zandt’s catalog, which jibes more easily and naturally with listeners’ understanding of the Lone Star troubadour. It’s earthier and more direct-- a very real and gritty story rather than a parable-- as the Texan ponders the deep ache of severed friendship, abrupt betrayal, and lifelong regret. Because these demos and alt-takes emphasize austere arrangements that push Van Zandt’s vocals to the forefront, <i>Sunshine Boy</i> may be the ideal point of entry for listeners intimidated by his decades-spanning catalog as well as by his reputation as the ultimate songwriter’s songwriter. It includes many of his best songs, including what may be the best version of “To Live Is to Fly”. The guitar picking is clear and immediate, the vocals more fluid in their phrasings, accentuating the song’s casual melody. Van Zandt considered it among his best compositions, and it’s not hard to see why: In addition to conveying a simple philosophy of existence as a journey to some unknown destination, it evokes the transience of life lived out on the road, culminating in a few verses that are as close to perfect as Van Zandt-- or any other country musician, for that matter-- ever got: “It’s goodbye to all my friends, it’s time to go again,” he sings with affecting stoicism. “But think of all the poetry and the pickin’ down the line.”</p>
<p>Sadly, it’s impossible to miss that the themes Van Zandt explored in his lyrics are themes that played out in his own life, which was defined by rootlessness, loneliness, senseless tragedy, and unending remorse. The songs on these three reissues-- which are so of a piece and of a moment that they may best be thought of as a single, very persuasive box set-- all share a sense of motion, of always passing people by: the life of a touring musician certainly, but also the days of a man unmoored in the American West. Van Zandt had brief careers in college and the Air Force, which were cut short by bouts of depression, alcoholism, and insulin shock therapy. Despite his reputation among his peers as an ace picker and songwriter, his recording career was a non-starter, interrupted by a 10-year absence during which he laid low and played roadhouses around Texas but rarely, if ever, entered a studio. The characters in these songs-- especially those who serve as stand-ins for Van Zandt himself-- are always on the verge of leaving wherever they are, although he manages to cut that melancholy with the optimism that their paths will cross again. “Well, goodbye friends, it’s time to close, everybody knows that’s the way it goes,” he sings on “You Are Not Needed Now”, which loses none of its evocative power for never being too specific about its subject. “Where was it you lived in case I’m ever there?”</p>
<p>That song appears twice on <i>Sunshine Boy</i> and once on <i>High, Low &amp; In Between</i>, but the alternate take, which features a piano intro and a band that knows the absolute best time to come in, may actually be the definitive version of the song, with a hymnal directness and a stoicism in the face of endless farewells. If <i>The Late, Great</i> sharpens the cosmic cowboy orchestrations and <i>Sunshine Boy</i> winnows the songs to their barest essentials, then <i>High, Low and in Between</i> more than lives up to its title. Unsurprisingly, Van Zandt inhabits the in-between so comfortably that this becomes one of the best country-rock records ever made, full of humor (“No Deal”), heartache (“Greensboro Woman”), and commiseration  (“Highway Kind”). Softening that melancholy somewhat is a trio of country-gospel numbers that strike a celebratory note: “Two Hands” opens the album by explaining that his physical body makes possible spiritual salvation through music, while “Standin’” (a rearrangement of a traditional tune) suggests that his troubles extend well beyond his birth and death. In other words, his life is just an excerpt of a continuum of despair; the song itself is, cosmically, upbeat.</p></div>"|18190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18190-townes-van-zandt-high-low-and-in-between-the-late-great-townes-van-zandt-sunshine-boy-the-unheard-studio-sessions-and-demos-1971-1972/|8.8|Stephen M.

It's taken that many people to even begin to figure out what exactly the song is about and how it works: Does it eulogize Pancho Villa, the notorious Mexican outlaw who reportedly had a friend named Lefty? If so, why does it not match up to the known details of his life? Is it an allegorical tale? A huckster’s hoax? A Mexican-American tall tale reduced to life-size proportions? Whatever it is, the song possesses a stark sadness as the lyrics recount not only the death of Pancho but also the last lonely days of Lefty. “Pancho needs your prayers, it’s true, but save a few for Lefty, too,” goes that last verse. “He just did what he had to do, and now he’s growing old.”</p>
<p>Such powerful understatement was typical of Van Zandt, who preferred to insinuate emotions rather than state them outright. That approach put him (and other songwriters like him) at odds with the sentimentality of mainstream Nashville in the 1970s, when such artists as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5219-dolly-parton/"">Dolly Parton</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2586-loretta-lynn/"">Loretta Lynn</a>, and even the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"">Man in Black Himself</a>, deep into his cornball phase, evoked the past in perfectly pastoral terms, as though rural poverty constituted paradise. Rootless and all but disowned by his oil-wealthy Texas family, Van Zandt was too much of a wanderer to indulge such nostalgia for simpler times. Instead, his songs address the present moment, whether implicitly or explicitly. That’s why so many people have read “Pancho &amp; Lefty” as conceptual rather than actual: It’s so unconcerned with evoking a point in time that it becomes somehow timeless-- not merely relevant across decades, which it certainly has proved to be, but more interested in ideas rather than actual men. That’s what is meant when Van Zandt is described as “cosmic.”</p>
<p>There are two versions of “Pancho &amp; Lefty” among the three new Van Zandt reissues from Omnivore Records, who hopefully have many more in the wings. Not only could the pair not be any more different from one another and still be the same song, but each version speaks to a different aspect of Van Zandt’s appeal. The first, from his 1972 album <i>The Late Great Townes Van Zandt</i>, was produced by Cowboy Jack Clement, who fills the space in the song with strings, mariachi horns, and all manner of studio tricks. The second, an alternate mix on the 2xCD demos and alt-takes set <i>Sunshine Boy</i>, is minimal by comparison, with only a handful of live instruments accompanying Van Zandt. The only elements that connect them are his unpretentiously hangdog vocals and that wandering piano line that never finds a place to rest and so enacts the song’s outlaw existentialism.</p>
<p>Here are two sides of Van Zandt, as clearly distinguished as if by state lines. The full studio version is decorous and even a bit gaudy, as was Cowboy Jack’s peculiar style, but it’s also moody and cinematic, with those horns evoking a wide-open plain that’s either a desert or a void. Historically, it’s been too easy to dismiss this version, as many Townes fans disregard Clement’s studio ministrations as overwrought and overbearing. Even Van Zandt himself disowned the horns and strings, claiming they were added without his say-so. And yet, on “Pancho &amp; Lefty” as throughout <i>The Late Great</i>, Clement’s production tends to be as eccentric as Van Zandt himself. The lackadaisical plod of his cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8980-hank-williams/"">Hank Williams</a>’ “Honky Tonkin’” implies a Music Row absurdism bolstered by the pots-and-pans percussion and fuzzed-out guitar solo. The sci-fi experiment “Silver Ships of Andilar” is self-consciously grandiose, almost like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/"">Serge Gainsbourg</a> drinking Shiner and munching kolaches, and ominous synths interrupt the crushing desperation of “Snow Don’t Fall”, a devastating memorial to his girlfriend, who was murdered while hitchhiking to a recording session. If <i>The Late Great</i> is overwrought, as even Colin Escott claims in the new liners, it’s always overwrought with great purpose and conceptual weight.</p>
<p>The alternate mix of “Pancho &amp; Lefty”, advertised on the tracklist as “without strings and horns,” points to another facet of Van Zandt’s catalog, which jibes more easily and naturally with listeners’ understanding of the Lone Star troubadour. It’s earthier and more direct-- a very real and gritty story rather than a parable-- as the Texan ponders the deep ache of severed friendship, abrupt betrayal, and lifelong regret. Because these demos and alt-takes emphasize austere arrangements that push Van Zandt’s vocals to the forefront, <i>Sunshine Boy</i> may be the ideal point of entry for listeners intimidated by his decades-spanning catalog as well as by his reputation as the ultimate songwriter’s songwriter. It includes many of his best songs, including what may be the best version of “To Live Is to Fly”. The guitar picking is clear and immediate, the vocals more fluid in their phrasings, accentuating the song’s casual melody. Van Zandt considered it among his best compositions, and it’s not hard to see why: In addition to conveying a simple philosophy of existence as a journey to some unknown destination, it evokes the transience of life lived out on the road, culminating in a few verses that are as close to perfect as Van Zandt-- or any other country musician, for that matter-- ever got: “It’s goodbye to all my friends, it’s time to go again,” he sings with affecting stoicism. “But think of all the poetry and the pickin’ down the line.”</p>
<p>Sadly, it’s impossible to miss that the themes Van Zandt explored in his lyrics are themes that played out in his own life, which was defined by rootlessness, loneliness, senseless tragedy, and unending remorse. The songs on these three reissues-- which are so of a piece and of a moment that they may best be thought of as a single, very persuasive box set-- all share a sense of motion, of always passing people by: the life of a touring musician certainly, but also the days of a man unmoored in the American West. Van Zandt had brief careers in college and the Air Force, which were cut short by bouts of depression, alcoholism, and insulin shock therapy. Despite his reputation among his peers as an ace picker and songwriter, his recording career was a non-starter, interrupted by a 10-year absence during which he laid low and played roadhouses around Texas but rarely, if ever, entered a studio. The characters in these songs-- especially those who serve as stand-ins for Van Zandt himself-- are always on the verge of leaving wherever they are, although he manages to cut that melancholy with the optimism that their paths will cross again. “Well, goodbye friends, it’s time to close, everybody knows that’s the way it goes,” he sings on “You Are Not Needed Now”, which loses none of its evocative power for never being too specific about its subject. “Where was it you lived in case I’m ever there?”</p>
<p>That song appears twice on <i>Sunshine Boy</i> and once on <i>High, Low &amp; In Between</i>, but the alternate take, which features a piano intro and a band that knows the absolute best time to come in, may actually be the definitive version of the song, with a hymnal directness and a stoicism in the face of endless farewells. If <i>The Late, Great</i> sharpens the cosmic cowboy orchestrations and <i>Sunshine Boy</i> winnows the songs to their barest essentials, then <i>High, Low and in Between</i> more than lives up to its title. Unsurprisingly, Van Zandt inhabits the in-between so comfortably that this becomes one of the best country-rock records ever made, full of humor (“No Deal”), heartache (“Greensboro Woman”), and commiseration  (“Highway Kind”). Softening that melancholy somewhat is a trio of country-gospel numbers that strike a celebratory note: “Two Hands” opens the album by explaining that his physical body makes possible spiritual salvation through music, while “Standin’” (a rearrangement of a traditional tune) suggests that his troubles extend well beyond his birth and death. In other words, his life is just an excerpt of a continuum of despair; the song itself is, cosmically, upbeat.</p></div>"|18190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18190-townes-van-zandt-high-low-and-in-between-the-late-great-townes-van-zandt-sunshine-boy-the-unheard-studio-sessions-and-demos-1971-1972/|8.5|Stephen M.

Migos are both natural descendents of Atlanta's florid coke rap cottage industry and purveyors of something defiantly stranger. On the surface, <i>Young Rich Niggas</i> appears to traffic in slight, hooky pop rap, but the abundance of aesthetic and lyrical quirks here also genuflect to rap’s frayed outskirts.</p>
<p><i>Young Rich Niggas</i>’ lyric sheet is a vast expanse of trap house platitudes, but Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff’s absurdist humor sets these songs apart from the pack. “China Town” juggles plentiful references to Asian culture-- Honda, Mortal Kombat, Manny Pacquiao-- hilariously failing to hit on anything legitimitely Chinese. Mixtape highlight “Hannah Montana” is a flurry of bald-faced boasts about proficiency at dealing drugs, but the codenames for the product are all culled from white female TV, movie, and pop stars. It’s the song’s chorus that illuminates Migos’ incontrovertible weirdness, though. At the end of each verse Quavo bludgeons the mix shouting “Hannah Montana! Hannah Montana! Hannah Montana! Hannah Montana!” until he’s driven home the principal silliness of the word combo. Migos' choruses work like that a lot of the time: the badgering, hypnotic repetition of “Trapped out the bando” on “Bando” and the comically insistent “Versace/ Versace Versace/ Versace Versace” refrain of “Versace” warp each phrase in your mind until they hit the ear like something other than English, hammering hooks home with the manic urgency of toy commercials.</p>
<p>If that seems like a shaky foundation for an hour-long mixtape, know that Migos’ bag of rhyme schemes is more varied and adventurous than simple catchphrase repetition: <i>Young Rich Niggas</i> houses capable double-time speed trials like “Cook It Up”, brawlers like “Hannah Montana” and “China Town”, the half-baked self-satisfied stunting of “Bando”, dalliances with sung hooks on “Adios” and Auto-Tune experimentation on “Finesser” and “Pronto”. And for all its smart alecky veneer, <i>Y.R.N.</i> is shot through with a palpable darkness that comes to a head at the end of the tape: there's the one-two punch of “R.I.P.”, an ode to Future’s recently deceased Freeband Gang associate OG Double D, and “Thank You God (Outro)”, a rags-to-riches yarn that charts Migos’ progression from childhood adversity (“Daddy was a hospital patient/ Next thing you know he ain’t make it”) to financial comfort that’s couched in the self-flagellating remorse of Offset’s proclamation that he “sinned every day just to get this success.”</p>
<p>Migos’ deceptively simple lyricism favors production that follows suit. Trap’s booming 808s and ticking hi-hats are still present, but where the production of, say, a Rick Ross song is designed to blurt out of speakers like a battering ram pushed it through, <i>Y.R.N.</i> shoots for pared down productions that highlight the strengths of the songwriting. The staccato synth blips on Zaytoven’s “Versace” beat race against the lyrics laid over them. The plodding piano line on “Adios” walks in lock step with its sung hook. Dun Deal fades the foreboding bells and guitars of “Hannah Montana” after each verse, punching up Quavo’s frantic chorus for maximum effect. Guest MCs similarly fold into the songs where they’re featured. Gucci Mane goes along with the gummy Auto-Tune shtick of “Dennis Rodman”, and Trinidad James and Riff Raff’s contributions to “Out Da Gym” are surprisingly reserved. (<a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> jumped on a remix of “Versace” last week and coopted the Migos cadence with childlike zeal.)  The willingness of Migos’ collaborators to follow their lead feels like a vote of confidence in their sound, a rarity in a time of rap game Frankenstein’s monsters like A$AP Rocky’s “Fuckin’ Problems” and Kanye West’s remix of Chief Keef’s “Don’t Like”, releases that played like pic-stitches of the artists’ famous friends.</p>
<p><i>Young Rich Niggas</i> finds Migos perfecting their sound even as they bristle at it, and the tape rarely delivers anything resembling a failure. The subject matter can be suffocating in its cavalier depravity, especially on tracks like “FEMA”, which employs a heavy-handed metaphor comparing one’s speed at whipping up crack to the movements of Hurricane Katrina, and Migos’ kingpin fantasies also hit a few sour notes racially speaking. (See: <i>Y.R.N.</i>’s bottomless stream of Latin names for cocaine connects and “China Town”, whose adventures in drug smuggling are periodically punctuated by gross “ching chong” ad libs.) <i>Y.R.N.</i>’s indiscretions are usually, mercifully scant, however, and the group never approaches this material with anything less than an affable, good-natured goofiness. With <i>Young Rich Niggas</i>, Migos have peeled the gruff exterior off of trap and revealed the giddy, catchy party music underfoot.</p></div>"|18264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18264-migos-yrn-young-rich-niggas/|7.4|Craig Jenkins

When they released <i>Sense Net </i>last year, Nash’s presence still loomed large, even amidst the influence of vintage avant-electronic acts and industrial bands. Since then, however, the pair have struck out on a far more idiosyncratic course. <i>Contact</i>, their first full-length, abandons <i>Sense Net</i>’s gently psychedelic R&amp;B bump, along with anything resembling traditional pop song structure. Maybe those things are still there somewhere, just radically mutated, rapidly evolved into unrecognizable new shapes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Contact</i><span> opens with a short sound effects vignette where someone enters a high tech enclosure and connects to a data network using a computer that offers roughly digital voice prompts. Having successfully logged in, we encounter reverb-rich pads, synthesized nonsense vocal sounds, and finger snaps that lead in a beat that skitters and booms and refuses to settle into one steady pattern. Instead, it flickers between drum &amp; bass, Chicago footwork, two-step, and, during a couple of moments, the kind of R&amp;B the pair were doing back on </span><i>Sense Net</i><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The rest of the songs operate in a similar fashion, with the pair establishing a sonic premise, then giving it a gentle push and following where it rolls. “Narco” begins with metallic-toned synth arpeggios, a minimal but vaguely menacing kick drum part, and a sprinkling of aquatic-sounding digital blips. Over the next eight minutes, it touches on everything from turn of the millennium radio rap to VHS-era action movie soundtracks, and includes a frantic digital slap bass solo and tones that sound like they could have been sampled from a vintage PC operating system.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Many of the songs float off into full-on ambience at some point in their journey. “Arcadia” actually begins there, with long, leisurely stretches of blissed-out synth pads decorated with little scraps of sound-- a heavily manipulated vocal sample or a brief keyboard figure-- that float leisurely by. Every once in a while a little bit of structure creeps in and the song drifts almost to the point of something that could pass for R&amp;B, but only briefly, and then it drifts gently back.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s an intensely dreamy record, and a very futuristic one too. It’s a slightly dated brand of futurism though, full of sounds lifted from primitive early samplers, organic percussion sounds that suggest a particularly 90s “tribal” aesthetic, and low-resolution computer voices that say things like “data connection” and “systems online.” It’s the sound of 2013, but more specifically of 2013 as it looked in the early days of </span><i>Wired</i><span> magazine, when digital culture was first starting to emerge. </span><i>Contact</i><span> seems like the type of thing the fringier characters from a William Gibson cyberpunk novel would put on when they want to kick back and smoke a spliff.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s kind of a bummer to see two producers who were so good at making a particular kind of music essentially leave it behind with barely any finished recordings to show for it (although they still dabble in R&amp;B with the Chicago vocal trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31126-jody/"" target=""_blank"">JODY</a>), but that’s really the only disappointing thing about <i>Contact</i>. It may not offer pre-existing the-Drum fans what they may have thought they wanted from the group’s first album, but what it delivers is powerful stuff. The pair only recently started performing outside of Chicago, and last week I saw them play one of their first shows in New York City. No one was dancing, which is usually a huge problem for a concert of what’s ostensibly dance music, but the two didn’t seem concerned in the least bit as they built up, warped, and tore down one richly textured sonic structure after another. And they shouldn’t have been. No one was dancing, but everyone was mesmerized.</p></div>"|18210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18210-the-drum-contact/|7.5|Miles Raymer

She appeared last spring in a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFR8yVn8GSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">handful</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXP1oFmRboI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">of</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFR8yVn8GSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">videos</a> that embodied drill’s most enticing qualities: youthful DIY energy, a cohesive aesthetic, and simple, brutally menacing hooks. Her one-off tracks and her first mixtape, <a href=""http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/18708/katie_got_bandz_bandz_and_hittaz.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Bandz and Hittaz</i></a>, were spun around infectiously loud chants delivered in a raspy bark, underscoring Waka Flocka Flame’s role as the godfather of drill. She’s also become something of a rap-lover’s folk-hero, largely because she’s a master of slang and catch phrases-- <i>""Katieeeee!""</i>-- and because her online persona is brashly funny. “ROMENY SAID MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY IS IRRELEVANT FUCK HIM,” she wrote on Twitter during the Presidential Election as part of her ongoing personal campaign against Mitt Romney. ""THE BEST PART ABOUT NOT GIVING A FUCK IS REALLY NOT GIVING A FUCK,"" she once wrote. Her jubilant confidence has often been thrilling.</p>
<p>But when Katie took the stage at this year's South by Southwest for her show at the Fader Fort-- which you could stream live online-- she froze up, timidly shouting over a backing track like someone who'd lost a bet at a crowded karaoke bar. Gone was the ebullient swagger and take-no-prisoners attitude that got her noticed over the last year. Her long-promised new mixtape, the delightfully titled <a href=""http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/21187/katie-got-bandz-drillary-clinton.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Drillary Clinton</i></a>, transmits that trepidation and inexperience. What could’ve been an event tape is instead a minor release that will likely lurk in the shadows of Katie’s outsized persona.</p>
<p>Higher stakes seem to have an adverse affect on Katie’s brute-force approach to rapping. Excepting “Y U Mad”-- a sneaky hit in its own right-- and the King Louie collaboration “Pop Out”, there’s a hesitant, unnatural air to <i>Drillary Clinton</i> that finds Katie dragging through some of her verses, sounding timid or lethargic rather than purposefully measured or unhurried. “Fuck fighting/ We shooting/ Catch up!/Y’all losing/ Keep it on us/ No snoozing!”, she shouts on the cumbersome “Finessin’” (like many of <i>Drillary Clinton</i>’s tracks, this one was produced by drill mainstay BlockOnDaTrakk). Occasionally the apprehension or clumsiness is endearing: the Auto-Tuned “Foreign” has an ugly-beautiful sound not unlike Chief Keef’s “Citgo”; her imitations of other rappers’ adlibs-- “skirrrr!”, “nawwhh”, “bow-bow”-- expose her as someone who just plain loves rap music.</p>
<p>Still, she recedes from the foreground too often-- something that doesn’t work, given her style's emphasis of presence over lyrical dexterity. This becomes especially clear when she's heard alongside guests like Dreezy, who offers an explosive verse on “Knock a Hoe”. Dreezy's another young woman from the Chicago's drill scene-- paradoxically, the hyper-aggressive sound has tended to neutralize gender, breeding a disproportionately large crop of new female rappers. Inside it all, Katie sits quietly, reminding us that she still has plenty of room to grow into the authoritative spirit she baited us with at the onset.</p></div>"|17934.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17934-katie-got-bandz-drillary-clinton/|5.5|Carrie Battan

The connection makes a kind of retroactive sense going back to their early 2000s solo debuts, <i>Fantastic Damage</i> and <i>Monster</i>. Both albums seethed with the anxious funk of retrofuture 808s-and-synths production that rattled trunks and cages with unrestrained intensity. And both portrayed the artists as out-of-control forces trying their damnedest to stay true to friends, family, and hip-hop while confronting disenfranchisement, abuse, and cynicism. That their creators would gravitate towards collaboration makes even more sense now than it does with hindsight in mind, as the 1-2 hooks to the head of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16641-cancer-for-cure/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cancer for Cure</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16537-killer-mike-rap-music/"" target=""_blank""><i>R.A.P. Music</i></a> shared not just a producer and a timeframe, but the kind of catharsis-fueled defiance that career no-sellout vets live and breathe.</p>
<p>Thankfully, El-P and Killer Mike made a point to keep working together, and by all accounts their two-MCs/one-producer teamup <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51324-download-killer-mike-and-el-ps-run-the-jewels-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>Run the Jewels</i></a> was meant to be some kind of “cool-down” record-- just something they could brainstorm up and record as a sort of fun, no-stress victory lap in celebration of a triumphant 2012. But if that kind of session reads as a low-stakes slack-off, especially in the form of a free 33-minute download, keep in mind just what constitutes “fun” for these guys. At the top of the list, it's the process-- workshopping ideas, putting things together, delivering them with conviction, and bringing it out to a rampant fanbase prone to drawing <a href=""http://el-p.tumblr.com/post/53858236636/more-run-the-jewels-greatness-from-sawbrey"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">irreverent fan-art</a> and <a href=""http://store.foolsgoldrecs.com/products/run-the-jewels-grinder"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ordering special-edition herb grinders</a>. No excuse to relax here.</p>
<p>The only significant sign that El-P and Killer Mike are taking things “easier” on this album is the focus on shit-talk: aside from the confessional coming-of-age self-pep talk of closer “A Christmas Fucking Miracle”, there's little-to-no high-concept storytelling and a minimum of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13626-reagan/"" target=""_blank"">“Reagan”</a>/”Drones Over Bklyn”-style political science. They haven't gotten complacent-- that latter song gets fleetingly referenced in a Mike line on “DDFH”, one of the few verses that catches the same police-state anger that <i>R.A.P. Music </i>did. And El still raps like somebody who's not sure if he's the last sane man or the craziest man on earth, carrying his refined maniacal diatribes over from <i>Cancer for Cure</i>. But the majority of <i>Run the Jewels </i>is a succession of throw-shit-out-a-window anthems which take the early-LL knuckles-first bragging that inspired the name, running their own psilocybin-tinged mean streak through it.</p>
<p>The deepest messages of <i>Run the Jewels </i>are the ones dedicated to figuring out just how many ways there are to threaten bodily trauma in the most over-the-top language possible while not actually coming across like some screwfaced shock-value manchild. It feels as though the options of either catching a bad one or riding with them are easier to decide between because the latter sounds like it'd be a hell of a time anyways. And there's this sense of friendly, unspoken one-upsmanship between the two MCs that keeps upping the stakes. Mike on the title track: “I'll pull this pistol, put it on your poodle or your fuckin' baby.” El on “Sea Legs”: “Try to pet my fuckin' head again and I'm'a put a tooth through the flesh of the palm that you jack with.” Mike on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15377-run-the-jewels-get-it/"" target=""_blank"">“Get It”</a>: “stupid goofy stoolie, the gooch in Gucci will slap you/ and that go for the cop-kissing cats that's in the back of you.” El on “Twin Hype Back”: “Me and Mike'll go Twin Hype and do a dance on your windpipe/ put your fuckin' jazz hands back in your pants or get them shits sliced.” It's a game of the dozens where the barbs are aimed outwards and funny-looking moms are swapped for an all-encompassing People Who Fuck With Us category.</p>
<p>In the process, both MCs have both started to meet each other halfway personality-wise, though that wasn't a long trip to begin with. El's panic-attack rasp has grown into this fluid delivery that's become as immersive as his older hitched-timing flow was, spitting slick bars and doubletimes that make the acidic comedy roll out like his own take on vintage Ludacris. And Mike maintains his wrecking-ball mode, but twists it into moments of psychedelic delirium and over-the-top throat tearing, a man incapable of sounding nonchalant about anything getting the chance to turn that elbow-throwing flow into the narrator for a story about getting a lapdance on mushrooms (“No Come Down”) or turning it up to the breaking point on the grimy Tyson-isms of “Job Well Done”. When they get into verse-swapping back-and-forths on “Twin Hype Back”, “Get It”, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50971-listen-el-p-killer-mike-and-big-boi-banana-clipper/"" target=""_blank"">“Banana Clipper”</a> (where an otherwise excellent Big Boi verse bizarrely feels like an afterthought in comparison), or throw around conversational line-finishing asides elsewhere, the rapport's enough to raise questions as to why this teamup was supposed to be unusual in the first place.</p>
<p>This is hardhead music, but it's also supposed to be a good time-- shit, they even brought in Prince Paul to do his oily weirdo pick-up artist Chest Rockwell routine on “Twin Hype Back”. (“I got your glass of Beefeater, I got a brand new deck of Uno cards... how 'bout I come over tonight and pick you up in my brand new Segway?”) So El-P pulls out the stops in making the abrasive, heavy aspects of his production sound boombox-ready. If this stuff's “dystopian,” you might as well book a party bus to Airstrip One: growling synthesized basslines do the heavy lifting as percussion skitters beneath like warped distortions of the 84, 96, and 02 versions of analog hip-hop, a cohesive sound that serves as a reminder that Georgia and New York are both technically East Coast. El's signature production touches-- minor-key chord drones, ligament-snapping guitar squalls, highwire arpeggios, twitchy drum patterns that are as restless as a rock-solid beat can get-- are put to pretty straightforward use this time around.</p>
<p>The beats fit the blueprint of <i>R.A.P. Music</i>'s tendency to let the voices supply most of the brute force; it still bumps like a bastard, but not in the kind of way that had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus </i></a>casualties scrambling for punk rock namedrops. It's just a distilled take on everything that made last year's albums such an event, with all the chrome ripped off and upholstery pulled out so it'll run faster, louder, nastier. Yeah, it's a fun album, and it's probably the most affable thing they've done so far together. But don't take that for a weakness. They don't yank chains-- they snatch them.</p></div>"|18219.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18219-run-the-jewels-run-the-jewels/|8.5|Nate Patrin

Like Blake (and his associates in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28459-mount-kimbie/"">Mount Kimbie</a>), McAndrews makes low-key electronic music that never lets you forget the human presence behind it. In Blake's case, it's his ghostly pillow talk; in McAndrews', it's delicately plucked guitars, grainy field recordings, and a naturalistic sense of drift more akin to ambient music than techno. Portions of his debut, <i>For Years</i>, sound like crosstalk coming in from an open window; others appear to be happening under a pile of leaves.</p>
<p>The album is rooted in the hip-hop mosaics of producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">J Dilla</a> and a subdued take on post-rock. At first it might be hard to figure out what the two styles have to do with each other, and if nothing else <i>For Years</i> connects them as dots in a constellation of instrumental music that favors abstract forms while clinging to an almost classical sense of beauty and grandeur. (The same qualities make duly clear its popularity among stoners.)</p>
<p>Aside from the mid-album exclamation point <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13976-pyramid-lake/"">""Pyramid Lake""</a>, <i>For Years</i> doesn't beg for attention. It is downtempo music, subtle but paradoxically best heard at a distance. Its highlights are tracks that become memorable after multiple listens but are just as easily tuned out: the Karen O-sampling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13317-wait/"">""Wait""</a>, ""Autumn"", and Blake collaboration ""Knives"", whose contorted gospel keyboard progressions are mixed under so much atmosphere they're practically subliminal.</p>
<p>In a recent Pitchfork <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9142-airhead/"">interview</a>, McAdams said that he spent a lot of time growing up listening to music while sitting in front of a computer, ""which I'm sure [the music] wasn't intended for"". Consciously or not, it's a relationship to sound that has seeped completely into <i>For Years</i>, which has an even-keel, almost analgesic quality when played in the background of otherwise uneventful moments.</p>
<p>It takes skill to make music this way-- to exist without disturbing, to engage without interrupting, and to please without sounding like you're going out of your way to do it. But there are tracks on <i>For Years</i> that feel like 30-second ideas stretched to four minutes, or where the music becomes so airy and loose I wonder if even McAdams is convinced it absolutely needs to exist. Ironically, what drew me to <i>For Years</i> on first listen is what held me back on the tenth: Despite its clever syntheses, there are times when it's not much more than pretty.</p>
<p>But the good is not only good, it's promising. Some of <i>For Years</i> was recorded as early as 2009, and McAndrews expressed no interest in changing how he makes music in order to keep so-called pace with his peers. That's noble. His earliest singles-- ""Paper Street"" and the Blake collaborations ""Pembroke"" and ""Lock in the Lion""-- still have an isolated, thrillingly idiosyncratic sound, like blueprints for buildings that nobody ever got around to. Think of <i>For Years</i> as a brick.</p></div>"|18164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18164-airhead-for-years/|7.0|Mike Powell

The Brazilian band have consistently used cool, yelpy electro-punk to take a stand against something or other; shouting out rebuttals to female stereotypes while being coy about it, too. With <i>Planta</i>, they lose their only male member, Adriano Cintra. Unfortunately, that means losing part of CSS' appeal along with him.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Last year, <a href=""http://sendmetojail.blogspot.com/2012/03/how-this-cookie-crumbled.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a ranty, long-winded blogpost</a>, Cintra at least explained why he had to quit, citing artistic priorities, fame-stunting, shady managers, money-swindling, and calling out his bandmates for pretending they were friends when they were anything but. Which really strikes a blow when dealing with a group who are trying to sell we-don’t-give-a-fuck club kid romps. <i>Planta</i> suffers from the same one-trick sameness that plagued <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12016-donkey/"" target=""_blank""><i>Donkey</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15794-la-liberacion/"" target=""_blank""><i>La Liberación</i></a>, two albums that went relatively unnoticed considering their hit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9175-cansei-de-ser-sexy/"" target=""_blank"">debut</a>. Here “Hangover” comes closest to the image that CSS has projected; a song co-written by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3054-rancid/"" target=""_blank"">Rancid</a>’s Tim Armstrong that sweetly declares “I’ve never had a hangover til you,” over a slowly plodding and sunny reggaeton beat. Front-woman Lovefoxxx adopts a drawl that feels hat-tipped to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a> that was dating <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"" target=""_blank"">Diplo</a> when he brought CSS to the U.S. spotlight way back in 2006.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's worth noting that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>’s David Sitek stepped in to executive produce <i>Planta</i>. His flair is something you hear on “Honey”, an open love-letter that burns along to flying, cinematic synth melodies worthy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"" target=""_blank"">Santigold</a> or TVOTR-- morse-code blurts of bass, and vintage roller-rink strobe lights. Instrumentally it’s an electro pop stan’s dream, gloriously cheesy in all the right places. “Sweet” and “Teenage Tiger Cat” fare similarly; expansive cinematics with casually provocative snares that break into relentless bass and bop-along electric guitar. The problem with both tracks, however, remains the total lack of vocal prowess. Sure there are growls on “Teenage Tiger Cat”, but what’s meant to sound like ‘tude or luring temptation mostly comes off as a starlet attempting to seduce a fan who has forgotten she exists.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sentimental ballads show up frequently on <i>Planta</i>, earnestly declaring love and unearthing secret admiration. “Faith In Love” is the least trying because it’s different, a drone of organs and haze-clearing tambourine fades the album out. But its sleepiness is where we’re continuously lost; the singer’s vocals get swallowed by her surroundings, making something that could have been heart-tugging and lovelorn into a song that sounds bored with itself. “Dynamite”-- the best track on the album next to “Hangover”-- shows some signs of life, though, as we’re sucked into a destructive mosh-pit while Foxxx eggs us on (“Burn baby, burn”) to get high on the night and all the things we like. And that's exactly what we want from CSS; for them to shout at us and demand that we seize the day. Unfortunately, on <i>Planta</i>, they only seem half-awake.</p></div>"|18163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18163-css-planta/|5.0|Puja Patel

Earlier this year, the former began distributing releases from the latter, a partnership that produced<i> </i><i>Anthology</i>. It was curated from the 40+ tapes that Boothe's released on his <a href=""http://gloof.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> page in the past four years (including at least seven from 2013), clearly assembled by someone familiar with the best of Knx.’s catalogue. While it eschews the pop remixes that might entice listeners in favor of deeper cuts, its 53 short pieces (most falling between one and two minutes) provide a fine introduction to an enormous, if capricious, talent.</p>
<p>Knx. rejects the free release schedule that so many in the hip-hop community have embraced, which is likely the reason he remains relatively obscure-- his bandcamp mixes, at $5 a pop, are out of your standard internet-comber’s price range. But while post-Dilla beatmaking fervor has reached its highest point, there’s certainly room to be made for a producer steeped in the history of black music and still with it enough to put out remixes of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"" target=""_blank"">Miguel</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>.</p>
<p>The tracks on <i>Anthology</i> don't make it as easy for sample-spotters as on some of Knxledge's past releases. For every Jadakiss ad-lib, every <i>Illmatic </i>skit, there’s an unrecognizable treatment of Camp Lo’s “Luchini AK (This Is It)” or a magical horn salvo like the one on “Pho”. Creating collages from the unfamiliar helps to show the fallacy in thinking of this kind of music as unoriginal, while also adding to Knx.’s legend as a prodigious crate-digger-- a snippet from an episode of ""What’s Happening"" on “Rude” is a perfect find for the track’s dreamy mix. Just as attractive is the beatmaker’s lack of snobbery: one of the best tracks here “[Lets]TalkAbtit” samples liberally from Tori Kelly, an amateur artist best known from <i>America’s Most Talented Kids, </i>and later on, “TooKlose[latensi]” is a remix of Next’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwEZRPkAAu8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">famous warning</a><i>.</i></p>
<p>Comparisons between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a> and Knx. are inevitable as both artists are reclusive and prolific, with more interest in churning out beat after jazzy beat than classifying their music. But there are some key differences. Madlib, as befits Stones Throw's flagship artist, is more polished, his music more holistic, with a better eye for tracks that make sense together. He’s also more exploratory, constantly ranging to different countries and genres, and ocasionally to different personalities, in search of new inspiration. By contrast Knxledge doesn’t seem as interested in albums (he’s more taken with EPs) and his tracks often have little in common from one to the next. He’s firmly ensconced within the world of black American music, and has more interest in sampling and remixing contemporary sounds than Madlib does.</p>
<p>None of which is to say that fans of the former will have anything against the latter. Both are shining examples of an artistic type that seems increasingly rare. (Though, admittedly it can be difficult to get a tally of artistic shut-ins.) A <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/nyregion/discovered-at-64-a-brooklyn-artist-takes-his-place.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent article</a> in the New York Times highlighted another of their kin, a Brooklyn artist named Rafael Leonardo Black, who has been steadily making art for three decades in near total seclusion. Black was quoted as saying that “people who become what are called artists don’t stop.” <i>Anthology </i>demonstrates about as well as any of his other releases that Knx. is a consummate artist.</p></div>"|18237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18237-knx-anthology/|7.6|Jonah Bromwich

Produced by an unknown Portuguese duo named Mendes &amp; Alçada, they had but that lone single to their credit. A bit of digging revealed that one half of that duo, Tiago Miranda, was quite a busy producer in his own right. Soon after, his tracks turned up on labels ranging from Italians Do It Better to Japan’s Ene, from Prins Thomas’ Internasjonal Spesial to DFA, while his band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30322-gala-drop/"" target=""_blank"">Gala Drop</a> was beginning to garner some notice as well (though Miranda has since left that group). While the labels may have been varied, Tiago's adept nature for crafting tracks that could be leftfield disco, acid, or psychedelic dub house connected them all.</p>
<p><i>Ecstasy &amp; Release</i>-- released under the name TNT Subhead-- marks Miranda's first full-length effort. But his name appears nowhere on the album sleeve or on the record labels; there are no credits whatsoever. And judging by the cover art, it looks more like a lost agitprop 80s post-punk record than something suited for dancing. It seems destined to be mis-filed, which may be what Miranda wants.</p>
<p>The music itself seems unwilling to be beholden to any one genre. Opener “Story of the Eye” namechecks the sexually-kinked novella by Georges Bataille, but favors the smooth minimal pulses of something like Steve Reich's <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i>, bolstered with chimes, rattles, and some live drums. The textures are enthralling although the track builds only to drain away slowly. The incessant, anxious hi-hats on “Can’t Relax” fall somewhere between “Vote for Miles” and “Someone Great” and make the song feel overly caffeinated and on-edge.</p>
<p>It leads into the album’s squelching standout track, “Icelberg”, which thrills even though it never quite settles into being electro or acid, its icy arpeggios meeting a heavily-reverbed guitar line that warms it ever so slightly. The title track repeats “We all need love” ad infinitum, giving it the feel of an early Chicago house track, though the rock guitar nudges it beyond simple pastiche.</p>
<p>The second half of the album brightens its tone ever so slightly. “Think of Sex But Not of You” uses a bowed cello and a stand-up bass line to erect a sleek and spacy house track out, soon building up enough steam to sound like one of Larry Heard’s more jazz-tinged productions. A more primitive drum machine pushes “The Book of Yes” along, adding analog synth gurgles, bloops, and a touch of acid along the way.</p>
<p>It sounds like Miranda repurposed the acid line he deployed on his excellent leftfield 2010 single “Motorcycles” (a track that James Murphy played out often at that time) for penultimate track, “Arp K Found”. Yanking out the live drums and churning guitar line of the original and layering more synth washes across it instead, it doesn’t work quite as well.<i> Ecstasy &amp; Release</i> makes me pine for a compilation that might truly bring all of Miranda's myriad productions in one handy package. But as a debut, it's an encouraging sign, no matter what genre he decides to go into next.</p></div>"|18218.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18218-tnt-subhead-ecstasy-release/|7.3|Andy Beta

There were echoes of a once-thriving industry in there, harking back to a time of money being endlessly funneled into lavish studio complexes, sometimes in aid of wild vanity projects. <i>RAM</i> added a whole other level of expenditure in service of the concept of retro. You can buy all the vintage amps and instruments you want, loot endless thrift stores to get just the right period ruffle on your shirt. But can you hire the guy who played drums on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a>'s <i>Off the Wall</i>? In a sense it's a grand folly, an ill-fitting match for the way music is mostly consumed at this point in time. You're not likely to hear the nuances of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ludwig"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bob Ludwig</a>'s mastering job through tinny laptop speakers, crappy earbuds, low bitrate MP3s, and streaming YouTube clips.</p>
<p>Of course the sheer ambition of <i>RAM</i> is a large part of its appeal, a big group purposefully acting big to flesh out the music as they imagine it in their heads. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/"">Nicolas Jaar</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30070-darkside/"">Darkside</a> project, here renamed Daftside, take all that aspiration and siphon out every drop of it from the original source. This album, really just a series of clips uploaded to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51260-listen-darkside-nicolas-jaar-remixes-daft-punks-random-access-memories-in-full/"">Soundcloud</a>, remixes <i>RAM</i> in full, deconstructing it to resemble a thin, hollowed-out version of its original self. It's an internet-redux model of Daft Punk's work, a scratchy counterpart that sees virtue in the kind of ultra-low production values and consumption models that <i>RAM</i> veers away from. The first half of Daftside's ""Give Life Back to Music"" is positively emaciated, its drums falling flat, its cymbal splashes resembling old Casio presets caked in cheap distortion. It's the kind of thing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_JR_Robinson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John ""J.R."" Robinson</a>, Daft Punk’s ludicrously accomplished drummer on the original track, must have nightmares about.</p>
<p>It's difficult to judge exactly how long Jaar and his musical partner, <a href=""http://harringtone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dave Harrington</a>, spent on this work (probably not much, considering how quickly they turned it around). So the tweaking is minimal at times, with pitches shifted resolutely down and that crackly flimsiness recurring as a theme. There was already something of a sad-robot motif to some of <i>RAM</i>, and the downturned atmosphere here emphasizes it further. ""Get Lucky"" sounds positively bluesy at times, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell</a>'s vocal reduced to a drunken slur, making its central refrain sound more like a lost hope than a promise of good times ahead. It's indicative of this project's inclination for taking big moments and making them small, pushing them inward. Even <i>RAM</i>'s centerpiece, the Paul Williams-fronted ""Touch"", is pulled out of its its wide open space, given a minimal techno makeover, then shunted to the penultimate slot in the running order.</p>
<p>Daftside's ability to find something else in this music doesn't just stretch to them reducing the mood to a set of internal post-club jams. At times they're looking for the direct inverse in mood, turning the gloomy ""Game of Love"" up in pace so it resembles a shuffling disco tune. For ""Contact"" they open with a gnarled take on the noise bursts at its close, placing it at the start of the tracklisting in a move that mirrors <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>'s positioning of the similarly bracing wake-up call ""Nil Admirari"" on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14326-returnal/""><i>Returnal</i></a>. Surprisingly, the material that seems more in Jaar's orbit-- the slow-build electronics of ""Motherboard"", the pulsing ""Giorgio by Moroder""-- produce less satisfying results, with the former a mess of runaway electronics and the latter a tangle of empty loops. ""Doin' It Right"" is better, taking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"">Panda Bear</a>'s escalating vocal and turning it into a wonderfully ugly set of belches.</p>
<p>Amusingly, for something that often deliberately drags so hard, Daftside simply brush over one of the <i>RAM</i> tracks that taps into that mood, turning the indifferent ""Lose Yourself to Dance"" into a two-second vocal passage then moving on. That sense of play, resembling Jaar and Harrington poking Daft Punk with a stick then gleefully running away, is partly what makes this a far greater work than standard remix albums. At times they're looking for nuances in the original, small threads they can pick up and take somewhere else. Elsewhere they're just having fun, acting on instincts, never over-awed by the material. Certainly there's an overall feel of taking all of Daft Punk's expansion and turning in a low-rent version of it, an Off-Off-Broadway version constructed in a cardboard pyramid patched together with tape and glue. Jaar's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15122-space-is-only-noise/""><i>Space is Only Noise</i></a> worked from a similar mix of nuttiness and constraint.

Technically, Liam’s band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29539-beady-eye/"" target=""_blank"">Beady Eye</a> and Noel’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29794-noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds/"" target=""_blank"">High Flying Birds</a> aren’t side projects-- we're supposed to believe that these indifferently received endeavors are decisive steps away from their busted-up partnership in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"">Oasis</a>, which was still one of the world’s more reliable arena-filling rock bands at the time of its dissolution in 2009. But Liam and Noel can’t help sounding like incomplete halves in search of a lost whole when apart. On Beady Eye’s 2011 debut <i>Different Gear Still Speeding, </i>Liam had the attitude but not the songs; Noel’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15944-noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds-st/"" target=""_blank""><i>High Flying Birds </i></a>had the songs but not the attitude. Two years later, it’s safe to assume that anyone who still cares about either one of these guys would rather hear them together than on their own, trying in vain to compensate for the other brother’s absence.  </p>
<p>But the Gallaghers are nothing if not stubborn, which means the world will have to wait at least one more album/tour cycle before the inevitable reunion cash-in. With Beady Eye’s new <i>BE</i>, Liam gamely goes through the motions of progressing beyond the rudimentary Oasisisms of <i>Different Gear </i>by employing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>’s Dave Sitek as producer<i>. </i>The results are about what you’d expect: <i>BE </i>is somewhat more adventurous than <i>Different Gear</i>, and certainly more dynamic. The horns laid over the menacing introduction of “Flick of the Finger” provide a touch of spice to Beady Eye’s meat-and-potatoes stew, and the ambient noise that pads out psych-tinged rockers like “Soul Love” ostensibly improves on the straight-forward lumbering that distinguishes long stretches of the first Beady Eye record. On paper, it’s a “better” album. So why is <i>BE </i>less enjoyable than <i>Different Gear</i>? Could it be that hiring a “smart” producer like Sitek was exactly the opposite of what this pleasurably dumb band requires?</p>
<p>For all of the finesse that Sitek brings to <i>BE</i>, he might’ve been better off just making sure that the guitars were turned up loud enough. “I’m Just Saying” boasts the record’s most magnetic riff, clanking out of a burst of feedback and arrogantly barreling forward on supercharged power chords. It’s exactly the sort of song that should kill on a Beady Eye record, and yet on <i>BE </i>it’s a little too clean, even antiseptic. This is a band that needs to sound a little blurry and blown-out; Beady Eye’s broad strokes and bombastic flourishes are more satisfying when you can’t make out the specifics. Sitek’s pristine production only highlights how half-baked many of these songs are, especially lyrically. “Second Bite of the Apple” is a potentially fun snotball of classic Liam Gallagher insouciance, but lines like, “Shake my tree/ Where’s the apple for me/ Tickle my feet with the enemy” (or possibly, the <i>NME</i>)  are better when vaguely heard than comprehended.</p>
<p>“Second Bite of the Apple” was written by Gem Archer, one-third of Beady Eye’s songwriting triumvirate that also includes Gallagher and Andy Bell. It’s a mild surprise that Gallagher’s songs are the best on <i>BE </i>in a walk-- it’s downright shocking how much he sounds like his brother on the pretty album closer “Start Anew”, a budget-minded “Champagne Supernova” with killer echo-y drum sounds lifted from John Lennon’s Phil Spector-produced solo records. If Liam seems hamstrung as a rocker on <i>BE, </i>at least he’s showing more promise as a balladeer. If that’s another ploy to convince Noel that he can be replaced, and therefore should cancel this solo career silliness and revive Oasis, <i>BE </i>might serve a purpose after all.</p></div>"|18206.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18206-beady-eye-be/|5.8|Steven Hyden

His music has a similarly blinding elevator pitch quality: In just a few short years, the 23-year-old has assembled a formidable catalog of colorful, catchy, and impressive mixtapes. His latest, <i>Kilt 2</i>, doubles down on all of his strongest and most likeable qualities: Largely self-produced, high-energy, and creative, it shows Iamsu! continuing to transform from a promising, agreeable Bay Area rap figure into a burgeoning star.</p>
<p>On <i>Kilt 2</i>, Su positions himself as an enterprising, funny young trend synthesizer, working hard to summarize the rowdy sprawl of his city's rap music riches and prep them for cross-country consumption. There are pieces of nearly every current Bay Area rap style floating through <i>Kilt</i>; DJ Mustard's infectiously bright and simple ratchet sound; hyphy, as the sound has come to be defined by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"" target=""_blank"">E-40</a> over the past decade (""On Citas,"" which brings Mistah F.A.B. and gravel-voiced Keak Da Sneak for good measure); the mournful, soul-inflected mob music of Husalah, Joe Blow, the Jacka and others in the Livewire/AR/Mob Figaz axis. ""The Science"", which overflows with wooly saxophone, talkbox, jazz flute, and grand piano, is a rich <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4883-dj-quik/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Quik</a> homage. It sounds like an Easter Egg hunt meant only for Bay Area rap nerd-aficionados, but Su neatly corrals all of this context, shuffles it, and spits it out, stamped with earnest, clever, likeable raps. </p>
<p>You could call it Su's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8767-the-college-dropout/"" target=""_blank""><i>College Dropout</i></a> impulse; he probably wouldn't mind. ""Found bravery in my bravado/ Trying to live up to that rapper from Chicago,"" he raps on ""The Science"". On ""Best Thing Yet"", he spells it out even more clearly: ""Bumpin <i>The College Dropout</i>, tryin' to rhyme like him,"" he says. Su has a few Westian qualities-- his ability, for one to treat the story of his rap career as an epic hero's journey, with or without the autobiographical nitty-gritty to sell it. ""I recognize the uncertainty of a career in music, but I still handle it perfectly, "" Su says on ""Citas"", and boasts on ""Father God"" that ""I could go my whole lifetime without your cosign."" The quality he shares most with West, though, is his burning, evident desire to reach all demographics; on the feather-light ""Hipster Girls"", Su raps about Instagram likes and Tumblr posts, somehow without losing everyone in the room. ""Float"" and ""Let Go"" are pillowy, dazed love jams that gently bump pool rafts with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a>.</p>
<p>The production, when not handled directly by Su, comes from other members of his Invasion crew, a rotating cast of producers that have distinct specialties: P-Lo sources the spare, darker beats; the pinwheeling, airy numbers come from Kuya Beats. Iamsu!'s own production, however, is the most ambitious and musical-- his beat for ""On Citas"" melts, halfway through, into a second section of breathy female vocals and diaphanous keys. Even when it's dark and menacing, like ""Father God"", there is a nimble snap to Su's music. His reedy, modest voice makes him sound like a cousin to Khalifa, but his rapping is deceptively complicated, stepping nimbly in and out of double and triple time and running light, high-stepping circles around the beat. He's not quite charismatic enough yet to match his outsized ambitions, but <i>Kilt 2</i> is another solid step up his ladder. </p></div>"|18236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18236-iamsu-kilt-ii/|7.5|Jayson Greene

This isn't to take away from the EPs and singles they released before this LP, because they contained good songs. It's just that they were still eclipsed by frontman Riley Gale and company's whirling dervish stage presence. There's a reason they've toured plenty with their west coast pals, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28767-trash-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Trash Talk</a>: they play bridge shows, they make liberal use of gang vocals, their fans are very into circle pits, and, hell, they shout out straightedge hardcore bands on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/powertripT"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their Facebook page</a>. But this debut eight-song collection, their first release for Southern Lord, is such a strong record that you could never see Power Trip live and still understand what makes them special.</p>
<p>The Dallas, TX, quintet play crossover, i.e. thrash that draws from hardcore punk. The guitars, placed up front, are clean, dexterous, and fast; the vocals and drums, in the back, are draped in sludge and reverb. Those elements will, at times, remind you of the darker side of the old-school thrash spectrum (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"" target=""_blank"">Slayer</a>), but the spirit of this stuff pulls more from the hardcore scene, like their Astoria forebears Leeway or, on the burlier side, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30560-cro-mags/"" target=""_blank"">Cro-Mags</a>. Unlike other contemporary thrash bands, Power Trip create a legitimately violent atmosphere, and don't go around wearing sleeveless jean jackets with the front of their baseball caps turned up. They sound less like they're here to party, and more like they want to kick your ass.</p>
<p>You could safely say Power Trip are a punk band. Their whiplash fight song, ""Power Trip"", includes the lines ""We ride as one/ We’re ruled by none,"" and you believe them.<i> Manifest </i>closer, ""The Hammer of Doubt"", was originally out, in different form, on a 2010 compilation called <i>America's Hardcore</i>. They've covered Prong. They could easily cover <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">Black Flag</a>. They remind me of my early days in high school when I was coming out of a steady diet of hardcore and getting into bands like Metallica, D.R.I, Suicidal Tendencies, and Anthrax.</p>
<p>The music on <i>Manifest Decimation</i> is bleak, dirty, heavy. It's also very catchy. At any given moment, Gale can sound like Lemmy fronting Cro-Mags, Discharge, or Exodus. At other times, he locates a grizzlier tone that evokes guys wearing corpsepaint. There are samples about death and Texas from movies like<i> Robocop 2</i> and <i>Blood Simple</i>. The Italian artist Paolo ""Madman"" Girardi offers detailed old school apocalyptic metal cover art. The lyrics deal with government and religious suppression like so: ""Histories trapped in illusion, who sees through who?/ For every mindless vision of who owns the truth/ For every one who spoke out, thousands were slain/ Torture and bloodshed in the sake of some holy name."" That's the classic side of things, but while <i>Manifest Decimation</i> does sounds vintage (the chug-chug-chug, the whammy-bar abusing solos), these guys aren't stuck in 1986.</p>
<p>What helps makes this album great, outside of the excellent riffs and choruses, is the way Power Trip mix in flourishes that place <i>Manifest Decimation</i> firmly in the present. (In that sense, you'll also think about another Texas band, the now defunct Iron Age.) There's nothing obvious; it's little touches, like the weirdo echo effect on Gale's voice throughout. The album opens with a blast of swirling feedback and ominous synth tones, something threaded throughout the album via brief, almost industrial snippets. The feeling's picked up in some of those headier vocal effects, too-- the phased pan on ""Conditioned to Death"" (which features some great early Metallica riffing), the disembodied backing vocals on the frantic ""Murderer's Row"" (complete with some Slayer-like soloing). It adds to the urgency and intensity, and also sets them apart. That said, none of it would matter if they weren't writing songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15272-power-trip-manifest-decimation/"" target=""_blank"">the swarming title track</a> or the Motörhead-banging ""Heretic's Fork"".</p>
<p>Recently, people who take metal seriously have spent some time talking about whether or not thrash is dead, or if we're actually in the midst of a thrash revival. Power Trip have found a way to create something new by pulling from the past. In that way, it feels like they exist on both sides of the argument without giving a shit either way.</p></div>"|17893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17893-power-trip-manifest-decimation/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

It was a couple years after the overthrow of Haile Selassie by Mengistu Haile Mariam, and Mengistu’s Derg government had applied the brakes to Addis Ababa’s nightlife, making it much harder for a working band to make a living. Music was still being made in abundance, though, and cassettes ultimately made it a lot easier to duplicate and distribute it. “Muziqawi Silt” surfaced in collector circles in the U.S. and Europe in the 90s and was canonized by a 2003 <i>Ethiopiques</i> volume, and it’s since become one of the tiny handful of songs that non-Ethiopians use as a gateway into the country’s music. Antibalas even covered it. </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31413-hailu-mergia/"">Hailu Mergia</a> was the keyboardist for Walias Band. His organ playing is one of the only things a lot of people know about Ethiopian music. Walias Band was more important than just that one track, though. When the band arrived on the scene, the typical arrangement was for the venue-- usually a hotel-- to provide a band with instruments. Walias broke that mold by buying their own and working out contracts with the venues they played. In the early 80s, during a tour of the United States, Mergia and a few other members decided not to return home. That was the end of the band, but they’d made their mark back home. </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">A few years after moving to the U.S., Mergia decided to record an album that merged the sounds of his youth with modern technology. Working alone, he assembled a drum machine, a Rhodes piano, a Yamaha DX7, and his accordion, and got to work arranging old Ethiopian songs for this mostly modern palette. The results are striking and unusual. If <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"" target=""_blank"">Cluster</a> had been from Ethiopia instead of Germany, this is probably about what they would have sounded like. Mergia uses the Yamaha to make his buzzy bass lines, fills in chords and texture with the Rhodes, and then solos over the top, alternately on the accordion or the Yamaha DX7, in an inimitably Ethiopian style. The sound is spare and unaffected, the drum programming never deviating during any song, though he sometimes augments the rhythmic push with vocals halfway between beatboxing and chanting.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In addition to the fluttering modal melodies, there are other distinctly Ethiopian signatures running through the music, particularly in the triple meters and three-against-four rhythms of the songs. “Belew Beduby” stomps along on a swaying polyrhythm on a par with anything you’ll hear from early 70s Addis, while “Hebo Lale” modifies that beat a bit for more of a boogie feel, aided by a faster tempo. At the other end of the spectrum, “Sewnetuwa” drifts along on an almost eight-bit-sounding bass line, with Yamaha DX7 and accordion dueling on top.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The overall effect of the album is difficult to describe. The music is simple and straightforward, accomplished but not showy. It feels at once rural, nostalgic, and futuristic. Replace the drum machine with people clapping, and you’d be a hair’s breadth from an ethnographic recording. Drum machines and synthesizers are common ingredients of Ethiopian pop music today, but not in the same way they’re used here. Perhaps one of the things that sets this apart from other Ethiopian pop music is the fact that it was made in solitude, and specifically out of longing for a vanished past. It’s introverted in a way very little other music from the country is. It’s also not quite like anything else you’ve ever heard.</p></div>"|18162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18162-hailu-mergia-hailu-mergia-and-his-classical-instrument/|7.4|Joe Tangari

It’s terrible timing for any pop album; for the former backpack rapper who found unexpected mainstream pop success who went into the studio to attempt a singular, definitive artistic statement, it's bound to set up some unfair comparisons. There’s also a vaguely beefy line in “Heaven’s Afternoon” about how Wale wears Givenchy but doesn’t wear kilts that doesn’t help the situation.</p>
<p>That said, the fact that Wale’s decided to release such a left-field pop rap record at this point in his career is respectably daring. In fact, it’s probably the most daring thing about <i>The Gifted</i>. For all its differences from Wale's closest chart competitors, the music here (at least on the first half of the record) follows a path that was cleared as far back as the 90s: using the warm and lushly organic sound of peak-era Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder to reconnect hip-hop with a soulful revolutionary legacy that it turned away from when MCs started going in over 808 beats. It's not original, but it's a good path to follow. (Chicago rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31352-tree/"" target=""_blank"">Tree</a> recently used a similar approach on his mixtape, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18133-tree-sunday-school-ii-when-church-lets-out/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sunday School II: When Church Lets Out</i></a>, probably one of the best rap records that’ll be released this year.)</p>
<p>The music on <i>The Gifted</i> sounds fantastic, with intricately arranged keys and strings, stacks of soul and gospel-inspired backup vocals, and deep, rubbery bass lines. The problem is that Wale and his team made a really decent soul rap album without a rapper soulful enough to carry it. He’s a capable, sometimes personable MC, but he’s not an especially compelling one. His approach to the album’s more explicitly soul-oriented tracks is to intersperse his library of 2013 rap cliches about his personal struggle to success with the occasional line about social injustice. The combination is a jumbled, awkward mess, capped by a wasted guest appearance by Jerry Seinfeld on an excruciatingly unfunny dialogue with Wale on <i>The Gifted</i>'s outro. He’s attempting to tap into the magic that Marvin and Stevie created back then, but his understanding of what they did is bafflingly shallow. Wale seems to think that those records succeeded by their string arrangements and keyboard tones, and with accurate enough reproductions of those at his fingertips, he breezes past the part about writing lyrics that resonate with an audience enough to rattle their whole worldview. After days of listening to <i>The Gifted</i> on nearly constant rotation I can’t remember a single line from it.</p>
<p>In the cruelest of ironies, the album only really starts to come together when Wale abandons the high concept conscious stuff and goes straight for the pop jugular. “Clappers”, the strongest track here, is a big, club-shaking bass anthem about girls with big butts. It’s absolutely ignorant as fuck, but at least it’s fun and, more vital, straight to the point. Wale may not be a great thinker, but he’s an accomplished entertainer who seems to have inherited some of the unabashed “anything to please the crowd” attitude from go-go groups in his hometown of Washington, D.C. When he hits his stride here you can almost see him on stage, gleefully controlling a packed audience.</p>
<p>What seems to be the main purpose of the record is to elevate Wale beyond the level of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>’ reliable second-stringer, a guy who’s capable of dropping the occasional strip club anthem in between a steady string of unremarkable features on pop songs. “Clappers” proves that when he embraces that job he’s actually really good at it. But if he wants to be taken as a serious artist like the ones he spends most of the record emulating, he’s going to have to start taking some real chances and get real far out of the box, out to place where people are known to wear kilts.</p></div>"|18215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18215-wale-the-gifted/|5.1|Miles Raymer

So is the list of bands that can get away with replacing everybody except one (non-singing) member. Fortunately for remarkable Dutch band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1378-the-ex/"" target=""_blank"">the Ex</a>, they're much more interested in expanding the horizons of their music than they are in repeating their past: they've generally discarded their entire old repertoire whenever their line-up has changed. And <i>Enormous Door</i> is an acrobatic, ferocious record, a welcome burst of electric noise and squealing horns from a group whose power and flexibility keep growing with time.</p>
<p>The only remaining member of the Ex's original 1979 lineup is guitarist Terrie Hessels; vocalist G.W. Sok left in 2009, and was replaced by the band's longtime associate Arnold de Boer. (De Boer's sly, mutterering croon isn't quite as commanding as Sok's martial two-note bark, although his piercing guitar tone is an excellent addition to the band. He also gets points for writing lyrics about recent research in embodied cognition.) But the trio of Hessels, guitarist Andy Moor, and drummer Katherina Bornefeld has been the core of the Ex since they hit their stride around 1990. They're a hellaciously tight, tough rhythm section-- they haven't had a bass guitarist since the mid-2000s, but both Moor and Hessels have started playing baritone guitar-- and most of their songs are built on Bornefeld's floor-rattling grooves.</p>
<p>What the Ex have learned over the past few decades is that they thrive on collaboration, especially with melodists from musical traditions that don't have much to do with their punk rock roots, and that they've got a serious taste for certain kinds of African music. A lot of their best records have been made with guests, from their two albums with the late avant-garde cellist Tom Cora to their recent recordings with septuagenarian Ethiopian jazz saxophonist Getatchew Mekuria. Since 2010, they've occasionally performed with a shifting quartet of horn players under the name Brass Unbound-- here, it's Ken Vandermark, Mats Gustafsson, Wolter Wierbos, and Roy Paci, all of whom have formidable reputations in the jazz world.</p>
<p><i>Enormous Door</i> is essentially a document of their live act from the Brass Unbound shows: a series of big, rolling rhythms that let the horn section switch off between tightly arranged charts and headlong free-jazz battles, or let one style mutate into the other. De Boer sings on most of them; his English-language lyrics touch on consumer culture and unadventurous vacations, but they're mostly vehicles for his voice to be another rhythm instrument. (Bornefeld gets a turn at the mic too: a revved-up cover of Mahmoud Ahmed's mid-70s Ethiopian love song ""Belomi Benna"" with enthusiastically rolled Rs and near-hardcore double time on the choruses.) The one song reprised here from their first album with de Boer, 2010's <i>Catch My Shoe</i>, is ""Bicycle Illusion"", which is distinctly improved both by having spent a couple of years in their repertoire and by letting Brass Unbound augment the noise attack of its final few minutes.</p>
<p>And, at the end of the album, the Ex finally give us a glimpse of their past. ""Theme from Konono No. 2"" is the second song they've written around the Congolese band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2384-konono-n1/"" target=""_blank"">Konono No. 1</a>'s signature Morse-code riff; the first was on 2004's <i>Turn</i>, and a staple of their live shows around that time, so this is a real trip down memory lane for them. That ""Theme from Konono"" was an exercise in constantly building, monomaniacal intensity, but from the moment Brass Unbound stroll into ""No. 2"", it becomes a different kind of song: not a demonstration of sweaty power, but a raucous celebration of how much this band has changed, and what its alliances have given it. </p></div>"|18214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18214-the-ex-brass-unbound-enormous-door/|8.1|Douglas Wolk

He depends on this persona for his scatterbrained takes on house and electro; it takes more than a little charm and panache to get someone up on that table with you. So it's problematic that it feels like Aguayo's laboring for long stretches of his third album, <i>The Visitor</i>. Aguayo has, in the past, mixed in noisier, less friendly tracks, but on <i>The Visitor</i> these tracks are more prominent, busier, and messier.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>The Visitor</i> deepens Aguayo's dependence on his voice as he steers away from merely assisting dance tracks to carrying song structures. For an inveterate weirdo, Aguayo has been involved in a surprising number of smashes: the catchy-despite-itself <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11539-rollerskate-radio-edit/"" target=""_blank"">""Rollerskate""</a>, his vocal turn on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"" target=""_blank"">Battles</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12141-ice-cream-ft-matias-aguayo/"" target=""_blank"">""Ice Cream""</a>, his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Koze</a>-remixed <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wmyQl7yvSc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Minimal""</a> and its spiritual companion, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CMLi4ymao0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Walter Neff""</a>. On his best tracks, the rhythms act as a centrifugal force, an axis around which his voice and melodic detritus can spin. Too many songs on <i>The Visitor</i> fail to establish this center, and the result is an album of oddball psychedelia with its wacky creator foregrounded.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Unfortunately, we've reached the point of diminishing returns on Aguayo's imagination, as <i>The Visitor</i> veers from style to style recklessly; <i>The Visitor</i> was recorded with a host of South American artists, many of them residents of the Cómeme label. ""Dear Inspector"", for example, is a long, gently tumbling pop song that sounds like someone in the Elephant Six collective bought an MPC sampler. After dragging ""Dear Inspector"" out for nearly eight minutes, Aguayo abruptly switches modes on ""By the Graveyard"", a reverb-heavy storm that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"" target=""_blank"">Can</a>'s more aggressive moments, a style he revisits on the album's clanging, industrial closer, ""A Certain Spirit"". These tracks have plenty of rhythm, but Aguayo can't seem to find it. He shrouds himself in effects and shouts the songs' titles, retaining none of his casual tunefulness.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Aguayo has trouble balancing his whimsical impulses with his aggressive ones throughout <i>The Visitor</i>, like he can't decide if he wants to flirt or brood. The chant-heavy ""Llegó El Don"" is domineering, its thwacking rhythms pointed right at the listener. ""Levantate Diegors"" busies itself with noise, unleashing dozens of small rhythmic flourishes around its bossy, bass-y vocals. It's not just that these tracks are less fun, it's that they're not compellingly deviant either. The big, evil synth line that anchors the creeping ""Las Cruces"" feels like a better mix of Aguayo's new style and troublemaking instincts.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Aguayo is better, too, when his tracks are less cluttered. He captures a little of his old magic on ""Una Fiesta Diferente"", a vocal-heavy stew where he and some background singers spin an easy tune out of bilingual lyrics. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15369-el-sucu-tucu/"" target=""_blank"">El Sucu Tucu</a>"" is frantic but focused, with Aguayo's staccato vocals matching the song's eager snares. ""Rrrrr"" opens the album with a stupid, inviting bassline, and the chorus's purring, rolling ""r""'s are vintage Aguayo. Aguayo's music is brave and increasingly complex, but it's worth wondering how well these impulses are serving his tracks. There's potential in <i>The Visitor</i>'s mix of electro, new wave, and pop, but it's obscuring or distorting Aguayo's personality, which is the engine that has driven his songs for so long.</p></div>"|18221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18221-matias-aguayo-the-visitor/|5.9|Andrew Gaerig

The Jones brothers still make up the core of Spectrals, but new record <i>Sob Story</i> features a much more prominent name behind the boards: J.R. White, the bassist/producer who formerly made up one half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Girls</a>. The band flew from their Yorkshire home base to White's own San Francisco for much of the recording of <i>Sob Story</i>, and dipped into White's Rolodex, too: <i>Sob Story</i> features session musicians on guitar, pedal steel, and bass. With capable playing, veteran production, and refined, confident songwriting and vocals from Jones, <i>Sob Story</i>'s best cuts sparkle with easy, compact melodicism, a pop rock accomplishment reminiscent of early Girls singles like ""Lust for Life"".</p>
<p>Jones' vocal improvement is one of the most obvious differences between <i>Bad Penny</i> and <i>Sob Story</i>, noticeable from the record's first seconds; a voice that was serviceable and nondescript two years ago has bloomed into a wonderfully textured, indelible croon, rich and distinct. It has a fair bit of range too, comfortable carrying the scruffy strut of ""A Heartbeat Behind"" and the expansive, cutting ""Milky Way"" in equal measure. On standout ""Karaoke"", backed by a pinwheeling guitar line, kinetic percussion, and sighing backing harmonies, Jones admits, ""I don't think I was really cut out for this/ Who is?"" It's delivered like a conversation with a close friend at a crowded pub, and it's remarkably effective, a testament to the newfound strength of Jones' voice and his knack for shrugging, affable tunes.</p>
<p><i>Sob Story</i>'s other highlights are similarly effective. The album is at its best when Jones delivers brisk, bright rock with endearing hooks, whether it's through the simple stomp and sliding minor-key harmonies of opener ""Let Me Cave In"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"" target=""_blank"">Big Star</a>-like power-pop love songs like ""Limousine"". A solid sense of humor shines through the melodies, too: on ""Something to Cry About"", he's imploring a lover to make him upset as fodder for new material, and on ""Blue Whatever"" he laments that a long-distance relationship might as well be taking place across galaxies rather than cities.</p>
<p>Things begin to lag when Jones drops the tempo and tries his hand at balladry. The transition from the sweet, rollicking guitar pop of ""Karaoke"" into the slow, pedal steel-laden title track is like riding your bike on a gorgeous, sunny day, only to steer into a thick mud patch; eerie, croaked closer ""In a Bad Way"" ends the album on an unfortunate, ponderous note. ""Friend Zone"" is just what you'd expect from a song with that title, a concept that requires pinpoint execution, and Jones' well-meaning effort falls short. It's too bad, because the components making up these slower cuts-- heavy pedal steel lines, emotive vocals-- are mostly gorgeous in their own right, but they falter as part of dragging wholes. But even in <i>Sob Story</i>'s weaker moments, it's hard not to root for the Jones brothers. They've managed to cultivate a real sense of personality over their first two records on the backs of good-intentioned charm, lyrical wit and relatability, and Louis' evolving, idiosyncratic vocals. That likable and unassuming identity encourages fond glances toward any minor missteps in the meantime.</p></div>"|18241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18241-spectrals-sob-story/|6.5|Jamieson Cox

As long as we have Noisem, that darker balance will be struck.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Formerly known as Necropsy, Noisem is a quintet of teenagers from Baltimore who are casually making their older contemporaries look bad by comparison. Their debut album, <i>Agony Defined</i> (released by the consistently good Baltimore micro-indie <a href=""http://www.a389records.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A389</a>) takes a basic thrash template, adds a generous measure of death metal, forges the alloy into something the size and shape of a railroad spike, and then spends 26 minutes hammering it between your eyes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s a remarkably lean album, even by thrash’s typically minimalist standards. Overdubs are rare, although producer Kevin Bernsten makes sure that the barest moments hit with the same slab-like, bass-heavy density as the louder ones. </span>Noisem’s songwriting is just as uncomplicated, generally consisting of a riff for the verses, a slight variation for the chorus, and maybe a couple-bar breakdown. The only parts that verge on ostentation are the frequent guitar solos, whammy bar-abusing divebombs that are technically virtuosic and, more importantly, evil enough to justify their existence as something more than simple flash. It's a familiar formula, especially from the first couple of Slayer records, which came closest to perfecting the style.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's by no means inaccurate to compare <i>Agony Defined</i> to Slayer-- they scratch a similar itch-- but the band Noisem resembles most might be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/"" target=""_blank"">Iceage</a>. Both groups consist of young musicians who despite-- or perhaps because of-- their youth are able to drill down to the core of a genre that’s been accumulating stylistic cruft for the past couple decades, rediscovering its most basic appeal. Noisem comes close to locating the ideal of a death-tinged thrash band the same way that Iceage does with the concept of a hardcore band. Like Iceage, Noisem's vocalist, Tyler Carnes, has an approach a little bit weirder and more individual than the style’s used to, often sounding like a melodic death rattle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There’s some footage from Noisem’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI8EggXrW30"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">set at the most recent Maryland Death Fest</a> that proves beyond doubt that <i>Agony Defined</i> is no fluke. From the video evidence they’re as scarilyy good live as they are on record. The thrash scene is still a niche, and Noisem’s altogether a little more purely metal than the type of band that gets much traction outside of a specialist audience. But if there’s one metal band worth paying attention to right now, this is it. I know it’s a greedy thought to have when I’m still nowhere near tired of their first record, but I can’t wait to see what they do next.</p></div>"|18233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18233-noisem-agony-defined/|7.6|Miles Raymer

Its remixes came off less like mandatory singles life extensions than a glimpse into what these gothy tracks got up to <i>after</i> the witching hour. On <i>Olympia</i>, the main change from <i>Feel It Break</i> isn't adding beats but adding more in general: the core trio doubled to a six-piece, bringing more layers to Katie Stelmanis' songwriting, and pushing it in a more house-inspired synth-pop direction.</p>
<p>It's an obvious-seeming move these days, but Austra was close enough to this sound previously that it's not too jarring a development. Plus, they push in that direction with an unusual sonic palette: sparkly harp solos, deadpan early-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">Knife</a> riffs, vocals that sound druidic, even guttural, including New Age-evoking morose choral drones. Much continues to be made of Stelmanis's opera training, but opera's just about the only sound that <i>isn't</i> represented here. It takes a while to get familiar with these sounds, which seems deliberate. ""You'll never know me, I'll never know you,"" as Stelmanis sings on ""Sleep"", outright repudiating the notion of instant dancefloor connection.</p>
<p>Stelmanis' solo work would turn single lines-- ""be your own company,"" ""join us""-- into manifestos, a tendency for studies on a single riff that carried through into <i>Feel It Break</i>. <i>Olympia</i> sounds far more expansive and a little less removed-- ""We Become"" even grooves. Though opener ""What We Done?"" has the bass throb and synth counterpoint of a late-night dance hit, it doesn't do much else, and vocalist Katie Stelmanis sings her melody as if what she's hearing is a requiem. ""Annie (Oh Muse, You)"", the noisiest, synth-clappingest track here, mutters where there might have been melodies. Lead single ""Home"" is built on a house piano riff any of today's revivalists would envy, but it takes its sweet time getting there. </p>
<p>Stelmanis has said she listened to a lot of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"" target=""_blank"">Cat Power</a> while recording <i>Olympia</i>, and while<i> </i>nothing here sounds anywhere near as stark, the lyrics often do, and lead appropriately tense, nervy sounding songs. There are still hints of <i>Feel It Break</i>'s aesthetic-heavy mysticism, but in general, <i>Olympia </i>is an album where a title like ""You Changed My Life"" is the sort to be delivered over sincere piano. (Over a low-end-heavy chug, but still.) ""Forgive Me"", a plea to an estranged lover or friend, is blunt both lyrically (""What do I have to do to make you forgive me?"") and musically: obsessive, pinprick-tense, desperate for closure. ""Home"" has a similar centerpiece-- ""you know that it hurts me when you don't come home at night""-- and the arrangement <i>sounds </i>like the feverish, sleepless worry that accompanies.</p>
<p>Much of <i>Olympia</i> is disarmingly personal, and some, as usual with Austra, is political-- but not the stuff of Stelmanis and drummer Maya Postepski's previous riot grrl band Galaxy, nor the cinemascope revolution of <i>Shaking the Habitual</i> (another cited inspiration) but something subtler. Throughout <i>Olympia</i>, love is a radical act and heartbreak-- in greater supply here-- a failure of community; but the album<i> </i>doesn’t speak in those abstractions. “Painful Like” addresses bigotry, specifically anti-gay (“We don’t have to marry…. In this town we’ll bury all the minds that clench too tight”), but makes its point through quick flashes of detail (“bruised skin on top of mine”), a startling, candid sort of intimacy<i> Olympia</i>’s remaining tracks grasp for.</p>
<p>Later on comes the album's centerpiece ""I Don't Care (I'm a Man)"", the most fuck-off title Austra's ever written, but the track has no dramatics, just a coolly dispassionate gaze. Stelmanis plays something between a satisfied troll and a coroner surveying the third crime scene of the day, monotone while detailing ""the whimper in her sigh, the softer brutalizing-- but I don't care, I'm a man."" It barely lasts a minute, as if about to break into something more bracing; but the group's going not for shock but shrug value, the sort that gets disturbing once you process what you've just heard. This, it turns out, might be Austra's greatest strength.</p></div>"|18195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18195-austra-olympia/|7.2|Katherine St. Asaph

The song is called “Holy Ghost”, and it’s a lonely monologue featuring her full, beautifully controlled vocals backed by a whispery acoustic guitar strum and a judiciously unobtrusive backing choir. Written by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4879-alan-sparhawk/"">Alan Sparhawk</a>, it appeared on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a>’s recent full-length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17781-low-the-invisible-way/""><i>The Invisible Way</i></a>, which Tweedy also produced. It’s a curious bit of synergy, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> frontman might be guilty of shameless product-placement had Staples’ version not turned out so well. Essentially a cappella, it’s a fine showcase for the vocalist, even if it she obliterates all the ambiguity in the original: This is not about “some holy ghost,” but <i>the</i> Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>What rankles, however, isn’t the song choice but its placement. On <i>The Invisible Way </i>“Holy Ghost” comes late on the first side, sounding like a mournful bit of spiritual questioning. As an album opener here, it’s so wistful and downcast that it sounds like we’ve intruded on Staples’ private prayer. This is not introduction but a benediction. <i>One True Vine</i> takes a while to get going, burdened by curious sequencing that emphasizes the songs’ low-key production and lurching pace. After “Holy Ghost” comes the Tweedy-penned “Every Step”, whose guitar feedback and punctuating stomps sound cheaply ominous. That’s followed by the sluggish <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1505-funkadelic/"">Funkadelic</a> cover “Can You Get to That”, which features a fine bass vocal from Donny Gerrard but never quite gets to that.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14666-you-are-not-alone/"" target=""_blank""><i>You Are Not Alone</i></a>, Staples’ first collaboration with Tweedy from 2010, highlighted the septuagenarian’s still-commanding voice-- which has become all the more powerful with age and experience-- and proved the Wilco frontman could work in styles and genres well beyond indie Americana. Its tone was celebratory, as he showed a light touch in the control room and never burdened Staples’ performances with too much sound or too many studio tricks. <i>You Are Not Alone</i> sounded like a celebration: of a God who had blessed Staples with a long and influential musical career but also of a partnership that seemed to bring out the best in both artists.</p>
<p>That’s an almost impossible act to follow, and by contrast <i>One True Vine</i> sounds subdued, hesitant, downtempo, downcast-- its sentiments more reflective than rousing. It’s not until the fourth track, “Jesus Wept”, that the album really picks up. The song begins with Staples' voice: “My throat quits when I try to say how I long for the day,” she intones. “How I wish there was a way I could see you again.” Staples invests those lines with so much fear and yearning that the sense of loss becomes palpable. It’s an arresting moment, and in the album’s best bit of sequencing, it’s followed by “Far Celestial Shore”, written by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5344-nick-lowe/"">Nick Lowe</a>. An upbeat tune with a sharply strummed guitar propelling its quirky melody, it provides a contented punctuation to “Jesus Wept” by promising a reward in the afterlife for the trials of this life.</p>
<p>As Staples ponders the connections between the earthly and heavenly realms on “What Are They Doing in Heaven Today” and “Sow Good Seeds”, <i>One True Vine</i> shakes off the dust of the first half and rights itself mightily. An old Staples Singers tune, “I Like the Things About Me”, achieves a light, mobile funk, as though set in motion by some great epiphany, and “Woke Up This Morning (With My Mind on Jesus)” establishes a buoyant country-gospel groove punctuated by Staples’ ecstatic hallelujahs.</p>
<p>With its quick pace and infectious hook, “Woke Up This Morning” would make an effective and ebullient album opener, but it works well enough as the impassioned climax before the denouement of the title track. The album intends to trace the believer’s trajectory from doubt (“Holy Ghost”) to certainty (“One True Vine”), which lends the album an introspective quality and invests those final numbers with even more power. Still, <i>One True Vine</i> tarries too long in doubt before finally breaking that dour spell and inviting the listener in on the celebration.</p></div>"|18220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18220-mavis-staples-one-true-vine/|7.4|Stephen M.

This time around, he zeroes in on a brief moment in time in order to explore his feelings about a single act of terror. <i>The End of Silence</i> uses one 5-second sample as its sole building block, which is contorted and manipulated by Herbert and a three-piece band he put together for this recording. That sample is a recording of a pro-Gaddafi plane flying over Libya and dropping its deadly payload, prefigured by a whistle and a cry that hastily warn of the event. In a 2011 <a href=""http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov11/articles/herbert.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> Herbert talked of how we now have ""the capacity to listen to the world in a different way."" This is his way of slowing the world down to make sense of it, in the process creating something that shares the weight of a blood-spattered historical snapshot that provokes an uncomfortably lingering gaze.</p>
<p>There are just three tracks here, the first of which is almost 25-minutes long, while the shortest is just over 10 minutes. Herbert's stated intent is to ""freeze history, press pause, wander around inside the sound."" The music works in direct inverse to the event itself, providing acres of time to stop and think and ponder the consequences. Herbert exploits the silence as much as the act itself, stretching out the sense of anxiety that leads up to the terrifying point of impact. The first part is often mixed so sounds are barely perceptible, forcing you to crank the volume. It's a trick that serves to emphasize the bomb drop when it comes, ripping and tearing through the sound, sometimes bolstered by a thick layer of distortion. The use of silence is transportative, triggering an evaluation of the actions of the people on the ground, posing impossible questions about the thoughts rushing through their heads.</p>
<p>What's striking about this work is how it's set up as the antithesis of 24-hour rolling news culture, where bombs sailing out of the sky are presented with a rote facade, then passed over for the next space-filler on the agenda. It's almost old-fashioned in a way, bringing a layer of meaning back to a singular event, pointing out how we're glazing over atrocities that may have caught the world's attention had they taken place in less media-saturated times. The processing through which Herbert and his band force the sample often make it unrecognizable, but they're careful to imbue their tinkering with feelings of fear, dread, and suffering. It's not exactly music as reportage, but when the pace picks up in the second part it often has the same sense of urgency as someone frantically typing up a report, sending an important dispatch outlining how a small part of the world just changed forever.</p>
<p>Distance plays an important part here, too, with Herbert working in sounds of the natural world, all captured on mics set up outside the barn in Wales where these tracks were recorded. It's a valuable reminder of how far outside the original sound he is, of how alien the whole process of exploring a bomb drop is to the average person. This is an approximation of terror, an artificial rendering of distress constructed in a relatively safe space, where shrapnel becomes a percussion instrument and human cries become neatly layered loops. It adds an air of surreality to the album, at times drawing on that sense of being anesthetized to events like this, where you feel so far removed that it's tough to find meaning amid the blizzard of information. <i>The End of Silence</i> is Herbert effectively tussling with what ""significance"" means at this particular moment in time, in a record that's as much a part of the gathering noise of the 21st century as it is a comment on the constant numbing we've wreaked upon ourselves.</p></div>"|18039.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18039-matthew-herbert-the-end-of-silence/|7.1|Nick Neyland

In 2008, cutesy indie folk was the bomb-- thanks, <i>Juno</i>-- so the group’s use of the entire twee pop toolkit, banjo, ukulele, glockenspiel et al,<i> </i>gave them instant appeal.</p>
<p>Five years and a couple of stylistic rebirths later, Noah and the Whale remain a big draw on the European festival circuit. But in a new era of blockbuster folk rock spearheaded by the likes of Mumford and Sons and the Lumineers, Noah's quaint leanings risk getting lost in the crush. <i>Heart of Nowhere</i> attempts to address this imbalance, building on the mild Tom Petty-isms of their previous effort, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15192-last-night-on-earth/"" target=""_blank"">Last Night on Earth</a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15192-last-night-on-earth/"" target=""_blank""></a></i> and taking a couple of steps closer to stadium-ready territory.</p>
<p><i>Heart of Nowhere</i> is primarily a collection of coming-of-age tales peppered with sensible advice for tormented youths. (It's accompanied by an accompanying 30-minute film of the same name directed by frontman Charlie Fink.) Fink, who moped so candidly after the disintegration of his relationship with former band member <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/9602-laura-marling/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Marling</a> on <i>The First Days of Spring</i>, has taken to counselling kids, offering trite support: “It’s okay to not always be sure exactly where you wanna go” (“Silver and Gold”); “If you can, try and get to know your parents well” (“Now is Exactly the Times”). On “Lifetime”, he hamfistedly pleads with a friend to consider the finality of marriage before taking the plunge. “Are you ready to make that call? It’s gonna be a lifetime,” he splutters, bluntly.</p>
<p>The band shed the brittle electronic flourishes of their previous album for Springsteen-inspired drive-time with big choruses, chugging guitar lines, and thumping drums giving them more widescreen scope than ever before. But Fink is no Bruce. His foppish voice suited their sweet early recordings, but there’s real strain in his singing as he attempts to compete with the fuller orchestration. Slight redemption comes with “Still After All These Years”, whose 1980s sitcom theme-worthy cheese marks a return to the band’s goofier days. But the contrived feel of the whole thing renders the album stiff; their search for large-scale anthems and keenness to replicate a formula that doesn’t come naturally to them leaves them sounding boxed in, and imbuing <i>Heart of Nowhere</i> with all the grace and flexibility of four concrete pillars.</p></div>"|18196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18196-noah-and-the-whale-heart-of-nowhere/|5.0|Dean Van Nguyen

For the last 25 years, Hellion has served as the head yawper and sole constant member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31337-integrity/"" target=""_blank"">Integrity</a>, an act that helped pioneer metalcore by stripmining punk rock’s firmament and flooding it with the influence of doom, thrash, and psychedelic rock. Their sound has been inestimably influential, helping to fork the path that bands such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"" target=""_blank"">Converge</a>, Hatebreed, and a million others have since traveled.</p>
<p>Musical import aside, though, Hellion’s often-discomfiting view of the world has fueled not only Integrity’s longevity but also, to an extent, listeners’ interest in the band. To follow Integrity is, in some sense, to wait for Hellion to say something generally disagreeable, to appreciate the screaming troll at the end of the microphone. To wit, Hellion is a fan of Charles Manson, having released his music on his own label, incorporated him prominently in the band’s art, and publicly called him <a href=""http://statementzine.blogspot.com/2009/12/dwid-hellion-integrity-psywarfare-irons.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an American folk hero.</a> Once asked to comment on the human condition, Hellion simply <a href=""http://statementzine.blogspot.com/2009/12/dwid-hellion-integrity-psywarfare-irons.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">replied</a>, “Humankind is a diseased animal.” And his mantra of sorts is “Love is the only weapon.” That might sound like a Bob Marley bumper sticker, but Hellion goes further, <a href=""http://www.noisecreep.com/2010/05/26/integrity-continue-endorsed-by-charles-manson/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">saying</a> that love is a great reset button for all those bodies “incarcerated within rotting flesh. Through love, we wish to destroy these confines.” Get the grunter a Hallmark contract.</p>
<p><i>Suicide</i> <i>Black Snake</i>, Integrity’s fitful new LP on excellent Baltimore imprint <a href=""http://www.a389records.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A389</a>, reaffirms both of Integrity’s key qualities-- that scathing attitude and cross-stitched aesthetic-- in 10 decidedly strange songs. Granted, the bulk of <i>Suicide Black Snake</i> might sound at first like clinical and belligerent hardcore. That’s mostly a symptom of Hellion’s voice, which has stiffened into a coarse bark as he’s aged, even since 2010’s more obviously warped <i>The Blackest Curse</i>.</p>
<p>But beneath the surface, these songs reveal complicated arrangements played entirely by multi-instrumentalist Robert Orr, essentially the one-man musical puppeteer behind Integrity. During “There Is a Sign”, for instance, a rudimentary blast of black metal drums pushes behind a slow riff that’s dense and distorted enough to fit within an Eyehategod album; Hellion, meanwhile, spews over the top of it all, his unapologetic hardcore growl giving the moment its surprising third dimension. The song soon accelerates into a punk rupture before pivoting, unexpectedly, into a spiraling guitar solo. “I Know Where Everyone Lives” opens with a classic rock, crying-guitar prelude that suggests Cream; in less than a minute, though, it’s pogoed into a ferocious circle pit, with Hellion roaring inside his self-made lane of commanding comfort. Orr returns to that 70s excess for closer “Lucifer Before the Day Doth Go”, a blacklight-on, lighters-out rock’n’roll anthem if only Hellion did more than scream over it.</p>
<p>By way of easy comparison, Hellion’s voice in Integrity makes the way that Damian Abraham leads <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"" target=""_blank"">Fucked Up</a> sound delicate and considered. Especially on <i>Suicide Black Snake</i>,<i> </i>Hellion overruns everything, his vocal opprobrium working as the oblivious bull laying waste to the proverbial china shop. Always an acquired taste, it’s occasionally a bit too<i> </i>much and too little here. Hellion can’t match Orr’s nimble approach on the failed hall of mirrors “Into the Night”; when the music disappears behind him at the end of “There Is a Sign”, his voice feels at once like a marvel and an unnecessary overcompensation, as though all these years of rotating band members have made him defensive of his dominant role in Integrity. At least he completely owns the more straightforward hardcore blasts such as “+Orrchida” and “Beasts as Gods”. Still, a quarter century into a project, shouldn’t mastery of the fundamentals be a foregone conclusion? </p>
<p>Perhaps it’s time for Hellion to give his customarily martial role a rest. After all, the most remarkable track here and the reason for returning again and again to <i>Suicide Black Snake</i> doesn’t even use it. “There Ain’t No Living in Life” is a doomy blues tune that suggests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"" target=""_blank"">Neurosis</a> playing <a href=""http://mountainjam.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mountain Jam</a>; Hellion speaks slow and low over <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"" target=""_blank"">Slint</a>-like guitars, adding harmonica just before the weight of the drums come crashing in. The darkness is still there-- “There is no light in this tunnel, and there is only one escape,” he intones. But it’s more visceral, relatable, and desperate, the sound of the blues given a shot of steel. This slow-burn is likely just an Integrity album anomaly-- because there’s generally at least one-- and not a new direction. Maybe it should be.</p></div>"|18100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18100-integrity-suicide-black-snake/|6.7|Grayson Currin

A year earlier, Spike Lee had followed his landmark <i>Do the Right Thing</i>, a film closely connected in spirit to the hip-hop street, with <i>Mo Better Blues</i>, a film whose main characters were sharply dressed jazz musicians trying to figure out how their work fit into the modern world. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14362-guru/"" target=""_blank"">Guru</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1678-gang-starr/"" target=""_blank"">Gang Starr</a> started a side project called Jazzmatazz, which found jazz legends playing alongside MCs; Us3 looped Herbie Hancock to create a global smash. Hip-hop jazz was now a thing, and one of the small, brilliantly burning sparks to emerge from this tiny explosion was the Brooklyn-based trio Digable Planets.</p>
<p class=""p1"">To understand the music of Digable Planets, it helps to remember the cultural landscape of the early 1990s. The crack epidemic was in full swing and violence was at an all-time high. (We’re rightly horrified at the 506 murders in Chicago last year, but in 1992, there were 943.) Coming off of 12 years of Republicans in the White House, Ronald Reagan and his successor, George H.W. Bush, had turned the country rightward, and each had scored political points by exploiting racial prejudice. The youthful energy of the civil rights generation was fading; young people who might have seen Martin Luther King, Jr. or Malcolm X speak in person were well into middle age. Hip-hop was well established and rapidly growing in popularity, but it wasn’t yet a global cultural force. </p>
<p class=""p1"">So what did “jazz” mean in this hip-hop moment? It went beyond just sampling grooves and instrumental accents from the Roy Ayers catalog or the groove-based hard bop of the 50s/60s Blue Note catalog (though there was a lot of that too). Part of it can be found in that Q-Tip lyric: <i>This is my music, and my father hears his music in it</i>. It was a way to connect a thread of African-American culture to the earlier generations, to affirm a sense of shared experience and tradition. “My father always told me jazz is the black person’s classical music,” Digable Planets MC Ishmael “Butterfly” Butler told writer Ann Powers in the <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=j-725tYrh9kC&amp;q=digable#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">May 1993 issue of <i>SPIN</i></a>. So jazz as an idea in hip-hop was a story of tradition and shared knowledge, of connecting a younger cohort to the radical art of their parents’ generation. And in the tense era of the 80s and 90s, there was comfort to be found in that continuum, of positioning this new music in the context of an earlier sound that had changed the world.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If Digable Planets were the product of a specific time, they also came together in a specific place. <i>Blowout Comb</i>, their second and final album, which was first released in 1994 and now returns in the form of this gorgeous and beautiful-sounding vinyl reissue from Light in the Attic, is practically a love letter to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Fort Greene. It’s a part of the borough with a long history (Walt Whitman lived here), and not all of it was rosy (in the 1970s and 80s, crime in the area was endemic). It’s also a neighborhood of African-American families, and it has been known as an incubator of creativity. Spike Lee’s <a href=""http://www.40acres.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">40 Acres and a Mule</a> office is based here; jazz musicians young (Branford Marsalis) and old (Cecil Taylor) called the area home. As described in <a href=""http://bkboheme.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Brooklyn Boheme</i></a>, a film by Fort Greene resident and writer Nelson George, during the late 1980s and 90s Fort Greene was a nexus of African-American cultural activity, to the extent that George calls it the late-century Brooklyn version of the Harlem Renaissance. It was a good place for Digable Planets, none of whom were native Brooklynites, to set up shop.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">The group’s debut album, 1993’s <i>Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space)</i>, is very good, but all the promise of the project was realized with its follow-up. <i>Blowout Comb</i> is an album of forces pulling in different directions, exerting tension and stretching into new forms. On a purely sonic level, the music, produced by the group, is beautiful and goes down so easily it’s almost disconcerting. The mixture of soul and jazz samples and live instrumentation paints an eminently listenable late-night atmosphere: there are clouds of vibraphone, drum loops firmly in the pocket, creaky Fender Rhodes lines, tasteful horn accents, all of it anchored by warm, snug, and instantly memorable basslines. The general sonic approach became more prominent as the 90s wore on, as these kinds of crate-digging, rare-groove types continued to mine old soul and jazz records for samples, eventually transforming into a kind of supper-club trip-hop (Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister, Thievery Corporation). But Digable made the approach feel completely organic and integrated with their broader musical goal of expanding rap’s reach and deepening its connection to music history. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Digable also found an approach to rapping that fit perfectly with their musical ideas. The three MCs-- Butterfly, Craig “Doodlebug” Irving, and Mary Ann “Ladybug Mecca” Vieira-- rap with confidence, skill, and force but they also sound relaxed, unhurried, close to the microphone, and intimate. “No stars, just bars,” Doodlebug raps on “The May 4th Movement”, and his words serve as a good explanation for what’s going on here. Because the vocalists take a similar angle on rapping, they feel like a true unit, individuals who are comfortable giving over a certain amount of their personality to the project as a whole. Ladybug often takes the first verse on a given track, and since the three MCs truly feel like equals and there’s not much in the way of macho posturing, lines between masculine and feminine also seem porous. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But if the sound and vocals are decidedly chill, the lyrics are alternately celebratory, searching, and anxious. There is a strong thread of black nationalist consciousness (Butler's father is a professor of African-American history) but it’s often presented impressionistically. “Black Ego” opens with a spoken exchange that finds Butterfly being arrested and shaking off a racial slur with a “here we go again,” and later finds him transcending the situation with a mix of affirmations and escapist Afro-futurist imagery (“My shit's, a natural high, the man can’t put no thing on me/ Now catch me when my mind stretch out, it's astro black/ Time reaching into end, nappy Afro-blue”). “Dog It” has references to out-jazz genius Eric Dolphy, Marvin Gaye, bell hooks, and raised fists; elsewhere we find Five-Percent National imagery and mythology (see Ladybug’s “68 inches above sea level/ 93 million miles above these devils” on “9th Wonder (Blackitolism)”. Mixed in with the political observations and mysticism are joyful observations of everyday life, of soaking in the texture of the streets and feeling happy to be young and motivated and creative. Anyone who has felt even the slightest romantic pull of bohemian living can recognize the youthful assuredness mixed with wide-eyed wonder that pervades the record.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">So <i>Blowout Comb</i> is a modest hip-hop classic that thrives on contrast. It’s both dated and timeless, angry and laid-back, smooth and prickly. It’s one of the easier albums in pop history to put on and enjoy and vibe out to, but it has a rich undercurrent of history and thought. It’s also something of a cul de sac. Though Butler did pick up some of these threads and combine them with more abrasive and abstract music as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28847-shabazz-palaces/"" target=""_blank"">Shabazz Palaces</a>, Digable Planets as a project did not endure. Culture moved on and rap moved on with it. But <i>Blowout Comb</i>, a richly rendered world with so much to explore, is still there and is accepting visitors, and it has a lot to teach us on whatever level we choose to listen. </p></div>"|18154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18154-digable-planets-blowout-comb/|9.2|Mark Richardson

Since guitarist, vocalist, and leader Matt Pike got sober, the Oakland trio's sounded especially alive and committed to the spirit of metal. People often use descriptors like “crushing mountains” and “moving planets” to describe High on Fire, and while they don't do that literally-- metal might be dangerous again if they had such powers-- their lust for volume will take care of any internal struggles. You come in to a High on Fire show complaining about your dead-end job, you come out thinking you can die peacefully.</p>
<p>Despite this, <i>Spitting Fire Live Vol. 1 and Vol. 2</i>, recorded at New York City's Bowery Ballroom and Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg during their most recent US tour, feels inessential like most live records released before or since KISS' <i>Alive!</i>. Concert albums never sound like the concerts they're supposed to capture, and with a band whose presence can stifle trite conversation like High on Fire's, it's a disservice. There are a number of technical details one could get into, but the point is simple enough: you're not there. You're not seeing Pike pluck strings like his life depended on it. His facial expressions when he's soloing-- missing out on that, too. You're not really getting the most low end you can from Jeff Matz. Des Kensel's bass drum isn't hitting your heart in the ways that it should. And you're not smelling the weed Pike can't smoke, or the beer he can't drink. It's just not the goddamn same.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the discs pull from material from across their career, which highlights the transition from Pike, “The Guy Who Used To Be In Sleep” to Pike, “For Whose Riffs We Tremble.” His association with Sleep garnered High on Fire the “stoner metal” tag early on, despite Pike showing more ambition than his dopethroned brethren. High on Fire is a Metal band as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9720-judas-priest/"" target=""_blank"">Judas Priest</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"" target=""_blank"">Black Sabbath</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden/"" target=""_blank"">Iron Maiden</a> are Metal bands-- nothing before Metal, nothing after. This tour was not just in support of their most recent studio album, 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16478-de-vermis-mysteriis/"" target=""_blank""><i>De Vermis Mysteriis</i></a>, but also the Southern Lord reissue of their debut <i>The Art of Self Defense</i>. High on Fire included “Last”, “10,000 Years”, and fan favorite “Blood From Zion” from <i>Defense</i> on the setlist, and their smoldering fires don't burn as bright or as hot as the infernos of their later material. “Zion” holds up the best, but it's no “Snakes for the Divine” or “Fury Whip.” Even if you only listen to both editions of <i>Spitting Fire</i> once-- and it's likely you will-- seeing how much High on Fire improved from album to album is of some merit.</p>
<p>The double live set might satisfy the curiosity of some who wonder what songs from the 2010 Greg Fidelman-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13966-snakes-for-the-divine/"" target=""_blank""><i>Snakes For the Divine</i></a> sound like “dirtied up.” While it's far from a Boston-slick Devin Townsend album, Fidelman's production on <i>Divine</i> is cleaner than the albums produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6367-steve-albini/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Albini</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3864-blessed-black-wings/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blessed Black Wings</i></a>, High on Fire's 2005 breakthrough), Jack Endino <i>(<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11021-death-is-this-communion/"" target=""_blank"">Death is this Communion</a></i>), and Kurt Ballou (<i>Vermis</i>). While <i>Divine</i> received plenty of praise, there was also a contingent who thought it represented a sterilization of Pike's inner animal. (If those folks have trouble with Pike standing on top of K2 busting out the intro to <i>Divine</i>'s title track, though, their imagination needs some greasing.)</p>
<p>But, all said, it's hard figuring out why <i>Spitting Fire Live</i> is being released in the first place. It's basically just another product clogging up record store shelves, and would work better as a (preferably free) download. Actually going out to a High on Fire will imbue memories of headbanging to the rhythm of Pike's beer gut. The end result of <i>Spitting Fire Live</i>? Probably nothing more than ripped CD files languishing in a terabyte external drive.</p></div>"|18211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18211-high-on-fire-spitting-fire-live-vol-1-2/|5.9|Andy O'Connor

Of his three main points of reference, the closest is Nick Cave, whom Harvey played with in their fledgling band Boys Next Door, then the Birthday Party, and on to the <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Bad Seeds</a>-- whose primal menace and eerie tenderness Harvey added to immeasurably. Harvey also spent years in Simon Bonney’s collective Crime and the City Solution; by the 90s he’d added a third coordinate, French pop legend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/"" target=""_blank"">Serge Gainsbourg</a>, the source of material for his first two solo albums, 1995’s <i>Intoxicated Man</i> and 1997’s <i>Pink Elephants</i>, the latter of which dared to offer a single Harvey composition. When Harvey left the Bad Seeds in 2009, it was as a superb multi-instrumentalist who had aided, abetted, or interpreted many great singer-songwriters, but who had contributed shockingly little to the world as a singer-songwriter himself.</p>
<p>Harvey’s 2011 solo album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15380-sketches-from-the-book-of-the-dead/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sketches From the Book of the Dead</i></a> was his first since leaving the Bad Seeds, and it was also his first disc of all original material. While solid, its jazz-folk melodrama suffered from sounding like the average of his three big touchstones. With <i>Sketches</i>’ follow-up, <i>Four (Acts of Love), </i>he’s returned to a more comfortable ratio of originals to covers. It’s a harmonious alchemy. None of the artists Harvey has chosen to cover is surprising; among them are Roy Orbison, Van Morrison, Exuma, the Saints (whom Harvey has covered before), and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a> (whom he’s covered, produced, and played with).</p>
<p><i>Four (Acts of Love) </i>oozes curdled lust, broken obsession, and morbid romanticism. It’s a self-described song cycle-- and it’s actually structured as a cycle rather than an arc, bookended by the tracks “Praise the Earth (Wheels of Amber and Gold)” and “Praise the Earth (An Ephemeral Play)”. The two click together to form a tarnished ring, one that describes the act of love as an epic boom-and-bust. Better yet, the songs shed the shadows of Harvey’s bosses and prior influences-- and own the fact that Harvey is no longer a mere sidekick, but rather a contemporary of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Gira</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Callahan</a> with just as singular and stentorian a voice, if less assured of its power. Through a fluttering filter of reverb and weaves of languid jangle, Harvey sings sweetly and huskily of oblivion, pining for the hereafter like it’s the girl that got away.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Glorious” is Harvey’s duet with PJ Harvey, although she wisely plays a supporting role as Mick drones on laconically about debilitating love; if she raised her voice any higher, it wouldn’t be a Mick track anymore. The most potent droning, though, is saved for the  Morrison cover, a take on the darkly jaunty <i>Astral Weeks</i> classic “The Way Young Lovers Do” that bobs along on an ambient ebb. That subtlety informs most of the album, only letting up on its semi-acoustic cover of the Saints’ “The Story of Love,” which taps into the song’s punk roots for its clunky second half. <i>Four (Acts of Love) </i>is made up mostly of such slivers and fragments, and that adds to its strength; Harvey is trying out new things, wrestling with universals, and grasping at a new way to tell stories through song-- for him, at least. And even if it’s stretched thin and unsatisfying in spots, <i>Four </i>is our most distinct glimpse of Harvey yet.</p></div>"|18170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18170-mick-harvey-four-acts-of-love/|6.8|Jason Heller

It was an appealing concept-- a fictional persona who's actually less badass or supernatural than the MC who came up with him. It was also memorably funny, gaining due props from rap nerds and sports superfans alike for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bartman_incident"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Bartman</a>-exonerating Cubs lament ""Don't Blame Steve"" and the simmering grudge of the Shaq dis track ""Shazam"". The lyrics were reference-heavy, but rendered in uncomplicated language, delivered through a barking rasp so percussive and hectoring every line seemed to demand four exclamation points. The <i>Kenny Dennis</i> EP transcended its comedy to work as pure music, even if that comedy was largely inseparable from what made it so damned fun.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the further you stretch a comedy character-- which Serengeti's done on four albums now (including this one), along with that EP-- the more chance there is that the joke will get stale. There's also the chance that the artist becomes so invested in the character that his backstory gets fleshed out until he's no longer entirely a comedic character. In taking the latter route, Serengeti's instilled Kenny Dennis with some additional pathos, some extended range in subject matter, and a background that turns out to be a little more human-- and sad-- than previous records entirely let on. There's a framing device that runs through the album on a series of skit-like monologues from Kenny's old friend ""Ders"" (""Workaholics""' Anders Holm), frequently undercut by interjections from Kenny that sound like snippets of flashbacks or memories, culminating in a disillusioned Los Angeles reunion for a special 50th birthday celebration. Turns out, the Zubaz-wearing Brian Dennehy fanboy works as something besides just a broad yet evocative caricature.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The depth creeps in through the margins, and if it seems like an odd fit when it emerges, it still adheres well to the character. A guy like Kenny seems like the type to ruminate on the sins of no-good dirtbags, and ""Punks"" has him quietly, almost introspectively fuming about targets ranging from local criminals he hears about on police scanners to wrestling heels he fumes at on TV. His home life's strained, not constantly, but enough to leave him ""stupid stressed""; ""Kenny and Jueles"" swings masterfully from his frustration at what seems to be his wife's distance from him to a reconciliation and a return to give-and-take commitment (albeit one based upon her pride at Kenny clowning Nitro on American Gladiators). And closer ""Flows"" sees Kenny in mentor mode, engaging with ""mi casa es su casa""-style community and tearing Rahm Emanuel a new one for letting inner-city Chicago schools crumble. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3201-odd-nosdam/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Nosdam</a>, who's built a long production career out of rusted melancholy that knocks, has put together a slate of beats that leans heavier on the dissonant and unsettled side of the equation, and it does a lot to emphasize the mood, with the best juxtaposition-- the ghostly strings and uptempo breaks of ""West of Western""-- giving a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Split"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>California Split</i></a> type of existential weight to Serengeti's chaos-in-Reno tour ramblings.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The <i>Kenny Dennis</i> LP isn't a huge bummer of a departure, though-- it's actually a good companion piece to the goofier, more lighthearted EP, right down to the cover art. Opening cut ""Bang Em"" is still as hooky and stoopid-clever as precedent demands, from its class of 93 table-pounding hook (""You like 'em, you bang 'em/ You like 'em, you bang 'em/ Sometimes you don't like/ But you still bang 'em"") to its choppy, stream-of-consciousness syntax that jumps from Miles Davis namedrops to the vision-improving properties of carrots in the span of a couple of bars. ""Directions"" starts off with a diatribe threatening to make a lost, inquisitive passer-by ""extreme-a-ly late for your appoint-a-ment,"" shifts into bragging about his Skokie-to-Evanston jogging regimen, and hypnotically degenerates into an extended, jumbled ""you go left/right/up/down"" navigation scheme that sounds like the Contra Code gone haywire. And even if the last story from Ders is a bummer, it wouldn't resonate as much without the story of how a seven-year-old Ders met a generous Kenny at Sharper Image on ""Lazer Tag"", or Kenny using his local-celeb bonafides to introduce Ders to none other than Bo Jackson's wife in ""GT Show '93"". <i>Kenny Dennis</i> is definitely a type, but he's a type that feels real enough to want to hang out with, even during his downer moments.</p></div>"|18117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18117-serengeti-kenny-dennis-lp/|7.8|Nate Patrin

Try harder,”</a> it's a comment they must field often. There's some <i>Bleach</i> here, some ""Lithium"" there, but in the spirit of trying harder, Roomrunner's true orbit revolves around their hometown of Baltimore and their fellow noise-punk bands. Charm City was nowhere near the genesis for their favorite 90s grunge and post-hardcore sounds like Seattle or Chicago. While Nirvana recorded <i>Bleach</i> for Sub Pop and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"" target=""_blank"">the Jesus Lizard</a> recorded the <i>Pure </i>EP for Touch &amp; Go, the most famous song to come out of Baltimore in 1989 was the cheeseball anthem and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04KQydlJ-qc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">""Centerfield""</a> knock-off, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o1xcQuXdII"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">“Why Not?”</a>, written for the suddenly and surprisingly good Baltimore Orioles, who finally had the chance to go all the way. Did they? Of course not. They too had to try harder.</p>
<p>Over last 20 years the city’s plucky DIY music community has grown in size and in spirit thanks in large part to national publicity gained by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5258-dan-deacon/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Deacon</a> and the Wham City Collective. Warehouse spaces like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_Building"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Copy Cat Building</a> became industrial salons for the city's moshing art-core noise out of which Roomrunner was born. More specifically, the band rose from the ashes of Baltimore punk mainstays <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5580-double-dagger"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Double Dagger</a>. DD drummer and now RR guitarist/singer Denny Bowen hooked up with all-star Baltimore engineer Dan Frome in 2011 for a self-titled cassette EP, and again in 2012 for four uncontrollable grunge jams on the<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16607-roomrunner-super-vague/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window""> <i>Super Vague</i></a> EP. Frome returns for<i> Ideal Cities</i> on Fan Death Records, and leads the band outside of the lived-in brambles of noise that defined their first two releases.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Ideal Cities</i> tightens all the screws on Roomrunner’s noise rock-- it’s their <i>Nevermind </i>if you really want to rib them. The outer frequencies are trimmed, leaving much more meat to chew on, and sharper focus is put Bowen’s sardonic vocals. “Wojtek” is the band’s furthest leap into pop territory to date. The guitars and drums work in unison to give the song some breath, but the feedback that leaks out sounds like they’re trying to choke the ever-loving life out of a Strokes song.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Beyond “Wojtek”, Roomrunner decline to offer a helping hand into their atonal, arrhythmic salvos. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15463-bait-car"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">“Bait Car”</a> bounces around in 7/4 in several obtuse key signatures. The tumbling power chords that support “Bowlth” seem random at best, with Bowen’s nasal voice forging melody lines that complement the dissonant mess beneath it. The bulk of <i>Ideal Cities</i> flies in the face of “hooks,” instead leaving Bowen’s voice behind fat stacks of distorted bass and guitar. It might be jazz with different instrumentation, it would be math rock if they cared a bit more, but Roomrunner follow a long line of proud Baltimore bands who have so long been overlooked in the mainstream. They wear their weird, local colors proud.</p>
<div class=""im"">
<p dir=""ltr"">The testosterone rage of Baltimore’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29803-dope-body/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window""> Dope Body</a> sneaks out at the end of the brutish <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15010-roomrunner-weird/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">“Weird”</a>, and the stripped-down melodicism of Baltimore’s Weekends show up at the close of “Snac Error”, a song named after cryptic error message one gets on AIM/ICQ. This local debt Roomrunner pays on <i>Ideal Cities</i> makes it a prickly and cagey listen, one that doesn’t fully reveal itself until after several go-arounds, especially if you're not that familiar with the city's sound. Even if you come in with your palate trained on post-hardcore and Local H’s guitar feedback tricks, the angular approach that makes the band so powerful live makes the recorded version bleed together.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At about 30 minutes in length, <i>Ideal Cities</i> never overstays its welcome. It absolutely scans as sharing an aesthetic with Nirvana or the Jesus Lizard: ripped-jeans and ratty t-shirts, cans of Natty Boh and Western Fries, as cynical as it is passionate. But on “Apse”, Bowen lays out the band’s own us vs. them stance: “They’ve got a question/ Make up an answer.” That nonchalance in the face of authority seemed like a product of gen X in the 90s, but for Roomrunner today, it’s just the Baltimore ethos: we’ll do it the way we want to do it. Why not?</p>

The documents of his early career are the works of a kid very much in love with hip-hop but frustratingly ill-equipped to translate his verve into compelling music. His songs didn’t feel lived in; their observations were as slight as their lyrics were clunky. Even so, Miller proved a hit on the underaged weekend warrior circuit, and despite a withering critical reception, his 2011 debut album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16113-blue-side-park/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blue Slide Park</i></a> became the first independent hip-hop album to top the Billboard charts in nearly twenty years.</p>
<p>Things got knotty for Mac just as quickly as he took off, though. Beset by detractors and disillusioned with his career path (and the ever-present “frat-rap” association), he turned to promethazine to cope during 2012’s rigorous Macadelic tour. Miller also ran into threats of litigation from hip-hop producer Lord Finesse, who says his production was used without permission on a popular mixtape cut, and Donald Trump, who came calling after a 2011 single named after him racked up millions of views on YouTube. Miller kicked the promethazine habit, settled with Finesse out of court (although Trump still taunts him), and then summarily ditched his native Pittsburgh for Los Angeles, where he’s been palling around with members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>’s Top Dawg Entertainment collective ever since. <i>Watching Movies with the Sound Off</i> is steeped in the pathos of Mac’s bad year and the musical influence, both direct and indirect, of his new rap friends. It’s the wide-eyed kid brother of <i>Blue Slide Park</i> home from college extolling the virtues of meditation and salvia.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Watching Movies with the Sound Off</i> reintroduces Mac Miller as a druggy philosopher on the mic and a left field talent behind the boards. Gone are the undercooked shaggy dog stories of <i>Blue Slide Park</i> and mixtapes like <i>Best Day Ever</i>. In their place we get a batch of songs that break the surface with snarling, self-deprecating wit (“I don’t act hard/ Still read Babar” from opener “The Star Room”) and musings on mortality (“Probably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes” on “Avian”) and drugs (“That fetanyl, it numbs me/ ...Turns you into a junkie” on “Someone Like You”). There’s still a lemon here and there (“I spit the shit that leave a diaper brown” on the otherwise promising lead single “S.D.S.” and “Gees”, with its chorus of “Suck my dick before I slap you with it”), but the Mac Miller of <i>Watching Movies</i>, who feels comfortable trading verses with rap nerd favorites like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28528-jay-electronica/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Electronica</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a>, largely succeeds in distancing himself from the guy peddling kiddie-pool deep rhymes about drinking 40s in front of the police just two years prior.</p>
<p>Miller’s Doom-esque witticisms are dispensed here over production that matches <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a>’s 2012 cloud rap gambit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17391-onifc/"" target=""_blank""><i>O.N.I.F.C.</i></a> for sheer druggy majesty. Miller handles a good portion of it himself, turning in loping circus music on “Avian” and eerie descending mellotron melodies on the absurdly titled “Suplexes Inside of Complexes and Duplexes”. “Aquarium” stir fries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"" target=""_blank"">tUnE-yArDs</a>' “Powa”, churning out a slow-building and hypnotic barn-burner replete with massive drums and tasteful strings. The rest of <i>Watching Movies</i>’ production is farmed out to blunted Cali hip-hop luminaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30578-the-alchemist/"" target=""_blank"">Alchemist</a> as well as emerging production talents like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> and Odd Future’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"" target=""_blank"">Earl Sweatshirt</a>. Lengthy passages of stately, ephemeral soundscapes give <i>Watching Movies</i> the feel of a quixotic vision quest with Miller playing the role of the wizened sherpa.</p>
<p>The hazy sprawl of <i>Watching Movies </i>also gives Mac a chance to dart outside the boundaries of hip-hop a little. He ditches rapping on a few cuts, exposing a singing voice in line with the Mark Everett school of coarse-throated, disembodied vocalisms on the oceanic Clams Casino assisted “Youforia” and Pharrell’s gossamer “Objects in the Mirror”. Both are lightweight love songs that make up for what they occasionally lack in lyrical profundity with an open armed earnestness. He one-ups both with “REMember”, a letter to a fallen friend full of heartsick what-if scenarios (“You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up/ So I could meet your son and talk you up”) and frank talk about the therapeutic power of crying. All three are instances of Miller imparting stories that dig deeper than the bedroom boasts and quests for weed that made up the bulk of his songwriting up to this point.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Watching Movies with the Sound Off</i> is a quantum leap in artistry, but it’s not without faults; the album’s about three songs too long, and a couple of the tracks in the back end just plain run together. Also, while all of the guest spots here are welcome deviations from Miller’s adroit Stones’ Throw homage, they routinely punctuate how much room he’s got left to grow as a writer. It’s highlighted most poignantly on “Suplexes Inside of Complexes and Duplexes”, where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28528-jay-electronica/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Electronica</a> shows up unannounced to kick a nonsensical verse, his first in years, and blows the whole album sky high just recounting the story of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, and also in the spoken word interlude after “Red Dot Music”, which features breakout battle rap star Loaded Lux lampooning “Easy Mac with the cheesy raps”, ruthlessly snarling “Who the fuck is Mac Miller?” <i>Watching Movies with the Sound Off</i> begins to broach the subject, but the question still stands.</p></div>"|18202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18202-mac-miller-watching-movies-with-the-sound-off/|7.0|Craig Jenkins

But in doing so, the Pistols also created a caricature, one that could be readily trotted out <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p25SdQEnhHI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">by sleazy TV talk-show hosts</a> for cheap shock value and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69sNt64cwXk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">easily aped by sketch-comedy troupes</a>. And for all the media outrage and label politicking that surrounded the release of <i>Never Mind the Bollocks</i>, it was ultimately a slickly produced, highly accessible set, its anti-establishment invectives latched onto shout-along hooks crafted by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Matlock"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the world’s most ridiculed Beatles fan</a>. Really, the Pistols were just a rock‘n’roll band fronted by a singer who happened to hate rock‘n’roll. And his next move was to show everyone just how much, by redefining punk not as a sound or costume, but as an idea, a liberation philosophy of pan-cultural musical cross-polination and strident non-conformism.</p>
<p>Formed in 1978, mere months after the Pistols’ infamous implosion in San Francisco, Public Image Ltd. were not so much post-punk as meta-punk. Though he’d detest the comparison, PiL initially served precisely the same function for Lydon as the Plastic Ono Band did for another famous John L., a vehicle through which he could exorcise and excoriate the albatross of his former band. Not only was the new group’s very moniker a pointed comment on Malcolm McLaren’s shrewd attempts to commoditize the Pistols as punk-rock puppets (and Lydon's former bandmates’ complicity in the gambit), their self-titled debut single scans as a particularly bitter break-up letter; spiked with barbs like “You never listened to a word that I said/ You only see me for the clothes that I wear,” “Public Image” is essentially a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Do_You_Sleep%3F_(John_Lennon_song)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“How Do You Sleep?”</a> you can dance to.</p>
<p>Musically speaking, “Public Image” presented a logical bridge between Lydon’s old and new ventures, retaining the punk-rock drive and agitated vocals, but with a greater sonic expanse highlighting Jah Wobble’s subterranean basslines and Keith Levene’s metallic (in the materiality sense) guitar grind, and hinting at the dub reggae and Krautrock influences that would inform the early PiL's sound. But the album on which it appears, <i>First Issue</i>, presents no convenient gateway, tucking the single onto Side 2 while greeting rubberneckers with “Theme”, a grueling nine-minute dirge-- on which Lydon repeatedly screams “I wish I could diiiieeee” with varying degrees of anguish-- that serves as a litmus test to instantly ward off Pistols fans looking for another excuse to pogo. </p>
<p>Sure, the Sex Pistols could be nasty, but the primordial Public Image was unrepentantly brutal-- punk stripped of its fashion and tabloid-baiting sensationalism and reduced to its noisy, nihilistic essence. Where the Pistols engaged in broad-stroke critiques of British institutions, <i>First Issue</i>’s strikes on the Catholic Church are more like close-range stabbings that gruesomely twist the blade; through the two-part spoken-word churn of “Religion” (a song reportedly rejected by the Pistols) and the relentlessly harrowing “Annalisa” (based on a true story of an exorcism gone horribly wrong), Lydon’s voice is transformed from a mere instrument of provocation to the pure embodiment of sheer terror. (Not surprisingly, Warner Bros. deemed <i>First Issue</i> too uncommercial to release in the U.S.; this Light in the Attic reissue marks the first time the album has been officially available stateside.) </p>
<p>A word-association game with Public Image Ltd. inevitably yields the phrase “death disco,” however, that sound (and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOU6_JKL9r0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the single that coined it</a>) wouldn’t fully flourish until 1980’s <i>Second Edition</i>; rather than proffer a bastardized take on dance music, <i>First Issue</i> works the other way, applying disco production principles-- by boosting Wobble’s bottom end and foregrounding Levene’s tin-foiled guitar refrains-- to its deconstructionist rock attack. But what’s most striking today is the in-the-room immediacy and towering presence of the sound-- Canadian-born drummer Jim Walker may have only stuck around for this one record, but his Bonham-scaled boom leaves behind a career’s worth of craters. While future PiL records would provide easily photocopied blueprints to post-punk progeny like the Rapture, LCD Soundsystem, and Liars, <i>First Issue</i>’s industrial-strength stompers anticipate the scabrous art-punk of the Jesus Lizard and Slint, while Levene’s guitar curlicues on “Public Image” are the stuff <i>Daydream Nation</i>s are made of. </p>
<p>Not all of F<i>irst Issue</i> casts such an imposing shadow-- after completing the album’s first side at Townhouse and Manor Studios, the band had blown its budget, and finished off the album’s closing trifecta in a more affordable, lo-fi studio that specialized in reggae tracks. But the downsized dimensions encouraged the band’s experimental tendencies. “Low Life” and “Attack” succesively follow the “Public Image” single’s tunefully dissonant template but gradually debase it into echo-drenched disorientation, and though the dub-disco doodle “Fodderstompf” essentially amounts to a one-note joke stretched to seven minutes, it’s a significant one, presenting both a test run for the grotty grooves mastered on <i>Second Edition</i>, while paving the way for everything from Ween’s early bong-sucking pranksterism to James Murphy’s self-reflexive irreverence.</p>
<p>Rather than lard up the tracklist with endless outtakes and alternate versions, the <i>First Issue</i> reissue offers but two bonus incentives: beserker, <i>Bonanza</i>-inspired B-side “The Cowboy Song” and, far more intriguingly, a complete unedited 56-minute BBC interview with Lydon (conducted before the album’s release) that is well worth the price of re-admission for those who've already worn out their original vinyl import.. While Lydon has since cultivated a media personality as the consummate crank who gleefully hangs up on journalists, here he seems less surly than cagey and defensive, still stinging from the Pistols’ break-up and the perpetual flogging that band received from the press. It initially results in some painful moments of silence between Lydon and the intensely meek interviewer, but to her credit, she gradually gets him to loosen up and sound off on everything from the Rolling Stones (“they rip off everybody else’s ideas”) and Siouxsie and the Banshees (“I find their record appalling”) to the superiority of dance music over rock‘n’roll, which he’d already declared dead 35 years prior. And just as the album it accompanies set the discordant tone for next three-plus decades of indie rock, the interview yields its own uncanny prophecies-- Lydon stops just short of outing late BBC host Jimmy Saville as a pedophile, an insinuation that wouldn’t go public until <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHdYutib74"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an ITV documentary</a> brought the sexual abuse claims to light last year.

On their last album, 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14518-hidden-lands/""><i>H</i></a><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14518-hidden-lands/"">idden Lands</a>, </i>the music refracted early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective"">Animal Collective</a> and late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2741-mercury-rev"">Mercury Rev</a> through a reverbed cloudbank and they generated lyrics by refracting the words of Richard M. Ketchum's <i>The Secret Life of the Forest</i> through a translation program. Their new LP is not only granted the title <i>Ceres &amp; Calypso in the Deep Time, </i>it’s also ""the story of Ceres, a seal-like beast, and Calypso, her human partner, as they travel through the Mesozoic Era."" Oh, and each of the band's three members plays a different character, with leader Ryan Hover as ""The Deep Time."" When they give a rare interview, Hover might <a href=""http://progressiveman.com/candy-claws-the-story-of-a-young-ceratopsian/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">say something like</a>, “We just say [we're] Dream Pop because I’m a dinosaur from the Cretaceous Period dreaming I’m a human in a band in 2013.” Trippy.</p>
<p>But they are an actual dream-pop band on <i>Ceres</i>, as the most notable additions Candy Claws have made since <i>Hidden Lands</i><i> </i>are definition and structure; while maintaining the same wondrous perspective and amorphous textures, these are more likely to be considered “songs” than soundscapes. And it turns out Candy Claws have a knack for pop construct, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15510-candy-claws-transitional-bird-clever-girl/"">“Transitional Bird (Clever Girl)”</a> and “White Seal (Shell &amp; Shine)” boast swelling, immediate psych rock hooks that bloom from their earthy verses, countering the unwieldiness of their titles. It allows them a proper showcase for their unusual, intuitive melodic sense-- their chord progressions are deliberate and surefooted, but each turn tends to take a step or two beyond what’s expected. It’s either the result of super-advanced knowledge of music theory or none at all; considering Candy Claws made it a point to create <i>Hidden Lands </i>on instruments with which they had no formal training whatsoever, it must be the latter.</p>
<p>Whereas <i>Hidden Lands </i>defied definition and either drew you in from the beginning or not at all, Candy Claws’ disparate interests are allowed to exist as individual tracks here, creating numerous re-entry points and strange innovations: spaghetti western with a 90% chance of rain, the tropical psych adventures of Os Mutantes relocated to the bedroom of a landlocked teen. Often, <i>Ceres </i>sounds like the first legitimately happy shoegaze record. “Birth of the Flower (Seagreen)” is something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine"">My Bloody Valentine</a> performing “To Here Knows When” at an island resort.</p>
<p>Yet the same fanciful approach to the actual, physical recording of the music doesn’t do <i>Ceres </i>justice. It’s an immersive listening experience, but also a claustrophobic one. There’s flow, though a curious lack of dynamics as so much of it is taken up by midrange. The layers upon layers of whispering vocals and airy synths turns <i>Ceres</i> into a surprisingly loud and brittle listen, a brickwall covered in gauze. Perhaps it’s wishful thinking to imagine Dave Fridmann or Ben H. Allen taking a flier on these guys and rounding out the low end, after helping<i> </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips"">Flaming Lips</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt"">MGMT</a>,<i> </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29667-youth-lagoon"">Youth Lagoon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out"">Washed Out</a> fuse nature-boy naivety with studio nerd fervor into something festival-ready. But on the other hand, <i>Ceres </i>could’ve just easily benefited from a more holistic production along the lines of Animal Collective ca. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/191-sung-tongs"">Sung Tongs</a>, </i>stripping away the reverb and countermelodies to let things breathe.</p>
<p><i>Ceres &amp; Calypso </i>is certainly one of 2013’s more unique records, which is even more impressive considering how many of its precedents and peers are some of indie rock’s more populist acts. It’s a strange situation where you wish they treated their passions more like a career-- the leap in songwriting promises an advance, but the decision to record it in the same way as the billowing, freeform <i>Hidden Lands </i>makes it feel like a missed opportunity. It all leads to <i>Ceres &amp; Calypso </i>feeling like concrete evidence of their hippie cred, chock full of fantastic ideas and lacking just enough follow through.</p></div>"|18204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18204-candy-claws-ceres-calypso-in-the-deep-time-forever/|7.6|Ian Cohen

But Christelle Gualdi is by no means a slavish follower of trends: The French producer was self-releasing CD-Rs of kosmische-inspired, new age-y synth improv for some time before interest in the style began to grow in the late 2000s. By then she had found kindred spirits in the U.S. underground, including the likes of Oneohtrix Point Never and James Ferraro. Her engagement with that scene culminated in a very fine album for Olde English Spelling Bee as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28910-stellar-om-source/"" target=""_blank"">Stellar Om Source</a>, 2010’s <i>Trilogy Select</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Gualdi’s incorporation of dance forms into her music came after her deportation from the U.S., and a subsequent period of musical isolation in Belgium, where she is now based. The first recorded evidence of this shift was 2011 single ""Clarity"", followed by last year’s <i>Image Over Image</i> EP for Rush Hour imprint No Label. Gualdi’s new sound retained the shimmering, highly synthetic chord work of her previous output, but re-housed it in a crisp rhythmic chassis-- one which owed a clear debt to Detroit techno and electro pioneers like Underground Resistance and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1149-drexciya/"" target=""_blank"">Drexciya</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Joy One Mile</i> is the most comprehensive document yet of Gualdi’s new sound, and her most substantial release in some years. Each of these hardware-based compositions was road-tested live before being refined and recorded in a handful of takes. Fittingly, then-- and in contrast to the solipsistic repose of her earlier records-- their complex percussive patterns and glistening synth motifs fizz with barely restrained kinetic energy. The album was mixed by cult German house figure Kassem Mosse, who reportedly brought “clarity” to Gualdi’s original compositions. (Mosse’s impressionistic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15500-stellar-om-source-elite-excel-kassem-mosse-remix/"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of ""Elite Excel"" is also included here; while excellent, it feels a little extraneous given the extreme stylistic coherence across the rest of the record.) But these tracks are still remarkably dense, eschewing the linearity of much techno in favour of dizzying, polyvalent structures that seem to hint at several narrative arcs at once.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Take opener ""Polarity"". In its first two minutes, murky bass stabs and a higher counterpart seem to be implying two different root notes, before a third tone falls semitonally between the two. The result is deeply ambiguous, as if we could lurch in any direction at any time-- an effect aided by Gualdi’s restless stop-start structuring. After two minutes, though, rich, creamy pads enter and bundle the whole thing into shape. That trick-- of finding or maintaining coherence in the most seemingly adverse of circumstances-- is often the fascinating strength of these compositions. ""Trackers"" is bound together by a single dextrous synth sequence, pirouetting ceaselessly through a whirlwind of texturing before giving way to 303 acrobatics at the close. ""The Range"", with its brash kicks and claps, is perhaps the only moment when the sheer density of the mix becomes fatiguing-- though all is forgiven when those strange, tart chords descend from on high in the closing 30 seconds.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is techno, certainly, but the only suggestion of classicist homage comes in ""Par Amour"", where Gualdi deploys Lovie’s ""Motions of Love"" a capella more or less in its entirety. Rather than softening her alien atmosphere in deference to its earthly guest, though, Gualdi’s scintillating synth figures and de-centred rhythms remain as rich and strange as ever. In <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/12515-stellar-om-source-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> the producer has put vintage Detroit techno’s appeal down to it being “very genuine, very heartfelt, with such strong beliefs.” Her real achievement here-- just as with her new age-inspired recordings of a few years ago-- is that she doesn’t ironize or fetishize this now-lost utopianism, but embraces it fully, all the better to turn it to her own captivating ends.</p></div>"|18213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18213-stellar-om-source-joy-one-mile/|7.9|Angus Finlayson

The latter is the primary reason why the Def Jam-signed MC’s debut official album has yet to drop, despite its endorsement from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>, who recruited Morales for his Maybach Music Group years ago.</p>
<p>As much as he likes to present himself as a recklessly id-driven madman, and as entertaining as that aspect of his personality may be, it tends to stop at the door to the vocal booth. Those who know Morales only as a person balls-out crazy enough to snort coke in front of a Colombian policeman might expect his recordings to land somewhere between Waka Flocka and ODB, full of manic, scream-along club rippers. They might be disappointed to find out that his mixtapes in general, and this most recent one in particular, are emotionally complex, and more likely to find him grappling with the effects of his wild lifestyle than celebrating it.</p>
<p>Morales’s lawyers successfully got his house arrest lifted back in January, and the following month the case was dismissed despite the fact that there was surveillance video of him and his partner committing the crime. (His accountant refused to cooperate with prosecutors.) The aptly-named <i>Acquitted</i> is very much part of the tradition of the post-trial rap record, but unlike the form’s best-known examples (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z</a>’s <i>The Blueprint</i>, for instance) it’s short on unalloyed triumph.</p>
<p>After a brief intro, consisting of audio from a local news report on Morales’s acquittal laid over an operatic string arrangement, <i>Acquitted</i> begins in earnest with “Salute Me”. Lyrically it’s just like you’d expect the opening track on a mixtape from a rapper fresh off of house arrest and dropped felony charges to sound like: wildly boastful, with the strong suggestion that the ability to elude a conviction is only part of his street prowess. But the music itself is far from celebratory, and much closer to funereal, with bleakly minimal verses from Gunplay and elegiac choruses delivered by Peryon J. Kee in a melodic, Nate Dogg-ish flow that’s downright mournful. If Morales is happy to be back on the streets he certainly doesn’t sound like it.</p>
<p>Other tracks serve up that conflicted sensation in subtler ways. “D.O.P.E.” has an uptempo beat with stuttering snares that add a Latin flair to the trap formula, but while the lyrics comprise a list of Morales’s dope-pushing credentials there’s something strangely resigned about his perspective, and the line “Dope gon’ get me way more money than this fucking song” inverts the usual corner-boy-to-superstar storyline into something sad and inescapable. And there’s something relentlessly self-destructive about a rapper fresh off a court case boasting about “pulling drive-by shootings with some mobbed-up hoodlums,” the way he does on the malevolently gleeful ode to gun violence “Drop Da Tint”, as if he was just begging prosecutors to open another case on him, which they probably would have anyhow.</p>
<p>Morales isn’t all internal struggles and felony crimes, though. Two of the brightest spots on <i>Acquitted</i> come when he lets his more uncomplicatedly manic side take the wheel. “Been Did It” is all noisy rave synths and quarter-note handclaps that highlights Southern rap’s transition from MDMA obsession to a straight-up infatuation with EDM. And the chorus to “Cocaina (Que Linda)”, which consists of the title (in English, “Cocaine (How Beautiful)”) delivered in a beyond-catchy way, could easily become the most out-of-control club chant-along of the year.</p>
<p>Despite many of these songs’ addictive qualities, Morales and his team are promoting <i>Acquitted</i>’s final cut, “Bible on tha Dash”, as its lead single, and it’s easy to understand why. It’s the most appealing fusion of his psyche’s various facets, strangely uplifting even with a vein of self-doubt running through it, and with a little polish it could easily fit in on the Hot 100. It also suggests how interesting it would be to see Gunplay as a pop artist, but that will almost certainly involve him finally getting his official debut out, something that his behavior and self-portraiture makes out to be far from a sure thing. Let’s hope he doesn’t succeed in fucking it all up before then.</p></div>"|18234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18234-gunplay-acquitted/|6.9|Miles Raymer

By the time you’ve reached the record's end, you’ll have seen him try on a number of familiar hats. He repurposes <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"" target=""_blank"">OutKast</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRJSztf0bxw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Da Art of Storytellin Pt. 1”</a> (“Land of the Snakes”) and fashions it into an anti-L.A. tirade. He duets with the remaining members of TLC (“Crooked Smile”) on a song that can be read either as a breezy style mash-up or as sacrilege. He co-opts a snippet of a Mike Epps comedy routine and he flips <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28665-cults/"" target=""_blank"">Cults</a>’ “Bad Things” on a song about cheating, a track that also doubles down with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a>’ Amber Coffman showing up to coo on the (long, guitar-heavy) outro. “Forbidden Fruit” finds Cole swimming in A Tribe Called Quest's “Electric Relaxation”, a track that also features a barely audible Kendrick Lamar. And toward the end, there’s a song-length love letter to Nas-- “Used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall/ My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Who is the person at the center of all this outward projection? We still don't really know. Cole's second, attention-grabbing mixtape, 2009's <i>The Warm Up, </i>positioned him as an upstart unmoored from traditional conventions, an artist who could switch up flows, rap furiously and build his own hooks; <i>Born Sinner </i>finds himself standing in about the same place he was on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15879-j-cole-cole-world-the-sideline-story/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cole World: The Sideline Story</i></a>, but the green room here is a little nicer. Listening to <i>Born Sinner</i>, you can't help but think of the gold standards of the modern era, among them <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>'s first two albums as well as <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s 2012 opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/"" target=""_blank"">good kid, m.A.A.d. City</a> </i>(""Let Nas Down"" can certainly be viewed as Cole's answer to West's ""Big Brother"", which Cole references on the hook). Part of the reason you can't help but think of them is because Cole keeps bringing them up-- when you constantly point to the work of others, comparisons with them are inevitable. But while the production (mostly by Cole himself) favors the soulful, laid-back vibe of <i>College Dropout </i>and the string swoops of <i>Late Registration</i>, there's very little to make it distinct, something more than a nod to the past. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Once in a while he can create something catchy-- the <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/admin/albumreviews/albumreview/17588/pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a>-featuring ""Power Trip"" almost seems like it was designed in a lab for radio rotation but the album as a whole splices together musical eras and reference without much purpose. Which is too bad, because some sonic innovation might direct folks away from some of <i>Born Sinner</i>'s more grievous lyrical howlers: “My verbal AK slay faggots/ And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot, okay faggot?” Later, a starry eyed Cole gets philosophical: ""Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up/ Only bad thing about a star is they burn up."" He finds something that rhymes with Kanye-- Wanyá, as in Boyz II Men's Wanyá Morris-- and races to build a line about growing up, a boy to a man, you see. On ""Miss America"": ""I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag."" It goes on like this.</p>
<p>At its best, <i>Born Sinner</i>, showcases J. Cole's overall musicality, pairing his ability as a lyricist with a more broadly developed production palette. In a heat, he can rattle off some fierce rejoinders (See: ""Niggaz Know""). But several releases deep into Cole's growing catalogue, we haven't been delivered the savior that Jay-Z's ""A Star is Born"" seemed to anoint. (The latter's current indifference to Cole has become so pronounced that Cole <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/j-coles-new-album-im-all-the-way-inspired-20130502"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has to keep squashing beef rumors</a>.)

""Walking on a Dream"", their big hit, was so beguiling that Jay-Z flew them in from Perth to record for <i>The Blueprint 3</i>-- the most unlikely, out-of-context guest spot on a Jay-Z album since Lenny Kravitz on <i>The Blueprint 2</i>. Empire's <i>Walking on a Dream</i> was pop made by people fully intending to be famous, but part of its appeal was how endearingly homemade it felt. The big anthems were set off by odd grace notes like the ambient Eno-like ""The World"", the dark ""Swordfish Hotkiss Night"", or the George Michael/Prince mindmeld ""Breakdown"". EOTS were theatrical weirdos, for sure, but it seemed conceivable you might be able to walk up to them at a party and ask them, ""What's with the hat?"".</p>
<p>Their first album did its job, and now they are legitimately famous: They've have been touring internationally more or less nonstop since its release. (Party music that translates to outdoor festival audiences worldwide is a demanding beast.) <i>Ice On The Dune</i>, their five-years-in-the-making follow up, was written and recorded while running this endless arena-date treadmill, and you can instantly hear that music's homemade quirks have burned off like cellulite. With their baby fat gone, Empire of the Sun are both more impressive and less distinctive; they've made the confusing half-leap from indie-gone-mainstream (Luke Steele, Empire of the Sun's lead singer, started out in the indie-rock band Sleepy Jackson) to not-quite pop stars, and <i>Ice On the Dune</i> feels middling as a result.</p>
<p>It is certainly bigger, and more purposefully stadium-scaled, than its predecessor, from the hilariously portentous Danny Elfman flourish of orchestral opener ""Lux"" onward.  The best of the Big Moments are exhilarating: ""Alive"", always a good song title and pop-song sentiment, arcs up into a shouted chorus that jabs you in the chest with every repeated ""alive!"" You <i>will</i> dance to this, especially when its surrounded by the synths' popping carnival lights and spun sugar. ""Awakening"" pairs a humid Donna Summer thump with a creamy falsetto vocal straight from Toto. The midtempo ""I'll Be Around"" is probably the highlight, and underlines how deftly Empire flit between eras: The same materials reworked slightly would also make an excellent Pains of Being Pure At Heart song.</p>
<p>There are half-hearted fillips of weirdness here and there still: On ""Surround Sound"", Steele sings ""Let's push through four dimensions/ Till our brains turn to jelly,"" which feels more indebted to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzIHkFJnLbc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ween</a> than the Bee Gees. But the mind wanders during the album's middle third, subbing in other, more effective party music in the same vein to keep it occupied. The same year that Daft Punk released <i>Random Access Memories</i>, an album that brilliantly evoked the exuberantly ripe languor of late 70s/early 80s pop, is not an ideal moment for the return of EOTS. The comparison might seem unfair-- Daft Punk had a kingly, late-70s budget to burn through-- but these are EOTS's competitors now, and their voice isn't strong enough, their imprint on their diaphanous grooves not unique enough, to make them stick. Their stuff floats off, and the synths carry the whiff not of a beach breeze but of a department-store escalator.</p></div>"|18124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18124-empire-of-the-sun-ice-on-the-dune/|5.6|Jayson Greene

And <a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MSXAjFEBpmM/UJh22zgnZ6I/AAAAAAAAD1I/uQk5fGRUuzs/s1600/inspiral+carpets+tour.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>the sweaters</i></a>. Point being that while the clash of ecstasy, acid house, and rock'n'roll resulted in a brief period of brilliant, forward-thinking music, the leading lights of the scene were never all that bright. That hindsight puts an interesting perspective on Australian duo Jagwar Ma’s gleeful debut <i>Howlin’</i>; their early singles cast them as the purest Madchester revivalists in some time and the full-length delivers on that promise. The music is a heady swirl of baggy beats and unabashed Beach Boys melodies, while the lyrics are wholly uninterested in anything intellectual. It’s silly enough to cause skepticism and charming enough to make you wonder what kind of scrutiny <i>Screamadelica </i>or <i>Thrills, Pills &amp; Bellyaches </i>would meet if they were released in 2013.</p>
<p>The album gets its title from a line on the shambling “Uncertainty”: “When you’re gloomy/ Howlin’ looks so good to me.” The characters within <i>Howlin’ </i>are gloomy, they’re certainly not depressed; nothing that a little howlin’ couldn’t fix. They howl because they’re confused by loneliness, and unlike fellow Australian psych pop space cadets <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/"" target=""_blank"">Tame Impala</a>, solitude isn’t bliss; it can be externalized and rendered as a goofy Austin Powers-pop trifle on “That Loneliness”. They howl because it’s women, not drugs, that offer transcendence and Jagwar Ma needs the hook up; fluid breakbeats and classic psychedelic effects (backwards guitar, naturally) drive “Man I Need” and “Come Save Me”, tart and hooky songs too bashful to be overbearing. This is festival stuff, the movements coming off a bit drunk and a little wearied by the sun. The beat-driven tracks, “What Love” and “Four”, aren’t actually dance music, per se-- they lack the precision and rigor of proper electronic music. When Gabriel Winterfield yells “exercise your chemistry!” it's meaningless, but at least lets you know this isn’t rocket science.</p>
<p>In that sense, Jagwar Ma’s guilelessness works in their favor; they’re hardly the first guys who’ve banged the drums on Madchester's behalf, but they avoid the shamanistic mock profundity that resulted in a similarly positioned band named the Music making a song called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeNssuIDViw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The People”</a>. Ewan Pearson’s mixing is sweet, slick, and colorful as Skittles shells, meaning Jagwar Ma avoid the leathery cock-rocking that marred the Big Pink; the latter boasted “these girls fall like dominos,” whereas when Winterfield yelps “let me show me you babe just all the man I can be!” he sounds ready to pull a bouquet of flowers from behind his back. Only on the last two tracks do Jagwar Ma aspire to “serious” artistic ambitions, and the result is a preview of <i>Howlin’s </i>“darker,” “introspective” and duller sequel. Let's hope it doesn't come to that.</p>
<p>It’s possible to be incredibly ambitious and disarming at the same time, and in that way, <i>Howlin’ </i>isn't that different in approach to <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/"" target=""_blank"">Random Access Memories</a>-- </i>a backwards looking record about loving the present moment, a big-tent affair that can be misunderstood as a reactionary record. (It's no less reactionary than Noel Gallagher claiming <i>Howlin' </i>to be <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/jagwar-ma/69968"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more important than an Oasis reunion</a>.) From the moment “What Love” fades in with its loose-limbed, floppy rhythm, <i>Howlin’ </i>ensures everybody will be dancing, few will be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15456-daft-punk-doin-it-right-ft-panda-bear"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">doin' it right</a>, but they'll all be feelin’ alright regardless.<i></i></p></div>"|18225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18225-jagwar-ma-howlin/|7.7|Ian Cohen

The song sounds like it might just overheat and explode, but the Generals manage to keep a lid on everything. Barely.</div>
<div>
<p> It’s the Denton, Texas-based outfit’s first album in a full decade, which suggests a get-to-it-when-I-get-to-it attitude toward the creative process and a dismissive attitude toward the music business. In fact, they trashed at least one attempt at a follow-up, and the album they finally thought well enough of to release is so different from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11661-no-silverno-gold/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window""><i>No Silver / No Gold</i> </a>that it might as well be a fresh debut. It’s all too easy to romanticize this sort of art-for-art’s-sake mentality, especially when it comes from deep in the heart of Texas. However, lacking both the demonstrative lo-fi sprawl of its predecessor and the hermetic perfectionism that often marks long-gestating albums, <i>Jackleg</i> really does sound like the Baptist Generals made it first and foremost for themselves.</p>
</div>
<p>If that means it’s occasionally self-indulgent, fine. They sound like they take no small pleasure in fashioning the pinwheel rhythms on “Dog That Bit You”, setting them against Chris Flemmons’ scratchy vocal melodies, and creating something distinctive and unusual. As a result, <i>Jackleg</i> succeeds even when its musical resourcefulness is undermined by Flemmons’ overwrought lyrics. His reliance on antiquated language and poetic phrasing suggests a self-consciously old weird America rather than inhabiting the new weird one. Exactly as ridiculous as its title, “Clitorpus Christi” is a story-song without much of a story: The narrator talks about hiring a prostitute and not taking showers, but never gets around to having a point. It might be less of a sore spot if <i>Jackleg Devotional</i> took up that point of view again or if the Baptist Generals could find a way to couch it in a larger narrative.</p>
<p>Fighting against the song’s inconsequentiality is the singer’s adenoidal rasp, which recalls that of fellow Dentonite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2234-will-johnson/"">Will Johnson</a>. Flemmons doesn’t quite have the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/715-centro-matic/"">Centro-Matic</a> frontman’s expressive range, but to his credit he gives himself over fully to his characters. Arguably his best moment on <i>Jackleg Devotional </i>comes toward the end of “Snow on the FM”, when Flemmons elects to sing a string of la la la’s against a steady acoustic guitar theme. By delivering sound instead of words, his voice becomes purely instrumental-- one cog in a fascinating contraption of sound.</p></div>"|18235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18235-the-baptist-generals-jackleg-devotional-to-the-heart/|6.3|Stephen M.

On one hand, the album plays up an extensive narrative about outer space and alien life, which is reinforced by the band's frequent use of synthesizers.  In ""Green Blood"", Sonny Smith professes his love for an alien android, and maybe the antenna in question is pointing us to a distant planet. But then there's ""afterworld."" When he made this album, Smith had death on his mind-- a close friend of his had been murdered. Then, Smith visited a psychic, who gave him a message from another recently deceased friend named Nancy. ""Through the psychic, Nancy told me not to get too comfortable with loneliness, as she had done, to go out and live,"" he <a href=""http://www.goldflakepaint.co.uk/interview-sonny-the-sunsets/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. ""This could be what many psychics say, I have no idea, and I don’t care really."" He began to think about ""the afterworld"" quite a bit, and on the album, he cuts straight to the point when he folds that encounter into one of his lyrics: ""I had a visit from a dead friend/ She told me not to wallow in this loneliness."" And where does space come into play? Well, that song is called ""Path of Orbit"".</p>
<p>As it turns out, the album's title is an umbrella that covers most things spiritual and cosmic-- all the reasons why we stare upward and wonder what's out there or what's next. Smith doesn't get hung up on the specifics-- he accepts every possibility. ""I believe in everything,"" he <a href=""http://www.goldflakepaint.co.uk/interview-sonny-the-sunsets/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. ""I always have. Ghosts, afterlife, reincarnation, ESP, telekinesis, clairvoyance, mystics, shamans, psychics, miracles, the force, aliens. I believe it all."" That all-encompassing belief system is the heart and soul of <i>Antenna to the Afterworld.</i> Smith's acceptance of the fantastical is implied in his nonchalant lyrical approach. (On ""Primitive"": ""I love the moon/ I don't know why."") Really, though the paranormal and supernatural make several appearances in the LP's 11 tracks, they're never the center of attention in Smith's songs about love and the banal. His inherent belief in palmistry, for example, makes it so the titular ""Palmreader"" plays second fiddle to Sonny's scab- and glue-covered hands.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Smith and the band have been genre-jumping shapeshifters. Smith's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17620-100-records-vol-3/""><i>100 Records</i></a> series had him going from reggae to R&amp;B to folk to garage. Last year, on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16753-longtime-companion/""><i>Longtime Companion</i></a>, Smith took the band country. This time, they've made something that's very much its own creature. When the synthesizers come in, they understatedly float over some soft, warm guitar pop. On ""Natural Acts"", the country influence has carried over in their guitars, though they're layered alongside synthesizers and the occasional acid-soaked psychedelic vocal stab. Later, on ""Void"", Smith and the gang have some garage rock fun. Smith whoops like an ape, claps his hands to match his vocals, and then a delighted Tahlia Harbour playfully sings along with the instrumental outro. Both musically and lyrically, the album presents some of the Sunsets' best work yet.</p>
<p>Though <i>Antenna </i>will probably be viewed as Sonny's ""space and synthesizers album,"" it's also full of doe-eyed and fragile moments. Over the jangling melody of ""Girl on the Street"", he pines over someone he's never spoken to, but who he stares at from a distance. In ""Mutilator"", he sings an awed love song about a sword swallower. (She's also the girl attached to the knife thrower's spinning wheel.) But as surreal ballads go, nothing beats ""Green Blood"". His android lover is shot by her scorned cyborg husband, but that isn't the end of the story. She lives, and they try to make it work. So the song gets the same kind of quietly sad ending from most breakup stories-- they just drift away. When Harbour asks if she went back to her cyborg husband, Sonny's reply is dejected and unsure. ""I don't even know. But I miss her, you know? I really miss her."" <i>Antenna to the Afterworld</i> may have all the dressings of science fiction and fantasy, but like many great works in those genres, it's a strong, emotive character study. He might've replaced the cowboy hat with a spaceman's helmet, but Sonny Smith still writes like a country balladeer.</p></div>"|18109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18109-sonny-the-sunsets-antenna-to-the-afterworld/|7.7|Evan Minsker

Following full-length collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16084-action-bronsonstatik-selektah-well-done/"">Statik Selektah</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16425-action-bronson-blue-chips/"">Party Supplies</a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16425-action-bronson-blue-chips/""> </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17375-rare-chandeliers/"">Alchemist</a>, <i>Saaab Stories </i>matches Bronson with Harry Fraud, a guy who can play both sides of the underground/Hot 97 divide with beats as rugged and plush as a sheepskin shearling. But at a time when Rick Ross’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50291-reebok-drops-rick-ross-due-to-rape-controversy"">verse on “U.O.E.N.O.”</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler, the Creator</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51072-tyler-the-creator-reported-to-australian-police-after-stage-tirade-against-feminist-group/"">anti-feminist rant in Australia</a> and certain lyrics on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus </i></a>have resulted in real backlash throughout a wide swath of hip-hop and an opportunity to ask tough questions about the genre's pervasive attitudes towards women, Bronson chooses <i>that </i>artwork. Repellant as it is, it’s also not the least bit surprising: If you’ve heard more than five minutes of Action Bronson’s music, you'll be aware of his attitude towards women, and Asian prostitutes in particular. So while his prodigious talents as a rapper ensure you might enjoy <i>Saaab Stories </i>on a purely musical level, it’s unlikely you’ll feel better when it’s over. </p>
<p>While <i>Saaab </i>stories is Bronson’s shortest official release, it’s his most diverse and sonically interesting. Fraud finds middle ground between the weeded-out YouTube scour of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16425-action-bronson-blue-chips/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blue Chips </i></a>and the more traditional crate-digging on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17375-rare-chandeliers/"" target=""_blank"">Rare Chandeliers</a></i>-- classic boom-bap on “Strictly 4 My Jeeps” and “No Time”, regal cloud-rap on “The Rockers”, simmered soul on “Triple Backflip”. Attending to the realities of Bronson’s ascendant career brings <i>Saaab </i>to a dead halt; “feat. Wiz Khalifa” is a passport stamp for an up-and-comer and an invitation for the listener to hit fast forward (“The Rockers”). Meanwhile, Prodigy is every bit as incapable of delivering a coherent rap these days, though it’s not for lack of trying.</p>
<p>The title of <i>Saaab Stories </i>is actually misleading for both parts of its double entendre.<i> </i>On prior highlights such as “Hookers at the Point” or “Bag of Money”, Bronson <i>was </i>a storyteller, whereas <i>Saaab </i>has a loose, performative aspect more along the lines of raunchy comedy; you can picture him leaned against a stool at a stand-up gig, or bragging over a brown bag lunch. If his appetites are base, his words make those dirtbag pursuits sound opulent as hell (“Amethyst on the knuckle/ On the arm, something Spanish with a bubble”). There’s an anti-clever cleverness to similes like “gold watch like I just retired” that hearken back to prime-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27670-doom/"" target=""_blank"">DOOM</a> in terms of finding the most obvious likenesses that somehow never got used.</p>
<p>But the sheer percentage of lyrics purposefully written to degrade women is about the only thing that might leave a lasting impression. The narrowing of Bronson’s subject matter has resulted in an increasingly less satisfying artistic experience. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15497-dr-lecter""><i>Dr. Lecter </i></a>and <i>Blue Chips</i> weren’t<i> </i>particularly relatable records<i>, </i>but even the smallest amount of emotional and personal scope worked towards distinguishing Bronson from his vocal doppelgänger <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface</a>, creating a tangible persona that couldn’t be culled from the jaw-dropping lines about gourmet food and old school sneakers.</p>
<p>Gone is any counterbalance of self-deprecation (like <i>Dr. Lecter’s </i>fat-kid reminiscence “Ronnie Coleman”) or narrative to put the constant putdowns in context (“Thug Love Story 2012”); a line like “If I’m sick she’ll even clean me if I shit in my pants/ So I’m taking her to France with me” from “No Time” qualifies as chivalrous by comparison. And while getting two punchlines out of “Mutombo finger” in the same verse is pretty funny, the repurposing of old lyrics for the hooks on “Triple Bakckflip” and “The Rockers” gives the sense that Bronson might be running out of ideas.<i></i></p>
<p>Which makes his means of filling the void even sadder; more than ever, Bronson takes particular pleasure in biting down on a harshly pronounced <i>bitch </i>ad-lib or using a hook to reduce a woman to the sum of her orifices. You can generously read some of the actions of Tyler, the Creator or Kanye’s lyrics on <i>Yeezus </i>as purposeful trolling, or at least an incredibly awkward means of trying to start a conversation. Yet, Action Bronson only seeks to provoke indignation at Action Bronson, as if he harnesses the strength of conviction from vindicating those who find his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46626-action-bronson-stupidly-posts-photo-of-drunk-mexican-tranny-rightly-gets-in-trouble/"">off-record persona</a> every bit as abhorrent. It was barely a year ago when Bronson was predicating his career on something other than being as unlikeable as possible, so there’s hope he isn’t too far gone. But on the grim, vulgar <i>Saaab Stories</i>, what you see is what you get.</p></div>"|18186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18186-action-bronson-saaab-stories/|6.1|Ian Cohen

The first is of his brief career with the melancholy orchestral-pop group the Walker Brothers, who for a couple of years in the mid-1960s were famous enough to be a front-cover concern on <i>Tiger Beat</i> magazine and have their car overturned by fans while they were still sitting in it. Walker quickly became uncomfortable with this, and in 1967 went solo with four theatrical and increasingly dark albums, all called <i>Scott</i>. ""GOING SOLO IN A MONASTERY!"" a headline in <a href=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0vwntTBEN1qbjiaso1_500.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Melody Maker</i></a> read-- a monastery Walker had to leave because fans started banging on the door looking for him.</p>
<p>The <i>Scott </i>albums-- now remastered and collected into a box set with 1970's <i>'Til The Band Comes In</i>-- are the fulcrum of Walker's career: You can hear where he'd been, and in retrospect, where he was going; his third act was emerging after 20 years of almost total silence with <i>Tilt</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8764-the-drift/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Drift</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17387-bish-bosch/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bish Bosch</i></a>,<i> </i>released between 1997 and 2012. Walker's latter-day albums are fearless and violent, featuring wailing donkeys, moans, scrapes, and famously, the sound of someone punching meat. They seem to have been written in another language entirely.</p>
<p>The <i>Scott</i> albums, however, remain part of a tradition of highly arranged, rock-free music that valued old songs over new sounds and professionalism over innovation. ""I don't wanna see my fans walking around like drugged zombies,"" Walker told a journalist around the time <i>Scott</i> came out in 1967, a rejection of the psychedelic culture prevalent at the time. Instead, he embraced conventionally gorgeous, string-heavy music targeted at housewives and elderly people. At the same time, he fell headlong into existentialist literature and European art-house cinema. He appeared on variety shows, and remained either at or near the top of the charts. He also developed a pitch-black sense of humor, and in his rich, mocking baritone explored songs about Soviet dictators and the spiritual poverty of men who only feel human in the company of whores. </p>
<p>""Jackie"", the single released in advance of <i>Scott 2</i>, was banned by the BBC. When the album came out, it went to Number 1. It remains the first recorded instance of the hyphenated adjective ""stupid-ass"" that I can think of. By 1969 Walker was writing epics about Ingmar Bergman movies featuring dissonant choir arrangements and trumpets blowing through canyons of reverb. Around this time he was also given his own television show, where he performed all your toe-tapping and heart-rending favorites in black sunglasses, without smiling. </p>
<p>This is the Scott Walker of the late 1960s: As passionately invested in covers of Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra hits as in singing the word ""gonorrhea""; voted ""Mr. Valentine"" by <i>Disc &amp; Music Echo</i> the same year he released a song about a young man routinely raped by military officers. His best performances convey the deep tragedy of their subjects while managing to laugh at them with a cruelty and indifference available to only the most total of douchebags.</p>
<p>The essential contrast in his late-60s albums is between easy-listening music and forbiddingly difficult subject matter. It's a dichotomy that has always made Walker seem more like an outsider artist than a mainstream one. It's also fodder for a case that Walker was ""subversive,"" an accolade for alternative-music fans who, especially now, can recast him as some kind of mole inside the machine, exposing the innocent people of Britain to material that would make their middle-class spines shiver. This isn't untrue. But it also smoothes over the fact that the <i>Scott</i> albums are different pieces of music that leave different impressions. Any attempt to lump them together is more a matter of laziness or historical convenience than anything else. If you look at the credits from <i>Scott</i> onward, what you see, essentially, is Walker taking over the show: on <i>Scott</i>, he wrote three songs among its 12, the rest covers; by <i>Scott 4</i>, he wrote them all. </p>
<p>Walker's choice of covers essentially falls into two camps: Easygoing heartbreak music and songs by the Belgian writer Jacques Brel. The latter's impact on Walker can't be understated: Walker covered him nine times on his first three albums, and some of the most elegant expressions of Walker's romantic but poisoned worldview are his. Take ""The Girls and the Dogs"", from <i>Scott 2</i>, a psychopathically chipper song about how men are longing, women are fickle, and dogs are lucky to not care either way. ""The dogs, well you know the dogs, they lift up a leg as they see it end/ The dogs, well you know the dogs, and maybe that's why they're man's best friend,"" goes the refrain. ""And yet,"" Walker sings toward the end, ""it's because of the girls, when they've knocked us about and our tears want to shout/ That we kick the dogs out."" Over the course of about 10 seconds, his voice hardens from drippy sympathy to resolute meanness, and as the song fades out, he defers to a choir of trombones that sound like they wandered out of a burlesque show. In essence: The world is a monochromatically cruel place, so ha ha ha, fuck it.</p>
<p>Walker's own songs are more ambiguous. From <i>Scott 2</i>, ""The Amorous Humphrey Plugg"" tells the story of a deflated husband who finds his peace of mind wandering thorugh the red-light district at night. ""Leave it all behind me,"" he sings, sailing away on a tide of violins. ""Screaming kids on my knee and the telly swallowing me/ And the neighbors shouting next door/ And the subway trembling the rollerskate floor."" Like good satire, Jacques Brel's songs cue you to laugh then startle you with reality. Walker puts you in the uncomfortable position of wondering whether to laugh in the first place, or to just lean back and allow these characters a glory that eludes them in their own lives.</p>
<p>Then there are songs like the simple, country-influenced ""Duchess"", from <i>Scott 4</i>. The same singer who rejected psychedelia started writing the kind of impressionistic lyrics whose nonsense is more penetrating than anything more literal could be. ""It's your shiftless flesh and your old-girl's grace,"" he sighs. ""It's your young girl's face that I'm breathing."" In both sound and lyric, Walker's music became more and more evocative, leaving behind the easy gratification of his earlier albums for broad, cinematic arrangements and stories that end not on punch lines, but question marks.</p>
<p>There are defenders of 1970's <i>'Til The Band Comes In.</i> I am not one of them, and for what it's worth, neither was Walker. Reportedly puzzled by the fact that his audience wasn't interested in dense songs about hookers and child abuse, he made the humble mistake of trying to will himself back to popularity. It has redeeming moments-- like the eulogistic ""Joe""-- but not many. Its worst songs are embarrassing: In an irony Walker could probably appreciate in time, he'd become one of the gloriously desperate people he'd sung about only a year or two earlier.</p>
<p>For anyone who hasn't heard Scott Walker before, the prospect of buying a five-album box set like <i>The Collection</i> is ridiculous. For fans that already own these albums, it's absurd.

The first is of his brief career with the melancholy orchestral-pop group the Walker Brothers, who for a couple of years in the mid-1960s were famous enough to be a front-cover concern on <i>Tiger Beat</i> magazine and have their car overturned by fans while they were still sitting in it. Walker quickly became uncomfortable with this, and in 1967 went solo with four theatrical and increasingly dark albums, all called <i>Scott</i>. ""GOING SOLO IN A MONASTERY!"" a headline in <a href=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0vwntTBEN1qbjiaso1_500.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Melody Maker</i></a> read-- a monastery Walker had to leave because fans started banging on the door looking for him.</p>
<p>The <i>Scott </i>albums-- now remastered and collected into a box set with 1970's <i>'Til The Band Comes In</i>-- are the fulcrum of Walker's career: You can hear where he'd been, and in retrospect, where he was going; his third act was emerging after 20 years of almost total silence with <i>Tilt</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8764-the-drift/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Drift</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17387-bish-bosch/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bish Bosch</i></a>,<i> </i>released between 1997 and 2012. Walker's latter-day albums are fearless and violent, featuring wailing donkeys, moans, scrapes, and famously, the sound of someone punching meat. They seem to have been written in another language entirely.</p>
<p>The <i>Scott</i> albums, however, remain part of a tradition of highly arranged, rock-free music that valued old songs over new sounds and professionalism over innovation. ""I don't wanna see my fans walking around like drugged zombies,"" Walker told a journalist around the time <i>Scott</i> came out in 1967, a rejection of the psychedelic culture prevalent at the time. Instead, he embraced conventionally gorgeous, string-heavy music targeted at housewives and elderly people. At the same time, he fell headlong into existentialist literature and European art-house cinema. He appeared on variety shows, and remained either at or near the top of the charts. He also developed a pitch-black sense of humor, and in his rich, mocking baritone explored songs about Soviet dictators and the spiritual poverty of men who only feel human in the company of whores. </p>
<p>""Jackie"", the single released in advance of <i>Scott 2</i>, was banned by the BBC. When the album came out, it went to Number 1. It remains the first recorded instance of the hyphenated adjective ""stupid-ass"" that I can think of. By 1969 Walker was writing epics about Ingmar Bergman movies featuring dissonant choir arrangements and trumpets blowing through canyons of reverb. Around this time he was also given his own television show, where he performed all your toe-tapping and heart-rending favorites in black sunglasses, without smiling. </p>
<p>This is the Scott Walker of the late 1960s: As passionately invested in covers of Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra hits as in singing the word ""gonorrhea""; voted ""Mr. Valentine"" by <i>Disc &amp; Music Echo</i> the same year he released a song about a young man routinely raped by military officers. His best performances convey the deep tragedy of their subjects while managing to laugh at them with a cruelty and indifference available to only the most total of douchebags.</p>
<p>The essential contrast in his late-60s albums is between easy-listening music and forbiddingly difficult subject matter. It's a dichotomy that has always made Walker seem more like an outsider artist than a mainstream one. It's also fodder for a case that Walker was ""subversive,"" an accolade for alternative-music fans who, especially now, can recast him as some kind of mole inside the machine, exposing the innocent people of Britain to material that would make their middle-class spines shiver. This isn't untrue. But it also smoothes over the fact that the <i>Scott</i> albums are different pieces of music that leave different impressions. Any attempt to lump them together is more a matter of laziness or historical convenience than anything else. If you look at the credits from <i>Scott</i> onward, what you see, essentially, is Walker taking over the show: on <i>Scott</i>, he wrote three songs among its 12, the rest covers; by <i>Scott 4</i>, he wrote them all. </p>
<p>Walker's choice of covers essentially falls into two camps: Easygoing heartbreak music and songs by the Belgian writer Jacques Brel. The latter's impact on Walker can't be understated: Walker covered him nine times on his first three albums, and some of the most elegant expressions of Walker's romantic but poisoned worldview are his. Take ""The Girls and the Dogs"", from <i>Scott 2</i>, a psychopathically chipper song about how men are longing, women are fickle, and dogs are lucky to not care either way. ""The dogs, well you know the dogs, they lift up a leg as they see it end/ The dogs, well you know the dogs, and maybe that's why they're man's best friend,"" goes the refrain. ""And yet,"" Walker sings toward the end, ""it's because of the girls, when they've knocked us about and our tears want to shout/ That we kick the dogs out."" Over the course of about 10 seconds, his voice hardens from drippy sympathy to resolute meanness, and as the song fades out, he defers to a choir of trombones that sound like they wandered out of a burlesque show. In essence: The world is a monochromatically cruel place, so ha ha ha, fuck it.</p>
<p>Walker's own songs are more ambiguous. From <i>Scott 2</i>, ""The Amorous Humphrey Plugg"" tells the story of a deflated husband who finds his peace of mind wandering thorugh the red-light district at night. ""Leave it all behind me,"" he sings, sailing away on a tide of violins. ""Screaming kids on my knee and the telly swallowing me/ And the neighbors shouting next door/ And the subway trembling the rollerskate floor."" Like good satire, Jacques Brel's songs cue you to laugh then startle you with reality. Walker puts you in the uncomfortable position of wondering whether to laugh in the first place, or to just lean back and allow these characters a glory that eludes them in their own lives.</p>
<p>Then there are songs like the simple, country-influenced ""Duchess"", from <i>Scott 4</i>. The same singer who rejected psychedelia started writing the kind of impressionistic lyrics whose nonsense is more penetrating than anything more literal could be. ""It's your shiftless flesh and your old-girl's grace,"" he sighs. ""It's your young girl's face that I'm breathing."" In both sound and lyric, Walker's music became more and more evocative, leaving behind the easy gratification of his earlier albums for broad, cinematic arrangements and stories that end not on punch lines, but question marks.</p>
<p>There are defenders of 1970's <i>'Til The Band Comes In.</i> I am not one of them, and for what it's worth, neither was Walker. Reportedly puzzled by the fact that his audience wasn't interested in dense songs about hookers and child abuse, he made the humble mistake of trying to will himself back to popularity. It has redeeming moments-- like the eulogistic ""Joe""-- but not many. Its worst songs are embarrassing: In an irony Walker could probably appreciate in time, he'd become one of the gloriously desperate people he'd sung about only a year or two earlier.</p>
<p>For anyone who hasn't heard Scott Walker before, the prospect of buying a five-album box set like <i>The Collection</i> is ridiculous. For fans that already own these albums, it's absurd. The recordings are, of course, ""remastered,"" which I can discern only in fleeting moments. And unlike the now out-of-print <i>In </i><i>Five Easy Pieces</i>, whose discs were organized by theme, <i>The Collection</i> goes for a straightforward archival treatment, with a nice selection of period interviews and a beautifully synthesized essay by Rob Young, an editor at British experimental-music magazine <i>The Wire</i>.</p>

Walker quickly became uncomfortable with this, and in 1967 went solo with four theatrical and increasingly dark albums, all called <i>Scott</i>. ""GOING SOLO IN A MONASTERY!"" a headline in <a href=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0vwntTBEN1qbjiaso1_500.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Melody Maker</i></a> read-- a monastery Walker had to leave because fans started banging on the door looking for him.</p>
<p>The <i>Scott </i>albums-- now remastered and collected into a box set with 1970's <i>'Til The Band Comes In</i>-- are the fulcrum of Walker's career: You can hear where he'd been, and in retrospect, where he was going; his third act was emerging after 20 years of almost total silence with <i>Tilt</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8764-the-drift/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Drift</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17387-bish-bosch/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bish Bosch</i></a>,<i> </i>released between 1997 and 2012. Walker's latter-day albums are fearless and violent, featuring wailing donkeys, moans, scrapes, and famously, the sound of someone punching meat. They seem to have been written in another language entirely.</p>
<p>The <i>Scott</i> albums, however, remain part of a tradition of highly arranged, rock-free music that valued old songs over new sounds and professionalism over innovation. ""I don't wanna see my fans walking around like drugged zombies,"" Walker told a journalist around the time <i>Scott</i> came out in 1967, a rejection of the psychedelic culture prevalent at the time. Instead, he embraced conventionally gorgeous, string-heavy music targeted at housewives and elderly people. At the same time, he fell headlong into existentialist literature and European art-house cinema. He appeared on variety shows, and remained either at or near the top of the charts. He also developed a pitch-black sense of humor, and in his rich, mocking baritone explored songs about Soviet dictators and the spiritual poverty of men who only feel human in the company of whores. </p>
<p>""Jackie"", the single released in advance of <i>Scott 2</i>, was banned by the BBC. When the album came out, it went to Number 1. It remains the first recorded instance of the hyphenated adjective ""stupid-ass"" that I can think of. By 1969 Walker was writing epics about Ingmar Bergman movies featuring dissonant choir arrangements and trumpets blowing through canyons of reverb. Around this time he was also given his own television show, where he performed all your toe-tapping and heart-rending favorites in black sunglasses, without smiling. </p>
<p>This is the Scott Walker of the late 1960s: As passionately invested in covers of Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra hits as in singing the word ""gonorrhea""; voted ""Mr. Valentine"" by <i>Disc &amp; Music Echo</i> the same year he released a song about a young man routinely raped by military officers. His best performances convey the deep tragedy of their subjects while managing to laugh at them with a cruelty and indifference available to only the most total of douchebags.</p>
<p>The essential contrast in his late-60s albums is between easy-listening music and forbiddingly difficult subject matter. It's a dichotomy that has always made Walker seem more like an outsider artist than a mainstream one. It's also fodder for a case that Walker was ""subversive,"" an accolade for alternative-music fans who, especially now, can recast him as some kind of mole inside the machine, exposing the innocent people of Britain to material that would make their middle-class spines shiver. This isn't untrue. But it also smoothes over the fact that the <i>Scott</i> albums are different pieces of music that leave different impressions. Any attempt to lump them together is more a matter of laziness or historical convenience than anything else. If you look at the credits from <i>Scott</i> onward, what you see, essentially, is Walker taking over the show: on <i>Scott</i>, he wrote three songs among its 12, the rest covers; by <i>Scott 4</i>, he wrote them all. </p>
<p>Walker's choice of covers essentially falls into two camps: Easygoing heartbreak music and songs by the Belgian writer Jacques Brel. The latter's impact on Walker can't be understated: Walker covered him nine times on his first three albums, and some of the most elegant expressions of Walker's romantic but poisoned worldview are his. Take ""The Girls and the Dogs"", from <i>Scott 2</i>, a psychopathically chipper song about how men are longing, women are fickle, and dogs are lucky to not care either way. ""The dogs, well you know the dogs, they lift up a leg as they see it end/ The dogs, well you know the dogs, and maybe that's why they're man's best friend,"" goes the refrain. ""And yet,"" Walker sings toward the end, ""it's because of the girls, when they've knocked us about and our tears want to shout/ That we kick the dogs out."" Over the course of about 10 seconds, his voice hardens from drippy sympathy to resolute meanness, and as the song fades out, he defers to a choir of trombones that sound like they wandered out of a burlesque show. In essence: The world is a monochromatically cruel place, so ha ha ha, fuck it.</p>
<p>Walker's own songs are more ambiguous. From <i>Scott 2</i>, ""The Amorous Humphrey Plugg"" tells the story of a deflated husband who finds his peace of mind wandering thorugh the red-light district at night. ""Leave it all behind me,"" he sings, sailing away on a tide of violins. ""Screaming kids on my knee and the telly swallowing me/ And the neighbors shouting next door/ And the subway trembling the rollerskate floor."" Like good satire, Jacques Brel's songs cue you to laugh then startle you with reality. Walker puts you in the uncomfortable position of wondering whether to laugh in the first place, or to just lean back and allow these characters a glory that eludes them in their own lives.</p>
<p>Then there are songs like the simple, country-influenced ""Duchess"", from <i>Scott 4</i>. The same singer who rejected psychedelia started writing the kind of impressionistic lyrics whose nonsense is more penetrating than anything more literal could be. ""It's your shiftless flesh and your old-girl's grace,"" he sighs. ""It's your young girl's face that I'm breathing."" In both sound and lyric, Walker's music became more and more evocative, leaving behind the easy gratification of his earlier albums for broad, cinematic arrangements and stories that end not on punch lines, but question marks.</p>
<p>There are defenders of 1970's <i>'Til The Band Comes In.</i> I am not one of them, and for what it's worth, neither was Walker. Reportedly puzzled by the fact that his audience wasn't interested in dense songs about hookers and child abuse, he made the humble mistake of trying to will himself back to popularity. It has redeeming moments-- like the eulogistic ""Joe""-- but not many. Its worst songs are embarrassing: In an irony Walker could probably appreciate in time, he'd become one of the gloriously desperate people he'd sung about only a year or two earlier.</p>
<p>For anyone who hasn't heard Scott Walker before, the prospect of buying a five-album box set like <i>The Collection</i> is ridiculous. For fans that already own these albums, it's absurd. The recordings are, of course, ""remastered,"" which I can discern only in fleeting moments. And unlike the now out-of-print <i>In </i><i>Five Easy Pieces</i>, whose discs were organized by theme, <i>The Collection</i> goes for a straightforward archival treatment, with a nice selection of period interviews and a beautifully synthesized essay by Rob Young, an editor at British experimental-music magazine <i>The Wire</i>.</p>
<p>It is ultimately yet another example of a record company attempting to re-brand material still available to consumers. Walker is a cult artist, more obscure than he ever was in the late 1960s but also more intensely beloved. You can almost hear the saliva of marketing teams hitting conference-room desks at the prospect of issuing 180-gram gatefold vinyl. Still, there are worse artists to focus the effort on. In a 2008 <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/09/scott-walker-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with the <i>Guardian</i>, Walker blamed some of his ugly output in the 1970s on label pressures to ""stay in the game""-- a convenient story coming from an artist, but if there's any truth to it, <i>The Collection </i>is a simple but elegant way of repaying some of the debt.</p></div>"|18088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18088-scott-walker-scott-walker-the-collection-1967-1970/|9.0|Mike Powell

That record rocketed the band into a series of unlikely tours with everyone from rap legend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10332-slick-rick/"" target=""_blank"">Slick Rick</a>-- who once enlisted them as his backing band-- to the punk and metal upstarts on the Vans Warped Tour. Bad Rabbits’ audience steadily grew, but their repertoire of songs remained puzzlingly static. In 2011, with no new release in sight, they launched a quick stopgap cover series: a lumbering, crunchy rendition of Michael Jackson’s “Human Nature”, a taut, synth-heavy trek through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"" target=""_blank"">Smashing Pumpkins</a>’ “1979” and straight reads of songs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">The-Dream</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1051-deftones/"" target=""_blank"">Deftones</a>. The cover series might’ve aimed for homage, but it also revealed a startling versatility. Bad Rabbits were bigger than the freewheeling funk revivalism of <i>Stick Up Kids</i> let on. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Bad Rabbits have finally released a full length in <i>American Love</i>, which was produced by Bay area instrumental hip-hop whiz B. Lewis. (They’re also said to be putting the finishing touches on another project with the help of new jack swing forbear Teddy Riley and Deftones leader Chino Moreno.) <i>American Love </i>finds the band eager to show off the moves they’ve learned since <i>Stick Up Kids</i>. Singer Dua Boakye twists limber vocal melodies into meaty harmonies throughout, especially on “Dirty”, where a chorus of backing vocals flank his pleading lead with flatly sung scales approximating Gregorian chant. “Doin’ It” and “Dance Moves” find the rest of the band dallying with Latin music behind him, the former pitting samba rhythms against funk ones and the latter pairing a freestyle-informed bass riff with salsa horns that comes off like a modern day Miami Sound Machine. “We Can Roll” and “Sayonara” both skate in on crunchy, psychedelic breakdowns, a musculature of rhythm that might be attributable to drummer Sheel Davé, who also plays in the Massachusetts math metal band Irepress. It’s a power that makes methodical rock numbers like “Fall in Love” oddly heavy one minute and gives “Sayonara” a buoyant swing the next.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The band’s newfound musical breadth meets a perfect shaman in B. Lewis, whose own cosmic boom bap favors a dense maximalism not unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> at full tilt. Lewis’ ace sonic architecture leaves <i>American Love </i>brimming with interlocking instrumental tracks and vocal melodies neatly stacked in unexpected corners. Every guitar lick and squiggly synth figure is given fair breathing room, and underheard hooks and submerged melodies constantly reveal themselves on repeat listens. It makes the band’s earlier work seem lean and maybe even claustrophobic by comparison. There’s also the sense that some of the album’s hazier passages, like the intro of opener “We Can Roll”, which teases a spartan rock workout out of a spectral, ambient mist, and the burbling synth underpinning of “Get Up and Go”, might be the result of Lewis’ influence. While <i>American Love </i>finds both band and producer working with an expanded sonic palette, the fundamental mechanics of Bad Rabbits’ songwriting still remain relatively unchanged. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Bad Rabbits still espouse a sex-positive randiness that puts them in the direct lineage of lustful R&amp;B maestros like Bobby Brown, and Dua’s lyrics explore the same axis between new love and unfettered lust. Bad Rabbits’ greatest trick is still the way the music genuflects to bygone forms of R&amp;B music without getting too mired in period-specific production quirks and hero worship that might date the music. The growth spurt between <i>Stick Up Kids </i>and <i>American Love </i>resembles the moment in the mid-90s where another soul band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14945-raphael-saadiq/"" target=""_blank"">Raphael Saadiq</a>’s Tony! Toni! Toné!, cashed out on their new jack swing contemporaries and set a course for the music of their parents, a direction that ended up inadvertently kicking off the neo-soul movement. Bad Rabbits have a few kinks to work out still, but with a crack band, a nimble vocalist, and the tutelage of Teddy Riley, they’re certainly headed in the right direction.</p></div>"|18181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18181-bad-rabbits-american-love/|7.5|Craig Jenkins

It’s right there in the title, taken from another lyric: “You’re home/ Long enough to leave/ Always coming back to see / How far off you’ve gone.” The feeling of absence is constant-- everyone in these songs seems to disappear.</p>
<p>That effect gives <i>Long Enough to Leave </i>an intriguing tension, because musically it’s nowhere near distant or detached. It’s an open, outward-looking set of tunes, especially compared to the Mantles’ previous full-length, their 2009 self-titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13796-the-mantles/"">debut</a>. That record had a hermetic feel that was a big part of its charm. The blurry chords and closeted sound-- a kind of rawer, denser take on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"">Byrds</a> and their Paisley Underground descendents <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_Syndicate"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Dream Syndicate</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17683-the-rain-parade/"">the Rain Parade</a>-- were a lot of fun to get lost in.</p>
<p>Here, by contrast, we get a wider variety of melodies, an airier sonic space, and a broader array of reference points. The familiar ones persist: opener “Marbled Birds” starts with a wiry hook that sounds exactly like marbled Byrds. But the acoustic-heavy title track evokes the melancholy pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"">the Clean’s</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2286-david-kilgour/"">David Kilgour</a>; the jangly “Don’t Cross Town” and winding “More That I Pay” approximate lo-fi <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"">R.E.M.</a>; and the wistful chords of “Raspberry Thighs” conjure <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"">Real Estate</a>’s sun-baked lilt. None of these tunes are clones; all are distinguished by Olivares’ deceptively-rough singing and the interplay of swirling guitars. But together all the echoes-- I’m also hearing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2304-the-kinks/"">the Kinks</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4341-television/"">Television</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies/"">the Feelies</a>-- show the Mantles have expanded their palette.</p>
<p>The result is catchy, consistent material that’s welcoming sonically but mysterious thematically. Take <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15418-the-mantles-hello/"">“Hello”</a>, a bouncy jam which is ostensibly pretty communicative; it’s about making a phone call, after all. But eventually you realize the caller-- who wants someone to “help me get out of here... help me disappear”-- never quite gets through. Even better is the enthralling “Reason’s Run”, whose coiled hooks become barbed wire when paired with distancing admonishments like, “When you saw me ahead, you should’ve crossed the street… you must be more careful about who you meet.""</p>
<p>All this poetic exploration of distance and disconnect can also just be seen as cake-icing. The Mantles could mumble through these tunes and the infectious force of their woven melodies would remain intact. But the extra thematic layer gives the music<i> </i>a depth that bodes well for this band’s future (and justifies their rate of output, which is glacial compared to their super-prolific <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7951-positive-destruction-san-franciscos-new-garage-rock/"">garage peers</a> in San Francisco). Because they take their time, what exactly that future holds is, like the best parts of <i>Long Enough to Leave</i>, compellingly elusive.</p></div>"|18115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18115-the-mantles-long-enough-to-leave/|7.5|Marc Masters

Riding a foundation of doom metal, psych rock, and mournful country, the group (now a quintet) led by Gregg Kowalsky and Marielle Jakobsons builds soundscapes with keyboards, mournful slide guitar, sitar, flute and a powerful electric bass. Their second album, <i>The Dusted Sessions</i>, ties together modern explorations of the Wild West with more traditional forms, infused with Americana but not giving into its clichés.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">What separates Date Palms from troves of drifting psych rock bands is their distinct sense of composition. These aren’t lengthy jams but painstakingly considered pieces that ebb and flow. <i>The Dusted Sessions</i> centers around a suite inspired by the Yuba River in California, once central to the Gold Rush and home to a vast Native American tribe that was all but wiped out. There’s a careful reverence to the three-part “Yuba Source”, with its central melody that winds wide like the broad curves of the river itself. As the quintet work their way through the track, they’re propped up by monstrous basslines that provide important momentum without ruffling feathers, and a constant sitar that shimmers like a pool of clear fresh water.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The teasing melody of “Yuba Source”-- a simple three note blues phrase-- appears throughout the record, on “Yuba”'s second part and reprise. The group repeat these ideas like mantras, gently echoing so that an idea passes through each instrument as if it were being purified. Jakobsons’ violin, which emerges as the star of the record, takes these melodies and unwinds them out into long, soft strokes while the slide guitar dovetails gracefully beneath.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Each track is defined by a different instrument, however. As tight of a unit as they are, Date Palms are also pretty versatile. On “Dusted Down”, a searing electric guitar rises above the dusty tumult, and on “Exodus Due West” Jakobsons’ reverbed flute haunts the landscape. Kowalsky’s keyboards play an almost equally important role, especially in creating a wall-of-sound effect, as on centerpiece “Night Riding the Skyland”. Especially breathtaking on the latter, the viola merges with the synth before it’s all broken up by the thrust of Noah Philips’ electric guitar, diving head-first into a blues jam that recalls early-70s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd</a> and other psychedelic cornerstones.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That they can do all this on a single album is a testament to Date Palms’ ability and control as an ensemble. Even with 11-minute tracks, there’s not a moment that feels wasted; with so many different sounds and ideas invoked over <i>The Dusted Sessions’ </i>44 minutes, there’s a clear idea at work even if it’s hard to quantify exactly what it is, which is where their brilliance lies. If the idea of Wild West-style slabs of desert rock doesn’t appeal to you, Kowalsky and Jakobsons will pull you in with their teasing melodies and weeping instruments anyway, their sound rough and immense like a sandpaper sky. On <i>The Dusted Sessions</i> they both deconstruct and reinforce the tenets of Americana and make something transcendent in the process.</span> </p></div>"|18158.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18158-date-palms-the-dusted-sessions/|7.9|Andrew Ryce

He seemed at the time capable of expanding the borders of bass music, a maverick in a scene where progress is still regarded as hugely important. Things haven't quite turned out that way. As peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29526-pearson-sound/"" target=""_blank"">Pearson Sound</a> have added their styles to an impressive history of U.K. electronic music (referred to as the <a href=""http://thewire.co.uk/in-writing/essays/the-wire-300_simon-reynolds-on-the-hardcore-continuum_introduction"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""hardcore continuum""</a> by journalist Simon Reynolds) Zomby has retreated into the canon, dragging up the bits-- grime's arcane melodic sense, U.K. Garage's shifty rhythms, dubstep's disorientation-- that best promote a perverse, personal history. Put more simply, Zomby likes to play progressive, but he's a synthesist at heart.</p>
<p>Never has this been more apparent than on Zomby's third album (and second for 4AD), <i>With Love</i>. A two-disc set of short, nimble tracks loosely divided by attitude (""tough"" on disc one, ""contemplative"" on disc two), <i>With Love</i> is an abundance, an unabashed display of affection for that continuum. The execution is still very much Zomby: With Love veers sharply from rhythmic duress to stoned calm. For an immersion experience, it's reckless and inattentive.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Complicating matters, the album offers few signposts. Zomby still works with vocals, but they're less intrusive than on past albums. Even the requisite 90s R&amp;B sample-- this from Brandy &amp; Monica's 1998 hit, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yh2EJWDDf0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Boy Is Mine""</a>-- is played with more subtlety than in the past. On ""The Things You Do"" and ""If I Will"", mangled vocal snippets are masterfully woven into the track's tapestry. There's no <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Panda Bear</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zxFIhX7c9c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collaboration</a> or Gucci Mane remix to peg, and the result is a long, even run of tracks that allows Zomby to hide beautiful, idiosyncratic moments in his thickets of rhythm. ""Isis""' gentle, walking bassline and ""I Saw Golden Light""'s brassy malevolence pass quickly and without pretense, offering their wares and then bowing to the next track.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Zomby continues to show no interest in fleshing out his ideas, but there's a pleasing efficiency to the way <i>With Love</i>'s tracks move in and out of melodic phrases. His particular combination of dulcet synth tones and creeping leads tattoo these tracks, and his sense of rhythm stirs those ideas into hypnotic vignettes. <i>With Love</i> is less expansive than Zomby's early work; he's traded invention for the opportunity to explore every nook and cranny of his humid rhythm mazes. Like simple puzzles, the process and order of <i>With Love</i> transfix long after novelty has worn off.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Just as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12543-where-were-u-in-92/"" target=""_blank""><i>Where Were U in '92</i></a> played like a more vibrant and modern version of early 90s rave and hardcore, <i>With Love</i> offers a necessary sonic update on its inspirations. Drum &amp; bass plays an increased role (Zomby also wonders where you were in 95), allowing Zomby to run stormy drum attacks like ""It's Time"" full-stop into creeping symphonic pieces. The album snaps on a good system, its depth charge bass anchoring hopscotch leads and tittering hi-hats. Considering that so much of what Zomby draws on was made on cheap computers with limited software, the comparative sonic richness of <i>With Love</i>'s music is key. At times the album plays like an extended attempt to upgrade the haphazard majesty of white label grime tracks like DJ XTC's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHLPU66yLFY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Functions on the Low""</a>. Replacing a bleating, synthesized horn with a more harmonically complex tone separates Zomby from his source material, spiritually-- those shitty sounds were part of the appeal-- but also offers a crucial twist. <i>With Love</i> is reverent displacement: U.K. street music re-imagined as luxury.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>With Love</i>'s short, baroque tracks balance its overall largesse, leaving a purpled, blunted ambience. Zomby's sense of melody and tone is distinct enough that, intentional or not, it feels like motifs and phrases are repeated and expanded upon throughout. Zomby accomplishes this despite his abrasive sequencing, cramming discordant pieces next to one another. <i>With Love</i> is like a pocket book of poetry, a series of short thoughts only tangentially related. Zomby is the elegant menace, capable of beauty and great affect but too stoned or disinterested to fully commit. The tension between Zomby's adoration for his heroes and his aberrant creativity fuels <i>With Love</i>, less a homage to the past than an intensification of it.</p></div>"|18183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18183-zomby-with-love/|7.9|Andrew Gaerig

Their albums are recorded at an annual concert in Tokyo, and billed under the players’ names rather than a group moniker. And their first two, though filled with high-level improvisation, were somewhat amorphous. Lengthy (sometimes half-hour-plus) tracks felt more like one-off experiments-- albeit excellent ones-- than purposeful music.</p>
<p>Things began to shift with 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16417-imikuzushi/""><i>Imikuzushi</i></a>, an enthralling set of noise rock journeys that made the trio sound more like an actual band. On their follow-up, <i>Now While it Is Still Warm Let Us Pour in All the Mystery</i>, Haino, O’Rourke, and Ambarchi have landed squarely on the spot they were clearly moving toward. This is now unmistakably a seasoned, fully locked-in experimental rock band-- and, not coincidentally, one of the best around.</p>
<p>The differences emerge both in form and content. For the first time, the trio sticks to shorter pieces-- six in total, with none longer than 11 minutes. And those pieces progress in a distinct arc, one that suggests more craft and forethought than before. <i>Now While it Is Still Warm</i> starts with quieter, more ambient tracks, gradually escalates into louder songs, then ends with a denouement that’s all mood and atmosphere.</p>
<p>More importantly, each track has a distinct shape, often featuring clear beginnings, middles, and ends. Whether with meditative drones, hammering riffs, or heavy rhythms, the trio diligently carves out patterns every step of the way, with at least one eye on where to go and how to get there. This is especially true of three tracks in the middle of the album. Here, Haino churns out guitar pyrotechnics supported by O’Rourke’s bass loops and Ambarchi’s weighty drumming. These are rock jams, though they still retain the group’s essential spontaneity, mostly in Haino’s ability to quickly shift from a memorable riff to an abstract explosion.</p>
<p>Just as compelling are the subdued pieces that bookend <i>Now While it Is Still Warm</i>. Opener “Once Again I Hear the Beautiful Vertigo... Luring Us to 'Do Something, Somehow'” sees Haino moaning hypnotically over the accompaniment of wineglasses (one of which is manned by master minimalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14319-charlemagne-palestine/"">Charlemagne Palestine</a>). Later, Haino’s flute and O’Rourke’s stage-shaking bass create dark lounge-jazz in “Who Would Have Thought This Callous History Would Become My Skin”, and the gentle tension of the closing title track could score an <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Akira Kurosawa</a> noir thriller like <i>High and Low </i>or <i>The Bad Sleep Well</i>.</p>
<p>Those quieter pieces are so compelling that it’s tempting to hope for a future album made of nothing but. At the same time, it would be fascinating to hear the trio in tight-rock mode for an entire release. That’s the interesting paradox of <i>Now While it Was Still Warm: </i>by honing their music, the trio has actually widened it, showing how much they’re capable of.<i> </i>Haino, O’Rourke, and Ambarchi now sound like a band for whom anything is not just possible, but probable.</p></div>"|17974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17974-oren-ambarchi-keiji-haino-jim-orourke-now-while-its-still-warm-let-us-pour-in-all-the-mystery/|7.7|Marc Masters

For every euphoric <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKbLI8EufNo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Acid Tracks""</a> there was a nutty <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S23dIXK-TEw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Activ 8 (Come with Me)""</a>; the sublime <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lB17FCjrA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Voodoo Ray""</a> could effortlessly segue into the dayglo patchwork of<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkqidtHktME"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> ""Theme from S-Express""</a>. Those larger-than-life acid acts often had an absurd concept attached, or some grandiose scheme in mind. Chris Peat from pop-acid act Altern-8 even stood as a political candidate in the 1992 General Election in Britain, representing his own Hardcore (Altern8-ive) party. Needless to say, he didn’t get far. San Fernando Valley artist Zane Reynolds takes a similarly playful approach to the work he puts out under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30427-sfv-acid/"">SFV Acid</a> alias. On <i>The Dwell</i>, his debut full-length, he's patched together a series of tracks entirely written on equipment set up at his local Starbucks. In 2013, coffee buzz is the new acid rush.</p>
<p>There's a distinction to be made between the conceptual cloaking Reynolds has thrown over this work and the music found inside. Occasionally it's frivolous-- there's a skip in the step to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15475-pt-sex/"">""PT Sex""</a> that comes close to pushing it toward novelty status-- but mostly this is a surprisingly inward-looking work. It's reminiscent of the kind of juxtaposition found when encountering the public and creative faces of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Richard D. James</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4479-luke-vibert/"">Luke Vibert</a>. Outwardly, they're brash, prone to pranks, rarely keeping a straight face. But the music usually has a much deeper value. <i>The Dwell</i> takes a similar tone, working through mournful late night club jams like ""Fresh and Easy"" and ""Dwell on 2"". There's exuberance, too, but even that feels tempered by introspection. ""Mocha"" pulls hard on the feel of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/20271-grandmaster-flash-the-furious-five/"">Grandmaster Flash</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4o8TeqKhgY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Message""</a>, only to dampen it with a bittersweet whistling keyboard motif.</p>
<p>Reynolds has <a href=""http://fofmusic.net/press/sfv-acid"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stated</a> that this material was designed to echo the feel of small town moments, providing a soundtrack to the ""business parks, strip malls, and diner burgers"" he immerses himself in on a regular basis. It adds a loneliness to much of this work, a feeling of someone outside that world looking in. The struggle to connect is key, often throwing up moments of ugliness such as the distorted voice belching through the tinny rhythms of ""Money"". If the original acid movement sought to escape the everyday through a sense of communality, through people with wildly different values coming together under one roof, <i>The Dwell</i> veers in the opposite direction. The coffee shop recording studio positions Reynolds alone amid a small cross-section of society, where he retreats into his own head. It lends a dual sense of inclusion and exclusion, a feeling of being immersed in the world while being utterly removed from it.</p>
<p>That awareness of a creeping sense of isolation while being connected to society en masse isn’t particularly unique, although it is at least intriguing that Reynolds tried to get there via a template that was once all about finding a common bond. He's mostly let down by the execution, which leans too far toward overly familiar 303 acid sounds and house-y keyboard figures. Often the arrangements are too skeletal, or build a little too predictably. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a> did the ""lone raver"" concept a lot more effectively, capturing a sense of seclusion that this record only hints at on occasion. Mostly it feels like Reynolds stirred a few too many colors into the mix, lampooning old acid records, working out of a Starbucks, cooking up the ""small town"" theme, attempting to make something he describes as being ""steeped in blue collar luxury."" <i>The Dwell</i> buckles under the weight of that ambition, resulting in a work that never really finds a satisfying place of its own to go.</p></div>"|18083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18083-sfv-acid-the-dwell/|6.2|Nick Neyland

The latter stood out the most: While Spit's a good rapper who can catch a ride off mind-altering hedonism and sneak some blacklit profundity into the bargain, his touch with a chopped-up loop is impeccable, sourcing a long bloodline of classic West Coast funk-- g or otherwise-- and putting it to use shining god rays through cloud rap. While his beats have been almost exclusively used in his own work, it's easy to imagine him cranking out enough extra quality work to supply any of the likeminded MCs who parallel that aesthetic. And if for some reason you're not feeling his words, the beats go a long way in justifying them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Spit's latest beat tape, <i>Mansions 2</i>, is the second in a series of instrumental releases that narrows in on short little flashes of inspiration and strings them along for brief but engrossing moments. And while there's something that feels a little placeholder-ish about it-- his beats don't always feel complete without his liquid Evidence-turned-skate rat voice-- it measures up well in a crowded field filled with <i>Donuts</i>-vibing Cali bedroom beatmakers. If there's a drum loop on a track, best believe it'll get refracted, split, switched up, and scattered in a way that throws it out of joint without knocking it out of its groove. If there's an identifiable canonical sample, it'll be flipped in a way that's restlessly transformative-- slowed to a half-tempo crawl; phased into headswimming oblivion. If there's a vocal drop, it'll mean something more than just a one-liner distraction, as everything from Hustler's Convention's pool-shark verse (""Billiards for Billions"") to a kid's story about a trick-or-treating fatality (""...?"") to a news piece about a $220 million penthouse (""The Sky Is Falling"") builds a sonic travelogue that's like walking through a crumbling Richard Neutra house on a mushroom high.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As journeys go, the scenery changes frequently. One moment, it's all hazy boom-bap tweaks of early 80s R&amp;B for low-lit late-night smokeouts (""Cocaine""; ""Ouija Board Coffee Table""). The next, you might slide into a Southern-inflected cut with 808s that rattle like bill counters under a layer of diamond-shine electric pianos (""Pullover Hoodies""). The impact can gently wash over you with stripped-down codeine strings (""Kubrick Halls"") and jazz-piano minimalism (""Baldwin by the Endless Pool""), or run up and dummy-smack you until you've got prizefighter snares and Nintendo final-stage basslines rattling through your ears (""Panic Room""). While the mood tends to swing from mellowed-out bliss to mellowed-out dread, there's a dominant sense of unpredictable playfulness that coheres into its own self-contained universe.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Positioning Spit's work against that of his peers isn't the easiest comparative exercise-- it has all the hallmarks of whatever ""psychedelic instrumental hip-hop"" implies without incorporating the heavy-rock vibes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28105-the-gaslamp-killer/"" target=""_blank"">Gaslamp Killer</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a>'s grimy-workshop sludge, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>' art jazz leanings. And while he shares <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">Dilla</a>'s affinity for chopped vocal syllables and Tyco Nite-Glow bass, there are still enough elements from the last five years' worth of post-based airiness and bass-music fusion to duck carbon-copy affectations. It's one of those situations where playing games of spot-the-influence will inevitably end in those influences receding far off into the distance-- an album that sounds less like someone you've heard of than someplace you haven't.</p></div>"|18198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18198-alexander-spit-mansions-2/|7.0|Nate Patrin

But just as the Beatle's proclamation was fuller and wiser in context-- ""I believe that what people call God is something in all of us,"" Lennon would later explain-- ""I Am a God"" is not simply the latest self-important blast from one of pop culture's pre-eminent egoists. For starters, the track sounds less triumphant than breathtakingly vexed, crashing in with a gnarled <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=DNHAQJzUWH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dancehall vocal sample</a> and paranoid sawtooth synths that aim to destroy. Here, Kanye raps about loyalty, respect, threesomes, and, yes, <a href=""http://pitchfork.tumblr.com/post/53219216121#notes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">croissants</a> with the urgency of someone being chased by a 30-ton steamroller. The song is pierced by a series of primal screams, pixelated outbursts that are only briefly able to halt the beat's heaving evil. In Kanye's hands, being a god sounds stressful as hell, something we can all relate to, and the song's <span><a href=""https://twitter.com/malikyusef/statuses/316387475499143168"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">apparent inspiration</a> is</span> a passage from the book of Psalms: ""I have said, <a href=""http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-82-6/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Ye are gods</span></a>; and all of you are children of the most High.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">These are the immeasurably lofty stakes Kanye deals in on <i>Yeezus</i>, his sixth solo album. His intensity here has a heightened desperation as he howls into the void, but the Chicago native has always been beguiled by the view from above. Take ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jesus Walks</a>"", where he references another Psalm while gasping from on high: ""I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is/ Top floor, the view alone will leave you breathless."" Then, on ""POWER"", he contemplates leaping out of the penthouse, ""letting everything go."" In a way, <i>Yeezus</i> is the panicked sound of that ensuing free-fall, a rush of angst and despair with absolutely nothing left to lose. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album is something of a razor-sharpened take on 2008's distressed <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/"">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a></i> and marks a blunt break with the filigreed maximalism Kanye so thoroughly nailed on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/"">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a></i>. In hindsight, the latter record-- with its ingratiating GOOD Fridays buildup, endless guest list, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNMxHfmXKVU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">uncharacteristically apologetic interview sessions</a>-- was his attempt at recapturing a superstar-sized American audience after a slew of entertaining-yet-questionable PR <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/14/obama-kanye-is-a-jackass_n_286623.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">incidents</a>. Except it didn't exactly work: While <i>Twisted Fantasy</i> was universally lauded and went platinum, it still stands as Kanye's worst-selling album to date, failing to produce a top 10 single. But even if it wasn't a chart smash, the intricacy and durability of <i>Twisted Fantasy</i> incubated the Cult of Kanye to an extreme level. ""I’d rather piss a bunch of people off and make myself happy than make everyone else happy and be pissed off inside,"" he told <i><a href=""http://splitinfinitives.com/post/52947639353/i-really-believe-in-absolute-truth-a-nearly"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VIBE</a></i> around the release of <i>808s</i>. <i>Yeezus</i> doubles-down on this exclusionary philosophy: ""Soon as they like you, make 'em unlike you/ 'Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For Kanye, there's purpose in repulsion. And on <i>Yeezus</i>, he trades out smooth soul and anthemic choruses for jarring electro, acid house, and industrial grind while delivering some of his most lewd and heart-crushing tales yet. This is willful provocation that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"">Madonna</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Trent Reznor</a> could all be proud of. Some of the record has him tackling the same issues he's been rapping about since <i>The College Dropout</i>, albeit with a fire-eyed stare. On his debut's ""Family Business"", he poignantly lamented a jailed cousin's absence at the Thanksgiving dinner table in a manner ""so sweet, like a photo of your granny's picture."" On <i>Yeezus</i>, he's still addressing the plight of incarcerated black men, but now he's incensed. With ""New Slaves"", he confronts us with vulgar stereotypes while exposing the prison-industrial complex for the deeply systemic racist sham that it is.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Meanwhile, XXX creeper ""I'm In It"" sounds like a dancehall orgasm mired in quicksand and makes previous come-ons like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrMrqBcv6Mk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Slow Jamz""</a> come off like Disney theme songs. ""The kids and the wife life, but can't wake up from the nightlife,"" says the <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/06/15/it-girl-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-welcome-new-baby/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">new father</a> on that track's knowingly button-pushing final verse. ""I'm so scared of my demons/ I go to sleep with a nightlight."" Kanye told <i><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/arts/music/kanye-west-talks-about-his-career-and-album-yeezus.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The New York Times</a></i> he's recently reached a new level of Zen, but this is the opposite of beach-chair music. Perhaps the album's most explicit lines are the blurry fantasies of a confessed <a href=""http://realtalkny.uproxx.com/2007/04/topic/topic/news/kanye-west-a-porn-addict-since-being-young/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">porn addict</a> who's described his daughter's mother as a ""superstar all from a home movie."" Without much room for levity, Kanye's complicated and distrustful view of women is unrelenting on <i>Yeezus</i>. And while there's no real excuse for flat oafishness like ""eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce,"" many of the album's most powerful moments have him broken down, insecure, and bloody, railing against an ineptitude with the opposite sex.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Album pinnacle ""Blood on the Leaves"" tells a nightmarish story of divorce and betrayal, all while samples of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5062-nina-simone/"">Nina Simone</a>'s pitched-up ""Strange Fruit"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/"">TNGHT</a>'s demonic ""R U Ready"" horns play yin and yang to the protagonist's alternately sorrowful and furious headspace. ""Hold My Liquor"" and ""Guilt Trip"", meanwhile, find Kanye trying to restate his manhood while his emotions crumble around him; if he's not drunk and swerve-y, trying vainly to reconcile with an ex, he's hoping to brag himself out of being dumped. Caustic humor shows up now and then, buoying certain lines or tracks like ""Send It Up"" and ""Bound 2"", but it's often fleeting. As on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Runaway""</a>, there's something palpably sad about the men in these songs, which twists them away from misogynistic assertions of power toward feelings that are ultimately more self-destructive. As contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"">Jay-Z</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/"">Justin Timberlake</a> increasingly devote their music to largely winning tales of contentment, Kanye is unwilling or unable to settle for settling down.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This discomfort is essential to his enduring appeal. For instance, instead of working with giant phone companies to guarantee commercial success, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51187-jay-z-announces-new-lp-magna-carta-holy-grail/"">a la his big brother</a>, Kanye's now making a point out of rejecting corporate sponsorship. Whether it's a meaningful stance or a blindly contrarian move is up for debate. But after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50312-rick-ross-issues-formal-apology-for-controversial-ueono-verse/"">recent</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50600-lil-wayne-dropped-from-mountain-dew-over-emmitt-till-controvery-till-family-responds/"">tensions</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50587-tyler-the-creator-defends-mountain-dew-ad/"">between</a> <span>hip-hop and corporate America, visceral and disturbing lines like ""put my fist in her like a civil rights sign"" put Kanye beyond the reach of mainstream brands hoping to siphon his credibility.</span> As he told the <i>Times</i>, he's not disinterested in the idea of big companies or big money-- he compared himself to Steve Jobs, after all-- but he wants control. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The restlessness spreads to his aesthetic and collaborative choices. Rather than relying on known hitmakers to augment his music, Kanye solicited ideas from exciting up-and-comers including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"">Hudson Mohawke</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30552-young-chop/"">Young Chop</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"">Arca</a>. And even veteran producers involved in the project, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6945-rick-rubin/"">Rick Rubin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>, were seemingly chosen not for their name recognition but their history of rule-breaking. In the mid-1980s, Rubin veered away from the colorful, party-starting tones of early rap music and created bare, hard beats for LL Cool J, Run-D.M.C., and the Beastie Boys-- a perfect fit for <i>Yeezus</i>' less-is-more snarl. And though Kanye's blaring, digitized assault couldn't be further from Daft Punk's naturalistic, groove-based <i>Random Access Memories</i>, the artists share a basic philosophy. As Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter recently <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/daft-punk/"">said</a> of their new record: ""We had the luxury to do things that so many people cannot do, but it doesn't mean that with luxury comes comfort.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The idea extends to the how <i>Yeezus</i> treats the human voice. Running with the confounding hook from last year's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dqgr0wNyPo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mercy""</a>, dancehall patois is scattered throughout, bringing with it that music's sense of menacing confrontation. And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>'s Justin Vernon shows up on a few tracks, using his voice to give the darkness an angelic tint. Expanding upon the cracked vocal experimentation on <i>Twisted Fantasy</i>'s ""Blame Game"", Kanye's own voice is often shadowed by pitched-down ghouls. And though he could've likely chosen any rapper on earth to guest on the riotous ""Send It Up""-- probably the most likely, if not only, chance <i>Yeezus </i>has for a rap-radio hit-- he chose Chicago's relatively unknown <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30608-king-l/"">King L</a>. His presence, along with that of fellow Chi-town driller <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Chief Keef</a>, makes the message clear: America may want to ignore these young black men from the gang-strewn South Side, but here, they have a voice.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">All of these unlikely choices demonstrate how cohesion and bold intent are at a premium on <i>Yeezus</i>, perhaps more than any other Kanye album. Each fluorescent strike of noise, incongruous tempo flip, and warped vocal is bolted into its right place across the record's fast 40 minutes. The precise approach runs through <i>Yeezus</i>' guerrilla-style promotion, too, which found an army of dark vans lighting projections onto buildings around the world, itself a boots-on-the-ground reaction to today's InstaTweet brand of music dissemination. I went to one of these impromptu happenings last Saturday night, in the middle of Manhattan. At 1:20 a.m., the words ""NOT FOR SALE"" lit up on the south side of the Louis Vuitton building. A few guys ran across the street with Christmas-morning glee, snapping photos. Then, Kanye's starkly-lit visage appeared to recite ""New Slaves""'s anti-consumerist lines as cabs streaked by the luxury stores below. His was the only black face to be seen across the jumbo ads lining an eerily desolate 5th Ave. The van soon closed its doors and drove away; the culture bomb’s flash was over in an instant, but the reverberations were just starting to spread.</p></div>"|18172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/|9.5|Ryan Dombal

Bloggers and fans went nuts: as prolific as Madlib's traditionally been, the last true Quasimoto album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6612-the-further-adventures-of-lord-quas/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Further Adventures of Lord Quas</i></a> was released eight years ago, and something about that pranksterish mushroom-fueled split-personality vibe was still in high demand. Once it became clear that <i>Yessir Whatever </i>was actually going to be a compilation of rare and unreleased Quasimoto material and early experiments, anticipation simmered down a bit, but hey, old Quas is better than no Quas, right?</p>
<p>Right. That said, <i>Yessir Whatever </i>isn't an odds-and-ends consolation prize-- it's an interesting cross-section of Madlib's personal archives, and its scattershot nature is more a stylistic matter than a quality-control issue. The 12 songs on the album were written and recorded over a span of about a dozen years, going back at least as far as being concurrent with the earliest Lootpack releases (at least if the 1997 lyrical datestamp on “Brothers Can't See Me” is any indication). And even the earliest material here has that certain imprint that made the Quasimoto records so offbeat: mood-whiplash sequencing, tape-deck-quality fidelity with Jeep-quality beats, and rhymes that sound like a down-for-whatever stoner verbally sparring with the cartoon devil on his shoulder.</p>
<p>That familiar pitched-up voice starts the record on 2004's thousand-copy single “Broad Factor”, which opens with a declaration that “I know you're tired of dumb shit” and then goes on for a couple of verses about how good he is at getting his bone on. This isn't Madlib at his most esoteric: the beat's sourced from Johnny “Guitar” Watson's endlessly sampled “Superman Lover"", and even if the sex rhymes are fiendishly true to his alter-ego's altered id, they're also more slick than outrageous. Not to knock it, of course; Madlib's nearly as raw in classicist mode as he is when he lets his psychedelic/jazzbo inclinations take over. But the more off-the-path work he did in the early-mid 2000s has a strength that stretches far past pretty-good indie rap into the stuff that cults are made of, and it's that prime material from assorted limited-edition 7” releases and EPs that'll be the draw here. </p>
<p>“Seasons Change” was axed from <i>Further Adventures </i>when a Roy Ayers sample didn't clear in time, and what could've been the best cut on that album was relegated to the B-side of a “Bullysh!t” 7” released on the one-off label Lord Inamel's Wax in 2005. It's brought back here in full, a smooth-fusion lost classic that trades on a good vibes/bad vibes dichotomy and includes one of the better self-descriptions of the Madlib aesthetic going (“Top choice, low rate, no gate, high voice/ It's like we dipped the beat in water now we up on moist”). “The Front” and “Youngblood” were the respective A and B-sides of a 2005 Stones Throw Fan Club 45, and they fill the bill by emphasizing Madlib's own voice muttering restrained stress raps coolly through smooth jazz gone warped from repeated exposure to foundation-rattling low end. And going back a few years to 2002's <i>Astronaut </i>EP unearths a title track that, true to Quasimoto tradition, riffs off some Melvin Van Peebles <i>Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death </i>gems and careens disorientingly between three different voices-- Madlib, Quas and the sampled Van Peebles-- to jarringly conversational effect. There's also one of the best-spit lines you'll ever hear from Madlib's voice, pitched-up or otherwise; the way he rattles off “wouldn't be no more angel to me... <i>anyway</i>” is a surprising salvo of acrobatic flow from a helium voice that usually sounds casually flippant.</p>
<p>A good part of this collection trades a bit on the mythology of those seldom-heard early Quasimoto experiments of the late 90s, when it was just stuff Madlib kept between himself and a few friends who were privy to his beat tapes. And while there's nothing revelatory production-wise if you've heard Lootpack's <i>Soundpieces: Da Antidote</i>, there's a little workshopper's insight in these protoypes for <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6613-the-unseen/"" target=""_blank"">The </a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6613-the-unseen/"" target=""_blank""><i>Unseen</i></a>-caliber bluntedness. They're a bit more focused (and less attention-grabbing) than ensuing years' choppy, non-sequitur-filled Quasimoto joints, rolling off a sound that aims to synthesize East Coast boom-bap into something a bit more sun-baked. The sleepy guitar loop on “Planned Attack” and the squeaky synthesizer whistle on “Brothers Can't See Me” are, along with his nothing-fancy scratching, the only things really brought in to accompany the breaks. But the drums are heavy enough and smartly assembled to the point that Madlib's foundation was clearly already pretty strong. And even if the spare, downbeat early draft of “Green Power” here doesn't measure up to the intricate, layered bop-bounce of the <i>Unseen </i>version, it still doesn't sound like much that was going on back in the late '90s-- and it was actually enough to start building one of the most voracious cult fanbases in hip-hop, so here we are. This isn't the new Quas album people might've hoped for, but as someone who values the obscure and underheard in other peoples' work, it's good to know Madlib has the same context, respect, and enthusiasm for his own vaults, too.</p></div>"|18173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18173-quasimoto-yessir-whatever/|7.4|Nate Patrin

Bassist Joe McCann, vocalist/guitarist Mars Ganito, guitarist Jade Payne, and drummer Angie Boylan have stressed repeatedly that their politics are essential to their standing as queer, multi-racial, multi-gendered musicians. Yet the pop punk style they've perfected over the past few years has, historically, run contrary to that identity. Especially as the genre was enjoying its peak commercial successes in the early 2000s, pop punk's social conservatism helped market an innocuous breed of suburban, digestible rebellion to as wide an American population as possible.</p>
<p>Aye Nako, a band that is anything but macho, say they've attempted to distance themselves from that world, but their self-released, full-length debut <i>Unleash Yourself </i>maintains those ties. Its riffs and melodies barely diverge from traditional pop punk; the sugar rush arrives with an archetypal, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17781-blink-182/"">Blink-182</a>-like sweep within the first 10 seconds of opener ""Start Talking"", and gives way only selectively throughout the record's 35-minute cartwheel. Considering that the grittier, more hardcore-influenced tracks from the band's 2010 demo didn't make the LP cut, it seems that Aye Nako's aesthetic has indulged more deeply into its pop punk tendencies than ever.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Aye Nako's greatest strength is their ability to bend the once-rigid constraints of pop punk style to better reflect their unique experiences. They inject new life into the genre by redefining it as the outsider space it was intended as in the first place, using it to explore subjects like love that's complicated by questions of gender identity and sexuality. Still, that juxtaposition of wisdom and childishness sometimes gets the better of them: ""Cut it Off""'s deep-digging lyrics, ""Break your own legs/ What this condition may reveal/ Is how you only take a sip when it’s watered down"" fit awkwardly and indistinctly among Ganito and Payne's stricter, more decisive chord progressions. But as all four Nakos erupt like Lost Boys into puppyish yowls at the end of the fittingly titled ""Howl"", you can't help but be thankful for that precarious young-old balance, whether or not it always comes off.</p>
<p>As for whether <i>Unleash Yourself</i> will hit home with the audience Aye Nako hopes to reach, that depends on what its members choose to do with it. The band has said in interviews that that its raison d'etre is to make the music they didn't have as queer teenagers, to provide empowerment for younger generations. <i>Unleash Yourself </i>succeeds on that level. But like many albums whose makers staunchly maintain D.I.Y. values, often to the point of self-exile, Aye Nako's debut runs the risk of flying under the radars of less-plugged-in kids who could benefit from their empowering messages. Whether or not <i>Unleash Yourself </i>finds its way into the hands of those teenagers, though, its universally charming launch pad resurrects a strained and tired world as something new, urgent, and far more substantive.</p></div>"|18205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18205-aye-nako-unleash-yourself/|7.6|Devon Maloney

He also moved to Tokyo, and essentially started over. ""There are people who know me from Ponytail, but that’s a fairly small group, so I’m playing to a pretty new crowd,"" he <a href=""http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/05/23/music/guitarist-dustin-wong-brings-singer-takako-minekawa-out-on-a-toropical-journey/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told the <i>Japan Times</i></a> recently. One of the people who found their way to one of Wong's shows was <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2776-takako-minekawa/"" target=""_blank"">Takako Minekawa</a>, the artist and musician who was once an integral part of Tokyo's colorful shibuya-kei scene-- a genially hyperactive, stylish music of the 1990s that skimmed the sugar rush off of lounge pop and cocktail jazz. Minekawa had married the musician Cornelius and mostly stopped making music.</p>
<p>The two, discovering they had a lot in common, found their way to making <i>Toropical Circle</i>, Wong's first collaborative effort since Ponytail disbanded in 2011 and Minekawa's first project in 13 years. <i>Toropical Circle</i> is a lot of things you associate with both Ponytail and Minekawa-- the music is bright, fizzy, exuberant, playful. Wong's solo records, while pleasant, also felt like student exercises from someone working out new forms, but <i>Toropical Circle</i> feels like the record where he takes those techniques and applies them to something more idiosyncratic. Wong fills every corner of the mix on <i>Circle</i> with fascinating sounds, and the record is less a collection of songs than a loose bag of baubles. Picking them out and examining them one by one is the fun of it.</p>
<p>In Wong's hands, the guitar shrinks down to a toy and turns a thousand shades of robin's-egg blue: Sometimes he resembles a shimmering gamelan ensemble (""Swimming Between Parallel Times""); sometimes, a music box slowly winding down. The guitars on ""party on a floating cake"" (all of the tracks are well named-- ""Party On a Floating Cake"" nails the album's vibe more succinctly than a review could hope to) are brittle and spiny, like tiny hedgehogs being raked with plastic combs. Over the song's last two minutes, Wong plays tight, pinched little solos high up on the neck, surrounding these little pinging noises with sighing washes of synth. His sound is pearly and fragile, evoking a Renaissance harpsichord more than anything with electricity coursing through it, and he and Minekawa put a fine point on the album's mood with not one, but two interpolations of ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"".</p>
<p>Minekawa's light, airy voice floats throughout the mix; on the well-named ""Windy Prism Room"", her voice acts as the titular breeze sighing through Wong's fingerpicking. She often sticks to ""oooh"" and ""la la la,"" or ""doot-doo,"" picking out hummingbird melodies that complement Wong's. On ""New Circle Has Begun"", she weaves a charming needlepoint around Wong's guitar, an infectious little melody wandering in a maze of counter-melodies. <i>Toropical Circle</i> builds up layers sneakily this way, and despite being as lovingly confected as a wedding cake, feels casual, like it was abstractedly hummed into existence. It's a low-stakes affair in the best sense; Wong and Minekawa seem to have made this album as simply as little kids invent a story together. For Wong, it's a way to remind us of his still-developing voice and talent; for Minekawa, it's a wonderfully low-key way to ease back into the world of music-making after a long hiatus.</p></div>"|18005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18005-takako-minekawa-dustin-wong-tropical-circle/|6.6|Jayson Greene

The muted, lo-fi rhythmic jam pop of HWGM’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12724-here-we-go-magic/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a> shares a warm, kindred vibe with <i>In Limbo</i>’s stretched out psych pop, with both albums featuring identical dampened, slightly murky production, a penchant for eclectic, syncopated percussion, and lead vocalists-- Luke Temple and Lieberson, respectively-- sharing quirky, quiet registers that sound like additional accompaniment rather than a sonic focal point.</p>
<p><i>In Limbo</i>'s surprising strength arose from Lieberson’s coolly confident approach. It allowed the band to try on textures and styles-- bass-driven Krautrock, ambient space rock, ethereal art pop-- from song to song without seeming too strained or too indulgent, even if they never really coalesced into a coherent sound. The result was a collection of tracks that were easier to admire than enjoy, assuredly hitting high notes like the trembling, infectious indie pop of lead track “Better” but stumbling over experiments like the amorphous, occasionally gorgeous mini-epic “Unable”.</p>
<p>Arriving within a year of their first album, TEEN’s <i>Carolina</i> EP is a pretty dramatic leap forward in terms of focus, production, and songwriting. The quartet opted to pare down their compositions after the effects-heavy <i>In Limbo</i>, recording five songs that could be replicated live without compromise. But an interesting thing happened in the name of simplicity: the scrubbed production (courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29923-dive/"" target=""_blank"">DIIV</a> collaborator Daniel Schlett) and de-muted sonic palette allow the new batch of tracks to bloom impressively, in ways the shadowy corners of lo-fi bedroom pop just can’t. It’s a wise approach considering Lieberson’s deceptively busy and labyrinthe songwriting. Now, TEEN’s byzantine harmonies, mathy guitar work, and sparkling organ parts pop with a Technicolor brightness that makes <i>In Limbo</i> sound like it was recorded in Robert Pollard’s basement.</p>
<p>Although Teenie Lieberson’s breathy, halted lyrics can be frustratingly opaque, the composition of a song like ""Carolina"" is dizzying-- the seasick horns in the chorus, the shimmering guitar ripples during the verses-- and the harmonization between the four principles is well stacked, building to the song's thrashing climax. Its go-for-broke fullness definitely feels like a transitional moment for TEEN, one that could serve as a jumping off point for their next full-length release.</p>
<p>Even the other high points of <i>Carolina</i> benefit from the chances taken in the title track; the relatively straightforward rocker “Circus” continues to deploy Lieberson’s chunky guitar sound, horn section, and loping sonic momentum. The other highlight, the more delicate “Cannibal”, quakes and pops with handclaps and noodly guitar work and keeps pace with another funhouse melody that never seems to sit still.</p>
<p>Those first three songs here feel like suites of the same movement, based around the title track. On the final two songs, the experiments seem lazy and unfocused: The long and slow dirge of “Glass Cage” and the overblown, disjointed guitar rock of “Paradise” seem like TEEN mistaking jammy looseness and frayed edges for artistic license. With some fine tuning, TEEN’s could work become confident and dynamic. For now, like <i>In Limbo</i>, <i>Carolina</i> suffers from a lack of decision-making.</p></div>"|18197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18197-teen-carolina-ep/|6.0|Patrick Bowman

They serve a touchstone for electronic producers interested in apparitional mystery and their music gets placed in movies when directors are looking for a shortcut to beatific beauty. Conversely, with the exception of the Animal Collective-styled “Gobbledigook,” not one Sigur Rós song has suggested a contemporary outside influence. But they'd become trapped by their singularity: By 2008’s gluttonously orchestrated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11924-me-su-i-eyrum-vi-spilum-endalaust/""><i>Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust</i></a>, they appeared stuck in an escalating arms race with their past work and on last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16628-sigur-ros-valtari/"">Valtari</a>, </i>Sigur Rós didn’t feel like a human entity anymore, just a collection of textural signifiers that confirmed their critics’ view of them as credible New Age.</p>
<p><i>Valtari </i>sounded like a dead end, and it did turn out to be the end of Sigur Rós as we knew them. After the breakup rumors subsided, the band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46576-sigur-ros-kjarten-sveinsson-to-sit-out-world-tour/"" target=""_blank"">lost keyboardist <span>Kjartan Sveinsson</span></a> and signed with a new label. Returning with unexpected speed and unprecedented vitality, <i>Kveikur</i><i> </i>is the big payback; a bracing record of pummeling post-rock, eerie hauntology and concentrated pop splendor, Sigur Rós finally acknowledge their impact by beating all of their acolytes at their own game.</p>
<p>That <i>Kveikur </i>translates to “candlewick” and phonetically sounds like “quake” is appropriate, as Sigur Rós’ seventh album is their most explosive and action-packed. Perhaps it’s to compensate for the departure of Sveinsson, or maybe bassist Georg Holm and drummer Orri Páll Dýrason are just tired of getting 0% of the credit over the past decade and a half. Either way, <i>Kveikur </i>is defined by its rhythm section, even as it wisely repositions <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28494-jonsi/"" target=""_blank"">Jónsi</a>'s inimitable vocals as the focus, back where they belong after being used as mostly texture on <i>Valtari</i>.</p>
<p>After the ambient bubble bath of <i>Valtari, </i>the deep drum hits within the first minute of “Brennisteinn” disrupt Sigur Rós’ artistic stasis like a cannonball; the heavy metal churn takes on a metaphorical and symbolic aspect, as if signifying Sigur Rós’ transformation from an inanimate object into a vengeful, destructive Decepticon. From there on out, Sigur Rós are fully committed to stress testing their sound. Whenever the distorted bass lunges on the title track, it sounds like it’s trying to drill oil from the ocean floor. The feedback shrieks throughout “Brennisteinn"" feel elegant and sleek rather than abrasive, like fine cutlery on black marble instead of nails on a chalkboard. “Hrafntinna” is a metal song in a literal sense, composed of fractured cymbals, sonorous brass, the whinny of horsehair on steel guitar strings; over its six minutes, there’s a filmic, storytelling quality that shows Jónsi could and should be doing soundtrack work for movies with more heft than <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16104-we-bought-a-zoo"">We Bought A Zoo</a>.</i></p>
<p>But Sigur Rós always had the frame for heavy metal muscle-- let’s not forget this is a band who makes 10-minute songs with elfin vocals from a guy who wears a fringed jacket and plays his guitar with a cello bow. For all their ethereal beauty, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7151-agaetis-byrjun/"" target=""_blank""><i>Agaetis Byrjun </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7152-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank""><i>( ) </i></a>are <i>heavy </i>records. This isn’t Sigur Rós all of a sudden donning Viking helmets and playing out dry-ice fantasies like Robert Plant in <i>The Song Remains the Same-- </i>Think of it along the lines of Boards of Canada’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18104-boards-of-canada-tomorrows-harvest""><i>Tomorrow’s Harvest </i></a>or Portishead’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11438-third"">Third</a> </i>without the attendant hype-stoking hiatus, reacting to the impossible standards set by their groundbreaking early work (as well as a reputation for being chillout fare), by exposing their gnarled roots and demonic impulses. </p>
<p>For example, what if the distended howl of <i>Agaetis Byrjun </i>was distilled into the percussive clatter of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7155-takk/""><i>Takk</i></a>’s “Gong” and concentrated shoegaze swirl of “<span>Með blóðnasir</span>”? It might produce something like “Ísjaki"", where Dýrason's drums continuously push Jónsi’s call and response vocals to new ecstatic spaces between disco pleasure and black metal pain. Combine the electronic-pop momentum of Jónsi’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14098-go/"" target=""_blank""><i>Go </i></a>with the imperial marches of <i>Með suð</i> of<i> </i>and the result is the “Rafstraumur"", a reminder that Sigur Rós can still go goosebump-for-goosebump with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"" target=""_blank"">Coldplay</a> if they so choose.</p>
<p>It’s one thing for a complete sonic overhaul to be necessary, but what stands out about <i>Kveikur </i>is how natural it feels. As opposed to a rebranding, this is Sigur Rós internally reconstituted, where the biggest addition isn’t distorted guitars or huge drums or Jónsi going full tilt. More than sounds, this is an integration of new verbs and actions, as Sigur Rós pummel, rage, wail and assert, asking hard questions of themselves. What if they could harness their power to convey immediate anger instead of patient catharsis, as a soundtrack for lifting weights instead of zoning out? Jónsi’s vocals will always bear an extraterrestrial shimmer, but why can’t he play the avenging archangel rather than a friendly ghost? After 15 years of evoking Iceland's gorgeous, volcanic terrain and woodsprite legends, why not reflect the endless winters, cratered economy and the frightening suicide rate?</p>
<p>Even if it doesn’t have the same cultivated mystery or incapacitating demands of <i>Agaetis Byrjun </i>or <i>( ), Kveikur </i>is every bit a return to form, tapping into its predecessors’ bottomless emotional wellspring for a Sigur Rós album that can be listened to casually or intensely, a collection that works as effectively as a spiritual experience and pop music, the essence of their overwhelming, widescreen grandeur conveyed with the immediacy of a 50-minute rock record.</p></div>"|18191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18191-sigur-ros-kveikur/|8.1|Ian Cohen

But more just than hip a new generation to this eternally enigmatic, eminently influential band (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17966-deerhunter-monomania/"" target=""_blank""><i>Monomania</i></a> being just the last album to mainline their scuzz-rock steez), the fat-free reissues speak to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1871-neil-michael-hagerty/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Hagerty</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9561-jennifer-herrema/"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Heremma</a>’s treatment of the album as a self-contained, vacuum-sealed unit, each with its own distinct themes, theoretical approaches, sonic signatures, and supporting casts of players.</p>
<p>This rationale even extends to the latest-- and briefest-- entry in the campaign, <i>3-Song EP</i>, which initially appeared just four months after their 1998 knockout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17243-accelerator/"" target=""_blank""><i>Accelerator</i></a>, and seemingly could’ve been tacked onto the recent re-release of that album. But to do so would’ve been to undermine another crucial turning point in the band’s labyrinthine course. Where <i>Accelerator</i> purposely compacted its arena-rock riffage into trash-canned dimensions and called attention to its production chicanery, <i>3-Song EP</i> saw the Trux gearing up for its fall ’98 European tour, recruiting Drag City mascot Rian Murphy, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"" target=""_blank"">Slint</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"" target=""_blank"">Tortoise</a> guitar master David Pajo, and future <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2686-the-mars-volta/"" target=""_blank"">Mars Volta</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"" target=""_blank"">Queens of the Stone Age</a> drummer Jon Theodore to thicken up the band’s sound by several inches. Where <i>Accelerator</i> tweaked the treble and distortion to equilibrium-imbalancing extremes, <i>3-Song EP</i> emphasizes the Trux’s mastery of rhythm, groove, and freak flag-flying jams.</p>
<p>As self-explanatory as it seems, the <i>3-Song EP</i> name is a bit of an understatement-- it’s actually two songs sandwiching the most epic, colossally awesome piece of music the Trux ever attempted. In the former camp lies “Deafer Than Blind"", a blissfully woozy Hagerty/Heremma duet that shares the same heady quality as the band’s exquisite 1993 single “Back to School”. (Though Hagerty’s spoken-word freestyle toward the end ultimately disrupts the reverie.) Its bookend counterpart, “Run, Shaker Life” is an amped-up, acid-rockin’ cover of an old Richie Havens folk-funk raga-- capped by a searing solo from Hagerty-- that, in light of the Woodstock legend’s recent passing, stands as an especially timely and fitting tribute to his fiery spirit. And in between lies the incomparable “United States vs. One 1974 Cadillac El Dorado Sedan"", whose title provides a pretty good indication of the band's internal struggle between grandiose ambition and absurdist logic. It’s Royal Trux’s entire arsenal of avant-rock contradictions squaring off in a seven-minute battle royale: Heremma’s hoarse-throat psycho-babble vs. Hagerty’s plainspoken streetwise spiel (which includes arguably the first ever reference in song to the ""threat of the internet"")<b></b>, Zeppelin-grade blooze riffage vs. ear-piercing synth frequencies, lighter-waving chorus hooks vs. nonsensical lyrics (“You’re living in the fabled land of Nod!”), steady in-the-pocket basslines vs. destabilizing, multi-tracked vocal miasma. Royal Trux would go on to title their next album <i>Veterans of Disorder</i>; with this track alone, they earned a sleeve’s worth of stripes. </p></div>"|18194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18194-royal-trux-3-song-ep/|8.0|Stuart Berman

With the general perception of the city's decay (and its ""halftime in America"" stereotype), anything ""angry"" in a song could quickly and cheaply be attributed to the artist's surroundings. Maybe that's partially due to some long-held MC5- or Ted Nugent-based aggression archetype. On some records, though, Detroit's presence is pretty well spelled out. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6917-tyvek/"">Tyvek</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17411-on-triple-beams/"">last one</a>, for example, had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14554-wayne-county-roads/"">""Wayne County Roads""</a>. Similarly, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/protomartyr"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Protomartyr</a> don't hide their hometown on <i>No Passion All Technique</i>, their debut album. There's ""Jumbo's"", which is about the <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/jumbos-bar-detroit-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bar in Midtown</a>, and ""Ypsilanti"", a <a href=""http://www.cityofypsilanti.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">city</a> 40 minutes away. On their debut album, they tell stories set in these places (and others), and back them with a diverse rock'n'roll ecosystem.</p>
<p>""Machinist Man"" is the story of a night foreman who works all week in the city. Come the weekend, he's drinking High Life after High Life. But then, Protomartyr counterbalance the foreman's story with this sentence: ""There are things that are built in the skulls of men."" And that line, bellowed in Joe Casey's baritone, embodies why <i>No Passion All Technique</i> isn't just ""an album about Detroit"". It's set in Detroit, its characters live in and around Detroit, but this album is bigger than one place. Protomartyr's characters are more than hollow archetypes or faceless B-roll factory workers from <i>Searching for Sugar</i> <i>Man</i>. These are people with ideas, struggles, and stories. The three schizophrenic gentlemen detailed in ""Ypsilanti"", for example: One of them throws books out windows, one of them ""could still punch through walls,"" and the third delivers an enigmatic monologue: ""Call me not interference, my name is I.R. Dung. If I see my hands, sir, I know they do no wrong.""</p>
<p>These are stories delivered with an alarming amount of sonic dexterity. While ""Hot Wheel City"" has the anthemic rafter reach of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"" target=""_blank"">Hold Steady</a> track, ""Free Supper"" is pure speed punk. ""Jumbo's"" falls into a droning, hypnotic psych melody, and though it stays on a specific course, it keeps gradually fluctuating in volume, suddenly adding layers of instruments and suddenly stripping them away. Then there's something like ""Three Swallows""-- paced, fingerpicked, warm. There, the band quietly ruminates on drinking-- a topic <i>All Passion No Technique </i>picks up a few times-- plus loss, aging, and heartbreak. It's a devastating and human track, and the song doesn't settle for sonic or tonal simplicity. Midway through, it gets a set of loud and chunky acid-washed guitars. After about two minutes, it's over way too soon.</p>
<p>Scouring the lyrics sheet for <i>No Passion All Technique</i>, you'll find cold detachment and cynicism all over the place. ""Jumbo's"" opens with the rigidly delivered line, ""I will touch the screen no more/ I will not have a drink."" But this album is never bitter, and it's never a slog. A song like ""Feral Cats"" even borders on absurdity. Frantic instrumentals accompany Casey's vocals, which are paranoid about dust, nurses, and warfare. Then, with a big triumphant hook and a shouted vocal, they sing, ""Just like feral cats!"" Is this a joke? Is this legitimate concern, like how we should probably honest-to-god fear feral pigs? It's a song delivered with either gravity or a smirk, and either way, it's a great song.</p>
<p>What's refreshing about <i>No Passion All Technique </i>is its lack of immediate sonic reference points. There are loose ones-- vocals like Nick Cave, punk guitars-- but this is a record in its own universe. There's jittery instrumentals, cynicism, and paranoia, sure, but you can't define it by those things. There's also heartwrenching loss and awesome guitar solos.

What made the project stand out was that its subterfuge wasn't some overcompressed YouTube dump but a finely tailored media project with an elegant (and slightly racy) <a href=""http://www.gettingcloser.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, intriguing track snippets, and remixes of name artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23840-scuba/"" target=""_blank"">Scuba</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8133-little-dragon/"" target=""_blank"">Little Dragon</a>. Whoever was behind Close had resources and friends. Saul's name-- he announced himself the progenitor of Close last October-- doesn't smell of a proper big reveal, but the label boss behind <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/Simple+Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Simple Records</a> and, more recently, <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/Aus+Music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aus Music</a>, has helped spearhead the underground house music revival in the UK.</p>
<p><i>Getting Closer</i>, for the savvy !K7 label, is the product of all the intrigue. It's a definitive and self-assured move away from the dance floor toward lustrous, house-leaning pop structures. The real surprise is the tempos. Some dance music gets labeled otherwise simply because it's meant for non-club environments-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">the Field</a> is a good example-- but <i>Getting Closer</i>'s ten tracks are almost uniformly slow and lush, unfolding calmly and ending tidily. The goal, <a href=""http://www.teshno.com/2013/05/interview-close.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saul says</a>, was to make an album, rather than a collection of tracks; something requiring repeat listens, something that would last.<br/><br/>For about 50 minutes, <i>Getting Closer</i> cordons off a world of spitshined chords, luxe texture, and amorous bass. It's pop music, but only just so, like a house version of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"" target=""_blank"">Massive Attack</a> record: a host of collaborators, some studio trickery, lots of downtempo groping. And grope it does. While <i>Getting Closer</i> doesn't play like a dance record, it doesn't play much like any other kind of record either, vacillating wildly between spacey lounge (""I Died 1000 Times""), synth-funk (""Cubizm""), pitch-black dub (""Born in a Rolling Barrel""), and a half-dozen other variants. Some of these can be awkward fits: the beatific balladry of ""Wallflower"", featuring vocalist Fink, is too severe and self-impressed. The nadir is ""Future Love"", a feckless pilfering of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>'s dark steam.</p>
<p>All of which is too bad, because <i>Getting Closer</i> sounds marvelous. It's clearly a work that meant a lot to its creator, sounding fussed over and lovingly polished. The clarity and separation Saul brings to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15403-my-way-ft-joe-dukie/"" target=""_blank"">""My Way""</a> (presented here as a remix by Tanner Ross and Slow Hands), a tip-toeing ballad featuring Joe Dukie, is rare, as is the bluish synthesizer smoke that he lets ribbon from the song's cracked window. The only upbeat track is lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15250-beam-me-up-ft-charlene-soraia-and-scuba-george-fitzgerald-remix/"" target=""_blank"">""Beam Me Up""</a>, which features Scuba and Charlene Soraia, an astral-pop burner that builds evenly until its chorus rockets upward. <i>Getting Closer</i> could use more of ""Beam""'s vigor, but the some of the instrumental tracks-- the floral unfolding of ""OSCAR"" and the bustling ""Time Fades"" add worthy texture. The highly styled ""I Died""-- also featuring Soraia-- is magnetic. Her voice cuts through Saul's manicured future pop nicely.</p>
<p>Saul's productions under his own name have always been pleasant but nondescript. <i>Getting Closer</i> represents a step forward for him because it feels like an album that has carved out its own little place in the world. Some of that may be the pre-release marketing, to be sure, but <i>Getting Closer</i>'s clean lines and airtight style hold together a collection of disparate styles. <i>Getting Closer</i> is fashionable and curious, but there's an extreme lucidity to it that is off-putting, forgetting for a moment a handful of dud tracks. It's too forward in its attempts at pop, there's no deception. Saul made an album, true to his goal, but <i>Getting Closer</i> begs for observation, not immersion.</p></div>"|18187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18187-close-getting-closer/|6.3|Andrew Gaerig

By 2011, dubstep's ascent to global notoriety was well underway: the U.S. was feeling the first ripples of Skrillex fever, while the U.K. had already seen chart success from <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29414-katy-b/"" target=""_blank"">Katy B</a> and Magnetic Man. By this point Anglo-Czech singer-producer Ema Jolly had been engaged with the genre for some time, having discovered it while living in Bristol as a teenager. Her music showed it: In contrast to the pyrotechnics of mainstream dubstep, hers was a poppier take on the style that drew on the stringent, sub-heavy minimalism of early DMZ for inspiration.</p>
<p>There was more to Jolly's music than<i> </i>dubstep, though. After her spell in Bristol she moved to Berlin, and fell in love with techno. She quickly became embedded in the scene centering around the legendary Berghain club and its label, Ostgut Ton; in 2010, field recordings she had taken in the club formed the basis for the label's landmark <i>Fünf </i>compilation. Jolly's debut album unified these influences-- the yawning negative space of dubstep, Berlin techno's dank hypnotism, and the intricate sound design she had learned at university and put into practice working for Native Instruments-- in the service of a downcast, nocturnal brand of pop. Jolly's sepulchral vocal was a central presence but not an imposing one, preferring to lurk in the shadows cast by her brooding synthetic arrangements.</p>
<p>Come 2013, dubstep has well and truly jumped the shark, and it no longer seems like a useful lens through which to scrutinize Emika's music. Sure, <i>Dva</i>,<i> </i>her second album, tips its fair share of nods to the dance forms that inspired her-- ""Sleep With My Enemies"" sports the razor-edged bass and 140bpm rhythmic chassis of dubstep, and ""Mouth to Mouth"", one of the record's highlights, draws on techno's slow-burn dynamics. But Jolly's vocal is more prominent than ever, and for the most part song-form takes precedent over dancefloor structures. <i>Dva </i>is better viewed simply as an underground pop record-- and as pop records go, it makes a pretty bold entrance. Opening track ""Hush (Interlude)"" sets the electronics to one side, enlisting classical soprano Michaela Šrůmová and a 28-piece string orchestra. The result-- a decent enough pastiche of lachrymal European romanticism-- suggests that Jolly's ambitions have reached grandiose new heights.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that impression is short-lived. From there, <i>Dva</i> becomes naggingly familiar: jagged, sub-heavy bass lines and metallic percussion give way to slightly plasticky synths and unadventurous drum work, suggesting that Jolly has toned down the sonic experimentation found on her debut, perhaps by way of foregrounding her songs' pop potential. It represents only a mild progression from the themes and sonics of <i>Emika</i>, and while there are occasional hooky pop moments to equal that album's finest, those songs rarely stray beyond the limits set by their predecessors. ""Filters"", with its louche shuffle, and the aqueous piano-led balladry of ""Primary Colours"" leap out. But otherwise, Jolly's limited sonic toolbox and obsession with dirgy minor-key tonalities soon begin to wear dangerously thin.</p>
<p>All of this could be forgiven, perhaps, if Jolly herself was a commanding vocal presence. Unfortunately that's not the case: pushed further into the foreground, the awkwardness and flat melisma of her feather-light delivery become painfully apparent. It's difficult to think of a more apt example of how Jolly fails to inhabit the grandiose architecture she has constructed for herself than on ""Dem Worlds"". Here the string orchestra returns, but Jolly's vocal is dwarfed by its towering, full-bodied chords, her contribution sounding more like an extraneous doodle than the product of the ""rebel diva"" she has <a href=""http://ninjatune.net/article/2013/jun/10/emika-dva-out-now-and-new-inch-centuries-inch-video"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">claimed</a> to be. In <i>Dva</i>,<i> </i>Emika may be aspiring to a larger scale of pop, but for the most part this only serves to amplify her flaws.</p></div>"|18193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18193-emika-dva/|5.9|Angus Finlayson

It sees the Southend group all but shed any assocations they once had with the wider rock world, reinventing themselves as a neo-classical ensemble. The result is an uncompromisingly self-possessed record whose intimate qualities shouldn't be mistaken for an easy listen-- in many respects, its clearest analog is <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Talk Talk</a>’s <i>Spirit of Eden. </i>It opens with a Portuguese jazz vocalist, Elisa Rodrigues, singing a sparkling, barely half-remembered version of Herb Alpert’s “This Guy’s in Love With You”. As it ends, Adrian Peacock, who has the lowest known singing voice in Britain, unleashes an apparently bottomless vocal drone, sounding as if he’s humming along to a Sunn O))) song, while Barnett chants in phonetics like a tricksy goblin.</p>
<p>Despite releasing three markedly different albums over the past five years, the Puritans have earned the trust of their audience, allowing them to go wherever their iconoclastic spirit takes them. Their debut album, 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11295-beat-pyramid/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beat Pyramid</i></a>, took the moony British post-punk phenomenon of the preceding few years and made it <i>nasty</i>, agitated, and wholly uninterested in emotive melancholy or accessible lyrical subjects. Numerology and olde magick were central, though good luck trying to prise much else from it. “You know I’ll be thinking this music’s symbolic/ This music is weightless, and when I sing, so am I/ You’ll be slashing at the air, describing nothing,” Barnett sang with deterrent glee on “Swords of Truth”. He's been equally oblique describing <i>Field of Reeds</i>. “I’m just putting one sound in front of the other and thinking about what comes next,” he <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/may/30/these-new-puritans-record-hawk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> the<i> Guardian.</i></p>
<p>Its follow-up, 2010’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13951-hidden/"" target=""_blank"">Hidden</a>, </i>sounded like a strikingly, elegantly choreographed war, at once global and gothic with its destructive beats, mournful laments, and taunting vocals. And now, <i>Field of Reeds</i> is a stilled, abstract pastoral of sorts, where the music seems to grow and swarm as naturally as moss across rocks. Its closest modern peer might be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"" target=""_blank"">Julia Holter</a>'s equally pristine <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16352-ekstasis/"" target=""_blank"">Ekstasis</a>. </i>Where <i>Hidden</i> traded in damning impact, <i>Field of Reeds</i> uses Barnett’s self-taught compositional prowess-- and the borrowed skills of composers André de Ridder, Michel van der Aa, and Hans Ek-- to explore the effects of memory, requiring investment on the listener's part, too; “Spiral” seems to repeat a clarinet motif from <i>Hidden</i>; “Organ Eternal” rekindles the glassy pulse of “V (Island Song)” with the resonator piano, a riff that in turn strongly recalls “Tubular Bells”.</p>
<p><i>Field of Reeds</i> was recorded over 12 months in three different studios. The drums were added around structures determined by the strings, horns, and magnetic resonator piano-- a haunted, silvery-sounding creation-- and barely appear at all in the album’s final third (Barnett has suggested there are three movements here). Somehow, the effect is more intimidating than the parts on <i>Hidden</i> where they smashed melons to simulate crushing a skull. The spareness and sense of space on <i>Field of Reeds</i> is remarkable, the kind that'll make you glance over your shoulder as beguiling mercury-slicked glows slip into an overwhelming, sometimes vicious sense of anxiety; ""There is something there,"" as Barnett sings on ""Fragment Two"".</p>
<p>These shifts are made even more unsettling by the lack of aggression in the playing; where <i>Hidden</i>’s M.O. could be found in “Attack Music”, on <i>Field of Reeds</i> there’s the sense that these glowing clarinets and strings are occurring naturally, almost as if emanating from a landscape. Gone too is the obtuse vocal phrasing that ran through <i>Beat Pyramid</i> and <i>Hidden</i>; Barnett has talked about spending “hours going through each sentence of the lyrics getting rid of all the consonants,” a defamiliarizing effect that makes his lines as slippery and memory-foxing as the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uLpRvERjLE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dream-speak in “Twin Peaks”</a>. It's as upsetting too; <i>Field of Reeds</i>' quiet lyrical narrative seems to follow a period of loss; first a person, and subsequently, trust in any kind of concrete meaning, underpinned by the way lines disintegrate into phonetic babble. As his fastidious techniques show, Barnett is a total perfectionist-- he proudly made George play 76 drum takes on one song-- yet his control freakiness hasn’t killed the record; the effect is naturalistic, and often deeply moving, rather than in any way inert.</p>
<p>While <i>Field of Reeds</i> is a mysterious album in many ways, what it makes clear is Barnett’s faith in the purity of sound, rather than words, to communicate; remember, ""This music is weightless, and when I sing, so am I."" By removing any imposition of context, his words of consonants, his music of attention-grabbing impact, his ensemble of rock band-status, he’s created a truly strange and beautiful record. Whether Barnett makes it explicit or not, These New Puritans’ songs have always been concerned with their South-Easterly corner of the coast, the smoggy bowel of London where <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunsell_Forts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rusting World War II fortifications</a> stand demilitarized among the islands, just like the sounds on this album. “Secret recordings were made in the marsh,” Barnett chanted on <i>Hidden</i>’s “We Want War”. It feels as though he finally trusts us to hear them on <i>Field of Reeds</i>.</p></div>"|18103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18103-these-new-puritans-field-of-reeds/|8.4|Laura Snapes

The British producer's debut, 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14732-lucky-shiner/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lucky Shiner</i></a>, was an emotive tapestry of personal history, with textures that evoked imagery with a distinct personal glow. On his second album and first substantial release in three years, <i>Half of Where You Live</i>, Gold Panda shifts the focus from who he is to where he's been.</p>
<p>This shift makes sense. The success he's enjoyed has sent him far from the suburban Essex enclave he once called home. <i>Lucky Shiner</i> cuts like ""India Lately"" and ""Same Dream China"" swirled the culturally distinctive sounds of plucked strings and tangled sitar detritus into their respective mixes. 2009's <i>Miyamae</i> EP took its name from a ward of the Japanese city of Kawasaki; its bookended cuts were named, respectively, ""Back Home"" and ""Long Vacation"". Clearly, the act of leaving is far more intriguing to him than returning.</p>
<p>A quick scan of <i>Half of Where You Live</i>'s tracklist uncovers more name-checked locales-- Brazil, Hong Kong, the Japanese island of Enoshima, the British town of Flinton-- but above all else, Gold Panda's current residence of Berlin looms large. Whereas <i>Lucky Shiner</i> had a bright, nostalgic glow, <i>Half of Where You Live</i> is distinctly darker and, at points, clubbier than its predecessor. The glimmering synths and hazy, chiming techno featured on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15555-james-holden/"" target=""_blank"">James Holden</a>'s Border Community label are reference points here, alongside shimmering vignettes that call back to the pretty-sounding IDM that German imprint Morr Music was known for in the early 2000s.</p>
<p><i>Half of Where You Live</i> doesn't mark the first time Gold Panda's flirted with more distinctly dancey fare, but it's he's never been this successful with it. For all its winsome elegance, there were moments on <i>Lucky Shiner</i> that, for better or worse, sounded truly handmade to the point that you could practically hear Gold Panda's fingers mashing hia Akai MPC. The MPC is still present here-- the gurgling ""S950"" takes its name from a specific model of the sampling equipment-- but these tracks sound smoother and more refined, a logical progression from the staticky amniotic techno that made up this year's brief stopgap EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17701-gold-panda-trust-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Trust</i></a>.</p>
<p>Gold Panda's long been someone who works very well in miniature form; his talent for pushing repetition to the brink of its greatest, most pleasurable effect is documented by the attention-grabbing success of early singles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11415-quitters-raga/"" target=""_blank"">""Quitter's Raga""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11877-you/"" target=""_blank"">""You""</a>. But his ability to expand his vision to fit longer forms is his secret weapon. The nearly psychedelic sprawl of ""India Lately"" already suggested as much, and on <i>Half of Where You Live</i>, Gold Panda delivers his most potent side-stretcher in the form of ""Brazil"". The six-minute track is the closest thing this album comes to in terms of anthems, as a hollow bassline and a male voice repeating the titular city's name build the backbone. A mess of chimes come crashing in, the beat drops, and then picks up again with a tangy, winding synth line that makes for a seismic, satisfying addition. </p>
<p>""Brazil"" is <i>Half of Where You Live</i>'s big highlight, and the subtlety of its charms extend to the record as a whole. The winsome, direct melodies that marked <i>Lucky Shiner</i>'s high points are largely absent here, which may cause some to consider the album a slight disappointment. That's understandable, but ultimately the success of <i>Half of Where You Live </i>lies not in Gold Panda repeating old tricks, but in how he's expanded his repertoire to include new sounds, and his aesthetic proves sturdy enough to accomdate them. </p></div>"|18121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18121-gold-panda-half-of-where-you-live/|7.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

Slint's second album, <i>Spiderland</i>, was released in 1991, and was almost immediately spoken about in hushed tones. It's rare to see an instant classic, but <i>Spiderland</i> was (deservedly) just that.</p>
<p>Rodan were a younger band taking cues from Slint, but going in a different direction. Not as many people knew about them; some that did discounted them as Slint Jr. During this period, <i>Nevermind</i> and Seattle ruled the popular conscious, but for a number of people, Louisville, Kentucky, was more important. There was Slint, of course, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"" target=""_blank"">Will Oldham</a>, the guy who took the photo on the <a href=""http://quietus_production.s3.amazonaws.com/images/articles/6168/spiderland_1303926063_crop_550x550.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> of <i>Spiderland</i>. There was also associated acts, Squirrel Bait and Bastro, as well as Antietam.</p>
<p>More than any of these bands, Rodan felt like <i>our</i> Louisville band. You knew members of Rodan lived together in a place in Louisville called the Rocket House, and you wanted to go there. I remember 60 or so people packing into a tiny art gallery in Manhattan to watch <i><i>Half-Cocked</i></i>, a road movie by Sleepyhead bassist Michael Galinsky and his partner Suki Hawley that starred Rodan and featured cameos from members of Unwound, Helium, Polvo, Freakwater, the Grifters, Versus, Slant 6, and others. It felt like a major cultural moment to everyone in that room, the way I imagine people feel now when their favorite DIY band ends up on ""Fallon"".</p>
<p>Rodan was formed in 1992 by guitarist/vocalists Jason Noble and Jeff Mueller. They released their brilliant Bob ""Rusty"" Weston-produced debut, <i>Rusty</i>, in 1994 on Touch &amp; Go subsidiary Quarterstick. There were compilation appearances and 7""'s, then they went on to other things. After they called it quits in 1994, Mueller went on to found <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2217-june-of-44/"" target=""_blank"">June of 44</a>, Noble the classically minded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3506-rachels/"" target=""_blank"">Rachel's</a>. Bassist/guitarist/vocalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3158-tara-jane-oneil/"" target=""_blank"">Tara Jane O'Neil</a> formed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3565-retsin/"" target=""_blank"">Retsin</a> with Cynthia of Ruby Falls. Drummer Kevin Coultas played in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/802-come/"" target=""_blank"">Come</a> and later joined O'Neill in the Sonora Pine. Mueller and Noble eventually got back together in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3770-shipping-news/"" target=""_blank"">the Shipping News</a>. These movements felt natural, connected.</p>
<p>Now, almost 20 years after Rodan said goodbye, we get <i>Fifteen Quiet Years</i>, a compilation initally organized in 2009 that includes the band's long out-of -print 7""'s and compilation tracks, as well as their 1994 three-song BBC session for John Peel. It's not sequential, though it does open with the blown-out, but pensive and relatively poppy instrumental ""Darjeeling"" that served as their recorded debut. That song appeared, in 1993, on a four-band 7"" put out by Jenny Toomey and Kristin Thomson on their Va. label, Simple Machines. (The 7"" also included Superchunk, Unrest, and Simple Machines houseband, Tsunami. Rodan were, again, the young guns.) On <i>Fifteen</i>, it's followed by the heavier and more spacious ""Milk and Melancholy"", a hardcore-indebted song from their early self-released <i>Aviary</i> demo that was reworked for the 1993 <i>How Winter Was Passed</i> single, put out by Three Little Girls (the same goes for ""Exoskeleton"", another song that appears here). You also get the scuzzy later take on <i>Aviary</i>'s ""Tron"" that appeared on the <i>Half-Cocked</i> soundtrack.</p>
<p>The most interesting material on <i>Fifteen</i> is the stuff that appeared on <i>Aviary</i>, and then showed up in beefier form on <i>Rusty</i>. See, for instance, the blitzkrieg blast of ""Shiner"", which still sounds like it was composed in a blender. The version here is from the <i>Compulsiv for Two</i> 7"". There's also the 1992 version of the whirling, knotty <i>Rusty</i> closer, ""Tooth Fairy Retribution Manifesto"", which features the light, calm vocals of O'Neill over a time-shifting backdrop that moves between heavy sludge and airier passages; it continually rebuilds and recoils, one of those songs that could go on for another 10 minutes and still have you by the neck. These first six songs on <i>Fifteen</i> are out-of-print material. They're followed by the previously unreleased BBC Peel Session, which features ""Sangre"", ""Big Things, Small Things"", and ""Before the Train"": O'Neill sings the almost balladic ""Sangre"" (of course, it explodes, comes back together, explodes again); the swinging ""Big, Things, Small Things will help you tease out the Slint comparisons; the 11-minute ""Before the Train"" feels like a roller coaster.</p>
<p>As a physical object,<i> Fifteen Quiet Years</i> is a lesson in what DIY was (and is). The packaging was designed by Noble and Mueller in 2009, and was letterpress-printed by Mueller at his Dexterity Press studio. The tracks were remastered that same year by Weston, Mueller, and Noble at Chicago Mastering. And the album comes with a code to download 10 additional live recordings, selected by Noble, Mueller, O'Neil, and Coultas. These include takes on a number of  Rodan staples at places like the Black Cat in D.C., Thunderdome in Louisville, and Lounge Ax in Chicago. (You get lives versions of most songs on <i>Fifteen</i>, as well as two takes on ""Wurl"".)</p>
<p>Of course, even with those extras, <i>Fifteen</i> is an incomplete offering. If you pair it with <i>Rusty</i>, though, you get a good picture of the band. While you're at it, you should also read the old-school liner notes, complete with a ""thank you"" section that reads like a who's who of 90s underground rock. (Back in the day, this was how you discovered new music.) Also seek out live footage and <i>Half-Cocked</i>, which is now available on DVD, and you'll see why so many people thought Rodan were so special.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since then. This music still sounds raw, like it always did, but it's accrued something darker: Noble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47386-rip-jason-noble-of-rodan-rachels-shipping-news/"" target=""_blank"">died of cancer</a> in 2012, original drummer Jon Cook, also of Crain, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49506-rip-jon-cook-of-rodan-crain-cerebellum/"" target=""_blank"">passed away this year</a>. Though <i>Fifteen</i> doesn't bring them back, it's good to know that the music they helped create will again be part of the conversation.

It's nostalgic, but with the reflection seen through a funhouse mirror. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30523-foxygen/"" target=""_blank"">Foxygen</a>, and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/28890-unknown-mortal-orchestra/"" target=""_blank"">Unknown Mortal Orchestra</a> before them, Wampire's emergence seems to have benefitted from the trail blazed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14122-congratulations/"" target=""_blank"">Congratulations</a></i>. Although the Brooklyn band’s second album may have been deemed a disappointment by major label standards, in retrospect, its glam-smeared, hyper-frazzled psych pop anticipated alt-rock’s subsequent turn towards the strange.</p>
<p>Recorded by UMO bassist Jacob Portrait, <i>Curiosity</i> doesn’t shy away from its retro allusions, from the bizarro-world Sears-family-portrait cover art to the dust-covered production, which approximates the fidelity of an overly over-dubbed cassette. Wampire first formed in 2007 as a beat-driven electronic project to soundtrack Portland house parties; that it’s taken the core members, Eric Phipps and Rocky Tinder, six years to issue a proper debut album hints at both the elastic, evolutionary qualities of their sound and a patient approach to organzing the album's seemingly random elements. While the surface haziness lends <i>Curiosity</i> a sloppy, off-the-cuff appearance, it’s very much by design.</p>
<p>Wampire’s attention to craft is immediately apparent in lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14773-the-hearse/"" target=""_blank"">“The Hearse”</a>, which opens the album with a blissful blur of synth-powered dream-pop. Suddenly, they drop the beat and dissolve into an eerie organ drone that’s used as the foundation for the song’s heart-racing, motorik climax. But if “The Hearse” packs an impressive amount of drama and dynamic range into its four-and-a-half minutes, much of <i>Curiosity</i> finds Wampire a bit too comfortable and self-satisfied within their washed-out aesthetic, and the premeditated haziness of the recordings-- and obvious attempts to weird them up, through squeaky synth settings and effete vocal tics-- ultimately undermines the duo’s songwriting ambitions.</p>
<p>“Giants” is the busiest of all-- comprising a rumbling surf-punk riff, waves of wah-wah-ed guitars, haunted-house organs, a bop-along Beach Boys-via-Panda Bear melody, a melancholic mid-song breakdown-- but the metronomic rhythm and compressed dimensions sap the song of its delirious potential, plotting all the action on a straight line. And though the anxious energy underpinning Phipps’ and Tinder’s vocals is palpable throughout, whenever they get too close to opening up emotionally, they resort to affectation: The sad-eyed sentiments of “Outta Money” are communicated through a comically droopy warble, while <i>Curiosity</i>’s most resonant song, “Trains”, could practically pass for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3bUg8wsgVE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vintage Jackson Browne</a>, if not for a self-consciously cheeky delivery that diminishes the romantic longing expressed within. Since their inauspicious, experimental beginnings, Wampire have obviously matured greatly as songwriters; now, they just need to channel that same confidence and daring into the execution.</p></div>"|18141.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18141-wampire-curiosity/|6.0|Stuart Berman

While he never references specific geography, the pervasive attitude in his music is one where the economy is down, the humidity is up, and everything moves a little too slowly as a result. Though Cothran moved from Spartanburg to the relatively metro capital of Columbia and recorded <i>Posthumous Release </i>in Los Angeles, it’s just a cleaner and clearer evocation of the same feeling that coursed through his earlier work: this isn’t the depression borne of unmet expectations and missed opportunities, it’s the deflation of boredom, of <i>no </i>opportunities. There is great art to be had in this quiet desperation, where a creative mind thinks anything can happen but his circumstances dictate that it rarely does. While <i>Posthumous Release </i>nails that feeling, it doesn’t always translate as compelling pop music.</p>
<p>Though Cothran finds the minute differences between a sigh, a shrug, and a sulk throughout <i>Posthumous Release, </i>the album never drags. These songs are minimal in every aspect-- Cothran’s flat, sullen voice at the forefront of arrangements that are even mousier, sparse acoustic strums and brushed snares often parceled out in increments of two minutes or less. The quick cuts lend <i>Posthumous Release</i> a sense of immediacy that the underlying components can’t muster, giving the impression that their brevity is necessary to capture the moment rather than a result of rushed songwriting.</p>
<p>Rather than compensating for the spare music, Cothran uses lyrics every bit as economically, which denies <i>Posthumous Release </i>much sense of release. There are a couple of dagger lyrics throughout that punctuate the record’s themes of failure, codependence, and despondence. But what <i>Posthumous Release</i> lacks is exposition, detail, or a sense of stakes in the matter. A line like ""cut myself at work"" implies a blue-collar gig where physical injury is a risk, but ""She Keeps it Alive"" leaves too much to the imagination; the same goes for the evocatively titled ""Lee (Columbine High Harmony)"", where Cothran admits, ""My wrists somehow forgot/ That quiet parking lot,"" and just lets it hang.</p>
<p>The most striking parts of <i>Posthumous Release </i>recall the inventiveness of 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15458-blue-suicide/"" target=""_blank"">Blue Suicide</a>, </i>an album where you sensed a prolific artist straining against limitations of both budget and production know-how. “Satan Made a Mansion” shows Cothran’s knack for snappy alt-rock hooks while the wigged-out flange effects of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15508-coma-cinema-burn-a-church/"" target=""_blank"">“Burn a Church”</a> exaggerate the vocal manipulation of “Her Sinking Sun”, thus far his strongest tune. Otherwise, the limitations of <i>Posthumous Release </i>are set into the foundation of its songs, many built upon two chords or revolving around a single, repeated line rather than a chorus. At best, they recall the throwback solo performances that would cut through the orchestral clutter on later <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a> albums, though more often, there’s a perfunctory, boxed-in compositional method that’s more in line with mid-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1300-eels/"" target=""_blank"">eels</a>.</p>
<p><i>Posthumous Release </i>doesn't lack ambition. Rather, it demonstrates the unique challenges inherent in making <i>small </i>music translate to an audience beyond the people immediately surrounding the ones who made it. If Cothran wanted to signify his ambition with bigger drums, string arrangements, or tremulous vocals, I imagine he would have done so. But when you look at the prime examples of small music done right-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"" target=""_blank"">Death Cab for Cutie</a>’s <i>We Have The Facts and We’re Voting Yes, </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15918-days/"" target=""_blank""><i>Days </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31022-waxahatchee/"" target=""_blank"">Waxahatchee</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17688-waxahatchee-cerulean-salt/"" target=""_blank"">Cerulean Salt</a>--</i> there’s a generosity within the lyrics and the hooks, a desire to share an experience rather than simply relate it. Cothran’s songs feel both insular and remote, staring off into the distance, clearly miserable but unwilling to really talk about it.</p></div>"|18120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18120-coma-cinema-posthumous-release/|6.1|Ian Cohen

Samberg’s jump into full-time movie making hasn’t quite stuck, leading to one film he’s hoping that everyone will forget about and one that seemed like a minor hit at first but turned out to be somewhat lifeless. Schaffer’s turn in the director’s chair for a pair of features-- 2007’s criminally underrated <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787475/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hot Rod </a></i>and 2012’s underwhelming <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1298649/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Watch</a></i>-- suggest he’s not quite ready for the upper tier in that role. Taccone is better known for his “Girls” character than for his own modern cult classic <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470023/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MacGruber</a></i>, though he’s certainly making a bundle as director for those ubiquitous “It’s Not Complicated” commercials for AT&amp;T. (Taccone technically left his job at “Saturday Night Live” before Schaffer and Samberg but continued to collaborate on Digital Shorts.) In a certain light, another Lonely Island album might seem like a desperate attempt to reinvigorate a fanbase that might have lost interest in the collective’s breed of joyfully silly farce.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Luckily <i>The Wack Album</i> is just as good as their previous collections, 2009’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12690-incredibad/"">Incredibad</a></i> and 2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15443-turtleneck-chain/"">Turtleneck &amp; Chain</a></i>. Knowing that the tracks would likely be divorced from memorable, NBC-funded visual complements this time around (a song like <i>Incredibad</i>’s <a href=""http://www.thelonelyisland.com/video/natalie-rap"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Natalie's Rap”</a> surely got the benefit of the doubt by merit of having a deviant Natalie Portman trashing shit in the “SNL” counterpart), it feels like the Lonely Island puts a little more oomph into the songs themselves, a little more intelligence into their parodies of overused rap album staples. (The operatic, hilarious leadoff “Dramatic Intro” and the ridiculous “I’m a Hustler (Song?)” are genre sendups as effective as any they’ve ever done, which includes the sublime <a href=""http://www.hulu.com/playlist/81182"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Jack Sparrow”</a>.) Sure, a few jokes fall flat, and a few run out of steam really fast-- the song where Andy raps from the perspective of Michael Bloomberg (“I Run NY”), two separate songs where they swap out “fuck” for “honk” and “hug”, respectively (“Hugs”, “I Don’t Give a Honk”)-- but that’s typical of a Lonely Island or, for that matter, a Weird Al record.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lonely Island’s jokes, for the most part, invent a ridiculous world and push the silliness to extremes, stretching the same idea in different directions (<a href=""http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/digital-short-yolo/n32022/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“YOLO”</a>) or continuing their mastery of sending up bro culture (“We Are a Crowd”, “The Compliments”). Sometimes the song might hint at a deeper meaning or stance; for instance, in a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9143-the-lonely-island/"" target=""_blank"">Pitchfork interview</a>, the group framed <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q9rLdxS7CE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Spring Break Anthem”</a> as their statement about gay marriage. Others, like “You’ve Got the Look” or the posse introduction riff “Meet the Crew”, are just straight up goofy fun. Andy, adopting rappers’ penchant for spelling words out to fit a rhyme pattern, strings together 69 seconds of rapid-fire alphabet for a lewd roundup of how his life is going. Kiv brags about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V35jvY0u7I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Diaper Money”</a>, having enough cashflow to keep his kids in fresh diapers, brags that escalate into “wife pussy”, and Andy’s ownership of a choice grave plot. All three playfully spin-off hashtag rap with the Solange feature “Semicolon”.</p>
<p>I like to think that the group’s output is spiritually influenced by something like Tamra Davis’ <i>Billy Madison</i>-- basically a sea of Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandlers’ inside jokes that you might not get, but a welcoming storm of inanity that you can’t help but enjoy. But what makes the <i>The Wack Album</i> work is the wide range of musical styles the group plants themselves in, from dubstep to “golden era” throwback rap, to auto-tuned R&amp;B to Samberg and Timberlake’s still-potent Color Me Badd riff <a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/243571"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“3-Way (The Golden Rule)”</a>. <i>The Wack Album</i> is full of smart hat-tips that underscore the fun, allusions to Digital Underground that flex the trio’s rap-loving roots.</p>
<p><i>The Wack Album</i>’s guests-- a murderer’s row of collaborators featuring the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"" target=""_blank"">Robyn</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"" target=""_blank"">Pharrell Williams</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"" target=""_blank"">Solange</a>, Hugh Jackman, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"" target=""_blank"">Lady Gaga</a>, Adam Levine, and more-- all seem to enjoy being there, an aspect that makes the jokes stronger. Though the group works largely without their former ace-in-the whole, Asa Taccone (Jorma’s younger brother, who ably handled the production of the first two Lonely Island albums but has been focusing on his own music lately) <i>The Wack Album</i>'s crew of rotating producers deliver a fresh sound palette that punches up the jokes and allows the Lonely Island to do what they do best-- try and make each other laugh. It’s silly, it’s in no shape or form subtle, it’s fun, it works. From “Lazy Sunday” to <i>The Wack Album</i>'s closing “Perfect Saturday”, you could argue that the group has hardly missed.</p></div>"|18169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18169-the-lonely-island-the-wack-album/|7.1|Corban Goble

Pitts spends most of <i>Pythons</i> pleading, bargaining, rationalizing, trying to make some sense of an increasingly dire situation in any way he can. There's a longstanding tendency in pop music to read too much autobiography into lyrics. In <i>Pythons</i>' case, this kind of conflation's all but unavoidable; just before it was recorded, an altercation with his then-girlfriend lead to Pitts' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47420-surfer-bloods-john-paul-pitts-arrested-for-battery/"" target=""_blank"">arrest for domestic battery</a>. Ultimately, no charges were filed, but as Pitts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9129-surfer-blood/"" target=""_blank"">told Pitchfork</a>, that same tumultuous relationship inspired many of <i>Pythons</i>' lyrics. Even before you hear one note, you may feel conflicted about it, and rightfully so. Truth be told, <i>Pythons</i> seem to feel pretty conflicted about itself: hooky, Weezer-ish guitar pop offset by desperate, discomfiting lyrics, fleeting hopes of reconciliation quickly dashed by heavy-hearted resignation.</p>
<p>Produced by Gil Norton (<i>Doolittle</i>, Del Amitri), <i>Pythons</i> is a sleeker affair than 2010's bedroom-born <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13844-astro-coast/"" target=""_blank""><i>Astro Coast</i></a> and 2011's knotty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15962-tarot-classics/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tarot Classics</i></a> EP. With 10 lean songs in 32 minutes, there's hardly a second to waste, so <i>Pythons</i> largely dispenses with pageantry and heads straight for the stomp box. Instrumentally, Surfer Blood's reared-on-Pavement looseness proves hard to shake even on these no-nonsense melodies; guitars dive-bomb into choruses, hooks turn into group shout-alongs. This more focused approach occasionally causes slight tunnelvision, songs that seem to rise and fall in essentially the same fashion. There are exceptions, of course: ""I Was Wrong"" dips a toe into grunge, and the waltzy ""Needles &amp; Pins"" harkens back to the Everly Brothers. But there's a satisfying simplicity in all those clean lines and bright-as-can-be hooks, a gleaming surface to bury the dark stuff under.</p>
<p><i>Pythons</i>' musical confidence is not shared by its narrator. Pitts spends the record sounding one kind of despondent after another: he points fingers, apologizes profusely, hopes something will change, realizes it won't. He sounds stuck in place, his mind constantly reeling, his next move unclear. Pitts certainly seems sorry for something; ""Gravity"" sees him making apologies for ""never stopping when we oughta,"" a line that both absorbs and assigns some of the blame for the shambolic romance described throughout. Pitts is quick to paint himself in an unflattering light: codependent, unstable, at fault. ""Blair Witch"" finds Pitts pleading, ""I need love, but the more I see love, the more I need love,"" an unguarded statement that suggests Pitts is at least aware he's got some stuff to work on. ""If I fell apart, would you stay?"" he asks at one point, aware of the awfulness of the situation but still willing to keep going with it, consequences be damned.</p>
<p>It doesn't always work; ""Say Yes to Me"" and ""Blair Witch"" affix themselves to a couple of phrases-- ""true blue"" and ""sour grapes"", respectively-- they can't quite rescue from cliche. Whenever the music gets heavier-- the verses of ""I Was Wrong"", bits of ""Slow Six""-- the lyrical self-flagellation and the muddy guitars congeal into a thick, momentum-halting sludge. The songwriting's fairly sturdy overall, but highlights are a little hard to come by; lead single ""Weird Shapes."" comes close, but there's really nothing here that'll knock the wind out of you quite like <i>Astro Coast</i>'s ""Swim"". Pitts proves adept at conjuring the confusion and conflict of the last days of a troubled relationship, and-- probably wisely-- makes himself seem fairly unsympathetic in the process. But he's not always so great at fleshing out the person on the other end of the line, which leaves <i>Pythons</i> feeling trapped in Pitts' head, a spot where plenty of listeners won't want to spend much time.</p>
<p>When I heard about John Paul Pitts' arrest last summer, my first response, like that of many others, was a swift and decisive, ""Fuck you."" Even as more information has come to light, my feelings haven't changed much; Pitts maintains his innocence, and plea-and-pass might be enough for the Florida courts where forgiveness is concerned, but without hearing the other side of the story, I'm still not so sure. <i>Pythons</i>, seething with autobiography, doesn't make it easy to forget the circumstances around its creation, and separating the art from the artists here takes some serious doing; that score at the top of the page is for <i>Pythons</i>, not the people who made it. With <i>Pythons</i> out there, Pitts is going to have to get up there again and again and sing these songs, so full of hurt and confusion, penitence and longing. We'll never know completely what happened that night, but I sincerely hope Pitts never lets himself forget it. As long as he's out there singing ""I Was Wrong"", he probably never will.</p></div>"|18123.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18123-surfer-blood-pythons/|6.7|Paul Thompson

Fewer would have suggested that this was a good thing.</p>
<p>From the start the Miami-born, New York-based group seemed more interested in provoking their audience than turning them into a traditional fan base. Its members were steadfastly anonymous, they never played live, and they only did press via emails that were either blithely pretentious or explicitly designed to be read as such. Their work extended over several forms of media, including a literary journal called <i>Death Notice</i>, and they insisted on referring to the entire project not as a band or a collective but as a “company,” which provoked as much suspicion in the indie scene of the time as their frequent use of drum machines.</p>
<p>In the years since, anonymity has gone from a quirk to a fad to an established PR tactic and artists have become increasingly expected to treat their visuals and internet presence as seriously as their music. That, and ambition-- whether aesthetic or careerist-- has ceased to be anathema to the counterculture. The most polarizing act of the mid-aughts would barely raise an eyebrow in 2013.</p>
<p>The intensely conceptual aspects of Lansing-Dreiden’s mission attracted more attention than the music itself, and they’ve come to make up the greater part of the “company”’s legacy. But revisiting the two albums and one EP that were originally released through Kemado, and have now been reissued on vinyl via Mexican Summer-- with new, tastefully minimalist cover art-- it’s apparent that they were ahead of the game on that level as well.</p>
<p>Their debut LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4964-the-incomplete-triangle/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Incomplete Triangle</i></a>, is the most straightforward of the three, in that some of the songs follow simple, conventional pop structures. For all of its potentially off-putting highbrow affectations, L-D was unabashedly influenced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"" target=""_blank"">the Beach Boys</a>’ ornate, gently psychedelic spin on standard pop tropes, and by Nuggets-era garage bands that bashed their way through well-worn blues formulas. Their first album opens with the “boom boom-boom crack” that’s been borrowed from the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby” several million times, and offers a substantial amount of harmonized vocals and jangly guitars doused in lo-fi overdrive and reverb. Which basically describes the sound their new label was founded on, and has come to define a large chunk of the underground rock that’s been made since then.</p>
<p>“Straightforward” is a relative term here, though. Even from the start, the group enjoyed surprising listeners with abrupt shifts in tone and style. The manic Turtles impression of “An Uncut Diamond” leads directly into the double-time palm-muted electric guitar that lends the postrock-inflected “Advancing Flags” an unexpectedly metal edge. And after a dozen pop songs the album closes with a suite of five ambient electronic tracks, an over-the-top flourish seemingly designed to goad critics into calling them “pretentious.”</p>
<p>Its follow-up, an EP titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4965-a-sectioned-beam/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Sectioned Beam</i></a><span>, offers less of a challenge. “Locks in Shadows” and “Spectrum of Vapor” are <i>Pet Sounds</i>-y and about as audience-friendly as L-D gets. “A Sectioned Beam” evokes both new wave and the Madchester sound, which at the time struck some critics as outre but after years of chillwave acts doing a similar thing it seems strange to think of as out of the ordinary. If it wasn’t for the 15-minute closing track or the fact that the record was intended as the soundtrack to a video the group made-- described on this site as “stark, picturesque scenes of plant life digitally mirrored to a vaguely hypnotic, kaleidoscopic effect”-- it would hardly even seem artsy these days.</span></p>

He lets them ram ceaselessly into each other like abandoned go-karts. And then, over a muted thump of a drum machine, he hollers into the void. That's his entire M.O., and on paper it sounds about as appetizing as sucking stale air from an open freezer. But Norrvide makes surprisingly tactile, even sensual music this way, and on <i>Perfect View</i>, his second full length in only six months, he rides his own modestly cresting wave. He is still making the exact same sound, and it remains narrowly captivating in the exact same way.</p>
<p>The production on <i>Perfect View </i>is marginally cleaner and warmer than last fall's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17366-growing-seeds/"" target=""_blank""><i>Growing Seeds</i></a>, making it a lusher and prettier listen. But these are relative terms-- “unnerving” and “lonely” probably suit Lust for Youth better. <i>Growing Seeds’ </i>particular unnerving loneliness came not just from its sonic murk but from the traces of unease the murk failed to cover, and <i>Perfect View</i>, with its richer, mellower synths and deeper sound, brings Norrvide closer into focus. But his thick Swedish accent, muffled by reverb, still keeps us at an arms-length from his message: When he repeatedly chants the title of “I Found Love”, it sounds more like, “I’ve fallen off.”</p>
<p>Norrvide has insisted in interviews that his songs are about love, relationships, and morality. They probably are, but you'll find very little in this music to tell you so. What you'll hear, above all, is a firm belief in the comfort of synthesizers-- the wide, lonely bands of sound they make, the cottony feeling they leave in your mind. The song titles function like blank, terse placards-- ""Another Day"", ""End"", ""Image""-- and the hum of the music acts similarly, as a mild anaesthetic, a small tonic for the times you'd rather erase your feelings for a few minutes than think about them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Sifting through </span><i>Perfect View </i><span>to find highlightable moments proves surprisingly difficult: there's the nearly-funky bongo break on “Another Day”, the little bits of sampled speech that pop up on ""Barcelona"" and elsewhere; “Kirsten” and closer “I Found Love in a Different Place” turn the drum hits way up, and hint at what Lust for Youth might eventually sound like if Norrvide cleared his throat and demanded our undivided attention. But these details melt the minute you stop focusing on them, and I think Norrvide means them to. Listening normally, the songs blur together like fan blades, and it's hard to tell how long you've been listening to </span><i>Perfect View</i><span>. His is the ambient music of someone else's party, happening far away from where you are, and the distance is part of the allure.</span></p></div>"|18122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18122-lust-for-youth-perfect-view/|6.9|Jayson Greene

Their last proper full-length, which came out 16 years ago, featured a punk rock band at the height of their power. The Memphis trio made music that was legitimately funny and provocative, and they made it sound <i>dangerous</i>. Between 1995 and 1997, they packed in blown out guitars and snarling, guttural vocals, all of which could have been filtered through a rusted out tin can. Their songs were fast and loud, and when they made their last proper record in 1997 with New Orleans weirdo composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3489-quintron/"">Mr. Quintron</a>, they sounded like the MC5 being backed by an organist. They weren't around for very long, but in their relatively short time together, they cemented themselves as godfathers to today's garage punk landscape.</p>
<p>Since then, all three members of the band have kept pretty busy. Jack Yarber made some solo albums under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29941-jack-oblivian/"">Jack Oblivian</a>, most recently on 2011's solid LP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15841-rat-city/"">Rat City</a></i>. Greg Cartwright became the frontman of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3645-reigning-sound/"">Reigning Sound</a>. Eric Friedl founded <a href=""http://www.goner-records.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goner Records</a>. So with some solid achievements under each of their belts, they're back with a reunion album that, in the context of other band reunions, arrives at an ideal time. They've been away for a while, sure, but not long enough to make <i>Desperation</i> remotely analogous to the new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17298-iggy-and-the-stooges/"" target=""_blank"">Iggy and the Stooges</a> record. (To say nothing of the music from <i>Ready to Die</i>, Oblivians don't have multiple decades seperating their new work and their best work.)</p>
<p>But there's something that needs to be considered when approaching <i>Desperation</i>: This is not the same Oblivians from 1995's <i>Soul Food</i>. This isn't a scrappy, lo-fi punk band brazenly giving songs titles like ""Then I Fucked Her"" or ""Nigger Rich"". (In fact, they've pretty much sworn off writing ""the nihilistic rock anthem"" following the deaths of some close friends, including Jay Reatard. Cartwright <a href=""http://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/lets-rock-and-roll-with-the-oblivians/Content?oid=3420828"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has said</a>, ""I don't want a record full of swear words. I don't want to offend people."") The influences sound similar, but <i>Desperation </i>sounds slicker than ever. Their singing is stripped of its former bite, and while they still ramp up the fuzz, it's a much cleaner-sounding album made at Dan Auerbach's Nashville studio. And as a whole, it's very inconsistent. There are songs that quickly reveal themselves as unfortunately repetitive (""Pinball King"", ""Fire Detector"") and others where the melody and tone just aren't that interesting over 2.5 minutes of music (""Oblivion""). Probably the biggest indication that they're no longer the same band: The songs written by Cartwright (like ""EM"" and ""Desperation"") sound more like a fuzzed out Reigning Sound, whose melodies tap more into 1960s pop than archival Oblivians did.</p>
<p>That's not to insult Reigning Sound, a band with great records-- those just aren't the sorts of songs you're conditioned to hear on an Oblivians record. So predictably, the strongest moments on <i>Desperation</i> come when the trio tap into the strengths from their old albums. ""Loving Cup"" is a ripping cover of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band track (in the tradition of their blistering 1995 cover of Lightnin' Hopkins' ""Vietnam War Blues""). ""Call the Police"" once again features Quintron's organ in a solid interpretation of Stephanie McDee's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b82Qt3STlIU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R&amp;B/zydeco track</a>. Two of Yarber's writing contributions are huge highlights: the punk burner ""Run For Cover"" and the doe-eyed ballad ""Little War Child"". But with this album going in so many directions, the inevitable duds, which flank the highlights, make it hard to get excited about it as a whole.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Friedl <a href=""http://www.getbent.fm/interview-eric-oblivian-on-gonerfest-memphis-and-the/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">joked</a>, ""People will hate [<i>Desperation</i>] when it comes out and in 30 years, when it doesn’t matter anymore, kids will think it’s really great."" Maybe this was Friedl's admission that the Oblivians grew up and inevitably made an album that didn't sound anything like their early work. Maybe he's saying that this album needs to be given its own context and removed from the pressures that come along with being the first Oblivians album in nearly two decades. And that's fair-- history and high expectations can irrevocably mar the way you take in a band's post-reunion album. But down the line, the kids will probably still have access to <i>Soul Food</i>, <i>Popular Favorites</i>, and <i>Play 9 Songs With Mr. Quintron.</i> Ultimately, those albums are more immediately gratifying and fun than this one.</p></div>"|18095.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18095-the-oblivians-desperation/|6.2|Evan Minsker

Brothers Cullen and Cameron Omori and their friend Max Kakacek laid down the sandpaper bubblegum of their 2009 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13358-smith-westerns/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a> when they were still in high school; by the time of 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15016-dye-it-blonde/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dye it Blonde</i></a>, they were gleefully glomming onto the grandiosity of their classic-rock heroes, in the musical and “extracurricular” senses. Seeing Smith Westerns on the <i>Dye it Blonde </i>tour was like (I imagine) witnessing Faster Pussycat on the Sunset Strip in the late 1980s-- the music was very loud, the band appeared to be a little partied out, and the vibe of youthful decadence verged on self-destructive. As good as the first two Smith Westerns albums were, I questioned whether they could forge a career-- or even make it to the next gig. They were living out their college years in a rock‘n’roll band, a more eye-opening education in some ways, though it doesn’t exactly prepare you for adulthood.</p>
<p>On Smith Westerns’ latest, <i>Soft Will, </i>the band still sounds like a bunch of cocky kids with a preternatural understanding of 1970s glam-rock aesthetics and the physics of power pop songcraft. But the swagger has been tempered along with the tempos; a preference for stately balladry over snotty stompers steers <i>Soft Will </i>away from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7903-electric-warrior/"" target=""_blank""><i>Electric Warrior </i></a>and into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8391-george-harrison/"" target=""_blank""><i>All Things Must Pass </i></a>territory.</p>
<p>Lyrically, <i>Soft Will </i>is like the undergraduate version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a>’s recent post-doctoral dissertation on mortality, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17963-vampire-weekend-modern-vampires-of-the-city/"" target=""_blank"">Modern Vampires of the City</a></i>-- VW’s cautious “Diane Young” could be an answer record to <i>Dye it Blonde</i>’s celebratory “All Die Young”. Omori is just getting to the point where he can finally see outside of himself, and understand that the world is a big, scary, unknowable place that you might not have licked after all. “I thought I was a loner until I went out on my own,” he sings on <i>Will</i>’s beatific closing track “Varsity”, as bell-like synths echo back to one of the all-time great “you’re all alone now, bub,” classics, Naked Eyes’ “Always Something There to Remind Me”. <i>Soft Will </i>culminates with a graduation of sorts-- Smith Westerns have survived their adolescence as a band, learned the right lessons, and (gasp) seem to have grown up.</p>
<p>While the band’s outlook has matured, what hasn’t changed on <i>Soft Will </i>is Smith Westerns’ ability to turn out instantly likeable guitar and synth-based hooks at a prodigious rate. “3am Spiritual” opens <i>Will </i>with a callback to <i>Dye it Blonde, </i>as a simple six-string strum and lilting keyboard figure give way to a heart-tugging “Whoa! Yeah!” chorus. It’s a songwriting trick learned from poring over records that were born around the time the band members were-- <i>Bandwagonesque </i>and <i>I Should Coco </i>and (definitely) <i>Definitely Maybe. </i>Smith Westerns aren’t interested in changing up their formula, they’ve merely found a way to utilize it more thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Just as <i>Dye it Blonde </i>sounded like <i>Smith Westerns </i>with better (or any) production and more sophisticated songwriting, <i>Soft Will </i>elaborates on <i>Dye it Blonde </i>by sharpening the choruses-- the “tell me tell me tell me the answer 'cuz I’m not sure” bit from “Idol” is particularly sticky-- and refining the arrangements. On the instrumental “XXIII”, <i>Soft Will </i>even approaches the elegance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"" target=""_blank"">Air</a>’s score for Sofia Coppola's <i>The Virgin Suicides, </i>evoking a similar end-of-childhood dread with its cinematic mix of doomy piano chords and spectral string swooshes. Smith Westerns have given their own coming-of-age an appropriately majestic soundtrack. (The guitar riff on ""Best Friend"" is like a cross between CC Deville's guitar solo from Poison’s “Something to Believe In” and Clarence Clemons’ sax solo from Springsteen’s “Jungleland”.)</p>
<p>In the context of Smith Westerns’ discography, <i>Soft Will </i>is both a fresh start and a conclusion to the first part of the band’s career. In case it needs be pointed out: Smith Westerns have already built an impressive battery of records. Few groups do wistfully melodic trad-rock any better right now. Smith Westerns haven’t only not burned out, they’re a budding institution.</p></div>"|18110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18110-the-smith-westerns-soft-will/|7.9|Steven Hyden

The Danish duo count <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and Pharrell amongst their many famous fans. It’s not hard to see their appeal: Airtight and carefully virtuosic, they’re perfectly wrapped up in their own hermetically sealed pop world. The attraction largely boils down to singer Coco O’s elastic voice, sometimes chirpy and sometimes soulful. She works in the tradition of the last decade’s neo-soul elite, channeling the jazzy effortlessness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5185-amy-winehouse/"" target=""_blank"">Amy Winehouse</a> circa <i>Frank</i> and the vulnerability of also-ran Duffy, shapeshifting between extremes mid-song. <i>Avalanche </i>is the duo’s second album, and the one that’s poised to earn them wider attention off the back of simple and effective songcraft.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Coco’s partner is Robin Hannibal, also the mastermind behind buzzed-about R&amp;B act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye/"" target=""_blank"">Rhye</a>. <i>Avalanche</i> is dominated by his touch, an oh-so-perfect production hand that brings to mind the fastidious fuss of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/"" target=""_blank"">Fleetwood Mac</a> minus the shag carpet thud. This all-consuming perfection is at once Quadron’s most alienating and tantalizing quality-- no alarms and no surprises-- set out in clear tones from the very beginning with “LFT”. Cautious horns, careful guitar, and flamboyant strings offer an impossibly polished surface for Coco’s vocals to glide over, singing a melody that’s just twisty enough not to challenge the listener. “Yes I’m still looking/ Looking for trouble,” she intones defiantly, as if trying to prove her own edginess in a world of perfectly rounded corners.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The duo have deservedly received plenty of pre-release attention for <i>Avalanche’</i>s first single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15097-hey-love/"" target=""_blank"">“Hey Love”</a>. With its throbbing hand percussion and Timbaland-worthy vocal snippets, it has all the precociousness of one of those folky ditties that soundtracked iPod commercials at their ubiquitous peak in the mid 2000s. It’s bolstered with an earworm of a chorus, but it’s a bit of a fake-out: <i>Avalanche</i> prefers intimate ballads over perky pop, offering nothing else as jaunty as “Hey Love”. That’s not a bad thing in itself, but the songs feel a little insincere when saddled with the band’s generic lyrics.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The way Coco borrows mannerisms from country, 60s pop, and other recognizable signifiers brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/"" target=""_blank"">Camera Obscura</a> stripped of their excess and showmanship. But her lyrics lack that band's depth and detail, meaning her vocal tics have to pick up the slack. On songs like “Crush”, she’s front and centre, exploring every corner of her voice, and moving from raspy and snarky to hurt and forlorn at the flip of a coin. These slower tracks are a catch 22, however, because when she doesn’t have a stellar melody to orient her, like on “Befriend”, it feels like she’s merely stringing together cliches. Other attempts at more upbeat pop (“Neverland”, “It’s Gonna Get You”) are anodyne and patently inoffensive, music made to be quietly piped through coffee shop speakers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But when they’re on, they’re on. <i>Avalanche</i> ends with a stretch of soft-rock stunners, including the heartfelt title track and the slide guitar daydream of “Sea Salt”. “Better Off”, with its summer afternoon swing and gentle ebb, is arguably the album’s best song-- here Coco’s vocals sound expert and controlled, topped off with an appearance from a sedate Kendrick Lamar. He’s neutered and hushed to fit into their own cultivated world, because above all, Quadron inhabit a very specific universe on <i>Avalanche</i>, one where no note or sound is out of place. If schlocky FM-lite pop is what you’re into, there’s lots to like on <i>Avalanche</i>, but it’s an album that feels hard to love. <i>Avalanche</i>’s obsessive squeaky cleanness keeps its audience at a distance. Coco might insist that she’s still looking for trouble, but there’s none to be found on <i>Avalanche.</i></p></div>"|18089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18089-quadron-avalanche/|7.0|Andrew Ryce

They found success and relative fame early, with ferocious records that jump-started the conversation about rap and reignited much of the controversy that lent the genre its vitality. And, thus far, like many who succeed early, they haven't been able to recapture the energy of that first terrific surge.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of ways to distinguish OF from the stereotype of the child star, obvious in the posse’s DIY aesthetic, their self-reliance, and their instinctive drive towards musical exploration. You could see those qualities in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler</a>'s summer mixes as DJ Stank Daddy, in the interesting failure of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29960-the-internet/"" target=""_blank"">the Internet</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16145-purple-naked-ladies/"" target=""_blank"">Purple Naked Ladies</a></i>, and in the psychedelic leanings of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29181-domo-genesis/"" target=""_blank"">Domo Genesis</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16957-no-idols/"" target=""_blank""><i>No Idols</i></a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16957-no-idols/"" target=""_blank""> </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29241-hodgy-beats/"" target=""_blank"">Hodgy Beats</a>’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16355-untitled-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Untitled</a></i> EP. And you can see those qualities at their best on the collective’s newest effort, <i>The Jellyfish Mentality</i>.</p>
<p>The album is officially the work of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31414-the-jet-age-of-tomorrow/"" target=""_blank"">the Jet Age of Tomorrow</a>, the production duo that consists of Matt Martians and Hal Williams. Martians is also one half of the Internet, and the main producer behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30612-kilo-kish/"" target=""_blank"">Kilo Kish</a>. His consistent interest in exploring the worlds of funk and acid jazz keeps the collective expanding their borders. The real reason that Odd Future’s music-- rather than rhetoric-- still deserves attention lies in the way that they consistently stoke their melting pot with the next logical set of musical influences.</p>
<p><i>The Jellyfish Mentality</i> expands on the Soular Groove template that Martians has worked with in the past, adding a hard psychedelic edge to his standard combination of claphappy beats and acid-jazz synth fills. The initial run of tracks here is mesmerizing, extending from the opener “Warping Walls” to the chorus and beat of the transfixing “Juney Jones”. Unfortunately, it’s then that the rappers show up.</p>
<p>The downside of the DIY aesthetic is that it can mean a lack of discipline; a fixation on getting things done often means getting them done quickly. That’s clear on the album’s verses. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1669-mike-g/"" target=""_blank"">Mike G</a> does his lackadaisical, post-lyrical thing; Casey Veggies and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"" target=""_blank"">Earl</a>, two of the most talented rappers here, restrain themselves with one-take verses (Casey bests Earl, which should tell you that something’s off). Mac Miller shows up to piss off the critics. Other than a few hard-charging late verses from Williams on “Squares” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29181-domo-genesis/"" target=""_blank"">Domo Genesis</a> and Vince Staples on “Wonderful World”, no one sounds like they’re trying too much harder than the jejune Kish.</p>
<p>In contrast, the choruses throughout the record are plenty catchy, a testament to the pocket that Martians and Williams have created in each and every beat. The hook on the aforementioned “Juney Jones” is an earworm, likewise those of “Not So Scary” and the barely-there mutter on “Superfine”, where a simple twist of pronunciation keeps the phrase “you are superfine” in your head for hours after listening. In fact, there’s only one bum hook in the bunch, courtesy of Jesse Boykins III.</p>
<p>There’s a sense of anything-goes exploration that keeps <i>Jellyfish</i> interesting, even as it stretches out over 21 tracks (and 25 if you count the bonus songs that were already released). Not many young producers have this kind of imagination or panache, and the tape abounds with daring, idiosyncratic choices, creating a psychedelic alternative to the alt-world pop that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3021-nerd/"" target=""_blank"">N.E.R.D.</a> introduced with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3021-nerd/"" target=""_blank""><i>In Search Of...</i></a> The downside of succeeding early is the risk of burning out. But the curiosity and work ethic that the Jet Age of Tomorrow show here proves continually impressive.</p></div>"|18166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18166-the-jet-age-of-tomorrow-the-jellyfish-mentality/|6.6|Jonah Bromwich

Though our dystopian visionary surely meant to slyly reference far more sinister puppet masters with his damning and oh-so-quotable bon mot, the unruly hellions pulling rock’n’roll’s nylon strings are less inclined to read between the lines. They prefer to go back to basics but slap a few fresh coats of paint on there to keep things sparkling. The song remains the same, and on <i>The Eldritch Dark</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31324-blood-ceremony/"" target=""_blank"">Blood Ceremony</a> follows that axiom with near-religious fervor.</p>
<p>Every chord and whisper harkens back to an earlier Aquarian age, when paisley and peyote ruled supreme and leather fringe wasn’t just for your dad’s musty old biker jacket. Their longtime fixation on 70s rock, Sabbathian riffage, and 60s psych is well-documented and undeniable, and an enduring fascination with dark legend and wild lore charts their pagan’s progress from harvest moon to Midsummer’s night eve. The third album from this Canadian collective is their strongest yet, and clear proof that while yes, everything old is new again, there are a scant few armed with the passion and power to craft something worth revisiting. Blood Ceremony just make it look easy.</p>
<p>“Witchwood” begins with a howling lead and hauls out the Hammond organ, vamping and swaying along beneath Alia O’Brien’s husky croon. This down-to-earth high priestess has got her hands full wielding the microphone, manipulating the vintage organ keys, and trilling away like Jethro Tull with her signature flute whilst conducting the band’s blackest of masses. The Satanic element one has come to expect from the recent glut of “occult rock” bands is absent, and in its stead lie mysteries far more titillating and obscure. The old gods hold court amongst the evils and enchantments that populate Blood Ceremony’s world. Capering fauns, weird sisters, astrological signs, and bewitched souls creep in and out of earshot, imbuing tracks like “Ballad of the Weird Sisters” with a certain otherworldly feel even as they build upon standard 70s hard rock song structures.</p>
<p>Guitarist Sean Kennedy weaves his riffs over and under the flue’s driving force, stealing the spotlight when it suits but generally content to serve as the stage upon which O’Brien’s finery flashes. Michael Carrillo’s drums are understated, slung low in the mix but never far from the action; his militant rat-a-tat in the titular “The Eldritch Dark” serves as a steady anchor for the song’s psychedelic meanderings, and gels perfectly with the burly basslines. “Drawing Down the Moon” is the most vintage-inspired of a host of backward-glancing tracks. Kennedy’s note-perfect Iommi riff wails away while O’Brien channels Marianne Faithfull and Jethro Tull like some heathen love child and pounds that Hammond organ for all of its considerable worth. It’s hip-shaking, head-nodding, sideways-glance-throwing nighttime music. If the Devil were really listening, he’d have booked these guys as his house band long ago.</p>
<p>The hymn-like “Lord Summerisle” is quiet and contemplative, recalling the quietest moments of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"" target=""_blank"">Black Sabbath</a>’s “Planet Caravan” and guided by a particularly haunting flute melody. It’s the only song to feature a male vocalist, as bassist Lucas Gadke (who wrote the tune in homage to the eerie atmosphere of cult film ‘The Wicker Man’) adds his plaintive voice to O’Brien’s backing harmonies, and also the strangest. Blood Ceremony hit upon their alchemical formula years ago, but it’s still refreshing to see them experiment, just a little. Too much, and their spell would break; just enough, and they prove once again why they are the most vital band of the “occult rock” renaissance. Trends come and go, but a band like Blood Ceremony, with their bewitching tunes and dark secrets, are above such petty mortal trifles. We’re coming with them, whether we like it or not.</p></div>"|18084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18084-blood-ceremony-the-eldritch-dark/|7.6|Kim Kelly

The track wasn’t as brilliant as it was an exciting look into a new wave of UK bass for which Benga would later become a mascot. “Night”, his 2007 collaboration with Digital Mystikz’ Coki, is easily one of the greatest dubstep tracks of all time, wherein melodic, funky, and chomping guttural bass play a game of tug-of-war. When the UK’s basement dance scene slowly began creeping outwards, Benga stayed on track; he became part of dubstep super-group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29277-magnetic-man/"">Magnetic Man</a> alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14235-skream/"">Skream</a> and Artwork, scored a BBC Radio 1 show, and in 2011 turned his production know-how into pop sheen for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29414-katy-b/"">Katy B</a>’s breakout single, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNhPYj-5rIY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Katy on a Mission”</a>, and her next hit “Perfect Stranger” (producing the latter as Magnetic Man). With the release of his newest, third full-length <i>Chapter II</i>, one thing is clear; this is not <i>that</i> Benga.</p>
<p>There’s nothing harder for a fan of Benga than to hear him produce with relevancy in mind. <i>Chapter II </i>is full of festival-leaning ideas: razor-edged <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a> bass, ambient trance synths, vocalists singing about love and stuntin' on rivals. And it’s no surprise that the producer comes closest to pop-friendly bangers when he uses female vocalists and builds under them. “Smile” features <a href=""http://ec2-54-225-238-235.compute-1.amazonaws.com/admin/albumreviews/albumreview/18146/pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a> in “Take My Hand”-fashion; half-melodrama and half-defiant punk as bass wubs beneath her and melodic keys sparkle around her. “Higher” fares similarly; its day-glo trance synths build to a frenetic drum and bass beat that leads the singer through love in the club. The pair were no doubt made with radio-play and EDM fandom in mind, but still translate as lesser-than when put in context with the strength of his previous large-scale hits.</p>
<p>And perhaps that’s part of the problem: <i>Chapter II</i> often appears to be catering to tastes when its creator's greatest successes come when he's doing anything but. Benga is one of the DJs that helped made dubstep a pop reference in the first place; before Bieber and will.i.am, there was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27831-la-roux/"" target=""_blank"">La Roux</a> and Skream, Britney and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28713-rusko/"" target=""_blank"">Rusko</a>, Katy B and Benga. (Which also forces the questions: Why isn’t Katy B anywhere to be found on this album? And will he be on her forthcoming one?) Instead of pushing forward, all too often the DJ just toes the line of cliched dance pop; “There’s No Soul” unfortunately lives up to its name.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There are some decent ideas to be found here, though, and Benga’s technical production savvy is still something to be admired. “Click and Tap” is a gem where loops of tightly-rolled snares are joined by pulsing, melodic bass lines, and the track ends up serving as an interlude to “Forefather”, which brings out rapper and grime MC Kano to complement Benga’s gritty dubstep pumelling. “To Hell and Back” is a moshpit-ready explosion of abrasive propulsion with menacing kickdrums and wailing horns on the hook. Its chug of battling beats could have followed the producer’s catchy “Baltimore Clap”. The problem with <i>Chapter II</i> is that even the album’s high points are only just good, when the dubstep world has reasonably come to expect <i>great</i> things from Benga.</p></div>"|18146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18146-benga-chapter-ii/|5.7|Puja Patel

The San Francisco band's early shows found a scrappy, ambitious bunch of punk kids trying to warp black metal with shoegaze in a way that, for all its advances, felt familiar. In late 2010, they signed to <a href=""http://www.deathwishinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Deathwish</a>, the label run by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"" target=""_blank"">Converge</a>'s Jacob Bannon, and there were expectations in the underground. (Though, at that time, people seemed to focus more on the fact that they didn't <i>look</i> like a metal band than what they were creating.) When vocalist George Clarke and songwriter/guitarist Kerry McCoy released their debut LP, <i>Roads to Judah</i>, in 2011, they added wrinkles to that live sound, especially on the opening track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12635-violet/"" target=""_blank"">""Violet""</a>. The collection didn't always match those standards. It sometimes felt muddled, like they were trying to squeeze too much into the frame.</p>
<p>But that gorgeous 12-minute set-piece established the template and scope for the band's excellent sophomore album, <i>Sunbather</i>, a record that finds Deafheaven living up to and then surpassing expectations. Basically, they've learned how to take the sounds they've dreamed up out of their heads so we can hear them, too. If you go back and listen to <i>Roads</i>, you'll find the elements that appear on <i>Sunbather </i>with 10 times the intensity. So while the approach here  isn't a surprise, the force with which Deafheaven pulls it off is a revelation.</p>
<p><i>Sunbather</i>'s a seven-song collection that fuses into a massive 60-minute piece. The sequencing, moving from brightness to darkness and back, is brilliant. Throughout, McCoy gives in to his inner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2684-johnny-marr/"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Marr</a>, offering deeper, prettier, more eclectic guitar tones. His lines are smeary with tremolo and delay, and the band seamlessly incorporates melancholic piano, harsh Godflesh-style noise bursts, spoken word, lush acoustic strums, and eerie samples. That, and new drummer Daniel Tracy plays big, adding a wallop they've missed in the past. (Deafheaven have always been Clarke and McCoy with a shifting lineup around them; let's hope this one lasts.)</p>
<p>This is music that inspires the kind of wide-screen feelings people look for in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">Sigur Rós</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"" target=""_blank"">Mogwai</a> (who Deafheaven <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14408-punk-rockcody/"" target=""_blank"">have covered</a>), or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"" target=""_blank"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a>. Words of anger and frustration collide with the sheer beauty of the music. The power of that blend-- raw black metal and hardcore basking in pastel-colored post-rock guitars-- is something you don't experience in those other groups. There are plaintive moments here, but this is largely music about romantic lust, anger, and disappointment delivered by a band who know their punk and hardcore as well as their metal. They know their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">Cure</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">the Smiths</a>, too. Remember the ecstatic closing moments of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5684-fuck-buttons/"" target=""_blank"">Fuck Buttons</a>' ""Sweet Love for Planet Earth""? Loop that and ask <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"" target=""_blank"">Explosions in the Sky</a> to play the accompanying music and you're tapping into this sound.</p>
<p>While Deafheaven push this epic music as far as it can go, they retain a central emotional core, and are always in control compositionally. The opening song, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15379-deafheaven-dreamhouse/"" target=""_blank"">Dream House</a>"", is over nine minutes long; the closer, ""The Pecan Tree"", which moves from dire black metal to triumphant post-rock without any stitches showing, is closer to 12. The four longer songs don't repeat themselves; each is stunning in its constant motion and variation. ""Sunbather"" is bleaker than ""Dream House"", for instance, and on ""Vertigo"", they downshift from gossamer prettiness to full-on heavy with a warped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a> transition followed by their most power metal guitar soloing to date. At the five-minute mark of that song, blast beats enter and it goes black metal. Two minutes later, though, it's soaring again with hook-laden guitars and floor-punching dynamics.</p>
<p>Even the interstitial parts inspire. ""Dream House""'s delicate closing arpeggios blend with ""Irresistible"",  a three-minute swatch of melancholic guitar and piano that works as a gentle pause before the massive ""Sunbather"", but is in of itself a gorgeous composition. The grinding industrial noise at the end of ""Sunbather"" dissolves into ""Please Remember"", a relatively brief piece that features Alcest's Neige speaking lines from Milan Kundera's novel <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>. (Clarke explained its inclusion in a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/9140-deafheaven/"" target=""_blank"">Show No Mercy</a>: ""That passage is really important to me. It just screams insecurity, which I have huge faults with."") </p>
<p>Clarke's voice mixed with the mountains of cascading guitars and drum crescendos is so strong that you don't need to know what he's saying to feel the effect of the music. But if you <i>do</i> decide to read the lyrics, you won't be disappointed: <i>Sunbather</i> was in part inspired by the singer growing up with his mother and brother without any money and wondering what it'd be like to have it. There's also his realization that, like his largely absent father, he's able to be cold emotionally, and not necessary able to love. The album's central image is of a girl sunbathing outside of her upscale house. Clarke spotted her after moving back home for a bit and while stuck in an existential crisis. He wondered what he'd end up doing himself and, more so, what it would be like to have that girl's existence. And, of course, what it would be like to have that girl. ""Dream House"" ends with a dialogue Clarke says he pieced together from drunken texts between him and a woman he was crazy about: ""'I'm dying.'/ 'Is it blissful?'/ 'It's like a dream.'/ 'I want to dream.'""</p>
<p>With <i>Sunbather</i>, Deafheaven have made one of the biggest albums of the year, one that impresses you with its scale, the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Seer</i></a> did last year. Like M. Gira's masterpiece, it has the ability to capture the attention of people who don't normally listen to heavy music. It's also one of the most successful examples of a band using black metal as a starting point and ending up somewhere else entirely. People cite the short-lived San Francisco band Weakling's seminal 2000 album <i>Dead as Dreams</i> as the pinnacle of American black metal; <i>Sunbather</i> is another. Like Weakling, Deafheaven have changed things with this record-- black metal won't be the same now that it's been released. Of course, folks will argue over just how black metal-- or even metal-- <i>Sunbather</i> is, and will discuss the ""un-metal"" pink cover art and the fact that Clarke could probably be a J. Crew model. These kinds of arguments are irrelevant. Instead, try focusing on how much better <i>Sunbather</i> is than any other black metal album released this year, and how it's, by far, one of the best in any genre. Or, maybe, just talk to your friends about what it feels like to listen to a modern classic.</p></div>"|18060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18060-deafheaven-sunbather/|8.9|Brandon Stosuy

The Man</a>, <i>Evil Friends</i>, is rarely the same from one minute to the next, careening between alt-rock bombast, punk snot, Lumineersy campfire singalongs, pixelated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a> headbandcore, dawdling <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/8391-george-harrison/"" target=""_blank"">George Harrison</a> solos; you name it, <i>Evil Friends</i> has probably stuck it somewhere. All that might sound like more than one album can bear, but funnily enough, <i>Evil Friends</i> is just about the least convoluted Portugal LP so far. With Brian ""Danger Mouse"" Burton behind the boards, <i>Evil Friends</i> finds Portugal sharpening their poppier instincts while still leaving room for the proggy ambitions that got them there.</p>
<p>At least as far back as 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13270-the-satanic-satanist/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Satanic Satanist</i></a>, Portugal's hooks sharpened, their restless compositions cut with flyaway choruses. With Burton's help, Portugal continue to clear a path through the fracas; he hasn't done much to tamp down their taste for maximalism, but he's certainly helped them sculpt the melee into something a little less unwieldy, making sure these songs have enough hook to carry the weight of all the instrumental bedlam swirling around them.</p>
<p>It's not a perfect fit; every surface glistens, and Burton certainly helps Portugal keep a lot of balls in the air while staying mindful of information overload, but his mix has that bright-as-the-sun quality of most modern major label rock that leads to fatigue after too long. And he seems to have talked John Gourley into sticking to the upper ranges of his acrobatic pipes, a move that won't likely sit well with every Portugal fan. Still, Burton helps Portugal keep some control of what could easily turn to chaos, taking great care with their elaborate embellishments.</p>
<p>With Burton at their backs, Portugal take a surefooted approach on <i>Evil Friends</i>, confidently blasting through these pan-genre Frankensongs. But, just as the music seems to reposition itself every few seconds, so do John Gourley's lyrics, albeit with a lower success rate. He makes a couple of things clear on <i>Friends</i>: he's anti-apathy (the presumably ironic ""Creep in a T-Shirt""), pro-ecstasy (""Purple Yellow Red and Blue"", featuring two-thirds of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a>), and more than a little conflicted about religion. ""We don't need no modern Jesus to roll with us,"" he notes. ""Who cares if hell awaits,"" he wonders a bit later, ""we're having drinks at heaven's gate.""</p>
<p>But then there's ""Hip Hop Kids"". What starts out as a stroll with his young daughter takes a sudden turn into bile-spewing rebuke: ""You hip-hop kids think we give a shit when we don't,"" he spits, apropos of... your guess is as good as mine. Gourley seems like a pleasant enough dude, so this ""get off my lawn"" thing has to be an act; either way, it doesn't work, the song's tart melody spiked with this untoward bitterness. Several songs on <i>Evil Friends</i> sport choruses that seem at odds with their verses, or stabs at profundity that don't hold up under scrutiny. With everything else floating around these songs, they could occasionally use an anchor, a task Gourley's flimsier lyrics aren't always up for.</p>
<p>It took me maybe four or five good listens before <i>Evil Friends</i> stopped <span>setting off my claustrophobia</span>. Even with prolonged exposure, <i>Evil Friends</i>' ever-present busyness can be overwhelming; there's a lot-- and sometimes too much-- going on here. Still, even when their ambitions outpace their execution, Portugal deserve their props for continuing to overshoot the mark. <span>Seven albums in, with a seemingly permanent mid-day slot at almost every decent-sized festival on either side of the pond and a big-name producer on their side, Portugal. The Man could've easily spent <i>Evil Friends</i> shedding complexities and doubling down on catchiness. The frequently overstuffed, occasionally scatterbrained album is far from perfect. But even when going for broke gets them into trouble, Portugal seem happy to get up there and overshoot the mark.</span></p></div>"|18098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18098-portugal-the-man-evil-friends/|6.0|Paul Thompson

""Up Down Up Down"" from 2009 matched elegant patterns to a skittering beat, delivered via a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrq8WJYwOwY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube clip</a> depicting traffic pouring in and out of a city. Now, some four years later, Roberts is all about suspending figures in time, chopping out the forward thrust altogether. The basic elements were already in place-- cut the beats from ""Up Down Up Down"" and the track wouldn't sound out of place on <i>Yūgen</i>, a five-track EP for <a href=""http://theyoungturks.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Young Turks</a> that forms the most significant Koreless release to date. But this isn't simply a case of Roberts figuring out where he can go by muting the drum tracks on his sequencer. There's a whole world of thought in <i>Yūgen</i>, a creeping sense that its weightlessness was only arrived at after long hours of procrastination.</p>
<p>Roberts discussed how his music is positioned far from anything that could be described as <br/>""real"" in a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9135-koreless/"">Rising</a> feature, emphasizing his love of artifice and rigidity. There's no looseness here, no feeling of him trying to overmatch the binary code scrolling down his screen. Instead, there's a sense of parity between man and machine, of Roberts respecting the framing devices his artificial working partner puts around his output. There's a feeling not dissimilar to the one <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> found on ""Computer Love"", where a tender synthesis of human emotions and mechanics are set in motion. At its best, on a track like the stuttering closer ""Never"", this EP resembles something like dialect between Roberts and his computer, getting close to Isaac Asimov's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robopsychology"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">concept</a> of a study of the personalities of intelligent machines. It makes even more sense when you learn that Roberts is a committed sci-fi fan.</p>
<p>If the goal of <i>Yūgen</i> is to remove the everyday from the equation, it only partly succeeds. But this isn't necessarily a failing of the piece; far from it. In fact, the sense of human emotion that bleeds into each track is what makes it so inviting. It shifts through feelings of loss, hope, and unease, with Roberts often fudging the sound to take it to the brink of malfunction. At times it's reminiscent of a clear-eyed take on the experiments <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30721-daniel-lopatin/"">Daniel Lopatin</a> has uploaded to YouTube under his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/sunsetcorp?feature=watch"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SunsetCorp</a> moniker, especially when he splices the vocal sample on ""Ivana"" across acres of chimerical synths. It's a very visual record, reflecting the way the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2/"">Haxan Cloak</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17732-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2-excavation/""><i>Excavation</i></a> conjured up images of a painfully laborious stumble through the afterlife. But <i>Yūgen</i> is more future dystopia than hellish fantasia. ""Sun"" is all glassy skyscrapers crashing into a purple sea, ripped straight from the cover of a pulpy mid-century science fiction novel.</p>
<p>While lost in <i>Yūgen</i>'s world, it is useful to think back at how the Koreless sound has evolved; the earlier <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QVadIgPglM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""4D""</a> had traces of a soulful vocal, something Roberts would surely balk at now. His remix work for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5720-foals/"">Foals</a> seems even more incongruous, but presumably the paycheck makes up for it. Still, even in those pieces you can hear him slowly beginning to erase the world from his work. <i>Yūgen</i> is likely to feel similarly transitory to those early releases. This feels like a beginning, a place that Roberts has worked toward that isn't necessarily going to be where he's going to land. In the Rising feature he talks of more rules, more restrictions, getting to a point where ""I don't get any input into it,"" as he puts it. That thought echoes common considerations about true artificial intelligence, something that feels potentially terrifying and revelatory, but leaves the future tantalizingly wide open.</p></div>"|18080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18080-koreless-yugen-ep/|7.4|Nick Neyland

But in the case of William Cashion and Bruce Willen’s new joint venture, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31151-peals/"" target=""_blank"">Peals</a>, it feels less like a time-killing indulgence than a therapeutic necessity. With their respective bands-- glamboyant synth pop fops <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28423-future-islands/"" target=""_blank"">Future Islands</a> and art punk bruisers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5580-double-dagger/"" target=""_blank"">Double Dagger</a>-- the two have played active roles in making Baltimore’s Wham City scene one the most vibrant, prolific, and relentlessly excitable music communities to emerge in the past decade. And though they’re situated on opposite ends of the post-punk spectrum, Future Islands and Double Dagger have cross-pollinated before, with the former’s frontman, Sam Herring, lending his outsized, balcony-bound voice to “The Lie/The Truth”, the anthemic standout on the latter’s 2009 release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12960-more/"" target=""_blank""><i>More</i></a>. With Peals, however, Cashion and Willen are less interested in exploring any aesthetic overlap between their two bands than distancing themselves from both. Even those living in an inspired, utopian environment like Wham City occasionally need a vacation.</p>
<p><i>Walking Field</i> thus represents Cashion and Willen’s escape to cottage country, an opportunity to decompress, clear their heads, and experiment with more relaxed, exploratory modes of music-making than their day jobs allow. (True to their mellow-out mission, the duo have taken to performing in a stage set-up that resembles a living room.) The album’s eight tracks are entirely instrumental, and vocals aren’t the only thing missing here-- the record is completely devoid of bass and drums, instead deploying clean acoustic/electric guitar patterns, chimes, percussive mic taps, and third-eye-prying synth lines to establish a blissful sense of weightlessness. But <i>Walking Field</i> isn’t just some random exercise in blurry post-rock atmospherics. Cashion and Willen’s sense of melody is as rich as their textural layering, resulting in pieces that are immediately engaging yet hypnotically serene, and, at times, devastating in their poignancy: Mesmerizing opener “Floating Leaf” is built upon a gorgeous, countrified guitar line that gradually dissolves into an impressionistic smear, its core melody debased into lingering oscillations that resemble the fragmented images of a dream somberly half-remembered the morning after. </p>
<p>Even though they’re operating within deliberately downsized dimensions and a slim instrumental palette, it never feels like Cashion and Willen are limiting themselves-- the songs here range from a graceful, tiki-torch songs (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15069-blue-elvis/"" target=""_blank"">“Blue Elvis”</a>) that could pass for old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"" target=""_blank"">Galaxie 500</a> bedtracks, to slow-swelling, deeply affective <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"" target=""_blank"">Stars of the Lid</a>-scaled drones (“Believers”), to a stirring cello-driven centerpiece (“Pendelles”, featuring guest Kate Barutha) that hearkens back to the brooding beauty of 90s chamber-rock ensemble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3506-rachels/"" target=""_blank"">Rachel’s</a>. (The duo’s adeptness at exploring different shades of melancholy is so impressive that <i>Walking Field</i>’s more playful counterpoints-- “Tiptoes in the Parlour”, “Lonestar”-- can’t help but feel incongruously slight in comparison.) Even when Peals retrace their steps, it serves as a springboard to somewhere new: “Koan 1” closes the album with a distant echo of “Floating Leaf”, the melody slowed down but rendered more dramatic, thanks to the reemergence of Barutha’s cello and a climactic, triumphant explosion of electric-guitar fireworks. It’s the perfect ending to this spiritual retreat-- one that serves as a celebratory capper to a successful sojourn, while acknowledging that the noise of the big city beckons once again. </p></div>"|18139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18139-peals-walking-field/|7.6|Stuart Berman

Now he records as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29749-case-studies/"" target=""_blank"">Case Studies</a>, a studiously manila folder-blank name. The music he makes is similarly understated, and arguing for its muted virtues can be uphill, unsexy work; if you were a fan of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a> prior to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5719-alligator/"" target=""_blank""><i>Alligator</i></a>, when they were a bleak, Americana-inflected Brooklyn bar band, then Case Studies may hold some appeal-- specifically, the project recalls 2003's <i>Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers.</i></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lortz is an observant songwriter, however, and both <i>This Is Another Life</i> and his previous Case Studies effort,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15764-the-world-is-just-a-shape-to-fill-the-night/"" target=""_blank""><i> The World Is Just a Shape to Fill the Night</i></a>, wear their moroseness handsomely.  <i>This Is Another Life</i> is a writerly album; the sweetly self-effacing, solo-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"" target=""_blank"">Paul-McCartney</a>-reminiscent ""From Richard Brautigan"", a late-album highlight, finds Lortz repurposing Brautigan's bits of wisdom for his lyrics. His plummy, low voice, the most direct and unavoidable connection to the National, draws your attention to the shape of his words and lines and makes some very unattractive sentiments ring with dark beauty: ""And if you have any decency, then you'll pretend to be asleep so I can write/ I've never made an enemy that didn't fall in love with me for a while,"" he moans on ""Passage/ Me in the Dark"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album's sound is similarly mellow and rounded, warmed by lovely upright piano and strings. The arrangements, which Lortz worked out with guitarist and composer Jon Parker, allow for arcing, slide-guitar leads, small embers of Hammond organs, and, on ""Driving East, and Through Her"", even some Keith Richards-style chop chords slide gracefully to the foreground. ""Driving East"", ""Brautigan"", and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"" target=""_blank"">Marissa Nadler</a> duet ""Villain"" prick the album's gray tone, and are the best things on it. ""Driving East""'s modest Southern-boogie steam gives a wry edge to Lortz's doomed-relationship chronicles. ""Those days became some photographs I wish I had not received,"" he sings, affectionately.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the darkness is where Lortz repeatedly returns, and when he does, the album swoons into a near-stasis. Nadler's vocals on ""Villain"" are so welcome, in part, because they offer some relief; otherwise, spending the album's duration in the windows-shut, blinds-drawn parlor of Lortz's mind is pretty suffocating. The focus on Lortz's vocals and lyrics also has the tendency to foreground florid stretches like this, from ""You Say to Me, You Never Have to Ask"", where his pen gets away from him, wildly: ""I have known witches/ I have felt so serene in my veins/ And your lips are whispering spells and your fingers are magical wands."" The record bottoms out with the longeurs of ""The Beast With No Name"", where he sings ""If you were a dove in a cloud of ravens/ Swirling as just one animal/ Would you deliver me safely to your nest in the morning light?"" over weeping strings. The moment lays flat, as does the imagery, and it's where Lortz's project finally crosses the line where ""tasteful"" shades into ""inert.""</p></div>"|18161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18161-case-studies-this-is-another-life/|5.6|Jayson Greene

In the early years of this century, you heard many electronic music aficionados using that phrase, usually in the context of an endorsement. The Scottish brothers Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin didn’t invent a new sound, but they did take various strands of music floating around and pull them into one place and essentially perfect them. And their particular fusion was so distinctive that their name became shorthand. The appetite for the BoC was so voracious that the group’s actual output, which was actually fairly prolific in its first decade, wasn’t nearly enough to satisfy it. But that was a long time ago. Since 2006 we’ve heard a lot of music that seems spiritually connected to Boards of Canada, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a> to chillwave, but we haven’t heard a note of music from the originators until the surprise <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50463-boards-of-canada-new-album-tomorrows-harvest/"">announcement</a> of <i>Tomorrow’s Harvest</i>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">While BoC have always seemed comfortable inside their core sound, their records are still easy to distinguish. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/838-music-has-the-right-to-children/""><i>Music Has the Right to Children</i></a>, they mixed creepy pre-erased drones with childhood nostalgia and drums that drew from hip-hop; on 2002’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/837-geogaddi/""><i>Geogaddi</i></a>, the beats got harder and the unease grew more intense, resulting in an album that was still playful but far darker. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/839-the-campfire-headphase/""><i>Campfire Headphase</i></a>, from 2005, brought acoustic guitars to the table and aimed for a more pastoral feel, but it lacked the tension of what came before. And <i>Tomorrow’s Harves</i>t is in some ways the flipside to <i>Campfire</i>, the bucolic tint swapped out for moody drones and encroaching dread. It is the most internally focused of Boards of Canada’s records. Rather than working around the edges of their sound in search of new territory, <i>Tomorrow’s Harvest</i> finds them drawing back toward the center.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Given its hermetic feel, it makes sense BoC have <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/jun/06/boards-of-canada-become-more-nihilistic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">indicated</a> that soundtracks were an especially big influence. They specifically invoke the work of John Carpenter, Mark Isham, and Wendy Carlos, all of whom constructed some of their most enduring scores in the late 1970s and early 80s. That was a period where analog synthesis was reaching full maturity but digital synthesis was in its earlier stages, when the tape-driven Mellotron competed for studio space with the digital Fairlight and new timbres were being explored. If the earliest Boards of Canada music still seemed inspired by Warp’s post-techno <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11714-artificial-intelligence-artificial-intelligence-ii/"">Artificial Intelligence</a> movement, beats on <i>Tomorrow's Harvest</i> are secondary. The tempos are generally slow, and there’s not much trickiness to the percussion. The tracks tend to create a groove and stick with it for the duration. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The creative energy here is directed toward building textures, which are very deep and rich indeed. The most visceral sound design in Boards of Canada’s music has tended to occur during their short interludes, but here they’ve taken some those ideas and explored them at length, filling the tracks with details that can take some time to soak in. On headphones, you can explore the tracks one motif at a time, as if each were a small landscape. “Jacquard Causeway” has a series of metallic-sounding twinkles that seems to grow out of the chords that swell underneath, and they slip in and out of phase with the underlying drums in a manner that imparts an extra measure of uneasiness. “Split Your Infinities” has bird sounds and distant noises that sound like lasers, both of which are so subtle so as to function subliminally. “Nothing Is Real” is a swirl of deep bass, stop-start drums, and a continual surging synth line that sounds like a swarm of bugs, but it also has a distant, echoing keyboard line that haunts the track like a ghost. The layering of the various sounds on a given track offers a different way in each time, so they can take on an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">M.C. Escher</a>-like quality, where the tone and emotional content varies according to what you choose to pay attention to. There are sounds behind sounds and sounds underneath sounds and you can find yourself sifting through the layers, turning the pieces inside-out. </p>
<p class=""p1"">If Boards of Canada’s sound construction has reached a new plateau, they do seem to have left some appealing elements of their earlier approach behind. Returning again to <i>Music</i> or <i>Geogaddi</i>, it’s striking how tuneful those records were. Whether they’ve lost that ability or no longer choose to incorporate it, melody is not the focus on <i>Tomorrow’s Harvest</i>. These tracks unfurl, grow, and shrink, but they don’t exactly develop, at least not in the same way. The early playfulness, too, is no longer part of the equation. It’s easy to forget about “childlike” for Boards of Canada at one point didn’t just mean the ache of nostalgia or the fear of nightmares but actually pleasurable activities like clapping hands and laughing and saying funny words. And the lightness and humor-- the repetition of the word “Orange” in ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg-iKP0zI9Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aquarius</a>"", say-- are something they don’t seem remotely interested in here. It’s not hard to imagine a certain kind of Boards of Canada fan missing that variety. </p>
<p class=""p1"">So that’s what is not here. What we’re left with is Boards of Canada’s moodiest record, a full-length tinted with atmosphere that unfolds slowly and is happy to allow you to come to it. Creating a new way to hear electronic music, as they did in the first half of their career, earned them that right to make a record that is absorbed through osmosis. And true to its patient nature and long gestation period, <i>Tomorrow’s Harvest</i>’s last third is its best. As they move from the ultra-simple, <i>Music for Films</i>-like “Sundown” through the soot-dusted “New Seeds”, with its quiet guitar grind and bell-like percussion, and then on through the arpeggiated Tangerine Dream-style “Come to Dust” and the the closing bass-pedals of “Semena Mertvykh”, it’s clear that they still, after all this time and all the imitators, own this world. And it’s nice to hear that they’re still inhabiting it.</p></div>"|18104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18104-boards-of-canada-tomorrows-harvest/|8.3|Mark Richardson

Original members Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward staged a splashy press conference in November 2011 to announce a tour and a Rick Rubin-produced album, but the mood quickly soured. Subsequent months brought a lymphoma diagnosis for guitarist and sole consistent member Iommi, a contract dispute involving drummer Ward, high-profile gigs with a fill-in behind the kit, and, finally, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49154-black-sabbath-announce-first-studio-lp-with-ozzy-osbourne-since-1978/"" target=""_blank"">eyebrow-raising news</a> that the comeback LP-- the first full studio record to involve more than two members of Sabbath 1.0 since 1983's Ozzy-less <i>Born Again</i>-- would feature <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3515-rage-against-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Rage Against the Machine</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/165-audioslave/"" target=""_blank"">Audioslave</a> drummer Brad Wilk. The peanut gallery snarked; fans despaired.</p>
<p>That <i>13</i> isn't an out-of-touch embarrassment is a surprise. That it's cohesive, engaging, and even fun is a near-shock. As with most Rubin ventures, the goal from the outset was to help the band recapture their original mojo, the chemistry that made their initial 1970-78 run so brilliant. Does <i>13</i> measure up to classics such as <i>Paranoid</i> and <i>Vol. 4</i>? Of course not. No amount of good intention could recapture the black magic of the band's narcotically enhanced glory days, and while Wilk's performance is sturdy enough, no sub could eclipse Ward, one of the most distinctive rock drummers of the last 40 years and the engine behind Sabbath's signature sludge-blues cadences. But <i>13</i> does offer many of the primal joys that helped immortalize Sabbath in the first place, while documenting the spark that still unites Osbourne, Iommi, and Butler, all three of whom sound about as vital here as anyone could've hoped.</p>
<p>The record's greatest strength is how well it captures the apocalyptic trudge that Sabbath nailed from the very first downbeat of their 1970 debut. The doomy passages in the first two tracks, ""End of the Beginning"" and ""God Is Dead?"", sound stupendously heavy. This isn't just a result of <i>13</i>'s raw production values; it's also that the band is clearly grasping for the same dire emotions (soul-deep malaise, reaper-fearing horror) that fueled their early work, emotions that from the mid-'80s on-- as Iommi carried on under the Sabbath banner with a Wiki-nightmare's worth of collaborators-- have shared album space with less weighty, more pedestrian hard rock. As Iommi, Butler, and Wilk lurch through the titanic riff of ""End of the Beginning"", with Ozzy sneering, ""<i>Reeeeeee</i>-animation of the sequence,"" it's clear that a legacy is being reclaimed. Osbourne, for one, may have squandered any remaining mystique when he opted for reality-TV stardom, but he proves here that he still wields an eerie power at the mic.</p>
<p>The album doesn't fixate on crawling gloom. Early Sabbath is often portrayed as monolithic, but the band's 1970-78 discography was as eclectic in its way as the canons of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"" target=""_blank"">the Beatles</a> or Zeppelin. On <i>13</i>, the band salutes fans with obvious allusions to some of their early outside-the-box classics: sassy midtempo groover ""Loner"" and the faintly cheesy yet improbably moving ballad ""Zeitgeist"" recall ""N.I.B."" and ""Planet Caravan"", respectively. And the sliding-panel, multi-movement structures of ""Age of Reason"" and ""End of the Beginning"" serve as a reminder that the original Sabbath explored their own outlandish brand of progressive rock on later LPs such as 1975's <i>Sabotage</i>. Aside from ""God Is Dead?"", with its plodding, laborious verses, the album's many long tracks feel brisk and hooky.</p>
<p>As sturdy as <i>13</i>'s songs are, the album's signature feature might be its pervasive jamminess. Sabbath were never much for the drawn-out grandstanding of Zeppelin, but they did begin life as a blues band on the nightly grind. The group flaunts those roots constantly on <i>13</i>, in the process spotlighting the partnership that's always been Sabbath's heart and soul: the Iommi/Butler tandem. During triumphant instrumental breakdowns in ""End of the Beginning"" and ""God Is Dead?"", the guitarist and bassist braid together like a heavy-metal Garcia and Lesh, forming a single mercurial mass. Iommi indulges in his share of well-deserved guitar-heroism throughout the record-- most notably on the exuberantly bluesy ""Damaged Soul""-- but with Butler shadowing him, these so-called solos feel more like hive-mind communions. It doesn't hurt that the bass tone on <i>13</i> is extraordinary-- one of the fattest and most gut-churning that Butler has achieved on record.</p>
<p>Offsetting that blood-brother harmony is the odd man out behind the kit. The stiff unaccompanied drum intro to ""Age of Reason"" is just one of many reminders here that Wilk comes from an entirely different school, not to mention generation, than his collaborators. While Rage Against the Machine owed Iommi a significant debt in the riff department, that band's rhythmic orientation had far more to do with crisp funk than blues-based hard rock. (To find a truly sympathetic sub for <i>13</i>, Rubin and the band might have looked to the contemporary doom-metal demimonde, home of drummers like Eyehategod's Joey LaCaze, who specialize in the grimy ooze that powered early Sabbath.) Often, as on the triplet-feel verse section of ""Live Forever"", Wilk sounds like he's trying hard not to mess up. And he doesn't, exactly, but something is lost in the effort. Bill Ward's genius was that he never seemed to care about meeting an objective standard of precision. The early Sabbath drum tracks are riddled with what could technically be described as flubs; they also feature some of the most exhilaratingly earthy percussion rock'n'roll has ever seen.</p>
<p>To be fair, Wilk's appearance was always framed as a sideman gig. (The press materials for <i>13</i> diplomatically state that the band were ""joined at the sessions"" by the drummer.) And there are moments, such as on the sinister strut that opens ""Dear Father"", where Wilk achieves a real chemistry with his elders. Details aside, though, Ward's absence from <i>13</i> shouldn't be glossed over. His shaggy, intuitive swing may have been less commanding than the brontosaurus whomp of John Bonham, but it was no less integral to his band's signature sound. Sabbath has at times weathered their countless personnel shifts gracefully; for example, the lineup featuring late vocal great Ronnie James Dio, eventually billed under the name Heaven &amp; Hell, attained its own special brand of dark majesty. Yet the fact that a full-on original-members reunion was promised and then retracted lends <i>13</i> a whiff of the consolation prize. </p>
<p>In the end, <i>13</i> isn't what every Sabbath die-hard dreamed it might be: a true pick-up-where-they-left-off comeback for the group's founding quartet. But the record does belong in the view of every metalhead-- not just because such a seminal band still deserves obligatory props, but because, imperfections aside, the record embodies the kernel of the original Sabbath idea. That chilling crawl, that low-slung death-blues groove that seemed to come out of nowhere back in 1970, persists here in all its ominous potency, sounding out like an admonition of a genre that's grown increasingly overcalculated and gridlike during the ensuing 40 years, trading tortured humanity for robotic precision. Though fans may resent Black Sabbath for not resolving their personal differences more gracefully, one can't deny the pull of that existential outcry as channeled into what we now know as heavy metal. Their frames might be rusted, but these iron men still walk.</p></div>"|18165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18165-black-sabbath-13/|7.0|Hank Shteamer

The hometown DIY heroes decided to call it quits back in 2011, rounding out their career by recording of the final six songs offered up here, as well as a brief farewell tour. Along for that ride was filmmaker Gabriel DeLoach, who chronicled Double Dagger's last days on the road, cataloging their manic live performances. The resulting footage eventually became the feature-length documentary <i>If We Shout Loud Enough</i> (a DVD of it came bundled with <i>333</i> as a Record Store Day perk), which focused not only on Double Dagger's demise, but the larger story of Baltimore's gritty music scene, featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28423-future-islands/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Future Islands</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5258-dan-deacon/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Dan Deacon</a>, and music historian Tim Kabara, among others, espousing the virtues of Charm City's underground music and arts community. ""Most bands now don't have a personality, they have a haircut. And they don't have a point of view, they have a publicist,"" frontman Nolen Strals <a href=""http://doubledaggerisdead.tumblr.com/trailer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mentions in a trailer for the film</a>. ""I'm happy as hell that you could never say that about Double Dagger.""</p>
<p>Over Double Dagger's nine years of activity, the trio never strayed from their core principles. Musically, things couldn't get much more basic, with Bruce Willen on bass, Denny Bowen on drums, and Strals on vocals. Fundamentally, they were amongst a dwindling number of bands using punk as a soapbox, decrying false prophets, the commodification of art, the hollowness of social climbing, and just about anything else that smelled fishy to them along the way (they're the same band that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8fHejfeYfM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">denounced the futility of a life spent online</a> before Facebook had even been invented). But instead of allowing their slavish adherence to a set of pre-prescribed ethics translating as chilling, Double Dagger used these seemingly simple guidelines to reinforce and strengthen their sound and aesthetic.</p>
<p>As musicians, Double Dagger are rare in their ability to make so much out of so little, with Bowen smashing away at his kit like a pissed off <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_%28comics%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thing</a>, and Willen defying the limitations of what most assume a bass guitar can do, coaxing a wide variation of sounds from his instrument while still (sometimes simultaneously) conjuring an earthquaking thrash. And Strals, alternating between plainspoken rants and throat-ribboning shouts, was often as invaluable as a piece of human projectile as a mouthpiece. (His role as mouthpiece was, in fact, an inspiring one-- having a microphone in his hand was the only real remedy for his pronounced stutter.) You could fault the band for being a bit too preachy, a bit too rigid in their outlook, too smart aleck-y for their own good. But more often than not, Double Dagger did things with such passion, humor and energy, these slight annoyances barely scanned. Plus, they were a band that got better with each release (see 2010's sharpened <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14026-masks-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Masks</i></a> EP for evidence), and <i>333</i> is once again no exception.</p>
<p><i>333</i> is an incredibly personal album, and not only for the obvious reasons. As a band that always found clever ways to circumvent their limitations-- layering memorable and varied melodic hooks underneath their tubular heaviness-- the songs on <i>333</i> take this approach even further, reinforcing their surprising capability of eliciting emotion and transformation. There's still room for classic punk contrarianism here (""Supply/Demand""), but in looking back, Double Dagger really do make the most out of what little time they have left here. ""Foreign Bodies"" takes all the parts of what made these guys interesting-- the grandstanding, the unbridled thrashing joy, the slyly pop-friendly hooks-- and crushes it into a tiny, 160 second diamond. On the knuckle-dragging opener ""The Mirror"", Strals confronts his speech disorder head-on (""When you're up on that stage, you have so much to say/ But when we're face to face, you just can't get it out""), building to a wildly cathartic climax. And with ""Space Dust"", one of two instrumental pieces on the record, things slow to a ruminative pace. Its simple and somewhat discombobulated parts recreate the endorphin sustaining disorientation you might feel leaving a particularly loud rock show, with a mishmash of buzzes and melodies still dancing around your head.</p>
<p>It can't be easy to make a recording when you know it's going to be your last. In a way, imploding acrimoniously might be something of an envious prospect. But expectations aside, <i>333</i> is as good a final document as most bands could ask for, and not of sheer coincidence-- Double Dagger were a thoughtful, hardworking band that found ways to leaven and refresh their sound while still staying true to themselves, and <i>333</i> is that bittersweet piece that completes the puzzle. As a final statement of purpose, there's closer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15288-heretics-hymn/"" target=""_blank"">""Heretic's Hymn""</a>, a scrappy crowd shout-along warning of a future we've long been living in, where we ""banish ideas and only worship what sells."" As the song drifts into a lullabied dirge, Strals makes a final plea: ""I hope you won't forget: You're only free making art outside."" <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/doubledaggerisdead"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Double Dagger is dead</a>, but ""Heretic's Hymn"" is a eulogy that will keep their spirit alive. The fact that it's out there for younger bands to discover is as optimistic a prospect as they could ask for.</p></div>"|17923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17923-double-dagger-333/|7.3|Zach Kelly

After working at a phone bank and spending a little too much time in Austin dive bars, Crane decided to lift himself out of his rut by moving to New York. There, he signed to independent label Dead Oceans and enlisted some Brooklyn-based musicians to record his second record, <i>Saltwater</i>. Informed by the ""transcendent groove music"" of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/"">Fela Kuti</a>, and the contemporary indie rock canon, <i>Saltwater</i> strives to be a buoyant return to form for Crane even as it strays from his original vision.</p>
<p>Before and for a while after Brazos came to be, Crane used to perform with other local artists at a bi-weekly acoustic happy hour at Austin's Beerland. In <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePjA1ZY39Bw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an early video</a> of one such get-together, a bearded, at ease Crane strums his acoustic guitar and crows heartily along with everyone else on stage, playing bar-room country with the same charmingly informal affect that made it onto <a href=""http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Feeding+Frenzy+EP/4870182%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his first EPs</a> under the Brazos moniker. That quality was all but lost on <i>Phosphorescent Blues</i>, which came a few years later. For that record, Crane adopted a backing band and reinvented himself as a troubadour of sorts, citing an <a href=""http://educationliberation.wordpress.com/2010/06/18/the-observer-adrienne-rich/%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Adrienne Rich poem</a> as the album's inspiration, and supplementing-- or more often than not, replacing-- his scruffy, clattering arrangements with the sophisticated rhythms of jazz and bossa nova.</p>
<p><i>Saltwater</i> sees that poem and raises it one <i>Moby Dick</i>, Crane's muse this time around. To flesh out such an ambitious vision, the singer-songwriter enlisted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31145-empress-of/"">Empress Of</a>'s bassist Spencer Zahn and drummer Ian Chang, who plays with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17313-people-get-ready/"">People Get Ready</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/249-matthew-dear/"">Matthew Dear</a>. The new members complement Crane's lyrics, which tend to be heavy on scenes, metaphors, and literary references, with subtle instrumental touches that breathe life into them. On the magnificent ""Charm"", Zahn teases out the lower ranges of a pulsing guitar riff similar to the one buried in labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3475-phosphorescent/"">Phosphorescent</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14661-song-for-zula/"">""Song for Zula""</a> as Chang clicks his sticks with the anticipation of fall's first brittle wind. They adeptly change tacks for the samba-indebted title track, which sees Crane using Ishmael as a character to tell the story of a friend's death. Despite lyrics about night terrors and the cult Japanese film <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rashomon</i></a>, Brazos keep things light with twittering piano notes, a woodblock, and surging choruses.</p>
<p>Brazos' pop-icalia is well-timed for the onset of summer, but it comes at the expense of the homegrown grit that made Brazos' early recordings so appealing, and it doesn't always go down smooth. ""Valencia"" is a cutesy vignette of another one of those quirky girls, hinging on stilted conversation (""Oh, how you look so small from most any eye!"") that not even that woodblock can save. The subsequent ""Deeper Feelings"" sounds like a watery outtake from Local Natives' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17537-hummingbird/""><i>Hummingbird</i></a>, sunk in strangely squelching background synths and moony guitar lines. By the end, <i>Saltwater</i> winds up with impeccably tuned harmonies, lovely melodies, and literally the exact same guitar chords as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a>'s ""Runaway"" opening album closer ""Long Shot"".</p>
<p>At least on <i>Phosphorescent Blues</i>, there were hints of Crane's earlier work in the percussive guitar playing and a voice so threadbare you could hear the grain of it. Now there is little, if anything, left of the Martin Crane that indulged in spontaneous blues licks and wasn't afraid to conclude his bedroom recordings with rambling vocal loops that sound like a drinking song, or like he was just drunk. And that seems to be the way he intended it. <i>Saltwater </i>is a pretty record and the songs are clearly <a href=""http://brazosbrazos.tumblr.com/post/51660061204/message-about-saltwater"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">heavy with personal significance</a>, but it was almost better when they were a little rough around the edges.</p></div>"|18140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18140-brazos-saltwater/|6.3|Harley Brown

It sounds idyllic, in a way, friends literally singing together around a campfire, letting ideas flow, keeping it casual. The resulting record certainly has a rustic, homespun character that reflects its origins, but there’s a lot going on inside this music. Unlike the rest of the wave of desert rock bands that have come out of the Sahara in the last decade, Etran Finatawa’s members are not all Tuareg; half of them are Wodaabe, members of another historically nomadic group with its own language, history and traditions.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">At the time they were recording, the Sahara was turning red. With war in neighboring Mali, religious fighting in northern Nigeria to the south, revolution in Libya, and mounting economic hardship in the band’s home country of Niger, the band’s ostensibly peaceful surroundings in the desert were more like the eye of a storm. What this band’s music reflects is cooperation among members of different cultures whose ways of life are disappearing in the face of modernity, conflict, poverty, and the calcification of borders drawn hundreds of miles from population centers, more or less at random across the long-time travel routes of the people who have lived there for centuries.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The peril of the times calls for a certain immediacy in the music, which the recording conditions amply provide. The sound is as dry as the desert sand, and it can feel as though the music is being made right in the room with you as a result. Voices wailing at maximum power, clapping, and clicking percussion come through especially strongly, while the cycling guitars and other stringed instruments provide a sort of wire for everything to hang on. Some songs were written, others improvised or adapted from folk themes, and they vary considerably in tone. The in-your-ear vocals of “Eldam” cut sharply and have almost too much presence among the other elements, while “Im Raharan” features an almost droning vocal to go with the hypnotic guitar part that thrums beneath it.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Both pieces of music feel like creations of the moment, and they have analogs elsewhere in the 16-song tracklist, which intentionally jumbles all of the different tones captured in the sessions. The fully composed and arranged songs generally come across quite differently, and they are scattered across the album like plot points among action and exposition. Album closer “Toumast” is one of the finest of these, featuring guitars that circle endlessly while the percussion shifts up and down to alter the sense of urgency around what’s being sung in unison by the vocalists.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The details of the politics underlying the songwriting on this album may elude listeners who don’t speak the language (I am no exception there), but the way the recording emphasizes the traditional rhythms and the texture of the voices sends an accessible enough message about the importance of cultural memory. And the band’s very existence as a unit that features close collaboration among musicians from different ethnic backgrounds is its own statement on the conflict in the region; the politics here are at heart a politics of place, and the band headed to the desert to capture the place they consider home, even though they spend their lives moving through it rather than tied to any one piece of it.</p></div>"|18157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18157-etran-finatawa-the-sahara-sessions/|7.1|Joe Tangari

This prejudice is usually based around the idea that anyone who has that much invested in the technical aspects of their preferred instrument has gotten so far up their super-muso ass that there's no emotional engagement in the music itself. Bass maestro Stephen Bruner's found a few ways to avoid that fate: cultivating a sessionman's versatility equally suited to gigs with both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"" target=""_blank"">Erykah Badu</a> and Suicidal Tendencies, aligning himself with the artsy but down-to-earth Brainfeeder community, and, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"" target=""_blank"">Thundercat</a>, putting out solo work that, from the outset of 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15758-the-golden-age-of-apocalypse/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Golden Age of Apocalypse</i></a>, used his chops almost exclusively for a feeling of fidgety joy.</p>
<p>But what's really made Thundercat interesting over the last few years, and what gives his new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>-co-produced album <i>Apocalypse</i> such a kick, is the sense that he's completely divorced his music from any sort of pretense. He doesn't put up some kind of esoteric barrier between the vision of a serious artiste and an unwitting audience that supposedly needs to be schooled on what true musicianship is. He's more dealing with a simple set of ideas, emotions, sentiments, and experiences, elaborated upon in a surprising way. At his best, Thundercat has reversed the evolutionary process where technology, experimentation, and crossover made music more complicated-- instead taking prog and fusion as a starting point to be whittled down, rather than a destination to be built up to.</p>
<p><i>Apocalypse</i> gets immediate real quick. Opener “Tenfold” takes off with the sort of astral-jazz keyboards you might hear on a Lonnie Liston Smith interlude filtered through the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonto's_Expanding_Head_Band#The_TONTO_synthesizer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TONTO synthesizer</a>. But the real pulse is an insistent pounding, chord-blurring 1-2-3-4 hardcore rumble that offsets Bruner's see-saw falsetto, tersely belting out sonic prayers two or three words at a time. It sets the precedent for an album that brings its catchiest tendencies to the forefront and lets the virtuosic stuff in through side channels. What comes up as a whole is this odd but endearing blend of plainspoken nonchalance and almost limitless musical eccentricity.</p>
<p>If that means Thundercat's music feels a little more traditionally song-oriented than before, he's found a way to keep that unpredictable energy of his intact, filtering it through familiar forms of indie R&amp;B (the Mono/Poly coproduced “Heartbreaks + Setbacks”), electronified soul-folk (“Tron Song”, which feels like Terry Callier gone glitch), and bristling, burbling old-school boogie funk (the straightforwardly danceable “Oh Sheit it's X”). The moments of ramped-up rhythmic hustle remain a prominent feature; the shivery rollercoaster arpeggios and hand-cranked forward motion of “The Life Aquatic” and “Seven” have the feel of some enterprising knob-tweaker attempting to electronically retrofit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"" target=""_blank"">the Minutemen</a>'s anxious energy for a Detroit dancefloor. But everything falls together in a way that settles into a steady groove that stays easy to follow and sink into.</p>
<p>The catalyst for this is that Thundercat's voice is more prominent and freewheeling now, as much of a driving factor in every song it appears in as the music backing him up. Where he falls short (but not very) in melodic range, he makes up for in stylistic variance: he's longing and frustrated in “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15295-thundercat-heartbreaks-setbacks/"" target=""_blank"">Heartbreaks + Setbacks</a>”, velvety and dance-drunk on “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15410-oh-sheit-its-x/"" target=""_blank"">Oh Sheit it's X</a>”, sky-gazingly ruminative on “Lotus and the Jondy”, warmly intense and motivational on “Special Stage”. More than ever, it feels like he's writing the instrumentation to fit his voice rather than substitute for or distract from it. And for a series of songs split with a dichotomy of channelling rich, often complex music through an engagingly human voice, the messages are unmistakeable.</p>
<p>The OutRun arcade sunniness of “Special Stage” is a key example: the song's message couldn't be more straightforward but the juxtaposition of simple lyrics and complicated music is the whole point. While there's little that seems quotable on paper, little touches of goofiness and first-thing-that-comes-to-mind spontaneity-- the delivery of his “Your purse is nice, baby, is it leather/ Or could it be suede” pickup line on “Oh Sheit it's X”, or the trip-out “straight up seein' goblins” borderline non-sequitir on “Lotus and the Jondy”-- make him the relatable gravitational center in the midst of a busy intersection of sound.</p>
<p>While much of its musical direction is based on Thundercat's collaborative brainstorming with Flying Lotus, the emotional core of <i>Apocalypse</i> rests either explicitly or implicitly under the shadow of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48682-rip-brainfeeder-affiliate-and-pianist-austin-peralta/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">the late Austin Peralta</a>, the Brainfeeder musician and keyboardist/pianist on many of the songs on <i>Golden Age of the Apocalypse</i>. While there are specifically direct nods to his untimely passing-- most prominently on the elegaic closing suite “A Message for Austin/Praise the Lord/Enter the Void”-- the idea that Peralta's influence and memory runs through the entirety of this album's lifeblood makes a lot of sense. In some way or another, everything on <i>Apocalypse</i> is about taking stock, figuring yourself out, and making sure that the people that mean something to you know that they do. That it arrives through the conduit of somebody who has an elaborate means to express this, but knows when and how to keep things simple? That's how you translate virtuosity into something that hits you right in the heart.</p></div>"|18156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18156-thundercat-apocalypse/|8.2|Nate Patrin

Their songs stick to comfortingly familiar forms, and every single one is about love. Not many bands could build a devoted indie following by plowing such a narrow, unflashy vintage row. But not many bands have a singer like Tracyanne Campbell, whose plainly beautiful voice is sluiced through a series of refined lilts, catches, and gulps that have come to trigger a nearly Pavlovian adoration in fans. This constant musical sweetness is balanced by Campbell's eye for the dark clouds reflected in every silvery lake, and even her most starry-eyed love songs tend to be shot through with presentiments of doom. </p>
<p>Camera Obscura's distinctive outlook on generic terrain becomes apparent only via intimate familiarity, like how every forest trail looks the same except the one you've walked a hundred times. A cursory pass over their catalog might make it sound like all one piece, where a baseline loveliness is spiked with absurdly disarming highlights such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11141-french-navy/"">""French Navy""</a>. But a dogged, calculated growth can be traced from record to record. The folksy early-Belle &amp; Sebastian style of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1749-biggest-bluest-hi-fi/""><i>Biggest Bluest Hi Fi</i></a> (produced by Stuart Murdoch) was perfected, and tinged with dreamy 1950s rock, on the classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1748-underachievers-please-try-harder/""><i>Underachievers Please Try Harder</i></a>. The departure of vocalist John Henderson tilted the band away from cuddly duo songs and toward more lonesome, focused showcases for Campbell's vocal performances on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9077-lets-get-out-of-this-country/""><i>Let's Get Out of This Country</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12942-my-maudlin-career/""><i>My Maudlin Career</i></a>, which<i> </i>bloomed with stronger electric instrumentation and bolder shades of country, orchestral pop, beach music, and soul.</p>
<p><i>Desire Lines</i> is the first Camera Obscura album that doesn't seem to bring much new to the table, though it's hard to complain when they have vocal melodies as infectious and thoughtful as those in the verses of standout ""William’s Heart"". Here, Camera Obscura clear out the symphonic pomp that overgrew <i>Maudlin </i>to double down on classic <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">beach music</a> and soul underpinnings. Jeremy Kittel's strings swoop through a 30-second intro and then out of earshot for most of the album, discreetly reappearing to add translucent harmonies to the stirring ballad ""Cri De Coeur"" and the jubilant deep cut ""I Missed Your Party"", where Motown goes to the sock hop courtesy of a horn arrangement by Mark Gonzales. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/693-neko-case/"">Neko Case</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25867-jim-james/"">Jim James</a> add unpresumptuous vocal harmonies to several tracks, easing into the low-key setting. The flicker and caress of Kenny McKeeve's tastefully reverbed guitar never gets much rowdier than on the rollicking trifle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15298-camera-obscura-do-it-again/"">""Do It Again""</a>-- sadly <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpjILzv1P4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">not a Beach Boys cover</a>, but with some of that same nostalgic feel. There's not a bad cut here, though it's hard to imagine what a bad Camera Obscura cut would sound like at this point.        </p>
<p>It isn't tough to write lyrics about the very beginnings and endings of relationships, when feelings are large and roles are relatively clear-cut. Campbell's gift is to capture the murkier middle regions, especially at transitions or reckonings-- times of acute vulnerability, a quality her voice seems custom-built to transmit. In the first proper song, ""This Is Love (Feels Alright)"", she draws a scenario that is purely flirty and romantic; the kind of helpless, unthinking giving-in that eventually leads to the hard questions posed on the stunning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15472-camera-obscura-fifth-in-line-to-the-throne/"">""Fifth in Line to the Throne""</a>: ""How am I going to tell my king that I don't trust his throne anymore?"" Campbell sings, caught once again, like a moth in a screen door, between staying and going. She's wonderful at lightly sketching the complex dynamics between people who won't say what they both know. ""I've been cool with you,"" she confides on ""New Year's Resolution"". ""The sooner you admit it, I will, too.""</p>
<p>On the same song, Campbell makes two resolutions: to ""write something of value"" and to ""kiss you like I mean it."" The two are directly related for a songwriter who captures hot feelings in cool songs, and perhaps nod to the relatively long four-year wait for <i>Desire Lines</i>. More deeply satisfying than extraordinary<i>, </i>it seems unlikely to displace anyone's favorite Camera Obscura record, but neither is it a negligible entry in one of the smartest and most loveable discographies in contemporary indie-pop.</p></div>"|18185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18185-camera-obscura-desire-lines/|7.5|Brian Howe

It was early 1992, the year after its first reissue by the Chicago label Ajax, who put it out again in 1995.<i> </i>It had originally been released in limited form on casssette by Xpressway, an imprint founded by <span class=""st""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5096-the-dead-c/"" target=""_blank"">the Dead C</a>'s Bruce Russell that </span>I thought of as Flying Nun's weirder, more depressed cousin. I had a radio show at the college station, and looking through a pile of playlist releases, I came across the first Ajax edition with a thumbs up from our Music Director, and I ended up playing the whole thing on the air that night. It's the kind of record that, if it sucks you in, will do so entirely. Think of it, in that sense, as the gnarlier <i>Five Leaves Left</i>.</p>
<p><i>Last Great Challenge</i> is a claustrophobic, private-sounding collection that ranges from homegrown, tinny post-punk to melancholic piano ballads to fucked up tape manipulations to the sound of a man singing calmly (and resignedly) while he does the dishes. As far as New Zealand music in the early 1990s goes, there were poppier groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4392-tall-dwarfs/"" target=""_blank"">Tall Dwarfs</a>, 3Ds, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"" target=""_blank"">the Clean</a>, and the Verlaines. But there was also plenty of noisier material: the Dead C, Wreck Small Speakers on Expensive Stereos, Gate, A Handful of Dust, and other material by Jefferies and his brother Graeme, together as Nocturnal Projections and This Kind of Punishment, and Graeme with his own band as the Cakekitchen. <i>Last Great Challeng</i>e found a space between the two camps.</p>
<p>Because it's so personal, my original sense was that it was the work of an individual. Reading the album credits two decades years later, though, I realized many of the people central to that amazing NZ underground scene were on it. Jefferies <i>did</i> record on a 4-track, but in a studio, not his bedroom, and at various points he's joined by the three members of the Dead C as well as Alastair Galbraith, onetime Verlaine Robbie Yeats, David Mitchell of 3Ds, Nigel Taylor, Kathy Bull, and Robbie Muir.</p>
<p>It's a difficult album to describe because it feels so singular. Opener ""Chain Or Reaction"" is a post punk song, with slashing guitar, piano, and drums behind Jefferies' baritone; it's immediately contrasted by ""Domestica"", the song that finds him crooning about ""throwing it all away"" over the sounds of doing dishes (and then revving up some sort of motor). The piano is his signature-- he plays it like he's punching it-- and when he pairs it with noisy guitars, doubled vocals, and backwards tape loops, the sound is all Jefferies'.</p>
<p>While it's a downcast singer-songwriter collection, even the most hushed moments usually include muffled feedback. And there are occasional psychedelic guitar flairs courtesy of the Dead C (they rage, but remain as quiet as whispers). As bleak as it gets, there's also a kind of tenderness. ""On an Unknown Beach"", for instance, was the tear-jerker then and now. The aching, pretty track, featuring Jefferies alone with his piano, sets the scene of a lonesome winter trek to the beach that comes off, like much of his work, like something bigger: ""My back to the water / My feet in the sand/ Finding no recognition/ As each sign of life/ Invades the precision of this/ Aging land."" In it, he paints one of his most beautiful, and lonesome, images: ""There's a man on the shore line/ With a white parakeet/ Trying to make his/ Bird go home."" It's the kind of visual that sticks with you the moment you hear it; Jefferies has a knack for these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Around the time of the original release, he put out a ""The Fate of the Human Carbine"" b/w ""Catapult"" 7"", which De Stijl includes on this new vinyl reissue. Memory works in a weird way, and I always thought of them as part of the same collection anyhow: The subject matter of his material at this time is dark, and those two songs fold into the tracklist seamlessly. Plus, ""Fate"" is the song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"" target=""_blank"">Cat Power</a> ended up <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDCmIKBdjaI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covering</a> on <i>What Would the Community Think</i> in 1996: Her take was Jefferies' biggest ""crossover"" moment until <a href=""http://amandapalmer.net/blog/finding-peter-jefferies-a-long-story-with-a/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">apparent mega fan Amanda Palmer</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWC0vuA9Ai4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered ""On an Unknown Beach""</a> in 2011.</p>
<p>It's understandable why Chan Marshall and Palmer would be drawn to this work: Like them, Jefferies populates his songs with strong characters and real aches. There are protagonists like the wife who gets up at 6 a.m., has breakfast with her family, then enters an existential void (""Guided Tour of a Well Known Street"") and the character of ""The Fate of the Human Carbine"" who enjoys his time away from his wife before disappearing into his television: ""From six to seven he'll be all alone/ So he turns on television/ Doesn't even notices as is the hours roll by/ Gets lost inside the screen/ Watches the film about the evening sky/ It was someone else's dream.""</p>
<p>Jefferies released four solo albums after this and played in Mecca Normal and 2 Foot Flame with Jean Smith. In New Zealand, he was also a part of Plagal Grind, Cyclops, and collaborations with Shayne Carter, Jono Lonie, and Chris Smith. In 2002, though, he retired from ""professional music."" This makes me think of  a question he asks during ""Domestica"": ""Will anyone be getting old/ Before they throw it all away?"" But it sounds like he's quite content, really: He <a href=""http://www.stratfordpress.co.nz/news/stratford-highs-music-better-ever/1289148/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">teaches high school music</a> (drums, composition, recording) in NZ and plays music for special-needs students once a week. It's a fitting move by someone who wrote a record that has the power to change a life, but still remains relatively unknown. Hopefully this reissue helps shift that.</p></div>"|18058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18058-peter-jefferies-the-last-great-challenge-in-a-dull-world/|8.4|Brandon Stosuy

The St. Louis producer Andrew Jernigan, better known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27922-phaseone/"" target=""_blank"">Phaseone</a>, took advantage of the situation and dropped a head-turning mix called <i>White Collar Crime</i>, on which he ably mashed-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"" target=""_blank"">El-P</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>, and blended <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a> with equal aplomb. Meanwhile, an album of mostly original material released the same year, <i>Thanks But No Thanks,</i> showed that same range and subtlety in what can now be seen as a clear precursor to the electro-cloud style that’s since become so popular. Jernigan was an early prototype of artists as disparate as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30171-lapalux/"" target=""_blank"">Lapalux</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29245-teebs/"" target=""_blank"">Teebs</a>, who make hazy, amorphous music structured like instrumental hip-hop and sourced from multiple genres.</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal"">Four years doesn’t sound like much, but there are now plenty of producers with the range and subtlety to execute the kind of music that Jernigan was making when he came out. And while the new Phaseone album is a tasteful example of the form, it’s still not quite enough to set Jernigan, who now lives in Brooklyn, apart from the pack in the way that those early records did.</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal"">That doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty to like on <i>If I Tell U</i>. Jernigan has moved away from samples, choosing instead to craft similar sounds for himself, and while his hip-hop bona fides are still obvious on an album filled with rap-nerd percussion, there’s not much here that’s particularly upbeat. Instead, we get soothing, zonked out synth-fests like “Hunter” and the flickering “Tangiers”, two of the best tracks on the album. “Hunter” has guest vocals and “Tangiers” has none, but both tracks function as miniature movements, in constant motion even as certain components of the song repeat throughout.</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal"">While there’s something soothing about the loops that Jernigan selects, a minimalist repetition that evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Lopatin</a>’s more peaceful work, his tracks are too tightly structured and have too much body to function as ambient music. This is where a lack of samples really hurts--without that slice of recognizable melody, that earworm to latch on to, many of the most beautiful tracks here are doomed to first grab, then lose the listener’s attention. Take “Kings”: its lo-fi tonal repetition and breathy vocal are perfectly lovely at first, but the loop isn’t sharp enough to sustain attention through repetition alone, and the entire track ends up being forgettable. </p>
<p class=""xmsonormal"">On an album where some compositions are lost to tedium, it might be alarming to see an eight-minute track approaching. But ""Dialogue"" not only validates its running time, but may also hint at a way forward for Jernigan’s music. It's split into four separate sections: a formal, almost classical entrance erupts into a synthetic reinterpretation of a lightshow. Then both vocals and synths are sent through a musical kaleidoscope, waxing and waning before a blurry coda brings things to a halt. Like so many of Jernigan’s pieces, the track is beautiful throughout, but it’s also interesting and unique, a song for listeners to return to and for other producers to take heed of. While much of <i>If I Tell U</i> indicates that the producer might be better off pursuing ambient music with complete conviction or otherwise returning to his polished sample game, a track like “Dialogue” suggests that Phaseone might have more solid musical frontiers to explore yet.</p></div>"|17967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17967-phaseone-if-i-tell-u/|6.5|Jonah Bromwich

It's not an overtly political work, although it is one that illustrates how just about anything can retreat into the margins and become a form of background noise. Lilacs &amp; Champagne are the sample-happy duo of Alex Hall and Emil Amos, who craft this stuff away from their main focus in the instrumental rock act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5356-grails/"">Grails</a>. This is a continuation of the work started on their eponymous 2012 debut, with porn and B-movie dialogue mixed up with studied guitar soloing and a blitz of lounge oriented samples. The title is presumably a reference to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Blue_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Danish Blue</i></a>, a documentary from 1968 that advocated for the legalization of pornography in Denmark. But nothing here seeks to agitate, instead taking outsider art and attempting to expose its soft underbelly.</p>
<p>The references Hall and Amos flip through in their work are an amalgam of the overt and the obscure. ""Alone Again And..."" offers a reduction of the hippy protest dream that makes a titular reference to Arthur Lee's work in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29530-love/"">Love</a>, while the following ""Police Story"" works through familiar emblems from TV cop show themes. But the cut-and-paste nature of their work means it doesn't just hark back to the original source material-- it does it by way of similarly minded 90s artists such as <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Tipsy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tipsy</a> and <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Sukia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sukia</a>, who both had a fondness for piecing tracks together around lounge/exotica samples. The difference here is that this album is a much more passive listening experience, not really inviting the listener to get involved, apparently content to let everything sink into the sidelines. Even an intentional piece of button-pushing dialogue on the title track is barely pushed to the fore. You almost expect someone to leap out and apologise for it being there.</p>
<p>That coy sense of playfulness is a big part of the appeal when Hall and Amos get it right. The expertly disjointed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15062-sour-sweet/"">""Sour/Sweet"" </a>finds beauty in twining peace with chaos, where a scattered drum sample drunkenly lurches into cut-ups of a fresh soul singer. It doesn't belabor the point, getting out in just over two-minutes, offering the perfect distillation of what this band could potentially be. The longer material often gets ponderous, attempting to find a resting ground between psychedelic guitar stokes and something approaching easy listening, but failing to really tap into the power of either. When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> were sourcing artists like <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Esquivel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Esquivel</a> and <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Martin+Denny"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Martin Denny</a>, they primarily recognized the striking sounds they were using, culled from strange percussion tools, odd deviations in dynamics, or a great sway of vocal harmonies. <i>Danish &amp; Blue</i> doesn’t get to that spot, instead settling into being that thing you hum while doing other, more important things.</p>
<p>Hall has <a href=""http://www.mexicansummer.com/shop/lilacs-champagne-danish-blue/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stated</a> that this record is intended to be a ""direct tribute to the musical outsiders of the past,"" which makes a strange fit for the reticence and casual air of the album. In a sense it's a logical next step for the dilution of works that could once have been read as insurrectionary, a further blunting of the knife for anyone who might still be incensed that music by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"">the Clash</a> was used in a jeans ad. Taking that fire and pushing it further into the background, turning it into an approximation of what<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13319-erik-satie/""> Erik Satie</a> wonderfully dubbed ""furniture music,"" feels like an endpoint of sorts, if not a particularly interesting one. But <i>Danish &amp; Blue</i> doesn't come close to either making a statement or reaching into the daze that made their debut so pleasingly disorienting. This is the early-hours sound you nod off to, not the one that has you second guessing what you heard.</p></div>"|18130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18130-lilacs-champagne-danish-blue/|6.3|Nick Neyland

He's played keyboards for Brian Eno, a clear influence, on albums such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14828-small-craft-on-a-milk-sea/""><i>Small Craft on a Milk Sea</i></a>. Tagging along with Eno, he wound up co-producing and performing on Coldplay's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11621-viva-la-vida-or-death-and-all-his-friends/"">fourth album</a>. He also created subtle electro-acoustic atmospheres for the Scottish singer/songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2363-king-creosote/"" target=""_blank"">King Creosote</a> on the exquisite <i>Diamond Mine</i> EP, and crafted an acclaimed string-based score for the British sci-fi film <i>Monsters</i><i>. </i>It's not a shabby CV, but it's not quite a name-making one, either.</p>
<p>This habit of putting himself on the periphery seeped into his own albums-- until now. <i>Insides </i>from 2009 was impressive but felt faintly impersonal, streaming by like dazzling but disconnected vignettes in a film. But Hopkins' breakthrough fourth album, <i>Immunity</i>, bounds and writhes with its own life force. It's looser and oilier, more limber and dangerous. The aggressive dance tracks darkly obliterate everything else, while the wet and sunny piano-ambient ones wash out into the sounds of wind, waves, and gulls. The latter is impeccably done on ""Sun Harmonics"", where the boundary between electronics and coastal recordings dissolves.</p>
<p>Lots of electronic music creates its own hermetic world, but on <i>Immunity</i>, Hopkins finds ingenious ways to let the world in. He created the album's warm, alive feel by shunning digital perfection in favor of the analog synthesis of original sounds, both electronic and physical. The ambient prelude of the haunting, scrambled glitch-house opener ""We Disappear""-- a key unlocks the door of Hopkins' London studio and his footsteps lead in-- is more than idle window dressing: He is ushering us into the tactile space that suffuses the record. He drums on desks, plays salt shakers, slows down serendipitous recordings of nearby fireworks, boosts the kick-drummed rattle of a window. On ""Form By Firelight"", which sounds like <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>'s ""Runaway"" remixed by Wolfgang Voigt, Hopkins processes beats and melodies right out of the piano, tapping the pedals and striking the strings. Spacious, with carefully shaped resonance, its delay-flickered counterpoint shows off Hopkins' classical background.</p>
<p>This emphasis on our admission to a physical space naturally makes us feel like we have privileged access to Hopkins' private emotional space as well. <i>Immunity</i> is said to be inspired by the arc of a night out, and whether or not that matters to the listener, it gives the album a holistic pace and flow, from heroically hurtling along on molten bass synthesziers to hovering gorgeously on gathering ambient breezes. Around the monstrous dancefloor anthems <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15299-open-eye-signal/"">""Open Eye Signal""</a> and ""Collider""-- the first oozing forward in anticipation, the second climactically crashing down at sharp threshing angles-- there is the lyrical ambient landscape of ""Abandon Window"" and the cunning merger of both styles in ""Breathe This Air"". The title track, with a trickle of legato piano turning a rickety rhythm, brings back King Creosote to add discreet vocal colors for a dreamlike conclusion. It all adds up to a remarkably visceral, sensual, confident electronic record that stays absorbing from beginning to end, and should finally catapult Hopkins to stardom in his own story.</p></div>"|18090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18090-jon-hopkins-immunity/|8.5|Brian Howe

His new EP, <i>Still Awake</i> (released out of nowhere for free last week) comes on the heels of three major mixes-- one for <a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/livesetsdjmixes/ryan-hemsworth-diplo-and-friends-sat-05-05-2013/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Diplo and Friends</a>, one for <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2013/02/26/fader-mix-ryan-hemsworth/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fader</a>, and one for <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/luckyme/rinse05"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rinse FM</a>-- a host of loose singles, and a couple of the finely-tuned pop remixes which got him noticed in the first place. But <i>Still Awake</i> finds Hemsworth eschewing his usual stew of radio-friendly samples for a sound both more intimate and more insular. There’s no lingering question behind the title of this EP: it’s a showcase for an omnivorous producer who stays up after everybody else has gone to bed, tasked only with entertaining himself.</p>
<p>Gone are the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"" target=""_blank"">Juicy J</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"" target=""_blank"">Waka</a> hooks, trap drums and associated tomfoolery. Hemsworth’s hip-hop leanings are still present, but they’re put in the service of making elegant miniatures like “(｡◕‿◕｡) (or, I Want to Stare at Your Face Until I Die)”. Dumb name, but it’s a track on which Hemsworth manages to shrink desire down to pocket-size, yearning and plaintive synths all resounding with the same kind of Gameboy fervor.</p>
<p><i>Still Awake</i> feels more well-blended than anything Hemsworth has done, as if his rap, pop, and indie influences are now completely internalized. The samples are deftly woven-- it's not immediately obvious that there’s a lonesome dude moaning below the surface in the first minute of “Empty Thoughts Over a Shallow Ocean”. If the biggest problem with last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17138-last-words/"" target=""_blank""><i>Last Words</i></a> was a lack of cohesion between one track and the next, then consider <i>Still Awake </i>the solution, one on which all songs present are recognizably part of the same project. Even the remix of “Perfectly” that ends the EP-- repurposed as a dyspeptic party jam by the Japanese producer Taquwami-- sounds like Hemsworth giving one of his own tracks his patented remix treatment.</p>
<p>So Hemsworth has found his voice, more evidence of which can be found here in the inclusion of the video game sonics that he loves so much. Earlier this year he contributed a track to a compilation meant to honor the video game composer <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/channel/HCsoMnaYj4bQA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yasunori Mitsuda</a>, and he can often be found on Twitter referencing the sounds of ""Pok<span>é</span>mon"", ""Zelda"" and ""Street Fighter"". “Perfectly”, the strongest track on the EP, uses that arcade sound as a foundation-- a loop of merry provincial chimes keep it grounded as samples flutter by. But all of the tracks on <i>Still Awake</i> use that small sense of scale to great effect. This is bite-sized music with serious emotional punch.</p>
<p>Hemsworth is omnipresent: in the music he releases, his constant touring (he’s on the road with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30453-baauer/"" target=""_blank"">Baauer</a> and R.L. Grime this summer), and loudmouth social media presence. But his own tracks are often wedged into the middle of mixes populated with more famous faces, and live, he’s prone to crowd-pleasing drops and well-mixed, next-level mash-ups, only airing out his latest bedroom craftwork for a minute or so before quickly switching gears. <i>Still Awake</i> shows the flip side of that coin, revealing an introversion that powers the sinking dolor of “track 5 (crashed)” and the intimacy of the understated “All Our Thoughts Are Physical”.</p>
<p>That reticence speaks to the kinds of personalities that inhabit this purple beat scene. Producers like Hemsworth and his close contemporary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28501-shlohmo/"" target=""_blank"">Shlohmo</a> didn’t start making music to be stars, and while both have an affinity for crowd-moving rap and R&amp;B, they shine most when left to their own devices, working with a sensitivity that a fun Backstreet Boys flip only hints at. With his remixes, Hemsworth has shown himself to have a developed understanding of what makes pop music tick. But his database of knowledge and constant musical curiosity is better served when he’s refashioning it into delightful little originals like those found on <i>Still Awake.</i></p></div>"|18152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18152-ryan-hemsworth-still-awake-ep/|7.9|Jonah Bromwich

Last year’s <i>Cosmic Angel</i> showed a dextrous rapper with fury to spare, a whirl of energy when she didn’t drown in her own ambition. After taking on an exhausting and seemingly endless international touring schedule, Blanco has earned a reputation as a powerful live performer. She harnesses this energy well for her first official follow-up, <i>Betty Rubble: The Initiation, </i>an EP-sized prelude to her official debut album that sees her rapping markedly improved.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Initiation</i> starts strong with “Angggry Byrdz”. Like the video game it’s named after, the beat is cartoonish, all plasticky plink-plonk sounds that Blanco pirouettes around with ease. As always, she’s got a bone to pick with, well, everyone, spitting, “Look at them angry birds/ Tryna shit on every word.” If you didn’t already get the feeling that Blanco was automatically defensive about her art, <i>The Initiation</i> makes it pretty damn clear. But in a world where drag queen feistiness is the subject of a popular reality show, Blanco is both caricature and cut-to-the-bone reality. You wouldn't fuck with her.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The rest of the EP is an up-and-down affair that loses the razor focus of its opener. More sprawling than your usual eight-track release, the clumsy experimentalism of <i>Cosmic Angel</i> remains despite Blanco's improved chops. She adopts all kinds of voices, mannerisms, and characteristics, flitting through personalities with the hummingbird hyperactivity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj</a>, especially on “Crisp Clean”, where her distinct rasp is contorted and choked like a crazy straw. Things get druggy and paranoid on the Supreme Cuts-produced “Bugged Out”, while Matrixxman’s “Ace Bougie Chick” is a jaunty summer jam with all the winking charm of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a>’s “Comfortable”. But even this one has a sinister undertone: its playful chorus goes “but you gon’ keep on fucking me/ And nobody has to know,” reminding us of the grim reality that being a gay black man is still an unspeakable position for so many.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Blanco’s rapping is unmistakably stronger, flowing faster and more naturally than ever before, but when she’s not in full force she has trouble keeping getting from point A to point B. The grumbly “Feeling Special” feels like it’s dragging itself from bar to bar, and the rapped-in-Latin title track, while daring, falls a little flat. In typically unusual form, <i>The Initiation</i>’s most engaging track features no actual rapping at all: “Vienna” is simply spoken word over an electro beat. A hilariously detailed story about a tour stop in Austria starring “this waifish Persian pretty boy named Sammy Nagasaki,” it oozes with warmth and humour, qualities that her acid-barbed lashings sometimes lack.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Initiation is </i>a stepping stone for an artist who’s looking increasingly important. Quickly sharpening her stock as a rapper, Mykki Blanco is so much more than the gimmick some have tried to make her out to be. And though <i>The Initiation</i> isn’t turning down any of the camp, it’s a deadly serious manifesto from an artist who wants you to discard your preconceptions and set fire to them. To those familiar with gay culture, Blanco’s outsized aggression is not just welcome, it’s maybe even standard. But there’s a world out there to whom Blanco is an anomaly, a spectacle-- and if she keeps up this ascent, they’re about to be shocked and surprised in exactly the way you begin to sense Quattlebaum wants.</p></div>"|18179.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18179-mykki-blanco-betty-rubble-the-initiation-ep/|7.2|Andrew Ryce

Which isn't a knock: They're a good band, but it's that voice that adds the ""poppy"" to the previous description. It also makes me think more about rock radio than metal. Shi drives home the hooks with an upper register semi-falsetto that's melodic when it needs to be, with an occasional gruffness. It can bring to mind 90s alternative bands (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2166-janes-addiction/"" target=""_blank"">Jane's Addiction</a> with a Southern twang) as well as a skate rock group you caught on a Powell-Peralta video during the early part of same decade (maybe, in part, because Shi resembles Tony Hawk). When he really puts his back into a note, it sounds like he's levitating.</p>
<p>The band's third LP, 2008's <i>Win Us Over</i>, hit me a little after it was released and then became a regular part of my rotation. Their new fourth album, <a href=""http://asgnation.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Blood Drive</i></a>, their first for Relapse, made sense on first listen. The 12-song collection was produced by Grammy-winning engineer Matt Hyde, who's worked with ASG previously. He's also produced albums for Monster Magnet, Sublime, No Doubt, Slayer, Porno for Pyros, and Sum 41, and he knows how to get the big, bright sounds that work best with this band. The quartet aren't afraid of grooves. They don't cower from fist-pumping anthems. It's sunny music that should makes fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"" target=""_blank"">Torche</a> and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"" target=""_blank"">Queens of the Stone Age</a> perk up their ears.</p>
<p>It's not all Shi: ASG know how to write memorable riffs and hooks that really do stick with you. Though they just go by ASG these days, the initials were originally short for All Systems Go, a sentiment that's likely more suited to these guys than whomever sued them way back when and claimed the name for themselves: They pause here and there to insert an acoustic passage, a blues riff, some deep-voiced Americana, or a patch of echoing psych, but for the most part, ASG remain revved up.</p>
<p>The lyrics don't match the usually upbeat sound, and that disconnect helps make the band even more interesting. On <i>Blood Drive</i>, Shi's words often focus on the apocalypse and the sky. We get ""Earthwalk""'s ""All night earth cries beautiful sounds,"" ""Hawkeye""'s ""Lights out we ride/ Tearing holes in a sunken sky,""  ""Stargazin""'s ""Born to ride/ Helplessly into a burning sky,"" and ""Mourning of the Earth""'s ""Roman candles in the sky."" There's also self-mutilation (""I bled for you, come now and bleed for me, too/ Then stitch me up again""), burial (""Spread my remains close by where the weeping willow stood/ I'll be born again""), and plenty of general pain and failure. But it's not melancholic or dour. It's the restlessness of a song like ""Thunder Road"". It's the end of the world in Jane's Addiction's ""Stop"". This is angst you can sing along to while drinking beers in the backyard with your friends.</p>
<p>There's also a punk attitude here. On the radio-hit-in-another-universe title-track, Shi shouts: ""Got a long list of foes and a shorter list of friends."" You get the feeling that this isn't entirely true-- ASG are a likable band who've been around a long time-- but it does feel right in this music, where the emotion is a large part of the appeal. And on ""Blues for Bama"", he sings ""comes as you were"" in a lower, scruffier register before singing it again closer to his usual tone. It's a nice nod to Nirvana, and also entirely fitting: Like Nirvana, this is a rock band that can make us dance to songs about ""a lifetime of shit and disfigurement.""</p></div>"|18082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18082-asg-blood-drive/|7.6|Brandon Stosuy

When he returned to recording and releasing music in 2009 after about a decade away, his sound was just as distinctive-- but this time it was done with acoustic guitar, making his consistency that much more remarkable. Harry Pussy devotees were suitably stoked by this seamless rebirth, but surely in the back of their minds a question lurked: would Orcutt ever go electric again?</p>
<p>The answer was yes-- Orcutt has played electric guitar intermittently over the past four years, both solo and in various collaborations. But <i>The Raw and the Cooked </i>is the first full-length release in which he plays it exclusively. Recorded live last fall during a tour with drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6794-chris-corsano/"">Chris Corsano</a>, the album is a storm of high-speed improvisation, with 12 untitled tracks flying by in just 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Orcutt’s old band favored short blasts too, so another question naturally emerges: does <i>The Raw and the Cooked</i> sound like Harry Pussy? The answer again is yes, but with qualifications. Orcutt certainly echoes his work of decades past, dropping the kind of string-bombs that evoke an amplified car crash. And Corsano’s percussion is so rangy that it inevitably overlaps with the blunt pound of Harry Pussy drummer Adris Hoyos.</p>
<p>But he’s generally more precise and pointillist, with rolls and hits that are frequently jazz-like. That in turn inspires Orcutt toward runs that would work as well on an overblown sax as they do on an over-amped guitar. More importantly, the aims of this duo seem decidedly different from that of Orcutt’s former outfit. Where Harry Pussy often dove toward the deepest end of noise rock,  Corsano and Orcutt seem just a bit more interested in exchange. They’re more inclined to volley their sounds back and forth than jump together into a noise pit.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why <i>The Raw and the Cooked </i>turns out to be much more varied than it initially seems. During my first listen, everything seemed as frantic and blaring as the scorching opener. But repeat visits revealed stretches of restraint and reflection. (That’s something Harry Pussy did well, too, a fact that often gets lost in retrospective depictions of them as a relentless noise factory). The best comes in the album’s longest piece, the 5-minute fifth track, which starts serene before escalating into a sprint. Despite the shifts, at no moment does the tension wane or the adrenaline run out.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that’s <i>The Raw and the Cooked</i>’s main strength. It’s so consistently exhilarating that it matters little whether the pair are playing slow or fast, quite or loud, minimal or maximal; all those modes unite into a single rush. Mapping out the changes and patterns in Orcutt and Corsano’s frantic dialogue is fun in retrospect, but when <i>The Raw and the Cooked </i>is playing, I just want to close my eyes and let it take me wherever it wants to go. </p></div>"|18114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18114-chris-corsano-bill-orcutt-the-raw-and-the-cooked/|7.7|Marc Masters

In a voice that sounds like a perfect cross between Patti Smith, Stephen Malkmus, and a 19th century diction coach, Friedberger spun elaborate, wildly fictional travelogues (usually written by her brother, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4871-matthew-friedberger/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew</a>); in one Fiery Furnaces song she was a Michigan boat captain defending her cargo of blueberries against South Asian pirates; in another she sang in Innuit, and a few songs later she was also a high school queen bee caught in a labyrinthine plot involving credit card theft. Then something unexpected happened with the release of her first solo album, 2011's terrific<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15623-last-summer/""><i> Last Summer</i></a>. She suddenly began to apply that same keen eye for meticulous detail, propulsive narrative, and ironic humor to the one character it seemed she'd never written about before: herself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Last Summer</i><span> was a sharply observed account of Friedberger's first decade or so in New York, where she moved in the early 2000s. At times, its confessional, meticulously detailed lyrics read like ripped-out diary pages, and its brilliance was so sneaky that it was the very definition of a grower. It demonstrated</span> an exciting shift in her songwriting that she continues to explore on her excellent new album, <i>Personal Record</i>. Spinning unexpectedly compelling narratives out of party-hopping New York nights (""When I Knew"") and solitary shut-in afternoons (""My Own World"") alike, the songs on <i>Personal Record</i> feel like travelogues of the mind, entertaining accounts of adventures closer to home. “The last record I did was so specific and detailed,” she said in a recent <a href=""http://rookiemag.com/2013/05/shes-a-mirror/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. “It’s nice to have a record where you can catch a glimpse of the artist and their world, but this time I wanted something where people could insert themselves into it.” She co-wrote <i>Personal Record</i> with a new collaborator, alt-folk singer and novelist John Wesley Harding, and adding another skilled writer to the mix seems to have gotten her out of her own head a bit.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Occasionally, she nails the one-size-fits-all timeless pop lyric: the opening track’s vivid admission, “I’d rather be two inches from your face,” the elegantly sighed, “Love is an exquisite kind of pain/ And oh, since I saw you, I’ll never be happy again.” But memory’s a funny thing; it latches onto the sensory details, even when they’re somebody else’s. “When I Knew” so perfectly captures the excitement of a blossoming friendship between music nerds that the line “We both liked weird music, so you played me Soft Machine,” practically invites you to swap out the specifics for your own favorite band; ditto the scene of the infatuated new lovers reading an e-book in the back of a cab, or the girl curiously dressed as a Dexy’s Midnight Runner for Halloween. Contrary to what she might believe, the more detailed and specific Friedberger’s songs are, the easier it is to insert yourself into them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Personal Record</i><span> is so jam-packed with clever wordplay and fleeting, sometimes contradictory emotions (“I’ll Never Be Happy Again” is followed by the calisthenic skip of “Stare at the Sun”, a song about being dizzyingly happy) that it occasionally feels as much like a short story collection as it does an album. But the tight, buoyant pop arrangements keep it from getting bogged down. Despite Friedberger’s singular phrasing and voice, there’s something inviting and comfortingly familiar about </span><i>Personal Record</i><span>’s approach to pop melody. The great “She’s a Mirror” sounds at once like Hall &amp; Oates covering “Lust for Life” and the Peanuts shuffling to a Harry Nilsson tune-- but its amiable melody and boingy bassline give an easy entry point to a song that's lyrically devious.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like the title </span><i>Personal Record</i><span> itself, Friedberger’s songs use double meaning to great (and sometimes genuinely funny) effect, but they become suddenly poignant in the moments when those defenses fall away. “Other Boys” is one of the most candid, quietly devastating songs she’s ever written: It’s about the kind of casual, open relationship that, secretly, only one of the parties wants to be casual and open. In her ever-confident voice she pantomimes a shrug, but someone who didn’t care about the competition wouldn’t make a list of her guy’s side chicks as poetic and mythologized as the Iliad’s Catalogue of Ships: “The long-tail pony with the thick, dark mane/ 14 hands, four thousand names,” “the spider you kissed in the stairwell,” and the subtly cutting, “that sometime star of stage and screen who had a bit part in a film back in her teens.” “There are other boys, too,” she insists, her about-face betrayed by the slightest tinge of melancholy. With each repetition, the line becomes a little harder to believe, and a little more heartbreaking.</span></p>
<p>Ultimately, though, Friedberger’s self-aware enough to be amused by the irony of confessional songwriting. This becomes explicit on “Singing Time”, <i>Personal Record</i>’s bittersweet finale. Over a muted, aqueous guitar, Friedberger finally lets go of a doomed relationship: “You could turn up late and miss the show, or sit in the middle of the very front row/ He would not know, he would not know.” It’s appropriately downcast until-- in a swell of synth and percussion-- the song suddenly takes flight. “Let’s go, my songs,” she sings, a meta-address that's somehow both playful and self-deprecating. “One day we will know more.” Up until then, the song’s been a tear-jerker, but in this moment it becomes oddly triumphant. It’s hard to think of many other songwriters in indie rock right now who’d be able to pull off that kind of tonal shift-- probably because very few are writing with half the precision, wit, and cool poise that Friedberger displays here.</p></div>"|18096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18096-eleanor-friedberger-personal-record/|8.1|Lindsay Zoladz

Which isn’t a huge problem, since he’s often been welcome on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross"">Rick Ross</a>’ fantasy island. But whereas Rozay has developed a <i>character </i>through vivid imagination and exaggeration<i>,</i> <span class=""il"">Montana</span> doesn’t express enough individuality in his music to even be a caricature.<i> </i>Which <i>itself </i>isn’t a problem, as <span class=""il"">Montana</span>’s emotional blankness puts him within the range of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef"">Chief Keef</a>, but whereas the latter is fueled by nihilistic defiance, French just sounds listless and bored.</p>
<p>The bigger issue is that unlike any of the aforementioned, <span class=""il"">Montana</span> has no real idea of how to put a song together. As proven by “Stay Schemin’"", “I’m a Coke Boy"", “Pop That"", “Shot Caller” or anything else that’s willed its way into becoming a hit, when surrounded by the right team, <span class=""il"">Montana</span> can impress himself on a track without stealing it. But left to his own devices, he raps the same way the guy in your freshman dorm played guitar, absent-mindedly moving from one unrelated riff to the next, fixating on familiar phrasings, and just basically annoying the hell out of you. Some decent one-liners are sprinkled throughout, and somehow, hearing him do his trademark <i>“hah?</i>” is about the only thing that never becomes tiresome. Otherwise, any French <span class=""il"">Montana</span> verse is the sound of time being killed bar by bar.</p>
<p>Nearly a year old, “Pop That” is wisely and somewhat desperately included-- there’s no way <i>Excuse My French </i>will result in anybody’s first-time legal ownership of the song, though you figure its <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98HX5nbsCI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">37 million YouTube views</a> will yield <i>something</i>. Not surprisingly, the noxious lifeblood of “Pop That” courses throughout <i>Excuse My French</i>. Every beat seems to be modeled after it, so whether it’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30552-young-chop/"" target=""_blank"">Young Chop</a>’s domineering synths or Rico Love’s piano-laced and pathos-laden boom bap, it all pounds like Miami bass. Mixed and mastered without nuance or mercy, the relentless blare of <i>Excuse My French</i> becomes a paradoxically ambient experience. Think <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/"" target=""_blank"">Music For Airports</a>, </i>except for situations if you’re engulfed in volume: sitting next to a guy on the subway whose headphones function more like a boombox, trying to have a conversation in a restaurant that allows the decibel level of a nightclub, being stuck in a cab blasting Hot 97 during rush hour traffic.</p>
<p>I can’t verify that <span class=""il"">Montana</span>’s indifference infects the massive roster of <i>Excuse My French </i>any more than I can find concrete scientific proof that yawning is contagious. But the results make the question of correlation or causation a moot point. When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a>’s sexual politics on “Gifted” are somehow less reprehensible than yours, that’s a problem. When “Trap House” finds Rick Ross so disengaged that Birdman manages a more complex rhyme pattern, that’s a problem. When an appearance from ACME-brand rapper Ace Hood feels like the first time in 20 minutes your blockbuster rap album has shown a pulse, that’s a problem. When you decide “Fuck What Happens Tonight” <i>also</i> needs Mavado, a clearly pre-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15158-snoop-lion-no-guns-allowed-ft-drake-and-cori-b/"" target=""_blank"">“No Guns Allowed”</a> Snoop, and a typically authoritative Scarface verse that could not be more out of place, that’s a problem. And when you let DJ Khaled yell at the beginning of that same song to justify his place in the credits, that’s a problem. This is the point in the review where you might expect me to say “this is everything wrong with hip-hop in 2013,” but that might’ve been the case if <i>Excuse My French </i>had sold a ton of copies and could be taken as a mandate for more of the same. Instead, forcing French <span class=""il"">Montana</span> into that #1 spot and having it come off like a transplant rejection actually lets us know the genre’s in fine health.</p></div>"|18178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18178-french-montana-excuse-my-french/|3.5|Ian Cohen

Not really <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28113-alex-bleecker-the-freaks/"" target=""_blank"">Alex Bleeker</a>'s thing. <i>How Far Away</i> is the latest from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a> bassist's other band, the Freaks, a rotating batch of well-wishers that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"" target=""_blank"">Woods</a>' Jarvis Tanviere, Amelia Meath of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28236-mountain-man/"" target=""_blank"">Mountain Man</a>, and Real Estate's own Jackson Pollis. Like its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14044-alex-bleeker-and-the-freaks/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled predecessor</a>, <i>How Far Away</i> is another set of warm, wistful country-tinged rock, somewhere in the neighborhood of the Grateful Dead's <i>American Beauty</i> or maybe Neil Young's <i>Old Ways</i>: unfussily arranged, uninterested in wasting a lot of time. Still, try as he might, Bleeker can't keep a little tension from creeping into the frame; at its heart, <i>How Far Away</i>'s something of a breakup record, although a more easygoing breakup record you won't soon hear.</p>
<p>The rickety, homespun sound of <i>How Far Away</i> is immediately ingratiating, radiating a warmth that helps cut through the sadness nestled into these songs. Compositionally adventurous they're not, but in keeping things moving, Bleeker and company manage to hold most direct comparisons at bay; there's a geniality to Bleeker's Americana I'd associate with the Dead, but his rhythms are far more rigid, his songs less likely to shift course. Still, that good nature makes <i>How Far Away</i> an easy record to play, and then play again; if the last couple minutes of ""Leave On the Light""-- all pedal steel and drunken promises-- were a place a person could live, I'd move in tomorrow.</p>
<p><i>How Far Away</i> certainly sounds inviting, but once inside, you find yourself amidst some emotional clutter. It sees Bleeker and an object of his affection having a time of it; there's a lot of long-distance calls, meaningful looks cast over shoulders, resignation in his voice. Bleeker, in keeping with his simplicity streak, isn't big on metaphor, so quite a few of these songs are direct addresses between him and his troubled love; ""I know it's obvious, my songs are all for you,"" he sings on ""All My Songs"", a sweet plea that underlines <i>How Far Away</i>'s biggest flaw.</p>
<p>Bleeker sets the scene: he's waiting by the phone, his nerves shot, his resolve slipping. But that's typically where the details stop, leaving us with an incomplete picture of person on the other end of the line. You'll certainly get a sense of <i>how</i> Bleeker's feeling throughout <i>How Far Away</i>-- he can't stop talking about it-- but <i>why</i> he's feeling that way is another story entirely. He's never whiny, or pushy, or keen to assign blame; he's just never all that revealing, either, opting to skirt cliché rather than complicating things with specifics. ""My songs will not define my love,"" he sings on ""Home I Love"", and that's just the trouble; between the slight remove in Bleeker's reedy everydude voice and these lyrics' indistinct pining, his music is tough to internalize without playing a little emotional Mad Libs with yourself, squeezing your own particular troubles into the big box Bleeker's provided.</p>
<p>Chances are, though, you'll come away from <i>How Far Away</i> feeling pretty alright about things. Even at his weepiest, Bleeker's good company; Buffalo Springfield-nodding highlight ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15464-alex-bleecker-the-freaks-step-right-up-pour-yourself-some-wine/"" target=""_blank"">Step Right Up (Pour Yourself Some Wine)</a>"" draws you right in, asks how you're doing, rummages around for a clean glass. Bleeker doesn't strike me as a wallower; in fact, he seems like the type who gets over a bad breakup by being around people, not avoiding them. And so he did, reconvening his friends in the Freaks and trying to work through the heartbreak. <i>How Far Away</i> holds its juicy details a little too close to the chest to truly prove cathartic to anybody but Bleeker. But as far as guys talking your ear off about their problems, you could do a lot worse.</p></div>"|18054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18054-alex-bleecker-the-freaks-how-far-away/|6.7|Paul Thompson

Stevie Moore</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2318-chris-knox/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Knox</a>, among others. Now a new vinyl/download set from the label continues the story of the English band, focusing on their work up until the middle of that decade. By this point, the Cleaners were essentially Martin Newell, whose guitar playing, singing, and arrangements balanced a sense of genteel pop-rock as refracted from the late 60s with the rough-and-ready explosion of DIY tape releases. But the real story, already an undercurrent on the earlier releases, was the sense of sadness and unease that pinned down the cheeriest-seeming songs, often reflecting a time of political and social despair as Margaret Thatcher’s government continued in office.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>In</i><i> the Golden</i> <i>Autumn</i>, released in 1983,<i> </i>was the first Cleaners album to be released following the departure of co-founder Lol Elliott. The sensation conjured up in the title carried through songs with titles like “The Autumn Cornfield”, all bird sounds, child’s voices, and piano against a calm beat, and the concluding mock-live-at-the-lounge breeziness of “A Fool Like You”, where even the soaring sax break seems to underscore the refrain, “She’ll never love a fool a like you.” “Ghosts in Doorways” and the accusatory “Krugerrand Gladiators” felt even starker, however hook-laden-- the rich feeling in the guitars on the former contrasting lyrics like “Now you’ll wake alone/ In the golden autumn.” Throughout, the overall feeling of immediacy and using what there was at hand remains key-- liberal echo's featured heavily, but is just as dispensed with entirely.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Under Wartime Conditions</i> followed in 1984, simply subtitled as ""a collection of pop songs."" Newell hadn’t suddenly gone pro by any means-- there were faint degrees of progression in the slightly clearer arrangements and more complicated instrumental passages. If anything, it proved his most enjoyably rollicking record yet, evidenced by the the drum-heavy boogie of “Hand of Stone” and the frenetic instrumental “Fracas on West Street”, a jam where the Cleaners bordered on shredding. If there was more depth and variety to the muffled beats on the opening “Summer in a Small Town”-- as close as the Cleaners got to funk-- the introductory chatter, barbed expressions of contentment, and roughly textured vocals would definitely trace Newell’s increasingly parallel path towards that of future collaborator Andy Partridge of XTC. Meanwhile a tip of the hat to a mutual inspiration (also noting the perils of fandom) with “Song for Syd Barrett” once again showed Newell's propensity for lyrics that intially read as bucolic and pastoral, but revealed themselves to be questioning and uneasy. For instance, from “Johnny the Moondog Is Dead”: “They kill the good guys off in history/ And tomorrow, who will the unicorn be?”</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Songs for a Fallow Land</i>, the Cleaners’ 1985 offering, shifts back into murkier mode with the opening “Sun Comes to the Wood”. Newell’s singing on the chorus has a slippery ease to it, a suggestion of another new balance found after a steady five years of work under the name. Sterling musical moments like the simple in-construction guitar breaks on “Julie Profumo” and the quick and just as quickly dispensed-with Beatles nod on “Heroin Clones” abound throughout. Themes of isolation and sudden connection continue to provide a deep anchor at many points-- “Gamma Ray Blue” is one of the sharper critiques of mass media impact on emotion out there, and certainly no less relevant in an Internet generation, while “Stars Are Cold”, is stripped down to piano, bass and beats, and reminiscences about being caught up in ones memories. Meanwhile the echo and space on “Soul Monday” is almost as post-punk as the band ever got, while the bells on “Winter Place 2” accentuate the group’s facility with instrumentals in turn.</p>
<p>After all this, hearing Newell himself introduce <i>A Dawn Chorus: Early Cleaners and Beyond</i> with a quick chat asking us to ""take a break from the normal proceedings of jangly pop for a minute"" is a fun treat. He then plays a snippet of a song recorded in his garage with relatives and friends at the tender age of 12. From there it’s a sampling of otherwise unreleased tracks from 1980 to 1986, ranging from full band efforts to solo recordings. There’s a sense of turning over the years, whether accidentally or by coincidence: the gentle Beatles/power pop swing of songs like “Bon Temps Roulez” leads on to songs with titles like “When Fire Burns Dreams”, addressing the all-too-real nuclear war fears of the time, and beginning with a riff on <i>West Side Story</i> that concludes “Do what we’re told by America.” “Young Jobless” captures that perfect sense of peppiness in the sound, rough recording in the engineering and deeply dark sentiments in the lyrics, a portrayal of post-academic employment failure that rings true 30 years on. Meanwhile, “It’s Been So Long” puts together the same combination with a focus on romantic frustration and yearning. Concluding with a take on the old Jeannette MacDonald chestnut “Beyond the Blue Horizon” that’s both great fun and just as yearning as the many originals, it’s a fine way to conclude another strong set from this remarkable act.</p></div>"|17610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17610-cleaners-from-venus-in-the-golden-autumn-under-wartime-conditions-songs-for-a-fallow-land/|7.7|Ned Raggett

Stevie Moore</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2318-chris-knox/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Knox</a>, among others. Now a new vinyl/download set from the label continues the story of the English band, focusing on their work up until the middle of that decade. By this point, the Cleaners were essentially Martin Newell, whose guitar playing, singing, and arrangements balanced a sense of genteel pop-rock as refracted from the late 60s with the rough-and-ready explosion of DIY tape releases. But the real story, already an undercurrent on the earlier releases, was the sense of sadness and unease that pinned down the cheeriest-seeming songs, often reflecting a time of political and social despair as Margaret Thatcher’s government continued in office.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>In</i><i> the Golden</i> <i>Autumn</i>, released in 1983,<i> </i>was the first Cleaners album to be released following the departure of co-founder Lol Elliott. The sensation conjured up in the title carried through songs with titles like “The Autumn Cornfield”, all bird sounds, child’s voices, and piano against a calm beat, and the concluding mock-live-at-the-lounge breeziness of “A Fool Like You”, where even the soaring sax break seems to underscore the refrain, “She’ll never love a fool a like you.” “Ghosts in Doorways” and the accusatory “Krugerrand Gladiators” felt even starker, however hook-laden-- the rich feeling in the guitars on the former contrasting lyrics like “Now you’ll wake alone/ In the golden autumn.” Throughout, the overall feeling of immediacy and using what there was at hand remains key-- liberal echo's featured heavily, but is just as dispensed with entirely.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Under Wartime Conditions</i> followed in 1984, simply subtitled as ""a collection of pop songs."" Newell hadn’t suddenly gone pro by any means-- there were faint degrees of progression in the slightly clearer arrangements and more complicated instrumental passages. If anything, it proved his most enjoyably rollicking record yet, evidenced by the the drum-heavy boogie of “Hand of Stone” and the frenetic instrumental “Fracas on West Street”, a jam where the Cleaners bordered on shredding. If there was more depth and variety to the muffled beats on the opening “Summer in a Small Town”-- as close as the Cleaners got to funk-- the introductory chatter, barbed expressions of contentment, and roughly textured vocals would definitely trace Newell’s increasingly parallel path towards that of future collaborator Andy Partridge of XTC. Meanwhile a tip of the hat to a mutual inspiration (also noting the perils of fandom) with “Song for Syd Barrett” once again showed Newell's propensity for lyrics that intially read as bucolic and pastoral, but revealed themselves to be questioning and uneasy. For instance, from “Johnny the Moondog Is Dead”: “They kill the good guys off in history/ And tomorrow, who will the unicorn be?”</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Songs for a Fallow Land</i>, the Cleaners’ 1985 offering, shifts back into murkier mode with the opening “Sun Comes to the Wood”. Newell’s singing on the chorus has a slippery ease to it, a suggestion of another new balance found after a steady five years of work under the name. Sterling musical moments like the simple in-construction guitar breaks on “Julie Profumo” and the quick and just as quickly dispensed-with Beatles nod on “Heroin Clones” abound throughout. Themes of isolation and sudden connection continue to provide a deep anchor at many points-- “Gamma Ray Blue” is one of the sharper critiques of mass media impact on emotion out there, and certainly no less relevant in an Internet generation, while “Stars Are Cold”, is stripped down to piano, bass and beats, and reminiscences about being caught up in ones memories. Meanwhile the echo and space on “Soul Monday” is almost as post-punk as the band ever got, while the bells on “Winter Place 2” accentuate the group’s facility with instrumentals in turn.</p>
<p>After all this, hearing Newell himself introduce <i>A Dawn Chorus: Early Cleaners and Beyond</i> with a quick chat asking us to ""take a break from the normal proceedings of jangly pop for a minute"" is a fun treat. He then plays a snippet of a song recorded in his garage with relatives and friends at the tender age of 12. From there it’s a sampling of otherwise unreleased tracks from 1980 to 1986, ranging from full band efforts to solo recordings. There’s a sense of turning over the years, whether accidentally or by coincidence: the gentle Beatles/power pop swing of songs like “Bon Temps Roulez” leads on to songs with titles like “When Fire Burns Dreams”, addressing the all-too-real nuclear war fears of the time, and beginning with a riff on <i>West Side Story</i> that concludes “Do what we’re told by America.” “Young Jobless” captures that perfect sense of peppiness in the sound, rough recording in the engineering and deeply dark sentiments in the lyrics, a portrayal of post-academic employment failure that rings true 30 years on. Meanwhile, “It’s Been So Long” puts together the same combination with a focus on romantic frustration and yearning. Concluding with a take on the old Jeannette MacDonald chestnut “Beyond the Blue Horizon” that’s both great fun and just as yearning as the many originals, it’s a fine way to conclude another strong set from this remarkable act.</p></div>"|17610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17610-cleaners-from-venus-in-the-golden-autumn-under-wartime-conditions-songs-for-a-fallow-land/|7.1|Ned Raggett

His online presence, however, reveals a bit more; his <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fthechildoflov.tumblr.com%2F&amp;ei=Ts-rUc6ZItO04AOi1ICgBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFEf8mawBsTic06dpQRhVs7srPZ_A&amp;sig2=cz9RuRQKGn06Zr1LmlRnSA&amp;bvm=bv.47244034,d.dmg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tumblr</a> tells us that he counts early-00s American R&amp;B, Woody Allen movies, and pictures of beautiful famous women eating nachos as interests. We also learn that he is a self-styled reclusive perfectionist. He recently posted <a href=""http://thechildoflov.tumblr.com/post/51583160306"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a note </a>explaining to his fans that he will not be touring live in the near future, despite “pressure” to accept spots at Glastonbury, Bestival, and others. “I’m a perfectionist, and I want to translate my music to a live setting the most perfect way imaginable, because I firmly and religiously believe that is what my music deserves,” he wrote.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His self-titled debut album also tells us a lot about Williams. Within 30 seconds of opening track “Call Me Up” it’s immediately clear that he has a specific spiritual forebear for his get-it-right-or-not-at-all stance. His vocals are muttering, multi-stacked, and closely harmonized, buried in the cellar of a mix crawling with dirty, brambled, bluesy sounds-- church organ, hard <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"" target=""_blank"">RZA</a> drum loops, electric guitar licks. In short, he sounds in the grip of an all-consuming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/"" target=""_blank"">D’Angelo</a> obsession and <i>The Child of Lov</i> music made by someone who has listened to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17407-voodoo/"" target=""_blank""><i>Voodoo</i></a> every day for the past decade.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">He’s learned some useful things from his <a href=""http://www.geekexchange.com/geek-music-my-collection-the-child-of-lov-55529.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">deep study</a>. Williams has a wonderful ear for thick sounds, and has manipulated every instrument, whether it’s the dying-fluorescent-bulb synths worming through “Living the Circle” the glumly echoing surf-guitar licks of “One Day”, or nylon acoustic guitar strings underpinning “Owl”. His voice, in the mix, sounds like it is drowning in, or emerging from, a vat of burbling tar. He has worked on some of this music, he has said in interviews, since he was 15 years old, and you can hear it, in a good way: Each track glows with the warmth of William’s smudge marks and eraser scuffs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The thing about <i>Voodoo</i>, of course, is that that album’s mercurial, flickering spirit is so dim and private that it seems to exist independently of the music itself, and scraping the patina off the album’s surface, as Williams does here, doesn’t leave him with much of his own to work with. The brightest spots are toward the end; he channels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a> on “Warrior” in a surprisingly clean, uncluttered, and devotional ballad.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It should be noted that Williams has gathered some high-profile guests around him: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"" target=""_blank"">Damon Albarn</a>, who probably also recognized a Gorillaz-sized footprint on Williams’ psyche, shows up to sing some wispy background vocals on “One Day”. And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27670-doom/"" target=""_blank"">DOOM</a>, not an easy guy to pin down, shows up to spit some of his perfect, gnomic bars over “Owl”. But they don’t do much to change the overall sense that <i>The Child of Lov</i> is a sound-not-the-spirit affair. After a few listens, the novelty wears off and its charms flush from the system. Williams has figured out his sounds, but he’s still working towards his voice.</p></div>"|18155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18155-the-child-of-lov-the-child-of-lov/|6.1|Jayson Greene

These records gained notice for recontextualizing the sounds of dance's various sub-genres-- disco, dubstep, house, and more-- into pop-leaning structures. The latest addition to this list is <i>Settle</i>, the brilliant debut album by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">Disclosure</a>. The Surrey duo have not only made 2013's best dance record so far-- they've also concocted one of the most assured, confident debuts from any genre in recent memory. That they've done so on a major-label record that's absolutely loaded with guest spots-- these are typically red flags when approaching any dance full-length with crossover potential-- is nothing short of a miracle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The brothers behind Disclosure, Howard and Guy Lawrence, seem impossibly young considering their talents: Guy is 21, while younger brother Howard just turned 18 a few weeks ago. But they've actually been on the scene for three years, and their artistic growth over that period is impressive. Back in 2010, Disclosure first emerged on the blog circuit's nether regions with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14151-street-light-chronicle/"" target=""_blank"">""Street Light Chronicle""</a>, a slice of competent, indistinct bass music that sounded like what you'd expect from a pair that have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9012-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">cited</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10877-untrue/"" target=""_blank"">Burial's <i>Untrue</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11461-hyph-mngo/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Orbison's ""Hyph Mngo""</a> as their gateways into club fare. With every succeeding release, however, Disclosure rapidly moved away from ""Street Light Chronicle""'s weatherbeaten greys towards a smoother, brighter sound. Last year's fantastic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13189-running-disclosure-remix/"" target=""_blank"">remix of Jessie Ware's ""Running""</a> greatly increased both artists' profiles; earlier this year, Disclosure's collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30260-alunageorge/"" target=""_blank"">AlunaGeorge</a> singer Aluna Francis, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14797-white-noise-ft-alunageorge/"" target=""_blank"">""White Noise""</a>, rocketed to #2 on the UK Singles chart two weeks after its release. Clearly, they've come a long way in a short time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A number of tracks from Disclosure's earlier releases would be considered highlights on any debut album. Two of them, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13458-boiling-ft-sinead-harnett/"" target=""_blank"">""Boiling""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13602-whats-in-your-head/"" target=""_blank"">""What's in Your Head""</a>, from the enjoyable 2011 EP <i>The Face</i>, are relegated to bonus track status on <i>Settle</i>'s deluxe edition. That such strong material didn't make the album proper speaks to its high quality. Over its hour-long runtime, <i>Settle</i> features an masterful sense of pacing, from the jacking propulsion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15525-disclosure-when-a-fire-starts-to-burn/"" target=""_blank"">""When a Fire Starts to Burn""</a> to the album's sweeping closer, ""Help Me Lose My Mind"". Dance music's long had a fickle relationship with the album format, but Settle's impeccable sequencing leads to an album that begs to be heard in its entirety.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Settle</i>'s playful, high-energy attitude is sometimes reminiscent of <i>Remedy</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/300-basement-jaxx/"" target=""_blank"">Basement Jaxx</a>'s star-making 1999 debut. The duos share divisive tendencies: Jaxx's brash and hyper-active production style rubs some the wrong way, and Disclosure have been called out for their clear debt to established UK dance styles. Specifically, Disclosure have been charged with riding the resurgence of the syncopated, R&amp;B-infused gait of late 1990s/early 2000s 2-step and UK Garage touchstones like MJ Cole's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy-djtiU5RE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sincere</a>"" and Hardrive's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRH05Nq_JI0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Deep Inside</a>""; last month, they released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15391-artful-dodger-no-i-turn-you-on-disclosure-remix-ft-zoe-kypri/"" target=""_blank"">an answer-song remix</a> of 2-step kings <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXhp10X09XA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Artful Dodger's ""Please Don't Turn Me On""</a>-- and this after after UKG veteran <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14224-el-b/"" target=""_blank"">El-B</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14503-boiling-el-b-remix-ft-sinead-harnett/"" target=""_blank"">offered his own dusty take on ""Boiling""</a> late last year, making the inspiration explicit.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The skepticism is understandable, to a point. UK dance culture has long prided itself on pushing things forward, and Disclosure's arrival on the scene-- not to mention bass music's current retro-fixated house excursions-- marks the first time in many years that the freshest dance sounds from across the pond sound a little second-hand. Ultimately though, complaining about young artists reviving sounds that they weren't around to experience the first time around is futile. We're a few years into an era where talented musicians are discovering influences new and old not through direct interaction with scenes but through their computers. And when the execution is this accomplished, it's hard to get too hung up on the source material. Some of <i>Settle</i>'s giddiest highlights are clear UKG callbacks-- ""Voices"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50480-watch-disclosures-you-me-video/"" target=""_blank"">""You &amp; Me""</a>, especially-- but Disclosure refuse to stick to any single genre. They effortlessly spin through romantic house (""Defeated No More"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50928-listen-disclosure-f-for-you/"" target=""_blank"">""F For You""</a>), pitch-screwed bass music (""Second Chance""), and raunchy grime-inflected motifs (""Confess to Me""); nothing is off limits, and <i>Settle</i> is all the better for it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For all its dance trappings, <i>Settle</i> is a pop record first and foremost, one that feels remarkably inclusive. The handful of male-led vocal cuts range from solid (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26767-friendly-fires/"" target=""_blank"">Friendly Fires</a> vocalist Ed MacFarlane's sultry take on ""Defeated No More"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29297-jamie-woon/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie Woon</a>'s emotive pleading on ""January"") to showstopping (the indelible, effusive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14188-latch-ft-sam-smith/"" target=""_blank"">""Latch""</a>, Howard Lawrence's surprisingly effective turn on ""F for You""), but <i>Settle</i>'s array of female voices are the record's nucleus. While a few notable names are used in surprising fashion-- folk-pop singer Lianne La Havas' effusive, bleated samples on ""Stimulation"", Jessie Ware's muted moves on ""Confess to Me""-- the biggest star turns come from up-and-comers like Sasha Keable and London Grammar's Hannah Reid, who shares a co-writing credit on ""Help Me Lose My Mind"". While listening to <i>Settle</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44141-echo-chamber-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake's 2011 quote about U.S. dubstep's ""frat-boy market""</a> came to mind; in 2013, it could be argued that such aggressively chauvinistic attitudes pervade many areas of big-tent dance culture, and it's hard not to hear <i>Settle</i>'s wide-reaching accessibility as a potential antidote to the trend.</p>
<p>Skirting dance's more bass-heavy strands, Disclosure take a spare approach to sampling throughout <i>Settle</i>. They lift a few stray sounds from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYsqgScbPp4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kelis</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duEy80T-wLg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Slum Village</a> and, most curiously, motivational speaker and self-proclaimed ""hip-hop preacher"" <a href=""http://etinspires.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eric Thomas</a>, whose impassioned delivery is featured on the album's intro as well as ""When a Fire Starts to Burn"". The video for the latter brings the sample to life visually and it turns out to be a strange reflection of its source material. As was <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/disclosure-when-a-fire-starts-to-burn-settle-video/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently noted</a>, dance music's history contains frequent intersections, ideological and otherwise, with religion. Much like when dance-pop alchemists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"" target=""_blank"">Hot Chip</a> released their own devotional to the dancefloor in the form of last year's stellar <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16706-in-our-heads/"" target=""_blank"">In Our Heads</a></i>, <i>Settle</i>'s appeal ultimately owes something to its spiritual tinge. Disclosure's unabashed pop sensibilities speak to the notion that music, as with a system of beliefs, can bring a diverse array of people-- the dance nerds and the poptimists, the club denizens and the festival obsessives, the perpetually stylish and the utterly clueless-- together as one. <i>Settle</i> is an album-length articulation of this idea, and it's hard not to believe in that.</p></div>"|18091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18091-disclosure-settle/|9.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

They started life as a glam-derived metal band, for which they were dismissed by the same people who embraced Seattle’s other big glam-derived metal band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22273-mother-love-bone/"">Mother Love Bone</a>. Layne Staley’s drug metaphors and horror-show vocals made hits out of “Man in the Box” and “Would?” but he could often sound self-satisfied regarding his addictions, which ultimately made it difficult for them to tour. If Alice in Chains staked its popularity on the still-vital <i>Dirt </i>in 1992, they maintained it with an <i>MTV Unplugged</i> album. As a band, they never possessed the metal chops of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3885-soundgarden/"">Soundgarden</a>, or the arena-punk populism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"">Pearl Jam</a>, or the self-torturing sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>. As an influence on subsequent bands, they are arguably responsible for mook-metal acts like Puddle of Mudd, codifying self-absorption as a viable rock'n'roll stance.</p>
<p>Even after Staley’s OD in 2002, it’s no real surprise that Alice in Chains are still around-- there’s always cash in nostalgia-- but it is a surprise that the band's latest album actually sounds like they're trying to move forward rather than rest on their dubious laurels. Despite its very 1990s red jewel case and its trollable title, <i>The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here</i> is actually a solid mainstream rock album: more inventive than it needs to be, and less self-congratulatory in its intense introspection. That’s due to new vocalist William DuVall, who approximates Staley's blared sneer but actually has more expressive range. And mostly it’s due to Jerry Cantrell, the guitar player, chief songwriter, and arguably the brains behind the band for 20 years now.</p>
<p>In 2009, this new line-up made the tortured-but-determined <i>Black Gives Way to Blue</i>, which lacked the desperation of a typical comeback record. In retrospect, that album sounds like a warm-up for <i>Dinosaurs</i>, which sounds more confident and concentrated than its predecessor. The hooks sounds more insistent, the guitars grind harder, and the songwriting sounds almost extroverted at times. The title track is one of Alice in Chains’ most politicized songs to date, a God’s-eye-view of religious extremism in America and a quick glimpse back at the spiritual doubts that infected “Man in the Box”. “The devil put dinosaurs here,” DuVall sings as the guitars quake and rumble, as though the bottom were falling out of the song. “No problem with faith, just fear.”</p>
<p>That song is six-and-a-half minutes long. It doesn’t need to be. Chop it in half and you could double its impact. But the same could be said of just about any track on <i>Dinosaurs</i>, which typically lumber past the five-minute mark. The result is an album that feels much longer than its bloated 70 minutes, that often buries its best moments, that exhausts its most intriguing ideas either by stretching them out or simply repeating them. On the other hand, <i>Dinosaurs</i> actually does have some intriguing ideas to exhaust, mostly about how you play mainstream rock in 2013. Rather than foreground crunching guitars, “Pretty Done” and “Voices” build their riffs piecemeal out of bent and tortured notes that fit together in jigsaw fashion. The technique approximates melody but conveys mood precisely. That’s what makes first single “Stone” so effective: You’re a full minute or so in before you realize just how smart and menacing its central guitar riff is, or how it slyly establishes an atmosphere of subtle aggression.</p>
<p>In other words, Alice in Chains would rather sneak up on you than attack you with blunt force. That serves a fairly boilerplate anthem like “Scalpel” especially well as it builds quickly from an acoustic intro to an extroverted chorus that in concert likely prompts a few raised lighters. On the other hand, <i>Dinosaurs </i>loses some of its stomp toward the end, with the by-the-numbers “Phantom Limb” and the plodding “Hung on a Hook” sounding more like what you’d expect from Alice in Chains 20 years after their heyday. So it’s as insistent as <i>Dirt</i>, but it’s also not as superfluous as, for example, Soundgarden’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17300-king-animal/"">recent reunion record</a>.

David Corney’s production style pulls drum patterns from hip-hop and micro-genres of dance, and grooves along the sort of 1980s synth palette that inspires skipping wanderlust instead of dark-cornered club moves. In interviews the DJ earnestly explains that the exploratory landscapes found in his music are a direct result of specific visions; his 2011 solo debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15370-broadcast/"" target=""_blank""><i>Broadcast</i></a> was fashioned around the reverberant sounds of an empty city at night. <i>Modern Worship</i> holds a distanced but telescopic gaze upon the same concreted jungle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A few aesthetic elements have stayed with Hyetal since he first started making waves in 2009. He has always favored the texturalization of contemporary beats, often accompanied by a glossy sheen with traces of a slowly developed melody. But where <i>Broadcast</i> was more atmospheric and watercolor-like, <i>Modern Worship</i> is a sharper, more clearly drawn picture. Here are purposeful stints of two-step, or footwork, or bursts of the type of sub-bass and skittering tension that his peers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22787-peverelist/"" target=""_blank"">Peverelist</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31347-kowton/"" target=""_blank"">Kowton</a> would be proud of, aggressively pushed to the fore. His punches hit harder; on “Lake Rider” a waterfall of chimes drift into a mass of echoes, every new melodic phrase piercing through the last. “Jam the Network” uses stabby, inflated reverb to force the song along. Throwback videogame samples are looped into mocking, futuristic lightshows on “Forefathers” and “1000 Lights”, with a frenzied flair that’s not so different from that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With all of his IDM tricks and dream pop worship, Corney’s sound often feels like it reaches for a broader and more deliberate pop agenda. When trying too hard to get there, he sometimes falls into a trap of synthy sameness; it’s his weirder moments that succeed. <i>Broadcast</i><i>’s</i> standout track “Phoenix” could have been an under-the-radar hat-tip to ""Miami Vice""’s iconic theme song. As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30967-velour/"" target=""_blank"">Velour</a>, his dance outfit with fellow Bristol producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29346-julio-bashmore/"" target=""_blank"">Julio Bashmore</a>, he flipped an EP of purple-tinted boogie: “Booty Slammer” sampled the tiniest snippet of Whitney Houston’s “So Emotional”. Neither of those tracks felt as easily suited for a dancefloor as they were roadtrips and headphones. Similarly, the best of <i>Modern Worship</i> comes when collaborative vocalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30580-gwilym-gold/"" target=""_blank"">Gwilym Gold</a> appears (on “Northwest Passage” and “Left”) and the singer’s vague, romantic croons offer the most engaging and emotionally poignant moments on the album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s possible that some of what seems like a confident stride towards the future on <i>Modern Worship</i> is simply a change in Corney’s equilibrium; subtle progressions are less revered than in the past, drums are crisper, synths shine brighter, and vocalists wade through instrumentals instead of singing on top of them. It recalls a certain era of pop ideals: New Order’s early synth pop ambitions and the alt-rock dreaminess of Cocteau Twins are the first to come to mind when met with “Northwest Passage” or “The City Is Ours”, where vocalist Alison Garner serves alongside Gold in an Elizabeth Fraser-style role. Hyetal has a firm grasp on his spin of sweeping, beat-infected sentimentality, and <i>Modern Worship</i> is strong enough to see him lead a crowd, or keep dancing on his own.</p></div>"|18081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18081-hyetal-modern-worship/|7.0|Puja Patel

Wasif, still probably best known for his work with the <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"" target=""_blank"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>, and McBean-- of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/584-black-mountain/"" target=""_blank"">Black Mountain</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27380-pink-mountaintops/"" target=""_blank"">Pink Mountaintops</a>-- are collaborators at heart. Their new project, so-called ""New Acoustic Death Folk"" ensemble <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31384-grim-tower/"" target=""_blank"">Grim Tower</a>, got its start in McBean's backyard as he and Wasif strummed away an afternoon on a bunch of curiously detuned guitars. Alongside Rob Barbato and Dan Allaire-- rhythm section of L.A. droners <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24519-darker-my-love/"" target=""_blank"">Darker My Love</a>-- Wasif and McBean fleshed out those initial back patio tapes into the meditative thrum of <i>Anarchic Breezes</i>.</p>
<p>Where transcendence is concerned, <i>Anarchic Breezes</i> talks a good game; lyrically, you've got your cities in the clouds, your soothsayer-encircled pyramids, pretty standard takeaways from one mystical journey or another. The playing's beautiful, rich and unshowy, as impressive in its technique as its reserve. The title track, a delicate, instinctive duet, might be the best thing here, their playing at once meticulous and moving; McBean's ""Let Death Become Your Comfort"", its guitars wavering in the heat like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5199-tinariwen/"" target=""_blank"">Tinariwen</a>, is a close second. Produced by McBean and Rob Campanella of the Quarter After and mixed by Mark Nevers in Nashville, it's a gorgeous recording, crisp and spacious, with just the right amount of embellishment. The trouble is in the songs. Most of <i>Anarchic Breezes</i> unfurls slowly, solemnly even, their droning strums and delicate fingerpicking eventually giving way to weighty choruses about the nature of things before retreating into the ether. Between its all-too-deliberate pace and McBean and Wasif's unusually graven delivery, <i>Anarchic Breezes</i> is kind of a slog; The spontaneity that initially sparked these songs is long gone, replaced with a kind of every-note-in-place perfection that doesn't exactly get the blood going.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Breezes</i>' occasionally exacting music is a far easier pill to swallow than its pie-eyed lyrics. Wasif, in particular, seems a bit lost amidst the tangerine trees and marmalade skies: as if the Egyptian time-traveler who spends his days ""talking pyramids and getting stoned"" in ""All the Beautiful Things"" weren't enough, the songs centers around a sorta-chorus of ""get hiiiiigh."" ""Blue"", though less explicitly moony, still manages to grate, imparting a kind of wisdom that confuses more than it clarifies: ""Circle dot, circle dot,"" goes its unhelpful chorus, ""You can't give what you ain't got."" McBean, for his part, gets in a few ruminations on mortality that at least give you a little more to chew on. Even so, ""Leaving My Old Life Behind"" finds him above the clouds, beyond the sun, using physical highness as a metaphor for, well, you know. Even the less druggy stuff is delivered in something like hushed tones, lending the whole thing a ""this'll blow your mind"" portentousness that doesn't quite sit right with the less-than-mindblowing revelations they've brought back from beyond the bardo.</p>
<p><i>Anarchic Breezes</i> is in many ways a modest record, charting out a few very specific music ideas in a thoughtful, if not exactly dazzling, fashion. <span>It's beautiful, but rigidly so; hypnotic, but without the kind of intensity that'll hold you rapt, more about gathering energies than letting them loose.</span> On their higher-profile releases, Wasif and McBean have proven themselves to be quite good at making grand gestures in their music seem huge without teetering over into grandiosity. Grim Tower turns that balance upside down, the ponderous nature of its lyrics overpowering the subtleties of its music. <i>Anarchic Breezes</i> does open up a bit after a few listens, but I'm still not entirely sure that's a good thing; with every spin, the music seems to grow more delicate, which just sends all those Castenada-core lyrics into starker relief. Occasionally plodding, and too ruminative by half, <i>Anarchic Breezes</i> is a journey in need of a destination, stuck between staring at the sun and gazing thoughtfully at its own navel.</p></div>"|18136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18136-grim-tower-anarchic-breezes/|5.3|Paul Thompson

Over their short existence, Brooklyn-based duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30627-beacon/"" target=""_blank"">Beacon</a>-- comprised of vocalist and producer Thomas Mullarney and producer Jacob Gossett-- have staked out their own corner R&amp;B by imbuing pristinely constructed, slow-burning ballads with the murky, bass-blaring darkness of trip-hop and Warp Records' output ca. the early 1990s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Their first two EPs arrived on Ghostly International in late 2012-- <i>No Body</i>, originally released on Moodgadget in 2011, in August and <i>For Now</i> in October-- and showcased a handful of shimmering, anti-love songs reverberating with cavernous production and Mullarney’s chilly croon, which shapeshifted from sensual to toxically dominant from one line to the next. <i>No Body</i> and <i>For Now</i> also made it apparent that the duo’s vision was diamond-sharp right out of the gate; similar to Abel Tesfaye’s narcotic disillusionment as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a>, they wanted to plumb the searing emotional damage and existential fallout from the desperate need for love through the lens of a genre usually reserved for passionate, sexual yearning. There’s a friction that’s generated from twisting R&amp;B’s usual forms into something considerably more lurid and ambiguous that was evident in the song “No Body”, the first EP’s highlight, when Mullarney coos the casually sinister refrain, “I’ll follow you home, so you won’t be alone.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">And now, with their first full length album <i>The Ways We Separate, </i>Beacon attempt to narrow in tighter on a particular kind of romantic wreckage, using their expansive, ravey R&amp;B to focus on the ways in which we grow together and grow apart, connecting and disconnecting, over and over. It isn’t so much a breakup album as a document of the emotional decay and guilt that arrives when the bonds forged in a relationship become noxious. Sonically, Mullarney and Gosset have pushed their atmospheric, bass-heavy compositions into larger spaces, building off the template they constructed for the quiet disintegration of “Feeling’s Gone”, the lone track from the EPs to make the album. Here, the duo have crafted syncopated webs of keyboards, interspersed with distorted breakbeats, to circle Mullarney’s breathy tenor as he sketches a last ditch grasp at reconciliation that has since soured into cheap sexual dependence: “The feeling’s gone/ You waited for too long/ But if you just stayed tonight/ We could find some more.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Feeling’s Gone” is part of the album’s strong opening phalanx, which in turn makes <i>Ways</i> feel a little frontloaded. “Bring You Back” glimmers with cascading synth arpeggios that slowly coalesce into a cacophony of clockwork chimes, even while Mullarney skirts around murky lyrics that never manage to harden for emotional impact. The tar-black trip-hop duet of “Drive” and “Between the Waves” both recall the low, dark rumble of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"" target=""_blank"">Massive Attack</a>’s <i>Mezzanine</i> with Mullarney’s vocals even hovering around the same register as Horace Andy, the Bristol group’s frequent collaborator. “Between the Waves” in particular slowly brews into a thick storm system of spiraling bass whomps, skittering drum hits, and trancey, seasick synths, as Mullarney digs through the resignation of a coupling that has slowly faded into oblivion, struggling against the numb inertia of indifference as if it’s a rip tide: “Of all the ways we separate/ Where we start to fade at different frequencies/ I could compensate, try to fill the space/ Only to suffocate between the waves.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">The album’s second half suffers slightly simply because it seems like Mullarney and Gosset run out of fuel for their intense slow burn, with the production, melodies, and lyrics not quite matching the inventiveness, and emotional wallop, of <i>Ways’</i> opening salvo. The disjointed malaise and lyrical opacity of “Studio Audience” along with the undeniably pretty but slight “Headlights” (which ends up sounding like a wilted xx cover) both seem dormant compared to the quiet, devastating ruptures of “Between the Waves” and “Feeling’s Gone”. Regardless of the inconsistencies, <i>The Ways We Separate</i> still leaves its mark. With three releases in the past eight months alone, it’s exciting to watch as Thomas Mullarney and Jacob Gosset continue to sharpen their vision, using their dark, slickly composed R&amp;B to explore the treacherous rifts and chasms that gradually form in human relationships.</p></div>"|18142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18142-beacon-the-ways-we-separate/|6.8|Patrick Bowman

But Homme can get away with it because the status quo he’s referring to could easily be his own band. Since launching Queens of the Stone Age from the ashes of the almighty Kyuss in 1998, Homme has treated hard rock and metal as soluble materials; his band’s music is mercurial, its membership highly fluid.</p>
<p>By QOTSA's unconventional standards, a six-year layoff between albums doesn’t even feel like an unusually long hiatus, but more like the natural amount of time it takes for a new incarnation of this ever-shifting band to settle into place. Of course, Homme was never far from the headlines in the interim: He’s done everything from form <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28149-them-crooked-vultures/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">a new band</a> with a member of Led Zeppelin to produce an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13374-humbug/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">underrated Arctic Monkeys record</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;""> to <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/queens-of-the-stone-age/54615"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">survive a near-death experience</a></span>. Along the way, the Queens have shed long-time members (Joey Castillo, whose departure was announced partway through the ...<i>Like Clockwork</i> sessions; he appears on four tracks) and reacquainted themselves with some old friends: <i>Songs For the Deaf</i>-era sticksman Dave Grohl, go-to growler Mark Lanegan, and, most surprisingly, Nick Oliveri, who was ousted from the band in 2004 (and in the ensuing years, narrowly avoided jail time for domestic violence, drugs, and firearm-related offences). All the while, Homme lined up a guest list for ...<i>Like Clockwork</i><i>--</i> including Scissor Sisters' Jake Shears, Arctic Monkeys’ Alex Turner, U.N.K.L.E.'s James Lavelle, and even Sir Elton John-- that threatened to make the band’s previous revolving-door records seem grossly under-populated.</p>
<p>But if all that suggests a return to the scatterbrained lunacy of the band’s early-2000s releases-- and the band’s exodus from Interscope to Matador would seemingly encourage a left-field foray-- ...<i>Like Clockwork</i> presents another curveball<b>.</b> Queens of the Stone Age’s first album for an indie since their debut is actually more polished and melodically focused than anything they ever released on a major<b>;</b> you’d be hard pressed to classify 80 per cent of it as hard rock. But ...<i>Like Clockwork</i> simply foregrounds an aspect that’s been lingering in the Queens’ music since the beginning: beneath all that volcanic riffage, Homme has always been a sucker for a pretty pop song.</p>
<p>Queens have flashed their softer side before-- see: <i>Rated R</i>’s “In the Fade”, or <i>Era Vulgaris</i>’ “Make It Witchu”-- but there’s always been a self-consciousness about their slow jams, like someone not unsubtly dimming the lights and pretending to stretch their arm to sidle up closer to their date. ...<i>Like Clockwork</i>, however, is more committed in its intent to invest the Queens with extra grandeur and grace, and all of the aforementioned guests are essentially accomplices in Homme’s regal aspirations. (In other words, you’ll need liner notes to figure out most of the cameos). And don’t expect any party-crashing intrusions like “Quick and to the Pointless” from Oliveri; his duties don’t extend beyond backing vocals on a few tracks, as if his return to the group is on a probationary basis.</p>
<p>Fittingly for a band that’s spent the past few years retooling itself, it takes some time for Queens to shake off the cobwebs and get back to full strength: The leaden, one-note trudge of “Keep Your Eyes Peeled” makes for a rather listless re-introduction, ""I Sat By the Ocean"" doesn't fully deliver on the seedy promise of its ""Telegram Sam"" strut, while “The Vampyre of Time and Memory” strains too hard in its attempt at an early-70s John Lennon piano ballad. But like Jack White (with whom Homme occasionally <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27647-the-dead-weather/"" target=""_blank"">shares custody</a> of keyboardist Dean Fertita), Homme knows how to reinvigorate well-worn classic-rock influences by filtering them through his peculiar personality, and this is where <i>...Like Clockwork</i> really comes alive: The monstrous groove of “If I Had a Tail” imagines how Zeppelin would have turned out if they had survived disco, while the moonage-daydreamy verses of “Kalopsia” are deviously upended by a Ziggy-wiggy, stardust-covered crunch. Bowie looms large on another album highlight: “Smooth Sailing”-- the song of load-blowing bravado-- assumes a <i>Scary Monsters</i>-style robo-funk bounce to bolster brilliantly nonsensical lines like, “I’ve got bruises and hickeys, stiches and scars/ Got my own theme music, plays wherever I are.”</p>
<p>Queens haven’t fully abandoned brawn and ballast (combustible lead single “My God Is the Sun” is up to their usual paint-stripping standards), but those qualities are now being harnessed for greater emotional impact, particularly on the penultimate “I Appear Missing”. It's a power ballad that perfectly bridges the divide between Queens’ hard and soft extremes, pitting Homme’s crestfallen melody against a sleeping giant of a chorus that proves to be as raging as anything in the band’s repertoire; when Homme shifts to falsetto for the song’s calamitous closing minute, it’s less a show of cheekiness than vulnerability. Homme initially chose his band name to subvert the machismo inherent to hard rock and<b>,</b> more than any of their records before it, <i>...Like Clockwork</i> feels like the ultimate realization of that mission. To invoke <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcDEmNDYW8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an old glam proverb</a>, it kicks like a mule even when it dresses like a queen.</p></div>"|18087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18087-queens-of-the-stone-age-like-clockwork/|7.3|Stuart Berman

Since raising their profile considerably after the breakthrough album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/""><i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i></a> and maintaining that amount of accessibility on the subsequent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13739-fall-be-kind-ep/""><i>Fall Be Kind</i></a> EP, the material Animal Collective have released since-- from the “visual album” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7888-gift-guide-2010/""><i>ODDSAC</i></a> to the live box <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13072-animal-crack-box/""><i>Animal Crack Box</i></a> to the solo efforts from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15299-tomboy/"">Panda Bear</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14764-down-there/"">Avey Tare</a>-- has not pandered. And <i>Centipede Hz</i> continued the trend, taking the band’s most distinctive elements-- yelping vocals, busy production-- and amplifying them.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Every Animal Collective full-length since Sung Tongs has been followed by a companion EP. A couple of these, like <i>Fall Be Kind</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/192-prospect-hummer-ep/""><i>Prospect Hummer</i></a>, rank among the highlights in Animal Collective’s catalogue. Others, like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9818-people-ep/""><i>People</i></a> EP and this one, feel very much like an assemblage of bonus cuts meant for the group’s biggest fans. Where <i>People</i> was padded with both a studio and live version of the title track, <i>Monkey Been to Burn Town</i> is a collection of four remixes, three of <i>Centipede</i>’s “Monkey Riches” and a version of “New Town Burnout” by Shabazz Palaces.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">One of the challenges of <i>Centipede</i> was the dense, midrange-heavy production, so a couple of tracks on Monkey give you a chance to hear the song with a different backdrop. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27880-teengirl-fantasy/"">Teengirl Fantasy</a> remix of “Monkey Riches” isn’t exactly minimal, but there is a certain amount of space and clarity in their bright electronic mix, and it leans toward bass. So the hook of the song’s central refrain seems just a little catchier, and lately when I imagine the song this is the version that sticks into my head. Brian DeGraw of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"">Gang Gang Dance</a> applies his band’s feel for industrial funk to the song. It’s even leaner and more stripped down, with a lopping slide guitar riff and a stop-start 2-step beat, but he seems to be listening to what the song is doing and finds appropriate tweaks to its verse/chorus dynamics. Finally, Chicago-based footwork producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30360-traxman/"">Traxman</a> offers the most radical interpretation of the three, upping the tempo and adding a 4/4 thump and turning a few of the song’s original elements into a ghostly swirl that serves mostly as a tint for the beats. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Once in a while a remix comes along that changes how you hear a song or makes you want to reach for it rather than the original; none of these get there. But the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28847-shabazz-palaces/"">Shabazz Palaces</a> version of “New Town Burnout” has the advantage of being basically a cover/extension rather than a remix. So Shabazz Palaces’ Ishmael Butler voices Panda Bear’s words and turns them into a downcast gothic chant as snippets from the song are re-arranged, and then he takes the song much further out, with new lyrics and a new refrain. The Shabazz Palaces cut is easily the most interesting song here, and seems to be the one you might still be pulling out once in a while in another six months. Considering that the EP, with three versions of the same song in a row, isn’t really meant to be heard as a whole, getting one truly intriguing track out of it isn’t such a bad deal. </p></div>"|18137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18137-animal-collective-monkey-been-to-burntown-ep/|6.7|Mark Richardson

But now here comes <i>Once I Was An Eagle</i>, the first of her albums to sound like a vigorously polished, hard-won achievement. It’s expansive and ambitious, and divorced of all the tweedy preening and aw-shucks raggediness the idea of “folk” has accumulated in recent years. It's dark, it’s angry, it’s even sexy, in a sly, subtle way.</p>
<p><i>Once I Was An Eagle</i> marks another, more literal departure: Making the record in producer Ethan John’s countryside studio was one of Marling's last acts as a full-time Brit. Whether she had plotted her move from London to Los Angeles before she wrote the album isn’t clear, but either way these 16 songs bear witness to the process, embodying the particular catharsis that comes from moving house, the existential tumult that so often accompanies the dismantlement of a material life, all that sifting through the detritus of past and current lives. She digs deep into the far-back grimy corners of herself, examines every scrap and trinket, fully weighs each of the thousand tiny decisions about what to throw out and what to drag along to the new address. (<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/apr/28/laura-marling-interview-once-eagle"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In reality</a>, she took barely any of her possessions to LA.)</p>
<p>This could be called a concept album, or a breakup record, though neither quite seems to suffice; “emotional bildungsroman” comes close, “scorching self-interrogation about the possibility of happiness and unpoisoned human connection in the wake of one or more failed or failing relationships, carried out under the ever-present pall of mortality,” maybe closer. As a lyricist, Marling has always favored a veiled sort of storytelling, her songs never not deeply felt but always more in the vein of short stories than memoir, and executed so supremely that sussing out the “real” from the “unreal” has always seemed beside the point. But this one feels personal in ways the others haven’t; the “I” of the songs is not always clear, as always, but seems closer than ever to being Marling’s own self.</p>
<p><i>Eagle</i> was made over 10 days, with just a cellist and Johns (on carefully-placed drums, piano, organ) providing accompaniment; Marling recorded her vocal and guitar parts in a single take each, and in one day, though it somehow sounds even more immediate. Present in both her singing and her playing is a ferocity that now seems to have been lurking there all along; at times, too, she’s possessed by a newly emergent serenity, and an astonishing ability to shift between the two modes. This is especially evident on <i>Eagle</i>’s opening tracks, four songs written as a proper suite and a fifth that feels equally of a piece. Together they seamlessly, almost imperceptibly, build from somnambulant finger-picked acoustic to a wild fury of howling cello and frantic tabla-style percussion, “Take the Night Off” leading it off the way a rainshower usually precedes a hurricane; by “Master Hunter”, the suite's cap, Marling is inhaling relationships and spitting them back out as heaving piles of splinters and ash.</p>
<p>The rest of the album is spent digging through the rubble, out of which creatures and names and scraps of ideas turn up over and over: birds and beasts, the devil, water-- and, most prominently, the unnamed “you.” All through <i>Eagle</i>’s first half, this seems to be the same person, the same man: her “freewheeling troubadour,” the dove to her eagle. Some amount of drama has transpired offstage, though the specifics are not made clear, are perhaps too mundane to bother with; what's extraordinary is how Marling handles the fallout. On these songs she interrogates him, indicts him, admits her own cruelty towards him, always stopping short of apology, not even allowing herself to playact the rites of guilt.</p>
<p>Later, after the sparse chill of “Interlude”, the perspective shifts, the cast widens. “Where Can I Go?” obliquely introduces Rosie, a figure perhaps understandable as some fragment of who Marling might have been before all this began. On “Little Bird”, loping with the immense grace of Nick Drake, Marling questions the girl, or herself: “Why did you run from everyone who only tried to love you, Rosie?” Meeting this seemingly crucial, recurring character so late in the song cycle is a jarring development; then again, perhaps that’s the point, to echo the shock of the the singer finding herself again, bloodied but alive at the bottom of all the wreckage.</p>
<p>By this point, the album is circling itself, or the idea of its former self, as if waiting for the thing to die. Bits of “I Was an Eagle” return in “Pray for Me”-- the “preying” becomes “praying”; the climbing and swooping riff, there edged with a sitar-like guitar effect, here just simply thumbed along. Something heavy has been shaken off; some light is breaking through. “You asked me blind once/ If I was a child once/ And I said I’m really not sure,” Marling sang way back on third track “You Know”, in the dusky murmur she increasingly favors; now she finally has a reply, or finally lets herself reply: “I was a child once/ Oh, I was happy young/ When all I didn’t know needed doing had been done.” The question-asker is long gone; Marling doesn’t answer for his sake, but for her own.</p>
<p>Knotting up that loose end seems to make the final quarter of the album possible-- that realization of what needs to be done, and then the doing of it; putting away childish things, which, in the end, seems <i>Eagle</i>’s core concern. “Thank you naivety, for saving me again/ He was my next verse,” Marling nearly barks, on the last track, over a mounting wall of what seems like every instrumental bit to appear on the previous 15 tracks: all that warm cello, palm-hammered percussion, billowing organ, and her steady, spangling guitar. The mess of love, of hate, has been sorted through, purged, sorted and packed away-- not entirely tidily, and not in a way that could protect against any future disasters, but enough for a fresh start somewhere else. Marling is 23; at first, the amount of time she had spent on this earth seemed relevant because nobody in her peer group was making albums like this. With <i>Once I Was an Eagle</i>, it’s because nobody of any age is making albums like this.</p></div>"|18066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18066-laura-marling-once-i-was-an-eagle/|8.1|Rachael Maddux

The first is that they excel at a kind of jangly, chiming, and softly anthemic iteration of indie rock that made a lot of television music supervisors’ jobs easier in the mid-2000s. The other is that the Oakland band has incredibly shitty luck. Rogue Wave does everything earnestly, and in the last couple of years, they’ve tried in earnest to shed these reputations. And they’ve not found much success. <span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">On ""Chicago x 12,"" a single </span>from 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10667-asleep-at-heavens-gate/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Asleep at Heaven's Gate</a>, </i>Zach Rogue expressed the dissonance between his band's critical acclaim and their demoralizing tours with one heartbreaking line: ""it don't matter/cause no one comes out to see us."" More pointedly, 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13887-permalight/""><i>Permalight </i></a>was a slick dance-pop rebranding, an admirable strategy that unfortunately played to none of the band's strengths and created no new ones. Newly signed to Vagrant Records, <i>Nightingale Floors </i>arrives with Rogue Wave bearing acceptance of who they are: they’ve made a good record of jangly, chiming, and softly anthemic indie rock. And in 2013, that makes it a record with exceptionally poor timing.</p>
<p>Opener “No Magnatone” serves as a mission statement for <i>Nightingale Floors </i>even if doesn’t actually say very much. It’s a wisp of a song, little more than a ringing guitar figure and Zach Rogue’s soft, strangely enunciated vocals moving together in shuffle time. It lets you know Rogue Wave have readjusted their mechanics and, immediately after, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15211-college/"">“College”</a> proves to be the first time they’ve truly connected in years. It bears all the characteristics of Rogue Wave’s slightly cracked and wholly tuneful past highlights: snappy, major key melodies disguising depressive lyrics, enthusiastic strummed acoustic guitars backing singing electric leads, verse-chorus structures nudged by off-kilter time signatures. <i>Nightingale Floors </i>positions itself as the logical next step for Rogue Wave had the ill-fated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13887-permalight/"" target=""_blank""><i>Permalight </i></a>been replaced by <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15632-come-back-to-us"">Come Back to Us</a></i><i>, </i>the solo album Rogue put out in 2011 as Release the Sunbird. The gorgeous, kinda mushy “The Closer I Get” hearkens back to <i>Come Back</i>’s emotionally and instrumentally naked folk pop and serves as a retroactive advertisement for an album that mostly went overlooked.</p>
<p>John Congleton’s typically holistic and crisp production forces Rogue Wave to ensure the underlying song structures of “Siren’s Song” and “Used to It” can support their ambitions of multi-tiered builds and swelling crescendos. They succeed in those instances, but elsewhere, you’re reminded that <i>Asleep at Heaven's Gate</i>'s<i> </i>weaknesses weren’t just a result of puffy production or unmet arena-rock aspirations. As Rogue continually dials down the tempos or broadens song length, he hasn't compensated for them with melody; even the quieter, acoustic moments on Rogue Wave’s first two records were briskly performed, so even if they didn’t pop, they at least fizzed. Eight-minute closer “Everyone Wants to Be You” aside, <i>Nightingale Floors </i>is compact and centered enough to avoid drift; it just goes through enough unmemorable, mid-tempo patches to remind you why so many listeners and artists sought out more rhythmically exciting sounds at a time when post-Shins indie rock loomed large.</p>
<p>It’d be unfair to judge <i>Nightingale Floors </i>within the context of prevailing trends that are out of Rogue Wave’s control if they it didn’t appear to be such a pervasive concern for Zach Rogue himself. How could they not be? “The gravity of career ambition/ Never meant that much to me,” Rogue shrugs on “Figured it Out”, though it would appear there’s an implication of denial. The occasional hints at familial disappointments on “Used to It”, unfulfilled ambitions on “College”, and resigned acceptance elsewhere suggest Rogue hasn’t lost his self-awareness, that being themselves probably won’t make Rogue Wave any bigger than they were when they wrote “Chicago x12”. But maybe the rooms will be smaller and the crowds more appreciative. <i>Nightingale Floors </i>isn’t a confessional, nor is it a cry for help, but an attempt to be the acceptance Rogue wants to see in the world-- a modest record of modest aims from a songwriter coming to terms with his current station.</p></div>"|18094.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18094-rogue-wave-nightingale-floors/|6.3|Ian Cohen

For more than a decade, the band has often functioned as a pinball ricocheting between musical enthusiasms with delightful unpredictability. Initially a jazz band, they’ve since shot between psychedelic and progressive rock, spasmodic noise and iron-fisted metal, ostensibly directed by little more than mercury and whimsy.</p>
<p>After four albums, though, 2010’s radical<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14215-blackjazz/"" target=""_blank""><i> Blackjazz</i>­</a>-- their public and aesthetic breakthrough, all at once-- showed that their path had been, if not deliberate, then not without its instructive moments. That previous decade, <i>Blackjazz </i>proclaimed, had been one of stepwise accretion, where all the heavy metal and free jazz, long-form experiments and stylistic adventures had gathered around the core of charismatic producer and frontman Jørgen Munkeby and pliable drummer Torstein Lofthus. Suddenly, they were able to mine all of those past sounds for an album that could not sit still. In 57 minutes, they jerked from Naked City-speed eruptions to Ministry-sized beatings, from Meshuggah-bordering technicality to Melvins-dumb lumber. Hell, they ended with a King Crimson cover. If you didn’t come to expect surprises, you’d come to deal with whiplash, vertigo, or nausea soon enough.</p>
<p>But any record as adventurous and idea-saturated as <i>Blackjazz</i> creates a de facto albatross for the band that’s made it: Hit repeat, and you’ve made yourself obsolete. Push the hybridization to the limits again, and you run the risk of becoming merely tedious. (See Shining’s collaborators in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6873-enslaved/"" target=""_blank"">Enslaved</a> for a case in point.) So on <i>One One One</i>, their first studio LP since <i>Blackjazz</i>, Shining has smartly pulled back and inward, delivering nine incredibly understandable but willfully baroque modern rock singles in about 36 minutes. Rather than find several dozen new ways to surprise, Shining landed upon just one-- trim the excess, forego the over-involved lyrical complications, and make a rock’n’roll record. <i>One One One</i> likely won’t rearrange anyone’s imaginations regarding how much motion a band can fit into one album, but it does lift the veil of obtusity from Shining, a band that’s suddenly as good at songs as they have been at suites.</p>
<p><i>One One One</i> opens with a short squall of guitar noise and an immediate drum groove, funneling into a verse that runs with the same italicized spirit as most any rock number you’ll find along the FM dial. Roaring keyboards and chugging riffs swell beneath Munkeby’s hook, pushing the signal outward. It’s just one of several instantly memorable numbers here: “Walk Away” is little more than a series of refrains, with Munkeby repeating the title over a tech-metal riff by way of mere introduction. By the song’s end, Shining’s toggled between at least three passages that could count as hooks. With its throbbing electronics and calliope keyboard, the hilariously titled “My Dying Drive” crams <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"" target=""_blank"">Nine Inch Nails</a> and King Crimson into the same four-minute space; the result is a defiant pop-rock song about fucking with the man even at death, anchored by a refrain meant to be shouted out in some sweaty pit. That’s a consistent feeling throughout <i>One One One</i>: Shining no longer seems to be a post-everything oddity, making music best analyzed from some safe distance. They are making visceral, economical anthems, meant to be felt first and fussed over later.</p>
<p>To that last point, though, these songs do brim with the sort of compositional depth that’s now expected from Shining, even if they take a while to tease out. “The One Inside”, for instance, seems to get stuck on a drum roll at one point, creating a bed for Munkeby’s voice that feels both shifting and stable. Just beneath the thrust of the song, the bass steps on top of and away from the groove, while the guitars fan outward from the central riff, creating the illusion of feathered density. And then there’s the saxophone solo that fuels the sudden burst of black metal-- it’s Shining doing Shining, just in delightfully compact form. Speaking of saxophone, “How Your Story Ends” might be the first song to mix an unmitigated metalcore chorus with moments of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7759-motorhead/"" target=""_blank"">Motörhead</a> rumble and a horn solo that borrows liberally from the blues <i>and</i> Middle Eastern melodies. These complications make the song no less direct; they simply make it something you’ll want to listen to again and again.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/i-talked-to-the-shining-about-the-other-band-called-the-shining-and-the-movie-called-the-shining"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview with Noisey</a>, Munkey admitted that, for a decade, he was too busy with jazz and classical fare to pay much attention to heavy metal or industrial music. When he stumbled back into heavier sounds several years ago, Shining soon shifted toward its complicated machinations. “I started rediscovering metal,” he listened. “I listened to my old stuff, Death and Emperor, and then I started discovering newer stuff like Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails.” That sort of joyous newness defines both <i>Blackjazz </i>and <i>One One One</i>, creating the effect of a child high on sugar, racing around a room for an hour until collapsing. The shifting approaches of <i>Blackjazz</i> redirected some of that energy, while <i>One One One</i> focuses it directly into successive four-minute bursts. That’s exhausting <i>and</i> exhilarating, yes, but it’s also the symptom of a band that’s still fascinated by what they accomplish. That is, the surprises likely aren’t over.</p></div>"|18099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18099-shining-one-one-one/|7.5|Grayson Currin

""Italo survived electroclash,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10351-after-dark/"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> Marc Hogan; indie rock had too. Six years later, dance music has pervaded that genre to the point where discussing specific movements no longer feels relevant; it's just <i>there</i>, and <i>After Dark</i> had a part in that. Its status as a modern indie/dance classic makes it easy to forget to how thin and stitched-together it felt, how delicate its papier-mache disco. Putting aside the compilation's home-printed artwork and lack of jewel case, the album was rife with cover songs, demos, and remixes. Johnny Jewel's return last year with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"" target=""_blank"">Chromatics</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30141-symmetry/"" target=""_blank"">Symmetry</a> was notable for the music's quality but also for its scope: confirmation, finally, that the Italians Do It Better label had gas left in the tank.</p>
<p>There's always been a factory feel to Italians Do It Better, Jewel the enigmatic visionary farming his disco labor out to acolytes and hangers-on. The cast of characters assembled on <i>After Dark 2</i> supports this; primary vehicles Chromatics and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1728-glass-candy/"" target=""_blank"">Glass Candy</a> account for nearly half the tracks, but many contributions come from IDIB B-teamers recording their first music in years. If there's an exemplar of the odd IDIB universe, it's Mirage (officially the 24th artist to adopt that moniker according to <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Mirage+%2824%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Discogs</a>) who show up with only their third-ever track; the first two being available only on the original <i>After Dark</i>.</p>
<p>The assembly-line nature of Jewel's productions provides a counterpoint to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/"" target=""_blank""><i>Random Access Memories</i></a>, reminding us that while some strains of classic dance music were meticulous and expert, many were cheap and quick. Jewel's ability to pump out quality tracks with a host of collaborators connects him to the faceless electro/disco producers of the 1980s; presenting the tracks as glammy punk-noir fantasies contemporizes him. Jewel is an expert stylist, able to project fashionable cool without exclusivity or mightiness. Never more so than on <i>After Dark 2</i>; the songs here are big and warm, tighter, more muscular updates of the originals, and they make common sadness-- the search for love, forgiveness, intimacy-- feel heroic and communal.</p>
<p>The IDIB rhythms and affectations-- thrumming Italo disco, icy female coos-- are largely unchanged, but the analog boil beneath them is robust. This is important when working with vocalists whose charm lies largely in their steely contempt for excess. Having Glass Candy back in the fold is crucial. Singer Ida No's flat, artless vocals are a perfect foil for Jewel's metronomic synthesizers. She's also the most compelling songwriter: the resplendent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12336-glass-candy-warm-in-the-winter/"" target=""_blank"">""Warm in the Winter""</a> is the headliner, but ""The Possessed"" and ""Beautiful Object"" deliver pleasantly sighing choruses. Chromatics sound at home on the wistful ""Cherry"", and they parry their last album's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12663-kill-for-love/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> with the nervy ""Looking for Love"": ""I'm still/ Still looking/ Looking for love,"" killing for it having failed, apparently.</p>
<p>It's in this context that contributions from Farah-- severe and menacing-- and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27800-desire/"" target=""_blank"">Desire</a>-- easy and sweet-- can be lovely diversions, and that instrumentals from Mike Simonetti and Jewel (as Symmetry) can feel like luxe interludes. The vocoder funk of Mirage's ""Let's Kiss"" and Twisted Wire's husky piano house offer crucial variety. Lesser lights are afforded the opportunity to be lesser, in other words. They can thank the compilation's album-like feel: <i>After Dark 2</i> plays more like <i>Johnny Jewel &amp; Friends Present...</i> than a compendium of disparate acts. It updates the IDIB sound without losing its buzzy neon charm, which remains a hugely attractive mode.</p></div>"|18134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18134-after-dark-2/|8.3|Andrew Gaerig

It's the decade where he set up his presence, released his defining works, and then noisily tried to escape. That he spent the last dozen years of his career stumbling into the kind of modern rock/indie pop territory that didn't mesh well with his early aesthetic says something about how definitive (and potentially imprisoning) his fame-making sound was. Whether or not his genre-hopping would've worked out on its own terms-- and for the most part, it hasn't-- it'd have a hard time maintaining the moody, seductive yet stressed pull of his first few albums. But Tricky wasn't wrong to try shaking his trip-hop rep and attempt new things, he just sounded so adrift that it was hard to figure out where he'd find his way back to once he finally refocused. By the time he released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14677-mixed-race/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mixed Race</i></a> in 2010, it became clear that the best-case scenario where Tricky was concerned was to either wait for some new thing to finally click, or hope that he looks back just long enough to be reinvigorated by memories of where he started.</p>
<p><i>False Idols</i> tries to split the difference, and weirdly enough, it nearly succeeds. Calling it <i>Maxinquaye</i> for the middle-aged seems a bit too glib, but this album really does return to the ethereal, almost fragile intensity that marked his well-loved 1995 debut with the more solemn perspective of a grown man who's felt like he's lost his way. And for a while, everything seems right. The production's appropriately spare, moody, and elegant, streamlined and engineered to sound uniquely his while still throwing alternate jabs and nods to contemporary R&amp;B's underacknowledged debt to his sound. But it's still far from monochromatic; the subdued yet rich minimal house thump of “Bonnie &amp; Clyde” and the dirgy guitar squall of Antlers collaboration/cover/semi-rewrite “Parenthesis” are integrated variations on the stylistic theme, not whiplash detours. That sustained mood benefits greatly from his harmonizing and interjections with singer Francesca Belmonte, filling Martina Topley-Bird's role as the quietly assured yet emotionally driven foil to Tricky's clenched, whispery murmur, like two introverts trapped in close quarters. Going into a Tricky album hoping for that pull between beauty and tension is going to leave you at least somewhat happy with this record.­</p>
<p>But the catch-22 of “return to form” albums is that without the dregs that precede them, they need to stand up as something deeper, something without ghosts following it around. And even if <i>False Idols</i> is approaching a more coherent idea of what a Tricky album could sound like in 2013, a lot of the record comes off more like a tentative first step. There's no overthinking here, which is a relief after all the tryhard high-concept ideas-- poppy hip-house, French Touch knockoffs, leering cock-rock-- that didn't really take off on his last couple of records. But with that simplified approach comes simplified songs: Only the gel-submerged minimalist funk of “Tribal Drums” barely scrapes past the three-and-a-half-minute mark, and even the more immediately catchy tracks start to sound like sketches on further investigation. It's most evident in the songwriting: Opener “Somebody's Sins” is simply a cover of Patti Smith's opening verses to her cover of “Gloria”; “Nothing's Changed” features a generous interpolation of <i>Pre-Millennium Tension</i> highlight “Makes Me Wanna Die”, and too many songs lean on simplistic metaphors and imagery that merely hint at deeper things they leave frustratingly concealed: the vague romantic overtones of “Valentine”; disjointed debauchery on “Is That Your Life”, the evasive “Passion of the Christ”.</p>
<p>And yet in the end it does show promise: the songs aren't bad by any stretch, and when the first negative that comes to mind is that the ideas need to be fleshed out a bit, it's a long way from wishing they'd've been discarded in the first place. Even with 15 tracks all averaging around the three-minute mark, there's little time on <i>False Idols</i> devoted to offbeat goofs or weird failed experiments, just a handful of songs that bottom out at “not bad but a bit forgettable.” A front-to-back listen won't dredge up any obvious duds or collar-grabbing highlights, but it might get this album's focused vision planted a bit deeper in your head. Tricky might not have succeeded in bringing his old sound 100% back to life, but as an effort to hit the reset button and rediscover himself, this record's a better-than-expected surprise.</p></div>"|18064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18064-tricky-false-idols/|6.7|Nate Patrin

Before the pair adopted the nostalgic-by-design <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31080-classixx/"" target=""_blank"">Classixx</a> moniker, they cranked out a few electro-chintz remixes as Young Americans, an assumed allusion to the classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">David Bowie</a> LP of the same name.

The cover of Classixx's debut LP, <i>Hanging Gardens</i>, is a double-vision homage to the sleeve for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a>'s 1988 album <i>Optical Race</i>, while its title track pilfers the melody of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/"" target=""_blank"">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s glistening <i>Tango in the Night</i> cut ""Seven Wonders"".</p>
<p>Internet-age producers who frequently create with others' raw materials aren't necessarily guaranteed a similar level of success when left to create worthwhile music on their own-- take last year's debut album from mashup outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28625-the-hood-internet/"" target=""_blank"">the Hood Internet</a>, the astoundingly tepid <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17040-feat/"" target=""_blank"">FEAT</a>. </i>With <i>Hanging Gardens</i>, Blake and David soar above any low expectations; they've put together a cohesive, impossibly lush record that pays adequate lip service to a variety of pop sounds while loading the decks with glossy, head-cleaning dance. Classixx remixes frequently possess the slick expansiveness of disco, with a touch of nocturnal mood-shading to boot. By contrast, <i>Hanging Gardens</i> is bright, warm, and breezy, and as the summertime approaches, its release couldn't have come at a better time.</p>
<p>Classixx excel at creating a textured push-and-pull within the framework of their own productions, and <i>Hanging Gardens</i> provides several wordless moments to get lost in. Take the contemplative 4/4 of ""A Fax From the Beach"", which plays like a post-post-comedown sequel to Fred Falke's indelible, wistful 2008 single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QXDOMZgc_M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""808 PM at the Beach""</a>-- as well as a killer transition or two, like when the rollin'-and-scratchin' bump of ""Rhythm Santa Clara"" gently bleeds into the declarative synth stabs that open up ""Dominoes""' positive, propulsive Balearic structure. Album highlight ""Holding On"", meanwhile, elicits comparisons to <i>Discovery</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>, uncannily combining ""One More Time""'s repetitive pulse with the bright-eyed, bushy-tailed purity of ""Digital Love"".</p>
<p>Classixx are very good producers-- their sonic excursions are placid and stylistically considered, with plenty of surface beauty, if not a ton of depth-- but the biggest surprise of <i>Hanging Gardens</i> is that they're great songwriters, too. It's astonishing how many of the guest appearances simply <i>work</i>, and in such a satisfying way, too: Take the all-caps kiss-off anthem ""All You're Waiting For"", featuring a typically tart vocal from ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a> member and DFA fixture Nancy Whang, and Sarah Chernoff's dizzying ""A Stranger Love"", reminiscent of Saint Etienne's glassy-eyed club gestures.</p>
<p>Jesse Kivel of L.A. electro-pop duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28702-kisses/"" target=""_blank"">Kisses</a> does effective mush-mouthed romanticism all over the palm-muted synths of ""Borderline"", while chillwave castrato Pat Grossi (whose monastic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28560-active-child/"" target=""_blank"">Active Child</a> project has benefitted from Classixx's touch <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14640-when-your-love-is-safe-classixx-remix/"" target=""_blank"">before</a>) does his weightless choirboy thing over the airy bells of ""Long Lost"", an ethereal R&amp;B-leaning tune that's a silkier, less pathos-heavy version of what AC did on 2011's just-okay <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15745-you-are-all-i-see/"" target=""_blank""><i>You Are All I See</i></a>. The record's most potent punch, ironically, is more than three years old: ""I'll Get You"", which saw release as a single in 2009 on the waning tastemaker imprint Kitsuné, wields Jeppe's brash vocal beams as an effective weapon, as the former Junior Senior vocalist asks repeatedly and somewhat ridiculously, ""Do you like bass?"" It shouldn't work, but it does, and pretty well.</p>
<p>More than anything else, the pure pop cuts on <i>Hanging Gardens</i> leave the listener wanting more, which is exactly the record's paradoxical flaw: although it runs to nearly an hour long, a good deal of space is relegated to the more instrumental cuts, which aren't quite distinctive enough to push the five-and-six-minute mark as they frequently do. The less impressive material loses its effectiveness when isolated from the sequencing of the album, which flows impressively as a front-to-back listen. <i>Hanging Gardens</i> is a decadent trifle to lose yourself in, a deceptively simple record that has the potential for great longevity.</p></div>"|18004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18004-classixx-hanging-gardens/|7.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

Their sounds may be disparate, but they're united by their desire to tackle questions of identity from unique and exciting perspectives, which makes Arbutus' latest release (from one of its earliest signings) a strong fit. Edmonton transplant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31231-sean-nicholas-savage/"" target=""_blank"">Sean Nicholas Savage</a> put together three full-lengths in 2011, suffered through the end of a relationship, and decamped to Berlin, where he wrote and recorded <i>Other Life</i>, an album largely shaped by that romantic turmoil. The final product is an unvarnished, honest collection of avant-pop meditations on love and the individual.</p>
<p>The major musical antecedent hanging over <i>Other Life</i> is Dan Bejar's band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"" target=""_blank"">Destroyer</a>, a group that has spent several full-length albums embarking on sonic reclamation projects like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2293-your-blues/"" target=""_blank"">Your Blues</a> </i>(tiny MIDI symphonies) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kaputt</i></a> (chintzy, cheesy soft rock and jazz fusion). Savage deploys smooth, adult-contemporary instrumentation whose sound verges on tinny and toy-like, in a marriage of the principles guiding those two Destroyer records. It's not an innovative maneuver, but the juxtaposition of that sound with Savage's voice-- high, reedy; cracking and bending with emotion-- and the hefty lyrical content is jarring and effective.</p>
<p>Savage's own exploration of identity manifests in ideas of impersonation: ""These days I feel like I'm somebody else/ Who looks just like me/ But he's not me,"" he sings on opener ""She Looks Like You"", a relationship ballad that frames the way people change over time and slowly become unrecognizable to each other. The best songs on <i>Other Life</i> tuck similarly weighty concepts into romantic narratives, whether it's fantasizing about living another life to escape the mistakes made in this one (on the title track) or coping with a love that cripples as it endures (""More Than I Love Myself""). The icky come-ons and dismissals of ""Lonely Woman"" recall the way Arbutus alumnus Majical Cloudz delights in making his audience uncomfortable. It takes a good deal of bravery to write and record songs that are so naked and unflinching, and it pays off: Savage's courage and palpable investment in the material makes it easy to connect and empathize with his subject matter.</p>
<p>After trekking through dangerous, taxing emotional terrain for the great majority of its runtime, <i>Other Life</i> ends with the sweet, bubbling ""Chin Chin"", an ode to gentle kisses on the chin delivered in the morning light. These lovers aren't posturing, fantasizing, or racked with anxiety; they're happy, unadorned, revelling in each other's goofy love. And while Savage has cobbled together a very good, honest album from a dark place, placing ""Chin Chin"" at the record's close is a bright glimmer of hope for what could come next.</p></div>"|18153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18153-sean-nicholas-savage-other-life/|7.4|Jamieson Cox

Over a disquieting Möbius strip keyboard line, she performs a wordless fanfare, sing-chants the verses, and splits into a choir of singers on the vocal hook. “Hey, what do you hear?” she asks coyly. On the protracted bridge, her voice warps and mutates and turns the syllables into pure sounds. Hval goes deliberately flat, savoring the pulsating dissonance, until all that is left is a high, tensile note that wavers in either distress or desire. Rather than alienating, it’s actually inviting: a strange and powerful performance. <i>Innocence Is Kinky</i> thrives on such moments, when Hval’s primary instrument sounds like it’s disentangling itself from her body and swooping around the ether of the song.</p>
<p>First under the stage name Rockettothesky and later under her real name, Hval has been a mainstay in the Oslo scene for several years now, but little in her catalog-- which includes a handful of albums as well as two novels, several sound installations, and a master’s thesis on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"">Kate Bush</a>-- signaled the breakthrough she makes on <i>Innocence Is Kinky</i>. In the past her music has tended toward subdued art-pop, full of plaintive beats and hushed vocals; at her best such subtlety was commanding, even if it occasionally threatened to settle for decorous passivity. The new album, as that title suggests, is more direct, more brazen, more aggressive, more provocative, both conceptually and musically. Recording with producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3251-john-parish/"">John Parish</a>, Hval explores some enormous, unwieldy concepts that tend to pop up more often in textbooks than on turntables.</p>
<p>Opening with Hval watching internet porn and closing with her discovering a new way to inhabit her body, <i>Innocence Is Kinky </i>examines thorny issues of gender identity and commodified sexuality. She gives her songs titles like “Death of the Author” and “Amphibious, Androgynous”. Mythological figures wander in and out of these songs: Mephisto does his best Ophelia, Oedipus blindly wanders the streets of Oslo, and Pinnochio takes communion. By far the most significant figure among these songs is also the most human: Renée Falconetti, the silent-film star whose close-up in 1928’s <i>The Passion of Joan of Arc</i> is one of the most indelible images in the history of cinema. “The camera is a mirror, but mine, not yours,” Hval sings as an organ thrums in the background and a low bass note pulses on the downbeat.</p>
<p>She’s obviously having a blast throwing these figures and narratives against one another, and her irreverence suggests a playfulness that dispels any hint of pretension. Yet, she keeps the focus squarely on her commanding vocals, which means you don’t need to know Carl Theodor Dreyer from Laura Mulvey to appreciate this album. In fact, the most fascinating ideas on <i>Innocence Is Kinky</i> are the musical ones. While rooted in the same art-pop as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3161-yoko-ono/"">Yoko Ono</a>, and pre-“Sledgehammer” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"">Peter Gabriel</a>, Hval paints with a broad palette, not only deploying an array of sounds and styles but setting them against each other to create jarring juxtapositions. As “Mephisto in the Water” fades to its close, a few raw guitar chords introduce the stomping psych-pop of “I Called”. “Oslo Oedipus” opens with a Middle Eastern chorale, layered moans swaddled in reverb, before transitioning into a poetry recitation set to a clangorous beat. Based on a sound installation called <a href=""http://jennyhval.com/music/sound-installations/a-continuous-echo-of-splitting-hymens-2012"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“A Continuous Echo of Splitting Hymens”</a>, “Give Me That Sound” is composed of belches of frazzled distortion and bent vocals that make for an arresting interlude before Hval launches into “I Got No Strings”, the album’s truest rock song. The seams between the songs speak as loudly as the songs themselves, giving the album the shape of a journey. It’s less a critical essay than a picaresque: a woman leaving the dirty white glare of her computer and wandering around Oslo.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the album’s heady diversity originates in Hval’s malleable voice, which alters style, approach, timber, and tone from one measure to the next. One moment she addresses the listener in a slyly conspiratorial whisper, as if to draw you into her curious world. The next, she lets loose a full-throated wail that shakes that world apart. Not content to merely test the limitations of musical genre, of sound, of her own voice (and, by virtue, her body), Hval knowingly transgresses those limitations as she explores what’s just beyond her range. That bold tack gives <i>Innocence Is Kinky</i> its unique aesthetic, but it is also, oddly enough, what keeps the music so grounded in the physical and the human.  </p></div>"|18135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18135-jenny-heval-innocence-is-kinky/|7.8|Stephen M.

Since their inception, the Savannah, Ga., group has translated instability into energy, outlasting membership changes and tragedies to create strange and compelling stylistic welds. During the last decade, they’ve shouldered themselves nominally somewhere between sludge metal and psychedelic rock, but those terms are simply outsider touchstones for Kylesa’s brilliant internal turbidity. Indeed, their music is a mix of hardcore force and pop approachability, narcotic textures and double-drummer thunder. They are less defined by any one of those elements than the way they treat them as critical components within a grand crucible, parts meant to be steadily whisked into an alchemic whole. To wit, when <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2010/12/kylesas_phillip.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn Vegan asked frontman Phillip Cope</a> to list his favorite songs of the year in 2010, he named the usual suspects and stylistic peers (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"" target=""_blank"">Torche</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1943-high-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">High on Fire</a>) alongside dream-state indie rock (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a>), insurgent post-punk garage rock (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5789-abe-vigoda/"" target=""_blank"">Abe Vigoda</a>), and bands that, like Kylesa, still get dubbed metal because of heavy pedigrees and references (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5913-alcest/"" target=""_blank"">Alcest</a>). This variety has long served Kylesa well, too, pushing them toward wider acceptance even as they’ve redoubled their strange syntheses.</p>
<p>After a string of LPs that have consistently found Kylesa fortifying these wayward genre aggregations, <i>Ultraviolet</i>-- their sixth album and second for Season of Mist-- is an unexpected misstep. At first, <i>Ultraviolet</i> might feel passive or polite, as though Kylesa is the metal band auditioning for a roster spot on Sub Pop or Merge. There’s a slow-burning ballad, a straightforward charge or two, and at least one tune that stretches shoegaze reverie over quickly flickering riffs. It’s as if they’ve tempered their approach, eliminating the exciting outliers of their toolkit to arrive at a hard rock album that sounds standard enough to be safe. Past Kylesa albums have felt alternately like bulldozers and magnets; <i>Ultraviolet</i> often feels only like another middling record.</p>
<p>But the problem is that Kylesa have actually let their genre pillaging overtake their actual songcraft-- that is, in trying to give the psychedelic, shoegaze and jam band aspects of their sound more room within the spotlight, they’ve created a mess that sometimes seems rudderless. The first three tracks, for instance, feel like a non-navigable maze with no steady vectors or outlined intentions: Opener “Exhale” shortchanges a great hook from Laura Pleasants with verses that don’t support the same weight and an instrumental breakdown that simply stalls the song. “Unspoken” hides behind an unnecessary 80-second introduction and subsequently plunges into an unremarkable and overly long solo, with Cope dancing around the impressive groove as though he’s ashamed of its simplicity. And during “Grounded”, Cope drowns many of his own vocals in effects, hiding them behind the wallop like coded messages. Likewise, Pleasants harmonizes the chorus with herself, singing in a round that distracts from the song’s sizzling riff. Time and again, from start to finish, <i>Ultraviolet</i> pauses to concede to such extraneous effects and rockpiled elements, as if Kylesa have finally made the mistake of brandishing their eccentricity rather than simply thriving on it. <i>Ultraviolet</i> rarely feels singular or confident; it’s the sound of a band attempting to underline its claims to distinction.</p>
<p>But when Kylesa allows those extrinsic factors to emphasize their momentum rather than detract from it, they are unstoppable: “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15385-kylesa-were-taking-this/"" target=""_blank"">We’re Taking This</a>”, for instance, is a monstrous flogging, with guitars that twist like rusty corkscrews, drums that push ahead like a cavalcade, and a refrain that feels like a battle cry. Thing is, all of Kylesa’s itinerant weirdness is here, too-- guitars that suddenly warp out of time, drums that pull back enough to give the textures space, and backmasked harmonies that swirl around Cope’s lead like vapor trails. The same holds for the two-minute bruiser “What Does it Take”, which gallops from the gates and doesn’t pull up until the next song begins. But Kylesa shoehorns a kaleidoscopic guitar solo into the tune and saturate the space between the drums and the vocals with guitar effects, not a central riff. “Low Tide,” the album’s best surprise, is a drifting, magnetic ballad; overactive bass, distant harmonies, and streaks of soft guitar noise create an impressionistic web for its starry-eyed hook. In all three instances, Kylesa’s disparate strains work together to create the same inexorable sense of euphoria that unites most of the band’s influences, if no longer their entire catalog. Kylesa albums once seemed cut instantly from whole cloth. Despite its highs, <i>Ultraviolet</i> is a patchwork of arduousness, with some seams still showing.    </p></div>"|18057.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18057-kylesa-ultraviolet/|7.0|Grayson Currin

And it’s been that long since any form of denial played a role in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5558-rivers-cuomo/"" target=""_blank"">Rivers Cuomo</a>’s music. From “Pork and Beans” to “Can’t Stop Partying”; from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13656-raditude/"" target=""_blank""><i>Raditude </i></a>cover art to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14652-hurley/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hurley </i></a>cover art; from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49861-the-weezer-cruise-is-back/"" target=""_blank"">Weezer Cruise</a> to the <i>Pinkerton </i>reunion tour, Cuomo has pretty much done everything over the past 17 years except take “no” for an answer. So when you consider his longstanding predilection for Asian culture (to put it mildly), the only thing surprising about him making a Japanese-language album is that it took him until 2013 to do so. And yet, <i>Scott &amp; Rivers </i>is one of the few unequivocally good ideas he’s had in a very, very long time: name a 21st century Weezer album that wouldn’t be immediately improved if you didn’t understand English.</p>
<p>Cuomo linked up with a suitable travel buddy in Scott Murphy, frontman for Allister, a Drive Thru pop-punk band you might be familiar with if you keep tabs on the Warped Tour, but have likely only heard if you’ve <i>been </i>to the Warped Tour. They're very much “big in Japan.” So what can be expected of <i>Scott &amp; Rivers</i>? Are Murphy and Cuomo going to fully concede to the stylistic tenets of J-pop? Is it simply going to split the difference between <i>Girlfriends and Dead Ends </i>with lyrics like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okthJIVbi6g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“goddamn you half-Japanese girls”</a> sung in full Japanese? Is it going to appeal to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mxEoA3G9Wg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the 18-year old girl who lives in small city in Japan</a> or the 35-year-old she grew up to be since <i>Pinkerton</i>? Holy shit, there’s a song called “Butterfly” on here; is Rivers really <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxuipSmYoF8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>going there</i>?</a></p>
<p>Some of these questions are answered definitively, all are answered rather uninterestingly. No matter what language you speak or how familiar you are with either artist's work, there isn't much culture shock to be had listening to <i>Scott &amp; Rivers</i>. In short, it’s a hell of a lot like an off-brand recent Weezer album, in that the style isn’t guitar rock taking cues from factory pop, but factory pop interpreted through clinical guitars that sound like they’re sourced from test tubes rather than tube amps. It would sound overproduced for 1998 yet seems curiously rinky-dink compared to the current pop maximalism of any continent; <i>Scott &amp; Rivers </i>splits most of its time between ruthlessly utilitarian power pop and midtempo, jangly acoustic alt-rock that reimagines the break between <i>Pinkerton</i> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8611-weezer-green-album/"">Green Album</a> as one where Cuomo ditched Harvard for higher education in the form of Stroke 9 or Eve 6 CDs. Or, in the case of the pure synth-pop numbers and the cover of Kimura Kaela's ""Butterfly"" (sorry), those of Vitamin C or any other sub-Spice I can’t immediately recall.</p>
<p>This isn’t some Kickstarter lark-- it’s being released on Universal’s Japanese imprint. But the few hooks that are sung in English make it abundantly clear that neither Cuomo nor Murphy's songwriting has been altered in the slightest: “I love, love, love my homely girl!/ She just knocks me to the ground!” “I freakin’ love my life!/ It’s turning out just right!/ It’s a party every night!” Those two songs are “Homely Girl” and “Freakin’ Love My Life”, naturally. Otherwise, the frictionless production and rounded, vowel-heavy Japanese phonetics gives <i>Scott &amp; Rivers </i>a sonic viscosity where consuming one song or all 12 feels roughly equal. It sticks with you, but the sweetness has a sickly chemical feel.<i></i></p>
<p>Cuomo told us from the beginning that his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTlK3UVkK8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">favorite rock group was Kiss</a>, so we shouldn’t be surprised about him using his artistic goodwill as quarters in a perpetual game of whack-a-mole, going after whatever monetization opportunity presents itself. In some ways, it’s weirdly admirable. <i>Scott &amp; Rivers</i> just seems more savvy than anything-- you sense that he and Murphy know something us Yankees don’t, or maybe <i>Scott &amp; Rivers</i> is just prelude to Weezer’s inevitable <i>Live at Budokan</i>. There’s a heartening belief in how Cuomo still sticks to writing the kind of songs that need mass exposure for them to mean anything to anybody, and assumes rock radio still has the juice to provide it. There’s no doubt <i>he </i>believes it, so there’s no way a song called “Freakin’ Love My Life” could be ironic; Cuomo’s fantasy world is the realest thing he knows.</p></div>"|18138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18138-scott-rivers-scott-rivers/|4.9|Ian Cohen

There are so many people working in subtly different but broadly similar styles, and so much of their music is less keen to develop the individual persona than to dissolve it in a universalist hum. One exception is Matthew Cooper, who has spent the past decade becoming a touchstone for contemporary indie ambient music. As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1334-eluvium/"">Eluvium</a>, Cooper has staked out an ambient brand that blends piano-playing in the styles of classical minimalism and French Impressionism with dreamy electronics and guitar drones derived from IDM and shoegaze. It should not diminish his talent as an arranger to hazard that his centralizing influence probably rests on his impulse for accessibility above intricacy. Cooper's music can be light or dark, vehement or mild, romantic or hopeless, but it is always shaped into emotionally lucid, easily habitable spaces.</p>
<p>Still, Cooper's stature is surprising when you consider that he hasn't released a great record since 2007. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9926-copia/"">Copia</a> </i>was the highlight because it combined modes that were isolated on his prior releases-- from the Satie-like piano jingles of <i>An Accidental Memory in the Case of Death</i> to the grainy, radiant drones of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2765-talk-amongst-the-trees/""><i>Talk Amongst the Trees</i></a>-- with expanded acoustic instrumentation, resulting in a majestic statement that sounded like the work of an artistic thinker rather than a fine technician of incidental sound. <i>Copia </i>at last meets its match in <i>Nightmare Ending</i>, Eluvium’s commanding new double LP. That it was supposed to be <i>Copia</i>'s immediate successor might make you slap your forehead over Cooper's five years of mixed successes: the low-impact ambient techno of his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30646-martin-eden/"" target=""_blank"">Martin Eden</a> alias, the tepid vocal-centric pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13927-similes/""><i>Similes</i></a>, and the dark, noisy <i>Static Nocturne</i> (the best of the bunch). But perhaps Cooper couldn't finish <i>Nightmare Ending</i> until he repeated the process that produced <i>Copia</i>, gathering new fuel for this bonfire of an album. The bided time pays off in what feels like a career-spanning best-of that happens to contain all new music.       </p>
<p>Alternately delicate and deluging, the 80-plus minutes of music that compose <i>Nightmare Ending</i> are wrought together with a heft and thrust that banish the aftertaste of Cooper's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15158-leaves-eclipse-the-light-the-motion-makes-me-last/"">most recent EPs</a>, which collected leftover dregs from <i>Similes</i>. This tremendous collection holds electronics-encased piano themes (e.g. the breathtaking dawn of ""Don’t Get Any Closer"" and the Harold Budd-like ""Covered in Writing""), rich orchestral fogs that recall <i>Copia</i> (""Warm""and ""Unknown Variation""), and rhythmically roiling dark clouds resembling <i>Static Nocturne</i> (""By the Rails"", ""Envenom Mettle""). Elegant little solo piano compositions, insistent with nostalgic repetitions, periodically surface through the heavy drapings of texture and harmony, proving refreshing for it. Cooper even redeems the ambient pop that derailed him on <i>Similes</i> by roping in a ringer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>'s Ira Kaplan, to sing on the tender closer ""Happiness"".</p>
<p>Cooper <a href=""http://bighassle.com/publicity/eluvium"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reportedly</a> first conceived of <i>Nightmare Ending</i> as ""a way of helping loosen his self-imposed ideals of perfection,"" which provides a clue as to why the record makes such an impact. Cooper has never made anything terrible, but the greatest danger to which his music succumbs is to be too perfect, too placid and undisturbed, too perfunctorily lovely and sad. <i>Nightmare Ending</i>, on the other hand, is always bursting out through its own imperfections and impulsive gestures, with a wide emotional spectrum pumped full of fresh life from when Cooper returned to finish it years later. It's a long glorious exhalation of energies not actually dissipated, as it seemed for a while, but only multiplying in force under suppression.</p></div>"|18000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18000-eluvium-nightmare-ending/|7.8|Brian Howe

In certain circles, Agrimonia’s resume is positively star-studded, boasting members of Skitsystem, Martyrdöd, Miasmal, and At the Gates (which may explain the profound melodic death metal influence that creeps in), but they’ve never received as much attention as one would expect. Luckily, the winds have changed, and this eight-year-old project is getting its due. </p>
<p><i>Rites of Separation</i> is the band’s first LP since 2010’s <i>Host of the Winged</i> and third overall release. As good as its predecessors were, this latest album (and their debut for Southern Lord) shows a marked improvement and more evolved songwriting techniques. They’ve learned how to play to their strengths and trim some fat, which is crucial when you ping-pong between as many genres and styles as they’re wont to do. Agrimonia come from a punk and hardcore background, but are perfectly comfortable shaking off the crust and incorporating metallic influences. The thick, groovy Carcass riff buried halfway through “Hunted” is proof enough of their healthy appreciation for the left-hand path, and that’s just the second track. <i></i></p>
<p><i>Rites of Separation</i> opens with a clarion call that heralds the entrance of a crunchy main riff, tugged down into a descending melody and punctuated by vocalist Christina’s rabid growls. By crafting the song in a way that spans almost 11 minutes and features several distinct movements, Agrimonia know they’ve got time to let intensity ebb and flow, and stuff in a few solos for good measure. The prodigious length of the album’s five tracks is no accident. There’s an obvious post-rock/post-metal reference to be made, as these Swedes have certainly learned a thing of two about atmosphere and carefully weighted dynamics from Neurosis and their ilk, but ultimately, there’s more of an epic, dark crust hardcore vibe. Think Morne, Fall of Efrafa, Downfall of Gaia, or even Tragedy, who all embrace the same original crust punk foundations, but have been willing to branch out in search of more.</p>
<p>Agrimonia do this so well, it’s almost unfair. “While Life Lies” is a muted, somber affair, starting slow and quiet before picking up the pace from a shuddering sludgy crawl into a spate of sharply melodic death metal and bleak hardcore. Once more, Christina’s forceful, throat-scraping growls and admonitions are a massive help, used sparsely but wisely. Her approach is fairly one-dimensional, but allows her to fade comfortably into the shadows to function as an instrument rather than a focal point. Music like this needs space, and time, and Agrimonia know how to use both. “The Battle Fought” rushes out of the gate with a driving beat and a flurry of distorted riffs and doesn’t let up for a moment; even the peppy rock’n’roll part swinging on the tail end keeps its grip tight. Its smart, midtempo pace is typical of the songs on this album, but feels like a gallop compared to the more staid instrumental and atmospheric passages. There is an emotional element to the songs, of course, but the primary focus is on the music itself; indecipherable lyrics and cryptic song titles take a back seat to the wondrous scope of sonic expression that’s happening around them. Show, don’t tell.</p>
<p>Agrimonia take the “epic” tag seriously, it seems; this is one hell of a long album, especially for a punk/hardcore band, but each note and chord feels absolutely necessary. The final and most ambitious track, “Awaiting”, starts off with a woozy, industrialized drone (courtesy of Miasmal/Martyrdöd guitarist Pontus’ ominous keyboard work) and dares the listener to navigate its treacherous terrain, wandering through fiery hardcore and icy black metal while accompanied by heavy nods towards pure metallic crust and circling a gloomy, doomy central passage. The song fades out on another strong, complex melody and ends with a few airy moments of piano and acoustic guitar. It’s a lot to take in, but well worth the effort. <i>Rites of Separation</i> is a truly marvelous work of art, and will hopefully receive the recognition it deserves as one of 2013’s great triumphs.</p></div>"|17927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17927-agrimonia-rites-of-separation/|8.0|Kim Kelly

Last year, he put out the Timmy's Organism album <i>Raw Sewage Roq--</i> a solid collection of songs with scumbag lyrics slurred over blown-out hard rock guitars. But while the most recent Timmy's album is marked by its devotion to Johnny Thunders and the Freeze, his other band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29852-human-eye/"">Human Eye</a> is more defined by their sci-fi psychedelia. Their stage show usually involves Timmy throwing on a big monster mask, and their thematic territory tends to sound like something from the yellowed pages of a sci-fi paperback. Their 2011 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15705-they-came-from-the-sky/"">They Came From the Sky </a></i>paired punk rock muscle with buzzing sci-fi sonics. <i>Into Unknown</i>, the band's fourth studio album, takes a risk of sorts by backing away from the ""muscle"" part of the equation.</p>
<p>Instead, Timmy and the gang aim for a sound that's more paced than raucous. The percussion of ""Immortal Soldier"" moves quickly, but it simmers beneath the surface. Timmy is yowling, but the vocals are muffled. The guitar solo sounds smothered. With a slightly different arrangement and slightly faster tempos, it could be a soaring rock'n'roll anthem. Instead, the more muted tone folds into the album's loose narrative. And sometimes, the quieter elements are used to complement Timmy's noisier inclinations. ""Surface of Pluto"" starts out spare-- a quiet piano and acoustic guitar, some desolate <i>2001: A Space Odyssey </i>synths. Then, right as things get a bit sleepy, boom: big screeching guitar solo. At the end of the LP sits the title track: a six-minute, all-instrumental odyssey. There's a krautrock bassline, a simple melody being plunked out on a xylophone, and a warm guitar solo that switches from a warm Eastern tone to a scuzzy Detroit attack. With an occasional tinge of UFO feedback, it evokes exactly what it's meant to: a journey into the unknown. </p>
<p>Human Eye go in for more straightforward rock'n'roll, too, but aside from the barking track ""Juicy Jaw"", those are some of the album's weakest moments. ""Alligator Dance"" has the barroom piano, guitar sound, and howling vocals that sounded so great on <i>Raw Sewage Roq.</i> Here, however, they're implemented on a song with worse lyrics, an unnecessarily lethargic tempo, and a completely lazy guitar solo. ""Buzzin' Flies"" somehow feels too repetitive after just two-and-a-half minutes. Then there are the other questionable sonic decisions; throughout the record, there's a keyboard sound that's most easily described as ""circus organ."" Maybe that's what they're going for-- Timmy's stage presence and deranged howls, after all, aren't too dissimilar from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3ZbnfXEuyc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tim Curry in <i>It</i></a>.</p>
<p>The easy highlight is ""Outlaw Lone Wolf"", a story with the basic revenge-fueled beats of a Tarantino movie. It's the kind of song that provides every single piece of context in the most transparently stated lyrics possible, like Lefty Frizzell's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI_xCH6wkO8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Saginaw, Michigan""</a> or Tim Heidecker's <a href=""http://vimeo.com/46246490"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Titanic""</a>. With some acid rock guitars, Timmy embarks on the tale of the son of a blacksmith, who was abandoned as an orphan, rescued by Apaches, and became a great warrior. One day, while he was out hunting, somebody burned the entire village. As the warrior's charred wife dies in his arms, she manages these last words: ""It was the blacksmith/ Avenge our deaths."" (Again, nothing vague about this story <i>at all</i>.) And then there's an instrumental breakdown that sounds like Human Eye doing Ennio Morricone. It's a ridiculous, campy, awesome six minutes.</p>
<p>The pacing and sequencing of <i>Into Unknown</i> is stellar, but it's hard to get an accurate read of the album's overall feel. While the title track sounds contemplative, ""Alligator Dance"" is anything but. It's an album that seems to have a sense of humor, but aside from ""Outlaw Lone Wolf"", it's never quite <i>funny</i>. <i>Raw Sewage Roq</i> and <i>They Came From the Sky</i> each had a clear-cut aesthetic, and this album heads in too many directions to have one decisive focus. But hey, it's called <i>Into Unknown--</i> an appropriate title for an album that has songs about both Pluto and patricide.</p></div>"|18145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18145-human-eye-4-into-unknown/|6.7|Evan Minsker

An indignant backlash against the wave of EDM-R&amp;B that’s been sweeping the airwaves of the past few years, it’s a ballsy, against-the-grain move that highlights the identity crisis that Terius Nash seems to be undergoing. But in truth, the song's dilemma applies to his entire career. While <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">The-Dream</a> has written some of the biggest hits of the past decade-- ”Umbrella,” “Single Ladies”, lots more-- his solo work has failed to take off. Instead, he's developed a cult and has become a fixation of R&amp;B nerds everywhere. Packed with guest stars, <i>IV Play</i> feels like it’s finally vying for that elusive spotlight. And, while he’s still not making those “motherfucking dance songs,” for the first time it feels like he’s trying to keep up with everyone else.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>IV Play </i>starts off shaky with “High Art”, an awkward attempt at a club anthem. Nash has never done this sort of machismo well; his charm lies in his ability to string sweetly sung hooks together, but he forgoes his established style repeatedly in <i>IV Play’s </i>first half. Always a fan of references, he takes a thesaurus to Ginuwine’s “Pony” for the bizarre and plodding “Equestrian”, while the less said about the tepid mess of “Turnt” (with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"" target=""_blank"">2 Chainz</a>, no less) the better. The only decent guest appearance is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"" target=""_blank"">Pusha T</a>'s on ""Pussy"", which is ruined by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"" target=""_blank"">Big Sean</a>'s embarrassing appearance two minutes later. It’s the first time Nash has disappointed like this; he’s had a bum track or two, sure, but the early string of clunkers is discouraging.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Not that there aren’t gleams of brilliance. The title track is intriguingly out of character-- “I could give a fuck about the foreplay/ I’m talking straight sex,” this coming from the man who once described messing up his girl's hair like it was an elaborate courting ritual. But it falls into a despondent outro that edges on self-doubt. There’s been a string of self-loathing running through Nash’s music since his very public divorce (immortalized on 2011’s self-released <i>1977</i>), which he can’t quite seem to shake. It’s there in the defensive “Slow It Down”, it’s there in the outro to “IV Play” (“I don’t deserve you”), and it’s there in another one of the LP’s most plaintive tracks, “New Orleans”. Like an outtake from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15792-1977/"" target=""_blank""><i>1977</i></a>, the song’s subject (“this bitch”) is repeated at the end of every line, and while it’s undeniably affecting, the misogyny becomes grating.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Thankfully there’s at least one classic The-Dream track on <i>IV Play-- </i>the effortlessly airy “Michael”. And, though more questionable lyrics abound (“He say he love you/ I just wanna fuck you/ Over the weekend”), it has all the lilt and masterful vocalisms of his best work. But this song is an exception. For an artist that’s modeled himself so closely after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a>, it’s striking how <i>IV Play</i> resembles the Purple One’s late 80s transition phase when the Minneapolis artist tried to re-engage his black fans by self-consciously urbanizing his music (see <i>The Black Album</i>). <i>IV Play</i> has many of the same restless impulses, from the surprisingly excellent blues slow-burner “Too Early” to the two-songs-stuck-together shambles of “Loving You/ Crazy.” The brilliant auteur we fell in love with is still in here somewhere. He’s just buried under layers of pretense.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>IV Play</i> winds down with the epic “Holy Love,” which references his “Umbrella” height of 2007 and hints at emptiness in the wake of success. Where exactly his ire is directed is unclear, but it makes explicit a frustration obvious to anyone who’s been watching his solo career since it started, through record label ordeals, delayed release dates and scrapped albums. “Always with you baby/I’ll never sell out,” he sings in a verse to “Slow It Down,” which begins to feel like a coded message to his longtime fans. Sticking with him through the machinations of the music industry has never been more difficult than it is now, but <i>IV Play</i> still has its rewards. When the world finally heeds the plea of “Slow It Down”, he might achieve immortality all over again. For now, though, he’s merely human.</span></p></div>"|18053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18053-the-dream-fourplay/|6.9|Andrew Ryce

On 2004 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1756-la-maison-de-mon-reve/""><i>La maison de mon rêve</i></a>, sisters Bianca and Sierra Casady meowed warped endearments over freak folk guitars and hip-hop beats. It's their sparest and loveliest album, but it still raised eyebrows with ""Jesus Loves Me"", a seemingly heartfelt but inescapably patronizing burlesque of <a href=""http://www.negrospirituals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">negro spirituals</a> that repeatedly used an even more taboo word than ""negro."" How were we to take this coming from two white women, wedged in amid all those demented operatic stylings and feline French chansons? Were they sincerely culturally tone-deaf or were we being provoked, and if so, to feel what precisely? ""I <i>like</i> CocoRosie…"" you might say, on a pre-emptive defensive.</p>
<p>Things only got murkier over three more albums, as the Casadys expanded their junk drawer of guitar, piano, harp, toys, and percussion with electronics, bass, keyboards, and beatboxing. They had a phase of styling their faces like Guy Fawkes masks; a phase of wearing Sean John velour and cornrows. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1757-noahs-ark/""><i>Noah's Ark</i></a> featured unicorn sodomy on its cover, lyrics about <a href=""http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858556919/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">turning aborted babies into Bambies</a>, and criticism inoculations via <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/"">Antony Hegarty</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Devendra Banhart</a> features. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10122-the-adventures-of-ghosthorse-and-stillborn/""><i>The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn</i></a>, nursery rhymes crept toward raps, and CocoRosie's scab-picking at African-American otherness started to feel more like a particular fixation than just exotica among exotica. The record included some of the band's most flagrantly off-putting music (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXY7gtkhpP0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Japan""</a>, incompatible with any conceivable taste) and some of its most deceptively ingratiating. <a href=""http://vimeo.com/990601"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rainbowarriors""</a> was an electro-pop earworm where preposterously vapid lyrics masked a subtler angle on CocoRosie's more obvious race-baiting: They were based on Longfellow's Native American fantasia <a href=""http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/LonHiaw.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Song of Hiawatha""</a>, a sacred text of fraught cross-cultural appropriation.</p>
<p>Following <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14217-grey-oceans/"" target=""_blank""><i>Grey Oceans</i></a>, their meekest and least memorable album (except for its impressively unappealing cover), CocoRosie wipe the slate clean on <i>Tales of a Grass Widow</i>. With two Antony spots and sleek <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8718-valgeir-sigursson/"">Valgeir Sigurðsson</a> production, it returns to the more extroverted styles of <i>Noah's Ark</i> and <i>Ghosthorse</i>. But while those albums were full of tangents, <i>Grass Widow</i> highlights CocoRosie's most practical songwriting, with vocals that are often refreshingly natural and fluent. First single ""Gravediggress"", while thin for its length, gives an accurate impression of the rest of the record: The juiced-up piano and synth bounce of ""After the Afterlife"" leads without a hitch into ""Tears for Animals"", a sweeping duet with Antony, who sings sweetly about love for humankind. Beyond electronic pop, there are restorations of CocoRosie's folksy side; the cracked brightness of ""Roots of My Hair"" recalls faded Joanna Newsom comparisons. The cobwebs that overgrew <i>Grey Oceans</i> are swept back to corners such as ""Broken Chariot"", a quite reasonable four minutes of velvety Mesoamerican flutes.     </p>
<p>It's all remarkably pleasant for a CocoRosie album-- you leave it not with the feeling of having weathered an intriguing, baffling ordeal, but of having listened to something recognizable as an album. There are half-hearted jabs at provocation, with perspectives of endangered children linking songs such as ""Child Bride"" (""Whose little girl am I? / The man with the black hat will take me home tonight"") and ""Harmless Monster"", but it's all more soapy and sentimental than disturbing. Nor is there anything very loaded now about the generically misanthropic singsong raps over the lush whistles and tuned percussion of ""End of Time"". It feels like a long-held transgressive impulse spending its last momentum, beneficially redirecting energy into more direct emotional appeals.</p>
<p>It's hard to fathom that <i>Grass Widow</i> is the work of a band that has inspired so many <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2007/05/cocorosie_vs_pi.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sour fights</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/why-we-fight/7824-why-we-fight-5/"">think-pieces</a>, and <a href=""http://stereogum.com/414512/op-ed-an-artists-dialogue-on-cocorosies-grey-oceans/franchises/op-ed/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">passionate apologias</a> from prominent musicians. The question of whether CocoRosie were cynical shock-jocks or fearless artists proved permanently unanswerable to everyone, probably including the Casadys themselves. It was always too simple to say they were just charlatans, but it was also too simple to protest they were not. The point was that your position said something about who you were and what you believed in. But it's mooted on this open-hearted, revitalizing album, the boldest gesture left to a band that had been so determined to repulse. <i>Grass Widow</i> makes it easier to say, ""I like CocoRosie,"" period.</p></div>"|18063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18063-cocorosie-tales-of-a-grasswidow/|6.7|Brian Howe

He's been using that name on-and-off for a long time, but pre-2007, he was Kyle, one-eighth of the freak folk band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1662-feathers/"">Feathers</a>, who made gentle, Eastern-tinged acoustic tracks. With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"" target=""_blank"">J Mascis</a>, he was in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4671-witch/"">Witch</a>, which had jammier, stoner rock leanings. But Thomas needed another outlet, one that was truer to his own rock'n'roll tastes: He had been writing songs since he was about 10, obsessing over guitar heroes and bands like Green Day. So he revived King Tuff, having released a few CD-R albums in the early 2000s, and turned a batch of songs written between 2003 and 2006 into the project's proper debut album, 2008's <i>Was Dead</i>.</p>
<p>It's a tight, consistent, and unbelievably catchy rock album that quickly and effectively defined who and what ""King Tuff"" was, stuffed with killer guitar solos, infectiously sunny hooks, and lyrics that come off like personality-defining mantras. If you were at all familiar with Thomas' other work, the immediacy of <i>Was Dead</i> probably came as a surprise. But this was the album he'd been hoping to make <a href=""http://themusic.com.au/interviews/all/king-tuff-kyle-thomas/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">all along</a>: ""There’s been a few diversions into other types of music, but I’ve pretty much always had a rock'n'roll heart.""</p>
<p>The LP certainly made the rounds with garage heads, and eventually grabbed the attention of the Sub Pop offices. But by the time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16667-king-tuff/""><i>King Tuff</i></a> was released last year, <i>Was Dead </i>was already out-of-print and had become a collector's item. After an initial run of CD-Rs in 2007, it came out on <a href=""http://colonelrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Colonel Records</a> in 2008, was pressed four times, and eventually showed up on eBay for exorbitant costs. Even if it was just a couple of years old, owning a copy of <i>Was Dead</i> became something tangibly special. It initiated you into a club with a bunch of other weirdos, and the one thing you all had in common was one weird, great power pop album.</p>
<p>Its greatness definitely felt like a secret. While the garage focus at the time was on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5335-king-khan/"" target=""_blank"">King Khan</a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/"" target=""_blank"">Black Lips</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7921-jay-reatard/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Reatard</a>, <i>Was Dead</i> didn't exactly make a splash in the larger critical conversation. Thomas, of course, doesn't care about maintaining any sort of cult status he might have accidentally developed; he just wants people to hear it: ""It’s really flattering to be thought of as so ‘collectible,’ but you’d much rather that just everyone could have it.”</p>
<p>A new reissue on <a href=""http://www.burgerrecords.org/apps/webstore/products/show/3716254%20reissue"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Burger Records</a> proves that, as power pop-leaning rock'n'roll albums go, <i>Was Dead</i> is a front-to-back masterwork. While a lot of these kinds of records work under the ""peaks and valleys"" principle (because even the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"" target=""_blank"">Ramones</a> had songs like ""Here Today Gone Tomorrow"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend""), this thing is almost all peaks, one exhilarating hook after another, making for an album that begs to be blasted in a four-door with the sun shining and the windows down. It's got the hit-after-hit sequencing of <i>Boston </i>minus the proggy extravagance. It's legitimately tough to peg ""best songs"" on this album: ""A Pretty Dress"" and ""Just Strut"" are easy contenders with their saccharine melodies and fiery electric guitars, but about half a dozen others could easily be tapped as favorites.</p>
<p>The album's pace slows down exactly once during ""Stone Fox"", but even that track is fueled by a steady electric guitar churn, and ultimately, it's a much-needed cool-down to springboard into the choogle of killer closer ""So Desperate"". The album's final stretch offers some of its best moments. Thomas delivers a simple, triumphant melody, which seems to trigger an instant dopamine release. He caps the song's chorus with a set of ""woooooooooo WOO WOO!"" vocals and rounds the track out with a brief but point-perfect guitar solo. It's a very satisfying cap to an impressive album.</p>
<p>As a whole, <i>Was Dead</i> paints a portrait of the man behind King Tuff. ""Freak When I'm Dead"" is all about wanting to be buried in all his rings and favorite clothes. (""Everything with patches and everything with holes."") ""Sun Medallion"" paints a portrait of a man who drinks black coffee, drives a standard transmission green Chevrolet, smokes pot, and won't go <i>anywhere</i> without his sun medallion. There are songs about love (""Connection"") and lust (""Animal""). The world of <i>Was Dead</i> is attainable, warm, familiar, fun, and catchy as hell-- ""Alone and Stoned"" from <i>King Tuff</i> is a worthy successor. These are the songs that people scream back at him, word-for-word, in concert while he shreds, wearing all his rings and his sun medallion. Without the adornments, the guitar solos, and these songs, he's Kyle. This is the album that made him King.</p></div>"|17949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17949-king-tuff-was-dead/|8.4|Evan Minsker

But it almost always describes records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29054-still-corners/"" target=""_blank"">Still Corners</a>’ second album <i>Strange Pleasures</i>-- records filled with swooning harmonies, lush reverb, and vaporous melodies that are fleeting if you don’t make a concerted effort to hold onto them.</p>
<p>If not terribly distinctive, <i>Strange Pleasures</i> nonetheless represents progress for Still Corners. Their 2011 Sub Pop debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15894-still-corners-creatures-of-an-hour/"" target=""_blank""><i>Creatures of an</i> <i>Hour </i></a>was rightfully likened to a post-chillwave <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Broadcast</a>, who themselves drew heavily from the psychedelia of previous decades. Two years later, the London duo are more of a modernist kind of nostalgia act, taking the night drive alongside contemporary breakthroughs such as <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/"" target=""_blank"">Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13872-teen-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Teen Dream </a></i>and especially <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16452-kill-for-love/"" target=""_blank"">Kill for Love</a></i>-- records with self-explanatory titles that infused dream-pop with either an overwhelming sense of the moment, sex appeal, or danger. It’s a welcome shift, though Still Corners are establishing a presence more than a personality. Including a song called “I Can’t Sleep” amidst all this downy pillow talk is sort of asking for it, yet the duo do about enough to evoke what might be keeping them up: neon city lights, cars roaring in the distance, their own desire for escape.</p>
<p>Still Corners present <i>Strange Pleasures </i>as something of a driving record, though the implication throughout is that it’s better if someone else is at the wheel. Opener “The Trip” is a six-minute pacesetter that savors the transit more than whatever impending arrival awaits, as its steady acoustic strums and cruise-controlled rhythm progress at a safe speed. Meanwhile, the miniature motoriks of “Beatcity” and “Berlin Lovers” obsess over German synth engineering, and “Midnight Drive” is even less covert about its influences, a four-minute audition for <i>After Dark 3 </i>that’s still a little too on-the-nose.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the rest of <i>Strange Pleasures </i>approaches the edge of palpable sadness rather than wallowing in its depths, demonstrating how “Beginning to Blue” makes a color into a verb: the near-constant harmonies are guided by an instinct for high thread-count layering rather than harmonic composition, and every synth line sounds like a pricier version of the “quasar” or “space” preset on toy Casios. It’s often quite pretty, but there’s still something of a void within this nebular atmosphere.</p>
<p>The two predominant textures of <i>Strange Pleasures</i>-- ethereal gauze and smooth alabaster-- don’t make much of an impression, nor offer much to grip onto. While Tessa Murray’s vocals remain breathy and mysterious throughout, that doesn’t mean they draw you in. The closer you get, the more you realize how beholden she is to stock images of oceans, doves, and deep breaths. And yet, ""Fireflies"" becomes the true standout of <i>Strange Pleasures </i>by unapologetically embracing these tropes rather than cloaking them. At the center of such an image-conscious LP, it’s a surprising indulgence, its romantic ideals unabashedly gooey and awestruck. It doesn’t just share a title with the Owl City song; try to guess which lyric belongs to which band: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psuRGfAaju4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Awake when I’m asleep/ Because my dreams are bursting at the seams;”</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CeJieZWFBM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The night is long as we like/ All the innocents of youth and the fire light.”</a></p>
<p>Listening to <i>Strange Pleasures</i>, you’re reminded of why we invest so heavily in dreams to begin with: we want these passing fancies to have meaning, to be symbolic, to tell us something about ourselves. M83 or Beach House are able to create musical frameworks <i>bigger </i>than our own minds, something you can lose yourself in, to inspire waking dreams. <i>Strange Pleasures</i> works on a much more modest scale,<i> </i>content to subliminally scoot its way in, to serve as connective tissue between the Cocteau Twins and Chromatics on a mixtape, but not as the main attraction. It's a pleasant listen of selfless, opaque indie-pop that still feels indulgent, proof that captivating made-up dreams are the work of compelling dreamers, or have some basis in reality. After all, no one wants to hear what you dreamt about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymf67ilj1rA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unless you dreamt about them.</a></p></div>"|17965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17965-still-corners-strange-pleasures/|6.6|Ian Cohen

They're playing Kimbie's breakthrough ""Maybes"" (which later received an epochal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11872-maybes-james-blake-remix/"" target=""_blank"">Blake remix</a>), and near the end of the song, the three of them-- Blake and Kimbie principales Dominic Maker and Kai Campos-- take on the song's prying, percussive vocal riff. Maybe it's the setting, but the moment feels big. Friends singing with friends, tripping into pop music, figuring it out on the fly. Blake would develop those instincts, finding plenty of acclaim as a singer songwriter. Kimbie spent the ensuing years folding in on themselves, making pretty electro-acoustic vignettes. They released a couple of EPs and, eventually, a debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14412-crooks-lovers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Crooks &amp; Lovers</i></a>, that treated the U.K. electronic scene like a bonsai tree, pruning the unruly until something manicured and personal remained.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <i>Cold Spring Fault Less Youth</i>, their second album and first for Warp, they alter course. They take more risks, particularly with voices: their own, often, and with unexpected collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29959-king-krule/"" target=""_blank"">King Krule</a>. The duo, which has valued coherency and neatness, move towards live instrumentation, peppering their fizzy electronics with thumbed bass lines and crumpling drums. The music that results remains small and detailed, but also allows the humid outside air to contaminate it. If <i>Cold Spring</i> is not an unbridled reach for a brass ring, it's at least an acknowledgment that such a ring exists.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Don't let those instruments-- including the bossy brass sounds that open the album-- throw you, though. <i>Cold Spring</i> is a distinctly electronic album, and a modern one as well. Dolorous electric pianos and stuttering electronics constantly bother the rhythm section. And while <i>Cold Spring</i> owes debts-- to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1563-fridge/"" target=""_blank"">Fridge</a>, to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3187-oval/"" target=""_blank"">Oval</a>, to wonky stylists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2123-isotope-217/"" target=""_blank"">Isotope 217</a>-- its collection of tones, syncopation, and lurch is contemporary and distinct. There is no nostalgia, no dubby decay or wistfulness, locked up in <i>Cold Spring</i>. This alone is refreshing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Cold Spring</i> succeeds because Maker and Campos go out of their way to foil their default, kempt state. The most noticeable example of which is the addition of King Krule, a.k.a. gravel-voiced youngster Archy Marshall. His churlish, marble-mouthed tone is so at odds with the Kimbie universe that when it first arrives, during the opening moments of ""You Took Your Time"", it sounds like someone aggressively tousling the band's meticulously combed hair. Krule is a magnetic presence, fronting on a murder-- ""Now did you see me/ I killed a man""-- and slowly chewing words over a distended synthesizers and thin percussion, resulting in something of a grime ballad. When he returns later on ""Meter, Pale, Tone"" he expertly summarizes the odd, personal charm of Mount Kimbie: ""Crack a toe/ It was the loudest of sounds.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Make and Campos take turns at the mic themselves, reprising the blocky sing-chants of ""Maybes"" to pleasant effect. It reminds me of shape-note singing in its pacing and expression: limited voices, irregular melodic shifts. It's not pop music, but on tracks like lead single ""Made to Stray"" and ""Blood and Form"" their voices balance on the arrangements' edges and tightrope to the finish. The instrumental tracks have a broader, almost post-rock feel to them, offering jazzy percussion, needle-threaded bass workouts, and heaving atmospheres. The resplendent ""Break Well"" and the closing ""Fall Out"" prove them still capable of erratic beauty.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For these gains they've sacrificed some of their agility, the crisp snaps and cracks of <i>Crooks &amp; Lovers</i>, and their easy self-containment. But <i>Cold Spring</i> is miles from epic or strained, and it's comfortable with its imbalance. It feels like a personal triumph: On album two Mount Kimbie were a smidge more ambitious, something that will be true whether or not the outside world deigns to notice.</span></p></div>"|18061.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18061-mount-kimbie-cold-spring-fault-less-youth/|7.7|Andrew Gaerig

While creating, producing, and performing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14433-cerulean/""><i>Cerulean </i></a>by himself<i> </i>may have been a declaration of independence at one point, he soon felt trapped and limited behind his MPDs, unable to fully connect with crowds, and mislabeled as a ""DJ."" More crucially, his physical frame was failing him. Last year, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8994-baths"">a debilitating bout with E. coli</a> rendered him incapable of eating or getting out of bed, let alone creating new music. After slowly convalescing, he channeled all of these pent-up frustrations and desires-- for escape, for artistic growth, for transformation, for death, for self-actualization-- into <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/114-obsidian/"" target=""_blank"">Obsidian</a>. </i>And by doing so, he didn’t just create his second album. He made an evil twin.</p>
<p>While <i>Obsidian</i> maintains some aspects of <i>Cerulean, </i>namely, its lap-pop intimacy<i> </i>and Wiesenfeld's unsteady, quavering vocals, the shock is in hearing him make a complete heel turn, fearlessly operating like someone absolved of personal repercussion or culpability: He pursues every gnarly musical idea, every perverted lyric. <i>Cerulean </i>gave no indication as to how much<i> </i>range Wiesenfeld could cover working exclusively in purple and pitch black. Over the sickly, chain-gang lurch of “Worsening”, Wiesenfeld's weary recitations serve as both an introduction to his newly florid, morbid poetry, and <i>Obsidian</i>’s thesis statement-- “Birth was like a fat black tongue/ Dripping tar and dung and dye/ Slowly into my shivering eyes."" As to be expected from someone whose body was recently powerless over the most basic functions, Wiesenfeld sees death in everything. Tall rock shelves and an overcast atmosphere are viewed as exits to the afterlife on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15087-miasma-sky/"" target=""_blank"">“Miasma Sky”</a>, an advance single that gave the impression that Baths’ idea of pop was a suicidal version of what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"" target=""_blank"">the Postal Service</a> do. He can’t prevent himself from being sucked into the ground as the molten, heavy metal banger “Earth Death” creates its own gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Throughout, the songs on <i>Obsidian</i> are physical in a literal sense, mimicking the human motion of the characters described therein. The collation of disparate layers on “Worsening” is simply astonishing, so many parts going in gawky, arrhythmic directions to form a fearsome, fluid whole. The illicit love affair on “Ironworks” moves to a limpid Satie-like piano figure of incapacitating beauty, containing all the sadness, longing, and tenderness the two feel for each other. Meanwhile, the stunning breadth of <i>Obsidian </i>becomes apparent as “Incompatible” skulks forward, non-quantized rhythms emphasizing the fumbled communication and resentments of an ice-cold relationship. </p>
<p>The physicality and darkness aren’t just borne out of a 24-year-old’s first brush with death. <i>Obsidian </i>is in some aspect a “grown up” record in that the characters<i> </i>find themselves in adult situations. But they aren’t mature by any means. In fact, the sexual conduct is fueled by as much nihilism as the apocalyptic conjuring. This is really where <i>Obsidian </i>feels less like a typical artistic “leap” than a bold leap of faith. Vocally, Wisenfeld was a bit player on <i>Cerulean</i>, and often would whisper sweet little love notes: “Please tell me you need me,” “I still smell you, distance aside.” On “Ironworks,” he likens himself to “Sweet swine/ In Victorian doorways/ In tempestuous foreplay,” and that’s as cute as things get.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it’s brutal stuff: anonymous sex is pursued and consummated in a manner as merciless and cold as the mechanical animal beat of “No Eyes”: “It is not a matter of if you mean it/ But it is only a matter of come and fuck me.” Even more unsettling is “Incompatible”, which is of a piece with “No Eyes”, the same poisonous self-seeking and carnal misconduct brought much closer to home. Wiesenfeld deftly sets the scene by utilizing the connotations embedded in the unflattering aspects of cohabitation-- a shared toilet seat, an unmade bed with “covers in divisive heaps.” From there on out, he plays a manipulative, abusive, loveless lover where the sexual demands (“Nights you roll over and introduce yourself/ Nurse this erection back to full health”) are somehow less cruel than the gutwrenching asides you might hear at the dinner table: “You don’t do anything with your life /I could prod your hurt all night.” While the narrator admits, “I was never poetic and I was never kind,” only half rings true for Wiesenfeld.</p>
<p>These wouldn’t be shocking lyrics within the catalogs of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4683-xiu-xiu/"" target=""_blank"">Xiu Xiu</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/"" target=""_blank"">Perfume Genius</a>, who, if not peers, are certainly precedents for the immersive, ornate, and homoerotic songwriting Baths engages in here. But provocation is a main goal for Jamie Stewart and Mike Hadreas, who maintain deadly serious and combative personae on and off-record; they push buttons and boundaries, but in doing so, they allow their work and its subject matter to be considered “outsider art,” easily spotted and easily avoided. Though Wiesenfeld is very <a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/2010-07-01/music/baths-the-great-escape/full/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">open and candid about his sexuality</a>, the predominant image he’s cast is that of a constantly smiling, muttonchopped young man who gushes about anime and Skyrim on <a href=""https://twitter.com/BATHSmusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>. In that sense, the gregarious and genial Wiesenfeld has created a more subversive work by getting uncomfortably close to pop, confronting closed minds with what they don’t want to believe-- that the supposedly impure or deviant behavior described in “No Eyes” or “Incompatible” or “Ironworks” isn’t relegated to any race, class, gender, or sexual orientation, that it can’t be simply ignored or pinned on the outwardly misanthropic. Whether it’s repressed or engaged with as powerfully as it is on <i>Obsidian, </i>the dark matter lives inside all of us. If you hear <i>Obsidian </i>and think, “I didn’t know he had it in him,” what sticks is how he makes you wonder if you have “it” in you as well.</p></div>"|18065.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18065-baths-obsidian/|8.6|Ian Cohen

Do you consider yourself a regular person with no superhuman skill just trying to carve out a happy corner of the world? You could be a Pastel. Their albums-- from the scrappy noise-pop of 1987's <i>Up For a Bit with the Pastels </i>or 1989's <i>Sittin Pretty</i>, through the subtle, atmospheric sounds of 1997's <i>Illumination</i>-- are almost defiantly intimate. Topics of a Pastels song might include the importance of friendship and how nice it can be to walk around the city at night. In more than one interview, McRobbie has worried they would be remembered as the ultimate underachievers.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/116-slow-summits/"" target=""_blank""><i>Slow Summits</i></a> is their first proper album in 16 years. (Their last release was a 2009 split LP with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9399-tenniscoats/"" target=""_blank"">Tenniscoats</a> titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13463-two-sunsets/"" target=""_blank""><i>Two Sunsets</i></a>.) Here people watch airplanes from the porches of their parents' house and stare at old drawings of older friends. They compare themselves to small piles of rocks behind neglected railroad tracks, lit by distant light. They kiss, hug, and wonder if anyone notices them, but rarely speak loud enough to be heard. ""We are missed, but we exist,"" McRobbie sings near the end of the album, his voice low and bashful, less a singer and more someone drunkenly telling you how great they think you are.</p>
<p>Like <i>Illumination</i>, <i>Slow Summits </i>marries the rough naïveté of indie pop with soft, jazzy music influenced by 1960s artists like Burt Bacharach or the Free Design-- music whose pleasant immediacy is actually the product of sophisticated planning. Each wayward handclap and casual jangle of guitar is matched with tight, brushed drums and pro-grade violin. Credit goes to Chicago studio head and multi-instrumentalist John McEntire, who captures each sigh and flourish in vivid clarity. For a band that once seemed borderline unable to play their instruments, latter-day Pastels records feature an awful lot of impeccably recorded French horns.</p>
<p>""Rain is falling on a European street,"" Katrina Mitchell sings in the album's opening minute; ""park your car outside and be discreet."" Her voice is gentle and grainy, not a whisper but almost one-- a voice reserved for the house, or maybe the bed. Like former Olympia band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/531-beat-happening/"" target=""_blank"">Beat Happening</a> or countrymates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a>, the Pastels are part of a strain of indie-pop whose sweetness is backlit by mystery and lust. In the role-reversing traditions of indie-pop, it's Mitchell who asserts herself while McRobbie sounds lost in daydreams. The album's most direct, upbeat songs-- ""Check My Heart"" and ""Come to the Dance""-- are hers. When McRobbie's voice joins her on the last line of ""Secret Music,"" it's like he's been hiding on the sidelines, too shy to come out. Ultimately, though, McRobbie finds his moment. Against the brisk, carefree backbeat of ""Night Time Made Us"", he confesses, ""I wanted to steal something that was already mine."" In case the idea wasn't clear, he repeats it, emphatically, before disappearing into a refrain of cascading flutes.</p>
<p>In a certain sense, the Pastels are a punk band, or a band that has always privileged punk values: community, equality, the homegrown and self-directed. But whatever politics the band holds are implicit. It's difficult to imagine the Pastels raging against any machine. It's easy, however, to imagine them turning away from the machine entirely. They've been doing it for 25 years. Like all Pastels albums, <i>Slow Summits </i>feels like the work of a tightly knit gang of outcasts. Together they roam familiar streets, checking out the public tennis courts and town center, armed with the knowledge that the deepest mysteries are the ones we barely notice and the greatest adventures are ones taken closest to home.</p>
<p>No wonder time has pegged them as underachievers. There's no glory in embracing what's already in your arms, no drama in uncovering what's already there. Instead there's tenderness, care, and humility, none of which have ever been particularly marketable. As Stuart Murdoch sang on Belle and Sebastian's ""We Rule the School,"" ""Call me a prophet if you want / It's no secret / You know the world was made for men and not us."" So they went out in the middle of the night and made a new one.</p></div>"|18056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18056-the-pastels-slow-summits/|7.9|Mike Powell

<p><i>Vertical XL </i>is even more soulful and warm than his <i>Dreama </i>material, the kind of beats that would work wonders under a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a> verse or a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29414-katy-b/"" target=""_blank"">Katy B</a> performance. Not to fantasy-book collaborators or anything, but it really does fit the moment, and leadoff cut “Bank Head” rises to the occasion. Its appearance as an instrumental on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17572-night-slugs-allstars-volume-2/"" target=""_blank""><i>Night Slugs Allstars Volume 2</i></a> was a red herring: there were plenty of icily glowing synthpop homages to carry it, but it feels more like a complete piece now that the final version adds vocals that complement its tense austerity. Singer Kelela, an Angeleno with an upcoming mixtape on Kingdom's Night Slugs sister label Fade to Mind, pulls off a name-making performance as the initially delicate, increasingly impassioned voice that draws out, complements, and then drastically expands on the longing frustration of the track. </p>
<p>Maybe it's the strong impression that “Bank Head” makes, but from there on out the rest of the EP's alt-pop, hip-hop and R&amp;B tendencies jump to the forefront. The pull between deep percussive bass and the beats he <i>doesn't </i>drop continue to give his work a simultaneously heavy and aerodynamic sparseness, a groove too clean to be chaotic but too forceful to really be minimal. And that approach-- intricacy in the service of simplicity-- is a good environment for his hookier tendencies to emerge. Even when things get moody, they don't need a lot of coaxing to get danceable: the chain-clanking, plinking-water darkness that sets off “Corpse” is overwhelmed by machine-gun kicks and synths that toe the line between foreboding and intimate, and the minor-chord moan of “Viper Lash” has enough hopped-up percussive interplay piercing the surface to make it more thrilling than gloomy.</p>
<p>When it's at its most explicitly future-pop stylized, the music takes on some of Kingdom's best tendencies. The sparse, heavy-foot loping “OG Master” isn't exactly a good-mood pool-party soundtrack on its own, but the speaker-rattling resemblance to some of the more iconoclastic space-rap beats to emerge from grime-savvy Southern and West Coast underground producers works in its favor. And even through all the characteristically dense drum programming and intense forward motion, the heart of “Viper XL” is a juxtaposition of synthpop and old-school house that lets him construct some of his most euphoric melodies yet. Kingdom's still a relatively low-profile entity-- for now, at least-- but he does what pop musicians should do: build, reinterpret, transform, and revel in the possibilities of a long lineage of dance music. That he does so with only one vocal track makes it clear that his own voice is just getting stronger.</p></div>"|18043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18043-kingdom-vertical-xl-ep/|8.2|Nate Patrin

Even the robot rockers in Daft Punk are using their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">rare press appearances</a> to extol the virtues of using real, live sentient beings to perform on their new record. But don’t expect When Saints Go Machine to join the uprising; the Danish quartet don’t just embrace electronics, they surrender to them. The band’s previous two releases inspired no lack of synth-pop descriptors, but for them, the synthesizer is a literal concept-- an interface that allows them to truly fuse the human and the artificial, and translate emotions into digital frequencies and vice versa. Their band name may have started out as an awkward pun, but at its core lies a certain modernness-is-next-to-godliness ideology.</p>
<p>On <i>Infinity Pool</i>, When Saints Go Machine treat their songs very much as machines-- i.e., mechanical objects that are constantly rewired and reassembled into new forms and functions. But as with any science-lab experiment, the process is as arduous as it is illuminating. Both in terms of the internal song components and the tracklist as a whole, <i>Infinity Pool</i> comes off as disjointed, as if we’re hearing the band piece the tracks together in real time without a manual and hope the final product holds together. In Nikolaj Vonsild’s processed voice, there's a palpable sense of wonder at his ability to transform his new-romantic croon into a sad-robot warble. But that curious quality ultimately proves to be the album’s undoing-- in that the band seem so enamored with the sounds they’re emitting, they often lose sight of the songs. </p>
<p>Ironically, the odd-couple pairing with Killer Mike on lead single “Love &amp; Respect” results in <i>Infinity Pool</i>’s most fully realized moment, its gothic strings and gritty boom-bap beat effectively bridging the gap between the Atlanta rapper’s streetwise swagger and Vonsild’s trembling murmur. (Plus, it’s a lot more fun and catchy than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi5_iYbZjEc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2013’s other fey/gangsta hybrid</a>.) However, the fact it’s featured here as the opener only magnifies its complete disconnect from the rest of the album, which deemphasizes rhythm and concision in favor of ominous bass drones, doodling synths, and perpetually rearranging melodies that often feel at odds with the music trying to support them.</p>
<p>Compared to the relatively streamlined electro-pop of 2011’s <i>Konkylie</i>, <i>Infinity Pool</i> is decidedly darker and a more demanding a listen. When their vision comes into focus, When Saints Go Machine are capable of some arresting moments-- the beaming chorus of “System of Unlimited Love” and the clattering climax of “Slave to Your Take in Heaven,” in particular-- but they take a fair amount of trudging through moody, meandering passages to get there. And the album’s sense of gravitas is continually undermined by the undue emphasis on Vonsild’s fragile voice, which is over-modulated to the point of sounding cartoonish, like Antony Hegarty karate-chopping his own throat to produce a faux underwater effect. There’s much to admire about When Saints Go Machine’s effort to move their synth-powered pop music away from the dancefloor into more cerebral realms. But like the band name itself, their attempts at cleverness can come off sounding clunky.</p></div>"|18055.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18055-when-saints-go-machine-infinity-pool/|5.5|Stuart Berman

Track the activities of scene pillars like Matthew Shipp and William Parker, and younger luminaries such as Craig Taborn and Jeremy Pelt, and Cleaver, now 50, will never be far behind. He's well documented as a bandleader too, with three fine full-lengths stretching back to 2001, all issued by connoisseur-friendly Barcelona label <a href=""http://www.freshsoundrecords.com/fresh_sound_new_talent-rl-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fresh Sound New Talent</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But jazz is only one facet of Cleaver's aesthetic. In the past, he's engaged with the genre's time-tested traditions-- his second album, 2008's<i> Detroit</i>, was both deeply conventional and highly satisfying-- but as early as his 2001 debut, <i>Adjus</i>t, he'd marked himself as a bandleader who values free-form textural exploration as much as an orderly progression of solos. For his new, fourth record,<i> Life in the Sugar Candle Mines</i>, released under the group name Black Host, he partners with a label that shares his broad vision. The Northern Spy roster includes avant-jazz heavyweights such as Charles Gayle (a longtime Cleaver associate), as well as Zs, Rhys Chatham, Hubble and other conceptually minded artists who have carved out personal niches that transcend genre. The album's engineer and mixer, Bryce Goggin, whose credits include Pavement, Antony and the Johnsons, and Phish, fits neatly into this expansive company.</p>
<p>The supporting cast is another tip-off that Cleaver is broadening his scope. The drummer's earlier bandleading sessions drew mostly from his peer group, but in Black Host, he's assembled an intergenerational all-star quintet, featuring three of NYC's most volatile, expressive improvisers. Saxist Darius Jones and guitarist Brandon Seabrook come equipped with heavy-duty punk-fusion credentials-- Jones plays in the harrowing collective quartet Little Women, and Seabrook leads his own raw, frenetic trio, Seabrook Power Plant-- while pianist Cooper-Moore (a.k.a. Gene Ashton, a longtime collaborator of the late saxophone force David S. Ware) has established himself over three-plus decades as an alternately tender and terrifying player.</p>
<p>It's telling that Cleaver's name isn't on the marquee. <i>Life in the Sugar Candle Mines</i> features some outstanding drumming, but the leader's core concept here is to let his formidable cast loose and see how the players combust, both with each other and with a wide array of compositional tactics, from crunchy, choppy jazz rock to hazy psychedelic ambiance. The results are sprawling and sometimes draining, but overall, Cleaver's gamble succeeds. The record exudes a raw, otherworldly beauty that you won't find anywhere else in contemporary music, jazz or otherwise. (The Tony Williams Lifetime's <i>Emergency!</i> and other gritty late-60s/early-70s fusion statements are a definite touchstone, but the record doesn't invest seriously in retro allusion.) Black Host's music is a well-tended hot-house: feverish and bracingly weird, yet also purposeful and shrewdly strategic.</p>
<p>Opener ""Hover"" is a brilliant collision of form and chaos. The piece starts with a nod to ecstatic 60s free jazz, the instruments roiling and mingling, but soon Cleaver segues into a driving, waltz-time backbeat; like elements of a blurry photo slowly coming into focus, the players unite in a gnarled yet triumphant theme, with Seabrook's amp-frying tone heightening the punk-gone-gospel mood. The track crossfades ingeniously between blaring and pastoral modes.</p>
<p>""Citizen Rose"", one of several ballad-like pieces on the record, functions as an effective counterweight to the likes of ""Hover"", and ""Ayler Children"", which builds to a climax that's closer in feel to U.S. Maple's heady mid-90s avant-rock than the expressionist praise music of the piece's namesake. Jones, Seabrook, and Cooper-Moore (on synth) float through the ""Citizen Rose"" theme in a group trance, urged on by Cleaver's exquisitely patient brushwork. The improvisational section that follows is the opposite of traditional jazz solo practice, where each player takes a turn out front; instead it's an ambient psych soup, with Seabrook's disembodied twang and Pascal Niggenkemper's moaning arco bass bubbling up from the murk.</p>
<p>There's no getting around the fact that <i>Life in the Sugar Candle Mines</i> is a demanding record, full of lengthy, exploratory performances. (Of the eight tracks here, four crack the 10-minute mark and none are significantly shorter than six.) Most of the time, that's a good thing; the stretching feels urgent, a key component of the weird spell Cleaver and co. are casting. ""Gromek"" is an exception. The woolly psych-jazz meditation, which builds from a rustle to a roar over the course of nearly 13 minutes, lacks a coherent narrative thrust.</p>
<p>The album ends on a quietly stunning note, with the slow-blooming ballad ""May Be Home"". In an ingenious arrangement move, Cleaver effectively splits the quintet into two overlapping sub-groups. The track begins with a ghostly Jones/Seabrook duet, which recalls the spectral seances that saxist Joe Lovano and guitarist Bill Frisell conducted in their long-running trio with late drumming master Paul Motian. The focus then shifts to the piano-bass-drums trio. Cooper-Moore eases into a balletic, free-floating reverie, virtuosic but not the slightest bit showy, that might be the record's single most arresting passage. Cleaver rustles tastefully in the background, demonstrating again what an unconventionally effective bandleader he is.</p>
<p>For an open-minded listener not attuned to present-day jazz, <i>Life in the Sugar Candle Mines</i> is an excellent entry point. It's too idiosyncratic to typify any broader movement, but it transmits the untamed energy of the contemporary New York scene. The album never panders with obvious genre cues; Cleaver simply gathers the sounds and textures he needs from various sources and blends them without fuss. More importantly, he does right by the essential tenets of jazz bandleading: Give your bandmates a clear, compelling blueprint and embrace their spontaneous revisions. The result is an exemplary study in fantastical form, and the humanistic detonation thereof.</p></div>"|18085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18085-black-host-life-in-the-sugar-candle-mines/|7.6|Hank Shteamer

On computers in the post-Napster landscape, guitar-rock intermingled with avant-garde classical music as well as “clicks’n’cuts,” which in turn could mix with twee indie rock and the thumps of backpack rap. After <i>Kid A, </i>analog components could fuck with guitars and laptops and soon a slew of new artists were pushing beyond these genre distinctions: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2031-dfa-records-presents-compilation-1/"" target=""_blank"">DFA’s discopunk was already afoot</a>, Jim O’Rourke had morphed from resplendent indie-pop fingerpicker to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6041-im-happy-and-im-singing-and-a-1-2-3-4/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">laptop noisenik</a>, a producer from Florida named Diplo was mashing together <a href=""http://youtu.be/QfZKyTld2Mo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">heavy psychedelic rock breaks</a> into something for rap heads, while underground hip-hop was getting strange and musty thanks to Madlib’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6610-the-unseen/"" target=""_blank"">myriad personas</a>.</p>
<p>The Class of 2003 also offered up three upcoming producers who embraced every sound on their hard drives and within one month that year, they all released their breakthrough efforts. There was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"" target=""_blank"">Prefuse 73</a>’s <i>One Word Extinguisher</i>, the soon-to-be-renamed-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"" target=""_blank"">Caribou</a>’s <i>Up in Flames</i>, and Four Tet's <i>Rounds</i>. The first melded IDM’s glitches to backpacker breaks while the second mashed it to psychedelic sunshine pop; <i>Rounds</i>, the third album for Kieran Hebden's project, grabbed at all of the above while also including jazz and folk. For the listeners out there who knew Hebden from his days in instrumental post-rock outfit Fridge and who might have considered his early recordings under the name of Four Tet as more of a side attraction than main gig, <i>Rounds</i> announced the arrival of one of electronic music’s vanguard producers.</p>
<p>The album opened with a recording of a dog’s heartbeat before Hebden lets it bloom into free meter drum rolls that evoked the amoebic pulses that defined late 60s experimental jazz before tightening it all up with a beat that headnodded at hip-hop without quite being beholden to it. That three distinct rhythms (cardiac, jazz, hip-hop) could effortlessly convene on “Hands” augured Hebden’s formidable beat skills, which even in the present tense pull from house, 2-step, Afrobeat, and dubstep while remaining singular.</p>
<p>It makes sense that Hebden so easily drew from multiple genres. As he revealed in a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9132-four-tet/"">interview</a>, <i>Rounds</i> was comprised entirely of samples. But that he draws from the most arcane source material available speaks to Hebden’s touch; on <i>Rounds</i>, his obscure sources serve the overall poignancy of the music. So while “She Moves She” retains the crisp snare and hi-hat work that underpinned millennial R&amp;B productions, it’s the twinkling glockenspiel line that gives the track its emotional heft. Same for the harp line that intermingles with the iron lung beat of “My Angel Rocks Back and Forth.” Sampledelic or not, Four Tet’s music feels personal rather than patchwork.</p>
<p>The media catchphrase for mixing the pastoral airs of folk music with electronic music’s low-end became “folktronica,” a term Hebden detested and kicked against with each subsequent release. He embraced the fiery, brassy tones of spiritual jazz for his follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3168-everything-ecstatic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Everything Ecstatic</i></a> and soon after began collaborating in earnest with free jazz drummer Steve Reid (while also producing for folk-jazz-noise-nonsense freewheelers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3980-sunburned-hand-of-the-man/"" target=""_blank"">Sunburned Hand of the Man</a>). And when that generation-gap crossing collaboration ended with Reid’s passing in 2010, Hebden dove headfirst into modern dance music, taking in two-step, jungle, dubstep, techno and house, reconfiguring these heavier rhythms into something suiting his own manner. And as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17093-pink/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pink</i></a> recently showed, Four Tet’s knack for instantly-identifiable melody remains undiluted, no matter how strong and dancefloor-filling his new tracks are.</p>
<p>While touring for <i>Rounds</i>, Hebden began to slough off the “folk” tag of his live shows, pushing at the parameters of what a laptop could do onstage. The bonus disc on this 10th anniversary edition of Rounds reveals him at the height of his powers. Recorded live in Copenhagen, it finds Hebden taking the melodies and beanie-nodding rhythms of <i>Rounds</i> further and further out into the cosmos. “She Moves She” dilates from four to 10 minutes, with Hebden finding new pockets of space amid the string twangs and kick to add skittering samples and blurs of noise. A metallophone sample similarly gets rubberbanded-- at times resounding like a Balinese gamelan orchestra, other times flickering in even patterns like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Reich</a>’s <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i>-- before turning into “Spirit Fingers”.</p>
<p>The most astounding transformation occurs on “As Serious As Your Life”. The track’s taut drum break suddenly has Tibetan chimes, ghost notes, scraped strings, and electroacoustic gurgles mingle with its snare and hi-hat before the recognizable part of the song drops. But soon Hebden mutates it into a 15-minute monster that gobbles up every single genre tag in the process, until it’s a dervish of noise. As the original album proved and this reissue reinforces, Four Tet showed a new generation of listeners that much like 60s jazz before him-- which could embody soul, gospel, blues and primal howls while still sounding like “The New Thing”-- 21st century laptop music could be as serious as your life, too.</p></div>"|18050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18050-four-tet-rounds/|8.9|Andy Beta

While all that was going on, they were also working on <i>Crawling Up the Stairs</i>, the follow-up to their splendidly hazy debut LP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15575-pleasure/"">Pleasure</a></i>. Instead of recording everything live as they did before, Pure X took an arduous year-and-a-half to record <i>C.U.T.S.</i>, as they call it, sparing no attention to detail.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Where <i>Pleasure</i><i> </i>unfurls like a drop of ink in a glass of water, <i>Crawling Up the Stairs</i> has a plan. ""There's kind of a hard descent,"" Jenkins <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2013/05/14/interview-pure-x/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a>, ""and the rest of the record is a slow ascent back up to reality."" Pure X also made a studied departure from the feedback and reverb that occasionally muffled <i>Pleasure</i>'s finer textures. On <i>Crawling Up the Stairs</i>, they looked for guitar sounds <a href=""http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/pure-x-one-night-i-had-a-true-battle-with-what-jung-called-the-shadow-self-and-what-i-would-call-a-demon-123800"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""like glass knives slicing through your eardrums,""</a> influenced by Nashville's golden era of high-polish production, and honed in producer Larry Seyer's studio, Electric Larryland. The diamond-cut dulcimer that opens <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15363-pure-x-thousand-year-old-child/"">""Thousand Year Old Child""</a> sounds more at home <a href=""http://vimeo.com/65254827#"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on a sunlit Brooklyn rooftop</a> than the dark, dusty Texas basements in which it originated, and the bowed piano splintering the end of ""Never Alone"" feels almost three-dimensional. When the guitars do squall, they radiantly explode into being instead of burning low and dirty, as they did on Pure X's earlier releases.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sometimes this clarity comes at the expense of the smoldering noise that made their last album so sensual, but Pure X make up for lost immediacy by giving a lot more attention to <i>Crawling</i>'s vocals. Rustling whispers and conspiratorial voices on ""Shadows and Lies"" are the perfect companions to Grace's rangy, paranoid wails. In fact, it's almost a relief to hear him totally lose it for once, howling himself ragged on ""How Did You Find Me"" instead of keeping his voice at a safely reverbed distance from the listener. After Grace rips his throat apart, Jenkins-- who, for the first time, shares singing duties-- is there to pick up the pieces with his sweet and haunting falsetto. Despite Grace's injuries, it's Jenkins who sings, ""The pain in my body is so great"" on ""I Fear What I Feel"", reaching high octaves of pain repeated across several lines like a dull, throbbing ache.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-41a4fadb-cf7c-8da8-a253-bc9ad88062d9"">Jenkins has said Pure X won't make their next record the same way they made <i>Crawling Up the Stairs</i>, which makes sense-- how many times can a band have a collective nervous breakdown?-- but hopefully they'll find a few takeaways from the creative process behind their second album. It may not be as instantly gratifying as <i>Pleasure</i>, but it's more sophisticated and self-aware.</span></p></div>"|17998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17998-pure-x-crawling-up-the-stairs/|7.0|Harley Brown

Not that Saturday bossman Fred Thomas hasn't kept himself busy, forming the dreamy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27989-city-center/"" target=""_blank"">City Center</a> and issuing a couple Neil Young-ish LPs under his own name. Thomas, ever the compartmentalizer, largely abandoned the sweeping romance of Saturday's Motown-and-Northern Soul-inflected indie-pop, letting his most famous project fall by the wayside in order to pursue these noisier, rootsier stylings. But, though many, him included, thought <i>Fill Up the Room</i> would remain the last Saturday LP, the songs that wound up on <i>One Kiss Ends It All</i> would sound awfully strange from any other Thomas project. Despite their fluid personnel-- Thomas frequently recruits new singers for each Saturday LP-- the idea of what a Saturday song is and isn't hasn't changed: great big hooks, peculiar little emotions. </p>
<p>That said, <i>One Kiss Ends It All</i> doesn't exactly pick up where <i>Fill Up the Room</i> left off. With the benefit of hindsight, <i>Fill Up</i> seems something of an outlier in the Saturday catalog, having straightened out some of the blurrier edges that marked the band's earlier work. <i>One Kiss</i>, on the other hand, nudges the frame, casting everything at a slightly odd angle. Little scratches and pops abound deep in the mix, vocals get warped halfway through verses, saxophones collide headlong into strings. The whole thing's just silly with melody. The warm, wistful <i>One Kiss</i> plays like a dodgy mixtape of lonesome teenage classics dubbed over so many times that ""Where Did Our Love Go?"" is starting to bleed through ""The Stars of Track and Field"".</p>
<p>Amidst all these instrumental crinkles, <i>One Kiss</i> is best at its most direct. The jaunty ""New City"" takes a rather a slash-and-burn stance on public policy: ""The city's falling apart,"" new recruit Carol Catherine sings, ""It's time to build a new city,"" a hard-to-miss allusion to the ailing Detroit some of Saturday call home. ""Are You Kissing Anyone?"" is pure vaseline-on-lens, achey last-dance-at-prom stuff.</p>
<p>When that directness falters, so does everything else. Thomas' occasional overreliance on metaphor muddies the sentiments at the heart of some of these tracks, and a couple songs find him mixing the vocals low enough as to render their words virtually incomprehensible; one wonders why he'd invite somebody over to sing only to bury the take in reverb. Vocally, Thomas is in fine company throughout <i>One Kiss</i>, but between the constant turnover behind the microphone and all that instrumental foofaraw, <i>One Kiss</i> sometimes feels a little overstuffed. ""Negative Space"", ironically enough, gets the worst of it; after a stirring verse, the song dips into spacey ambience, essentially killing time before its rousing climax. The good songs on <i>One Kiss</i> are constantly reshuffling themselves, shifting fidelities, rearranging instruments; the couple of really great ones (""New City"", ""Sunglasses"") seem to dispose with all the fuss and get right to the point.</p>
<p>Still, when words fail Thomas and company, their music rarely does. Despite the rough patches, <i>One Kiss</i> is largely rich and rousing, quick to grab your ear even when it fails to snag your emotions. It's not always easy to put names to the in-between feelings Thomas explores with Saturday Looks Good to Me: not just love, but yearning; not just missing someone, but the way that someone you're missing can start to feel like a specter, an ""Invisible Friend"". Thomas occasionally puts too many layers between himself and the listener, and it's not always easy to tell what he means to say, particular when most of it's being said by someone else. But throughout <i>One Kiss</i>, it's obvious how much Thomas missed writing these stirring, expansive, romantic pop songs for Saturday Looks Good to Me. Even as they sputter through certain emotions, that longing comes through loud and clear.</p></div>"|18031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18031-saturday-looks-good-to-me-one-kiss-ends-it-all/|7.0|Paul Thompson

His prior work, both on his own and with sometime partner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30373-dean-blunt-inga-copeland/"">Inga Copeland</a>, varied wildly in quality, finally reaching a dead end with last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17377-the-narcissist-ii/""><i>The Narcissist II</i></a>, a half-assed tribute to half-assedness. Where do you go from there? For Blunt, the answer is to lose the dopey feel of his prior records, strip away the layers of fuzz, and etch out a set of short ballads that form something resembling a relationship crisis album. There are occasional diversions-- distraught voicemail messages, clocks chiming ominously-- but much of <i>The Redeemer</i> assimilates the feel of someone slumped over a bar, reading the last rites on a romance.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing this album does is pose a few questions about substance and how it's ascribed. Does Dean Blunt now come with added ""weight"" due to sad horn solos, sweeping strings, and the sound of hands running up and down harp strings? No, not really. Often it sounds like someone keenly aware of the trappings of music that reads as ""heartbroken,"" and how to manipulate them. At least it occasionally seems like there's genuine hurt there, sometimes from a twist in Blunt's voice, or a passage of particularly weepy piano playing. But most of the songs are half-formed and barely able to gain any momentum, strangled by track lengths that clock in around the one- or two-minute mark. There's a strong sense of something as transient as the <i>Narcissist</i> material, just dressed up in different clothing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <i>The Redeemer</i> isn't just an elongated comment on how heavily certain devices have been leaned on throughout music history. On a song like ""Demon"", tellingly one of the longest here, Blunt ties together vocal manipulations, sound collage, pounding drums, and even a softly tooting trumpet solo. It finds room to bridge between Blunt's prior inclinations for haze and the roomier ones he works in here. His work as an arranger is often skilled, even if the end result either can't or won't get beyond feeling like a simple exercise. ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" is his attempt at a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12852-histoire-de-melody-nelson/""><i>Histoire de Melody Nelson</i></a> cut; ""Make It Official"" briefly dips into woozy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4025-david-sylvian/"">David Sylvian</a> territory. Even Inga Copeland, possibly the person cast as Blunt's subject matter, surfaces on the title track, although her appearance lacks any dramatic élan. <i>The Redeemer</i> is too cynical an enterprise for that, always stopping short of actually feeling very much.</p>
<p>There is some worth in giving common musical tropes a kicking, although Blunt's approach-- essentially swilling the dregs of balladry around in his mouth and spewing them out-- too often ends up more flaccid than the style he's referencing. <i>The Redeemer</i> ends up somewhere between sarcasm and sensitivity, but can't dig deep enough in either direction to provide something that's worth returning to. The fragmented nature of the tracks, where ideas are set in motion and just trail off into insubstantial thought, can't get to the genesis of what makes material like this work. Pop that comments on pop needs to have a thorough understanding of the form in order to function. As a consequence, it doesn't really matter whether this is Blunt making a genuine attempt at recording a break-up album or using it as a framework to illustrate how vacuous such a gesture can be. Whatever he was looking for, he hasn't found it here.</p></div>"|17956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17956-dean-blunt-the-redeemer/|6.1|Nick Neyland

There’s the seesawing groan of a squeaky door, low, crunching keyboards, and a hectic, roiling drumbeat that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6364-zach-hill/"" target=""_blank"">Zach Hill</a> wouldn't be ashamed of. When you listen closely, you realize there are words to Rubinos’ scrambled ululations: “When you get the feelin’ that you’re startin’ to wake up,” she trills, like an alarm. “Something I really wanted on this record, and in general, is exuberance,” the young Brooklyn-dwelling singer told <a href=""http://rookiemag.com/2013/05/whirlwind/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rookie</i></a> recently. She's triumphed unambiguously: <i>Magic Trix</i> is a startling lightning bolt of a record.</p>
<p>There are four primary parts to Rubinos’ busy sound: her electric, smoky voice; overdriven keyboards, which often seem like electric guitar but aren't; the contributions of syncopation-happy drummer Marco Buccelli and funk-inclined bassist Adam Minkoff. <i>Magic Trix</i> recalls tUnE-yArDs, Battles, Camille, and the melodies of St. Vincent’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10457-marry-me/"" target=""_blank"">Marry Me</a> </i>remade with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15813-strange-mercy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Strange Mercy</i></a>-era approach-- but true to the record’s title, Rubinos has a wizard's unique flair.</p>
<p>Rubinos is of Puerto Rican and Cuban origin, and sings in English and Spanish. (The Spanish-language songs here are either fantastical, punky jump-rope chants, or sweetly sad lullabies.) She has as much of a cool, incisive way with intimate as political matters: “Ultima” opens with a collage of beatboxed vocals, and is exhausting and soothing, like watching an extravagant display while lazing on a beach. She coolly recounts how, in Cuba, simple things like going to the bank are different enough to throw you for a moment. After an indignant, yelped chorus of “Oye, yo soy la ultima!” (“Hey, I’m the last one!” your cue to join the back of a line) she flips the sentiment back onto herself: “You know it really, really takes a long, long time/ To understand what’s going on around you/ To grow and change.”</p>
<p><i>Magic Trix</i> deals with the fear that time will destroy the things you love, but it’s not so paralyzing that you’re unable to take advantage of the new wisdoms it brings, particularly concerning romance-- and Rubinos writes sexy, surrealist love songs. On “When You Come”, her keyboards take on a seductive, sleazy tone, and she describes her crush in deliciously weird terms: “He ties my heart in knots/ Just like Polish sausages.” Her odd, folkloric intentions (also: laying an egg into his mouth) stave off her impulses to look beyond the fantasy of the guy who ""makes love to [her] like [he’s] seen something new"" <i>and</i> folds her clothes afterwards, preferring “to keep pretending/ You are the sweet thing/ I made you out to be.”</p>
<p>Navigating the balance between all-out fantasy and dulling realism is another of <i>Magic Trix</i>'s strong suits. (Rubinos channels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29567-poly-styrene/"" target=""_blank"">Poly Styrene</a> on ""Pan Y Cafe"", where she recasts the mice behind her refrigerator as Martian invaders.) On “Hair Receding”’s vibrant mathy bent, Rubinos laments the passing of time, writ in the wrinkles of a face she's starting to forget. The temperature drops on the ensuing “Cherry Tree”, where frenzied drums melt into blossoming keys, and she yells with frustration, knowing that her memory of this guy is already fading. By “Let’s Go Out”, the drums slump with dejection: She's given up trying to remember. After the tropical wilds that precede it, the synthetic, silvery keyboards here sound effectively bleak.</p>
<p>Although Rubinos’ heart is aching, she's not completely giving up on life in color; “I Like Being Alone” is a chirruping ode to solitude: “Because it means I don’t have to be something I’m not.../ Because it means I don’t have to consider you/ I can just be awful like I am/ I can be as lazy as I am.” It’s that comfort with her own ideas and company that makes <i>Magic Trix</i> so life-affirming, transcending its sound-a-likes to proudly show off a unique new pop personality. Rubinos' remarks on exuberance reminded me of something the similarly single-minded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"" target=""_blank"">Natasha Khan</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/bat-for-lashes/"" target=""_blank"">said recently</a>, about our culture emphasizing art that is ""down, dark, and fucked up-- so when there's unabashed joy, that's embarrassing for people. It's too much, or it's not cool."" If you're looking for a way out of those doldrums, then <i>Magic Trix</i> is the glitter in the dark.</p></div>"|18119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18119-xenia-rubinos-magic-trix/|7.8|Laura Snapes

A year after 2011's breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15281-badlands/"" target=""_blank""><i>Badlands</i></a> elicited comparisons to retro-damaged ancestors <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"" target=""_blank"">Suicide</a>, he released a recording of an improv-heavy performance in Norway that featured a ""loose adaptation"" of <i>Suicide</i>'s ""Ghost Rider"". Earlier this year, Hungtai shared the title track to the second disc of his new double-album, <i>Drifters</i>/<i>Love Is the Devil</i>, accompanied with a quote attributed to wastrel poet and professed inspiration Charles Bukowski: ""Love is a fog that burns with the first daylight of reality."" And the YouTube account used to host the song was an abused portmanteau of Chinese director Wong Kar-wai's name.</p>
<p>Hungtai <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8560-rising-dirty-beaches/"" target=""_blank"">told Pitchfork</a> around the time of <i>Badlands'</i> release that his media-saturated theatricality spoke to his own experience as a perpetually displaced stranger in strange lands-- he was born in Taiwan, but raised in Montreal: ""Nostalgia can be a sickness or melancholia, like how immigrants that came to North America feel homesick. I don't really have a place where I can say I was born and raised. Home is a collage of all these different, fractured landscapes that I try to piece together.""</p>
<p><i>Badlands</i> was an impressive work, but it was also sonically limited, switching almost exclusively between howling open-road antagonism and evocative, soft-focus balladry. On <i>Drifters</i>/<i>Love Is the Devil</i>,<i> </i>all previous limitations are off the table. The double album, recorded in Montreal and Brian Jonestown Massacre frontman Anton Newcombe's Berlin studio over a period of six months, is both sprawling and detailed, a sonic travelogue that takes the textural aspects of his work to impressionistic heights. Though few have heard his earlier material, Dirty Beaches' catalog is more diverse than the two-headed focus of <i>Badlands</i> suggested. But <i>Drifters</i>/<i>Love Is the Devil</i> is more robust and eccentric than anything he's ever released before.</p>
<p>This pair of albums also represents some of Hungtai's most experimental work yet, a hard left-turn from <i>Badlands</i>' song-oriented approach. There are a few excellent echoes of that previous record's sound on <i>Drifters</i>-- the junkyard roll of ""Night Walk"", ""I Dream in Neon""'s bad-vibes glow, the raw blast of ""Casino Lisboa""-- but song structure is less of a concern here. This music isn't impenetrable, but for those who listen more for song structure, it might take a few listens to lock into what Hungtai's doing. Much of the material collected on both discs-- each is about 37 minutes long and has its own title, though they are sold together-- comprises vignettes of varying length that exist in their own space. But a front-to-back listen starting with <i>Drifters</i> is the best way to take in the rich, haunting soundscapes on display.</p>
<p><i>Drifters</i>, focusing more on songs, is the more accessible record, but it's also a confrontational work. The sole instrumental, ""Belgrade"", featuring synthetic oscillations matched with a perpetually doubled-over bass line, is chilling. Its electronic textures are submerged in pools of echo, bringing to mind vast, empty spaces that create an uneasy atmosphere; ""ELLI"" is a gothic, coldwave-leaning song about aspirational love (""In my dreams I'm always with you""), while ""Aurevoir Mon Visage"" finds Hungtai shouting in French over tumbling drums and a low jet-engine roar: ""Goodbye my face/ It is nothing"".</p>
<p>And then there's ""Mirage Hall"", which towers over <i>Drifters</i> and proves its most satisfying surprise. Hungtai has flirted with electronic music before, on 2010's Night People-released cassette <i>Night City</i>, but he's never operated with this kind of scope. Over nine harrowing minutes, he and collaborators Shub Roy and Bernardino Femminielli build a thick monolith of clattering techno, broken up by ethereal moans that eventually dissolve into high-pitched howling noise. Five minutes in, Hungtai enters screaming in Spanish, his vocal performance turning from muscular to absolutely blood-curdling. </p>
<p>The weatherbeaten horns and underwater ambience of <i>Drifters</i>' closing track, ""Landscapes in the Mist"", act as something of a portal to <i>Love Is the Devil</i>'s drastic shift in sound. Hungtai has hinted that <i>Love</i> is a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9097-dirty-beaches/"">breakup album</a>, but you don't need any context to hear this music as impossibly sad and lonely.</p>
<p>By design, <i>Love Is the Devil</i> is much more abstract than its counterpart; ""Woman"" is four minutes of synth and distant, irregularly plinked piano, while the second section of ""Like the Ocean We Part"" is a minute-and-a-half of what sounds like railroad field recordings. Give it time, though, and the album reveals itself as the more impressive of the two, a dense and cinematic exploration of grief and loss that is as pretty (the title track's swelling strings) as it is desolate (""Like the Ocean We Part (I)""'s dolorous vocals and radiant, solitary guitar). The highlight of the record-- and, possibly, the collection as a whole-- is the centerpiece ""Alone at the Danube River"", a seven-minute that features a guitar solo eventully overcome<span> by waves of shimmering synths. In sound and spirit, it </span>brings to mind Neil Young's masterful soundtrack for Jim Jarmusch's gloriously empty 1995 Western <i>Dead Man.</i> </p>
<p>For me, ""Alone at the Danube River"" has an uncanny ability to lodge itself in my mind. After months of listening to <i>Drifters</i>/<i>Love Is the Devil</i>, its central guitar figure loops endlessly in my head, something I want to hum or whistle. And I think fits with Hungtai's overall artistic intention and shows why he's such an interesting artist. These records, steeped in reference and atmosphere, draw on memory but, being so textured and tactile, they bring the focus back to the present moment. </p></div>"|18076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18076-dirty-beaches-drifters-love-is-the-devil/|8.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

The duo of composer-instrumentalist Johan Angergård and wispy-voiced singer Karolina Komstedt has cycled through aspects of bedsit pop, hi-NRG chic, trip-hop noir, and quiet-is-the-new-loud bossa nova, eventually encompassing many of those within a tender, nuanced take on acoustic pop-- and that's not mentioning the pair's prior work with the twee-leaning Poprace, or Angergård's ongoing roles in the noisier Legends and lushly orchestrated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/252-acid-house-kings/"" target=""_blank"">Acid House Kings</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Above the City</i>, while as stylistically diverse as Club 8's back catalog, is once again strikingly of the moment.

That said, the record largely maintains Club 8's familiar low-key reserve, coming across as yet another natural evolution from a self-aware act that has always been endearingly off-center.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even after so many little sonic shifts over the years, <i>Above the City</i> still impresses with how adeptly Club 8 conquer new terrain.

Fellow preview track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15167-stop-taking-my-time/"" target=""_blank"">""Stop Taking My Time""</a>, with its creepy sampled chatter, finds Komstedt raising her voice to inhabit gothy 80s synths convincingly-- think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"" target=""_blank"">Robyn</a>'s ""Dancing on My Own"" if she <i>wanted </i>to be on her own, goddammnit. ""Hot Sun"" just as convincingly rolls out the beach blanket for a dubwise meditation. And the album's closing two songs are glossy stompers so uncharacteristically outsized that Angergård has said he considered sampling Queen's ""We Will Rock You"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's all done well enough to make for for Club 8's best album since 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10994-the-boy-who-couldnt-stop-dreaming/""><i>The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming</i></a>, and a sure bet to become someone's favorite.

Jones is known best as a Boston musician, having led the city’s art-rock updaters Cul de Sac through the 1990s and having alluded to his adopted hometown with the names and anecdotes of several cuts on previous records. But Jones grew up in northern New Jersey. During the last several years, he’s often returned to his childhood home for extended periods to take care of his mother, who has Alzheimer’s disease. The bulk of <i>My Garden State</i> was written during these eldercare furloughs, prompting Jones to take the thematically logical step of recording the tunes in New Jersey, too, 60 miles or so south at the farmhouse of friend and collaborator Laura Baird.</p>
<p>But this wistful 10-tune set is called <i>My</i> <i>Garden State</i>, not <i>The Garden State</i>, a clever way for Jones to sidestep songs about New Jersey so as to offer his experience with discovery, love, and loss within the state itself. Sure, the names of several numbers reference specific area locales-- <a href=""http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/tappan-zee/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Tappan Zee Bridge</a> that spans the Hudson River, the <a href=""http://www.co.bergen.nj.us"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">teeming county</a> where Jones grew up, the <a href=""http://alcoeurgardens.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nursing home</a> where his mother now lives-- but these are places that have meant something to Jones. There is no ode to the Boardwalk, no observations on the state’s industrial cornucopia, and no interpolation of “Where Eagles Dare”. Instead, these songs are intensely personal reflections on the cycle of life as he’s seen it here. “The Vernal Pool”, for instance, is an improvisation Jones played shortly after Baird showed him the farm habitat of spadefoot toads, which use the “spades” of their feet to dig into their subterranean lairs for a season’s rest. When it rains in the spring, they dig their way out and become <a href=""http://srelherp.uga.edu/anurans/scahol.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“explosive breeders.”</a> Jones saw the toads in the fall, when they still lurked underground. This piece starts with listless hibernation, his slow notes languishing inside their own decay. Across its five minutes, though, it builds into a bustle, with a thumbed bass line muscling its way through a raga-like flurry of sound. Even at its most vibrant and vivid, “The Vernal Pool” reveals a constant vein of anxiety, as if to acknowledge at once the world’s forever-chained wonder and worry while celebrating it, too.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>My Garden State</i> is defined by its sincerely bittersweet sense, where Jones never seems too mournful of or sentimental for the past nor overly naïve for some idealized future. Jones’ work isn’t emotionally conflicted; it’s simply emotionally honest, with his fingers doling out lessons as he’s learned them. These instrumentals seem to acknowledge Jones’ feelings as they are-- mixed and confusing and sometimes overwhelming, with the sweetness of childhood memories tempered by the exigencies of the present and the uncertainty of what’s ahead. “Bergen County Farewell”, written after Jones and his sisters had finally sold the family home, sublimates nostalgia into optimism and back again. Its darting melody is bright and cheery, but there’s sadness tucked between the notes, too, like a worried mind behind a well-intentioned smile. “Blues for Tom Carter”, ostensibly written for Jones’ fellow guitar traveler after the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/897-charalambides/"" target=""_blank"">Charalambides</a> co-founder<a href=""http://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/tom-carter-hospitalized-while-on-european-charalambides-tour-needs-donations-for-medical-expens"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> fell seriously ill while on tour last year</a>, doesn’t dip into full-lament mode as its title might suggest; rather, it feels like an affable Sunday afternoon phone call to an old friend, as though Jones is simply checking in to make sure everything is OK. You can imagine Carter making a wisecrack on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>Both of the album’s guitar extended guitar marvels-- the eight-minute duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5281-meg-baird/"" target=""_blank"">Meg Baird</a>, “Going Back to East Montgomery”, and the slightly shorter “Like a Sick Eagle Looking at the Sky”-- thrive on such emotional imbalance. They’re both relatively warm and welcoming tunes; in fact, when Baird’s guitar joins Jones’ for the refrain, it’s possible to picture day breaking to the sound of the strings’ bright harmonies. For most of the piece, though, Jones simply winds back and forth through one lithe melody, a reminder that any “sweet shot of joy,” as he calls Baird’s playing in the liner notes, matters most because of the humdrum toil it interrupts. “Sick Eagle” is more dimly lit, but Jones lifts the melody at just the right moments, offering a sudden horizon of hopefulness.    </p>
<p>Perhaps it’s strange to call any instrumentalist a master storyteller, but five albums into his solo career, that’s starting to seem like the most apt summation of Jones’ talents. The liner notes of <i>My Garden State</i> include the tuning systems of each of these songs, as well as technical notes about capo placement and a brief narrative about each tune’s inspiration. Aspiring guitarists might need the alternate tuning suggestions, but listeners won’t really need the anecdotes. Rather, Jones puts it all right there in the pieces, speaking volume about the challenges and triumphs of growing up and older without singing a word of the blues. <i>My Garden State</i> is your <i>Garden State</i>, too, a collection of magnetic ruminations that applies to anyone who’s ever struggled to go back home or leave it in the first place.</p></div>"|18007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18007-glenn-jones-my-garden-state/|7.7|Grayson Currin

Inspired in part by Bret Easton Ellis' <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Less-Than-Zero-Easton-Ellis/dp/0679781498"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Less Than Zero</i></a>, <i>Kids in L.A. </i>follows a group of rich Bel Air teenagers suffering from Los Angeles' mid-winter ennui. ""I've been unbalanced over my time at the pool,"" Kivel sings in one of the album's many ""The O.C.""-worthy moments. Like cloud cover on what moments ago was a sunny day, the honeymoon froth and bounce of Kisses' debut have been subsumed by moody bass lines and the angst of privileged teens. While it's admirable that Kisses turned their puppy dog-eyes outward, their attempt at social commentary ultimately feels half-hearted.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Part of the problem is due to location, or at least their attitude toward it. ""L.A. is so sunny it is often hard to find profound moments in the weather,"" Kivel said <a href=""http://www.dummymag.com/new-music/2010/07/10/kisses-interview-a-strong-will-and-sense-of-hope-/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in an interview</a> a few years ago. On <i>Kids in L.A.</i>, Kisses seem to have internalized this off-the-cuff remark; instead of engaging with the abuse of privilege they claim as an influence in a meaningful way, they avoid it altogether. The biggest concerns of Kisses' protagonists are, in no particular order, sitting around in a bathrobe and drinking coffee and orange juice (""Up All Night""), figuring out how to drive to the record store (""Air Conditioning""), and finding love in a ""Western world"" (""Adjust Glasses""). One of them falls asleep in his father's suit under the kitchen sink. These high school kids aren't just pampered, they're boring. Kivel didn't want to pass judgment on the people he grew up alongside, but compelling character sketches-- the kind that made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_K2eg7Gx8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Super Rich Kids""</a> so spot-on-- require a sense of humor and a judgmental streak, neither of which have ever been Kisses' strong suits.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Kisses are still pretty good at hooks, though, and they're even better with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"">Saint Etienne</a>'s Pete Wiggs and his regular collaborator Tim Larcombe as co-producers. Wiggs applies the brooding energy behind his remix of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHk5NbtNY2Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""People Can Do the Most Amazing Things""</a> to details like the guitar line on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15148-kisses-huddle/"">""Huddle""</a>, which ripples like disturbed water. The luxurious urgency that Larcombe brought to his work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a> is tempered here by crisply gated snares reminiscent of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Lisa_and_Cult_Jam"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lisa Lisa</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Deb"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Debbie Deb</a>, whom Kivel cites as rhythmic touchstones for <i>Kids in L.A. </i>You can hear these two threads in the album's disenchanted funk vibe, but ""Having Friends Over"" is the most effective combination of them. Pumping with dancefloor bends and snaps, the yearning, gloomy atmosphere makes it one of the first songs Kisses have made that warrants repeated listens-- even if it involves a girl, a knife, and the phrase ""grip the tip.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The best song on <i>Kids in L.A.</i> is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14004-funny-heartbeat/"">""Funny Heartbeat""</a>, which happens to fall precisely in the middle (the heart, in case you didn't get it) of the album. It's also the one that sounds most similar to <i>The Heart of the Nightlife</i>, except it's a step above thanks to the heightened production value: Kivel once again revels in his uncanny <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2590-jens-lekman/"">Jens Lekman</a> impression, harmonizing with Edmundson and soaring above the handclaps, hand drums, and shimmering melody. With that one song, Kisses suggest that they can make more than an album's worth of music about their first blush of romance, and that it sounds better than any other thematic concepts they might come up with.</p></div>"|18129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18129-kisses-kids-in-la/|6.0|Harley Brown

So that the Source Family functioned as both a religious sect and an interconnected network of rock groups is not totally surprising; what’s most remarkable about this early-70s hippie enclave was their industriousness. Unlike another Californian “family” of radicals <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">led by an aspiring musician</a>, the Source Family applied their anti-establishment ideologies<b>--</b> as espoused by their 50-something, fearsomely bearded leader Father Yod-- to mostly benevolent ends: They operated a popular, celeb-studded vegetarian restaurant on the Sunset Strip (a precursor to the lucrative health-food industry) and issued their music as a series of small-run, self-produced albums (making them unlikely harbingers of punk’s DIY, handmade ethos), all while avoiding the mass suicide-- if not the skeezy polyamory-- that typically defines such rogue religions.</p>
<p>It’s these records that have rescued the Source Family from a 70s-footnote fate. Since 2006, Drag City has been overseeing an extensive reissue series to complement a label roster that has long served as a safe haven for modern-day psychedelic eccentrics. But the latest part of the campaign could push the Source Family story beyond record-collector realms to mainstream movie-goers in the form of a documentary, <a href=""http://www.thesourcedoc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Source Family</i></a>, that recounts the group’s history through the mostly fond remembrances of its ex-members. And with it comes a soundtrack that should provide a convenient entry point into the Family’s deep discography. But unlike, say, the recent <i>Searching For Sugarman</i> soundtrack, <i>The Source Family</i> has no ambition to serve as a greatest-hits retrospective of an obscure artist. It’s more like a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jOCzuuvmcs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">K-Tel commercial</a> for one, presenting a fleeting series of snippets that provide but a surface-level overview of its subject. </p>
<p>Much like the Source Family’s history, the soundtrack begins innocently enough-- with the acoustic lullaby-cum-recruitment theme “Home”-- before drifting into more chaotic terrain. (Driven out of L.A. after frequent hassles with the cops, the Family relocated to Hawaii, where, in suitably Icarusian fashion, Yod met his demise in a hang-gliding accident in 1975.) A clip of a speech delivered by Yod to a Beverly Hills high school (!) in 1974 espouses the virtues of free improvisation, however the Family’s musical principles were actually quite organized, with Yod centering different group aggregates around specific sounds: Father Yod and the Spirit of 76 specialized in spiritual psych-folk and drone; Children of the Sixth Root Race proffered rousing, gospel-infused pop; YoHoWa 13 explored the outer limits of Hendrixian acid-rock; while Father and the Original Source Family issued recordings of chants inspired by traditional Jewish prayer. Stripped of the sensational backstory, the Source Family’s most accomplished songs can easily hold their own against the popular classic rock of the era: It’s not hard to imagine the sassy soul strut “How Long in Time” flowing out of Carole King’s “I Feel the Earth Move” on your local AM-radio station in 1972, and if some misinformed torrenter were to accidentally mislabel the righteously indignant “Godmen” as an unearthed Jefferson Airplane jam from Woodstock, no one would question it.</p>
<p>But the Family’s more outré excursions are ill-served by the compact format of this soundtrack, whose second half is given over to a random assortment of frustratingly brief excerpts of more substantial recordings. The uncannily Can-like “To the Principles for the Children” and proto-doom-metal lurch of “Penetration” suggest there’s a case to be made for the Source Family as vanguard-pushing visionaries rather than some bygone freakshow curio, but in this abbreviated context these experiments come off as scatterbrained whims. Ultimately, this soundtrack functions best as an invitation for the curious to delve deeper into the Drag City reissues. Rather than deliver an all-consuming religious experience, <i>The Source Family</i> feels more like a brochure handed to you by some robed devotee at the airport. </p></div>"|18052.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18052-the-source-family-the-source-family/|6.6|Stuart Berman

""Don't you want to be <i>right here</i>?""</p>
<p>Devon Welsh sings these lines on <i>Impersonator</i>, his second album with synth programmer Matthew Otto under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz/"" target=""_blank"">Majical Cloudz</a>. And this role-- the Jehovah's Witness ringing your doorbell at 7 a.m. to save your life, the AA member interrupting your lunch hour to explain how his fear of being loved led him to key your Volkswagen last April-- is the role that Welsh plays on <i>Impersonator</i>. In his searingly direct live shows, which have often ended with Welsh standing in the crowd, basking in the communal emotional wellspring he's summoned, and on record, Welsh burns through surrounding obstacles in order make you feel what he is feeling. <i>Impersonator</i> is a gorgeous record-- extraordinarily sung, hypnotically focused-- but it is Welsh's sense of emotional urgency that makes it special. No-one else is likely to pin your ear back in quite the same way this year.</p>
<p>The foundation of the music is synth pop, though Welsh and Otto use it to construct glacially paced, small pieces of music with almost no harmonic motion. Most songs are made of three or fewer elements: ""Childhood's End"" has a four-note keyboard melody, two bare notes of synth string, one droning ""ahhh"" note, and a heartbeat-pulse click track. The air around each element is as palpable-- and as important to the track-- as the elements themselves. On the title track, some voices, looped and babbling, are the only sounds accompanying Welsh, apart from a hushed burst of church organ. There is a natural, inexorable feel to the repetition of these sounds; like clear water quarreling over smooth stones, they're an impersonal constant that situates Welsh's painfully personal performance somewhere larger than himself.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the sound also mirrors the purity and directness of Welsh's language. Here's his idea of an icebreaker: ""Hey man, sooner or later you'll be dead."" ""I wanna feel like somebody's darling,"" he sings on ""Impersonator"". Welsh's are the carefully chosen words of someone whose life depends on getting his point across, and his lyrics often read, on paper, like self-help: ""I feel the mood to love myself and I know I'm trying,"" he says on ""Mister"". But to someone dangling by a thread, self-help clichés take on a terrible significance, and Welsh's voice conveys the desperation of someone who has been tasked with believing in the simplest things again.</p>
<p>Welsh <a href=""http://stereogum.com/1345602/majical-cloudz-frontman-devon-welsh-on-the-weird-joy-of-making-very-personal-music-and-sharing-it-with-the-world/interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has said</a> that, although he gravitated naturally towards the frontman role of whatever band he was in, he was never trained to sing. Listening to his expertly modulated phrasing, his long-breathed lines, and his rich, even tone on <i>Impersonator</i>, it's kind of hard to believe. (For his part, Welsh attributes his natural vocal command to the fact that his father is actor <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0920564/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kenneth Welsh</a>, best known for playing ""Twin Peaks""' Windom Earle.) There is a hint of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a>'s David Gahan in the plummy edges of his voice, but Gahan's camp and hauteur are burned away; Gahan used those tools to establish distance, and Welsh's aim is to close it. He is startlingly flexible, capable of dipping to Calvin Johnson-basso profundo lows, but without Johnson's training-wheels wobbles. He can ascend effortlessly into a bell-clear head-voice that recalls the George Michael of ""One More Try"". His velvety, heated vocal take on ""Turns Turns Turns"", while not a pyrotechnic performance, remains one of the most nakedly beautiful pieces of singing I've heard this year, in any genre.</p>
<p>You can hear the idiosyncrasies of Welsh's self-training poke out of some of the album's odder edges. On ""Childhood's End"", the word ""come,"" sung in an ascending melody, separates out so that it sounds like ""come home."" On the same song, he turns the word ""me"" into three words, each with a different vowel. These quirks work as part of Welsh's larger forceful disarmament strategy: “People that have written reviews of our shows have commented that, ‘Oh, he seemed nervous or he seemed uncomfortable on stage' … I tend to take that as a compliment,"" he <a href=""http://flavorwire.com/391619/meet-your-new-favorite-band-majical-cloudz-on-radical-vulnerability-and-the-mythologizing-of-montreal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. ""I never want to be the kind of performer that seems completely calm and collected on stage; I would rather … [be real] about the idea that when you get on stage it always feels new.” On ""I Do Sing for You"", Welsh reaches out to soothe a member of his own embarrassed audience: ""You would laugh, but I'm on stage for you/ I do sing for you/ Of course I do, and I love to."" There is very little you can do in the face of such an onslaught of loving kindness, so you surrender. <i>Impersonator</i> gently twists your arm like this, song-by-song and note-by-note, and it is as discomfiting as it is transcendent.</p></div>"|18042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18042-majical-cloudz-impersonator/|8.2|Jayson Greene

It was just a couple of college kids who had heard and fallen in love with the single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2899-jason-molina/"">Jason Molina</a> had recorded for Palace Records earlier that year. But both the singer-songwriter and the label hit the ground running: In 1997, they released Songs: Ohia's self-titled debut album as well as its first LP, <i>Hecla &amp; Griper</i>. Molina released at least one-- and very often two or three-- albums every year until 2003, when Songs: Ohia morphed into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2945-magnolia-electric-co/"">Magnolia Electric Co.</a> It was largely on the strength of Molina’s keening and affecting vocals as well as his poignant and probing songwriting that both the band and the label flourished throughout the late 1990s and into the 21st century.</p>
<p>At the time of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/afterword/9087-jason-molina/"" target=""_blank"">his death this past March</a>, Molina and Secretly Canadian were planning to reissue releases from the darker corners of his catalog, and the first to see the light is the <i>Hecla &amp; Griper </i>EP, which appears on vinyl for the first time. Molina, a Ohio native, took a short break from touring to stop off in Bloomington, Indiana, and cut a few tracks with Daniel Burton. The result is a set of songs that are disarmingly raw and unbounded, less polished than even <i>Songs: Ohia </i>from<i> </i>that same year. Burton’s production is spartan to match the arrangements, which feature Molina’s signature tenor guitar and only occasional contributions from a handful of musicians.</p>
<p><i>Hecla &amp; Griper</i> sounds suitably lonely and beleaguered, two moods Molina conveyed with innate conviction. Especially compared to his later work with Magnolia Electric Co., his voice pierces through these songs almost violently, high-pitched as usual but with a sharper nasal quality that suggests an unassuming, untrained performer: a regular guy who simply stepped up to the mic and started speaking his mind. Except there were some dark thoughts in that mind. At times <i>Hecla </i>plays like a statement of purpose, a prologue to his career: “If I decide to smile and fake it, the lord would ne’er forgive that sin,” Molina sings on the opener “Pass”, a slip of a song-- barely a minute long. “I take the words the angels tell me, and I’m singing it from my conscience.”</p>
<p>And yet, there is some humor on here. Molina was hardly one to crack a joke mid-song, but you can get a sense of his casual humor just by reading a few interviews. “I first chose you for my all-star team,” he claims on “Easts Last Heart”, which uses a baseball metaphor to decry the wealth divide: “Rich kid, I’m talking to you!” he concludes, as if you might have missed his target. Molina ends <i>Hecla</i> with a Conway Twitty cover, “Darling…” (popularly known as <a href=""http://youtu.be/4hLrGjh0Mk8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Hello Darling”</a>), and seems to relish the opportunity to sing someone else’s words. Considering that this EP was recorded just after the height of the 90s alt-country movement-- when upstart acts often played the part of rough-and-tumble hayseeds-- Molina doesn’t condescend to the song or its source material, which is not to say he doesn’t have a little fun with it. He speaks the vocal hook with resignation, suggesting the song is only an imaginary conversation-- what he wishes he had the guts to say to his darlin’.</p>
<p>This 15th anniversary edition includes two unreleased tracks, as well as early versions of songs that would show up on <i>Impala </i>in 1998. “Debts” and “Pilot &amp; Friend” show just how deep Molina’s catalog goes; especially the former, with its curious organ lines, could have been the centerpiece of this or another EP, although “Pilot &amp; Friend” sounds too halting, as Molina’s howl turns into a caterwaul that tests the limits of the microphone. The two <i>Impala </i>tracks are the fullest numbers here: “Hearts Newly Arrived” sounds more frayed and jittery here than it does on <i>Impala</i>, as Molina navigates the tempo changes with a frantic energy and galloping guitars. Insistent drums drive “One of Those Uncertain Heads”, which features a more pointed vocal from Molina that hard-sells the songs’ apocalyptic visions.</p>
<p>Overall, there’s a scratchy, isolated feel to <i>Hecla &amp; Griper</i> that’s similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17266-autumn-bird-songs/""><i>Autumn Bird Songs</i></a>, the final release of new material in Molina’s lifetime. Without suggesting too perfect a circle or too tidy a conclusion to his working life, that comparison does reveal a certain aesthetic that carried through his entire 16-year career. Molina believed in the song at its most primal and most austere, understanding that he could get his point across better with minimal adornment. For him, the power of these songs comes through in the spaces between syllables and notes, where Molina can catch a breath and simply let the silence say its peace. <i>Hecla &amp; Griper</i> is a minor release in his sprawling catalog, yet that does not mean it’s insignificant: This is the sound of a man who was only just getting started.<i></i></p></div>"|18143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18143-songs-ohia-hecla-griper-ep/|7.4|Stephen M.

And almost exactly halfway between the two ends of the spectrum sits an MC named <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31352-tree/"" target=""_blank"">Tremaine “Tree” Johnson</a>.</p>
<p>Last year Tree released a mixtape called <i>Sunday School</i>. It was a rough record released in an unmastered, unpolished state, but it managed to establish him as something like the David Banner of the Midwest: a rapper/producer with a carefully considered aesthetic that’s organic and insightful, but who doesn’t consider himself above writing songs aimed at the street, the club, or the bedroom. <i>Sunday School II</i> improves on its predecessor in almost every aspect. The songs are stronger, his performance is more assured, and the production-- with assistance from Chicago hip-hop recording kingpin <a href=""https://twitter.com/soundscapeCHI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael Kolar</a>-- is deeper and denser. He doesn’t feel like an artist sitting between two scenes, skimming off ideas, but one strong enough to stack them atop one another and climb on top.</p>
<p>Tree calls his artistic philosophy “soul trap,” and it’s as honest a name as it is catchy. On a basic musical level, it accurately describes Tree’s preferred blend of soul music elements-- warm, churchy organ lines and vocal samples pitched up, Kanye-as-chipmunk style-- with beats built around the kind of booming 808 kicks and snappy, precisely machined hi-hats that have been a feature of Southern rap mixtapes for years, and which have recently taken hold in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Taking a deeper view, “soul trap” can also describe the emotional and intellectual heart of Tree’s music. A native of the city’s notorious (and now demolished) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabrini%E2%80%93Green"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cabrini-Green</a> projects, his roots are deep in the street-- in his lyrics Chicago gangs like the Black P. Stone Nation are features of the neighborhood just the same way brick high rises are, and he makes multiple references to a brief stint selling crack at age 13. He sees the nihilism that pervades the gangster lifestyle he opted out of, and wants to stay as far away from it as possible. In Tree’s capable hands these two elements, which on the surface seem so contradictory, combine into a raw but subtly layered portrait of life in black Chicago, one that’s miles away from Keef’s in tone but just as bracing and honest.</p>
<p>Tree delivers this portrait with a ragged melodic howl that recalls Chicago bluesmen as frequently as it does other rappers. Despite the sometimes weighty nature of the material he tackles lyrically, he’s a pop artist at heart (on “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15453-tree-the-king/"">King</a>” he gives the chipmunk-soul treatment to a snippet of Elvis’ “Can’t Help Falling in Love With You”), which helps set him apart from many MCs who get tagged as “conscious” and makes <i>Sunday School II</i> a pleasurable repeat listen.</p>
<p>And even when he’s being conscious he’s not a drag about it. On “So Bad” he describes a dream woman who’s independent, intelligent, and self-actualized, but also stacks paper, flashes diamonds, and projects the kind of intensely confident not-giving-a-fuck that’s more common to rappers than the women they write about. The song describes a combination of virtues that also fit Tree’s music: flashy enough to grab your attention and smart enough to know what to do with it, brainy but sensual, and easy to get hooked on.</p></div>"|18133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18133-tree-sunday-school-ii-when-church-lets-out/|7.7|Miles Raymer

The project was originally the idea of Lizzy Plapinger, co-founder of boutique NYC pop label <a href=""http://neongoldrecords.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neon Gold</a>, and it was consummated when she started working with producer Max Hershenow. After putting out a few singles under the guise of anonymity, they made music to fit the Tumblr plan in the form of 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17234-candy-bar-creep-show/"" target=""_blank""><i>Candy Bar Creep Show</i></a> EP. They put out one song a week, alongside “obsessively curated” images and remix stems.</p>
<p>In his review of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a>’s debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17880-charli-xcx-true-romance/"" target=""_blank""><i>True Romance</i></a>, Marc Hogan called for a moratorium on treating internet platforms as musical genres, and rightly so. But even as MS MR break their umbilical connection to Tumblr to release their full-length debut album, they’ve supplemented <i>Secondhand Rapture </i>with what they’re calling <a href=""secondhandcaptures.msmrsounds.com"" target=""_blank"">“Secondhand Captures”</a>-- a different visual treatment for every song available online; made up of videos of eerie, wretched glamor and corruptible, all-American innocence. MS MR’s desire to give their music a visual analog is interesting, but you wonder about their ability to create a record that can be listened to on its own.</p>
<p>“We both get off on wild weather and write our best music when there’s something crazy happening in the air,” MS MR have said; fittingly, much of <i>Secondhand Rapture</i> revolves around deep, thunderous rumblings, celestial twinkling, foggy shrouds, and the sweet clarity of a pastel dawn. There are brooding, rhythmically strong pop songs that fall halfway between the poutiness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"">Lana Del Rey</a> and the hyperactive fizz of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">HAIM</a>. The parts where it deviates from that template, however, are baffling: most notably ""Salty Sweet"", which has an airy, pumping Middle Eastern-sounding riff, and “Head Is Not My Home”, which revolves around what sounds like a programmed banjo sample. They fit awkwardly amidst the rest of the record. </p>
<p>Plapinger has spoken about not feeling confident about her ability as a lyricist, which works for and against them. At her best, as on the wounded trip-hop-leaning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13628-hurricane/"" target=""_blank"">“Hurricane”</a>, she conveys the air of a girl in her mid-to-late teens feeling disillusionment for the first time, mistrustful of herself and others. Songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14246-dark-doo-wop/"" target=""_blank"">“Dark Doo Wop”</a> and “Think of You” make triumphant hooks out of single lines (""Baby, you should stick around” and “I still think of you and all the shit you put me through” respectively, and conversely), the latter in a hi-NRG springy chorus that sticks out like a showgirl in a convent among its plain verses. But elsewhere, as on<span> the rumbling, pastel synth-swathed </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14171-bones/"" target=""_blank"">“Bones”</a>, the words come over as thin and contrived. </p>
<p>The “secondhand” part of the title, the band say, is a reference to how many of our experiences are mediated through the internet rather than direct contact. It’s a concern shared by many of the current class; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> is terrified of Tumblr, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30435-savages/"" target=""_blank"">Savages</a> want to smash through mediating devices to live in a present, burning <i>now</i>. MS MR, however, make no attempt to engage with or bristle against the idea, merely representing it. Just as their early release strategy predated the existence of the music itself, these songs play like the moodboard for an actual album, a pitch for the idea of a pop band, rather than one you’d set up a fuckyeah… Tumblr for. MS MR do have <a href=""http://fuckyeahmsmr.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one</a>, but it hasn’t been updated in 10 months. It’s all well and good having a pristine launch strategy, but it means nothing if you can’t follow it with something that invites genuine engagement.</p></div>"|17776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17776-ms-mr-secondhand-rapture/|6.0|Laura Snapes

As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29942-octo-octa/"" target=""_blank"">Octo Octa</a> he was making crisp, hi-definition dancefloor music when much of the L.A. label’s output felt like an extension of the dubby psychedelia of parent label <a href=""http://www.notnotfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Not Not Fun</a>, or else pursued an overtly retro, lo-fi house <i></i>aesthetic. And in contrast to his peers’ allegiances to the US underground, Bouldry-Morrison’s emergent style seemed to mirror the U.K.’s adoption of house forms-- particularly in its use of bold chord progressions and re-pitched R&amp;B a capellas (see the ""1 Thing""-sampling ""I’m Trying""). But Bouldry-Morrison’s use of these techniques has always been inventive and, above all, distinctive-- the sugary synthetic surface and lambent<i> </i>reverb haze of his tracks is often unmistakable<i>. </i>And as 100% Silk has continued to churn out records of variable quality over the past couple of years, Bouldry-Morrison is one of its few signings who, you sense, may have a future beyond that corner of the underground.</p>
<p><i>Between Two Selves</i> is Bouldry-Morrison’s debut LP, and it represents the next step in a steady refinement of the Octo Octa formula. The arrangements have become a little more measured perhaps, the deployment of a capellas less brazen. Structures undulate smoothly, acting out a series of mini-dramas of tension and release, and the handling of frequencies is pleasingly full-spectrum, displaying a renewed emphasis on thunderous basslines and kickdrums. A recurrent feature of Bouldry-Morrison’s sound is his unusually extreme use of compression, meaning that sonic elements don’t sit alongside one another so much as pump fluidly in and out of focus. It’s an effect that may detract from these tracks’ dancefloor effectiveness-- clarity can be lost in denser moments, and important percussive parts might become temporarily obscured in the fog-- but it also lends them a mirage-like quality that is hugely appealing.</p>
<p>Bouldry-Morrison uses this sound as a vehicle for a newly committed exploration of the limits of his expressive range in a record which, in the producer’s <a href=""http://jacdepartment.com/2013/04/18/featured-artist-interview-octo-octa/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">own words</a>, delves into themes of “happiness, anxiety, queerness, and relationships.” An undercurrent of darkness surfaces at points, one not really heard in previous Octo Octa releases. ""Fear"" is sluggish, warehouse-ready techno of a sort, brooding at the opening and, when its chords take on a serrated edge at midpoint, almost aggressive. ""Come Closer"" is more driving, but its looped central refrain of “I want you,” shrouded in a frost of reverb, takes on a sinister urgency. Meanwhile,<i> </i>at the opposite end of the expressive spectrum, ""His Kiss"" is a joyous, U.K. hardcore-indebted affirmation of desire, all delectable chord-spume and rickety breakbeats.</p>
<p>These moments are all excellent in their way, and it’s gratifying to see Bouldry-Morrison broaden his emotional palette. But, going on the evidence of <i>Between Two Selves</i>, the producer’s strongest mode is a form of dreamlike, sensuous fulfillment. It’s present in languid deep house opener ""Who Will I Become"", with its aqueous synth figures, or the lucid ""Bad Blood"", whose down-pitched R&amp;B vocal manages to evade cliche through the the subtle sweetness of its backing. ""Please Don’t Leave"", meanwhile, is a little more forlorn, but trades in the sort of deluxe melancholy that demands to be wallowed in. These tracks are confections, light on the palette and tremendously moreish, and they’re among Bouldry-Morrison’s finest work.</p>
<p>Granted, there are a few weaker moments too-- particularly ""Work Me"", whose alternation between the robust thud of New York house and a syncopated bass hook feels a little too derivative of the U.K. house new school. And in spite of its variations in tone, <i>Between Two Selves</i> is sonically rather homogenous-- Bouldry-Morrison’s taste for candyfloss synths can can start to grate after 50 minutes. But for the most part it’s clear that the producer’s style has reached new heights of subtlety and richness on this record. Octo Octa has long been one of the stronger cards in the 100% Silk deck; after hearing <i>Between Two Selves</i> it's tempting to declare him the strongest.</p></div>"|18132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18132-octo-octa-between-two-selves/|7.4|Angus Finlayson

And while that steadiness is certainly important, it gives short shrift to how the Brooklyn-via-Cincinnati band’s career fulfills a fantasy. Though their self-titled 2001 debut is all but written out of their history, every National album since has been more ambitious, accomplished, and successful than the one that came before it. They are strivers, and their place in the indie rock world suggests that life can be a series of upward promotions and self-improvement. <span>But hard work is often a cover for repressed frustration,</span> as was clear on 2010’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14203-high-violet/"" target=""_blank"">High Violet</a>, </i>an album whose wrought arrangements and violent lyrics underscored <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/magazine/25national-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">every story</a> about what a tremendous pain in the ass it was to make. The question they ask on <i>Trouble Will Find Me </i>is both relatable and fantastical: When do we get a break from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlGkI_TXUeg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shooting up the ladder</a>?</p>
<p>The National may find it impossible ever to <i>relax</i>, but they have learned to stop struggling on <i>Trouble Will Find Me,</i> their leanest and most aerodynamic record yet. Most descriptors of the National’s musicianship-- the exacting performances, Matt Berninger’s oaken baritone, the allegiances with the equally finicky <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">St. Vincent</a> and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan Stevens</a>-- can double as evidence for self-serving arguments about how they’re “boring.” The only term that’s dogged the National more than that one is “grower,” a slightly backhanded remark implying that enjoying them requires an inordinate investment, or that it’s more cerebral than physical. While the National never lacked confidence or craft, <i>Trouble </i>is an easily accessible and self-assured work, largely because it focuses on the visceral power of Berninger’s vocals and Bryan Devendorf’s inventive drumming. It's a sign of trust that they can convey all of their ornate and rich melancholy without every sad note being underlined by a bassoon.</p>
<p>It’s been eight years since Berninger screamed on record, and now that act appears to have served as some kind of exfoliant. (He also quit smoking in 2011.) His vocals are deeper and richer than ever, as well as more tuneful and elegant. The National's dirty secret is that for all of the Dessner brothers’ orchestral ambitions, these songs are simple things: Instantly memorable melodies and minimal chord progressions become familiar after one listen, and then there’s a pivot, usually undetectable the first time around, that takes the National towards one of their proprietary grand finales. The greatness lies in when the listener connects the two and realizes they're part of the same song.</p>
<p>“Graceless” perfects the kind of fist-pumping victory lap featured on “Abel” or “Bloodbuzz Ohio”, and subsequent spins reveal how expertly the build is structured. Ditto for “Sea of Love”, which incrementally wells up to a cathartic call and response that extends a hand to a slipping friend with both empathy (“tell me how to reach you”) and dark humor (“what did Harvard teach you?”). There are plenty of great little moments as well; the fractious time signatures of “I Should Live In Salt” and “Demons” pushing against Berninger’s burly vocals, a tiny, chromatic guitar figure setting “Humiliation” on a new trajectory, “I Need My Girl” expressing its nervy claustrophobia through frilly filigrees. You never lose sight of <i>Trouble Will Find Me </i>being the result of a meticulous process conducted by professionals, though like surgeons, chefs, or interior decorators, they trust themselves to know when to put the tools down.</p>
<p>That’s mostly true of Berninger’s lyrics as well. <i>Trouble Will Find Me </i>doesn't contain his sharpest writing-- in particular, “Fireproof” and “Slipped” cross over to being a bit pro forma-- but in ditching the obtuse metaphors and playing with and against type, it’s his funniest. “I am secretly in love with everyone I grew up with,” he gravely intones on “Demons”, hinting at the dominant theme of how the self-image and relationships formed during his younger, angsty years figure in to his present reality. He brings the stakes down to a tangible level, where he’s invited to nice dinners, punk parties, and meet-and-greets, only to wind up calling his wife, feeling like his presence there is all somehow a giant mistake. “When I walk into a room, I do not light it up... <i>FUCK</i>,” Berninger stresses in an exasperated tone as a minor chord inversion takes away the mock scare quotes during the final chorus of “Demons”, revealing the deep-set despair at the source of all this self-deprecation.</p>
<p>As usual, he’s not alone on <i>Trouble Will Find Me</i>. Within this elemental music, compulsions towards substances, sex, and depression are likened to swamps, oceans, and agricultural decay-- natural events tentatively contained by human will. The characters are medicated, missing, and incapable of justifying their hangovers, let alone glorifying them. On <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5719-alligator/"" target=""_blank"">Alligator</a>, </i>Berninger’s sociopathic tendencies felt defiant, and some may miss that; during “All The Wine”, he drank from bottomless goblets, claiming “God is on my side.” Conversely, the narrators of <i>Trouble Will Find Me </i>are creatures of habit attending to dull aches; a perfunctory anti-romance is consecrated with “Tylenol and beer”, and by the next song, Berninger mutters, “God loves everybody, don’t remind me.” Where he once fancied himself a cold-blooded heat-seeker and a “birthday candle in a circle of black girls,” the isolation he now feels renders him as unique as “a white girl in a crowd of white girls in a park.”</p>
<p>Considering the National can no longer be compared to anyone besides themselves, it’s fitting <i>Trouble Will Find Me </i>is their most self-referential album. Sometimes, they’re alluding to their image as the definitive yuppie band: Berninger calls himself “a 45 percenter,” “a television version of a person with a broken heart.” They’re also putting their own work up against the canon because they’re big enough to do it: <i>Let It Be</i> and <i>Nevermind</i> serve as paragons of stability on “Don’t Swallow the Cap”, Elliott Smith’s despondent “Needle in the Hay” contrasts with the pokerfaced “Fireproof”. <i>Bona Drag </i>plays during the luxurious piano mope of “Pink Rabbits”, <i>LA Woman </i>and Guns N' Roses are given malaprop name-checks on “Humiliation”.</p>
<p>Of all the references, the most powerful serves as the final line on <i>Trouble Will Find Me</i>: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gproa6vzgws"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“they can all just kiss off into the air.”</a> On a song which bemoans the futility of living in the past, here’s a band often mocked for aging with their music quoting a band often mocked for music that’s stuck in a permanent state of teenhood. It could be the funniest or the most heartbreaking moment on a record full of instances of both, a reminder that when Berninger sings “I was trying not to crack up” on the previous song, there’s two ways of reading it. On a similar topic, Ezra Koenig recently <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mDxcDjg9P4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">opined</a>, “wisdom’s a gift but you’d trade it for youth,” and “Hard to Find” is a similar thought taken from a different angle. People stay down with their demons wishing for that trade to be a realistic possibility, and in the clearest terms his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3NyfvMAh2c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">medium-sized American heart</a> can muster, Berninger expresses his means of finding serenity when trouble tries to find him-- “there's a lot that I've not forgotten/but I let go of other things."" As a culmination and refinement of everything the National have done over the past decade, <i>Trouble Will Find Me </i>couldn’t be granted a more fitting mission statement.</p></div>"|18030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18030-the-national-trouble-will-find-me/|8.4|Ian Cohen

This four-track EP for the same label makes that record feel light-years away. The vocals are gone, the sense of space has all but vanished. If <i>Quarantine</i> resembled a Cronenbergian amalgam of flesh and machine, here Halo goes one step closer to erasing humanity from the frame. Those swooping vocal takes feel absent at first. It's hard not to mourn their removal, and worry about the premature halting of an idea that had long life in it yet. On further plays, though, <i>Behind the Green Door</i> casts a different shadow over <i>Quarantine</i>, just as that album did with her prior work. It makes <i>Quarantine</i> a stronger, bolder piece, gaining a little extra weight due to the sense of isolation, even among Halo's own work, that surrounds it.</p>
<p>The sense of forward momentum merges into the music on <i>Behind the</i> <i>Green Door</i> in a quite literal sense; these aren't exactly club bangers, but the feeling of propulsion is aided by the beats that underpin all four tracks. Those rhythms guide Halo down a purposefully tangled path, picking up elements of house music and minimal techno along the way, but cloaking them in a sense of agitation that's barely kept below surface level. This isn't exactly angry music, but there is a feeling of itchy unease that runs as a theme throughout. ""NOYFB"" is the best embodiment of this, with each new layer feeling slightly out of step with everything that came immediately prior. It's disorienting, which is, it seems, Halo's favorite place to be, allowing her to construct worlds that immediately get pulled down and discarded on the cutting room floor. She never appears fully satisfied in the present moment, always eager to move on somewhere else.</p>
<p>Halo has <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/laurel-halo-talks-turbulence-techno-and-her-moving-new-hyperdub-ep/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">commented</a> on the ""sexual energy"" of these tracks, setting up a fascinating disparity between the title of the EP (taken from a well-known porn film from the 1970s, which was among the first hardcore pictures to gain wide distribution) and the tender pound that thumps through a track like ""Sex Mission"". If there is a sexual energy, it's wide-ranging, bridging from moments of quiet joy and reflection to feelings of loneliness and alienation. But the sense of distance being gained while human aspects recede, at least compared to what came before on <i>Quarantine</i>, adds a further twist. The bass drum beats and bursts of stiff electronics that rise in ""UHFFO"" suggest a darker sensuality, something more akin to the dystopian sci-fi dreams of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075931/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Demon Seed</i></a>, the 70s horror feature in which Julie Christie is impregnated by a supercomputer. The underlying themes of that film-- of technology being abused, breaking down, fudging the lines between what's real and artificial-- serve as a useful parallel to the feel of <i>Behind the Green Door.</i></p>
<p>It's interesting to listen back to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15568-hour-logic-ep/""><i>Hour Logic</i></a>, Halo's 2011 EP for <a href=""http://hipposintanks.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hippos in Tanks</a>, in light of the moves she's made here. In many ways the two releases feel like the flipside of a utopian dream, with the earlier work all brash outward moves, caught up in a moment of cautious optimism. ""Throw"" from this EP is noticeably harder, more pessimistic in outlook, with the warped, house-y piano stabs the perfect dysfunctional hook to signal a sense of restlessness. There's a feeling of moving away from something, not to a space necessarily much darker than some of <i>Quarantine</i>, but certainly one where chaos and decline are taking a stronger hold. The title of the EP makes more sense in that context, if you take the enormous popularity of <i>Behind the Green Door</i> as a sort of ground zero for the subsequent wave of seedy profiteering that the adult film industry would be built upon. This work feels more in tune with decay and exploitation in sexual portrayal, the numbness accrued from a constant barrage of imagery, than anything that’s notionally ""sexy.""</p></div>"|18051.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18051-laurel-halo-behind-the-green-door-ep/|7.2|Nick Neyland

He's the kind of acutely intelligent musician who can’t resist articulating the grand conceits behind his work even if he knows they will irritate people, which they often do. But when drummer Greg Fox departed Liturgy in late 2011, it took the heartbeat out of Hunt-Hendrix's <span>theories</span>. On <i>Survival</i>, he's in a comfort zone of sorts, playing with older friends: Greg Smith and Jeff Bobula once backed Hunt-Hendrix in a screamo band called Birthday Boyz, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26785-kralice/"" target=""_blank"">Krallice</a> guitarist Colin Marston worked with Liturgy on 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13915-renihilation/"" target=""_blank"">Renihilation</a></i>. It's a nice update for Hunt-Hendrix's vision, but it's not quite vivid enough to dispel the nagging reminder that the mighty vessel who delivered “Sun of Light” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12157-generation/"" target=""_blank"">“Generation”</a> has temporarily run aground.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Survival is a much more straightforward and grounded project than Liturgy. Some of the guitar parts and melodies start out foursquare; “Tragedy of the Mind”’s hiccuping pentatonic riff, for instance, stomps somewhere just north of Soundgarden’s “Rhinosaur”. The vocals are chanted low instead of screamed high, but they're as much a textural background element as they were with Liturgy. The band has cited Black Sabbath, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"" target=""_blank"">Smashing Pumpkins</a>, and Creedence Clearwater as influences, and there are some classic rock wisps to pick out-- the Sabbath-thick power chords on the breakdown to “Original Pain”, for one.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But this being a Hunt-Hendrix project, there's always a moment when the threads begin twisting-- a drum fill sprouts an extra beat and the song club-foots into a new time signature, or guitar lines stumble over themselves and then start rewinding in place, like they’re trying to back off of a treadmill. There is very little simple forward motion in Hunt-Hendrix’s music; his compositions tend to steer themselves into corner walls and bump repeatedly against them. It produces a calming, repetitive sort of madness, if you're the sort of person who finds banging their head against a wall soothing. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The lyrics scramble our sense of chronology in similar ways: ""Ending begins all the time,"" goes the repeated chant to ""Tragedy of the Mind"". “Original Pain” takes the word ""pain"" and flogs it until it becomes a mantra. The song titles reinforce the implicit threads of tragedy and freedom linking each of the album’s nine droning, pounding compositions. This is one Ur-Riff, divided up into small, manageable transmissions. </span></p>
<p>Survival's music is a little better-suited to head-banging/fist-pumping than that of Liturgy. “Freedom 1” pairs its titanium-grade riff with a heavy blacksmith forge clink, and “Freedom 3” works up a thrumming, migraine tension with its jittery cymbal work and thrumming hand percussion. But <i>Survival</i> isn’t as interesting or as rich as or any of the other projects the various band members are involved in.

Their sound contains lo-fi's distorted treble, the gruff tumble of rockabilly, the soaring heights of R&amp;B balladry, and the weirdness of mid-60s psychedelia. Their albums have the feel of a freeform AM station whose DJs and programmers get their jollies from being gleefully unpredictable, the kind that wouldn’t think twice about following up a tender oldie like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvP30oCPRPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Oh Louie”</a> with a punkabilly romp called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcixqg3nL_M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Cat Party”</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Songwriters Shannon Shaw and Cody Blanchard frequently switch duties as lead singer, sometimes within the same song, which is testament to both their differences and the clarity of their shared vision. They’re singers whose range and timbre often makes it difficult to tell which of them is singing lead (which is more interesting than it is negative), but they're sharp lyricists with very different writing styles. On <i>Dreams in the Rat House</i>, Shaw’s “Ozma” is a touching eulogy about her dearly departed dog, while Blanchard’s “Heads or Tails” is a fictional narrative about a vagabond with a coin in his pocket that he flips whenever he needs to make a critical life decision.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Dreams in the Rat House</i> combines elements of their debut, <i>I Wanna Go Home</i> (particularly the off-the-cuff hijinks and threadbare fidelity), with the songwriting focus of their great second effort, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15336-sleep-talk/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Sleep Talk</a></i>. Songs like “If I Could Count” and “The Rabbit’s Nose” toy with complex melody and song structure while exhibiting the fine art of making it all look easy. “Rip Van Winkle” takes a generations-old fable and turns it into a monologue from a heart-struck woman waiting for a lover to return to her, and has a glittery lead guitar part and a soaring chorus that combine to far more than the sum of its parts. In the number of years they’ve played together, Shaw and Blanchard have learned how to disassemble the parts and rebuild them in a way that sounds both classic and wild at the same time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But their chief attribute is how fun their songs sound. They can do sinister, ghastly garage-punk like the Mummies (“Bed Rock”) or throw faux-ghoulish noises that suggest parody but never cross that line (“Rat House”) without coming across as a novelty act. Blanchard and Shaw are dedicated enough to songcraft to the extent that it’s evident they’re not just fucking around.</p>
<p>One common misconception about certain corners of garage rock is that there's a lack of serious-mindedness among its proponents. But there’s a broad line between having a good time and making a joke out of something. When Shannon and the Clams pull out a ballad as affecting as “Unlearn”,  it becomes apparent that they’re just as good at tugging heartstrings as cackling after tracking those googly noises in “Rat House”. When they craft a goodbye as poignant in its simplicity as “I Know”, it’s like Shaw and Blanchard know you’re going to realize you’ve underestimated the emotional resonance of their songwriting. And that’s when they know they’ve got you hooked.</p></div>"|18078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18078-shannon-and-the-clams-dreams-in-the-rat-house/|7.1|Martin Douglas

That impression mainly comes from the endless stream of self-released CDs and cassettes he's released under the Secret Circuit moniker, some of which were gathered on the excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17442-tropical-psychedelics/""><i>Tropical Psychedelics</i></a> compilation in 2012. It wasn't always this way; Ruscha played in notable shoegazers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2729-medicine/"">Medicine</a> for a time in the early 1990s, and in the Virgin-signed, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/649-john-cale/"">John Cale</a>-produced psychedelic rock act <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Maids+of+Gravity"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maids of Gravity</a>. Those failed glimpses of the limelight appeared to send him scurrying deep underground, only to surface for air again in recent times.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Tactile Galactics</i> has the air of an album with something riding on it, not just for Ruscha, but also for Tim Sweeney, the WNYU DJ who is putting it out as the first full-length LP on his <a href=""http://www.beatsinspace.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beats in Space</a> label. Both even admitted to feeling nervous about its release in a recent joint <a href=""http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2013/05/b2b-secret-circuit-and-tim-sween"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> about the project. That fear doesn't translate to the music, which flashes past with a similar stylistic blur to the <i>Tropical Psychedelics</i> collection, gleefully pulling a wide range of influences into the mix. Sometimes the tools are different-- there's nothing here that infuses the <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Martin+Denny"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Martin Denny</a> lilt that lit up ""Foggy Twilights"" from <i>Tropical</i>-- but mostly it's airy, relaxed electronic work, rarely raising a sweat, often constructed from trancey vintage synth patterns that circle around one another.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's a graceful and highly intricate record, sometimes taking a baffling amount of twists and turns. The arpeggiated swirl of ""Exalter"" shifts through so many changes it sometimes resembles a fully electronic take on an old <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Gong"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gong</a> record. Ruscha can play it loose or tight whenever either mood takes him, ending the album with the endearingly sloppy keyboard work of ""Milk"" and dropping the tighter mood piece ""Escargot"" earlier in the tracklisting. Earnest vocal tracks occasionally surface-- a new addition to the Secret Circuit sound-- sometimes resembling the clash of earthy and synthetic impulses that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a> like to play around with. That's the place where much of <i>Tactile Galactics</i> lands-- gentle electronic work touched by palpable human emotions, a mix that's often hard to get right, but which seems to come naturally to Ruscha (admittedly after many years of practice).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Those years spent toiling in the studio have also led to a natural cohesion that helps bridge Ruscha's fondness for moving from, say, wild cut-up synth lines that resemble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1040-death-in-vegas/"">Death in Vegas</a>' ""Dirt"" (""Parascopic Rope"") to the New Age stew of pan pipes and bongo fury that partly make up ""Mountains"". In lesser hands, <i>Tactile Galactics</i> would sound disjointed, maybe even rashly uneven. But Ruscha is clearly a big picture thinker with a careful ear for making connections. The deliberate choice to keep everything ticking over at 120 BPM throughout acts as the glue that holds it all together, giving this material a meditative feel that's as easy to lie back and get lost in as it is to dance to. It's understandable why Ruscha is so apprehensive about letting this work out in the open after getting burnt by the industry and then spending so long in the dark. <i>Tactile Galactics</i> shows why he's got no reason to hide anymore.</p></div>"|17952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17952-secret-circuit-tactile-galactics/|7.3|Nick Neyland

Funny band name, funny sound, funny masks, and a funny (and incredibly fun) hit called “Da Funk”, found on their debut album, <i>Homework</i>. They’ve come a long way since, but the playfulness remains, and so does their ability to surprise. Every new step in their career, whether positive (the landmark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2134-discovery/"" target=""_blank""><i>Discovery</i></a>, their life-altering pyramid live shows), negative (the inert <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2137-human-after-all/"" target=""_blank""><i>Human After All</i></a>, their forgettable score for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14938-tron-legacy-ost/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tron</i></a>), or somewhere in between (the film <i>Electroma</i>) has been met initially with a collective sense of puzzlement: “Now what’s this all about?”</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Random Access Memories</i>, the fourth proper studio album from Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, continues the trend. But the differences between their first three albums and this one are vast. <i>RAM</i> finds them leaving behind the highly influential, riff-heavy EDM they originated to luxuriate in the sounds, styles, and production techniques of the 1970s and early 80s. So we get a mix of disco, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast and even a few pinches of their squelching stadium-dance aesthetic. It’s all rendered with an amazing level of detail, with no expense spared. For <i>RAM</i>, Daft Punk recorded in the best studios, they used the best musicians, they added choirs and orchestras when they felt like it, and they almost completely avoided samples, which had been central to most of their biggest songs. Most of all, they wanted to create an <i>album</i>-album, a series of songs that could take the listener on a trip, the way LPs were supposedly experienced in another time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Daft Punk, in other words, have an argument to make: that something special in music has been lost. You can’t have an argument without a thesis, and they start the album with one called “Give Life Back to Music”. The song’s opening rush brings to mind “old” Daft Punk, but then come percussive guitar strums courtesy of Nile Rodgers followed by orchestral surges. From the jump, it’s clear that the particulars of the sound are important. In a strictly technical sense, as far as capturing instruments on tape and mixing them so they are individually identifiable but still serve the arrangements, <i>RAM</i> is one of the best engineered records in many years. If people still went into stereo shops and bought stereos regularly, like they did during the era Daft Punk draw from, this record, with its meticulously recorded analog sound, would be an album to test out a potential system, right up there with Steely Dan’s <i>Aja</i> and Pink Floyd’s <i>Dark Side of the Moon.</i> Daft Punk make clear that one way to “give life back to music” is through the power of high fidelity.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Another way is to work with artists young and old who have inspired them. Rodgers pops up again on “Lose Yourself to Dance” and “Get Lucky”, and on both songs he’s joined by Pharrell on lead vocals. These two songs basically find Daft Punk attempting to make their version of a Chic song, which, in itself, is not a particularly notable goal. But the French duo’s craftsmanship carries the day. Pharrell, despite being the biggest contemporary star on the album, sounds anonymous-- his vocals are pretty much just functional. But even that is arguably in line with Daft Punk’s reverence. Disco, after all, was often a producer’s medium, and lead singers weren’t necessarily meant to be the the focus of attention. So it comes back to songwriting and production: How strong is the groove, how memorable are the hooks? “Get Lucky”, a deserved hit, works on both counts. “Lose Yourself to Dance”, on the other hand, is OK, but plodding, perhaps the weakest song on the record and a good example of the potential pitfalls of Daft Punk’s backward-looking approach.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Other songs in the record’s first half-- “The Game of Love”, “Within”, and “Instant Crush”-- don’t make a huge impression initially but are best understood as part of a broader whole. “Game” and “Within” are downtempo, slightly jazzy robotic soul, delivered in the kind of gorgeous vocoder that Daft Punk have perfected. Musically, “Instant Crush” sounds a lot like a great song by Daft Punk’s pals <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"" target=""_blank"">Phoenix</a>, and the processed lead vocal from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a>’ Julian Casablancas holds a simple tune that’s catchier than anything he or his main band have managed in a while. All three tracks function well in the context of the record, throwing the tour-de-force “Giorgio by Moroder” into sharp relief.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">“Giorgio” is a stunning piece of pop-prog that seems partly drawn from the groundbreaking producer’s experiments in long-form, epic disco, like his side-long version of “Knights in White Satin”. Moroder’s only contribution to the song is an interview that offers a thumbnail history of his life as a musician, one that recounts how how he heard the sequenced Moog as the future of music (see “I Feel Love”). The construction of “Giorgio by Moroder” is masterful, moving from easygoing beats to a for-the-ages, chill-inducing synth line, to orchestral crashes, to a brilliantly goofy guitar solo. It’s a fitting tribute to Moroder’s spirit and legacy.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>RAM</i>’s best songs come in its second half, another clue that it’s meant to be heard in full. It builds as it goes. “Touch”, the record’s literal centerpiece, is where things start to get interesting. It’s telling that the songs featuring the two oldest and deepest influences on the record-- Moroder and Paul Williams-- are the most over-the-top.  (Williams' role in the 1974 cult film <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071994/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Phantom of the Paradise</i></a> became an early obsession for Daft Punk.) These pocket symphonies allows the duo to take their concerns to the furthest reaches of ambition-- and good taste. “Touch” packs in a Cluster-fied spacey intro, some showtune balladry, a 4/4 disco section complete with swing music trills, and a sky-scraping choir, all in service of a basic lyrical idea: love is the answer and you’ve got to hold on. It’s strange, disorienting, and emotionally powerful, with a silliness that doesn’t undercut the deep feelings in the least. It encapsulates what makes Daft Punk such an enduring proposition: their relationship to cool. Their vulnerability comes from embracing cheese while also understanding the humor and playfulness in it, holding all these ideas in mind at once.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This quality is also heard in “Fragments of Time”, featuring lead vocals by legendary house DJ Todd Edwards. The laid-back melody embodies another often disparaged musical moment: 70s singer-songwriter excess that East Coast critics liked to write off as the sound of El Lay-- the Eagles, Jackson Browne, Michael McDonald. Conveying the openness and innocence that marked pop radio as the 70s ended, “Fragments of Time” sounds something like a sequel to <i>Discovery</i>'s “Digital Love”. Contrasting ""Digital Love"" and ""Fragments of Time"" also raises an interesting paradox: though everything about <i>RAM</i>, from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more “human,” the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect. To my ears, this quality isn’t necessarily to its detriment, as much of its appeal ultimately comes from its surface beauty, the sheer gorgeousness of the overall sound. But I suspect this feeling is at the root of why, judging from early reviews, some listeners were underwhelmed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The continual churn of the internet, experience tells us, favors quick connections, conveniences, ephemeral pleasures. But there are areas of culture popping up that seek to slow down, focus on details, and wallow in the kinds of media that it still takes money to create. This is the space that Daft Punk seek to occupy, which in and of itself can be seen as problematic. For those who embrace the more egalitarian approach to music production created by access to cheap tools and cheap distribution, Daft Punk’s mind-bogglingly lush record scans as elitist, possibly even dismissive of the creativity that is happening on a smaller scale.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To really understand where they’re coming from here, you have to go back to the height of the album era, which was really just a blip in pop music history. Three things made it different: 1) it was the time just before MTV; 2) it was the time just before the CD; 3) it was the time just before the Walkman. All three hit around the dawn of the 80s and had a profound influence on how recorded music was experienced. MTV, in addition to foregrounding the visual presentation of artists, returned music to a singles-focused realm. The CD did its part too, making skipping ahead so easy and allowing for the listener to jump around at will. (It also made artwork less important and introduced the idea of records as “data”.) And the Walkman's convenience opened up new spaces for listening while decreasing sound quality, a trade-off that has driven the technology behind popular music consumption ever since.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So <i>RAM</i> is best appreciated as a counter to these trends. It’s not that “all music <i>should</i> be this” but that “some music <i>could</i> be this.” By the time you make it to the album’s astonishing final stretch, it’s hard not to think that Daft Punk have succeeded at what they set out to do. The arrangements on ""Beyond"" and “Motherboard” are breathtaking, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Panda Bear</a>, after many so-so collaborations, aces his vocal turn on “Doin’ It Right”, a terrifically uplifting bit of electro-pop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And then it ends with “Contact”: It’s the most old-school Daft Punk song here, and it’s also the only one based on a sample, pulling its main riff from a 1981 song by the Australian band the Sherbs. Daft Punk and collaborator DJ Falcon first used “Contact” in a DJ mix in 2002, and now it finds its way on an album about time and memory in 2013. You get a feeling of time collapsing with it, seeing where Daft Punk have been and where they could go. “Contact” will likely close some future live multimedia extravaganza, and people will go insane, and they will return to this album with new ears. You never know, but my guess is that people will be listening to <i>Random Access Memories</i> a decade hence, just like we’re still listening to <i>Discovery</i> now. You’ll forget the YouTube interviews with the collaborators, you’ll forget the day they announced the suits, you’ll forget the day the “Get Lucky” snippet leaked, you’ll forget every rumor, you’ll forget the “SNL” commercials. But the record will remain, something that channels the past but sounds like little else right now, an album about rediscovery that's situated in the constantly-shifting present.</p></div>"|18028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/|8.8|Mark Richardson

Even before her debut album <i>Sing to the Moon</i> was released in Britain, she was shortlisted for the prestigious Critics Choice Award at the 2013 BRIT awards. Since the album was released, Mvula’s bright-hued retro-soul has been praised to the heavens for originality while simultaneously being compared to the luminary likes of Nina Simone and David Axelrod. Much of the praise is richly deserved. <i>Sing to the Moon,</i> which was just released here in the States,<i> </i>is a triumph of arrangement and melody: Songs like opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14553-like-the-morning-dew/"" target=""_blank"">“Like the Morning Dew”</a>, or the gorgeous title track, combine earworm hooks with beautiful, uniquely shaped verses, and showcase the open-hearted faith in the world that is clearly Mvula’s calling card. Even when her lyrics communicate melancholy, it seems the singer has no choice but to sound defiantly anti-blue.</p>
<p>The formal complexity of Mvula’s best songs is testament to an education at the esteemed Birmingham Conservatoire, whose graduates often stray towards jazz, opera, and classical composition. You can hear that training in the stately processional entrance of “Make Me Lovely”, which soon blooms into a full-fledged, powerful chorus, or in the prettily drawn piano and alternating tones of “I Don’t Know What the Weather Will Be”. Beyond her studied compositional ear, Mvula’s voice is also a winning draw. There’s a hitch in her dusky alto that recalls a mix of Jill Scott and a demure version of Amy Winehouse. Her voice is classically beautiful but there’s enough oddity-- a sort of gravelly undertone-- in her pronunciation to keep it interesting throughout the album.</p>
<p>A lot of anonymity is built into Mvula’s topics of choice: beauty, love, faith, heartbreak, and hardship are all discussed on the album with the same generalized air. This can be a strength when it comes to pop songwriting-- the stories here are universal enough to be broadly relatable. But Mvula shines when she gets a bit more personal: She shows a snappy attitude on the show tune-like “That’s Alright”, an affirmation of her faith in who she is, which doubles as one of the most exciting tracks here. Mvula sounds best on her more upbeat songs, so it's a shame there are so few of them.</p>
<p>It’s an odd choice, given the success of singles ""Green Garden"" and ""Like the Morning Dew"", to fill the album with so many slow-burning, hopeful anthems. Though they show off Mvula’s vocal talents as well as anything else here, over the full record they can become mundane and somewhat repetitious. “Is There Anybody Out There?” and “Father Father” might work as one-offs for someone encountering Mvula’s voice and compositional abilities for the first time. But they sink in comparison to the songs they follow, leaving the album with almost 10 minutes of under-utilized space.</p>
<p>Mvula's music hearkens back to an earlier era than that of her many British contemporaries: She hovers on the edge of pop, but the majority of her songs are too reserved to fully break through. Mvula's debut is filled with visceral and musical beauty--that is its strong spot. Once she rids her work of thematic repetition and lyrical mundanity, she'll be on to something truly special. </p></div>"|17813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17813-laura-mvula-sing-to-the-moon/|7.4|Jonah Bromwich

It begins uninnocently enough, arming up, then moving to intent, and finally motive: ""Maybe you'll be holding her hand/ Or watching her shitty band,"" she snarls, drawing out ""band"" in a way that displays the full plumage of her disgust. She strums slowly, unfancily, as she recounts a lover's bed-hopping betrayal. Then there's the shot-- ""HA!"" and a grunge-glorious bridge with the big reveal, ""She took your love away from me/ And I am thankful."" She wants him back as much as she wants him gone. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>It's Up to Emma</i>, Scout Niblett's seventh, is her best album since her debut, full of raw power as it follows the aftermath of a toxic relationship through the various <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Kübler</span>-Ross</a> stages, alternately restless and rutting, psychotic and clear, murderous and devoted. Niblett fashions a compelling arc for the kind of character we know colloquially in popular culture as ""the psycho ex-girlfriend."" Niblett inhabits the story, first person: ""I fooled myself for too long."" ""I wish that you could find what you need."" ""I still remain by your side."" ""I don't need to hear her name."" ""What can I do?"" She gives it breadth and depth that expands the character, humanizing the caricature of the done-wrong, bunny-boiling bitch that just can't get over getting dumped.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Not unlike <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2559-lungfish/"" target=""_blank"">Lungfish</a></i>, Niblett has worked her particular brand of blues to a science. Record to record, there's a reliable similarity that is either finessed or stripped back.<i> It's Up to Emma</i> is her first without Steve Albini producing, and is markedly fancier for it; a bit of an about-face from her last two that were so fitful and so raw. Even as harrowing and discomfiting an experience as <i>Emma</i> is, it's the most listenable record Niblett has made since her debut; caustic in a totally different way than usual.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The real work of this album is just how far she lures us into the this character's dark cocoon. She initially presents us with this vicious fantasy of a woman seeking to disrupt her misery by any means necessary, but it's also a fantasy about wresting control. The character is finding power where she can; in this gun, in this dream of offing her two-timer, in being glad he is gone, she gets to have the last word. She's not necessarily the sort of protagonist you'd want to relate to. Maybe not even the sort of character you'd want to hear define the hard edges of her confusion and agony for the better part of an hour. But Niblett does a masterful and most uncanny thing-- she turns us. She splays the guts of the matter, nuancing the petulant need and <i>baby-why'd-you-go</i> as it reconciles into something softer. By the end it's hard not to find resonance with it, even if you've never been a Heathcliff mewling on the moors.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As the album moves us through the aftermath, the mood doesn't particularly let up. Coming on the heels of ""Gun"", ""Can't Fool Me Now"" is about as much air as we get until the nearly seven-minute closer, ""What Can I Do?"" The song is a sort of secondary reckoning, a diagnosis, and is the album's real moment of ceremony: soaring strings and rolling kettle drums give some dynamic to Niblett's familiar guitar interval. There are fits of strings and percussion throughout that force things forward, but <i>Emma</i> mostly stays in the same place, these tense few chords repeating, with a spindly little note run or lead here, a little e-bow there. There's this drag to it, though; the down-tuned rumble of her unadorned guitar tone anchors the feeling that there is no escape, its stasis mirroring the album's relentless obsession.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Emma</i> does offer redemption, though that implies that something has been transformed. Over the course of the record's story, the sense of who our heroine is-- or even that she is someone outside of the context of this man, this pain-- becomes evident. She goes from martyr (""I wish I could take the weight for both of us/ Sure did try to""), calling ""My man... my man..."" to the confusion of ""Second Chance Dreams"" where she confesses ""I'm still getting wet"" at the thought of reuniting with the man that's rejected her. On the penultimate ""Could This Possibly Be?"" she owns up to who she is, tied to this love, setting up ""What Can I Do?"" where both the singer and the listener see the ""truth"" of the situation: She has not been broken by this.</p></div>"|18033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18033-scout-niblett-its-up-to-emma/|7.6|Jessica Hopper

Menche has been working at that frantic pace for the majority of his career, too, issuing several albums, collaborations and contributions with each new calendar. Between 2005 and 2009, he seemed unstoppable, releasing a feverish amount of material that felt ever significant and never tossed-off. During that period, I collected everything he released. Recently, though, Menche’s aesthetic had started to feel a bit tired, at least to me. I’m still not sure if the problem was with Menche or me-- perhaps I’d heard too much too quickly and grown too obsessive, or perhaps he’d actually stalled out. After all, he’d gone deep with visceral bass and high with wrenching noise, fast with industrial wash cycles of percussion and slow with drones that blossomed like orchids. What was left? Last year’s aggressive <i>Guts </i>was good, sure, but it also felt like stylistic mannerism, an irascible body blow from a guy trying to fight his way outside of the cloister of his own construction.</p>
<p>But already in 2013, Menche has released two remarkable records that not only stand alone as magnificent marathon trips but stand<i> apart</i> within his own canon, too. Previously, Menche’s oeuvre might only be described as beautiful from the inside looking in; spend enough time learning his vocabulary and becoming accustomed to the customary din, and the harshness begins to glow. But <i>Marriage of Metals</i>, his first for Editions Mego since <i>Guts</i>, is his most identifiably <i>pretty</i> music to date and one of the best albums of his career.</p>
<p>For recording, Menche entered the studio of <a href=""http://www.vsbgamelan.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Venerable Showers of Beauty</a>, a Gamelan ensemble that “foster artistic exchanges between Java and the Portland community.” He captured the range of available gongs and metallophones and then routed the recordings through his electronics, shaping the sounds into two tracks. Pieces of liminal wonder, the dual protracted pieces test the boundaries between attack and decay, between consonance and dissonance, between motion and stillness, between disasters and dreams. Tiny melodies bubble from beneath cloaks of distortion and disappear, leaving you to wonder if they were ever there at all. Rhythms pepper the space like fireflies in the dark. Everything about these pieces is intentional, but Menche somehow makes it all feel incidental and instinctive, as if you’ve simply stumbled into the sound of another world-- part Gamelan and part electronic, sure, but mostly alien. Menche’s music has long tended to pull listeners away from reality, suspending time and expectations for vast stretches. <i>Marriage of Metals</i>, however, creates its own reality.    </p>
<p><i>Vilké </i>dovetails more with Menche’s past. On a series of four 19 or 20 minute tracks, he uses tumbles of warped digital percussion and swelling-and-subsiding drones to create harrowing environments where something sinister always seems to lurk just ahead. These are gauntlets of abrasion and anxiety. Taking its name from the Lithuanian vocative noun for female wolf, Menche hints at wildlife mimesis within these 80 minutes, the drums occasionally galloping like lupine paws and the distended tones howling like the wind or the animal itself. Still, <i>Vilké</i> feels soft around the edges, as though the animalistic wrath of similarly structured Menche records has now been augmented by a more balanced and honest view of the world around him. <i>Vilké </i>tempers Menche’s usual approach without dulling it.

This project began life under the name Bad Rabbit, assembled by Jarmusch, drummer Carter Logan, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28390-sleigh-bells/"">Sleigh Bells</a> engineer Shane Stoneback. The initial aim was to flesh out the <i>Limits</i> soundtrack with thoughtful, instrumental rock passages. This EP, apparently the first in a series, is an advance on that music. The setting is firmly fixed to ""desert,"" with each of the four tracks touching on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7676-josh-homme/"">Josh Homme</a>'s approach to psychedelic rock.</p>
<p>It's not hard to imagine an alternate universe where Jarmusch pursued music harder than film. At a recent show at the Mercury Lounge in New York, staged to showcase SQÜRL and his work with Van Wissem, he cut an imposing figure on stage. Whether stepping up to the mic or stooping down by his amp to pull out a wail of feedback, it felt like these were the predominant moments Jarmusch played out in his teenage dreams. Of course, he's played on stage many times before, notably with no wave outfit the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Del-Byzanteens"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Del-Byzanteens</a>, but at this stage in his career, where he's comfortably established in a different medium, the show at the Mercury was pleasing for the full-blooded commitment it showed. It's indicative of the way Jarmusch works, finding weight in moments both big and small, never ascribing more importance to one over the other.</p>
<p>That wilfull artistic blindness is fundamental to Jarmusch's stradling of the avant garde and the mainstream. It's what allows him to put <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/521-butthole-surfers/"">Butthole Surfers</a> frontman Gibby Haynes in a <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112817/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">movie</a> with Robert Mitchum and Johnny Depp. Similarly, SQÜRL draws from a number of different disciplines. One track on this EP is simply drawn from layers of feedback. Another matches crunchy, distorted guitar lines to Jarmusch singing about being surrounded by piles of dead hippies. Yes, he's singing here, on two out of four tracks, only one of which deviates into the forlorn rock &amp; roll crooner trap you might expect him to fall into. That track-- a cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22874-elvis-presley/"">Elvis Presley</a>'s ""Little Sister"" forcibly shoved through a meat grinder-- is the weakest work here, the only song that feels like an afterthought, and currently outpaced in the gutter-neon stakes by Jarmusch acolyte <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29375-dirty-beaches/"">Dirty Beaches</a>.</p>
<p>Where SQÜRL works best, perhaps unsurprisingly, is through the planes of repetitive sound that make up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50409-listen-new-track-from-director-jim-jarmuschs-band-with-vampire-weekendsleigh-bells-producer/"">""Pink Dust""</a>. It’s the most soundtrack-y thing here, the closest this EP gets to forming a link to the material this band specifically composed for film under their Bad Rabbit guise. The guitar tone isn’t far from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/620-boris/"">Boris</a>'s ""Farewell""-- itself a part of the <i>Limits of Control</i> soundtrack-- but with a far nastier undercurrent crudely stamped all the way through it. It's a decent approximation of the kind of stuff Jarmusch has clearly been listening to in recent times, judging from his soundtrack work and handpicked ATP lineup. It's part drone-rock, part metal, part blissful stoner fatigue. There's a power to it that the rest of the material can't get back to, a sense of magic unfolding in those gigantic riffs. For now, SQÜRL <a href=""http://www.atpfestival.com/recordings/artist/squrl/bio.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">describe themselves</a> as ""enthusiastically marginal,"" but there's enough going on here to suggest that's a placeholder rather than an epitaph.</p></div>"|18077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18077-squrl-squrl-ep/|6.2|Nick Neyland

The latter saw <i>Gatsby</i> as a tale of aspiration (check the novel's <a href=""http://rapgenius.com/F-scott-fitzgerald-the-great-gatsby-chapter-i-lyrics"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rap Genius entry</a>), and persuaded Luhrmann-- whose 3D production of the film was designed to draw audiences into the wild party scenes-- that a hip-hop-inspired soundtrack was the perfect way to convey the excitement and novelty of the Fitzgerald-coined ""jazz age"" to modern viewers.</p>
<p>But Jay-Z and music supervisor Anton Monsted didn't exactly commit to the theme; Jay's opening track, ""100$ Bill"", and the inclusion of his and <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18035-the-great-gatsby-ost/pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>’s undeniable ""No Church in the Wild"" are the only full-on rap tracks here, with a few other, poppier songs hanging from the genre's coattails. Perhaps it shows Jay-Z’s knack for Gatsby-like social one-upmanship, allowing everyone to participate in his vision while remaining very much at the center of it, reveling in his influence. Either way, ""100$ Bill” sets the thematic tone: “Benjamin Franklins filled, folded just for the thrill/ Go numb until I can’t feel, or might pop this pill,” Jay raps in cavalier fashion over a woozy, stuttering beat. The ecstasy side of the party platter remains resolutely untouched throughout the rest of the soundtrack, which grinds ahead with numbed, blithe bombast.</p>
<p>It half-works on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6335-andre-3000/"" target=""_blank"">Andre 3000</a>’s cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5185-amy-winehouse/"" target=""_blank"">Amy Winehouse</a>’s “Back to Black”, which isn’t a song you could imbue with much more tragedy. Over a lightly EDM slurp-- the circular swoop of a helicopter hovering low-- there's a slow, screwed feel to the production and their vocal turns. Further along, love is by turns ""blind"" on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"" target=""_blank"">Jack White</a>’s excruciatingly overwrought cover of U2's ""Love is Blindness"", maddening on Emeli Sandé and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1479-bryan-ferry/"" target=""_blank"">Bryan Ferry</a> Orchestra’s dull-but-tasteful, jazz-lite cover of “Crazy in Love”, a sickness on <a href=""http://will.i.am/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Will.I.Am</a>’s torturous EDM jazz-hands scat, “Bang Bang”, and narcotic on Ferry’s reinterpretation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"" target=""_blank"">Roxy Music</a>’s “Love Is the Drug”. It’s telling of how ill conceived this defiantly modernity-inclined collection is that a 67-year-old crooning a nearly 40-year-old song is the sexiest thing here, the high point of a perfunctory, blockbuster bacchanal that displays a stunning lack of imagination among what's meant to be the cream of pop's crop.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Fergie, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"" target=""_blank"">Q-Tip</a> and GoonRock’s “A Little Party Never Killed Nobody (All We Got)” is an inane, cartoonish take on EDM’s scrunch, twist, and punch; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28590-quadron/"" target=""_blank"">Quadron</a> singer Coco O’s “Where the Wind Blows” is light, Paloma Faith-indebted fare; Nero do Nero, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"">Lana Del Rey</a>’s “Young and Beautiful” is exactly what you’d expect a Lana Del Rey song called “Young and Beautiful” to sound like, down to the <i>yep,</i><i>she actually went there</i> line, “Oh that face, makes me wanna party.” The supposedly artsy singer who really demonstrates a dizzying lack of vision is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Florence Welch</a>, whose “Over the Love” is first a small, trembling piano ballad before she puts her dreadful, blaring yell to work shouting a reference to the book's most obvious symbol, “I can see the green light/ I can see it in your eyes.” </p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">The xx</a> and Gotye bring the only touches of anything approaching humanity to the soundtrack; the former on the slightly tedious attempt at high-stakes emoting “Together”, the latter on his intricate 2007 single “Heart’s a Mess”, where he almost rivals Bryan Ferry for a genuinely impassioned vocal turn (even if he gets there by sounding like Sting). Neither Fitzgerald nor Luhrmann’s <i>Gatsby</i> is about subtlety, that's for sure; vulgarity is key, which this soundtrack has in abundance. But regardless of how trite the songs are, they also fail to provide anything akin to an enjoyable or immersive experience-- the combined effect is bludgeoning and fragmented. “This album is amazing. It’s not going to be for the club you know? It’s for driving with the windows down. I suggest you buy a car for the soundtrack, or a bike-- something that moves,” <a href=""http://thegreatgatsby.warnerbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Gatsby_Production_Notes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z said</a>. Most of the cars in <i>The Great Gatsby</i> crash and so does Luhrman's soundtrack.</p></div>"|18035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18035-the-great-gatsby-ost/|4.0|Laura Snapes

<p>In the 1980s and 90s, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2422-mark-lanegan/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Lanegan</a> never seemed like he was going to be an old man. In the 21st century, however, it’s become nearly impossible to remember that Lanegan was ever young. In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16253-blues-funeral/"">his review </a>of Lanegan’s characteristically growly 2012 solo record <i>Blues Funeral, </i>Ian Cohen likened Lanegan to weathered classic-rockers like Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, and Leonard Cohen, and speculated that he “will be all but grandfathered into that Hall of Fame in 20 years.” But why wait another two decades when Lanegan already affects a spooky “chain-smoking walking corpse” persona as well as anybody? The first time Lanegan emerges on <i>Black Pudding, </i>his new collaboration with English multi-instrumentalist Duke Garwood (who most recently guested at the end of Savages' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17977-savages-silence-yourself/"" target=""_blank"">Silence Yourself</a></i>), he’s addressing his frequent sparring partner Jesus C. in the bluesy prayer “Pentacostal”. On the next track, “War Memorial”, Lanegan points to “a pack of feral dogs” nipping at his heels, as he’s not one to choose sides between God and the Devil. “Don’t tell me the ending of the play/ Don’t make me look/ In the mirror,” he sings. We all know which undead creature generally avoids mirrors.</p>
<p><i>Blues Funeral </i>was Lanegan’s first solo record in eight years; for <i>Black Pudding, </i>he’s back to working with a musical co-pilot, which has been his preferred mode of working for the past decade. Like his partnerships with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27770-isobel-campbell-mark-lanegan/"" target=""_blank"">Isobel Campbell</a> and Greg Dulli, Lanegan’s coupling with Garwood is somewhat vampiric in nature. While Garwood makes his presence felt throughout <i>Black Pudding, </i>most notably on the evocative bookending instrumentals “Black Pudding” and “Manchester Special” (which sound like a film score for an imaginary post-apocalyptic spaghetti western), he’s ultimately subsumed by Lanegan’s outsized personality. To his credit, Garwood seems to understand that this was probably inevitable and acts accordingly: His accompaniment on <i>Black Pudding </i>tends to be spare and unobtrusive, which keeps the spotlight on Lanegan, that monstrous croon, and his ongoing communion with the great beyond.</p>
<p>While <i>Black Pudding </i>is more limited and monochromatic than Lanegan’s other pairings-- the beauty-and-the-beast lustiness of the Isobel Campbell records is obviously missing, as is the mile-deep veneer of filth and depravity from the Dulli-assisted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5667-the-gutter-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Gutter Twins</a> records-- it doesn’t necessarily suffer from it. Lanegan is a brand name that promises scarifying dirges and tough-guy sensitivity, and <i>Black Pudding </i>delivers on both accounts with workmanlike consistency. You can guess precisely what songs like “Death Rides a White Horse” or “Sphinx” sound like before playing them. If that makes <i>Black Pudding </i>a wheelhouse record, so be it; the Sly Stone-like downer funk of “Cold Molly” demonstrates that Lanegan falters whenever he ventures outside of his self-made pine box.</p>
<p>Predictability isn’t the most exciting or virtuous artistic attribute, but at least <i>Black Pudding </i>is a luminous and finely crafted example of a well-established formula.

The band has also gained what may feel like a claustrophobic reputation. The swift militaristic efficiency of their musical maneuvers, the transgressive influence of dead French surrealists, and the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/feb/22/iceage-rightwing-accusations"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">heavily reported flirtations with nationalist and fascist imagery</a> have added up to a distinctly aggressive image, even though the members look more like One Direction-gone-to-seed than bellicose reactionaries. That’s what makes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30406-var/"">Vår</a>, the new band of Iceage's Elias Bender Rønnenfelt, sound like a refutation rather than a mere tangent-- or at least, a balancing of scales.</p>
<p>Vår is something of an unusual supergroup within the boundaries of Copenhagen's thriving D.I.Y. hardcore scene. Joining Rønnenfelt are Loke Rahbek of Sexdrome and Kristian Emdal of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30458-lower/"">Lower</a>, along with Lukas Højland. Their similarities to Iceage end with the purported influence of <a href=""http://supervert.com/elibrary/georges_bataille/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Georges Bataille</a>-- which might account for the absurdist poetry moaning over the doomy electronic pulses of their song ""Hair Like Feathers""-- and the use of rolling field snares, suggesting the forced marches of valiantly defeated armies. But Rønnenfelt's downcast voice and mournful, dystopian lyrics are laid bare by the krautrock, industrial, goth- and synth-pop styles that replace guitar thrash on <i>No One Dances Quite Like My Brothers</i>. Though crusted with rough textures, the music is as open and vulnerable as the Copenhagen punk bands are clenched and impervious, bending the same apocalyptic impulse in a serene, interior, even sensuous direction.</p>
<p>For being recorded in a cramped home studio in Bushwick last summer, Vår's Sacred Bones debut feels surprisingly spacious and cool, roaming a wide swath between the softest borders of Joy Division, Kraftwerk, and the Foley-effected, electro-acoustic war folk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5694-these-new-puritans/"">These New Puritans</a>. Throughout the album, samples of broken glass and metal, acoustic and electric guitars, analog electronics, bleary trumpets, and processed percussion line up in soft curves with scoured edges. Bright Eyes may have beat Vår to the mirrored album cover by 13 years, but Vår's choice of artwork makes a sound contextual point: This is reflective music, making the listener complicit.  </p>
<p>At their poppiest, as on ""The World Fell"" and ""Pictures of Today/Victorial"", Vår set raggedly reaching multi-tracked vocals (apparently canned in Germany in the 1970s) over thumping beats and chiming guitars that think they're synthesizers. The velvety, sparkling miasma of the latter represents this collaboration at its most realized, the low heat gradually igniting the snarled images of iron and fire at the end. Not everything is that considered: ""Motionless Duties"" breaks the dreamy mood with its darkness and abrasion, though woozy trumpet peals eventually open it up a bit, and the drums-and-drones piece ""Boy"" is a long interstitial at four minutes.</p>
<p>But ventures outside of Teutonic synth-pop pay off in the title track, where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31210-pharmakon/"">Pharmakon</a>'s Margaret Chardiet gives a remarkably tender recitation atop a pillow of distorted symphonic ambiance. A stirring piece of music in its own right, it also feels like another deliberate attempt, following the video for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46408-iceage-offshoot-war-changes-name-to-var-shares-new-video-for-in-your-arms-final-fantasy/"">“In Your Arms (Final Fantasy)”</a>, by the punks of Vår to soften a brittle public perception of themselves as right-wing hawks. Although the sensitive side it reveals is less developed than their established one, it's just as intriguing.</p></div>"|18019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18019-var-no-one-dances-quite-like-my-brothers/|7.4|Brian Howe

That’s the question that hovers above <i>The Last Spire</i>, the excellent eight-track LP that will mark the end of the long-running, ever-restless English quartet. Early last year, Cathedral played their final show in Australia before returning to England to chart their own demise. For the last two decades, the band has pushed far beyond the slow-growing and wide-set roots of its foundational debut, 1991’s <i>Forest of Equilibrium</i>, to incorporate thrash blitzes, psychedelic tangents and 70s rock bombast. <a href=""http://www.terrorizer.com/2013/03/21/cathedral-discography-lee-dorrian/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Talking through each entry</a> in the band’s catalogue with <i>Terrorizer</i> earlier this year, frontman Lee Dorian acknowledged the deliberate nature of his band’s non-linear development. Sometimes they wanted to retreat from doom, and sometimes they wanted to retreat into it. “I hate complacency,” he said. “It’s not something you should ever feel, especially in terms of art.”</p>
<p>That perspective has kept Cathedral <i>interesting</i> for the long haul, even if it hasn’t resulted in necessarily great records. For instance, the band’s most recent LP, 2010’s <i>The Guessing Game</i>, spent 85 minutes dipping and diving into prog rock aberrations that sometimes felt excessive and often unnecessary. Cathedral kept twisting free from its traditionally lugubrious mid-tempo maul with an assortment of influences, from Uriah Heep to Genesis. Mostly, it made you wish Cathedral would just settle back in to doom again.</p>
<p>And for a moment at the close of <i>The Last Spire</i>, it seems that Cathedral will indeed exit with a sentimental reminder than that they’ve generally been more than a simply gloomy squadron. “This Body, Thy Tomb”, the final song, opens with a low-strung, generously distorted riff, which Dorian pairs with appropriately funereal imagery: “I exist in this coffin,” he opens from a backlit pulpit. “Murdered trust and misfortune has evolved into strife.” Just past the three-minute mark, though, Dorian and the strangling tone of Garry Jennings go quiet, fading into a series of somber instrumentals-- a twinkling acoustic guitar, a glass-eyed electric solo, a music box melody played on mellotron. Cathedral, it seems, will fade into their own apoptosis.</p>
<p>But the mighty band enters one last time, pounding at Jennings’ lead harder than it has for the entire record. Brian Dixon locks into distended drum rolls and swings hard coming out of them, while keyboardist David Moore and bassist Scott Carlson build steep walls around the riff, conjuring claustrophobia even while heading for the exit. No treacle here: Cathedral ends exactly as it started-- heads down in heavy doom. Swansong attachment aside, that return-to-basics approach is one defining characteristic of <i>The Last Spire</i>, an album that reconnects with Cathedral’s beginnings without simply repeating them.</p>
<p>Another is restraint: In an <a href=""http://www.ghostcultmag.com/in-memoriam-an-interview-with-cathedral-2/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with <i>Ghost Cult Magazine </i>published the week after <i>The Last Spire </i>was released, Jennings admitted that the band left a lot of recorded material on the cutting room floor for this album. Of those five omitted tracks, he said, at least one of them was a 30-minute Cathedral farewell that was never finished. At 56 minutes, however, <i>The Last Spire</i> is very much the right length for a band whose most consistent handicap has been not knowing when to say when, or how to move toward the next track or album. No, efficiency has never been Cathedral’s bailiwick, but on <i>The Last Spire</i>, they operate with surprising and newfound economy. They surround lengthy tracks with much shorter ones and generally just get out of their own way. The first half of the record, for instance, moves as swiftly as anything Cathedral has ever done. A terrifying introduction of swelling field recordings, tolling church bells and grating noise passes quickly into “Pallbearer”, a 12-minute anthem that pauses just enough for an acoustic interlude before sprinting headlong into a burst of thrash. It’s an extended number, but Cathedral anchors shifting momentum to a grim mantra00 “War, famine, drought, disease!”-- and a center of doom gravity. You almost want it to keep going, a rare quality for this band. “Cathedral of the Damned”, meanwhile, crisscrosses samples between verses, choruses and solos, while “Tower of Silence” adds a dose of punk ire to its unfettered seven-minute march. By not pausing to take stock of its progress, Cathedral testifies to its true purpose and power.</p>
<p><i>The Last Spire</i> is so close to the spirit of Cathedral’s earliest works that Dorian has said it’s the record he’s hoped to make since their debut, <i>Forest of Equilibrium</i>. Importantly, though, it does not feel like a microwaved visitation with the past or some self-obsessed tribute. Rather, these pieces sound like the work of a band hoping to fortify their legacy at the end of their career rather than simply prolong it. The last two decades of exploration reappear here, certainly-- listen for the sidewinding second guitar in the distance during “Tower of Silence”, or, more obviously, the playful and possibly avoidable keyboard-and-bass fantasy that sits at the center of the otherwise morose “An Observation”. But these are simply the positive after-effects of years of auditory experimentation, not the driving force for the record itself. They’ve got too much to fit into an hour for self-involved excess.</p>
<p>If <i>The Last Spire</i> is the end of Cathedral, it’s a lofty exit for a band that’s often tripped over its own artistic ambition and unease. These eight tracks serve as a swift, sinister reminder of why Cathedral mattered at the start and why they intrigued for so many years in the middle. When it mattered the most, they had the sense to recognize that their work was done and to experience the end with dignity-- and, thankfully, doom.      </p></div>"|18020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18020-cathedral-the-last-spire/|7.5|Grayson Currin

From 2004 Ellis’ Subloaded clubnights were the first to bring the great and good of London’s nascent scene to the city. Tectonic, launched the following year, served as a home for productions from some of dubstep’s future stars, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14235-skream/"" target=""_blank"">Skream</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22116-loefah/"" target=""_blank"">Loefah</a>. By 2007<i> </i>the label was at the forefront of Bristol’s own spin on the genre, splicing its<i> </i>140 bpm rhythmic framework with the metallic sonics and hypnotic arrangements of Berlin techno.</p>
<p>But as the noughties wore on and UK dance music began its migration to slower, house- and techno-friendly tempos, Ellis dragged his heels. He would cling to dubstep for far longer than the majority of his contemporaries, and when he finally (partially) let go it was, it seems, with a heavy heart. (He released a 2011 mix titled <i><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/melissa/ohno-not-another-dubstep-dj-30"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oh No Not Another DJ Playing House Music</a>.</i>) Ellis’ A&amp;R-ing followed a similar contour. In recent years Tectonic’s output has constituted a slightly awkward mixture of backwards-looking dubstep and house- and techno-oriented signings. And while it has remained admirably independent-minded in style (who else in the UK would have taken a gamble on the abstract beat-sketches of Pursuit Grooves?) it feels like Ellis’ previously strong aesthetic vision has frayed a little, and at this point the label’s influence is at something of a low ebb.</p>
<p>The <i>Tectonic Plates</i> compilations have long functioned as a sort of state-of-the-nation for the label, and last year’s <i>Vol. 3 </i>seemed firmly entrenched in dubstep. By contrast, while <i>Vol. 4</i> has by no means abandoned that approach, it feels far less wedded to the past. That’s partly down to the recent renaissance in dark, grime- and dubstep-derived forms clustered around Blackdown’s Keysound label: Two proponents of that scene are featured here. Beneath, whose music typically transplants 2005 dubstep’s baleful sonics onto a UK funky framework, contributes ""Flight""-- an oddity in his discography, bumping along at a sluggish 116 bpm, but compelling nonetheless. Mumdance and Logos, meanwhile, play fast and loose with the sonic hallmarks of grime in ""Drum Boss"", distributing a heavily reverbed percussive palette across cold, weightless space.</p>
<p>There are welcome injections of fresh blood elsewhere, too. ""Talk"", by recent Tectonic signing DECiBEL, is an unexpected highlight-- essentially quickstepping dubstep, all throbbing sub and flickering hi-end, but leavened by brash sampled chords and vocals. And U.S. producers Sinistarr and Texel turn in an intriguing (if confusingly titled) triplet-swung techno number in ""Decibell"". Elsewhere, a few label stalwarts offer pleasant surprises. Jakes’ ""Rounds"" is a welcome detour from his usual high-octane, low-IQ fare, avoiding blindingly obvious drop-structures in favour of an unusual multi-tiered structure. Guido-- always the more imaginative of Bristol’s so-called “Purple” crew-- explores pleasingly off-kilter digital soul in ""State Of Joy"", while Pursuit Grooves’ ""Hard Beginnings"", with its rumbling sub and discordant sample work, is a characteristically bizarre offering.</p>
<p>Granted, there are moments here that feel a little stale, or just plain ineffectual. The syncopations that animate Kryptic Minds’ ""Convoluted"" are smart but, as with much of his work, their execution is so varnished as to pass by without incident. Armour-- an alias of Roly Porter, one half of fabled industrial-dubstep duo Vex’d-- doesn’t shine on ""Skylark"", whose stuttering bass and muted mentasm stabs aren’t nearly as punishing as they ought to be. And it’s difficult to see why the also-ran halftime of Steve Digital’s ""Larry Shite"" merited inclusion. But taken as a whole, <i>Tectonic Plates Volume 4 </i>is a considerable improvement on its predecessor, cleaving closely to the aesthetic co-ordinates of Tectonic’s past without reading like a misty-eyed love letter to a lost time. It also suggests a number of new directions for Ellis to pursue. 2013 may yet be a good year for the label.</p></div>"|18128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18128-tectonic-plates-vol-4/|7.0|Angus Finlayson

Smith was already a cranky old man when he started <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"" target=""_blank"">the Fall</a> at the age of 19; now that he’s 56, he’s eager to act like a child. The first words we hear Mark E. Smith utter on <i>Re-Mit</i> are: “Geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh-geh/ Gus-gus/ Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-blah-blah-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la”-- and in the weird and frightening world of the Fall, this is what happiness sounds like. Because 36 years after forming the band, Smith seems to have finally found a group of people he genuinely enjoys playing with: Not only has his current keyboardist and wife, Eleni Poulou, now been at his side for twice as long (11 years) as his most famous musical/matrimonial partner, Brix Smith, the line-up that appears on <i>Re-Mit</i> is the same one that featured on the Fall’s preceding three albums. By the standards of a band whose list of former members warrants its own <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Fall_members"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia page</a>, bassist Dave Spurr, guitarist Pete Greenway, and drummer Keiron Melling have been playing in the Fall long enough to be eligible for commemorative gold watches. But there are no such prizes to be handed out in the Fall. The reward for such dedicated service is: You get to make another Fall album.</p>
<p>Not that stability breeds consistency, mind you. This version of the Fall has produced their best album of the past decade (2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14202-your-future-our-clutter/"" target=""_blank""><i>Your Future Our Clutter</i></a>) and the worst (2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16081-the-fall-ersatz-gb/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ersatz G.B.</i></a>). <i>Re-Mit</i> fortunately leans more toward the former, proffering a dense, unwieldy tangle of rockabilly rhythms, 60s proto-punk petulance, krautrock thrust, <i>musique-concrete</i> spoken-word splatter, and sci-fi synth-tones salvaged from 70s bargain-bin prog. It’s messy and menacing in equal measure, a bar fight that ends in broken glass and slippery floors, but not before landing a few killer strikes. (In particular, the soccer-riot melee of “Sir William Wray”, the morse-code motorik drive of “Victrola Time”, and the wobbly-kneed boogie of “Loadstones” are the ones you’ll be dragging onto your ongoing post-millennial Fall playlist.) And if Smith now sings like a man who’s had all his teeth knocked out, at least he’s still smiling-- whether emitting Beefheartian grunts on “Kinder of Spine”, squealing like a frightened granny on “Victrola Time”, or punctuating the predatory groove of “Hittite Man” with 20 seconds of phlegm-gurgling coughs, he seems to be reveling in the opportunity to showcase the least flattering extremes of his wizened voice, and present a more grotesque caricature of Mark E. Smith than his haters could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>For all its seeming disarray, <i>Re-Mit</i> makes does make some concessions to structure, opening with an instrumental garage-rockin' rave-up (“No Respects”) that’s later reprised in expanded, vocal form, while positioning its fragmented, formless rambles (“Noise”, “Pre-MDMA Years”) as brief interstitials between the more realized tracks. (That said, “Jam Song” is every bit the meandering slog its title suggests.) And as he is wont to do, Smith offsets his cryptic spiels on Anatolian subcultures, vacationing Italian nationals, and 19th century British politicians with contemporary pop-cultural concerns: in lieu of <i>Ersatz GB</i>’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLQvrck2RsU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Gossip Girl</i> episode recaps</a>, we have a shout-out to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a> leader/unofficial Fall fanclub president James Murphy on the roly-poly rumble of “Irish” (“James Murphy is their chief/ They show their bollocks when they eat”), which, given Smith’s notorious refusal to equate imitation with flattery, is probably not meant as a compliment. However, compared to the vitriol he once spewed upon progeny like <a href=""http://www.pipeline.com/~biv/FallNet/articles/wire_interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a> and <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2011/11/14/111114crmu_music_frerejones"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>, Murphy gets off relatively easy. If you need more proof that Mark E. Smith is in a good mood these days, there you have it.</p></div>"|18044.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18044-the-fall-re-mit/|6.8|Stuart Berman

Not just any scream, but one that sounds like it's shredding all the muscle tissue in the vocal cords of Margaret Chardiet, the 22-year-old New Yorker who records as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31210-pharmakon/"">Pharmakon</a>. It's more a warning than an introduction, a line drawn in the sand that forces you to either cross and face the consequences or turn away and go about your pleasant day. Chardiet outlined her backstory in a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9091-pharmakon/"">Rising</a> feature; the daughter of punk parents, highly active on the DIY scene in New York, uninterested in cultivating any kind of online presence. She says <i>Abandon</i> is about ""fiercely holding on to what's true and unapologetically abandoning what's not."" Getting to the heart of Chardiet's truth is an ugly process, full of pain and suffering and confrontation spilling outward, forming an unwavering commitment to her art that's both commendable and distressing at the same time.</p>
<p>This release for <a href=""http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sacred Bones</a> is the most high-profile Pharmakon output to date, following a series of hard-to-find CD-Rs and cassettes. The music hovers around the noise and power electronics genres, taking cues from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a>, various phases of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4765-whitehouse/"">Whitehouse</a> among others. Like those bands, Chardiet isn't interested in music as a passive listening experience. Instead, <i>Abandon</i> is a brick hurtling through the windshield of a moving car, a purposefully antagonistic act that forces you to fully focus on the moment. Pharmakon's most frightening moments rarely involve a complete noise blackout. This is a carefully worked set of lethargically paced songs, sometimes passing from a chilly machine hum to dull thuds of metallic percussion (""Ache""), sometimes taking pitch-shifted vocal passages and layering them over drones that sound like bombs tumbling out of the sky (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15210-pharmakon-crawling-on-bruised-knees/"">""Crawling on Bruised Knees""</a>).</p>
<p>There’s a thread of body horror loosely strung through Chardiet's work. A prior release included a track named ""Mound of Flesh, Cavern of Fluids""; this record depicts Chardiet covered in maggots on the cover and includes ""Crawling on Bruised Knees""; one of her older tracks, ""Xia Xinfeng"", is named after a woman who literally kissed her lover to death by passing him a capsule of rat poison when their lips met. Similarly, the music carries a strong sense of disease and decay, of things nearing a point of total breakdown. The fascination with bodily atrophy makes sense here, anchored to work so physically draining for both listener and performer. <i>Abandon</i> isn't at all about creating distance or putting up boundaries. Chardiet often forces audience members to look her directly in the eyes during live shows, sucking participants down into her despair in an unnervingly direct manner.</p>
<p>The arc <i>Abandon</i> takes feels deliberately mapped out, heading from an overpowering form of aggression at the start and gradually sinking into more studied material later on. ""Pitted"" borrows some of the clarity Swans found circa <i>Children of God</i>, where noise started to feel like a dead end and tracks like ""New Mind"" represented a solemn trudge out of the mire. Chardiet's vocal bears a similar authoritarian tone to the one Michael Gira possesses; when she sings, you shut up and listen. It's helped by the fact that her multi-octave voice can rise and plummet so effectively, something driven home by ""Pitted"", where no amount of harsh electronics can compete with the full-tilt power of her vocal. It's the one slip of the mask here, the one moment where a form of deathlike beauty is stirred into the swill, momentarily hinting at a place somewhere outside of Pharmakon's defiant battle mode.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href=""http://www.thewire.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a> interview with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/"">Wolf Eyes</a>, the band's John Olson discussed the gradual cessation of musicians working in all-out noise, resulting in more meditative electronic artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"">Emeralds</a>. Olson likened the move to a shift from external to internal impulses, a retreat from the outright purge of Wolf Eyes into something more inward-looking. Chardiet's work as Pharmakon spills all its guts out onto the floor and leaves them hanging for close inspection, but this isn't entirely a return to external outpouring. As noted in the aforementioned interview, there are times in the Pharmakon live show where she's ""disappearing into her own head."" Those moments are apparent here, too, making it feel like Chardiet oscillates between being lost to the world and thoroughly bruised by it. Getting forcibly pinned down in her personal cycle of attack and retreat is a dark, visceral, utterly compelling thrill.</p></div>"|18009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18009-pharmakon-abandon/|8.0|Nick Neyland

With very few exceptions, the best kind of pop music is superhumanly suave and wilts at the first sign of even quasi-academic jargon, so there are a couple of red flags in that sentence: “regular”, “nerds”, “<i>reclaiming.</i>” But luckily, none of these words have anything to do with the way Dungeonesse’s light, infectious, effortlessly cool debut actually sounds. <i>Dungeonesse</i> has none of the awkwardness you might expect from an artist like Wasner (who’s stepping more out of her comfort zone here than Ehrens is) making a self-conscious foray into a totally different genre; surprisingly, she sounds completely at home in the album’s crush-struck vibrancy and retro-90s shimmer. You’d be hard pressed to find the slightest trace of that self-proclaimed nerdiness-- except for the fact that one of the best songs is called “Shucks”.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Wasner and Ehrens wrote the album like a post-dial-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"" target=""_blank"">Postal Service</a>-- he sent her tracks, she filled in the lyrics and melodies-- and as a team, they bring out the best in each other. White Life’s neo-new-wave self-titled 2011 debut was solidly catchy if a little faceless, but here Wasner’s husky, charismatic vocals bring his tracks to life. And as for Wasner herself, she’s had a busy and stylistically varied couple of years: since Wye Oak’s excellently brooding 2011 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15195-civilian/""><i>Civilian</i></a>, she’s released a few singles with her art-pop side project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30664-flock-of-dimes/"">Flock of Dimes</a> and made cameos on albums from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28423-future-islands/"">Future Islands</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/"">Titus Andronicus</a>, basically becoming the go-to name in indie rock's “elegantly forlorn female voice"" Rolodex entry. Which is why it’s refreshing to hear her sound like she’s having so much damn <i>fun</i> on <i>Dungeonesse</i>. Ehrens’ bright and bouyant tracks bring out a lighter side of Wasner: Overtop a cascade of glimmering synths, she’s never sounded as playful as she does on the great lead-off single “Drive You Crazy”, while the Dev Hynes-like beat on the swooning “This Could Be Home” is punctuated with samples of her sighs and laughter.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Dungeonesse’s sound is poised somewhere between the past and present. Their take on the poppier side of modern R&amp;B would sound at home on a playlist with Jessie Ware and Solange, but they’re also trying to reanimate a very specific mid-90s vibe-- think Jock Jams for a private party rather than a whole bleacher-rocking stadium. T</span><span>hey embrace their influences wholeheartedly, enough to bring the past vividly into the present moment. It’s pretty amazing how well they get the vibe down: If you played “Cadillac” for someone and told them it was a long-lost would-be dance hit from 1994, they wouldn’t bat an eyelash. But like a few other tracks, “Cadillac” almost sinks under the weight of the album’s most glaring problem: They’ve yet to make a convincing case for why there should ever be a rap verse in a Dungeonesse song. TT the Artist lends a couple of hip-hop Mad Libs lines (“Get-get on up/ Feel the groove”) to the otherwise excellent “This Could Be Home”, and Baltimore emcee DDm’s cliche-ridden verse on “Cadillac” isn’t much more imaginative. Maybe this is just the one place where Dungeonesse studied the 90s dance hit songbook a little too hard; after all, </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNbRMG-4wAI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>the dude from Real McCoy</span></a><span> wasn’t exactly Andre 3000.</span></p>
<p>It’s funny what a difference a couple years makes. Five years ago, it would have been a lot rarer to hear a singer firmly rooted in indie-folk territory gushing about 90s dance pop and her <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2012/12/11/dungeonesse-baltimore-band/1761977/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“youthful fantasies growing up, listening to Mariah Carey and trying to recreate [the] vocals</a>.” But in 2013, that sentiment feels commonplace enough for Wasner’s comment about “reclaiming pop” to almost feel dated. After all, the boundaries that used to separate “pop” from “indie” are corroding from both sides. One example of many? Jenn Wasner has made a very good pop record... and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15399-mariah-carey-beautiful-ft-miguel/"">new Mariah Carey song</a> opens with a warm, fuzzy riff that sounds like something lifted out of a Wye Oak song.</p></div>"|18003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18003-dungeonesse-dungeonesse/|7.7|Lindsay Zoladz

Thankfully the easy digital exchange of music and the influx of new participants in the culture who aren’t bound by received orthodoxies has helped to break this taxonomical fever, and the dance music artists most worth paying attention to right now are the ones paying the least attention to the lines drawn between styles.; ones like Moscow-born, Chicago-raised, Brooklyn-based producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29397-slava/"" target=""_blank"">Slava</a> Balasanov, for instance.</p>
<p>Balasanov (who records using just his first name) has in the past been associated with the seapunk and witch house movements, but that’s more a side-effect of putting out music on labels like Coral Records and Tri Angle than because of any particular stylistic affinity. He identifies simply as a house musician, which is much closer to the truth, although still inexact. On his debut full-length, <i>Raw Solutions</i>, Balasanov gives the impression of someone taking all of house's splintered, baffling stylistic descendants, and attempting to fuse them back into one unified whole.</p>
<p>While <i>Raw Solutions</i> takes a holistic view towards house, with an apparent goal of touching on every possible variation of the form, Balasanov obviously has some favorites. He gets the most mileage out of a Chicago-specific stylistic continuum that starts in first-wave house and moves on through ghetto house, juke, and footwork, folding an entire evolutionary branch back in on itself in an atemporal collage of stuttering high-speed beats, raunchy vocal loops, and retro-ravey synths.</p>
<p>As interesting as Balasanov’s attempt to create an ur-house may be-- as well as his excursions further afield into R&amp;B, moombahton, and beyond-- his emulations of those sounds wouldn’t be proper tributes unless they bumped. Which they do, it turns out. <i>Raw Solutions</i> can offer the armchair musicologist hours of entertainment dissecting it, but stepping away from the analytical perspective reveals it to be a very solid collection of viscerally compelling dance music.</p>
<p>Balasanov has a deeply intuitive understanding of house’s build-and-release dynamic, as well as its give and take with its audience, which he applies in interesting ways. The return from the breakdown on the opening track, “Werk”, which nods at salsa and 90s club music, is a piece of subtle, nuanced craftsmanship that’s the polar opposite of the walloping EDM drop. The triptych of “Girls on Dick”, “Wait”, and “On It” comprise a two-part exploration of ghetto house’s hypnotic salaciousness, split up by a brief, juxtapositional trip into chillwave-inflected ambience.</p>
<p><i>Raw Solutions</i> is more ambitious than the average dance album, both in terms of the span of sonic territory that it covers and its attempts to synthesize all of it into one cohesive work. And it’s more successful than most. Track-by-track, the music’s potent, but like Balasanov’s approach to making it, it’s much more than simply the sum of its parts.</p></div>"|17915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17915-slava-raw-solutions/|7.8|Miles Raymer

The line packs a double meaning, as the entire album is Grant mapping exactly where he's at after the fiery dissolution of a relationship with a man who a mere album ago was the one. Grant's route is not complicated-- really just a rough ride to downtown Fuck You and back, his hatred for his ex occasionally outpaced by his own self-loathing.</p>
<p>In his previous life, Grant helmed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/878-the-czars/"" target=""_blank"">the Czars</a>, giving Denver bragging rights to a decent band in the late 1990s. After the band fell apart, Grant cleaned up and came out, and collaborated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4827-midlake/"" target=""_blank"">Midlake</a> for his 2010 solo debut <i>Queen of Denmark</i>. In the intervening years Grant contracted HIV and went public about his status on stage during a performance with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5681-hercules-and-love-affair/"" target=""_blank"">Hercules and Love Affair</a> last summer. <i>Pale Green Ghost</i>'s themes and energy dovetail out of all of this-- it's an intense, angry record of inconsolable heartbreak, crooned with authority over luscious electro. Though not strictly for the disco, perhaps for the post-disco comedown and hungover dejection, producer Birgir Þórarinsson (of Iceland's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1803-gusgus/"" target=""_blank"">GusGus</a>) bouys the record and keeps it from capsizing under the weight of its own emotional baggage.</p>
<p><i>Pale Green Ghosts</i> is defined by Grant's willingness to broadcast directly from his hell; he's a bit of a serial confessor, and the confessions are marked by blitheness that belies just how much he did care, how far from love he has fallen. He sings the songs of a man with little else to lose. There is not much the way of self-preservation, which can be a touch brutal, as when he addresses his diagnosis on ""Ernest Borgnine"": ""Doc ain't lookin’ at me, says I got the disease/ Now what did you expect, you spent your life on your knees."" At times his anguish is refined: ""There are days when I think about you/ And on those days I really feel like a fool, because/ You don’t deserve to have somebody think about you,"" as he sings on ""You Don't Have To"". Other times the lyrics are visceral, like day-after break-up texts, clamoring to inflict the hurt right back ""You don’t have to say things that you don’t mean/ It just embarrasses me/ because you think you’re so fucking cool.""</p>
<p>Grant's regal baritone makes his sadness and his anger sound that much more serious-- but throughout the album there's some delight mixed in with all the spite, a sadistic little smirk lodged in the flesh-ripping sarcasm. On ""GMF"", he flips between braggadocio (""But I am the greatest motherfucker that you’re ever going to meet"") and backhands (""You think I hate myself but it’s you I hate""). ""Remember how we used to fuck all night long?"" he asks on ""You Don't Have To"", only to answer, ""Neither do I."" It's eviscerating and almost funny, but maybe not ha-ha funny. On the chorus of ""Vietnam"" he extends the metaphor of just how his ex has laid his life to waste, but the real decimation comes with the outro: ""And the only thing that brings me any comfort/ Is the knowledge that no matter who you’re with/ You’ll always be alone."" Grant is plummeting to the depths, and exacting payback through incisive emotional terror as he goes down.</p>
<p>Grant's ease of disclosure can be unnerving,  but it's this sense that nothing is (seemingly) too private for him to share in a song that makes <i>Pale Green Ghosts</i> so potent and, ultimately, accessible. If you have ever felt splayed by life, made powerless by circumstance, you can find yourself seething right along.</p></div>"|18070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18070-john-grant-pale-green-ghosts/|7.0|Jessica Hopper

The year was 1978, maybe 79. Like the bikers, Kim and Kelley listened to Hank Williams and the Everly Brothers; when Kelley was 16 she watched </span><i>The Song Remains the Same</i><span> on acid and the souvenir she kept from her trip was this dead-serious conviction that she wanted to be Jimmy Page. Other people's songs were too hard to figure out, so they made up their own. Nobody else would play with them (Kim: ""This is Dayton, Ohio. You know the NGA kids: No Girls Allowed. Motherfuckers.""), so they played with themselves. The angel-voiced twins kept booking scuzzy bar gigs and kept writing songs with no greater ambition than staving off boredom. ""There was no scene,"" Kelley recalled years later, ""You made up your own fun.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Kim considered herself a guitarist first and foremost. She'd been playing since she was 11, but shortly after she moved to Boston in her mid-20s, she tried out for a band called Pixies whose two current members suggested she learn bass. All the better that she'd never played one before; the <i>Boston Phoenix</i> classified ad she'd answered had said, ""Please, no chops."" They asked Kelley to be the drummer but she didn't feel like leaving Dayton, so she said no. For the next seven years, Kim sang backup and played bass in the Pixies, but mostly she was cool for a living. The kind of cool that people <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56W16EMxi54"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mythologize in songs years later</a>. The kind of cool that dominoes immeasurably: in the same way that we'll never know exactly how many babies are on this earth because of Sade, we will never know how many girls picked up bass guitars and started bands because of Kim Deal's grinning, invitingly normal, yes-even-<i>you</i>-can-do-this-too charm. It was the kind of cool that irrevocably scrambles people's ideas of what cool actually is. ""Kim would come straight from work, so she had skirt-suits and office pumps on a lot,"" recalled Tanya Donelly, then of Throwing Muses, who accompanied Pixies on their first European tour. ""So many people in [the Boston scene were] trying to look cool, and meanwhile the coolest person there is dressed like a secretary. I have to say, in a day it changed my perception of what was cool.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As the Pixies' cult fanbase grew throughout late 80s and early 90s, Kim's artistic contributions diminished with each record. Depending on who you ask, she was either almost kicked out of or almost quit the famously tumultuous band a few different times before Frank Black sent out indie rock's most notorious fax in the summer of 1992, letting everyone know that the Pixies were through. In the liner notes to the 20th anniversary reissue of </span><i>Last Splash</i><span>, the phenomenal second album from her other band the Breeders, Kim sums up the Pixies' explosive seven-year run in a single, tellingly faceless sentence: ""[W]e started by driving ourselves in a van with no record contract, went on to appear on front covers of the English music press (while still largely unknown in the States) and ended when the lead singer quit the band to pursue a solo career.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The Breeders began in earnest when Pixies and Throwing Muses came off that first European tour, at some point during which Kim and Donelly decided they wanted to make a record together. They recruited a British bassist they'd met on the road, Josephine Wiggs, and their Boston friend Carrie Bradley would play violin. In 1990, they released the great, eerily primal <i>Pod</i>, which Kurt Cobain loved, cited as an inspiration on Nirvana, and later dubbed, ""an epic that will never let you forget your ex-girlfriend."" After that, Donelly left to form Belly, Dayton's Jim Macpherson became their permanent drummer, and the Breeders found themselves in search of a new guitarist so they could go back into the studio with the bouncy, grungy demos they'd been writing in 1992. Kim knew somebody back in Dayton. Could she play well? Well, the thing was that she couldn't play at all. But she figured she could teach her pretty quickly, because she was her twin.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That's some of the psychic energy fueling one of alternative rock's most unlikely platinum records and most enduring masterpieces, the Breeders' </span><i>Last Splash</i><span>: an indie-famous frontwoman who'd spent the last couple of years feeling increasingly fed up and creatively muzzled at her high-profile day job; an untrained lead guitarist joyriding up and down the fretboard and riding high on the freedom of </span><i>please, no chops</i><span>; and maybe above all else a decade-delayed bar band family reunion. It's no wonder that 20 years later, <i>Last Splash</i> still sounds as sloppy and beguiling and warm as the day it was pressed. Although the songs were meticulously crafted and revised, and although the post-<i>Nevermind</i> boom had made the audience for a record this singularly weird suddenly visible, in the end the Breeders sound like a couple of kids from Dayton (and one like-minded Brit) making up their own fun.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Last Splash</i> is a noise-pop record in the fullest sense of both of those words: It is a symphony of feedback but the melodies holding it all together are sweet enough to rot your teeth. From the squalling, rhythmic dissonance of ""Roi"" to the melodic Lynchian lullaby ""Mad Lucas"", the record is full of warm, damaged beauty. Fresh off a tour with Nirvana, the Breeders drove to San Francisco in a blizzard to record </span><i>Last Splash</i><span> with veteran producer Mark Freegard in the winter of 1993, and the reissue’s liner notes describe the process as a series of sonic experiments. What's that corrosive whir that opens ""S.O.S.""? It's Kelley's sewing machine fed directly through a Marshall amp, because why not. The distorted vocal on ""Cannonball"" happened because Kim (who shares a producer’s credit with Freegard) wondered what it'd sound like to sing through a harmonica mic and when they play the song live, they still get that particular tone of the iconic opening vocal (""Ahhhhhoooo-oooh/Ahhhhhoooo-oooh"") not through some custom pedal, but by putting a styrofoam cup over the mic. At times they resorted to measures even more DIY than that. The best take of Bradley's warbling strings on ""Mad Lucas"" was the one where, by her account, ""Kim and Kelley grabbed me on each side and shook me and quaked me while I played.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All of which might make<i> Last Splash</i> sound like a haphazard and amateurish affair, but the collection of demos and the 1992 live show included in the extensive <i>LSXX</i> reissue tell a more complex story. Unlike their Dayton buddies Guided by Voices (the Breeders' own cover of ""Shocker in Gloomtown"" made the reissue, along with the rest of 1994’s excellent </span><i>Head to Toe</i><span> EP), the Breeders crafted, road tested, and revised their tunes. Check, for one example, the completely reworked demo of ""No Aloha"" against the one that made the album.</span><span> As all the extras on the reissue attest, the genius of the Breeders lies in the balance between being tirelessly tinkering perfectionists who still understand how to embrace creative serendipity. So<i> Last Splash</i> is a tight record that's also alive with happy accidents. Perhaps the most famous example: the bassline's hesitant entrance on ""Cannonball""-- and we're talking about one of the most iconic basslines of the 90s-- was actually the product of a fortunate mistake. In a rehearsal, Wiggs played the last note of the riff flat (twice in a row) but everybody thought it sounded cool, so it became a part of the song.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Wiggs and Macpherson are the unsung heroes of </span><i>Last Splash</i><span>; a driving-but-just-loose-enough rhythm section, they gave the sprawl a backbone. But the Deals are the record’s charismatic center. It’s hard to imagine a frontwoman more perfect for a record so fixated on the tension between distressed textures and gleefully hooky melody. From her mirror-fogging enunciation of “No bye/No/A-lo-ha” to the way she delivers the title syllable of “Hag” like a cutting sidelong glance, each note comes out of her mouth affixed with a halo of cartoon dirt, like the one that hovers over Pigpen. Expressive yet enigmatic enough to cover a whole range of emotions, Kim’s voice embodies that dirty-prettiness that makes </span><i>Last Splash</i><span>’s appeal so complex and hard to pin down. In a 1995 issue of </span><i>Spin</i><span>, Charles Aaron called </span><i>Last Splash</i><span> ""the rare album that had all the I-need-you and you-gross-me-out emotions seamlessly bound together."" It can be mean one second (""You’re a nuisance, and I don't like dirt"") and then deliver something as vulnerable and classically tender as ""Do You Love Me Now?"" the next. That it doesn’t always want to admit that it’s a romantic record only makes it more of a romantic record. The point is that it's sweet and gross and guarded and needy and cutting and gleeful because love can be all of those things too.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The reissue is available either as a three-CD package or a vivid, electric-brite vinyl box set, though either prompts a fair question: “Why should I spring for a special edition of an album I can probably still find in the dollar bin?” For any Breeders fan, though, the extras make a convincing case. The live album (recorded in Stockholm in 1994) and disc of rarities and demos put the finished product in context, while the array of EPs show off the wide stylistic range of everything the Breeders could do well. They’re all worth a listen, though the wooly pop of </span><i>Safari</i><span> (Donnelly’s last recording with the band) and the later, comparatively aggro </span><i>Head to Toe</i><span> (featuring the great, Wiggs-penned title track-- a fan favorite) are the best of the bunch. The less essential </span><i>Divine Hammer</i><span> EP is notable for featuring “Do You Love Me Now Jr”-- a fittingly titled duet that features J Mascis, who recalls his amusingly ill-fated attempt to produce some Breeders tracks in the liner notes. “I was not the best producer. I only wanted to work until 7 p.m. Kim got up about 3 p.m., so that didn’t leave much time before I would bail.” And as the duet proves, their voices are about as compatible as their working hours.</span></p>
<p>Still, it was Mascis who once succinctly summed up the irony of Deal’s two great bands: “The Breeders seemed bigger than the Pixies, and now the Pixies are way bigger than the Breeders.” In both instances, it was a matter of being at the right place at the right time. With <i>Last Splash</i>, the Breeders were poised to ride the cresting alt-rock wave that the Pixies had inspired but just missed out on, and when the Pixies reunited in 2004, the mounting nostalgia for late 80s/early 90s indie rock made it the perfect time for a long-delayed victory lap. But now it’s the Breeders’ turn to bask in a little bit of that nostalgic glory. <i>LSXX</i> is proof of an enduring benefit of sounding like nobody else: 20 years later, these songs still sound fresh. The undeniable “Cannonball” may have made <i>Last Splash</i> an unlikely mainstream hit, but as Kim reminds us in the liner notes, “This is an indie record. Put out by 4AD.” She says “indie” proudly-- like it means something personal. And <i>Last Splash</i> proves it still can. As big as it made the Breeders, it has a scrappy intimacy that captures what those early, unrecorded, make-your-own-fun Deal sister bar gigs must have sounded like. A million alt rock fans and all the bikers in Dayton, Ohio can't be wrong.</p></div>"|17942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17942-the-breeders-lsxx/|9.0|Lindsay Zoladz

Even better news for him is that his seventh album as Bibio, <i>Silver Wilkinson</i>, will not be rendered redundant by <i>Tomorrow’s Harvest</i>. That wasn’t the case last time BoC released new material; the two would namedrop each other in interviews, and when <i>The Campfire Headphase</i> finally<i> </i>allowed six-strings into the mix, they were modeled after the kind of gelatinous, wobbly guitars that defined Bibio’s early work on Mush. The presumptive show of mutual respect was the biggest thing Wilkinson had going for him at the time, but now, he shares not only a label with his heroes, but a similar quandary: after creating such a definitive document of his sound, he faces the redundancy that comes with competing with his own work.</p>
<p>He actively courts this problem on <i>Silver Wilkinson, </i>which junks the plasticine electro-pop that marred <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15279-mind-bokeh/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mind Bokeh </i></a>and returns to the warm splendor of 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13125-ambivalence-avenue/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ambivalence Avenue</i></a>, the record which began his second, more rewarding phase. It was only then that he fully explored what it meant to be a producer with vision; he dabbled in songwriting, beatmaking, crate-digging and acoustic strumming, sometimes all at once, unifying it with an aesthetic that established an equilibrium between the pastoral and the digital (and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ckz2Uultmg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">proved perfect for selling Kindles</a>). It’s a an all-inclusive, welcoming sound that puts a wide range of potential conflicts of interests-- wafting British folk, Dilla-fied hip-hop instrumentals, psychedelic light funk-- into the same frame, consistently providing pleasant surprises and never making a huge deal about how diverse it was. </p>
<p>In short, Bibio relies on an accumulative effect more than the strength of any individual songs. But when the ratios get thrown off even in the slightest, the results come off as alternately distracted or monotonous. The first four songs on <i>Silver Wilkinson </i>contain no sound you haven’t already heard from him: aqueous atmosphere, washed-out acoustics, Wilkinson’s haunted vocals. They’re just allotted in less satisfying proportions; instrumentals “The First Daffodils” and “Wulf” are too short to offer immersion, too long to qualify as interludes while “Dye the Water Green” and “Mirroring All” are humble folk songs burdened with too much found sound and drift to justify their five-minute lengths. Immediately after, ""À tout à l'heure"" establishes some kind of momentum with a nimble acoustic riff and a spirited, stomping rhythm, but by the time you get there, <i>Silver Wilkinson </i>has exhausted nearly one third of its run time.</p>
<p>And that gets to the mundane issue at the center of <i>Silver Wilkinson,</i> which is that it’s a layering of holding patterns. It either idles too long in genial background, or gets to relatively exciting productions which specifically recall his previous work. The combination of light, bumping funk and analog nerd synths on “Look At Orion!” is a canny move on Bibio’s part, establishing himself as the missing link between labelmates Boards of Canada and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>, but it barely builds on that idea. “You” is sequenced as the literal centerpiece of <i>Silver Wilkinson </i>and the figurative one-- the hiccupping samples and percussive jump cuts remind you that his whole aesthetic is more hip-hop than anything. There’s something underhanded about it, though; it’s meant to be a gaudy display of Wilkinson’s range surrounded by the overt naturalism of “Sycamore Silhouetting” and “Raincoat”, when really it’s just a minor variation on <i>Ambivalence Avenue’s </i>“Fire Ant”.</p>
<p>None of the above makes <i>Silver Wilkinson </i>a bad album, far from it. It just questions what Bibio’s true strengths are; the melodies and arrangements are <i>nice</i>, but does he have a go-to skill besides curation? If it’s your first experience with Bibio, there’s a lot to like here and thankfully, <i>Silver Wilkinson </i>renders <i>Mind Bokeh’s </i>“Take Off Your Shirt” as distant and out of character as an embarrassing Spring Break memory. And yet, it can make someone who’s followed Bibio since the beginning nostalgic for the willingness to take that kind of risk. The problem is that while <i>Ambivalence Avenue </i>was a pleasant surprise in all forms, an astounding leap from an unexpected source that constantly offered new sounds, <i>Silver Wilkinson </i>provides the same thing without the surprises. And all that’s left is the pleasant part.</p></div>"|18006.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18006-bibio-silver-wilkinson/|6.2|Ian Cohen

What if Buffalo Records hadn’t gone out of business just prior to the album’s release? What if <i>Black Beauty</i> had actually hit stores? What if it hadn’t languished in limbo until years after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6124-arthur-lee/"">Arthur Lee</a>’s death? Would it have stopped Love’s slide into obscurity? Would it have signaled a comeback for the man who masterminded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11429-forever-changes-collectors-edition/""><i>Forever Changes</i></a>, still one of the most complex and compelling artifacts of 1960s Los Angeles? Would his life and career have played out any differently? Would we think of him today as something other than a cult artist, inspired as well as damned by his era?</p>
<p>It’s difficult to imagine any answers to those questions, but it says a lot about Lee that the album even raises these what-ifs and coulda-beens. The very qualities that made him such a fascinating voice-- restlessness, excitability, paranoia, perfectionism, single-mindedness-- may have doomed any commercial prospects more than his notorious fear of travel ever did. After recording <i>Forever Changes</i>, he fired the band and hired new musicians to take their places. Every subsequent album featured a different line-up, although the changes seem based more on personality than on musical direction or ability. Never stagnant, Love was in constant flux, always in a state of development but never quite arriving. So the operative question becomes: Was this the version of Love that Lee had been working toward?</p>
<p>For <i>Black Beauty</i>-- which is finally seeing release via <a href=""http://highmoonrecords.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">High Moon Records</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41758-lost-album-from-love-to-be-released/"">although the reissue has been delayed for two years</a>-- Lee assembled guitarist Melvan Whittington, bass player Robert Rozelle, and drummer Joe Blocker. This may be the hardiest and most muscular of Love’s post-<i>Changes </i>rosters, with remarkable force and range. With crisp production by Paul Rothchild, best known for his work with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5036-the-doors/"">Doors</a>, Love build from a potent blues rock foundation not dissimilar to that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1923-jimi-hendrix/"">Jimi Hendrix</a>, but without the distracting shamanistic persona and guitar pyrotechnics. “Walk Right In” struts into country rock territory, rewriting Cannon’s Jug Stompers 1929 hit into a plea for empathy, and “Beep Beep” attempts a sort of pop reggae, albeit not entirely convincingly.</p>
<p>On the whole, this particular line-up sounds perfectly rough and unrehearsed, generating a tense energy on “Skid” and “Stay Away” even as they suggest a band still figuring out exactly what they can do together. It’s a strong album, but it’s not another <i>Forever Changes</i>, whose accomplishments in retrospect were unrepeatable, or even another <i>Four Sail</i>. On the other hand, Lee wasn’t aiming to craft something in that vein. Still, especially considering the professional setbacks he had faced in the years leading up to <i>Black Beauty</i>-- which includes being dropped by Elektra and shuffling through a series of independent labels-- Lee sounds engaged and invigorated, forgoing the bitterness that had rankled the band for a slightly more hopeful outlook. On stand-out “Can’t Find It”, he sings, “Every time I cry my heart out, and every time I play the fool, but there’s gotta be something in this lonely world for me.” The confession is all the more bittersweet for being capped with the line, “but I can’t find it without you.” It’s ostensibly a love song, but could just as easily be addressed to his audience. His creative satisfaction relies on having a listener to complete the circuit, which makes this album’s long shelf life all the sadder.</p></div>"|18125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18125-black-beauty/|7.6|Stephen M.

The tape offered scant contact info save for an address in Olympia, to which one could try writing to acquire lyrics. No telling if the address still works; Gun Outfit have since fled their hometown for the sunnier terrain of Los Angeles. But across their catalogue, Gun Outfit come over as rootless wanderers. They don't sound like a group for whom any fixed address could ever be too reliable.</p>
<p>Gun Outfit's seven-year lifespan has embraced what it means to function underground and sincerely D.I.Y. today, starting as a ""crude folk duo"" to play house shows and taking a decided disinterest in self-promotion. (The band has virtually no web presence save for a barebones Tumblr.) So while there's little telling what exactly they've been up to since 2010's <i>Possession Sound</i>, vocalist/guitarist Dylan Sharp-- who shares songwriting, vocal and lead guitar duties with Carrie Keith-- has at least <a href=""http://pigsmeat.wordpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">penned several philosophical treatises</a> on topics like <a href=""http://pigsmeat.wordpress.com/2013/01/29/kook-mountain/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">working at a weed farm</a>, <a href=""http://pigsmeat.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/permanent-vacation/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""the time/money equation,""</a> and <a href=""http://pigsmeat.wordpress.com/2011/06/20/post-tour/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performing music</a>. <span>""If 'the realm of freedom is established progressively by the development of human powers as an end in itself' and I am freedom rocker, then I have no choice but to develop my limited powers for their own sake and not worry so much about the future and past,"" Sharp wrote in a blog post, quoting Marx. ""There’s always an abandon and immediacy in music which destroys time (much like drugs) which is why I keep coming back to both.""</span></p>
<p>Many of those 2012 tape recordings were recast for <i>Hard Coming Down</i>, Gun Outfit's third LP for Dean Spunt of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5313-no-age/"" target=""_blank"">No Age</a>'s label <a href=""http://www.postpresentmedium.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Post Present Medium</a> and their best album yet; it follows <i>Possession </i>and 2009's <i>Dim Light</i>, both strong, overlooked records with lo-fi K Records abandon and 1980s SST crunch and screech. Gun Outfit's connection to folk music is also clear; those albums' radical bent came through on occasional anti-capitalist lyrical statements, like Sonic Youth covering Woody Guthrie. Across the board, Gun Outfit have appeared less concerned with sharpening the logistics of their aesthetic than with using language and life to inject their songs with the highest possible dosages of their own humanity.</p>
<p>On <i>Hard Coming Down</i>, Gun Outfit exist inside these parameters but with more sophistication and grace than ever, stretching to darker, duskier moods and a spacious, slowcore pace. It's a more serious and multi-dimensional record, its poised weariness the sound of experience and devotion, and the dim-lit hooks are Gun Outfit's finest. They've got a stronger build with new bassist Anton Seder-- sublimely textured guitars spin off one another into an ether of faded memory, next to skeletal patches of warm, crawling psychedelia. Living as city dwellers has Gun Outfit dreaming harder of the countryside, a sentiment Keith directly articulates with gentle, monotone rasp and gorgeous imagery on ""My Love is Wanting Me"". Throughout the record, she sounds like a young Courtney Love covering weary, heartfelt country tunes. ""The load you're towing/ Is draggin' you around,"" Keith sings with sensitive perception on ""High Price to Pay"". ""Why don't you unhitch it/ And find another way?"" Even the choices of vocabulary are wonderfully evocative, channeling a line of road-worn blues that exudes Zen-like calm and collectedness, anchoring what much of this record is about.</p>
<p>At times, Keith and Sharp sing with gospel and blues-inflected twang and moan, conveying notions of gratitude and sorrow, strength and desperation, pride and confused paranoia. There's more Lee Hazlewood than Calvin Johnson in Sharp's straight-talking baritone, which fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3786-silver-jews/"" target=""_blank"">Silver Jews</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a> will enjoy. Some of Sharp's most recurring topics-- questioning the prevailing notions and worth of ambition, money, success, and work in general-- are visited often on <i>Hard Coming Down</i>. As ""Lau Blues"" unfurls, Sharp's stepping away from a hard situation and resisting those who suggest he get a job: ""Gonna cast a download glance and/ Take a backward step,"" he sings, ""And I'll call that dignity/ But you know what I mean."" This smart brand of cerebral slackerism is rare in guitar rock today, and refreshing.</p>
<p>Gun Outfit's best work here is ""Young Lord"", a stunning centerpiece of weed-scented restraint and interlocking guitar mystics that unwind at a snail's pace. In this observant five-minute piece of poetic psychedelia, dreams are whispers of the night, not something to strive for; freedom is for children, not an earned prize. ""Gold/ And goals themselves/ I've never had to worry about a thing,"" Sharp's drawl offers with endearing disaffection. ""High/ High as I've always been/ It's never really meant that much to me."" ""Young Lord"" draws from classic American sounds and yet rejects American ideals, a negation of the hyper-connected, overachieving present.</p>
<p>There was a beautiful and dryly hilarious 16-millimeter short film, ""<a href=""http://vimeo.com/58041699"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Where's Anton</a>"", made to accompany <i>Hard Coming Down</i>, which follows Gun Outfit around L.A. like characters in <i>Slacker</i>. And the band does sound like they just rolled out of Linklater's iconic 90s film-- hanging at their house and discussing things like childhood ambivalence towards school, a recent surreal van ride, an out-of-body experience practicing low harmonies with a horse. There are shots of the band staring at the ocean, backs facing the camera, reminiscent of the painter Edward Hopper. ""Where's Anton"" captures a spirit that pervades <i>Hard Coming Down</i>-- one of a young band preserving an analog life, getting deep into themselves to see what truth they can communicate. The first music you hear in ""Where's Anton"" is ""Young Lord"", paired with the natural sounds of a dog barking and young voices chattering in the distance, the song brought to life-- a serene moment that, like many on <i>Hard Coming Down</i>, will help you find your center.</p></div>"|17817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17817-gun-outfit-hard-coming-down/|8.0|Jenn Pelly

The Philadelphia duo cut their teeth in the city’s unforgiving DIY scene, playing their balls off in every grimy basement, awkwardly located club, and dodgy South Philly mafia bar they could. They built up their reputation with an unflinching work ethic and unwavering positive attitude as well as renown for their crushing, complex tunes, eventually catching the eye of <a href=""http://www.candlelightrecordsusa.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Candlelight Records</a>. At hometown shows, their unwieldy name (pronounced “sad-juh-kay-sha”) never really held them back; everyone just wanted to see Fred and Evan play, regardless of what was scrawled across the flyer. And all that hard graft paid off. After releasing a handful of demos and splits with other Philly bands Ominous Black and Grass, Sadgiqacea powered onwards and upwards to ink a deal with semi-local indie powerhouse Candlelight. The result, <i>False Prism</i>, is an impressive debut album, and a beginning to this next chapter in the tale of a little band that could.</div>
<p>Sadgiqacea make no bones about their love for all things trippy and psychedelic, and those leanings color many of the spacey, serpentine riffs that make up the bulk of <i>False Prism</i>. The raw, crackling energy of their live show bleeds through, thanks to Chris Grigg’s hands-off recording technique and the album’s warm, breathable mix. Album opener “False Segments” starts off strong, zig-zagging into a churning neckbreaker of a riff. The next eight minutes unfold slowly and deliberately, channeling the best moments of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"" target=""_blank"">Baroness</a> and elemental fury of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"" target=""_blank"">Neurosis</a> without parroting either. The weeping violin at the end is a nice touch, and ripples smoothly into “False Cross”, with its spare, tribal drums and lurching sludge riff. It’s one of the longest tracks on <i>False Prism</i>, clocking nearly 11 minutes, but also its most engaging; it ebbs and flows in waves of distortion, and both members share vocal duties, alternating between a litany of hoarse shouts, painful rasps, and mellow, almost chanted clean singing. It’s an epic and a funeral dirge, at once grandiose and terribly sad. The title track feels tame in comparison, with its muted chords, blastbeats, and cold black metal overtones. Even with its mid-song break into downtuned, downtrodden doom, it’s the most straightforward song on here, and the most unexpected for those who’ve not yet learned that Sadgiqacea aren’t much in the habit of playing things straight.</p>
<div>They’re a sludgy doom band at heart, but are bursting with far too many ideas to allow them to fester inside any one constricting genre tag. “True Darkness” drives the point home with nearly 15 minutes of tightly controlled, clever drumming and heavyweight riffs that crawl between a simple chug and frenetic, melodic tremolo. The vocalist is livid, howling into the wind, his words torn from his lips faster than he can form their shape. Halfway through, he breaks down, and all goes quiet; a solitary guitar picks out a couple of notes, an ominous tune with the most minimal beat in the background. It builds, then collapses into heaving rubble, cut through with spacey effects and crashing ride cymbals overpowering it all. They ride out leaving nothing but chaos in their wake, snickering over the shock that flashed across your face when it all came crashing down. The final moments of “True Darkness” make for an intense ending to an intense journey, and <i>False Prism</i> is one hell of a good beginning. One gets the feeling that Sadgiqacea have only just begun their voyage to the stars.</div></div>"|17980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17980-sadgiqacea-false-prism/|6.5|Kim Kelly

Judging from his EPs, he also hopes to emulate their careers. As with his much-cited indie and dream-pop influences-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a>, to name a couple-- Tatum tailors his ambitions to the format. With an EP's expectations and stakes lowered, he builds on the previous full-length and takes some artistic risks to push his sound forward. His second EP, <i>Empty Estate, </i>has the same relationship to its full-length predecessor as the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14937-golden-haze-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Golden Haze</i></a> EP did his debut: it’s noticeably bolder, sounds more expensive and crafted with live performance in mind. But it’s also the first time Tatum’s music hasn't improved on what came before.</p>
<p>On <i>Gemini </i>and <i>Golden Haze</i>, Tatum's strengths lay in writing modest indie rock songs that stuck, as he found an exact point where familiarity didn’t cross over to derivation. Unlike most current bands in the dream-pop/shoegaze nebula, you sense that Tatum starts with melody and adds atmosphere as opposed to the other way around. With <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16969-nocturne/"" target=""_blank"">Nocturne</a>, </i>you could hear a concerted effort to be a little more immodest and little less indie on “The Blue Dress” and specifically “Paradise”. These songs weren’t dance music per se, but they had rhythms and fleshier arrangements that Tatum built knowing he’d have a full band at his disposal. <i>Empty Estate </i>continues this push towards extroversion. Where Wild Nothing songs were once centered firmly on guitar with synths filling out the margins, <i>Empty Estate</i> inverts the ratio, leaning toward glittery electro-pop.</p>
<p><i>Empty Estate </i>tries to guide Wild Nothing towards a more physically charged sound, and it’s not always an easy transition. Tatum still has the same wispy vocals, and the Byrne/Bowie talk/sing approach on the verses of “A Dancing Shell” are as jarring as the typically moony chorus is soothing. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8902-wild-nothing"">Tatum will be the first to admit he doesn’t put too much stock in his lyrics</a> and his chosen genres can tolerate plenty of nonsense. But it's a little hard to take when Tatum’s stonefaced sincerity doesn’t break on a line like, “I’ll be your monkey/ Every night/ If it makes you love me.”</p>
<p>There’s a chance Tatum could make a full adjustment by Wild Nothing’s third album-- he still hasn’t written a bum song. After <i>Empty Estate, </i>what he <i>has </i>done is composed a couple of bum instrumentals. You can’t just toss out “On Guyot” and “Hachiko” if you value <i>Empty Estate </i>as a full experience; credit where it’s due, the entire thing is carefully sequenced to play as a continuous, single serving. But Tatum’s arranging skills lag far behind his songwriting and the instrumentals lack any sort of textural contrast or field of depth. Still, the EP as a whole suggests that, regardless of the outcome, a gradually evolving songwriter like Tatum benefits from not waiting two years between releases.</p></div>"|18106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18106-wild-nothing-empty-estate-ep/|6.6|Ian Cohen

They’d been touring almost nonstop throughout the 1980s and were understandably growing tired of their assigned instruments and their assumed roles in the band. So in 1988, when they holed up in a local studio to demo new songs, drummer Bill Berry called dibs on bass for one tune, while bass player Mike Mills moved over to keyboards. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11611-peter-buck/"">Peter Buck</a> set aside his electric guitar and strummed a mandolin. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5999-michael-stipe/"">Michael Stipe</a> sang. According to Tony Fletcher’s massive band bio <i>Perfect Circle, </i>now out in its sixth edition in 25 years: “The process was partly an education, forcing themselves to learn to play equipment they’d often taken for granted, and partly to explore the inherent chemistry of the group, to see whether R.E.M. remained R.E.M. even when its characters changed their roles.”</p>
<p>The immediate result of this intraband game of musical chairs was “You Are the Everything”, a standout on their sixth album and major-label debut, <i>Green</i>. Against a chorus of nighttime crickets, Buck’s mandolin almost jangles, Berry’s bassline dances in the moonlight, and the effect is a curious Southern pastoral without precedent in R.E.M.’s catalog. The song would become crucial, however, to their future output, providing a musical and logistical blueprint for much of <i>Out of Time</i> and <i>Automatic for the People</i>-- the band’s most popular albums, which exploded their traditional drums-bass-guitar-singer line-up.</p>
<p>This alone would have been sufficient to establish <i>Green</i> as pivotal in R.E.M.’s catalog. Released on November 8, 1988-- the day Vice President George H.W. Bush was elected as the 41st President of the United States of America-- the album marks many firsts for the band. It was their first effort for a major label, and so understandably represented a gigantic risk. It was their first to go double platinum, which proves the risk paid off. It was their first to gain a popular foothold in the UK-- testament to Warner Brothers’ international reach. And yet, it’s that complete rethinking of the band’s line-up that defines <i>Green</i> 25 years later; listening to this newly remastered anniversary edition, it’s impossible to miss that sense of renewed purpose within the band, which both expanded and solidified their sound. If nothing else here sounds quite like anything R.E.M. had done in the past, it still sounded undeniably like R.E.M.</p>
<p><i>Green</i> is an album of experiments. Freed from their usual roles, the band members tinkered with sugary pop, martial arena punk, fluttering folk rock, country flourishes, and dramatic dirges. Especially on the second side (referred to by the band as the “metal” side, referring not to the genre but to the element), these experiments collide for a set of songs as strong and as diverse as any sequence on previous albums. Stipe’s vocals overlap eerily on “The Wrong Child” to create an unsettlingly spectral roundelay. Against the military stomp of “Orange Crush” he sings through a megaphone that lends his vocals a corroded quality appropriate to the subject matter (namely, the degenerative effects of Agent Orange on U.S. soldiers). Foretelling the glam-rock attack of <i>Monster</i>, “Turn You Inside-Out” is a scabrous examination of the entertainer/audience relationship, while “I Remember California” grows so darkly ominous that it threatens to sink the Golden State in the Pacific. </p>
<p>Whereas <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17079-document/""><i>Document</i></a>, their final release for I.R.S. Records, sounded grimly solemn, <i>Green </i>is often positively giddy as the band try out new tricks and as Stipe grows more confident and charismatic as a frontman. The album contains some of the jauntiest and most upbeat tunes they had ever recorded, revealing a self-deflating sense of humor as well as a sophisticated self-awareness. “Pop Song ‘89” is a pop song about pop songs, with Stipe introducing himself (“Hi! Hi! Hi!”) before wondering, “Should we talk about the weather?/... Should we talk about the government?” Both subjects had figured prominently into his lyrics on previous albums, and R.E.M. were trying to figure out what to sing about next.</p>
<p>The joviality of tunes like “Get Up” and especially “Stand”, which dominated the “air” (or first) side, proved divisive, alienating long-time fans while attracting new listeners. Because MTV played the hell out of “Stand” and because this pop urge would culminate in the questionable “Shiny Happy People”, it’s all too easy to dismiss the pop songs on <i>Green</i>. They certainly haven’t aged as well as some of the other, graver tunes, but it’s intriguing to hear R.E.M. bring to the fore a playfulness that had previously only been shunted to the margins. Plus, there’s a certain charm to their unguarded goofiness, which seemed at odds with the band’s sense of purpose and Stipe’s cultivated enigma. And it extended to the packaging as well: the spot-gloss 4s on the over, the spiraling tree trunk on the CD, and especially the untitled closing track, which made it impossible to request at live shows. ""Untitled"" grows out of the same pop impulse that motivates “Stand”, yet the result is wide-eyed and big-hearted as Stipe delivers some of his most direct lyrics. The music is simple, shaky, even arguably unprofessional, as Buck lays down a rudimentary drumbeat and Mills interjects an emphatic organ riff. Even on a major label, R.E.M. were still trying to shirk the trappings of their newfound celebrity, to play with their own image, to bend the language of pop music to convey their own ideas rather than fix their ideas to the mechanics of pop.</p>
<p>Still, R.E.M. were professionals. In the studio they might have switched things up, but on stage they hunkered down into their individual roles and did their jobs with exciting efficiency. The success of first <i>Document</i> and then <i>Green</i> meant they were playing increasingly larger venues, and the long run of dates burned them out so much that they would decide not to tour for their next two albums. So the live bonus disc on this reissue, recorded at the Greensboro Coliseum in North Carolina (friendly territory for the band, as the crowd on this recording makes clear), shows R.E.M. at the height of their abilities as a live act, with a strong batch of songs and a relentless intensity. The tempos are quick, the dynamic rowdy-- almost impatient on “The One I Love” and “Life and How to Live It”. Songs from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12464-murmur-deluxe-edition/""><i>Murmur</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15625-lifes-rich-pageant-25th-anniversary-edition/""><i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i></a> sound rejuvenated in this context, meshing naturally with the newer material; early versions of “Belong” and “Low” point the way forward. “This song goes out to… you,” Stipe says before the band launches into “You Are the Everything”.</p>
<p><i>Green</i> is defined by the tweaks R.E.M. made to their creative process, by the restlessness that destroys many bands but somehow revitalized these four musicians. For that reason, this reissue of <i>Green</i> is incomplete: it lacks those original demos R.E.M. made in Athens, when they were still figuring out that they could shuffle the deck, exchange instruments and roles, redefine the band without changing its membership. On the other hand, the concert disc provides some valuable insight into the afterlives of these songs: how the band lived with them, how they played them, mutated them. On these live tracks, you can hear the old bar band that cut its teeth covering “Stepping Stone” and “Hippy Hippy Shake” on cramped stages in tiny clubs around Athens. In other words, R.E.M. at their greenest.</p></div>"|18049.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18049-rem-green-25th-anniversary-deluxe-edition/|8.4|Stephen M. Deusner

Detroit's Adam Lee Miller and Nicola Kuperus had the same mix of dance music sounds and punk aesthetics that their largely New York-based peers did, but none of the downtown glitz and coked-up post-9/11 escapism. Instead they projected something more intense and unsettling, a faceless anxiety that pitched French existentialist horror through a bleak Midwestern Rust Belt worldview.</p>
<p>Over a decade after the release of their first album, most of ADULT.’s electroclash-affiliated contemporaries have fallen off the map, and the post-millennial tension that made them seem so timely back then has evolved into something different. But that sense of deep alienation still pervades <i>The Way Things Fall</i>, the duo’s fifth  album, although like the music it’s embedded in, it’s become subtler and more intriguing.</p>
<p>The pair’s approach to making music has previously relied heavily on discomfort: synthesizers and drum machines EQ’d to remove whatever hints of warmth they might once have had, Kuperus’ monotone delivery a microtone off key, an aura of harsh, treble-heavy distortion surrounding pretty much everything. On <i>The Way Things Fall</i>, though, they’ve dialed down the more outright aggression, and aimed more directly for pop appeal than ever before. Everything’s cleaner, smoother, and considerably less prickly.</p>
<p>The apotheosis of this new approach is “Tonight, We Fall”, an easily accessible piece of sleek new wave engineering, with a straightforward rock drum beat, burbling bass, and a recurring synth lead that sticks mainly to a major scale and only barely veers into the kind of woozy pitch bends that are one of the pair’s favorite discomfiting compositional techniques. Kuperus backs up the broadly hooky vocal melody with an emotional performance verging on the melodramatic, and far removed from her usual angry-cyborg style.</p>
<p>Kuperus and Miller haven’t exactly transformed into affable pop artists, though. This newfound emphasis on catchiness is just another vehicle for delivering the same kind of unease that ADULT.’s always specialized in. It’s just sneakier now. On its surface “Tonight, We Fall” reads like a straightforward swooning love song. Kuperus opens the song by asking, “Will we, will we live like this/ Forever,” which is the kind of vaguely philosophical inquiry that we expect a bittersweet new wave love song to ask. But when Kuperus answers her own question things get complicated. “This feeling came over me,” she sings, “It sticks to you, sticks to me/ Forever.” If it’s love she’s talking about, like the song’s tone sets us up to expect, it doesn’t sound like something you’d want to touch. It sounds more like a curse.</p>
<p>Using well-worn pop tropes to establish a set of expectations in the listener only to subvert them as thoroughly as possible is a pattern that repeats itself throughout <i>The Way Things Fall</i>. The stacked arpeggios on “Love Lies” sets up an unhurried <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3075-gary-numan/"" target=""_blank"">Gary Numan</a> groove that Kuperus uses as a platform to declaim on the falseness of human emotion. “Heartbreak” comes on like a 70s space disco jam then drops a creepily dissonant chromatic bridge that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Of course this kind of anxiety is exactly what ADULT.’s fans want from them. For whatever perverse reasons we want to be unsettled by their music, and made psychically uncomfortable. They’ve always delivered, but never before with this sense of style.</p></div>"|17997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17997-adult-the-way-things-fall/|7.7|Miles Raymer
