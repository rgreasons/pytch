The fact that they live above a London pub that stages exhibitions of rectal hand insertions, all while serving Sunday lunch to families, is an almost too-perfect addendum to their bio. <i>Champagne Holocaust</i> is the band’s debut album, a no-budget affair originally released on <a href=""http://fatwhitefamily.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> and now getting a belated North American release after gaining a swell of attention in the UK. The nucleus of the six-piece band is two Northern Irish brothers, Lias and Nathan Saoudi, plus guitarist Saul Adamczewski, formerly of failed indie-punk outfit <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metros"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Metros</a>. If the album sounds like it cost about 10 of their English pence to record, then it probably did—but that’s all part of Fat White Family’s squalid charm, where rampant idiocy, intelligence, and deranged humor combine.</p>
<p>A cursory look at this band’s early press leaves little doubt that they know how to play the game, with one attention-seeking spectacle after another giving them all the scrutiny they need. Bodily fluids gush forth from the stage when they play, their manager is a tweed-clad fellow named Robert Rubbish, and they even gained note for a mundane <a href=""http://metro.co.uk/2013/04/10/top-10-most-provocative-responses-to-margaret-thatchers-death-3591399/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stunt</a> to mark the death of Margaret Thatcher. It speaks volumes for how exhausted the corpse of rock &amp; roll is that such antics can still prick the attention, but at least Fat White Family appear to be as genuinely unhealthy and depraved as their records and shows suggest. They’re even topical, with one of their best songs, <a href=""http://youtu.be/r95X2tXd8b0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Cream of the Young”</a>, taking an unflinching approach to pedophilia, just as their country is sinking in a mire of celebrity related scandal relating to the topic.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that <i>Champagne Holocaust</i> will be the album Fat White Family is best remembered for—this is the shambolic beginnings of something, full of directions tried and discarded and barely fleshed out. Lias owes a huge debt to Ben Wallers of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/887-country-teasers/"">Country Teasers</a> for both lyrical inspiration and execution, plus a dose of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">Mark E. Smith</a> and, perhaps more surprisingly, a soupçon of blue-eyed funk and the wistful psychedelic folk of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimmy_Disc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shimmy Disc</a> outfit <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongwater_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bongwater</a>. It’s distinctly backward-looking in outlook and sound, but that scarcely matters when the force of Lias’ songwriting obliterates the indie template they often take as their starting point. “Who Shot Lee Oswald?” amusingly imagines a series of culprits for the title’s crime, including Andy Warhol and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a>, and gloriously devolves into sonic and lyrical chaos that’s just on the right side of stupidity. “Was it a secret government within the American government?” Lias asks at one point.</p>
<p>The place Fat White Family are coming from is just as confusing as the stylistic turns this record takes. They’re part drug addled lunatics hell-bent on blocking out the world, part angry Situationist operatives looking to kick up a shitstorm of trouble as the world disintegrates around them. If contemporaries such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32265-sleaford-mods/"">Sleaford Mods</a> also find humor and anger in the wider state of things, Fat White Family are just as likely to turn everything inward and examine their own failings. “If my mind was clean I’d be fine,” is a key lyric on the raggedy “Borderline”, but instead, we get a distinctly unclean vision of life, with Lias at his best when depicting sordid sexual encounters. Most of those gain a grubby strength from the minutiae he picks up on—the “five sweaty fingers on my dashboard” in his paean to car fellatio, “Is It Raining In Your Mouth?”, being his greatest chant-along moment to date.</p>
<p>In some ways it’s fitting that <i>Champagne Holocaust</i> can’t hold together as a coherent piece, especially when the primary working mode of this band takes disarray as an important requisite to function. The back half is especially weak, leaning into cheery, jangly guitars that don’t have a natural place (“Bomb Disneyland”) and redundant Syd-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> pastiche (“Garden of the Numb”). This version of the record wisely adds one of their strongest moments, <a href=""http://youtu.be/JcmV0G3HWxk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Touch the Leather”</a>, as a final rallying call, with Lias again immersed in a pit of sexual degradation that appears to be the best reflection of his naturally soiled state of being. The video for the song—Lias, missing teeth, his face wrinkled beyond his years, mouthing words in slow motion while his brother moons the camera—illustrates the mix of low-level living and base humor this band has sunk into. It’s not pleasant, maybe not even relatable for many, but it works simply because it’s so vivid in its depiction of a life <span id=""docs-internal-guid-b94405f6-bbaf-93ab-bd5d-53d4a9c420bd""><span>permanently</span></span> on the cusp of falling apart.</p></div>"|19630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19630-fat-white-family-champagne-holocaust/|6.6|Nick Neyland

Narrow your parameters and you might find solutions you wouldn’t have if your choices were infinite. It’s why entire movements have been based on self-imposed restrictions: take the </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oulipo</a><span> group, whose </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Perec"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Georges Perec</a><span> wrote an entire </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Void"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">novel </a><span>without the letter e, or </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dogme95</a><span>, in which directors such as </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_von_Trier"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lars Von Trier</a><span> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9158-harmony-korine/"">Harmony Korine</a> adhered to rules about hand-held cameras and on-set sound.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It might seem odd to compare those contrivances to the simple act of making solo instrumental guitar music. After all, the form is not exactly unusual, having been around longer than jazz ensembles or rock bands. Still, to play guitar alone is to submit to restrictions—not only in the finite number of sounds you can make, but in what little innovation is still available. So much has been done and so many legends loom large—especially, for anyone picking strings now, the two-headed monster of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/""><span>John Fahey</span></a><span> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/280-derek-bailey/""><span>Derek Bailey</span></a><span>—that playing something new seems nearly impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">I’m not sure Tashi Dorji has made anything completely new yet, but the range of creative solutions he’s found while trying to avoid the well-worn paths of instrumental guitar music is thrilling. Raised in Bhutan and based in Asheville, N.C. since 2000, Dorji has made a handful of diverse releases in the past decade, mostly on cassette. He and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3807-six-organs-of-admittance/"">Six Organs of Admittance</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">’s Ben Chasny chose tracks from those (and some unreleased tapes) for his first, self-titled LP.</span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> There are only six pieces here, but each feels like its own planet. They occupy the same sonic universe but are different enough to suggest Dorji has traversed light years between each.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Dorji covers a lot of ground inside each piece. Often he’ll counter a dizzying cluster of high-speed plucks with subdued phrases and full stops, in the process echoing blues, classical, new age, and idiom-less free improv. As a result, “Improvisation II” feels like a baroque exercise and a spaced-out head rush, while “Still III” is both meditative and hyperactively impulsive. Dorji seems to cram everything he can think of into closer “Sunder”, whose ringing cycles have a hypnotic persistence, like an image you can’t get out of your head no matter how long you close your eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">It might sound like Dorji’s playing is so all over the place that it’s jarring—and it can be—but that’s also what makes it unified, because everything on </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Tashi Dorji </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">sounds like the tugging and jostling of a single brain. Each piece is a reactive internal monologue wherein previous pushes echo in later pulls. Follow all the darting notes and you can practically see Dorji’s neurons firing at each other, every one a point or counterpoint in an ongoing argument he’s having with himself.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Of course, not everyone likes to watch a fight, and Dorji’s string-wrangling will likely appeal most to those already inclined to wordless note-battles. From a distance, it might even look like his style is not that much of deviation from the patterns honed by the many storied players who preceded him. But sometimes when you zoom in close enough, you can find infinity inside the infinitesimal, and Dorji has managed to turn what could have merely been small variations into some pretty grand spaces.</span></p></div>"|19531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19531-tashi-dorji-tashi-dorji/|7.1|Marc Masters

Outside of iconic heavy classic rock or shiny mainstream metal, this doesn't mean the music is easier to listen to as a result—there's the collaborative art-drone of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>, as unlikely a crossover band as any, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a>'s blend of shoegaze guitar textures and screamo/black metal vocals. It's rare that a contemporary group remains entirely in the metal world and still manages to find an audience outside of it, but the vintage-doom players in Pallbearer have done just that. Their ascension started with their debut, 2012's excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16345-sorrow-and-extinction/""><i>Sorrow and Extinction</i></a>, and with the release of their brilliant second album,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/510-foundations-of-burden/"" target=""_blank""><i> Foundations of Burden</i></a>, it's easy to imagine them gaining even more popularity.</p>
<p>When the Arkansas quartet put out <i>Sorrow</i>, they had already built excitement in the metal underground based on a three-song 2010 demo; but for most people, the five-song, 49-minute LP—with its gorgeous guitar tones and sky-soaring vocals—was their first taste of the group. Pallbearer ended <i>Sorrow</i>'s thank you list with ""and, of course <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a>,"" which made perfect sense because they appeal to that diverse cross section of people who also thank Black Sabbath for their own personal reasons.</p>
<p>Two years later, they've returned with a collection that feels even more connected to the pure, unadulterated aspects of doom, and Pallbearer have transcended the need to thank anyone but themselves. The group were given a bigger budget from their label Profound Lore to record <i>Foundations</i>, and they did so with Billy Anderson, who also sat behind the controls for the classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"">Sleep</a> oeuvre and has recorded seminal works for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1943-high-on-fire/"">High on Fire</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"">Melvins</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2172-jawbreaker/"">Jawbreaker</a>, and others (including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3539-red-house-painters/"">Red House Painters</a>, who's early material had a sense of space that makes sense in this realm).</p>
<p>In an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/9453-pallbearer/"">interview</a> I did with Pallbearer co-founder/co-lyricist/bassist Joseph D. Rowland, he said Anderson told them he's never recorded a band that used so many guitar tracks—an element of Pallbearer's sound that explains the massiveness of <i>Foundations</i>, as well as how they saw  <i> Sorrow'</i>s successes as an opportunity to deepen and strengthen their craft. This is an ambitious record that doesn't feel at all over-worked or stale, and while <i>Sorrow and Extinction</i> holds up beautifully two years later, <i>Foundations</i> is the stronger collection to the point that <i>Sorrow </i>almost comes across as demos for this new material.</p>
<p>Though Pallbearer arrived fully formed, vocalist/guitarist Brett Campbell's stirring voice was a little pitchy live, suggesting that he was sometimes straining beyond his abilities. When I reviewed <i>Sorrow</i>, I said that ""Campbell has been described as a young Ozzy Osbourne, and that influence is certainly there, but imagine if a young Ozzy had the ability to transform into Geddy Lee."" His singing on <i>Foundations</i> has more ease, soul, and grit, and he sounds steadier, smoother, and more assured. It helps, too, that bassist Rowland and guitarist Devin Holt offer their own vocals on three tracks, adding details, depth, and complexity to the melodies. When they join Campbell, you get the sense of a madrigal, with overlapping harmonies that will give you goosebumps. You get a taste of it right out of the gate on the 10-minute opener, ""Worlds Apart"", a song that features cascading three-part vocals powering upward between layered guitars that crunch at the same time as they soothe. On ""The Ghost I Used to Be"", Rowland's screamed vocals mix with Campbell's more honeyed voice, creating a raw, almost punk dynamic for Pallbearer that didn't exist previously.</p>
<p>There's dense, regal play all over <i>Foundations</i>: guitars collide, a Rhodes adds subtle details in the distance. There are new textures, bigger tempo shifts, and dynamic turns. It's a great headphone record, but you'll want to be listening to these songs in a larger room where you can move around and make contact. Where <i>Sorrow</i> often felt like a great solitary album—especially in its focus on death and mortality—<i>Foundations</i> is clearly built for larger communal spaces, as even the quiet moments are massive. Pallbearer are patient, and the textures they build feel painterly (kudos to Anderson, many times over). There are moments where things drop out, like on ""Watcher in the Dark"", where you get some low-level fuzz accompanied by Mark Lierly's nimble drumming (he's a more agile, technical player than original drummer Chuck Schaaf). When the rest of the instruments return at full volume, it's physically impossible not to want to move. In the same song, there's a limber guitar solo over gentle piano parts; elsewhere, synthesizers hum, bells chime, the band showcases a newfound swagger to go with the psychedelia and '70s prog.</p>
<p>The music's catchy, too, and full of hooks. Pallbearer are proud fans of rock groups like Boston and Rainbow, and these songs, while long, go down easy. As Rowland told me, ""[Our songs] are all almost exactly three times the length of a standard pop song, almost to the second, so I decided that that's our version of writing pop songs."" With the twinkling three-minute ""Ashes"", you actually get to hear them doing doom-as-dusky ambient pop.</p>
<p>Rowland has talked about how <i>Sorrow</i> was focused on a loved one's death, and that the subject matter of <i>Foundations</i> is more varied; even so, these songs deal in ashes, formless voids, feasting on blood, time crushing things, and in general, loss. Still, it's never a bummer. In ""Worlds Apart"", Campbell sings ""Where lays our heart of hearts defined/ My darkness and your light, still yet remain entwined."" This mixture of light and dark seems to be the crux of Pallbearer, a group who make sadness seem uplifting, darkness seem bright, and songs about mortality seem life-giving. The final words of the album are: ""We're always shifting/ And always becoming."" The sentiment comes during the stampeding moments of the heady, muscular ""Vanished"", and that endless becoming is fitting on both an emotional and conceptual level. <i>Foundations</i> finds a band firing on all cylinders, and surpassing what seemed like a watermark for the genre. As obsessed as Pallbearer is with endings, the music here is timeless.</p></div>"|19570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19570-pallbearer-foundations-of-burden/|8.6|Brandon Stosuy

Not because people kept shouting for rewinds, but I had the opening slot and wanted to begin my set with the song, which seemed like it would be perfect for creating a sense of atmosphere, given its dusky, slow-burning qualities. I had forgotten, however, that it takes time for the few people who actually arrive by midnight to get through coat check, make their way up the stairs, and so on, so I just kept on playing it until the first clubbers finally walked in the room, feeling satisfied that my careful attention to scene-setting hadn't gone to waste.</p>
<p>I mention this anecdote only because <i>In the Wild</i>, Drew Lustman's fourth LP under the alias, follows a surprisingly similar principle. Breaking all the established rules of album pacing, it moves in fits and starts, a tangled succession of intros, interludes, and outros, with the occasional song thrown into the mix. It's perpetually on the edge of getting started—except when it isn't, and then it's winding down just halfway through. Five of its 17 tracks are less than two minutes long, and even some of its longer cuts feel like extended interludes.</p>
<p>""Aquí, Port Lligat"" opens the album with 93 seconds of gorgeous, halting ambience that glows like the dawn and rolls like the tide—a fitting tribute to the coastal Catalan village it's named for. ""New Haven"" is immediately off and running, careening along at 150 beats per minute as the detuned notes of a prepared piano scatter like pebbles; in the background, there's a doo-wop group warming up on a treadmill, huffing and out of breath. But the 30 seconds of beatless harmonium wheeze that follows, ""Uptight"", pulls the rug out, and the next track, ""Do Me"", restores the music's pulse without necessarily suggesting much in the way of forward motion. ""Do me, do me, do me, do me, do me, huh,"" intones a digitally processed voice, incessantly, over chugging breakbeats, glistening keys, and wisps of delay. As many times as I listen to it, I can't quite figure out where it's trying to go or what it's trying to do, although that's hardly a complaint; druggy and fumbling, it offers a more accurate representation of post-club eros than any attempt at overt sexiness.</p>
<p>The rest of the album proceeds in similarly scattered fashion. After ""Greater Antilles Pt. 1""—a minute of shuffling rumble followed by 30 seconds of fading drones—""Nine"" pits pitched-down strings against flickering bells and a woman's voice whispering something like ""Listen""; it comes off like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> record that's greased up in some kind of unidentifiable gunk, and although it's one of the album's longer songs, it still feels like a sketch. The same could be said of ""In the Shit"", which moves from cosmic arpeggios into 150-BPM breakbeats and weird, dissonant synthesizers that sound lifted from 1960s IRCAM tapes; the beat fades out before the song hits the halfway mark, leaving a long denouement of mirage-like shimmer.</p>
<p>There are few obvious singles, although that's not to say there's not plenty here that adventurous DJs might put to good use. ""Frontin'"" sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"">DJ Rashad</a> recording for Hamburg's <a href=""http://www.smallville-records.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smallville</a> label, drizzling looped vocals (""We on some bullshit"") and pastoral piano over chopped-up congas; it moves like a plastic bag in an updraft. ""Dos Gardenias"" is another house-tempo bump-and-grinder, even if it begins with strummed acoustic guitars that might be outtakes from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>' <i>The Burning World</i>. And just before the album ends, ""Danger"" plunges into the 2-steppy breakbeats of FaltyDL's early years with great gusto; a club DJ could easily spin it alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"">Disclosure</a> (and make Disclosure look meek and wan in comparison).</p>
<p>Some listeners will undoubtedly find <i>In the Wild</i>'s diffuse qualities frustrating—particularly after last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17556-hardcourage/""><i>Hardcourage</i></a> proved Lustman's abilities to target sleek, emotive music directly towards the center of the dance floor. <i>Hardcourage</i> was his most streamlined, professional-sounding work to date, right down to the Ed Macfarlane guest vocal; it brimmed with potential hits. It would be all too easy to imagine him basically remaking that album, but <i>In the Wild</i> isn't trying to be that kind of record, and it benefits from its eccentricities. The sounds themselves—sumptuously tarnished samples and breakbeats worn smooth as river rocks—are their own reward, even when they don't do what you expect them to.</p>
<p>If Lustman were following the smart money, he'd craft an album full of songs that could double as festival-roster calling cards, but instead he's thrown caution to the wind and come up with something much more interesting. Who knows, maybe his next album will be wall-to-wall bangers, and that might even be a welcome thing. But there's a pleasure in the odd, quiet, open spaces that <i>In the Wild</i> suggests, in which pivoting gobos draw lonely beams across open floor, and dry ice wafts uninterrupted by moving bodies. Zones without people, main rooms without dancers—the album feels like an answer to the old adage about a tree falling in a forest unattended, and as such, <i>In the Wild</i> is brimming with imaginative potential.</p></div>"|19611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19611-falty-dl-in-the-wild/|7.0|Philip Sherburne

If you’re an American who consumed rock music via mainstream channels during the 1990s, there were certain UK acts you’d find in the back pages of a mainstream mag’s review section, late at night on MTV, or wedged into alt-rock playlists; they may have been on major labels and were not the least bit compelling or innovative, but they sure <i>seemed</i> foreign and exotic. Such specific revivalism can seem refreshing considering the relative lack of competition in this field, but there’s an unintentional truth in advertising with this London quartet's debut: put together, “Childhood Lacuna” loosely translates to “a nostalgic void.”</p>
<p>Though very much indebted to their national iterations of jangly, light heavyweight indie, Childhood show enough range to make it clear they formed in college during the 2010s. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14385-blue-velvet/"">“Blue Velvet”</a> suggests they’ve unconsciously internalized deep cuts from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"">Wavves</a>’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14415-king-of-the-beach"">King of the Beach</a></i>; before the tidal rise of the chorus, its similarity to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk5liPTzuKc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Baby Say Goodbye” </a>is so extreme and specific that it almost <i>has</i> to be unintentional. “As I Am” traces the stately guitar infrastructure of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate"">Real Estate</a> while adding a bit more curve and verve (as well as Curve and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4475-the-verve/"">the Verve</a> in their earlier, lighter shoegaze iterations). Throw in a song called “Chiliad”, and they’ve put together one hell of a turn-of-the-decade time capsule.</p>
<p>But given the proper template, Childhood know how to put a song together<span>—</span>most often comprised of a soft-focus verse that sharpens right in time for the chorus, with the notable exception of “Right Beneath Me”, wherein Childhood melt right along with Ben Romans-Hopcraft’s falsetto, instigating a chocolate fountain of viscous sweetness. Such moments are abetted by the production of Dan Carey, known for the sync-friendly sheen he recently gave to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes"">Bat For Lashes</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift"">Chairlift</a>. Childhood are stylish, but they’re not fashionistas<span>—this is</span> a cushy and comforting recording, more akin to a worn sweater than a crisp, club-ready button-down. That element has a certain charm, though Childhood could stand for something more form-fitting, as the second half of <i>Lacuna</i> retreats into a mid-fi, reverbed shimmer and fade.</p>
<p>Granted, Childhood are more tuneful than the scores of other bands doing something similar. But their myriad reference points has the effect of making you think about the few bands they <i>don’t</i> emulate<span>—</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"">Oasis</a>, <i>Urban Hymns-</i>era Verve, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur"">Blur</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12208-the-stone-roses"">the Stone Roses</a>, and the bands that appealed to <i>millions</i> due to the belief in their own greatness or songs that truly wanted to be adored. Sure, such goals are anathema for true indie types, and the first line on<i> Lacuna</i> is a sheepish, “We said way too much”, so fittingly, they don't say much else at all for the duration of <i>Lacuna. </i>When the chorus of ""As I Am"" boasts, “So tell me what you wanna do/ And take me as I am,” Childhood sound defensive rather than bold, as they're too low-key to be issuing ultimatums.</p>
<p>It’s coincidental that the timing of Childhood and Richard Linklater’s <i>Boyhood</i> should overlap somewhat<span>—</span>they both deal with similar themes in their dialogue, including miscommunication between the sexes, the bittersweetness of youth and home, watching television. Likewise, the ambition is in the comprehensiveness, as there isn’t a whole lot of major action while it’s happening. But with <i>Boyhood</i>, you grow invested in the characters as they evolve over 12 years; you can enjoy the flow of <i>Lacuna</i> just as much, but in the 11 songs here, you just wish there was some character to begin with.</p></div>"|19584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19584-childhood-lacuna/|6.1|Ian Cohen

The self-produced, mostly industrial record not only saw him wailing motivational sermons to himself and listeners, it also highlighted what had been a recurrent source of adulation for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a>—that is, exploratory rap production driven home by an exceptional level of vocal conviction. But while West's experimentation was met with surprise, B L A C K I E has been making such range in soundscapes a calling card for his entire career; his 2012-released standout <i>GEN</i> wielded similar subject matter, but over mostly acoustic production assisted by keys, horns, and guitar riffs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When I interviewed B L A C K I E last year, he told me that he’d recorded <i>Fuck The False</i> in one take, fueled by Red Bull and whiskey, and that his new project would be mostly jazz-based. The premise was a head-scratcher, but B L A C K I E’s career has consistently rested on the outskirts of rap. On his latest album, <i>Imagine Your Self in a Free and Natural World, </i>he’s barely clinging onto the genre.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With two of the album’s three tracks eclipsing the sixteen-minute mark, B L A C K I E’s penchant for storytelling and intense imagery are at center stage. “Wings Blocking Out the Sun” and “Forest of Ex-Lovers” materialize piece-by-piece with scene-building electric bass riffs that abruptly crash into B L A C K I E’s commanding vocals. The latter begins with eerie screeches, placing him in a state of vulnerability where he faces his fears head-on and talks emptily to shadows. In the former, a vulture rises up and “Turns itself into a fist” in what feels like a post-apocalyptic dystopia. </p>
<p class=""p1"">B L A C K I E’s layering of saxophone over bass in <i>Imagine Your Self in a Free and Natural World</i><i> </i>adds to the uncanny atmosphere. The album’s instrumentation positions it more as an avant-garde, free-jazz effort in the line of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12521-herbie-hancock/"">Herbie Hancock</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/"">Sun Ra</a> than the punk-rap that's come to be expected of B L A C K I E. Still, reference points be damned, the album doesn’t quite sound like anything else. On “Cry, Pig!”, the climb in B L A C K I E’s emotion conveys an effective message of frustration, and such catharsis is what makes his music so multi-dimensional.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On <i>Imagine Your Self in a Free and Natural World, </i>B L A C K I E chooses to strip away an already minimal formula for music-making, showcasing his near-decade run of taking noise-rap to unseen levels of experimentation. Unfortunately, the striking, candid lyricism that made <i>GEN</i> and <i>Fuck the False </i>such solid pieces of work is missing as a result. Still, <i>Imagine Your Self in a Free and Natural World </i>showcases a writing approach that models itself more like abstract poetry than conventional verses, combining jazz with rap in a way that hasn’t been as exciting since the acid-jazz wave in the early '90s. The combo hasn't been as forceful as it is here, too.</p></div>"|19698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19698-b-l-a-c-k-i-e-imagine-yourself-in-a-free-and-natural-world/|7.3|Lawrence Burney

It’s an odd, almost nonsensical line, at least until she expounds on the idea grimly: “But you’ll be in the dirt…You'll be the dirt.” Wagner doesn’t write songs; instead, she constructs memento mori. Death creeps through this album just as it crept through her 2012 self-titled debut, too matter-of-fact to be sinister but too inescapable to be exactly comforting. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16427-mirel-wagner/"">Mirel Wagner</a></i> was a fine introduction to an artist whose lyrics were lushly gothic and whose music sounded like it was fading either into or out of pitch silence. She sang in a whisper somewhere between intimate and conspiratorial, and punctuated her lyrics with spectral acoustic strums and plucks. The mid-fi production lent that album the air of a recently unearthed artifact not yet studied or understood.</p>
<p>For <i>When the Cellar Children See the Light of Day</i>, Wagner sequestered herself in a remote cabin on the Hailuoto peninsula in northern Finland, where she spent time penning these tunes. Afterwards, she booked time at an actual studio with an actual producer—namely, Sasu Ripatti under his Vladislav Delay alias, better known for dance music than for folk. He treats the acoustic elements in similar fashion, isolating each syllable, plunk, and strum as a distinct element. Wagner’s songs remain skeletal—still just bone and flaking flesh—but the sound is more polished, crisper and starker and at times even slick. A few other instruments wander into the arrangements, including an understated electric guitar on “The Dirt”. A bowed cello lurks behind trees on “Ellipsis”, appearing again with an eerie piano to stalk closer “Goodnight”. These instruments (courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/131-craig-armstrong/"">Craig Armstrong</a>) are never quite intrusive; they’re more like decorative baubles, neither distracting nor especially necessary.</p>
<p>One consequence of the sharper sound on <i>Cellar</i> is a new brightness in Wagner’s voice, which projects more expressive texture on these songs. She no longer sounds like the scout just returned to report on the afterlife. When she sings in the voice of an abandoned baby on “Oak Tree”, her tone is perhaps too practiced for such a bleak predicament. On the other hand, the disparity between Wagner’s subject matter and her delivery often proves rewarding, deepening a mood and complicating an idea. Opener “1 2 3 4” pairs a jumprope countoff with grisly imagery, rhyming “four” with “What’s underneath the floor?” She seems to savor not just the offputting rot of a line like “big fat belly birthing out flies”, but the syllables themselves: those perverse b’s, that deafening long i sound at the end. Best may be the halting class dissection “In My Father’s House”, on which she describes the hierarchies of servants and answers herself with a knowing hum. It’s perhaps the one song here that completely rethinks her approach, that assembles the musical elements in a new way, and it casts a strong spell. Spoiler alert: Everybody—the maids, chefs, butlers, masters, and children—dies in the end, and so do you.</p></div>"|19518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19518-mirel-wagner-when-the-cellar-children-see-the-light-of-day/|7.2|Stephen Deusner

Every song she's released so far, even the four from her self-released debut EP from 2012, has been accompanied by its own video. What these may lack in storyboarding, set design, or anything else, really—""Hide"" just features her hypnotically stroking an anthurium that adorns her nude midsection—more than make up for in their ability to draw you close, hold you rapt and keep you wondering just who, exactly, this character called twigs might be. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The British musician and performer born Tahliah Barnett got her start in the pop-industrial complex as a backup dancer in music videos, a career that led, for a spell, to a strange kind of almost-fame—you walk around and you get recognized, but not for being you, necessarily, just for being that girl from the video. And so, she has said, you learn to lie: ""No, that's not me. No, I get that a lot."" She addresses this situation on her debut album, <i>LP1</i>, with the song ""Video Girl"". It's actually one of the album's most straightforward songs, but its chorus is unequivocal in its equivocations: ""Is she the girl that's from the video?/ You lie and you lie and you lie.""  And all that artifice, in turn, is a way of making truth out of the lie. Because what is her music, what are her videos, if not an elaborate way of saying, ""No, I'm not that girl from the video. <i>This</i> is who I am""?</p>
<p class=""p1"">She hides in plain sight on the cover of <i>LP1</i>, wearing an expression that's—what? Coy? Distant? What exactly is going on there, beneath those strands of just-so curlicue and that weird, plastic sheen across one slick cheek? And that splash of red, what is that supposed to be—a blush, a bruise, a birthmark? Is she a teenybopper post-popped bubblegum, a cartoon character post-exploding cigar? The image expands upon the subtle surrealism of last year's <i>EP2</i> cover, where her neck was almost imperceptibly elongated, and the more aggressive post-processing of her ""Water Me"" video, in which her eyes are enlarged, anime-style, until they threaten to pop like a <a href=""http://www.schylling.com/p/panic-pete-squeeze-toy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Panic Pete Squeeze Toy</a>. These tweaks are crucial to twigs' eerie, post-humanist, Uncanny Valley-girl aesthetic.</p>
<p class=""p1"">More than anything else, the image reminds me of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>'s Alexander McQueen-designed <i>Homogenic </i>cover, in which the Icelandic singer hovered in the middle distance between larger-than-life pop icon and superflat fantasy gloss like a digital scan of a wax figure. Listening to <i>LP1</i>, it's immediately clear that twigs is aiming for similar heights—and easily capable of scaling them. Quiet as it may be, this is a huge album, a monumental debut. On a formal level, it takes the kinds of risks that few pop artists, and few ""experimental"" artists, for that matter, are willing to take these days. As far as the making of the artist known as FKA twigs goes, it gives us a sense of who she is without shedding any of the mystique she has developed so far.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Building on her co-produced debut EP with Tic and her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca"">Arca</a>-produced <i>EP2</i>, the sound throughout is a crystalline jumble of splinters and shards, of stuttering drum machines cutting against arrhythmic clatter—metronomes winding down, car alarms bleating dully into the night. Her voice, the most awe-inspiring instrument on the album, flits between Auto-Tuned artifice and raw carnality. As an acrobat, she's a natural, but she's not afraid to lean on a little digital enhancement. One minute it's a flash-frozen sigh; the next, it's a melon-balled dollop of flesh. As futuristic as her music is, no single technology dominates. Elastic digital effects brush up against 808s, and icy synth stabs share space with acoustic bass. The common denominator is the crackling sense of dread that persists when the notes go silent and the beat drops out, which is often. The overall effect is that of R&amp;B that has been run through some kind of matter-transporting beam and put together wrong on the other end, full of glitches and hard, jutting artifacts.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The most obvious reference points, aside from the spectrum of breathy, synth-heavy R&amp;B that stretches from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5068-ciara/"">Ciara</a> through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/""><i>Beyoncé</i></a>, are first-gen trip-hop acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4285-tricky/"">Tricky</a>, with their charcoal-streaked affect and sumptuous sense of texture. There are also clear links to contemporary UK artists working the margins between R&amp;B and electronic music, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"">James Blake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"">the xx</a>, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31081-sophie/"">Sophie</a>, he of the deconstructed Saturday-morning rave choons. Her own vocal style, or at least her stratospheric range, evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"">Kate Bush</a> and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/83-tori-amos/"">Tori Amos</a>. More provocative, though, is the way she and her producers wrangle a whole host of unlikely references into the mix: ""Two Weeks"" features blushing chords reminiscent of late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a> and a junkyard guitar lead straight out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a>' <i>Rain Dogs. </i>Even more incongruously, ""Two Weeks"" cribs a fleeting riff from Air Supply's ""All Out of Love."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">At the same time, it's a testament to the strength of her vision that the album is as cohesive as it is, despite having so many producers involved, including Arca, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32338-devonte-hynes/"">Devonté Hynes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a>, and Grammy-winning journeyman Emile Haynie (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14380-recovery/""><i>Recovery</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a>'s ""Born to Die"" and ""Blue Jeans,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west"">Kanye West</a>'s ""Runaway""). <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31502-sampha/"">Sampha</a> helps out on the brittle ""Numbers,"" a Portishead-gone-footwork number that serves as the album's energetic peak, and, perhaps most surprisingly, Paul Epworth (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"">Adele</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3529-the-rapture/"">the Rapture</a>) is responsible for ""Pendulum,"" the album's literal and emotional centerpiece. </p>
<p class=""p1"">FKA twigs is not a masterful lyricist, at least not yet; some of her couplets feel clunky, like she's grasping in the dark for rhymes and coming up with the objects closest to hand (""If the flame gets blown out and you shine/ I will know that you cannot be mine""). But when she zeroes in on the essence of a thing, she hits hard. The brazen ""Two Weeks"" features lines as vivid as red welts: ""Higher than a motherfucker"", ""I can fuck you better than her."" (The Weeknd only <i>wishes</i> he could make depravity sound so soul-destroyingly desperate.) On top of that, there's a whole thing about pulling out teeth that tips the song into some kind of freaky David Cronenberg territory, making her drugged-up and tied-down fantasies all the more tantalizingly surreal. </p>
<p class=""p1"">If ""Two Weeks"" represents the album's sensual core, ""Pendulum"" is the epicenter of the record's underlying sense of heartbreak, with its glum mantra, ""So lonely trying to be yours."" Lyrically, the song finds twigs at her most plainspoken—it's a long way off from last year's similarly devastating, but far more cryptic, ""Water Me""—so it feels significant that it's one of the album's most sonically out-there songs, with a rhythm built out of what sounds like a roulette wheel run amok and its wash of synthesizers like a sky full of fireflies in death spirals. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Early in the song, she sings, ""Lately I'm not so present now,"" and the line goes straight to the crux of FKA twigs' whole identity. After all, this is an artist whose name itself suggests a fundamental displacement. Spelled out, it's ""Formerly Known As twigs,"" (no) thanks to the lawyers of some other artist named Twigs. (Barnett earned her nickname from her habit of cracking her joints like dried sticks; is it any wonder her beats are so brittle?) That ""FKA"" is a way of masking the bigger question mark. Formerly known as, sure. But who is she now? <i>Are you that girl from the video</i>? ""I can't recognize me,"" she sings at the close of ""Video Girl"", but for the rest of us, with <i>LP1</i>, she's zooming into vivid focus, and it's impossible to look away.</p></div>"|19590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19590-twigs-lp1/|8.8|Philip Sherburne

Never mind that, if one were to squint real hard, the North Carolina producer’s shimmering, saccharine-sweet new album could be seen as an antidote to the aggressive, toxically masculine culture that’s pervaded mainstream American dance culture over the last few years—a culture whose fuck-it sense of hedonism <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56151-virginia-teenager-dies-following-mad-decent-block-party/"">has recently resulted in</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55759-man-dies-at-electric-forest-festival/"">fatal consequences</a>, even as its corporate benefactors continue to <a href=""https://twitter.com/kingkroba/status/496740071358619649"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cynically bleed its participants dry</a>. Much more than a corrective gesture, the specific mix of sounds on <i>Worlds</i>—part synthy indie-pop, part twinkling bedroom-beatmaker fare, part festival-ready electro—comes at an excellent time. Finding a middle ground between the synthetic surge of big-tent dance music and the tart melodic tendencies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/"">Passion Pit</a>, Robinson’s debut album drives home the reality that mainstream electronic music carries a certain sensitivity found in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxxstCcJlsc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">chart-topping smashes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">zeitgeist-capturing Ultra Fest main-stagers</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30917-flume/"">sneakily successful soft-beat auteurs</a> alike.</p>
<p>Viewed through this lens, the mess of contradictions that Robinson seemingly embodies—a one-time bassface junkie who loaded <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/porter-robinson/porter-robinson-bbc-radio-1-2-hour-essential-mix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his recent BBC Essential Mix</a> with cloying indie fare, a dance superstar who’s <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2014/07/31/porter-robinson-worlds-feature-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">expressed disgust regarding his own Las Vegas residency while pooh-poohing “DIY Brooklyn” and “future bass” in the same breath</a>—untangles itself. And anyway, the expansive, wistful grandeur of <i>Worlds</i> is a sound that Robinson’s slowly built towards over the last few years. A practical <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a> protegé raised, like many internet denizens, on a diet of video games and the nerdier areas of Japanese culture, Robinson’s transformation into a sky-gazing sentimentalist began not with his Beatport-crashing 2011 debut EP <i>Spitfire</i>, but the following year’s “Language”, a swooning single that packed shoegaze’s heady throb, American dubstep’s techy crunch, and the wistfulness of trance into six minutes-plus of bliss that slightly resembled <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP18BqkFuSE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">if Tiësto had remixed the Honeydrips’ “Fall From a Height” instead of the Field</a>.</p>
<p>If “Language” toyed with the idea of pushing American dance music trends into a more blissed-out direction, <i>Worlds</i> goes whole-hog, to the point that when buzzsaw synths, chintzy strings, and nasty basslines rear their heads near the album’s end on “Fellow Feeling”, their presence is garish and unwelcome. If we’re being real, it’s hard to justify calling most of <i>Worlds</i> “dance music,” as this is electro-pop plain and simple, with its guest vocalists—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3933-stars/"">Stars</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4780-amy-millan/"">Amy Millan</a>, Owl City affiliate Breanne Duren, Canadian indie-pop duo Imaginary Cities, Sean Caskey of Australian festival-poppers Last Dinosaurs—embodying that genre’s sensibilities. Most surprisingly, Robinson himself occasionally and quite effectively takes lead vocal duties, especially on “Sad Machine”, which finds his high-range voice dueting with a Vocaloid, a digital audio tool that replicates the human voice, over a mid-tempo beat and starry-eyed melodic structure.</p>
<p>”Sad Machine” is one of a few tracks on <i>Worlds</i> that evoke, unintentionally or not, Passion Pit’s high-wire synth-pop fantasias. But above all else, the equally enduring influence of M83’s emotive electro looms over this album’s highlights. “Sea of Voices” stretches out elided vocals and fizzling ambience to an impossibly gorgeous zenith, before massive drums crash through the foreground in a manner not unlike “My Tears Are Becoming a Sea”, from M83’s still-unbeatable 2011 opus <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/""><i>Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming</i></a>; on “Hear the Bells”, a similar trick is played to equally ecstatic effect, the processing on Imaginary Cities’ vocals serving as a minor and unnecessary distraction from the rippling electronics and anthemic synth that gives the song a healthy, balanced dose of rocket fuel. Together, “Hear the Bells” and “Sea of Voices” make for two of the most transportive electro-pop singles of this year, a pair of unabashedly huge songs that, when caught in the right light, carry the potential to strike a personal chord for anyone who’s ever felt alive while looking at a city skyline at night.</p>
<p>The main drawback to <i>Worlds</i>’ sound, an impressionistic approach to mass-appeal fare, is that anyone with their ear to the (festival) ground might find these sounds to be relatively old-hat—after all, Passion Pit’s suffered a legion of imitators in their wake, and “Midnight City” has proved one of the most influential songs of the decade when it comes to guiding the tastes of major-label-signed, small-font-Coachella-poster acts. So no one’s going to refer to <i>Worlds</i> as “innovative”, and the sonic shift Robinson’s made here is as industry-canny as it is surprising.

Plenty of producers try to imitate the desaturated avant-techno of <i>Hazyville</i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14375-splazsh/""><i>Splazsh</i></a>'s dadaist dancefloor, but you can hear Actress in Werkdiscs mostly because the essence of Darren Cunningham's sound is pure lightning in a bottle—it's a creative path designed to take you to the places he uncovers. One kindred spirit to land on Werkdiscs is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31051-moire/"">Moiré</a>, an essentially anonymous Londoner.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The actual similarities Moiré shares with Actress are surface level, though. When the producer debuted in early 2013 with his <i>Never Sleep</i> EP, autonomic, skeletal tracks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14869-lose-it/""><span class=""s1"">""Lose It""</span></a> used the same gassy basslines and mindless propulsion of <i>Splazsh</i>'s ""Lost""; by the time Moiré's <i>Rolx</i> EP arrived three months later, he'd already began to <span class=""s1"">inch towards</span> a more discernible identity. And those changes—no matter how rudimentary or superficial—have served him well. Because once you strip away his tunes' decaying proto-futurisms, the mechanics underneath reveal a producer working to restore function to Actress' decidedly dysfunctional strain of club music.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Shelter</i>, Moiré's first full-length, arrives 18 months into his career, and it couldn't be more timely. The record's eight productions are lean and effective in ways that most music currently inhabiting this scene can't or won't aspire to. Where Brooklyn's <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/white.material.records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">White Material Records</a> pushes dirty hardware house and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1433-jimmy-edgar/"">Jimmy Edgar</a>'s <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ULTRAMAJIC"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ultramajic</a> label treats Detroit techno like a sex toy, <i>Shelter</i> boils its run-in-the-red low end and hissing hi-hats until you can see yourself in their vacuum-sealed sheen. Chunky tech-house cuts like ""Dali House"" sound cold and antiseptic, but there's a slyly lascivious nature to the way Moiré buffs over his quicksilver synths with a gummy bassline. Bones' vocal turn—a deep, drawling tone not unlike of-the-moment house producer Galcher Lustwerk—only adds to the music's dark sexuality, sounding like unrequited come ons reflected off sheet metal. <i>Shelter</i>'s penultimate tune, ""Rings (feat. Charlie Tappin)"", treads similar territory, though its clinical milieu is more content to sit back and entice you with throbbing energy and ghostly wiles.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The remaining instrumental productions go further towards establishing Moiré's own place in the techno landscape. These tracks oscillate between affecting the styles of Ostgut Ton-with-charisma (""Attitude"" and ""No Gravity"") and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27648-omar-s/"">Omar-S</a>-imitating-M.C. Escher (""Infinity Shadow"" and ""Stars""), and always with a generously rigid UK ethos. At nearly eight and a half minutes, ""Elite / Hands On"" uses its ample space to blend <i>Shelter</i>'s predominate mentalities, collaging workmanlike grooves and heady ornamental indulgence with an impromptu precision. The resulting song isn't the brightest moment of the tracklist, though it manages to show how Moiré can simultaneously and confidently operate on a few different wavelengths.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Dialing down his avant tendencies has given Moiré a fresh perspective and helped tame his music, for better or worse. There are few <i>Hazyville</i> remnants other than slightly askew four-on-the-floors and the odd trampled vocal clip. As such, <i>Shelter</i> suffers at times from a subconscious dedication to balance and restraint—it's ""No Gravity""'s unwieldy sub frequencies and the cacophonous stomp of ""Stars"" that disseminate the producer's personality, not the rote arpeggiations that color ""Mr. Figure"" with listless monochrome. But these few missteps don't tarnish <i>Shelter</i>'s stainless-steel exterior.</p></div>"|19597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19597-moire-shelter/|7.6|Patric Fallon

He was the lapsed paladin writing woolly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Bruce Springsteen</a> homages along mana-crazed warlock Spencer Krug in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"">Wolf Parade</a>, a band whose contributions to the halcyon days of '00s indie rock are now rather underrated; his work in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5280-handsome-furs/"">Handsome Furs</a> with ex-wife Alexei Perry hung on the implied sexual tension between his chugging riffs and her icy, frenzied synth lines; and as the co-leader of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30530-divine-fits/"">Divine Fits</a>, he pitted his raw, heart-on-sleeve growl against Britt Daniel’s cooler, detached yelp, and ended up stealing the album’s best moments. Given that rich collaborative history, Boeckner’s first EP with his new band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32434-operators/"">Operators</a>, makes for a slightly disconcerting listen: for the first time in a long time, he’s alone at the front, a lead voice who’s spent his career defining himself against the voices of others. Based on the short and tidy <i>EP1</i>, Boeckner isn’t going to dramatically change the formula that’s won him fans and critical acclaim now that he’s the only one steering the ship. Its five songs are an extension of the gruff, melody-driven rock he’s been making for a decade, granted an electronic bent and license to hit the dancefloor.</p>
<p>Operators’ sound is clearly derived from a long-running line of smart, populist bands that blurred the boundaries between electronic and rock music: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a>’s mechanical precision and sturdy rhythms, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"">Depeche Mode</a>’s ambitious, dramatic stadium goth, and the ragged, crate-digging electro of the <a href=""http://dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a> label’s early period. These influences have always been present in Boeckner’s music—Handsome Furs was synth-pop, just set in an alternate timeline where the Soviet Union became the dominant world power, and Wolf Parade deployed vintage synths with wild-eyed glee—but they’ve never been as explicitly rendered as they are on <i>EP1</i>. The EP’s sprawling penultimate track, “Ancient”, is a good example: Boeckner is backed up by synths that misfire and slowly rise before cresting and plummeting—it’s a drop, real and earned—into a filthy, swaggering little groove. It’s a show of good faith on Boeckner’s part: it’s one thing to pay lip service to the idea of bridging contemporary rock and dance music, and quite another to actually get people moving. He seems honestly invested in the concept. There’s a welcome physicality to the music, too, helped along by the reliable contributions of Divine Fits drummer Sam Brown and keyboardist Devojka. These songs gobble up space and hit hard.</p>
<p>The qualities that help <i>EP1</i> hang alongside Boeckner's other, more prominent work are its unabashed sincerity and total investment in the idea of relevant, visceral rock music. Perhaps the EP's heart-on-sleeve pursuit of greatness isn't a huge surprise, given the band's creative core—we're talking about a guy whose finest moments are ripping, raw songs called ""This Heart's on Fire"" and ""My Love Is Real""—but either way, it's endearing. Rather than feeling born out of boredom or trend chasing, <i>EP1</i> radiates a reverence for its major influences, and a real excitement in its brightest, loudest moments. When the lurching, buzzing ""Book of Love"" splits open with a minute left and births a gorgeous, spiraling keyboard melody, you can almost see the band grinning and launching into their parts with renewed vigor; the same feeling is generated when lead single ""True"" first falls into its lockstep groove, or when the band kicks out the jams on the aforementioned ""Ancient"". Their joy is infectious, and it helps paper over some of the EP's cheesier moments. The repeated question ""Who put the ancient code in your bones?"" on ""Ancient"" might be the goofiest lyrical query this side of ""Are we human or are we dancer,"" but it's easier to forgive when it's delivered with energy and enthusiasm. That's what makes this first effort from Operators a worthwhile exercise: it's a chance to hear a veteran like Boeckner taking mild risks and having fun.</p></div>"|19708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19708-operators-ep1/|6.8|Jamieson Cox

No record by a major artist on a major label is so puzzling and so contradictory—it’s simultaneously dismissed out of hand and written off as a joke and cited as both important and hugely influential. Where you fall on that spectrum has a lot to do with how receptive you are to the idea of noise music in general. While there was music before <i>MMM</i> that was just as harsh and intense (parts of John Cage’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifxkwa8X1IE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cartridge Music</a>” come to mind), Reed’s album was the first to re-imagine noise for the post-acid-rock era.</p>
<p>Pure noise had previously been a classical phenomena, the logical endpoint of the dissonance introduced early in the century by modern composers like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Schoenberg</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Webern"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Webern</a> (and in fact Reed had originally hoped <i>MMM</i> would come out on a classical label) combined with the tinkering of musique concrète. In the late 1960s, the idea that extreme distortion, static, and feedback could be a part of popular song changed the way people understood noise, turned it from exclusively the realm of “art music” into something that could be appreciated more viscerally—a pop intensifier.</p>
<p>So the context of <i>Metal Machine Music</i> is what made it so revolutionary (or repulsive): listeners found it in the racks next to the rock’n’roll records, a 2xLP “electronic instrumental composition” by the guy who the year before had charted with a funky number called “Sally Can’t Dance”. The idea that <i>MMM</i> was a joke or a contract-breaker has been convincingly discredited in the last couple of decades; it seems clear that, whatever Reed’s state of mind in the mid–1970s (and there’s a great deal of evidence that heavy drugs were doing strange things to it), he created the record and put it out there because he thought it sounded neat. “I honestly thought ‘Boy, people who like guitar feedback are gonna go crazy for this.’ Count me among them. If you like loud guitars, here we are,” he told Pitchfork in an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6690-lou-reed/"">interview</a> in 2007.</p>
<p>I’m not a connoisseur of noise but I’ve heard my share, and Reed’s original <i>Metal Machine Music</i> strikes me as one of the more unique albums the genre has produced. You hear it and know what it is immediately. It’s heavy in the midrange and high frequencies, so it can be overpowering at even modest volume, but there is a tremendous amount of textural detail the more closely you listen. Even though it was apparently created with what seem now to be simple tools (guitars, a few pedals, amps) there always seems to be so much going on, and most of all the whole thing is constantly changing, a vibrating sculpture that looks different every time you see it.</p>
<p>A little over a decade ago, the experimental music ensemble <a href=""http://www.zeitkratzer.de/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zeitkratzer</a> began performing a live arrangement of Metal Machine Music. It was the sort of thing that sounded ridiculous: how could you possibly notate this stuff? Composer Ulrich Krieger, working with Zeitkratzer accordion player Luca Venitucci and with Reed’s blessing, found a way. The key to the live <i>MMM</i> project is that the scored version pays particular attention to what’s changing in the music, where our ears initially lock in to what stays the same. <i>Metal Machine Music</i> throbs, with feedback in constant modulation, and that’s part of what makes it sound so alive. Zeitkratzer evoke that quality by having rapidly sawing violins mimmic the squall of the feedback, and with those central oscillations established, the other instruments interject with their drones and squawks and cries and blasts. They performed the composition live with Reed in 2000s, with the orchestrations augmented by his electric guitar, and recordings from those shows were released on CD and DVD in 2007. This new version of the recording is made from more recent Zeitkratzer shows, all acoustic and without Reed, and it’s the first orchestrated version to incorporate the original album’s four 16-minute pieces in full.</p>
<p>The first thing I can say is that Zeitkratzer’s arrangement enriches my appreciation of <i>Metal Machine Music</i> as a whole. The spirit of the music, as well as its general sense of shape structure, is rendered so well it gives you a deeper understanding of what the layers of sound in the original are doing, and how the interplay between the competing bits of noise adds up to something that exceeds the sum of its parts. There’s no question that hearing the music rendered on acoustic instruments (clarinet, trumpet, trombone, piano, bowed guitar, percussion, violin, violincello, doublebass) changes its essential character, and makes it seem more controlled and less dangerous. But the fact that it’s less of a pulse-quickener is offset by the sheer beauty of the sound, and sometimes that sound moves to surprising places. The held trombone drones, for example, lend the music a feeling of symphonic grandeur, and there’s a sense that the piece is in a constant state of collapsing and re-assembling itself.</p>
<p><i>Metal Machine Music</i> in any form isn’t about dynamic range; the music never really gets noticeably quieter or louder; it <i>changes</i>, yes, but only within strict parameters. As such, it’s not “emotional” music in the way I usually think of the term. There is very little in the way of contrast and, since individual emotions acquire meaning by how they differ from other emotions, it’s never about evoking easily named states as “sad” or “frightened” or “angry.” That’s partly why <i>Metal Machine Music</i> works as a mediation piece, a wavelength of energy that some want to be carried along on and others want to avoid at all costs. Zeitkratzer’s version taps even more deeply into that meditative energy and provides another intriguing chapter in a story that, it’s clear now, will have no end.</p></div>"|19662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19662-zeitkratzer-metal-machine-music/|7.6|Mark Richardson

When the director first started working out the details for his pioneering hip-hop docudrama <i>Wild Style</i>, one of the most crucial pieces needed some negotiation: what to do for the beats. The wide-open frontier of emerging hip-hop style meant trends could grab hold fast and then become outmoded just as quickly; a popular break making the rounds during early shooting—say, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLUzATAWfJE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taana Gardner's “Heartbeat”</a>—could be played out from overexposure by the time post-production rolled around. And even turning to the disco, funk, and classic rock staples that still proved deathless through the late 1980s heyday of sampling would've left the production vulnerable to the costs and whims of music licensing and copyright ownership. Ahearn needed a Plan B, and it was this: get together a band and record an entirely new set of instrumentals. Critically, the music would have to be distinctly in keeping with the eclectic source material of early '80s hip-hop breaks without actually falling into soundalike pastiche.</p>
<p>Because music history sneaks up on you sideways, Ahearn's top consultant in soundtrack-related manners was Fab 5 Freddy, who happened to have some left-field collaborators at hand. Before Debbie Harry canonized him by name in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHCdS7O248g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Rapture”</a>, Freddy rubbed elbows with Blondie guitarist Chris Stein as a cameraman and developing, future-VJ on-air personality on Glenn O'Brien's Warhol-sensibility New York cable access show <i>TV Party. </i>Stein's role in the <i>TV Party </i>house band put him in close quarters with drummer Lenny Ferrari, who had to circumvent the TV studio's no-drums policy by banging out beats on an issue of <i>The New Yorker</i>. Throw in a mysterious Brooklyn disco-vet session bassist named David Harpur (or Harper—accounts differ), and you've got the band that Freddy recruited to lay down the instrumentals for what would become cinema's first hip-hop soundtrack—and, as of 1983, one of the last prominent examples of studio-band hip-hop before 808s and, eventually, samplers took precedence.</p>
<p>There have been countless bootlegs, reconstructions, and facsimiles of the <i>Wild Style</i> instrumentals over the years, but this special collection—remastered and overseen by hip-hop and house DJ/re-edit maestro Kenny “Dope” Gonzalez—is as definitive as it gets, albeit while still being mildly revisionist. For one thing, it's the first collection to re-imagine the original <i>Wild Style </i>breakbeats as song-length instrumentals, something the original 100-pressing DJ-only 12-inches never were. Thanks to Kenny Dope's supervision, cuts that were originally a minute and change are stretched further into the three-minute mark, with intros seamlessly looped and breaks nimbly extended into more substantial stand-alone works. There's another catch: as of this writing, the only pressing of this collection is as a combination art book/7” box set. That's fine for at-home listening and perusing, but Serato jockeys and Technics traditionalists alike are out of luck; the all-45s format ironically makes the prospect of actually cutting and mixing them less a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHIsNQ3eh2g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grandmaster Flash</a> true-school tribute than a kind of outlandish impracticality that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfyQVilf9OA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist</a> turned into unprecedented stuntwork.</p>
<p>If you're tempted to hold off on pulling the whole deal apart, you can flip through some sturdy packaging (a book and a 45 folder all in the same heavy binding), read some informative liner notes on the whole making-of process, and get a good look at photos of the original master tape case. (Until practicality demanded otherwise, every track was titled “Funky Break #[1 through 13]”.) It's not just pointless collector-dork debris by any stretch—it's easy to leaf through it and get lost in the atmosphere of the time, the same intersection of hip Uptown and hardcore South Bronx dramatized in the film itself, and get a very real sense of how seat-of-the-pants crazy the creation of this music was. It's hard to pick out which revelation gives the music on this collection more weight: the fact that such taut funk was individually recorded one instrument at a time by each musician, none of whom actually played together during the sessions and some of whom recorded in entirely different studios; that Freddy got Grand Wizard Theodore to make Ferrari a tape of popular breakbeats for inspiration, none of which any of the parties can remember in retrospect; or that the entire expenditure was a ridiculously thrifty $1,000 for three days of work.  </p>
<p>The tracks themselves still resonate, of course, so quintessentially tied into the roots of hip-hop that they're literally impossible to deny, at least from a more contemporary perspective. (Not for nothing does a skulking, slowed-down sample of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K89RsUzDu-U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Subway Beat”</a> take center stage in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17497-illmatic/""><i>Illmatic</i></a>'s<i> </i>scene-setting opener <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhv5Wv5ehnA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Genesis”</a>.) Freddy's masterminding of the original project resulted in an unlikely but resonant collection of future classics, laced with his own wigged-out chaos—the overlaid effects-record sirens, machine guns, old-timey radio announcers, and ad-libs are his doing. And Ferrari's unshakably expert drumming and Chris Stein's weirdo-dub Roland guitar synthesizer effects gave centerpieces like the spaced-out <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMshcUJGB_0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Cuckoo Clocking”</a> and the glowering <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNL7dx1FIc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Gangbusters”</a> an off-kilter personality that was hard to mistake for anything else.  </p>
<p>The catch was that some of these beats were a bit <i>too</i> off-kilter: when the original 100 copies containing the minute-and-change instrumentals were handed out, DJs like Flash, Grandmixer DXT, and Grand Wizard Theodore gravitated towards roughly half of the total tracks on offer, with the relatively straightforward, rubber-bass funk stylings of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-Viq2qGIks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Down By Law”</a> proving an almost monopolized consensus choice because it skewed the closest to the traditional breaks they'd already familiarized themselves with. Some cuts, like the serrated, bottom-heavy <i>Warriors </i>funk of “Subway Beat” became acquired-taste staples—“kind of dry,” in Theodore's words—though the film's success in hip-hop circles sped up other instrumentals' adoption in the crates of the select few DJs who possessed them.</p>
<p>Others were put by the wayside, much to Ahearn's disappointment, ostensibly for being a bit too weird. Some of that disappointment is justified—in the liner notes, Ahearn likens one of the unused instrumentals to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15725-watch-the-throne/"">Watch the Throne</a> </i>highlight <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJt7gNi3Nr4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“No Church in the Wild”</a>, and a listen to the simmering John Carpenter-does-Afrobeat “Jungle Beat” bears out that comparison. Wringing a few rare surprises and a few more new interpretations out of an essential classic is worth the boutique treatment, and this box gives yet another level to what was originally perceived as low-budget, Plan B kind of music. Thanks to the liner notes' context, Kenny Dope's immaculate edits, and the way history played out, the <i>Wild Style </i>instrumentals sure don't sound like a hastily assembled oddball stopgap now.</p></div>"|19694.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19694-kenny-dope-wild-style-breakbeats/|8.4|Nate Patrin

Seems like a fair enough trade-off, but even those fans who are most tolerant of Wayne’s social-media madcappery had to be thinking “<i>really,</i> <i>dude?</i>” last spring when some especially ill-advised photos led to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55030-kliph-scurlock-says-he-was-fired-from-flaming-lips-for-standing-up-to-wayne-coynes-friends-racism/"">accusations of racism</a>, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55124-the-flaming-lips-wayne-coyne-blasts-hateful-pathological-liar-kliph-scurlock/"">extremely acrimonious ousting of long-time Lips drummer Kliph Scurlock</a> (the fallout from which <a href=""http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-31972-native_american_rights_group_protests_the_flaming_lips_at_waterfront_park.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">continues to spread</a>).</p>
<p>In light of this, the debut of the Lips’ prog-inspired alter-ego act the Electric Würms couldn’t have come at a better time. By promoting redoubtable multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd to bandleader and reducing Coyne to background noisemaker (with Nashville psych-rock outfit Linear Downfall playing the role of an absent Michael Ivins), the new project effectively doubles as a form of damage control, redirecting our attention back to the ongoing evolution of what has been a remarkably productive and intriguingly unpredictable phase for the band. Even that Teutonic album title—which apparently translates as “music that’s hard to twerk to”—offers the guarantee of a Miley-free zone. </p>
<p>Given that Drozd has long been the de facto musical director of the Flaming Lips, the Würms unsurprisingly stick to the post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13522-embryonic/""><i>Embryonic</i></a> playbook, to the point where the new band name is practically immaterial, and <i>Musik, die Schwer zu Twerk</i> could just as easily be the (slightly) sunnier follow-up to the blood-red-skied electro-psych of 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17804-the-flaming-lips-the-terror/""><i>The Terror</i></a>. And when you consider how much Coyne’s voice was fused into the textural mist on that album, Drozd’s soft, childlike coo doesn’t have much opportunity to distinguish itself amid the shock-treatment synths, radio-static guitar fuzz, and stellar-drift drums. Oddly, for an album that cheekily presents itself as a long-lost ’70s prog cut-out bin artifact, <i>Musik, die Schwer zu Twerk</i>’s most notable characteristic may be its 29-minute brevity, offering a tasting-menu sampler of the various modes the Lips have been exploring for the past five years. It’s almost as if the Lips have formed a cover-band-medley version of themselves.</p>
<p>So in lieu of prog’s multi-sectional intricacy, each of the six tracks here lock into discrete themes, from the mirage-like space-age bachelor-pad smear of “Futuristic Hallucination” to the <i>Live-Evil</i>-era Miles (by way of Yoko Ono’s <i>Fly</i>) psych-funk shriek of “Transform!!!” However, these four-minute spurts are too free-ranging to establish a melodic logic, yet too steady in execution to achieve maximal freak-out potential; with its creeping rhythm, quavering vocal, and steampiped-synth exhaust, “The Bat” is very much sonically of a piece with <i>The Terror</i>, but feels insubstantial outside a similarly elaborate context.</p>
<p>Ironically, focus arrives in the form of a cover of Yes’ hyrda-headed dinosaur-rock colossus “Heart of the Sunrise,” which simply lops off <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzznd-afn94"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vincent Gallo’s favorite build-up</a> and the <a href=""http://youtu.be/6z8_45duq6A?t=8m6s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">arpeggiated closing act</a> and condenses it into a pure and simple four-minute star-gazing ballad, with Drozd doing an eerily spot-on Jon Anderson. (That said, the attempt at writing a modern-day Yes song—“I Could Only See Clouds”—is less satisfying, with a placid central melody that never fully adheres to the intrusive Howe/Squire-worthy contorto-riff.) But it’s not surprising that the Würms find their greatest success the further they venture from the Lips mothership and the longer they stay the course. With the Neu! hypno-rock pulse of “Living,” the band turn in both their headiest jam and most dramatic song, with Drozd’s ghostly voice sounding like a final transmission to mission control before he and Coyne thrust themselves into the coldest, darkest reaches of outer space—or, at the very least, somewhere with no smartphone reception.</p></div>"|19598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19598-electric-wurms-musik-die-schwer-zu-twerk/|6.5|Stuart Berman

The beats were shadier than those he sang over when he was making music under his own name, Jahron Brathwaite, and so was his character. ""You got wild bitches telling you lies"" he sang on ""Wild Bitches"", a line so <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">Weeknd</a>-esque that it's kind of shocking Abel Tesfaye didn't get to it first; elsewhere, he boasted of ejaculating on a lover. While his voice sounded great in the dingier digs, the sleaziness felt grafted onto his personality in a way that always felt artificial, and it clashed with his more genuine—and compelling—loverman tendencies.</p>
<p>Brathwaite has scrubbed this occasional creepiness from his sophomore effort, as <i>PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO</i> matches his self-assured cockiness with an increased benevolent streak. He spends the majority of the album in awe of the women he sings about: ""East Liberty"" teems with talk of sunset-watching and proclamations of ""forever""; in less capable hands, a line like ""the ocean's calling your name"" would be an eye-roller, but Brathwaite's puppy-dog earnestness—not to mention the track's woozy, dense throb—prevents it from inducing gag reflexes. Brathwaite does open-minded sincerity much more convincingly than he does charming asshole: ""I want you to turn up every night on me when I see you,"" he urges on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>-assisted ""Recognize"" while acknowledging upfront that both he and the woman he's singing to have other lovers. There's a refreshing lack of jealousy and possessiveness on <i>PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO</i>, even as Brathwaite argues that he's in a league far above his competition on almost every song here.</p>
<p>Dropping his defenses helps turn PARTYNEXTDOOR into a project that feels more like Brathwaite's own creation rather than one that primarily (and cynically) reconfigures of-the-moment sounds, but it's still very much a project in perpetual conversation with the rest of today's R&amp;B and rap landscapes. Brathwaite inhabits the same world as his boss, Drake, a place where it's difficult to tell exactly where singing becomes rapping and rapping becomes singing. This time around, he unapologetically swipes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>'s higher-and-higher-and-<i>higher</i> delivery and the relentless triplet cadence that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a> has breathed life into, both of which are employed on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>Brathwaite isn't afraid to look into the past, either. He takes Dru Hill's ""Share My World"" and slow-roasts it overnight for the sweltering ""SLS"", and the moment the track finally takes off is one of the album's biggest thrills. ""Muse"" finds PARTYNEXTDOOR submerging Ginuwine's ""Only When Ur Lonely"" in a vat of ink, thickening it up into a viscous sludge. Not all sample choices turn out so well, though—specifically, an egregious sample of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"">Disclosure</a>'s ""Latch"" on horndog anthem ""Sex on a Beach"" feels like a play for borrowed interest rather than an inspired recontextualization of a recent hit. Someone will flip ""Latch"" in an intriguing way, it just won't be PARTYNEXTDOOR.</p>
<p>But <i>PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO</i> succeeds, much like its predecessor, largely thanks to Brathwaite's aptitude for mood. His molasses-thick production continues to get weirder in subtle ways; tracks that recall early-'90s R&amp;B suspended in amber (""Grown Woman"") sit next to tracks that sound like they come from an alternate universe where Vangelis has become the go-to producer for decaying bangers. Lyrically, <i>PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO</i> doesn't have its eyes on anything original, and its back half suffers from a turgid sameness that eventually numbs, but Brathwaite's second album functions something like Toronto's answer to ratch&amp;B, replacing the dirtbag charm (or ugliness, as some argue) of someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> with a more benign disposition.</p></div>"|19705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19705-partynextdoor-partynextdoor-two/|6.8|Renato Pagnani

The 24-year-old London producer’s “Venture” appears in the mix’s propulsive opening third, coming off of the effervescent, slightly wistful clipped vocals and stuttered drums of Flava D’s “Hold On VIP 3”; as that tune closes out, “Venture” announces itself with Silva’s signature name-dropping tag (“Lil-Lil Silva-Silva”) as a dense bass hit drops into the foreview. The tune continues to twist and turn with squiggly low end, shrill hi-hats, and a skipping percussive gait, and although it only sticks around for a minute and change, its presence as a capable, impressively detailed instrumental grime tune is deeply felt.</p>
<p>”Venture” first appeared as a white label release back in 2013, fronted by the slower, slightly dub-inflected “The Split”, and both tunes are representative of the sound—hard-hitting, somewhat skeletal, pleasing while retaining a sense of intimidation—that Lil Silva’s developed over the past six years. Many of his grime-focused singles have seen release on Night Slugs, the UK dance hub responsible for some of the most forward-thinking club fare from this decade thus far. But Silva’s work as a grime technician, notable as it is, only provides a partial view of his burgeoning career. The rest of it began, in tandem, with the 2011 single “On Your Own”, a collaboration from currently in-demand UK vocalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31502-sampha/"">Sampha</a> that appeared on Silva’s sole release from that year, <i>The Patience</i> EP. The song’s rushing percussion and general sense of motion were unmistakably the work of Silva’s, but almost every other element suggested a turn towards pop, with moody atmospherics and a sense of song construction that smacked of Todd Terry’s classic remix of Everything But the Girl’s “Missing”.</p>
<p>”On Your Own” was, above all else, well-timed—it made the rounds just a few months after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"">James Blake</a>’s genre-upheaving <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15081-james-blake/"">self-titled debut LP</a> was released, and its canny mix of pop structure and dancefloor motifs slotted in nicely alongside Blake’s own sonic recontextualizations. But “On Your Own” didn’t quite take off in the public consciousness, and 2012 saw Silva briefly returning to his knottier roots, including a release for Night Slugs’ strictly-for-functionality <i>Club Constructions</i> series. The following year, though, he returned to the increasingly crowded field of UK club-pop auteurs with the <i>Distance</i> EP; with Sampha again in tow, along with UK up-and-comer Rosie Lowe, the EP was another step towards the nocturnal sounds of post-Blake dance-pop, even as UK crossover dance fare was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"">already in the throes of another</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31420-rudimental/"">more explicitly retro upheaval</a>.</p>
<p><i>Distance</i> carried some of Silva’s sonic traits from his stronger, more club-oriented fare—clapping percussion, squelchy bass, a fiery sense of menace—but the EP’s more straightforward cuts were forgettable, suggesting that Silva was willing to embrace a greater accessibility even if it meant sacrificing a sense of personality. <i>Mabel</i>, his latest EP, continues in that dismaying direction, even if its opening track suggests otherwise: “First Mark” is a serviceable mid-tempo bass cut riding a serpentine low end, as clattering kitchen-sink percussion pleasingly knocks about underneath the rude bassline. It doesn’t have the fire of Silva’s strongest productions, but it’s the sole track on <i>Mabel</i> that suggests the producer who was responsible for those past glories is still, if not totally present, occasionally rising to the surface for air.</p>
<p>As for the rest of <i>Mabel</i>: if you’ve listened to a shred of fashionable post-Blake dance-pop or creeping, purple-on-gray alt-R&amp;B in the last five years, you’ve already heard what this EP has to offer. Silva’s singing voice is present throughout, and the basic strength of his light, airy upper register is an impressive surprise. But it never establishes a forceful presence on these tunes. His aromatic vocal foil is in the form of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31651-banks/"">Banks</a>, the Los Angeles singer whose own trend-chasing alt-R&amp;B has already beaten detractors to their own punchlines by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEbLXPiClFE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soundtracking lingerie advertisements</a>, and the two tracks she appears on—the wobbly “Don’t You Love” and the atmospheric crawl of “Right for You”, the latter of which bears uncomfortably close resemblance to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28714-jai-paul/"">Jai Paul</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13378-jasmine/"">“Jasmine”</a>—are indistinct entries in the increasingly tired sub-genre, their moody sense of torpor approaching self-parody.</p>
<p>”First Mark” aside, things pick up a bit on the title track, a figurative update of “On Your Own” that swaps Sampha’s dusky vocals for Silva’s capable pipes and carries a brisk gait constantly on the brink of taking the shape of something more explosive. It doesn’t, though, and while it seems unfair to say that Lil Silva is holding back on <i>Mabel</i>—a hallmark of the strains of dance-pop represented here is restraint, and anything more than that is considered to upset the general mood—it’s frustrating nonetheless to hear a young, talented producer capable of truly exciting work setting his sights instead on trendy sounds so exhausted that they risk putting the listener to sleep.</p></div>"|19690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19690-lil-silva-mabel-ep/|5.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

The band was new, but its members weren’t untested; all four were veterans of the Louisville scene, a fertile field that had nurtured everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"">Slint</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a> to By The Grace of God. Coliseum’s vocalist/guitarist Ryan Patterson had most recently served in Black Cross, a seething post-hardcore band that also featured By The Grace of God singer Rob Pennington. But Patterson had never fronted his own outfit, despite all the time he’d spent in notable Louisville groups such as Metroschifter, The Enkindels, and The National Acrobat. In short, he had something to prove—and Coliseum’s self-titled, 2004 debut was that proof. </p>
<p>A decade later, <i>Coliseum</i> still makes a compelling case. Out of print since 2006, the album has been overhauled and expanded for a tenth-anniversary reissue. It’s likely to go down as the only reissue in history produced by a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3733-sebadoh/"">Sebadoh</a> (Jason Loewenstein) and remixed by a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31196-toxic-holocaust/"">Toxic Holocaust</a> (Joel Grind)—a fact that’s indicative of Patterson’s wide-ranging sensibility. Not that <i>Coliseum</i> is what you’d call eclectic: Like chunks of charred flesh, “Detached” and “Burn Out Bright” come with a stench of agony and angst that splits the admittedly slim difference between the vintage D.C. hardcore of Swiz and the apocalyptic d-beat of Discharge. But the album isn’t just straight homage to ’80s punk; on “Hostage of Privilege”, the bruised, lunging blues of classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7759-motorhead/"">Motörhead</a> is shoehorned in—“Fast” Eddie-esque solo and all—and on “Give Up and Drive,” there’s a dissonant, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2171-jawbox/"">Jawbox</a>-like interplay between Patterson and second guitarist Tony Ash. But it all congeals into a howling, harrowing whole.</p>
<p>Patterson’s lyrics dwell on politics and pain, hardcore’s standby settings, so it’s all in the delivery—and his voice is an air-raid siren pitch-shifted down to the frequency of an earthmover. That tone is used for surprisingly fun effect on one of the <i>Coliseum</i> reissue’s bonus tracks, a previously unreleased cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"">Ramones</a>’ “Judy Is a Punk”. Instead of singing it straight, Patterson trawls his own intestinal tract in search of the perfect, sustained grunt. It makes for one of the best Ramones covers in ages, although Patterson doesn’t nail the chemistry quite as well on Coliseum’s cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29078-fear/"">Fear</a>’s “I Don’t Care About You”, the other cover that appears among the bonus tracks. Originally part of the band’s 2004 split 7” with fellow Louisville band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4990-swords/"">Lords</a>, it’s a rock-solid rendition, but it doesn’t do much besides fulfilling the needs of completism.</p>
<p>The remainder of Coliseum’s half of the split single with Lords is more essential— in particular, the song “No Salvation”. Three years later, Patterson would use that title for Coliseum’s sophomore album; here, it’s the reissue's fiercest track, a harbinger of the needling mixture of anxiety and aggression to come. Demo versions of four<i> Coliseum</i> songs are also included, but they serve to show just how quickly the group came together between 2003 and 2004. There’s a knuckle-gnawing desperation to these tinnier iterations that Patterson only intensified by the time they entered the garage with Loewenstein, itching to lay down a statement.</p>
<p>Multiplatinum punks were all the rage in 2004, but that year also saw milestone releases from a profusion of post-hardcore groups, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8269-oxeneers-or-the-lion-sleeps-when-its-antelope-go-home/"">These Arms Are Snakes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/809-crimes/"">The Blood Brothers</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1141-charmer/"">Breather Resist</a> among them. (In fact, Patterson’s younger brother, Evan Patterson, played in Breather Resist—and now <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5106-young-widows/"">Young Widows</a>, with whom Coliseum issued a split in 2006.) Coliseum represented the extreme wing of that wave of groups; they hardwired brains and intricacy into a thunderous undercarriage of sludge and crust, and in doing so wound up creating a more timeless debut than most of their contemporaries.</p>
<p>Patterson is the only remaining original member of Coliseum, and the band has broadened its horizons even further since 2004; his old Louisville comrade, Will Oldham, even pops up as a guest on their 2010 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14530-house-with-a-curse/"">House With a Curse</a></i>. A decade is a long time to be puking blood and pissing battery acid, and Coliseum’s ability to tweak the attack over the years has kept their music vital. But <i>Coliseum</i>’s strength—then and now—lies in its lockjaw tenacity, its willingness to buck every expectation while boiling hardcore down to the thickness of tar. Not to mention a deep belief in punk’s prerogative to scrap the bullshit and start over.</p></div>"|19519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19519-coliseum-coliseum/|7.8|Jason Heller

But the opening to Nachtmystium's latest record, <i>The World We Left Behind</i>, doesn’t establish a tone that’s particularly infernal, anxious, depraved, or depressive—qualities to be expected from what might be the final record from these black metal modifiers. Instead, the spiraling, simple riff and plodding rhythm section betray a presiding laziness, a lack of effort and imagination that feel altogether alien for the long-intriguing Chicago band. Even when the drums finally shift into a gallop and Nachtmystium trigger a quick, classic thrash finale, the fatigue is palpable, as though the band is staring expectantly at a countdown wall clock, ticking patiently toward the end.</p>
<p>That air of obligation presides during <i>The World We Left Behind</i>, a nine-track slog that follows an intense period of personal and professional turmoil for founder Blake Judd. Nachtmystium has always dealt with one form of ignominy or another, from associations with racist factions of the metal underground to a perpetual motion machine of ever-changing membership. Judd’s consistently used Nachtmystium’s music as an act of bloodletting, then, a chance to let his problems with addiction and despair drip into public awareness.</p>
<p>But since the release of 2012’s <i>Silencing Machine</i>, he’s ripped off fans and distributors for merchandise he never delivered. In October, <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1510492/nachtmystiums-blake-judd-arrested-for-theft/news/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he was arrested</a> for theft and given a bail of $25,000. A month later and out of jail, Judd issued a statement to thank fans for their support, to say he was retreating for a bit and to release “Voyager,” the first cut from a forthcoming Nachtmystium album that <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2013/11/blake_judd_rele.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“has everything to do with the demons I’ve been battling leading up to this very dark period of my life.”</a> If the circumstances around its release weren’t so dim, the song might have been taken as a joke. Above an undifferentiated mess of cheap riffs and unsophisticated drum rolls, Judd screamed from his diary like a pimply teen: “Striving along, year after year/ This is my calling, I have no fear.” When Century Media announced that the album from which it was taken would be <a href=""http://www.centurymedia.com/newsdetailed.aspx?IdNews=14668&amp;IdCompany=2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nachtmystium’s finale</a>, which Judd recently <a href=""http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/yes/nachtmystium-didnt-break-up"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recanted</a>, the decision seemed to make sense. “Voyager” proclaimed that Nachtmystium had little to offer aside from the transmission of Judd’s whimpering ego, anyway. End it already.   </p>
<p>During the last half of the last decade, Nachtmystium made music that suggested black metal in America might not always hang out in its dark, cloistered corners or its critically sanctioned circles. From 2006’s <i>Instinct: Decay</i> to the two-album <i>Black Meddle</i> set that followed, Nachtmystium resurfaced popular canvases, like the thrum of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a> or the sprawl of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a>, with serrated screams and quick-picked guitars. You could <i>almost</i> imagine it on the radio. <i>Silencing Machine</i>, released in 2012, pulled back on the pop drive and the psychedelic breadth, retrenching the aggression of the band’s earlier material while not giving up altogether on the recent exploration, either.</p>
<p>Anything on <i>The World We Left Behind </i>that feels vaguely experimental, however, is almost altogether inchoate. The best moments here are the most focused and formed. The first four minutes of “Into the Endless Abyss” offer some of the most direct and compelling black metal of Judd’s career. A cavalcade of drums powers a magisterial wash of guitars, moving in waves beneath Judd’s end-times desperation. Its power recalls the charge of <i>Instinct: Decay </i>and <i>Silencing Machine</i>, its romance the allure of <i>Addicts: Black Meddle Pt. II</i>. And though the title track lingers too long in both the prelude and the postlude, the middle traces a wonderful arc of momentum, pushing ahead through a succession of increasingly grand moments. The chorus is simple, undistracted and effective, Judd fashioning despair into a hook that catches on the first pass. It’s the epitome of Nachtmystium’s magnetism.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, though, efficiency seems like an anathema for Judd, whose lassitude shows here not only in a dearth of imagination but also through a general lack of editing. Without necessity and with the warning only of a quick guitar-pick slide and a grunt, the great “Into the Endless Abyss” shifts into a truly abysmal second half of four-on-the-floor dance metal. Above laughable video-game synthesizers and a beat that could last for days until someone took notice, Judd yells about descending “into this mortal hell.” You kind of wish he’d stop talking about it and get going already—at least <i>that</i> would have saved him from the song’s second half.</p>
<p>Likewise, “In the Absence of Existence” is a seven-minute, string-padded rock waltz with no more payoff than an attenuated chorus of self-pitying juvenilia. “Hidden away, alone I pray/ For a quick death every day/Never a moment to get away,” Judd croaks. During some of the song’s instrumental breaks (and there are plenty), you can hear the utter lack of inspirations and ideas. A sidewinding guitar hangs mostly still, waiting for something else to do. A synthesizer swells, searching for a role bigger than that of ancillary noisemaker. Instead, the song just marches from one final refrain into a distended dénouement, doubling down on the time it’s wasted by repurposing the same filler solo it’s already used. Closer “Epitaph for a Dying Star” delivers Judd’s approximation of vogue shoegaze-and-black-metal chimeras, assisted by a gospel singer’s ululations and padded production. It lasts for nearly eight unchanging minutes that you’ll never get back. </p>
<p>Indeed, all of the problems on <i>The World We Left Behind</i>—the absence of transition and sequence, the lack of focus and coherence, the presence of awful lyrics and middling riffs—all seem to be symptoms of its creator’s vainglory. Judd gives priority to his time and problems even though he has little compelling to say about them and even less to give to the supporters for whom he is “deeply grateful.” Judd has the audacity to overindulge on the unimaginative and peddle its whimpering results as some grand closing statement—at least for a time, at least until it is convenient to<a href=""http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/yes/nachtmystium-didnt-break-up"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> take it all back.</a></p></div>"|19677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19677-nachtmystium-the-world-we-left-behind/|3.9|Grayson Haver Currin

For such a crowded and seemingly welcoming genre, though, the sound itself is hard to get right, but when it is, it’s exhilarating, like the music itself has been subject to a Rube Goldberg machine for beatmaking, with no part too ridiculous to use. The risk is ending up with “pop music for people who don’t like pop music”: too restrained to really sink its hooks in, yet not quite intricate or patient enough for a slower approach, and usually carrying airs of preciousness. It's a trap that ensnares many, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"">the biggest of pop stars</a> to the most DIY of bedroom producers—but when artists manage to avoid it, the results can be thrilling.</p>
<p>For now, Mozart’s Sister—the project of Montreal’s Caila Thompson-Hannant, formerly of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4838-shapes-and-sizes/"">Shapes and Sizes</a>—have sidestepped these pitfalls. Naming herself after the hypothetical auteur from <i>A Room of One’s Own </i>(<a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2013/02/26/interview-mozarts-sister/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as she puts it</a>, the B-list to Mozart’s A-lister)<i>, </i>Thompson-Hannant taught herself to produce with a demo version of Ableton and worked her way up the equipment ladder. She’s an apt student of tech and vocal tricks, swooping from <i>sotto voce</i> to a diva-like belt at a single hook’s notice. In these ways, she has peers: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"">Grimes</a>—a friend of Thompson-Hannant’s—is an obvious reference point, as is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift/"">Chairlift</a>'s Caroline Polachek on her album from this year as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32111-ramona-lisa/"">Ramona Lisa</a>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19287-ramona-lisa-arcadia/"">Arcadia</a></i>, as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"">tUnE-yArDs</a> in her less frenetic moments.</p>
<p>But Mozart’s Sister’s riffs and hooks suggest Thompson-Hannant is looking equally toward peers on the other side of the divide. She has this balance in mind from the first track, “Good Thing Bad Thing”: “Give me the body, but don’t sacrifice brains/And give me the brains, but don’t sacrifice the love pains.” As with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30260-alunageorge/"">AlunaGeorge</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18298-alunageorge-body-music/""><i>Body Music </i></a>(the paradox of alt-pop albums like this, by the way, is that they’re usually self-consciously the work of auteurs, yet very difficult to talk about without naming peers), it’s a simplified metaphor, but gets at the idea well enough.</p>
<p>Later, Thompson-Hannant drops another line that describes her approach: “Holding hands with the good and the bad simultaneously.” “I think I was trying to make sunny songs, but they didn’t come out that way,” Thompson-Hannant told the <i><a href=""http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Mozart+Sister+didn+come+into+Being+easily/10049677/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Montreal Gazette</a>. “</i>Demented is what I’m going for.” While her best tracks aren’t quite demented, it’s fascinating to hear them attempt that ideal regardless. “Faif” resembles a R&amp;B crossover track from 10 years ago wiped out with a chalk eraser until only the fuzzed-over verse and prechorus remain; the lithe melisma and tinny beat of “Enjoy” suggests Thompson-Hannant played <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/"">Kelela</a> and chiptunes on separate speakers and recreated what she heard. “Chained Together” is like a lowing goose trapped in a chirpy pop song, lending an extra disturbing bit of codependency to the title, while “Do It to Myself (run run)” crafts a subtle hook from skewed backing vocals, synth cowbell and something resembling the cave groans from a <i>Commander Keen </i>game. The main vocal line’s so low in the mix and muttered that it takes a while for the a narrative of domestic abuse, which starts with “Daddy’s got a gun” and gets darker as it goes, to sink in. As with and possibly more so than many similar albums, <i>Being </i>rewards time over immediacy.</p>
<p>But it’s seldom a good sign when an artist admits in interviews that their album’s “<a href=""http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Mozart+Sister+didn+come+into+Being+easily/10049677/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unfocused</a>,” and<i> Being </i>suffers as such. Sometimes, a single sonic element grates, such as the unwieldy shrieks of “Good Thing Bad Thing.” Elsewhere, Thompson-Hannant almost seems reluctant to fully commit to the pop song she’s written; the hook on “My House Is Wild” is about half as big as its a cappella frame calls for, and “Lone Wolf” is pleasant enough but has neither an outsider’s stalk nor the gleeful predation of, say, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ssrLSheg4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shakira’s take</a> on the theme.</p>
<p>“Salty Tear” and “Don’t Leave It to Me” are older tracks–the latter appearing on last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17699-mozarts-sister-hello-ep/"">Hello</a> </i>EP–and accordingly scan as rough drafts included on the record regardless; the latter, in particular, finds its central element, a chantlike “Fear, fear, fear!/ Sex, sex, sex!”, reprised on “A Move” as “Death-love-life-want.” (Perhaps both tracks could've stood to be revised entirely, as the abstract Freudian stuff is one incantation away from a flop-prone <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4By_cfI_1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Natalia Kills song</a>.) That said, the <i>other </i>three-quarters of “A Move” are stunning, with a drifting croon, a little like mid-career <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1703-lisa-germano/"">Lisa Germano</a>, so muted it stops entirely toward the middle; parts of “Enjoy” and “Do It to Myself” plumb the quieter end of the dynamic range to the same hypnotic effect. Perhaps counterintuitively, <i>Being </i>is most compelling as a pop album when it’s not trying to hook you; the rest is promising, but perhaps could do with a little more dementedness.</p></div>"|19699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19699-mozarts-sister-being/|6.4|Katherine St. Asaph

This is no small feat in a 13-tape discography stretching back eight years (2007's <i>Boss Shit</i>, recorded when he was just a teenager, was his debut). <i>Tony</i>'s overriding purpose is to reassert Louie's centrality within the drill scene, a movement for which he was mainly responsible, and what this means is doubling down on all the signifiers that drove critics and casual fans towards, then away from, Chicago street rap over the past three years. Unapologetic, Louie marshals the bleak language and imagery of violence to craft a world where brutal realism and mythos collide, where reality bleeds indiscriminately into art, and the extreme is everyday.</p>
<p>Thematically and conceptually, this isn't new terrain for street rap. What is novel is the sound Louie's cultivated throughout, which is darker, more coherent, more purposeful than before. <i>Tony</i> crackles with an empowering, unpredictable energy, his performance concomitant with the tape's horror film canvas. The beats are gritty and seething, hi-hats running a jagged course through storm cloud production, disembodied voices swirling in a haunted chorale. His cast of producers—including DJ L, Jay Storm, C-Sick, Hearon Trackz, and Smylez—use texture as a weapon, abrasively breaking through the predictable motions. This noise-driven approach conjures a specific kind of ""realism"": it's all tactile surfaces and spatial dynamics, the experience of heightened senses, the situational awareness of an adrenaline rush.</p>
<p>The increased urgency of <i>Tony</i> dials back and disguises certain other qualities that were common to Louie's more recent work. He's always been a funny writer who never oversold a punchline; here, humor keeps the album from sounding dour, but its presence is never telegraphed, as even his amusing punch-ins (""I should have a holiday (No school!)"") are secondary to the portentous mood. His rap style is typically nonchalant, with lyrics delivered in a slurred cadence that sell meaning as an afterthought. He adapts with surprising ease to a more apocalyptic setting: forcefulness renders his mumble into a smear on ""Difference"". On opener ""B.O.N."", his words batter the listener with percussive start-stop flows that build into repeating patterns (""Talking broke is foreign, my teeth cost a foreign/ Yo' bitch on the horn, tryna shoot a porn""). But nuance and emotion are in his writing, not his delivery. His rap style remains one of detached cool, more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">Biggie</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"">Pac</a>: a performance of control, not catharsis.</p>
<p><i>Tony</i> itself, however, sounds very much like catharsis, and more like a product of Makaveli-era 2Pac more than any other album in recent memory. That quality is found beyond the song title allusions of ""Live &amp; Die in Chicago"" and ""Ambitions as a Rider""; the record's raw, sparking, exposed-wire sound boils over with intensity. It's also found in Louie's religious fatalism, and in the language that renders Louie in mythic terms throughout. On records like ""G.O.D."" and ""God &amp; King"", he's a transcendent figure even amidst the dirt: ""I'm a God/ Gold wings cause I'm heaven-sent.""</p>
<p><i>Tony</i>'s second half opens up musically, letting a bit of light shine in before the disembodied voices return. It begins with ""Michael Jackson Money"", a lone soft-focus melodic gem with pithily clever bars (""My sister Janet/ I want Michael Jackson money/ Might buy a planet""). The guitar-driven ""Ambitions"" is the most narratively gripping, with a level of autobiographical depth that scrapes the heart: ""I ain't gave a fuck since I was my daughter's size/ I gain ambition when I look in my daughter's eyes/ Who ever knew I would succeed after all them tries?/ This last year I lost respect for a lotta guys.""</p>
<p>Louie's world may be narrower than Pac's, as his sympathies are focused on his city, the revolutionary spirit confined to the perspective of a street corner militant. Injustice is local: snitching, deception, betrayal, and abandonment of one's hometown. These may seem like straightforward values but the consequences echo: what does one sacrifice to commit oneself, as Louie does on ""Live &amp; Die in Chicago,"" the album's climax? ""My city influenced my country, can't get away from Chicago/ They ask me, Louie, you gon' leave? No, I'm gon' stay in Chicago/ I'm the heart of Chicago."" Two bars later, he calls himself the city's 2Pac.</p>
<p>In 2014, Chicago's street rap scene is fractured, and <i>Tony</i> feels like a response to the disparate paths its biggest stars have taken. ""The industry don't give me credit 4 none of shit I started,"" Louie <a href=""https://twitter.com/KingL/status/484831334255181824"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a> earlier this year. While Bobby Shmurda adapts drill's sound to a new setting and a deal with <a href=""http://www.epicrecords.com/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Epic Records</a>, Louie remains on hold with the same label. <i>Tony</i>, a return to his roots, is a reassertion of ownership. Although he's sacrificed the sonic diversity and irreverence that made records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13669-val-venis/"">""Val Venis""</a> so <i>sui generis</i>, his frustrations in the industry have focused his talents to a serrated edge.</p></div>"|19645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19645-king-louie-tony/|7.9|David Drake

From a listener’s perspective, however, that blessing has been mixed. Formed by Carney and keyboardist Chris Connolly, Desertshore began as a dusky, post-rock-inflected instrumental project with the release of their debut album, 2010’s <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9equv4qPgIc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drifting Your Majesty</a></i>. Kozelek eased himself in as a guest vocalist on 2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16095-drawing-of-threes/"">Drawing of Threes</a></i>; by the time 2013’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18363-desertshore-mark-kozelek-and-desertshore/"">Mark Kozelek and Desertshore</a></i> rolled around, his name was on the marquee. Understandably, a project that features Kozelek as well as a member of his own bands was going to get compared to those bands. In that comparison, <i>Mark Kozelek and Desertshore</i> turned out pretty well— and that was the problem. Desertshore no longer seemed like a distinct entity; in fact, the group barely ever had the chance to establish itself as such in the first place.</p>
<p><i>Migrations of Glass</i> is Desertshore’s fourth album, and Kozelek—who’s gained a lot of attention lately from <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvNAHBI1V4o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Benji</a></i>, no complaints there—has scaled back his contribution to one track, “Crosstown Seven”. On that track, he only plays bass; his sepia croon is nowhere to be found. For all intents and purposes, then, <i>Migrations </i>might as well be Desertshore’s second album instead of its fourth. The core of Carney and Connolly is once again the nerve center, and not only have they found new facets of their instrumental dynamic to explore, they’ve done so with more passion. On “Crosstown Seven”, arpeggios are laced together intricately, a dizzying crisscross of pings and peals that render guitar and piano practically indistinguishable. The rhythm section measures out a mathy tempo that’s nonetheless light as dandelion fluff, reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/"">the Sea and Cake</a> circa <i>The Biz</i>. Kozelek’s bass line, bottom-heavy yet buoyant, is all the outside contribution that’s needed. </p>
<p>“Crosstown Seven” is just one bone in <i>Migration</i>’s sturdy rock spine—it's a holdover from <i>Drifting</i>, which sounded as if it could have been a Sun Kil Moon session before vocals had been laid down. “Until Morning Comes” is the track on <i>Migration</i> that comes closest to Sun Kil Moon’s more orthodox songwriting, but Carney’s smoky strumming tells a story all its own, naturally set somewhere in the inverse twilight of the predawn calm. Connolly’s keys do most of the speaking, though, thanks to his eerie ability to phrase melodies as warm, organic cadences. Carney may not have played on <i>Benji</i>, but Connolly did; he’s best heard toward the end of “Micheline”, where his subtle tinkling feels like a ghostly whisper. He reprises that sensation on the ostensible sequel to “Until Morning Comes”, “The Morning Is Open”, which paints an expressionistic portrait of stillness, sunlight, and the potential energy they contain. It’s gorgeously placid, even bordering on new age. Carney and Connolly are invading new territory, and they’re occupying it with quiet conviction. </p>
<p>As synched as the two musicians are throughout most of <i>Migrations</i>, it’s their contrast that holds the most promise. Connolly is classically trained, and it’s hard not to assume he’s referencing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a>—particularly works like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKjUKCI0IyE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Music In Similar Motion”</a>— on <i>Migration</i>’s “Glasslight”, a study in cascading, oscillation-rich minimalism. On Carney’s end, he takes the lead on “Intermezzo”, a Takoma-style quickie for unaccompanied guitar that manages to pack a wealth of haunting, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/starter/9314-john-fahey/"">John Fahey</a>-esque twang into a one-minute burst. “Tempest Armada”, on the other hand, is the longest song in the album, eleven minutes of melodic post-rock peaks, valleys, and curved surfaces that’s reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/870-cul-de-sac/"">Cul de Sac</a>’s most arresting epics. There’s a sprawl to <i>Migrations</i> that shows more confidence and ambition than all of Desertshore’s prior output combined. It doesn’t always click, though: “Enduro Nocturno” doesn’t commit deeply enough to its celestial Krautrock thrum, and the Crazy Horse-goes-fusion vibe of “Mesa Verde” has too many clashing angles. But when it does come together, which is often, it shows that Carney and Connolly are well on their way to climbing out from under the boss’ shadow.</p></div>"|19646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19646-desertshore-migrations-of-glass/|7.2|Jason Heller

For the last decade, the heavy, agile, and inquisitive Swedish punk band has thatched a dozen different influences to its national heritage of D-beat and crustpunk. They’ve incorporated noise rock excess and death metal-like samples, doom metal deliberation and classic rock theatrics, using these pieces to build deliberately outward from a primitive and identifiable foundation. Those sounds speak to the wide, collective résumés of the band’s four members; they’re the pugnacious foil to Sweden’s post-everything <a href=""http://agrimoniasl.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Agrimonia</a>, with whom Martyrdöd shares guitarist Pontus Redig. “I was born in 1982 when Discharge ruled the punk scene,” frontman Mikael Kjellman explained <a href=""http://metalriot.com/news/interview-martyrdod-a-baptism-of-fire/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a recent interview</a>. If that’s where Martyrdöd starts, it’s several decades, styles and choices from where <i>Elddop</i>, their excellent and animated fifth LP, ends. </p>
<p>On <i>Elddop</i>, “Steg” and “Martyren”—its shortest and longest songs, respectively—land back-to-back. As with everything Martyrdöd does, the placement feels more instructive than mere happenstance; in only six minutes, the linked pair offers a complete summary of Martyrdöd’s sound and just how far it may go. “Steg” rips open as a D-beat wrecking ball, the no-nonsense rhythm section goading the hoarse screams of Kjellman like a pack of dogs in pursuit. A minute in, though, the guitars peel away, splitting from the pummel into a race through prismatic twists and turns. It’s a psychedelic smear shot through the base of a 100-second tantrum. But “Martyren” inverts that approach, with twin guitars spiraling over a mid-tempo rhythm section. The bright leads and gleeful solos suggest the inevitable arrival of some vaunted hero. The instrumental indulgence may seem like a preamble, but it lasts for four minutes, longer than most songs in Martyrdöd’s catalogue. Kjellman finally enters as the band picks up and latches down the tempo; he screams a few lines, lets the final word decay in exhaustion, and steps aside for one more resplendent solo. It’s a melodramatic guitar fantasy with a bit of hardcore slipped neatly in toward the end, an exclamation mark that comes before the end of a declarative sentence.</p>
<p>The unfurling triumph of “Martyren” is an exception for Martyrdöd, a group more prone to use crust punk as the core and not the accouterment. Still, it epitomizes the quartet’s quest to do more than turn up the amps, turn on the distortion and bluster through functional forebear mimesis. “Synd” claws through a doom introduction to land squarely in a marching punk marathon, but even at the song’s most ferocious clip, Kjellman and lead guitarist Redig push the limits of what can fit into the space. While one guitar barrels through the riff, the other pirouettes into loops of misdirection; at one point, Kjellman tracks a high-flying solo with his lead, his vocal flexibility showing just how carefully Martyrdöd manages the writing and rendering of these songs.</p>
<p>Even the most straightforward numbers here go at least one step beyond D-beat primacy. “Victoria”, for instance, adds a pop rapport by hanging bright guitars over a belligerent beat, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"">Torche</a> snapping out of the sludge. And though the drums never pull up during “Varningens klockor,” the guitars lace around it, softening the blow with a tone so crisp it seems to jangle. Moments of <i>Elddop </i>hint at the Allman Brothers Band, AC/DC, and Nirvana. Martyrdöd, then, have accepted the spirit and sound of their lineage only on the condition that they’re not limited by it.</p>
<p>What’s most remarkable about <i>Elddop</i> isn’t the extent of the ground it covers, or the amount of memorable choruses and riffs it loads into the trek. Instead, these hyperactive songs never feel enervating or overworked. There are enough changes within these 15 tracks to elicit seasickness, from the stop-and-storm hyperactivity of “Mer skada än nytta” to the flips between chest-pounding hardcore and deep-brooding doom during “Tentakler.” In some sense, every Martyrdöd album has felt that way, but this is the first to pull the reins just enough for the material to be more inquisitive and involving than merely jumpy. What’s more, all of that intricacy never stands in the way of Martyrdöd’s sheer enthusiasm, the quality that makes <i>Elddop</i> so very bracing and breathless. These 15 tracks hit hard, early, and often, but Martyrdöd have become experts at finesse, too. They’re able to buttress the blows with elements that seem unexpected even when they repeat. Call it crust-plus.  </p></div>"|19628.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19628-martyrdod-elddop/|7.8|Grayson Haver Currin

Its province is the damp basement, the dirty aquarium, dreamy half-places of strange light and no easy egress. No surprise that Naomi Punk are from the Pacific Northwest, a region legendarily devoid of sun but graced with persistent, almost prehistoric lushness—somewhere that feels both forbidding and overgrown at the same time.</p>
<p>This is a band with a narrow idea of what it wants to do and a firm confidence in doing it. Most of <i>Television</i>'s songs—and most the songs on 2012's <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17248-the-feeling/""><i>The Feeling</i></a>, for that matter—are slow and grunge-like, anchored by vaguely radioactive-sounding guitars and vocals mumbled to the point of unintelligibility. They are heavy and romantic but sour end-to-end, the ballads of a teenage swamp thing preening in the dark.</p>
<p>They're also unexpectedly pretty, filled with twists of melody and structure far more sophisticated than they need to be to fly in the realms of punk and underground rock. Even on my fourth and fifth listen, I couldn't see all the way to the end of ""Television Man"" or ""Linoleum Tryst #19"", which have the psychedelic quality of a yawn that peels open to yet some improbably bigger yawn, stretching for a resolution always just out of reach.</p>
<p>In that respect, one obvious touchstone is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>, who among other feats wrote noisy, guitar-based rock songs around chord changes so beautiful and labyrinthine that on first listen they somehow seem wrong. (If you haven't listened to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkcJEvMcnEg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lithium""</a> in the past year, treat yourself.) At root, this is basic but deceptively simple stuff about the way two chords can sit next to each other like two familiar flavors paired in some revelatory way. The wit is not in the ingredients, per se, but in the contrast between them.</p>
<p><span>My introduction to Naomi Punk was through </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"" target=""_blank"">Parquet Courts</a><span>' </span><a href=""http://iamtheleastmachiavellian.blogspot.com/2013/10/va-parquet-courts-mixtape-2013.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2013 mixtape</a><span>, which has continued to serve as a reliable map of underground bands marrying the simplicity and aggression of punk with the opacity of ""art,"" by which I generally mean ""things that aren't obvious."" </span><i>Television</i><span> isn't an album I listen to all the time—I value a positive outlook on life—but when I do listen to it, I savor it by the minute. Its style is limited, but the band manages to spread out within it, discovering their own idiosyncratic little vocabulary without ever exhausting it.

They made their debut in 2003, long before their (former) label <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=merge+records"">Merge Records</a> began celebrating anniversaries and even longer before North Carolina was lousy with amazing bands rethinking local and regional musical traditions. During their first decade, they seemed more like one of those boy-girl indie-pop bands, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2700-mates-of-state/"">Mates of State</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10872-places/"">Georgie James</a>, who were more upbeat than catchy. The Rosebuds were founded on the romantic relationship between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31801-howard-ivans/"">Ivan Howard</a> and Kelly Crisp, who formed the group when they started dating, married at the height of their success, and kept it going even when they divorced. 2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15505-loud-planes-fly-low/"">Loud Planes Fly Low</a></i> was a breakup album as reassertion of creative partnership, although their official-ish follow-up to that album was a full-length cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"">Sade</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17464-love-deluxe/"">Love Deluxe</a></i> that barely featured Crisp at all.</p>
<p>Since then, Crisp enrolled at Columbia and moved to New York, while Howard stayed in North Carolina and released a solo-ish single featuring the Spacebomb Studio band (better known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30501-matthew-e-white/"">Matthew E. White</a>’s collective/back-up orchestra). Recently, the duo reconvened at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5976-justin-vernon/"">Justin Vernon</a>’s April Base Studio in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, to record tracks for their sixth (or seventh, depending on how you count) studio album, <i>Sand + Silence</i>. Even if this isn’t their first album together as exes, it still sounds like they’re figuring out what the band is now and how it operates.</p>
<p>And it sounds pretty much like a Howard solo project, with Crisp hanging back. She adds some piano to a few tracks, some backing vocals, and “handclaps”, but the give and take between them, the sense of friction that bolstered <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6889-make-out/"">Make Out</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6891-birds-make-good-neighbors/"">Birds Make Good Neighbors</a></i>, is largely absent on <i>Sand + Silence</i>. Howard indulges genre exercises throughout the album, and his mastery of rock history is impressive, at least for a few songs. Openers and album highlights “In My Teeth” and “Sand + Silence” hinge on intricate earworm choruses and some intriguing rhythmic underpinnings, convincingly updating the ‘70s singer-songwriter mood to the 2010s. It’s part Kenny Loggins, part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3941-steely-dan/"">Steely Dan</a>.</p>
<p>If those don’t seem like the usual touchstones, that may be the point. Much like their superfan/benefactor Vernon, whose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=bonnie+raitt"">Bonnie Raitt</a> and Bruce Hornsby big-ups churned up some hubbub a few years ago, the Rosebuds seem intent on mining historical territory that is largely untouched by most of todays’ indie musicians. Perhaps it’s generational—two veterans drawing inspiration from the music of their own youth—but whatever their motivation, it works well enough and points to a new and arguably more ambitious chapter in the Rosebuds’ career.</p>
<p>But <i>Sand + Silence</i> is built on a sandy, not solid foundation. As the album progresses, the Rosebuds try out all sorts of new ideas but lose all sense of momentum and, ironically, adventure. “Mine Mine Mine” sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8391-george-harrison/"">George Harrison</a> by way of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27688-the-love-language/"">Love Language</a>, with a chorus that grows more grating with each repetition. “Looking For” is sickly-sweet doo-wop that mistakes cutesy for twee, and “Esse Quam Videri” is clumsy prog-based pop that uses the North Carolina state motto as its title (translated from Latin, the phrase means, “To be, rather than to seem (to be)”). It’s not that these experiments don’t quite work or even that they don’t really cohere into much of a statement. The main problem is that the music is so self-conscious, as most of these songs sound like a band still trying to feel its way forward. The quest is noble and even necessary; the results, much less so. </p></div>"|19704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19704-the-rosebuds-sand-silence/|5.1|Stephen M. Deusner

Their first album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18285-twin-peaks-sunken/""><i>Sunken</i></a>, which ran a compact twenty minutes and was as refreshing and ephemeral as a popped Schlitz can, contained hints of both. Their second, <i>Wild Onion</i>, is more than twice the length, in which they seem to be offering two distinct versions of themselves: in one, they're good-times party rockers, and in the other they're heartbroken sweethearts. You could cull down <i>Wild Onion</i> to make one nine-song version of either album, and one would be just okay and one would be really good.</p>
<p>The really good one would be the quieter one, probably: Twin Peaks are better melancholy than they are raucous. The mid-tempo rocker ""Making Breakfast"" has a riff and a wryly rueful air that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9474-tom-petty/"">Tom Petty</a>. ""Mirror of Time"" is a loopy and sweet psychedelic pop song, with a twinkling and watery mix of guitars and a melody like a pinwheel; ""Telephone"" is uptempo but light-footed and soft.</p>
<p>The melodies for their slower and more winsome songs hit harder and soar higher than the power chord explosions, which can feel a little stale, like maybe someone forgot about that Schlitz can. ""Flavor"" sounds suspiciously like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>'s ""Dope Nose"" by way of ""Rock And Roll All Nite."" Their best songwriting flashes the joyful interplay of the guitars—Twin Peaks are the kind of guitar rock band who write riffs and solos you can hum—so the straight power chord stompers cut off their brio, a little bit.</p>
<p>There is one song they write on each record that feels like a next step: on <i>Sunken</i>, it was the chiming ""Irene"", and here it's the cool breeze of ""Ordinary People"", which channels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2304-the-kinks/"">the Kinks</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3179-os-mutantes/"">Os Mutantes</a>. It is a new mode for Twin Peaks; neither heartbroken nor fist-pumping, it's musing, distant, and a little dazed, like a good <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/777-the-clientele/"">Clientele</a> song. Also, like a good Clientele song, it makes you think of rain, whether it's mentioned in the lyrics or not. It is a bemused-thirtysomething song, written by some kids who have barely rounded 20, and it's a fresh testament to their talent.</p></div>"|19515.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19515-twin-peaks-wild-onion/|6.9|Jayson Greene

The music of Leeds-based quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32361-adult-jazz/"">Adult Jazz</a> recalls this (now somewhat unfashionable) approach; their debut album, <i>Gist Is</i>, is full of formally convoluted songs which seldom run shy of five minutes, and feature plenty of brisk, ponderous guitar figures and difficult-to-parse drumbeats. However, the album’s complexity is the brushwork rather than the subject described; a gentle flow of melismatic, often beautiful melody takes center stage and provides the band's compositions with a necessary unifying element.</p>
<p>It’s often easy to discern Adult Jazz's base of contemporary influences. Opener ""Hum"", with its blue-eyed soul aspirations and vocal processing, recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/"">most recent album</a>, while the histrionic vocalizations on more angular and dissonant tracks (""Donne Tongue"", ""Be A Girl"") invites comparisons to like-minded British iconoclasts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts/"">Wild Beasts</a>. However, the band eventually refract and re-contextualize even their most familiar-sounding gestures, leaving room to showcase plenty of their own signature tics. Lead singer Harry Burgess usually doubles or extends his meandering, plainchant-like vocal melodies on guitar rather than providing them with chordal support (on ""Am Gone,"" the technique closely resembles the signature scat-alongs of adult-contemporary jazz favorite George Benson). Meanwhile, the sporadic, acerbic percussion remains affectively detached from the slickness of the rest of the ensemble, and compellingly dense.</p>
<p>There are also jarring interjections from sampled, electro-or-acoustic reeds, horns, strings, harp and vocals—their processed quality sometimes evokes the pitch-shifted trumpet work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Eno</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4025-david-sylvian/"">David Sylvian</a> collaborator and avant-New Ager <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27976-jon-hassel/"">Jon Hassell</a>. However, these gestures provide mere coloration; the base arrangement is always skeletal. Frequently, there are passages of just two or three instruments playing at once, and the full force of the entire ensemble is used sparingly. This allows Adult Jazz to maintain powerfully restrained dynamics when desired, as on the muted “Pigeon Skulls,” which mixes deft, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4221-richard-thompson/"">Richard Thompson</a>-esque acoustic guitar picking with disconnected wisps of vocal melody.</p>
<p>For the most part, Adult Jazz avoid the typical gambits of the post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/452-funeral/""><i>Funeral</i></a> Indie Rock Song; songs end abruptly, like their allotted time is up, without heavy-handed catharsis or blaring, tacked-on codas. The one exception to this is ten-minute album centerpiece “Spook”, which closes with an extended section attempting unsuccessfully to deliver some tom-heavy, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"">Peter Gabriel</a>-esque <i>gravitas</i>. The song’s three or four movements mix somewhat pat chord structures with nondescript vocal licks, and ultimately the track comes across like a jambalaya of undeveloped sketches—juxtaposed without meaningful connective tissue.</p>
<p>Another element of <i>Gist Is</i> that may be initially difficult to stomach is its lyrics<b>,</b> which read something like a collection of Gertrude Stein poems (“Bold claim to taste a feel in felt/ To ham it up, the heart’s a sore/ For babies sake and nothing more”). Sentences sometimes go unfinished, devolving into nonsense and half-words. However, the gibberish often proves to be just as expressive as the cogent language: colorful, motormouth ululations represent Burgess’ addressee “going on and on” in “Am Gone,” and the vocal tracks on “Idiot Mantra” are cleverly scrambled, reversed, or crudely cut off mid-phrase to evoke its eponymous sound. One of Burgess’ discernible themes is the fundamental difficulty and ineffectuality of communication (“It’s all in aphorisms/ I was just believing myself slowly/ And the feeling changed”), so when the band engages in this type of onomatopoeia and word painting, it seems appropriate and makes for some of the album’s most memorable moments.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the primary appeal of Adult Jazz’s music is in its unique and playful syntax, which is neither indulgently collage-like or remotely predictable. Their sound is not revolutionary, but nonetheless wholly distinctive—and nowadays, this seems a hard bargain for any rock band to strike. <i>Gist Is</i> is full of clever turns of musical and lyrical phrase<i> </i>which will dispel possible accusations of self-indulgence and pretension, and somehow, within just a few listens, it becomes easy to enjoy this unusually paced album of so few easy hooks, and so many seemingly insignificant words.</p></div>"|19555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19555-adult-jazz-gist-is/|7.4|Winston Cook-Wilson

After all, some of the best releases in heavy metal history have barely scraped the half hour mark (lest we forget, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"">Slayer</a>’s immortal <i>Reign in Blood</i> screamed by in a scant 29 minutes) but sometimes a 7” just isn’t enough to satiate a listener’s thirst for the raw stuff. When musicians strive to create the most abrasive, alienating sounds possible, shorter formats just make sense. The ornery subsect of black/death metal can be especially taxing on even the most diehard eardrums, which is why releases that clock in on the shorter side inevitably rise to dominance. It’s one of the oldest tenets in show business: leave ‘em wanting more.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Louisiana newcomers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32377-abysmal-lord/"">Abysmal Lord</a> definitely follow the “less is more” doctrine, and perhaps surprisingly, their latest release shows that they take a few other cues from Slayer, too. <i>Storms of Unholy Black Mass</i> is a five-song hellride that just exceeds twenty-six minutes in length and takes heavy cues from war metal godfathers Blasphemy and Impurity while channeling the newer, more cerebral school of occult death metal. The former’s sunglasses-at-night aesthetic is in full force, which is just as well; it gets sunny down in New Orleans, and most of the band originally hails from Alabama, having cut their teeth in the similarly chaotic Grave Ritual. The EP marks their debut following a 2013 rehearsal demo; the lion’s share of <i>Storms of Unholy Black Mass</i> is culled from that demo, but while that statement may lead one to expect an uptick in complexity or recording quality from the embryonic versions, rest assured that the earlier versions’ primal abrasiveness has been retained.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Abysmal Lord is not the kind of band that would benefit from a more polished approach. Rather, their confrontational style depends on the muddy, lightless effect created by the a stripped-down production job and untold layers of distortion and reverb to achieve its vision.  “Terrorist Dawn (Introwehrmacht)” starts off so quietly that one’s instinct is to crank the speakers up, but try to resist the temptation: twenty seconds in, the volume leaps up into an absolute roar, establishing a violent precedent for what’s to come. The aptly titled “Gnashing of Teeth” is a savage affair, as vocalist M.C. garrots his vocal chords into deep inhuman growls and douses the whole pulpy mess in Ross Bay reverb while bashing away at his guitar, backed by understated drums and a throbbing bassline that simmers just below the surface. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The riffs often veer towards workmanlike and wouldn’t leave much to write home about if M.C. didn’t spend time coaxing wild, howling leads from his fretboard like a young and hungry Kerry King. The doomy “Angels of Persecution” dials the tempo back and bogs it down in a thick river of sludge, made all the more foul by those deranged vocals and the fluttering background blasts. Its seven-minute stretch offers a welcome respite from the non-stop onslaught the rest of the album launches, and even gets into an unexpected bout of black metal replete with sharp tremolo. “Storms View” is a weaponized, Slayerized, and pressurized black/death burst with a satisfyingly groovy second half, and the fast and thrashy death metal ripper “Revelation” ties it all together with a near-homage to early Morbid Angel, ghouls and all. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The album whips by in a blinding flash, and despite how well that brevity works in its favor, Abysmal Lord could’ve stood to tack on another song or two, especially if it had given them more room to explore those doomier inclinations. Luckily, there's more than enough time to flip the record over again before their full-length drops.</span></p></div>"|19588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19588-abysmal-lord-storms-of-unholy-black-mass/|6.0|Kim Kelly

When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"">Animal Collective</a> was indie rock’s undisputed, reigning MVP in 2009, a record like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13618-beast-rest-forth-mouth/""><i>Beast Rest Forth Mouth </i></a>could elevate a promising prospect to All-Star status: there was a demand for bands that were percussive and electronic with some basis in rock-band composition, bearing boyish vocals that were still handsome and masculine. The Brooklyn-via-Atlanta trio, like most in their position, got more urbane and technophilic on their follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16440-bear-in-heaven-i-love-you-its-cool/""><i>I Love You, It’s Cool</i></a>, a solid record but also a holding pattern that established staying power at the sake of artistic momentum. Animal Collective's 2012 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16980-centipede-hz""><i>Centipede Hz</i></a> clearly signaled the end of an indie rock era, so Bear in Heaven have more incentive and maybe even a necessity to define themselves on their own terms. And in a way, <i>Time Is Over One Day Old</i> does that—if you've kept up with them to this point, you know it’s Bear in Heaven that you're listening to—but while they remain difficult to describe, in this context, it’s for less flattering reasons. In 2014, it's hard to say what makes Bear in Heaven stand out.</p>
<p>As it turns out, that still makes <i>Time Is Over One Day Old</i> easy to categorize—as with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5506-yeasayer"">Yeasayer</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29244-hooray-for-earth"">Hooray For Earth</a>’s most recent releases, it’s a notable example of a band ostensibly trying to figure out where they fit in as festival-going indie fans have simultaneously embraced more esoteric material alongside the most overt pop and R&amp;B. So <i>Time Is Over One Day Old</i> comes across as being not quite centrist enough to qualify as pop, but nowhere near experimental enough to appeal to the fringe. In the current state, Bear in Heaven’s left-of-center translates to “middle of the road.”</p>
<p>Of all the things <i>Time Is Over One Day Old</i> strips away from Bear in Heaven, foremost is the upward propulsion. The tone of the band's rhythm section is strapping and muscular, yet most of these songs begin by finding a cruising speed and end with Bear in Heaven having maintained a straight line throughout. Upon arriving at their choruses, “Time Between” and “Memory Heart” are given the chance to take the same thrilling leap as “Lovesick Teenagers” and “Ultimate Satisfaction”, but they politely demur and step back. “If I Were to Lie” and “Demons” bear interesting texture and try to work up same perpetual motion as “The Reflection of You”, but they end up simply running in place.</p>
<p>Even in their earliest days, Bear in Heaven were more economical and precise than their peers, so it’s not surprising that their leanest album yet reveals what often amounts to a prim and trim krautrock band. Jon Philpot’s diction is clean and legible, his melodies are clearly enunciated, and opener “Autumn” sounds like a distant, colorless cousin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou"">Caribou</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1805-the-milk-of-human-kindness/""><i>The Milk of Human Kindness</i></a>. When Bear in Heaven steer off-track, the results are intriguing but unrealized: “Time Between” attaches itself to an alt-hip-hop beat distractingly similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10413-lenny-kravitz/"">Lenny Kravitz</a>’s “Fly Away”, and halfway through “They Dream”, Bear in Heaven veer off into a beatless coda that stops <i>Time</i> completely. When “Way Off” and “Dissolve the Walls” make similar moves toward the record’s closure, Bear in Heaven sound like they're running on fumes.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Time Is Over One Day Old</i> knows how to fill a room. It’s tasteful, electronic indie as ambient music, and when you lean into it, it rarely pushes back<span>. T</span>he evenness of Philpott’s delivery ensures that lines such as “You told me lies and I believed you”, “Suicide or stay alive...you decide to stay alive hopeless as a virgin”, and “Holy cluster fuck, you love a lot” all register at the same level of impact. Meanwhile, the uncanny, luminous production of “The Sun and the Moon and the Stars” puts it at odds with Philpot muttering with stony casualness, “the sun and the moon and the stars are hanging out with me.” <span>On </span><i>Time Is Over One Day Old, </i><span>any emotional extreme or attempted musical shift just ends up</span><span> sounding like stasis.</span></p></div>"|19582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19582-bear-in-heaven-time-is-over-one-day-old/|5.9|Ian Cohen

Frontman Dan McGee’s words have had a whiskey-slouch to them ever since the band's 2007 debut, <i>A Celebration of Hunger</i>. It could spring from his North Carolina clime, but there’s a Southern gothic bent to Spider Bags that separates them from a lot of American garage fare. McGee gives a leery eye to all there is to love; he whips dry vitriol and broken-hearted balladry into roadhouse punk songs that sound like they’re barely hanging together. This is part of the fun of listening to any Spider Bags song, as they cause you to ask to yourself, “Might this whole thing crumble into a pile of dirt and rust?”</span><span> </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Over the years, things congealed more and more, which culminated in their most cohesive work to date, the 2012 album <span class=""s2""><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16910-shake-my-head/"">Shake My Head</a>. </i></span>That album was crammed with life, skipping around from shit-kicker fuzz to psych freak guitar solos while keeping the twangy energy up the whole way through. It follows that <i>Frozen Letter</i> is a bit of a comedown, drunk on its own sound; McGee, aged and with two kids under his roof, sounds utterly windburned by life. </span><span class=""s1"">It’s their first record for Merge, which means <i>Frozen Letter </i>is easily their most hi-fi record yet—but the band takes on a more skeletal sound regardless. It was recorded in just three days, but it sounds a bit less dangerous, and a bit more inscrutable, than their past releases. </span><span> </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The band split <i>Frozen Letter</i> into two divergent sections, as the first four tracks kick-up all this dirt only to have it idly settle as the album winds on. It has the shape and feel of a sturdy ‘70s classic rock record, swirling with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2304-the-kinks/"">the Kinks</a>' charm and the strutter of early AC/DC. The guitars, the vocals, and the lyrics are flayed and bony, more exposed than ever before, which works both for and against the band.  </span><i>Frozen Letter</i> is at its best when McGee plays sweet and direct as on “Back With You Again In The World”, an ode to a love as simple as the fired-up Dixie shuffle they take up. When he taps into the morose, self-pitying spirit of Hank Williams on the ballad in the back half of the album, “Walking Bubble”, his words tumble out with ease, turning out a beautiful phrase like ”There aren't enough words in a day for a man like me” with the ease of flipping a blade of wheat grass from one side of the mouth to the other. </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The record is filled with little moments that pop—the guitars that scream at the end of “We Got Problems” and their cover of Texas rocker/drifter John Wesley Coleman’s “Summer of ’79” are two big highlights—but in between are long, vexing stretches of inertia. Spider Bags used to play through the bitterness and the malaise, but on <i>Frozen Letter</i> it sometimes sounds like they're surrendering to them instead. The album title itself comes from ""Coffin Car”, where McGee imagines a frozen letter jutting out of the ground, then strolls about for five minutes detailing oblique visions of grey horses, curtained rooms, and shiny smokestacks. This, like much of the record, doesn’t build a song so much as it does a series of Rorschach splotches.

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As the record closes with the too-fried psych “Eyes Of Death”, it's clear that <i>Frozen Letter</i> exudes ambition without having accomplished much.

There's a limp, mostly-constructed skeleton of a great rock record here, and maybe that's exactly what it's meant to be. So what Spider Bags do here isn't as thrilling as their previous efforts, which left listeners on the edge of your seat, wondering if everything would fall apart.

It’s a punk pub, and on any given night, you’re as likely to see a wizened Oi! band like Angelic Upstarts as you are to see a gaunt, bald man with an acoustic guitar strumming a harrowing cover of Townes Van Zandt’s “Lungs”. They serve food, as long as you consider a packet of Tayto crisps to be dinner. In the men’s room, the walls are thickly plastered—not with gig flyers or snot, but with a yellowing pantheon of superheroes cut out of old Jack Kirby comics. </p>
<p>It’s the kind of place you could easily imagine The #1s playing in, and sure enough, <a href=""http://harmlessnoise.ie/2013/11/interview-the-1s/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">they sometimes do</a>. The power-pop foursome have been kicking around the Dublin scene for a couple of years now, although members of the band also play in various other groups like Cheap Freaks, the Pacifics, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15618-doubles/"">Cian Nugent</a> &amp; the Cosmos. But The #1s’ self-titled debut album marks the point where this scene may start to get noticed a bit more: it's more ambitious and unabashedly brilliant than four modest walls can contain.</p>
<p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user3105090/the-number-ones-heartsmash"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Heartsmash”</a> is the album’s lead single, and it couldn’t have been better plucked from the pack. A stuttering drum beat similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"">the Strokes</a>’ “Hard to Explain” launches it off, but from there the song takes a gleeful belly-flop backward into the classic power-pop era of the late 1970s. The #1s hail from the Republic of Ireland, but they not-so-secretly owe a big debt to Northern Ireland’s bouncy punk scene from 35 years ago—in particular, the groups <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-pIEWA572A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rudi</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFzTA5rbAj4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Protex</a>, and naturally the Undertones. Instead of leaning on the default setting of The Undertones’ “Teenage Kicks” phase, though, “Heartsmash” is more in tune with that band's 1980 effort <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNu44Rtev2E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hypnotised</a></i>: still bratty, but less frantic, and with a self-awareness that revels in its own lovesick ache. Guitarist Seán Goucher sings in a sugary, swooning yelp, then he screams like his leg got caught in a trap. Tenderness and desperation collide and combine, thrillingly.</p>
<p>The #1s' songs are simple on the surface, but a sophisticated sense of craft lurks beneath the popped pimples and crumpled beer cans. On “Sharon Shouldn’t”—one of four album tracks that appeared in less evolved forms on prior cassette and 7” releases—singer/guitarist Eddie Kenrick takes the lead, his voice more clear and keening than Goucher’s heart-in-throat croon. Melodies drift fluidly through rapid-pulse riffs. Minor chords whizz by, microbursts of melancholy that add dimension but never threaten to drag, and that goes double for “Boy” and its back-to-back sequel, “Girl”. The first is a fizzy, tinny tribute to garage-pop rawness buoyed by Nugent’s bubbly bass runs; the second is a ballad awash in wobbly romanticism and a piercing sense of helpless chivalry.</p>
<p>The dynamic is giddy, and it evokes something even more gut-punching, as this is music for the mood swings that come with the onset of chronic love. The hooks sink deep, and they cling with all their might. It’s a continuum that stretches from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/522-buzzcocks/"">Buzzcocks</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1385-the-exploding-hearts/"">the Exploding Hearts</a>, on to more recent proponents such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLJkc14cbio"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Something Fierce</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12256-gentleman-jesse-his-men/"">Gentleman Jesse</a>. The #1s are the greenest of the lot, but they’ve been around the power-pop block long enough to know the best spots to stop in for a good pint and a good cry.</p>
<p>Power-pop comes and goes in a cycle that’s about as long as a doe-eyed freshman’s transformation into an oh-so-weary senior. At heart, though, the genre’s best bands bottle the most ephemeral substance imaginable—youth—and pickle it to perfection. They make lust, discovery, and impulsive desire resonate not just with young people, but with anyone who’s ever considered themselves in any way young. Power-pop quite often seems sickly saccharine; don’t trust it if it doesn’t. But great power-pop is sweet and sour at the same time, an alchemy of new hormones and old souls. The #1s know this in their bones, and their album is a master class in that eternal truth. It zings and zooms with all the pop-art spunk of a pub wall papered in cut-up comic books: faded and tattered but still fantastically bright.</p></div>"|19516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19516-the-1s-the-1s/|7.9|Jason Heller

The Tokyo singer-songwriter’s latest album, <i>Ice Cream Man</i>, is his 15th original full-length, and it marks no major sonic changes from what preceded it. It’s an up-tempo album taking cues from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/682-the-cardigans/"">the Cardigans</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16161-aztec-camera/"">Aztec Camera</a>, and countless other European pop acts, filled with lyrical references to the English Premier League and various EU nations. Kaji long ago carved out his ideal sound, and <i>Ice Cream Man</i> serves as more of a good gateway into his body of work more than anything else.</p>
<p>Such a gateway is necessary, though, because Kaji has always been slept on outside of his home country. In the Western world, he’s either best known for the song “Tokyo to London” which found him dueting with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"">Saint Etienne</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/850-sarah-cracknell/"">Sarah Cracknell</a>—or for becoming a “news of the weird” item in 2009 after being mugged in Sweden while dressed as a pineapple for a video shoot. In Japan, however, he played a large role in the 1990s Shibuya-kei movement, a genre-and-decades-blending scene that saw the likes of Pizzicato Five and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/832-cornelius/"">Cornelius</a> (who released much of Kaji’s music via his Trattoria imprint) bum-rush domestic charts and build cult followings outside of the scene.</p>
<p>Shibuya-kei is now mostly a memory, Cornelius has recently been soundtracking anime, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/759-cibo-matto/"">Cibo Matto</a> chase nostalgia-fueled attention—yet Kaji persists in keeping the indie-pop-derived sound alive, along with its globe-trotting aesthetic. He’s always been fascinated by Europe and its culture—his nickname is “Mr. Sweden,” still trumpeted in press materials despite him being beat up there—and some of <i>Ice Cream Man</i>’s most rollicking moments come when he’s indulging in it. “Happy Manchester” shuffles forwards on guitar and piano, giving Kaji plenty of space to sing about the titular city in a surreal way, wherein assorted legends from the Manchester United soccer team roam the streets (“Over there!/ Giggs and Scholes drink ginger ale”). “Brand New Boots and Panties” references <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9484-ian-dury/"">Ian Dury</a> in the title, but nabs lines from London club Chelsea’s “Blue Is The Colour” anthem.</p>
<p><i>Ice Cream Man</i> is at its best when it embraces its role as a summer-focused album, as Kaji delivers skippy indie-pop songs centered on sweet choruses. “Jam &amp; Butter Song” and “Summer Camp” are driving numbers that find Kaji and his backing band play at a fast clip, which allows them to quickly arrive at the easy-breezy hooks. Opener “Tropical Girl” sweetens this formula up by adding horn blurts and bongos, making for the album's most season-appropriate cut; the title track tries out ‘50s-inspired bubblegum pop, and its unflinching commitment to the concept pays off in a silly-yet-memorable way.</p>
<p><i>Ice Cream Man</i> sputters when Kaji slows down, which he does a bit too often. The skip of “Life Goes On” and “Rainy City” are almost salvaged by trumpet flourishes and jazzy organ, respectively, but they both still come off as sleepy compared to the rest of the album. The meditative acoustic strum of “Pool Side Calling”, especially, is less a breather from the uptempo songs that surround it and more of a total brakes-screeching ballad. Every album Kaji has released in the past decade, though, has possessed these types of moments. The bulk of his post-‘90s output has resembled a more polished version of what he did during the boom days of Shibuya-kei, and <i>Ice Cream Man</i> is, at its best, another worthy record in his long-running career.</p></div>"|19661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19661-hideki-kaji-ice-cream-man/|6.5|Patrick St. Michel

Stuart Dahlquist of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24526-asva/"">Asva</a>, formerly of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>, Goatsnake, and Burning Witch. Fans looking for a Phelps and/or Dahlquist solo project, in which one musician’s artistic vision and strengths are jettisoned to elevate the other’s, will be disappointed. But open-minded fans and patient, uninitiated listeners will be rewarded, as DAMA/LIBRA is a partnership that’s artfully smudged with the fingerprints of both of its participants.<br/><br/>DAMA/LIBRA’s experimental meditations are heavy, though not in the typical sense. Dahlquist is known mostly for doom metal, and DAMA/LIBRA's sound certainly doesn't traffic in that genre—but connecting the dots between his former bands and DAMA/LIBRA isn’t <i>too</i> much of a stretch. Dahlquist is using different tools here, particularly organ, chimes, bells, and lots of open space; distorted guitar shows up only briefly on “The Chant” and again in a vampy outro for “Only Medicine”. <i>Claw</i>’s low rumbles and drones are doom-y in their own way and best heard loudly. It’s bizarre, enthralling and unlike anything I’ve heard in a while—like two guys playing a less world-y version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1030-dead-can-dance/"">Dead Can Dance</a> in an empty church.<br/><br/>Closing track “Thine” is the piece that first brought Dahlquist and Phelps together; it initially existed as an instrumental collaboration between Asva and French artist Philippe Petit. After hearing the track, Phelps reached out to Dahlquist and asked if he could add some vocals, which he did, dividing the song into three stanzas: “Stolen, sleeping, broken, thine,” “Stolen, pardon, mercy, mercy,” and “wake, shine, always, rise.” Dahlquist said the final result of “Thine” nearly brought he and his wife to tears, and the piece's redemptive progression is certainly noticeable. Phelps has often become synonymous with hopeful catharsis, as heard on <i>Gala</i>, the 2013 release from Joel RL Phelps &amp; the Downer Trio, or on his contributions to <a href=""http://songsmolina.bandcamp.com/album/songs-molina-a-benefit-compilation-for-jason-molinas-survivors"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Songs: Molina</i></a>, a benefit compilation “for Jason Molina’s survivors.” His songs are soaked in almost-KOs and their resuscitative aftermaths.</p>
<p>Without Phelps, much of <i>Claw</i> would sound like hymns for the doomed, and that wouldn’t be all bad. Some tracks play to those strengths (“Destroy”, the lyric-less, thunder-clapping “Death Rattle”). But Phelps is taking these hymns for the doomed and turning them into survival canticles for the day after doomsday, when the dust has settled and you realize that maybe it wasn’t doomsday after all. <br/><br/>It doesn’t take much digging into the personal lives of Phelps and Dahlquist to make some educated guesses about <i>Claw</i>’s inspirations, even though the lyrics are vague enough that they could point to many things. Given Phelps’ openness about his <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/blog/joel-rl-phelps-on-overcoming-addiction-and-new-album-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">struggles with alcohol addiction</a>, it’s probably not a stretch to apply much of <i>Claw</i>’s hopefulness to his sobriety. Plus, Dahlquist and Phelps have known each other for 25 years, along the way sharing tragedies like the death of Dahlquist’s brother Michael, the Silkworm drummer who was the victim of a woman’s failed vehicular suicide attempt in 2005. Those are some long, deeply intertwined roots, which undoubtedly helped bridge the distance gap as the two emailed files back and forth between British Columbia and Seattle while putting the record together. <br/><br/>The downside to Phelps’ cathartic tendencies and off-kilter vocal style is that he sometimes misses his mark. In a more traditional rock group like the Downer Trio, the notes he doesn’t quite hit become part of a larger package; with DAMA/LIBRA, the straining and reaching beyond his register work on songs like “Boy, Dock”—the prettiest, most hymn-like on <i>Claw</i>—and “Been to the Water,” probably the only song you’ll find yourself humming later. But on “Only Medicine” Phelps’ reedy sliding and stretching can be grating, and when he beckons the guitars with a yell of “Welcome to the niiiight,” it feels like a failed attempt at sounding metal. Still, none of those moments ruin any song entirely, nor this adventurous record as a whole. A few sour notes is a fair tradeoff for a sound this fresh.</p></div>"|19583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19583-damalibra-claw/|7.1|Joel Oliphint

They're stealing our privacy, our convictions, the very essence of our being, and leaving behind little more than a ""for sale"" sign and some vague, constant hollowness. In music, a dwindling whirlpool of funds only spurs on these parasites as they scavenge for scraps of humanity wherever ears can hear. Their thirst is real. And artists—those blasphemous and holy conduits for truth, liberty, and whatever else is missing from our lives—can't help but succumb. To last more than 20 years in rock'n'roll without sacrificing a lethal amount of one's soul requires a certain vigilance; to navigate around the pitfalls of both punk and ambition without tripping-up on either can seem just as hard as making a great album. But Spoon, one of the most stand-up bands of their generation, have figured all of this out. On their eighth album, they laugh in the face of leeches, defy gravity, suspend time. ""All they want's my soul, yes, yes, I know!"" hollers Britt Daniel, stretching every crevice of his 43-year-old throat. His message is clear: They can't have it.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Spoon's soul is theirs alone. It's not James Brown's soul, and though Daniel was raised Christian in conservative small-town Texas, it's not God's soul, either. It's not exactly classic rock, not quite post-punk. It's not the soul of indie idealists blindly conflating modesty and virtue. Instead, this band is about capturing the unknown—those ""finer feelings,"" as Daniel once put it—and simply letting it float. Many of their songs are meticulously crafted, but they also breathe and break with crackling spontaneity. Theirs is an in-between soul happily seeking limbo as its own destination. It's manly in an old-fashioned way, but still scuffed-up and vulnerable. It's allergic to empty sentiment. It's smart but not eggheaded, tough but not dumb. It's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"">Costello</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"">Lennon</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">the Cure</a>. It's all-knowing and hopelessly fallible, mysterious with a purpose. It's going to be crushed by life and love, and it's going to endure. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>They Want My Soul</i> is the quintet's most booming LP, eons ahead of their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a>-worshipping beginnings and a far cry from the relatively small-scale charm of their early-2000s touchstones <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7429-girls-can-tell/""><i>Girls Can Tell</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7428-kill-the-moonlight/""><i>Kill the Moonlight</i></a>, as well as their self-consciously lo-fi 2010 record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13839-transference/""><i>Transference</i></a>. The album sounds like a proper follow-up to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10390-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga/""><i>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</i></a>, the clear-eyed 2007 LP where everything clicked into place and a restless band finally hammered themselves into stone. Some of the new record's sonic forthrightness comes courtesy of two indie-hit-making producers new to Spoon's world: über-pro Joe Chiccarelli, who's worked with everyone from Frank Zappa to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"">the Shins</a> to Jazon Mraz over the last 35 years, and psychedelic guru Dave Fridmann, who's helped turn unapologetic weirdos <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">Flaming Lips</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"">MGMT</a> into festival headliners. Spoon, who also co-produced every song on the album, lie somewhere between those two poles—pop and outré—and the triangulations happening throughout <i>They Want My Soul </i>flow out unencumbered. These songs rip and burst and <i>go</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As guitar rock continues its slow and inevitable transition into a bygone art, <i>They Want My Soul </i>pulls at familiar threads, fraying things to make them seem now, if not new. There's an inherent nostalgia in the kind of alchemy Spoon are mixing up here, and the band is wise enough not to shy away from it. But instead of glowing in the light of good times past, <i>They Want My Soul </i>is constantly negotiating with the memories that make up our minds, trying to decide if they're traps or blessings. ""Do You"" plays it both ways, starting off with Daniel wistfully reminiscing about vomiting on a curb—""I was half out of a bag,"" he grins—before zooming out with a succinct world-weariness that comes from chronicling humanity's small giveaways for more than two decades: ""You tiptoe for ages, but lose yourself/ Flippin' back pages, unbuckling belts."" Daniel <a href=""http://www.rookiemag.com/2013/12/theme-song-britt-daniel/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has talked about</a> how he was a ""mean and ornery"" teenage outcast, and much of his subsequent years have been spent wearing-down that sharpness with empathy while trying to retain bits of its hard-nosed rigor. On the barrelling ""Rainy Taxi"", he has trouble living in the greys, describing an all-or-nothing romance he can't help but fall for. ""When you stand beside me I feel something stronger than I ever could,"" he says with hope, before the ultimatum: ""But if you leave you better run away for good."" A happy ending is a boring ending.</p>
<p class=""p3"">And who wants an ending anyway? ""Inside Out"" finds submissive contentment amidst a drift that hints at eternity. ""There's intense gravity in you,"" Daniel lilts, ""I'm just your satellite."" And then the track willingly enters that ether as koi-pond synths twinkle in the distance, its tranquility tempered by the fact that Spoon have never made a song quite this pretty before. So have Spoon gone soft? Have they been watered-down by commercially-minded collaborators? Have they crushed the DIY dream by <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6099244/spoon-loma-vista-label-deal-new-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">leaving</a> indie utopia label Merge? <i>They Want My Soul </i>makes such questions sound about as petty and irrelevant as the thousands of bands that have come and gone (or come, gone, and reunited) since Daniel and drummer Jim Eno started Spoon in the months just before Kurt Cobain's death. They didn't burn out. They're not fading away.</p></div>"|19514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19514-spoon-they-want-my-soul/|8.6|Ryan Dombal

That’s a horrible thing to say about an artist, even when meant with the best intentions, yet there it is: you can pick up any of Kilgour’s releases over the years and be assured, within a small margin of variance, that the music on said release will be jangly, charming, unassuming hummable, and non-cloyingly cozy. His latest, lovely solo album, <i>End Times Undone</i>, is no different. But in this case—as with all his more recent albums—consistency and reliability do not necessarily mean stagnancy and complacency.</p>
<p>For one thing, <i>End Times Done</i> isn’t all jangle. Bucking the reductive Dunedin Sound stereotype, but not too radically, the album bobs on a sea of distorted swirl and psychedelic drift. “Like Rain” has all the languorous aggression and romanticized gloom of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"">Jesus and Mary Chain</a>—including a couple licks of vocal melody that seem like nods to “Just Like Honey”—only rendered in a bursts of stained-glass-filtered sunlight. In the most panoramic way possible, “Crow” evokes vintage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5033-neil-young-crazy-horse/"">Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse</a>, a veritable horse’s skeleton of a song, all sun-bleached bones and sandblasted, single-note leads. That motif of dreamy Americana resurfaces in “Comin’ On”, an exploration of the admittedly narrow overlap between <i>Loaded</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">Velvet Underground</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"">R.E.M.</a>’s formative twang.</p>
<p>Kilgour is a cultural institution in his native New Zealand, but his vista has always been much broader. In that sense, he’s a kindred spirit to fellow NZ-born songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13962-dean-wareham/"">Dean Wareham</a>—and whether it’s synchronicity or something more premeditated, there’s something <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"">Galaxie 500</a>-like to “Dropper”. Kilgour’s keening voice slices through a druggy fog, and his monstrously blown-out guitar solo winds its way through the song like a disembodied earthquake. That dynamic drops with a sharp intake of breath on “I Don’t Want to Live Alone”: “She’s got trees in her head/ Dancing trees in her head”, sings Kilgour over a playfully shambolic keyboard vamp. Limber and loose, it’s the album’s best ventilated moment—and when the song ultimately disintegrates, it’s like a child who finds himself abruptly bored with his toy.</p>
<p>Kilgour’s history as a songwriter is considerable, but he never seems obsessed with it. <i>End Times Undone</i> is a record that, like his best work, exists in the interminable, indefinable now—a rapturous purgatory of memory, images, and slippery wisps of emotion. It’s as anti-ego as music gets, and that’s always been one of the most beautiful things about Kilgour’s songs, a virtue that makes his steady consistency less of a hindrance and more of an aesthetic quirk. His ability to barely change is one of the most intriguing things about him—and that’s never been more evident than in <i>End Times Done</i>’s high point, “Some Things You Don’t Get Back”. Foregoing jangle in favor of slashing strum, the song comes on pensive but never goes over the melancholic cliff. In some ways, it feels like a celebration. Some things you don’t get back because you <i>shouldn’t</i> get them back. That’s a good thing.

He's always shrouded in dry ice and purple lights, his hair bleached blonde; on the album insert for his latest album, <i>Fan Fiction</i>, he's leaning coolly on a Roland synthesiser. Without knowing the first note, you can already hear the plastic click of a drum machine.</p>
<p class=""p2""><i>Fan Fiction </i>continues the sonic retro-futurism of his solo debut <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/geoffreyoconnor/sets/geoffrey-oconnor-vanity-is"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Vanity Is Forever</i></a>, as O'Connor layers chintzy, thin-sounding synths over reverberating disco guitars, guiding it all with his breathy, nasal whine. Every dazzling melody is sandwiched together, maximalist and swollen in a dizzying spectacle. Even when O'Connor slows it down, there's too much going on to feel truly settled. O'Connor counterbalances, or maybe accentuates, his dark lyrical matter with lusty 4/4 rhythms. On some tracks, like early single ""Jacqueline"", it's easy to mistake a sense of lyrical tragedy for a good time, but <i>Fan Fiction</i>'s core conceit lies in asking you whether they're mutually exclusive after all.</p>
<p class=""p1"">O'Connor frequently nods backwards in time, but he's also part of a contemporary moment in Australian music. Fellow <a href=""http://chaptermusic.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chapter</a> acts like polymath Darren Sylvester and leather-daddies <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31335-standishcarlyon/"">Standish/Carlyon</a>, as well as recent <a href=""http://www.remotecontrolrecords.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Remote Control</a> signees Client Liaison, are all gauzy embodiments of arch seduction, turbo-capitalist production, and indulgence. In the New Australian New Wave, corporate culture is mined for aesthetic value, yuppies are the new hipsters, and nihilism has been usurped by the possibility offered by wealth.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But O'Connor's power moves are just the shadow cast by his burning submissiveness. It's clear that the relationships he details are built on addiction instead of trust, so <i>Fan Fiction </i>portrays O'Connor as helplessly willing, a wretch begging for punishment if it means at least one night with someone. ""Please"" finds him begging a woman to take the frustration of her failed relationship out on him, while ""Another Time"" is verb-heavy and overwrought, reading like erotic fiction. ""My Greatest Hit"" uses the triple-entendre of junkie dialect, music industry jargon, and PUA grossness to go full-on stalker, while ""Into My Hands"" praises O'Connor's target of obsession as the final miracle. On album closer ""Centre of the Room"", O'Connor swirls sex and death into destiny and gulps it down—a mortal resignation which, given the album's sequencing, seems all too appropriate.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On <i>Fan Fiction, </i>O'Connor is drowning in his nymphomania, and the only time he kicks against the tide and shows a little agency is on ""Giving It Away"", in which he casts off the trappings of a previous relationship. The notion that personal heartbreak is more epic and unknowable than any heartbreak that came before it is a common delusion, but that just reinforces O'Connor's cretinism. The woman in ""Her Name On Every Tongue"" enraptures every boy she meets, hiding anxiety behind charisma; on ""Please"", a female target has been ruined by 12 years of ""the same clumsy fuck.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">O'Connor also describes her having sex with said clumsy fuck as ""playing dead"", which could just as well describe all the characters on <i>Fan Fiction</i>. Although there are hints of personality traits that occasionally shine through, the characters detailed throughout largely seem like they've been robbed of their own lives, prisms through which O'Connor can examine those hidden impulses. And so O'Connor makes himself into the villain, or at least the antagonist, of his own work, and <i>Fan Fiction </i>never suggests that any of this is admirable or contemptible—it just <i>is</i>.</p></div>"|19529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19529-geoffrey-oconnor-fan-fiction/|7.4|Jake Cleland

It’s almost too perfect that the Indiana trio called their last album </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16893-bubblegum-graveyard/"">Bubblegum Graveyard</a></i><span> and adorned it with a </span><i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_the_Crypt_(comics)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tales From the Crypt</a></i><span>-style zombie cartoon–their music often sounds like '60s DIY pop rising from its own ashes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Yet unlike a lot of retro-styled groups, there’s not much nostalgia going in Apache Dropout’s music. Their simple tunes and the earnest way they bash them out suggest they see the past not as an escape, but a source of fuel. They tap into the gut-level immediacy of garage rock in order to make their music sound present. In this way, they share a sensibility with the many retro-tinted groups </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6140-ian-svenonius/"">Ian Svenonius</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> has fronted, but without his sly commentary.

<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Immediacy is the most distinguishing characteristic of their third album, </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>Heavy Window</i></span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">. Their 2011 self-titled </span><a href=""http://apachedropout.bandcamp.com/album/apache-dropout"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">debut</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> was a bit more primitive, and </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Bubblegum Graveyard </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">perhaps had sharper songs—but Apache Dropout has never sounded as fiery as they do in these 11 tracks spread across a hectic 34 minutes. They open with Blood's trademark screech, and from then on rarely stop to breathe, chugging and churning through every three-chord cycle and one-two stomp like they have a curfew. The speed varies, but the urgency is constant, and the sound is more combustible now too: Blood’s sandpaper guitar and Anu Nath's fur-lined bass rub together like kindling, shooting off sparks at every turn.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">That combination lights up so often that it threatens to immolate the album; “Tired Old Story” actually descends into pure fuzz, burying drums and vocals beneath a wall of flame. But Apache Dropout follow that with their snappiest tune, “Crystal Ball”, feeding off of Lord Frye’s two-slap drumming and a flourish of acoustic strums. Finding those kind of momentum shifts inside such a well-defined sound makes </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Heavy Window </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">more than a one-shot energizer. Garage rock records often lose their juice after repeat plays like, well, overchewed bubblegum. But Apache Dropout know how to find new paths even while sprinting. You won’t hear anything besides garage here, but inside those confines you’ll hear a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Still, nothing Apache Dropout does is likely to convert the garage-averse. But the funny thing is, when </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>Heavy</i> <i>Window</i>’s </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">playing, I’m not thinking this is great garage rock–I’m just thinking it’s great music, and that jibes with Apache Dropout’s smart take on the past. They use it for what they need rather than getting lost in it for its own sake, making music that points to itself more than its influences. Some retro-sounding records are good examples of a time or a sound, but </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Heavy Window </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">is a lot more direct than that.</span></p></div>"|19530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19530-apache-dropout-heavy-window/|7.2|Marc Masters

David Blair Stiffler, a veteran documenter of uncommon sounds for the Folkways label, took a small crew into remote mountain regions of the country on three separate occasions spanning 1986-88, ultimately getting kidnapped at gunpoint and held for 18 days on their final journey. Incredibly, as documented in the liner notes on this release, Stiffler simply carried on recording while in captivity, although many of those works were confiscated by the rebel faction who abducted them. Despite such bravery, these recordings have never surfaced before, with the passing of Folkways head Moses Asch preventing their release at the time, and the reliable <a href=""http://www.numerogroup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Numero Group</a> now picking up the pieces many decades later.</p>
<p>Like the best recordings of their type, Stiffler’s work here gives a strong sense of place. The natural world around the musicians is as important an ingredient as the instruments and vocals of the musicians he encountered. His use of space is important, too. On one track, simply titled “Man Whistling”, the recording takes in every breath of its player, making it feel like you're about three feet away while it was being played. Elsewhere, acres of room expand outward—on “Lullaby” the instrumentation is so distant it sounds like it’s a different song, being played somewhere else, in another time entirely. Sometimes chatter drifts in and out of the mix, or leaves crunch underfoot. It’s an interesting juxtaposition to the playing, which is often taut and disciplined. The ensemble of gong players that opens up the album makes it arresting right from the beginning, with tension and pace gathering quickly then loosening at the close.</p>
<p>While working through <i>Mountain Provinces</i> it helps to have Stiffler’s liner notes to hand, to provide a sense of journey as he ghosts through various regions on his journey. He points out the political turmoil in the Philippines in 1986, discusses how these cultures struggled to maintain their identity at the time, and sets the scene by describing it as a mix of “spectacular landscapes and a cultural heritage of blood feuds and head hunting.” There are distinct phases to the record, with the July 1988 trip, for example, focussing on throat singers and other vocalists in a region around where <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Apocalypse Now</i></a> was filmed. It’s appropriate they landed in a location once deemed filmic, as the problems around <i>Mountain Provinces</i> give it the air of something like Werner Herzog’s <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083946/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Fitzcarraldo</i></a>, which focuses on the struggle to pull a huge ship over a Peruvian mountain. Stiffler’s battle was more internalized but no less difficult, as he exited the region with recordings lost, his life just about intact, and with no end product to show until now.</p>
<p>Moods shift dramatically across the pieces Stiffler and his team managed to capture, from the light and airy trio of “Bamboo Zither” songs to the positively doomy “Group Singing with Gongs”. On the latter there’s an air of creeping tension, a feeling perhaps easy to ascribe from an outsider's perspective when bearing in mind the political strife in the region at the time, but certainly hard not to notice as a cacophony of discordant gongs builds over its ragged course. Most striking is one of the few recordings to remain from Stiffler’s bout of captivity, which features a woman singing a lullaby to her baby. There’s tenderness and fear in her voice, especially when it descends into bouts of un-language, where the woman simply hums the melody of the song and her inflections beautifully rise and fall.</p>
<p>Although Stiffler’s liner notes to this compilation are reasonably comprehensive, still some holes remain in the stories surrounding these songs. Mostly, we don’t get to find out how long they have been around, or how off-the-cuff the performances are. Some are undoubtedly songs passed down through generations, but whether they pick up different shades and colors as the times change remains a mystery. One such track, named “Rice Winnowing Song”, bears a dream-like quality, rendered by the layering of the women’s voices throughout. On “Rice Winnowing Song” it’s easy to drift off and forget the world, just as it’s easy to imagine the world impinging rather more heavily on material that becomes torn around the edges. The broad range of feelings captured is what gives <i>Music from the Mountain Provinces</i> its strength—this is a vivid snapshot of a particular place and time, with all its divergent moods bursting into life again after being lost for so long.</p></div>"|19627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19627-various-artists-music-from-the-mountain-provinces/|7.1|Nick Neyland

Just two months after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=light+in+the+attic"">Light in the Attic</a> released <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19389-lewis-lamour/"">L’Amour</a></i>, the amazing lost debut by an artist known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32304-lewis/"">Lewis</a>, vinyl hunter-gatherers in Canada found what appeared to be an even more lost second album. A story that once seemed so abruptly truncated now appears to have at least one more chapter. Lewis—or Randall A. Wulff, or whatever his name actually was—simply disappeared after recording <i>L’Amour </i>in Los Angeles, presumably driving his pearly white Mercedes convertible off into the sunset. But now we know that he kept making music and recorded at least one more album, this one called <i>Romantic Times</i>.</p>
<p>When online forums began bustling with rumors of the discovery (in a collector’s vast archive of forgotten LPs) and when a sealed copy showed up on eBay (ultimately going for upwards of $1,000), it looked like <i>Romantic Times</i> might even be a hoax—some internet troll playing gotcha with vinyl fetishists. Not that it would be especially hard to parody the recent obsession with Lewis. On the surface the story seems to reinforce every negative stereotype of rock nerds: that they (let’s drop the pretense and just say “we”) are obsessives with little access to direct sunlight, who appreciate music more for its obscurity than for any integral quality it might possess. Such accusations might stick if <i>L’Amour</i> weren’t so good, so fascinating, so damned compelling on every level. It’s a puzzle to be solved, a story with no final chapter. Even more intriguing than Lewis’ identity and his fate, however, is the music itself. If he projected early 1980s alpha-male swagger—the perfect hair, the deep cleft chin, the bedroom eyes, the ostentatious ride—why did he create music that was so aggressively introverted, so hushed and precarious?</p>
<p>In 2014, however, it’s not difficult to imagine <i>L’Amour</i> finding a mainstream audience, although it may be somewhat fanciful. Now that <i>Romantic Times</i> is getting an official release (pre-orders for the August CD release and November vinyl release include an immediate download) and we’re finally hearing this 30-year-old album, here's the questions that come to mind: What if Lewis did find an audience in his time? What if, instead of fading even deeper into obscurity, he had somehow built up some kind of following? What if he was able to record a follow-up with a bigger budget, some grasp of what distinguishes him as an artist, and even a hazy idea that there were expectations he needed to live up to?</p>
<p>That’s a lot of hypotheticals, but the answer may, in fact, be <i>Romantic Times</i>. It’s certainly more self-conscious than Lewis’ debut, not to mention more assertive. It’s loopier, kitschier, and certainly less personal, although it might be more fun. First of all, there’s that voice, which graduates from the seductive mumble of <i>L’Amour</i> to a more enunciated moan. On “Bringing You a Rose” it’s more sexual than sensual, as though he’s turned the studio into a boudoir. Elsewhere, you can actually understand the words he’s singing, which certainly dispels much of the intrigue that clung to his debut. His transformation into a ghostly crooner pushes his songwriting to the forefront and proves a clever, albeit single-minded, lyricist. Opening with a shameless moan, “Don’t Stop It Now” sounds initially like he’s repeating a few short lines into a long song, but with each repetition he alters the refrain slightly—not just the words but which syllables he accentuates, which ones he draws out languidly.</p>
<p>And then there’s the music. Synths and guitar still provide the foundations for these songs, but Lewis has accessorized. Just a few measures into opener “We Danced All Night”, a saxophone wanders onto the stage, played by who the hell even knows. The instrument will show up a few more times on <i>Romantic Times</i>, less musical texture than a luxury item. And Lewis seems to have bought a drum machine of some sort, which pulses gently throughout these songs. “Be in Love with Me” sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a> if Giorgio Moroder only used factory presets. The music on <i>L’Amour</i> was so delicate that any hint of percussion might have fatally weighed it down, but the beats here are so peculiarly buoyant that they actually hold these songs aloft. “It’s a New Day” and “Where Did My Love Go Away” sound about as weightless as a bubble bath.</p>
<p>If <i>Romantic Times</i> is less special for sounding familiar, that may have more to do with listeners in the 2010s than with Lewis in the 1980s. There’s no way we could ever hear this album with fresh ears, away from the mysteries surrounding its creator. Nevertheless, there is still so much to enjoy here, so many unexpected musical flourishes and lush textures, so many elegant melodies and odd arrangements. From its amazing album cover to the single-mindedness of its subject matter, there is something incredibly endearing about the sheer ridiculousness of <i>Romantic Times</i> and its innate understanding of music as a luxury item, as prized as a white Mercedes or a private jet. </p></div>"|19697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19697-lewis-romantic-times/|8.1|Stephen M.

The Cologne producer and <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a> co-founder has put out a mountain of material under a variety of aliases over the last 20-plus years, but it’s his work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1686-gas/"">Gas</a> at the turn of the century that’s proved most lasting in a way that transcends techno nerdery. Inspired by Voigt’s experiences taking acid in Köln’s Königsforst forest when he was younger, his four albums as Gas—most notably, the 2000 masterstroke <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3402-pop/""><i>Pop</i></a>—are pinnacles of ambient music, applying a 4/4 sensibility to dense, pretty thickets of drone. The project was direct inspiration for Axel Willner’s classic 2007 debut as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"">the Field</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10022-from-here-we-go-sublime/""><i>From Here We Go Sublime</i></a>, a titanic crossover record for techno that, in turn, lent inspiration to scores of bedroom producers to this very day. (Even Voigt himself has indirectly addressed this legacy, briefly resurrecting the dormant Gas project last year to remix the title track to Willner’s latest album as the Field, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18538-the-field-cupids-head/""><i>Cupid’s Head</i></a>.)</p>
<p>Gas is an incomplete representation of Voigt's work, and that goes for anything else from his catalog, too. His sonic shifts from one release to the next that have proven as quixotic as they have pleasurably surprising. The last five years, especially, have been creatively fertile for Voigt, and a small sampling of his catalog from that time period suggests an artist that, even as he grows older, remains restless: last year, he resurrected his Mike Ink alias to put out three engaging 12” of 303-abusing techno, while 2010’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14327-freiland-klaviermusik/"">Freiland Klaviermusik</a></i> was almost infuriatingly unique, an anti-musical combination of piano loops and dry synthesized bass that ultimately grated on the ears. Last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18450-wolfgang-voigt-zukunft-ohne-menschen/""><i>Zukunft Ohne Menschen</i></a> was a sometimes-beautiful collection of arpeggiated tonal work; earlier this year, he released a pair of singles dubbed <i>Polkatrax</i>, which—you guessed it—took polka’s flatulent accordion sound and twisted it to fit a traditional techno structure.</p>
<p>Despite the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOLaTxa0cm8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lamb-and-tuna fish</a>-like combination of that description, the <i>Polkatrax</i> singles were among of the more listenable and straightforward of Voigt’s recent releases, which highlights why, despite his difficult reputation, Voigt’s latest work is always worth seeking out. You never know what you’re going to get from him next,. <i>Rückverzauberung 9/Musik Für Kulturinstutionen</i> continues the trend. The five-part suite was crafted for an exhibition in Berlin’s Haus Der Kulturen (featured, luminously and beautifully, on this release’s cover art) called Doofe Musik, Lieder zum Träumen, Betäuben Und Vergessen, which translates to “dumb music, songs for dreaming, numbing and forgetting”. So without hearing a note of this work, there’s an academic, distanced element to this release that might scare away casual passersby. But <i>Rückverzauberung 9</i> tuns out to be his strongest release of this decade thus far.</p>
<p>”Rückverzauberung” roughly translates to English as “reverse enchantment,” and Voigt has used the word over the last few years to tag a series of releases that fit the bill. In terms of Voigt’s 2010s catalog, <i>Rückverzauberung 9</i> bears strongest resemblance to 2011’s <i>Rückverzauberung 4</i>, a release that alternated between harmonious noise and discordant, colliding soundscapes that sounded like a few disparate instruments playing simultaneously and out of melodic step with one another. That certainly sounds complicated, and makes <i>Rückverzauberung 9</i>’s comparative appeal easy to understand: its composition is almost brutally simplistic, with slow loops of brass and accordion that double over themselves, become untangled, and messily rejoin over 52 contemplative, blissful minutes. The textured, nearly studious approach to repetition is unmistakably Voigt; even in a genre where it's considered a kind of monastic virtue, few artists have done as much with the concept as he has, and this is the latest example of his finding quiet nirvana in the realm of the infinite.</p>
<p>The temptation to compare <i>Rückverzauberung 9</i> to Voigt’s work as Gas is understandable; this is, after all, the closest he’s come to replicating his work in the field of ambient techno in quite some time. There’s no pounding 4/4 beat lying underneath these tracks, but the way the brass loops hypnotically undulate as the music plays does provide a specific pulse. As the proclamatory fanfare of <i>Rückverzauberung 9</i>’s opening minutes turns slightly menacing, hitting an exquisite stretch of gloom near its midsection, I’m reminded of Voigt’s work with Jörg Burger as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/506-burgerink/"">Burger/Ink</a> on the pair’s classic full-length from 1998, the deep techno opus <i>Las Vegas</i>—specifically, the dark magic of “Flesh &amp; Bleed”—not so much in terms of genre constraints as in its ability to conjure a downcast mood that, even as it sounds forbidding, invites you to get lost in its elliptical glory.</p>
<p>As <i>Rückverzauberung 9</i> crests, falls, and crests again before embracing a slow fade in its closing moments, Voigt’s golden-sounding fog most smacks of a release that <i>isn’t</i> his own—specifically, Icelandic composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2199-johann-johannsson/"">Jóhann Jóhannsson</a>’s 2004 composition <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4275-virulegu-forsetar/""><i>Virðulegu forsetar</i></a>, which similarly stretched a single cluster of brass-based melody over the course of an hour, to dazzlingly hypnotic effect. <i>Virðulegu forsetar</i>’s 2003 live premiere was in a large cathedral in Reykjavik, accompanied by under-inflated helium balloons that slowly fell into the crowd over the course of the performance’s runtime, and while taking in the gorgeous sighs of <i>Rückverzauberung 9</i>, it’s hard not to close one’s eyes and imagine something similarly serene. </p></div>"|19637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19637-wolfgang-voigt-ruckverzauberung-9-musik-fur-kulturinstitutionen/|7.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

But there’s also Dikembe Mutombo, Georgetown grad, builder of hospitals, Congolese humanitarian, <a href=""http://www.dmf.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">head of the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation</a>. This is the direction in which <i>Mediumship</i> takes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16815-healer-of-the-pride/"">Dikembe</a>. A year removed from <a href=""http://dikembe.bandcamp.com/album/chicago-bowls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an EP</a> that used the 1994 Bulls roster for a bunch of weed jokes (<i>Chicago Bowls</i>), Dikembe is in a position to be taken seriously and is making much more <i>serious</i> music.</p>
<p>Just about every one of Dikembe’s peers has experienced the same trajectory<span>—</span>as with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31918-you-blew-it"">You Blew It!</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31933-modern-baseball/"">Modern Baseball</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31610-into-it-over-it"">Into It. Over It.</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31582-dads/"">Dads</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31939-the-hotelier"">the Hotelier</a>, and countless others, they put out a record a few years ago embraced by emo diehards who recognized their potential amidst shoddy production and off-putting in-jokes. And like the aforementioned, they’ve taken their exposure as a challenge and inspiration and have gotten better in the process, clarifying their vision and growing more ambitious; they want to sound <i>professional</i>. However, the difference here is that Dikembe is just about the only one who hasn’t gone in a more accessible direction<span>—</span><i>Mediumship</i> is actually the most risky of the new breed because it could possibly alienate old fans for reasons that go beyond punk ethics.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <i>Mediumship</i>, Dikembe are unquestionably committed, but less enthusiastic. Spiky energy and jangled nerves have been swapped for slow-burn guitar patterns played clean, yet the minor keys and ringing overtones ensure that whatever linked Dikembe to the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgDPs_P9EB4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“twinkle daddy”</a> prank genre has been clouded by overcast, turbid atmosphere. Often anchored by portentous drums and downcast lyrics, just about everything here would be the slowest, sparest song on <i><a href=""http://dikembe.bandcamp.com/album/broad-shoulders"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Broad Shoulders</a>.</i></p>
<p>Fortunately, Dikembe honor their roots by avoiding the most played-out signifiers of “serious” indie rock discovery. There’s no <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths"">Smiths</a>, no <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division"">Joy Division</a>, no <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint"">Slint</a>, but there is a hell of a lot of an increasingly prominent influence in “thinking man’s punk”<span>—</span>post-<i>Deja Entendu </i>Brand New, particularly the quiet things that no one ever gives that band enough credit for. Steven Gray’s vocals are a dead ringer for those of Jesse Lacey's during the verses of any given Brand New song, as Gray never reaches for the piercing pop hooks. His lines are short and delivered with furrowed brows, squints, the telltale physical signs of small emotional implosions; opener “Even Bother” betrays the commitment in Dikembe’s complete sonic overhaul when Gray moans, “It’s been a long time coming/ I spent a long time rotting.” Then, a prickly palm-muted verse blasts into a full-on distorted blowout.</p>
<p>Granted, such things are typically a demonstration of musical virility. But when Dikembe do the same on the following “Hood Rat Messiah”, the contrast between Gray’s deflated tone reveals this move as defense mechanism, one last wounded swipe before tapping out. Though they don’t bear the same unbridled energy as in the past, Dikembe are still a little too agitated to make “pretty” music. They <i>can</i> make ""mood music"", though, and the pervasive uneasiness of <i>Mediumship</i> lingers more than the songs.</p>
<p>Gray’s lyrics exist somewhere between poetry and straight talk, just insular enough to be frustrating<span>—</span>when he sings “Safe to say mistakes were made/ Now all my lungs are heart-shaped/ But I can’t find a better way to be,” it's typical of a legible feeling verbally twisted to the point where it’s meaningful to Gray on a personal level. But you just wish Gray could come out and <i>say it</i>, whatever “it” is. Meanwhile, as the record progresses, the quiet-loud dynamics start to become predictable, and the most interesting songs are a result of avoiding easy crescendo; “Mad Frustrated” is a silvery, post-rock mini-epic that descends into an engrossing drum solo, while “Donuts in a Six Speed” abruptly shifts gears into a startling, math-y breakdown.  </p>
<p>Dikembe is a band that clearly has a personality; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkHifTEf5nc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the truly affecting video</a> that accompanied their cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10697-mariah-carey/"">Mariah Carey</a>’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” is proof enough and in the tradition of their most well-known song (“Keys to the Jeep”), they continue to be the one punk band whose hip-hop references come exclusively from female rappers—this time out, it’s Lauryn Hill (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv-0B-V-JpM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Mad Frustrated”</a>), Rah Digga (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AXmAA43DZA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Hood Rat Messiah”</a>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj"">Nicki Minaj </a>(<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEYn2bdO8rY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Donuts in a Six Speed”</a>). It’s a sign of the scene’s health that a record as strong as <i>Mediumship</i>can feel like a missed opportunity;<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> they’re a band in transition rather than one that fully realized their potential at the height of their visibility.</span> Then again, <i>Mediumship </i>strongly suggests that they could get there once the gawkers have moved on; if you were willing to identify as emo in 2010, you’ll do so when the trendpieces stop, too.</p></div>"|19581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19581-dikembe-mediumship/|6.6|Ian Cohen

""I was like, 'Damn, that is really cool, more people need to do that.'"" Since then, Dennis' band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27923-stardeath-and-the-white-dwarfs/"">Stardeath and White Dwarfs</a> have become some of the Lips' go-to fwends, having joined Uncle Wayne and co. for full album covers of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13836-the-dark-side-of-the-moon/"">Pink Floyd's <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i></a> and <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Linear-Downfall-Spaceface-2-Stardeath-and-White-Dwarfs-And-New-Fumes-With-Flaming-Lips-Playing-Hide-/release/3989861"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King Crimson's <i>In the Court of the Crimson King</i></a>, plus a smattering of other recorded and live endeavors.</p>
<p>Even when the Lips aren't around, you can hear the undeniable influence of their records and live show on Stardeath and White Dwarfs' albums—in the unmistakably Coynian vocals of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUIg6BLG8xM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Keep Score""</a> from their 2009 LP <i><a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Stardeath-And-White-Dwarfs-The-Birth/master/259420"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Birth</a>,</i> or in the minimal-then-blaring opener ""The Chrome Children"" (which could feasibly be mistaken for an <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13522-embryonic/"">Embryonic</a> </i>or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17804-the-flaming-lips-the-terror/"">The Terror</a> </i>outtake), from their latest album, <i>Wastoid</i>. But their proximity to the Lips is both a boon and a hang-up. While their profile has grown due to their Lips affiliations, that comes with a price: it's difficult to approach this LP <i>without</i> thinking of their more famous counterparts. At worst, this album frames Stardeath and White Dwarfs as an off-brand Lips offshoot—the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrappy-Doo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Scrappy-Doo</a> or <a href=""http://carebears.wikia.com/wiki/Care_Bear_Cousins"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Care Bear Cousins</a> to the Flaming Lips' unmistakable protagonist. SWD and the Flaming Lips are undoubtedly similar, but <i>Wastoid</i> just isn't very consistent.</p>
<p>The strongest and most grabbing elements on the album—the occasionally <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31237-fuzz/"">Fuzz</a>-like percussion, the beautiful acoustic bridge at the heart of ""Frequency""—are undercut by cheeseball lyrics. They often look to establish a sensual connection through coolly delivered phrases like, ""I'm the fire in your eyes"" or ""I'm the hot upon your skin"". On ""Birds of War"", they sing ""Take my mind away, Mary Mary Jane"". But the narrative on ""All Your Friends"" is perhaps the most difficult to digest. The narrator sings to the person he loves, who doesn't care for life on the road, but he knows that the person who's leaving him will eventually realize that ""Each town is all the same""—and the narrator will be waiting and eager to take that person back just as soon as they concede that he was right all along. </p>
<p>Dennis also shares his uncle's penchant for collaborating, as some of <i>Wastoid</i>'s best tracks feature guests. New Fumes show up for ""Hate Me Tomorrow"", adding urgency to an acoustic churn with a looming, buzzing low-end and scratching sonics. The album's title track, which features Chrome Pony, is a prog-pop tune with tambourines and a call-and-response chorus. But the album's undeniable high point is ""The Screaming"", which features the Flaming Lips themselves. It's a six-minute sprawl that most closely resembles something from <i>The Terror</i>, and while several tracks on the album aim for this same vibe, nothing feels quite this effortless or satisfying. The lyrics, too, manage to connect in their simplicity: ""I heard her answer me, I saw her smile/ I turned around and see 10,000 miles."" ""The Screaming"" makes subtle shifts to keep things captivating, starting out bleak and eventually finding bliss.</p>
<p><i>The Birth</i> was the work of a band with very good hooks peppered with proggy inclinations; by contrast, <i>Wastoid </i>only offers a few momentary bursts of life, like the squelchy synths that break up the monotony of ""Sleeping Pills and Ginger Ale"", or the funky rhythm section that marks ""Guess I'll Be Okay"". At the best, Stardeath and White Dwarfs suggest the potential to branch out and find their own lane; unfortunately, more often they repeat an idea for too long, and predictability sets in.</p></div>"|19671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19671-stardeath-and-the-white-dwarfs-wastoid/|5.7|Evan Minsker

To date, the music contained in each edition is as eclectic as the bands chosen to curate the series: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"">MGMT</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3611-royksopp/"">Röyksopp</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2619-lindstrom/"">Lindstrøm</a>. Hearing these bands as selectors has a certain charm, be it <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16428-belle-and-sebastian-latenighttales-vol-2/"">Belle and Sebastian’s affection for post-punk and the Lovin’ Spoonful</a> or <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Trentem%C3%B8ller-LateNightTales/release/2904805"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trentemøller’s alignment with the Black Angels and the Shangri-Las</a>. But in tapping Bill Brewster for a second compilation in as many years, Late Night Tales’ newest iteration of the series has a proper selector at the helm.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with Brewster, he runs the <a href=""http://www.djhistory.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DJ History</a> site and label, publishing dance music tomes such as the massively influential <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Last-Night-DJ-Saved-Life/dp/0802146104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406575177&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dj+history"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Last Night a DJ Saved My Life</i></a>, a <a href=""http://www.djhistory.com/books/boysown"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">compendium of the Boy’s Own acid house ‘zine</a> and first disco scribe Vince Aletti's <a href=""http://www.djhistory.com/books/disco-files"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">weekly columns from the late 1970s</a>. Brewster’s knowledge of dance music both old and <i>au currant</i> feels fathoms-deep and broad. It makes perfect sense that the week Brewster’s new set sees release, you could also <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b04bf1lf/northern-soul-living-for-the-weekend"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">find him on BBC4 discussing Northern soul</a>.</p>
<p>Last year’s <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Bill-Brewster-After-Dark/release/4548481"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brewster mix</a> was a heady mix of old and new, unearthing unreleased remixes and also heady tracks from the turn of the new century, moving from sleaze to cop show themes, French hip-hop to dubby house. <i>Nightshift</i> continues in a similar vein but sounds even more streamlined. Outside of two late '70s cuts, <i>Nightshift</i> sounds all of a piece, pulling from the same late-‘00s era of nu-disco. It opens with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30972-dj-nature/"">DJ Nature</a>’s strings-and hand drum-heavy remix of Typesun’s “Last Home” and then into a similarly string-filled track from the Blaxploited Orchestra.</p>
<p>The eighteen tracks that comprise <i>Nightshift</i> offer the slightest variations of a restricted sonic palette: disco’s boisterous basslines, hand percussion that echoes from deepest space, clean upstrokes of guitar, crisp hi-hats, swinging horns, swelling organs and electronic washes that arise and recede, any of the above elements prone to being dubbed out in the mix. And with no beat nudging past midtempo, it makes for smooth sailing, but as background music it tends to blend together in a way that is tough to differentiate.</p>
<p>But it speaks to Brewster’s expertise that he can fold in outliers like Salsoul Invention’s mid-70s disco stomp “Soul Machine”, or a deep cut from Kirk Degiorgio’s As One alias circa 2001, or an album track from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2366-justus-kohncke/"">Justus Köhncke</a>, and make them all sound as if they could have been pressed to vinyl in an edition of 150 hand-stamped copies last year and available for a minute at <a href=""http://www.phonicarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Phonica Records</a>. There’s even an appearance from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6049-robert-fripp/"">Robert Fripp</a>, working in conjunction with Dave Ball and Richard Norris of the Grid. Particular highlights include the deliriously infectious “Mopedbart"" from Hubbabubbaklubb, the catchiest song about a moped in recent memory. Had Brewster included the digital-only instrumental version of the Neurotic Drum Band’s 2009’s “Neurotic Erotic Adventure”, it might have provided an early peak in the mix; as it stands, the track–which otherwise smears acid, house and cosmic disco across a sensuous seven minutes—is derailed by its insipid humor, still making me grit my teeth five years later whenever the robot voices enter.</p>
<p>In mining such a small sliver of a sub-genre as late-'00s nu-disco, it seems that Brewster has his work cut out for him, but his ear is such that he can find small gems almost anywhere on any remix or rare B-side. There may not be towering heights here, but at almost any given moment in the mix, there’s a thrilling swirl of filtered strings, a nimble interlocking of hi-hat and kick, sweet outerspace synth blasts, or a catchy bassline that ushers you through to the next track. If I can’t differentiate between the likes of Paqua, Mugwump, or the Emperor Machine, others might be hard-pressed to; but on shuffle, the sameness of the tracks give <i>Nightshift</i> a curious trait in that almost any track can segue into the randomly generated next, making for a new mix each time.</p></div>"|19642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19642-various-artists-late-night-tales-presents-after-dark-nightshift/|7.4|Andy Beta

When she arrived, she discovered that her childhood home had been razed and in its place erected new, anonymous buildings. It was a different and less inviting place, one that did not match up to her memory. In her journals, which were published as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Everybodys-Autobiography-Gertrude-Stein/dp/1878972081"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Everybody’s Autobiography</i></a> in 1937, she wrote about the experience and concluded about Oakland, “there is no there there.” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6113-jenny-lewis/"">Jenny Lewis</a> examines a similarly thwarted nostalgia on her third solo album, <i>The Voyager</i>, and on the opening track “Head Underwater”, she sings, “I never thought I would ever be here/ Looking out on my life as if there was no there there.” It’s a pretty devastating admission of disconnection with oneself, as though the Jenny Lewis of today had no means of identifying with any of the Jenny Lewises of the past.</p>
<p>Not that you would immediately sense such alienation in “Head Underwater”. The beats thump with a laidback bustle, the synths shimmer as if submerged in a pool, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6846-the-watson-twins/"">Watson Twins</a> harmonize perfectly in the background, and Lewis’ vocals swoop sharply and assertively, with a slight ascending vocal arc that conveys optimism rather than its opposite. After the first verse, however, a dark, post-punk guitar theme emerges, more East than West Coast, casting a darker spell. The song strikes a particularly Californian balance of sun and sadness, and this glossy rumination is Lewis’ true milieu: If her trio of solo albums all sound different, they emanate from the same perspective. It’s been four  years since she released that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28920-jenny-and-johnny/"">Jenny and Johnny</a> album and six since she released her last solo album; even though the new album falters a bit, it’s nice to see the world from that point of view again.</p>
<p><i>The Voyager</i> is defined and motivated by a sense of personal nostalgia, as these songs sift through Lewis’ past to find some key to her present. There are passing references to the L.A. Riots and 9/11, which act as clearly identifiable landmarks in in her (and many people's) life. There are musings on her past selves, such as the “furious and restless” teenager in “Late Bloomer” or the woman chasing an ex on “She’s Not Me”. If this is Lewis’ most adult album—which is arguable, as the self-possession she conveys plays as a kind of maturity—then it’s primarily because she’s more adult now, with more experiences and more past selves. These songs wonder not only about how she got where she is, but also where that is exactly. She still sings about cheating on her boyfriend on “Slippery Slopes”, but justifies the discretion by claiming it makes her feel closer to him while she’s on tour: “If for just one second it helps us to remember that we like each other the most.”</p>
<p>The album title and its NASA allusion may refer to the rocket-fueled momentum with which “every boy and girl” flies through life, as Lewis muses on the title track. But the word also applies to her approach to making music. Especially as a solo artist apart from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3575-rilo-kiley/"">Rilo Kiley</a>, she has moved from one style to the next, trying on genres and traditions like an actress visiting the wardrobe department. It was rhinestones and Nudie suits for her debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4998-rabbit-fur-coat/"">Rabbit Fur Coat</a>,</i> which plumbed the Golden State’s country and country-rock history. She explored psych-pop on her 2008 follow-up <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12249-acid-tongue/"">Acid Tongue</a></i>.</p>
<p>By contrast, <i>The Voyager</i> is not quite so easily summed up. It’s not anchored in one particular scene, but plays as broadly California, with sly nods to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"">Byrds</a> in the guitars, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12350-the-go-gos/"">the Go-Go’s</a> in the vocals, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15999-randy-newman/"">Randy Newman</a> in the wry humor. On the other hand, the album is produced to sound produced—that is, to remind you that it is the product of a studio, and in particular, the studios of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"">Beck</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18-ryan-adams/"">Ryan Adams</a>. Such an approach lapses occasionally into tedious self-referentiality and even more tedious self-regard, especially on “Aloha &amp; the Three Johns”, about rock stars on vacation. The song plays like an episode of some low-rent game show where the contestants can’t even appreciate the luxury of their surroundings. Of course, the characters aren’t meant to be sympathetic, but they’re not especially relatable either.</p>
<p>Most of the time, however, Lewis is her usual smart, funny self—a singer whose default setting is wry skepticism and a songwriter with a gift for the telling detail and the blunt confession. On the Beck-produced single “Just One of the Guys”, she all but stops the song to underscore a moment of dire self-assessment. As the tempo slow and the instruments all fall away, shit gets real: “There’s only one difference between you and me/ When I look at myself, all I can see/ I’m just another lady without a baby.” Those lines nod to the expectations women of a certain age face not only from others but from themselves, yet Lewis manages to personalize it. Her delivery adds another layer of self-awareness and perhaps something darker, like resignation or regret. It’s a complicated sentiment nestled into a breezy pop tune, which is Lewis’ specialty. That precarious balance means there’s more than enough there there. </p></div>"|19686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19686-jenny-lewis-the-voyager/|7.2|Stephen M. Deusner

When working as part of the duo <a href=""http://www.jacoblondon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jacob London</a>, a collaboration with friend Dave Pezzner, Hansen focused on a goofy, skittering brand of house, stuffing EPs like <i>Casual Bingo</i> and <i>Brown Alert</i> with songs that sounded like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2560-luomo/"">Luomo</a> after a classic funk YouTube binge. His first few EPs as Hanssen, released around the turn of the decade, remained within the realm of beat-driven electronic music, but with a much greater seriousness; glitch and gimmickry were largely replaced with an elemental bent, by songs that either sprouted sturdy rhythmic roots or fizzled into the sky. His debut full-length <i>Seven Years Week</i> marks another step away from zany, cluttered body music, but retains some of the imagination and quirk that made that work special.</p>
<p>The best contemporary analogue for the sounds Hansen is exploring on <i>Seven Years Week</i> is probably the work of groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"">Emeralds</a>—and the solo work of that band’s members, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/"">Mark McGuire</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29955-steve-hauschildt"">Steve Hauschildt</a>—who make melodic, surprisingly dense ambient music. The genre’s lineage stretches back to German pioneers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>, groups that stretched the new technology behind synthesizers to its breaking point as the ‘60s morphed into the ‘70s, and that heritage is certainly identifiable in Hansen’s work. He spends much of <i>Seven Years Week</i> looking into the stars, whether through the cascading, echoing synth lines of “Solar America” or the more explicit titular homage of chugging closer “Lunar Sleep”. With that said, you get the sense that Hansen isn’t content just evoking the names of kosmische luminaries and calling it a day: he conducts a few experiments with texture and rhythm throughout the album, and the results are tracks that tend to linger once they’re finished. “Cholesterol” is a good example, built around a skittering, surprisingly nimble beat and a vocal sample that’s been sucked through an astral vacuum, and while Hansen eventually steers the song into more typical electronic terrain, it feels like it could’ve taken many different forms: downcast electro-pop, fodder for avant-garde rappers, a stretchy synth odyssey. He’s very good at inviting the listener to consider the wide range of possibilities that stem from a single beat or synth line, as if concepts are spilling out of his hyperactive brain and trickling down past the borders of his compositions.</p>
<p>Another one of <i>Seven Years Week</i>’s strengths is its brevity. Ambient and drone music sometimes can’t help but invite sprawl, with its slow-motion unfurling and occasional lack of focus, and there’s often a great deal of pleasure to be found in losing oneself to the slow, warm drift of a lone synth, floating through infinite space like the <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Voyager</a></i> twins. Hansen refuses to give in to this impulse, and it shows in the album’s length: <i>Seven Years Week</i> only breaks the half-hour mark by a few minutes, and none of its eight tracks come close to cracking the six-minute mark. It occasionally works against him—there are a few tracks, like “Solar America” and “Everyday with Rachael”, that could easily double in length without arousing a complaint—but overall, it keeps the album clean and refreshing rather than messy and exhausting, a veteran move from a producer who’s continued to mature without becoming stiff or sedate.</p></div>"|19546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19546-hanssen-seven-years-week/|7.0|Jamieson Cox

Grating percussive scraping and nail-on-chalkboard vocalizations dominate her creeping compositions, even as her instrumental work runs the gamut from deafening drones to clattering industrial drum beats. It's a bitter and icy collection of short form pieces and collaborations when taken as a single entity, but her first LP <i>Success</i> didn't provide a compelling full-length exploration of that tenebrosity. With <i>Persona,</i> her new record for <a href=""http://poshisolation.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Posh Isolation</a>, she's finally figured out how to present her strain of nauseating noise as a totemic, engaging whole.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Just as friends and fellow members of Copenhagen's underground music scene like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30758-lust-for-youth/"">Lust for Youth</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30458-lower/"">Lower</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/"">Iceage</a> continue to flirt with slicker production and pop structures on recent releases, Hoffmeier too has abandoned the universally bummed out aesthetic that's marked all of her efforts so far.  But rather than abandon the project's characteristic abstraction and abrasiveness, Hoffmeier uses <i>Persona</i> to diversify the moods that Puce Mary covers, offering disaffection, sexuality, and outright ferocity in addition to the desolation she's offered to date. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">""Courses"" relies on a blown out kick drum and the shrill trill of Hoffmeier's distorted vocals to offer a ferocious red herring to kick off the record. The outright terror and lurching subversions of industrial genre tropes rank it among the best in the mode that she's worked in most frequently. But where other noise records would offer little variations on that track's unhinged theme, Hoffmeier chooses to stagger in completely different directions for the rest of the record's six tracks, offering stark ambient pieces (""The Viewer""), squalling, sprawling noise jams (""Persona""), and the slow drone of the codeine-slurred ""Gesture"". <br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It's a daring move to expand the project's thematic focus so drastically, and though it sticks the landing on the tracks that retain ties to the all-encompassing darkness Hoffmeier knows so well, <i>Persona </i>offers a handful of missteps too. Two of the album's longer pieces, ""The Viewer"" and ""Impure Fantasy"", rely a bit too heavily on vocal melodrama to underscore their sweeping instrumentals. In the former, Hoffmeier unleashes a string of phlegm-y coughs to punctuate a gradual synthesizer swell; the latter features distant sounds of spitting and rattling chains underpinning what would otherwise be a compelling spoken-word exploration of empowered sexuality. In each of these cases, a flair for theatricality undercuts tracks that were already unsettling enough on their own. But in taking the risks that spawned those blunders, Hoffmeier has managed to create a varied and rewarding record that's uniform in its gloominess.</span></p></div>"|19606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19606-puce-mary-persona/|6.7|Colin Joyce

The <a href=""http://lawrenceenglish.com/sound/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">selected discography</a> on his website runs to more than 30 items. Diving in at random, you could luck into the glittering electro-acoustic miniatures of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14750-a-path-less-travelled/""><i>A Path Less Travelled</i></a>, his collaboration with Japanese group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25207-minamo/"">Minamo</a>, or the brightly mottled drone of <i>A Colour for Autumn</i>, one of English's most fully realized works by the traditional album standards of variety and cohesion.</p>
<p>But you could just as easily land in more of a niche taste, such as the fine but ascetic <i>For/Not for John Cage</i> or the crumbling edifice of organ chords on <i>Lonely Women's Club</i>. Save yourself some floundering, then, by starting with English's newest album, <i><a href=""http://emporium.room40.org/products/529199-lawrence-english-wilderness-of-mirrors-pre-order"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wilderness of Mirrors</a></i>. His first proper solo album since 2011's chorally inclined <i>The Peregrine</i>, it gins up infernos of harmonic distortion not unlike the heavier sides of Hecker and Frost. With a couple of minimalist exceptions—<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">the </span></span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">winding gusts of ""Guillotines and Kingmakers"" hearken back to <i>Cage</i>, while low frequencies roil between ghost harmonies on ""Wrapped in Skin""</span>—this is a maximalist effort, smear-painted on an abyssal dynamic range in scintillating masses of slow-moving tone.</p>
<p>English <a href=""http://emporium.room40.org/products/529199-lawrence-english-wilderness-of-mirrors-pre-order"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has said</a> that the album is named after <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/176666"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a line from T.S. Eliot's poem ""Gerontion""</a> and is conceptually based on Cold War misinformation campaigns—which, sure, why not? If abstract music has to be about something, that'll do. More meaningfully, English saw killer shows by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> while recording the album and was inspired to pump up the volume and density of his music, which is felt right away on ""The Liquid Casket"", a giant exhalation of thickly flexing drones that soon ignites in a radioactive mushroom cloud. English is an experienced technician, and his saturation of stereo space and tonality never grows murky—the songs make distinct impressions, from the backwards suck of the title track, like a foghorn tolling over heavy traffic, to the slowly subsiding muffled concussions of ""Another Body"" and the ritualistic cadence of ""Hapless Gatherer"".</p>
<p>Consistently, English cannily weighs out sticky, swarming passages against smooth pearlescent lengths, often drawing one out of the other with magisterial patience. The compositions range from delicate to mighty, and always activate invigorating corporeal effects. <i>Wilderness of Mirrors</i> isn't groundbreaking in general, but it is new territory for the often-cerebral English, and he puts an engaging, commanding stamp on this style of ambient overdrive hymn.</p></div>"|19559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19559-lawrence-english-wilderness-of-mirrors/|7.5|Brian Howe

Chicago veterans <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32375-novembers-doom/"">Novembers Doom</a> have always aligned themselves firmly with the latter camp, and have been steadily releasing heavily emotional melodic doom since 1995. Sole remaining original member and driving force Paul Kuhr started the band in Chicago back in 1989, so at this point Novembers Doom are showing their age—but they are doing so as gracefully as one might expect from a band who have dedicated their career to the beauty of melancholia.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Novembers Doom have always existed as a Midwestern <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4892-agalloch/"">Agalloch</a> of sorts (or perhaps a Yankee Woods of Ypres). Several members have even collaborated with Agalloch bassist Jason Walton on past Subterranean Masquerade recordings, and there are stark parallels to be drawn between the bands, in aesthetic if not entirely in sound. Novembers Doom have always worn their hearts on their black sleeves and remained partial to the kind of nature-driven imagery that Agalloch loved so much, but beyond that, both bands’ approach to doomy, intense, yet still very melodic and earthy dark metal has remained mostly unchanged throughout the decades.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>While still a certifiably underground entity, their name may sound very familiar to millenial metalheads who first stumbled across them during the band’s mid-'00s heyday. Their earlier recordings were less polished by default, but as studio budgets and the members’ own confidence in their abilities grew, so did the bombastic nature of the music itself.</span><i> Bled White</i> marks the band’s ninth studio album and fifth for <a href=""http://theendrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The End</a>, and this time they’ve pulled out all the stops: the inimitable Dan Swanö’s perfectly polished mix gives the album a big, commercial feel, not too far removed from his work on Bloodbath’s flawless <i>Nightmares Made Flesh</i>. Kuhr’s full-throated roars even echo Peter Tägtgren’s delivery at their deepest, adding a welcome edge and highlighting the proggy undertones on much of the album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Heavy moments abound, but the band's focus lies on the gentler, more complex melodic doom harmonies rather than the pummeling moments of death/doom. The sheer quiet prettiness of acoustic interlude “Scorpius” leading into the full-throttle aggression of “Unrest” sums up the album neatly, as Novembers Doom do their best to summon their own interpretation of darkness and light, quiet and thunder, and make sense of the spaces in between.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There’s a strong gothic feel to all of Novembers Doom’s material and their deeply personal, occasionally histrionic lyrics makes for an affecting listen. <i>Bled White</i> would be an excellent album to give to your younger cousin before bequeathing them your <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22996-candlemass/"">Candlemass</a> and <a href=""http://paradiselost.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paradise Lost</a> records; it’s gateway doom, and there is something to be said for that. There's nothing wrong with accessibility, even when discussing metal’s more ostensibly extreme offshoots. Novembers Doom peddle sorrow rather than savagery, and this time around, they’ve done an admirable job of making that sale stick.</p></div>"|19586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19586-novembers-doom-bled-white/|6.8|Kim Kelly

<p><i>Warby Parker Presents Beck Song Reader</i> is part of his showbiz phase; a laid-back benefit album that if nothing else reminds you that Beck may have started as an outsider but has long since become part of the establishment. Executive produced by Wes Anderson music supervisor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8877-wes-anderson/"">Randall Poster</a>, it features 20 interpretations of songs written for his <i><a href=""http://www.songreader.net"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Song Reader</a></i> project, which was originally released as a book of sheet music by the indie publishing cottage McSweeney's. Contributors include alt-Grammy types like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"" target=""_blank"">Jack White</a> and Norah Jones; budding national treasures like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4314-jeff-tweedy/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Tweedy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4769-jarvis-cocker/"" target=""_blank"">Jarvis Cocker</a>; and curiosities like Swamp Dogg and Sparks, who skirted the mainstream but never quite assimilated to it.</p>
<p>Then there's Warby Parker, as in <i>Warby Parker Presents Beck Song Reader</i>, a sunglasses company whose <a href=""http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/nMplo2LpYdEPG6FMhvPGjg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/finance/2013-03-27/7f5536db-d0d3-485f-b222-9d97448ed6bd_1-warby.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">chunky, bohemian frames</a> look like the kind of things an Upper West Side intellectual <a href=""http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/06/03/books/glaz190.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">might have worn</a> during the 1960s or '70s. Proceeds from the album go to <a href=""http://826national.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">826 National</a>, a nationwide nonprofit committed to helping school-aged kids with creative and expository writing, co-founded by Dave Eggers, who, is also the founder of McSweeney's. At some point describing the project becomes a Russian nesting doll of branding and attribution, brought to you by someone in conjunction with someone else for the benefit of yet someone else. Between Parker, McSweeney's, and the album's lineup itself, <i>Song Reader</i> crystallizes the maturation of the white indie set to the new ruling class—an arc traced by Beck's own career. This is a world of people who are mellow, organized, emotive within reason, a little retro and graced with just a zest of modernity.</p>
<p>Of course, there's no point in giving numerical grades to charities or sociological phenomena. Though the cause behind <i>Song Reader</i> is vital, the album is mealy, governed by some strange centripetal force that manages to pull a group of otherwise interesting artists toward a mean of midtempo Americana and light roots music. If you'd never realized how much fun. could sound like Jeff Tweedy or Norah Jones like Laura Marling, you soon will. Instead of highlighting the differences between its contributors, <i>Song Reader</i> makes them all feel roughly the same.</p>
<p>Speaking of fun., they emerge sounding inspired, shedding the Kevlar of their White Triumph routine for something more vulnerable. Same goes for Bob Forrest, who manages to capture the rooty, mahogany implications of the music better than just about anyone here. Most striking is Swamp Dogg's ""America, Here's My Boy"", in part because it's hard to imagine it being written by Beck. A gutted, funereal ballad built on piano and voice, it plays like a black hole in a wide swatch of beige—the kind of transformation of source material to final product that makes a prospect like <i>Song Reader</i> exciting in the first place. It reminded me of the first time I heard <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY6pMTPkUL8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Cash sing ""Rowboat""</a>, a modest country song from 1994's <i>Stereopathetic Soulmanure</i>. Not only did it suit Cash's talents, but also it revealed in Beck a capacity for music people hadn't yet expected from him. Both came out looking good.</p>
<p>Beck's last five or six years have been rife with experiment. Most of these experiments don't lie in the music, but how it's made. His <a href=""http://www.beck.com/recordclub/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Record Club</a> projects gathered loose groups of interesting people to cover entire albums in single days; his dedication to the maverick composer Harry Partch was written in Partch's own 43-tone scale; and his contribution to the Philip Glass remix album ended up being <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/dunvagenmusic/nyc-73-78"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a sprawling, 20-minute dream</a> consisting of passages of Glass' music with Beck drifting in and out over top. </p>
<p>And, of course, there's <i>Song Reader</i>, a project that pushes against the instantaneity of how we consume art in the digital world. On the one hand, nothing is as old-fashioned, or in particular a songbook, which speaks to ideals of music as something generated between live human beings around parlors and campfires. On the other, no digital stream could ever be as ephemeral as something that was never recorded in the first place. The idea is clever, and very Beck: a mix of the modern and the antiquated so fluid that you start to see how they're not that different to begin with. The execution feels out of his hands, and really, out of everyone's—just another project whose purpose seems lost in the labyrinth of production. </p></div>"|19667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19667-beck-song-reader/|4.5|Mike Powell

The pair of records that kicked off their career, the <i>Whip It On!</i> EP and <i>Chain Gang of Love</i>, were lurid, cinematic, and written entirely in single keys; career highlight <i>Lust Lust Lust</i> was a raw, roaring response to the band’s play for wider recognition, a failed gambit built around their second album <i>Pretty in Black</i>. These albums weren’t major stylistic departures or markedly more ambitious than the rest of their work, but they succeeded because they pitted the Raveonettes’ basic proposition—simple pop songs and sweet melodies, coated in layers of malicious fuzz and laden with comically dark lyrics—against clearly defined rules and boundaries. Conditioned with even the most trite gimmick, Sune Rose Wagner’s compositions have a better chance of acquiring staying power; left to stand on their own, they mostly achieve a pleasure that’s pleasant but fleeting. With their seventh full-length, <i>Pe’ahi</i>, the band attempts to steer clear of the latter problem by shifting their sound markedly. </p>
<p><i>Pe’ahi</i> doesn’t sound much like any of the Raveonettes’ other records, and that’s largely because they've added greatly to the instrumentation and effects. Where once Wagner and partner Sharin Foo were content to let their vocals and simple guitar chord patterns bear their songs’ melodic weight, they now employ harps, choirs, xylophones, and electronics; basic drum machine pulses are eschewed in favor of more complex, swinging breakbeats. These songs are different on a structural level, too, as Wagner leaves traditional verse-chorus-verse behind several times throughout the album, opting instead for multi-part mini-suites. They’re dense enough to honor the album’s namesake, a legendary Maui surf break, but still navigable; Justin Meldal-Johnsen, the veteran producer and multi-instrumentalist who mans the album’s boards, helps keep <i>Pe’ahi</i> clean despite all the layering and misshapen sound. Making sure to use every tool in their box, the band plays with dynamics to amplify choruses and hooks, a choice that yields the album’s finest moments; when “Sisters” explodes from a pristine harp pattern into a noisy wall of wild-eyed riffage, it provides a visceral thrill that lasts, even with repeated listening.</p>
<p>The greater range of tones and textures is coupled with lyrical material that skews uncomfortably personal. <i>Pe’ahi</i> was written and recorded in the wake of Wagner’s father’s unexpected death last Christmas Eve, and he spends much of the album grappling with the complicated realities of that paternal relationship. “Kill!” is the most obvious example—there’s really no denying the significance of a line like “One time I saw my dad fuck a redhead whore/ I never ever thought I would”—but even when Wagner isn’t explicitly discussing his father’s indiscretions, he’s thinking about the impact that behavior might’ve had on his own patterns of infidelity. The few tracks on the album that deviate from this theme aren’t beacons of light and joy, either; opener “Endless Sleeper”, studded with guttural yelps and propelled by a shifting breakbeat, recounts a near-death experience Wagner had while surfing in Hawaii half a decade ago. The Raveonettes are no stranger to bleak, almost decadent darkness—they’ve always used sex, drugs, and violence as propulsive devices, and one of their greatest songs is a jangling, ascending ditty called “Boys Who Rape (Should All Be Destroyed)”—but the level of detail and consistency of <i>Pe’ahi</i>’s assault renders the album oppressive.</p>
<p>The large evolutionary leap the Raveonettes have made on <i>Pe’ahi</i> raises an important question: does stepping away from sonic simplicity compromise the core of the band’s appeal? Though the band’s work has scattered along a narrow spectrum in the decade since they began their career, that kind of reliability holds value for both longtime listeners and casual fans. They’ve also come to serve as an effective “gateway band” for younger listeners who haven’t yet encountered the band’s considerable influences, funneling those nascent music fans towards the Jesus and Mary Chain and the meticulous, distinctive  pop craftsmanship of Phil Spector. The diversity of sound the band rolls out on <i>Pe’ahi</i> is certainly refreshing, but it takes a chunk out of the foundation of their career. </p></div>"|19689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19689-the-raveonettes-peahi/|6.3|Jamieson Cox

For one thing, you cannot own a physical copy of James Brooks’ first full-length as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31594-default-genders"">Default Genders</a>. More importantly, Brooks takes a principled, proactive stand against patriarchy, rape culture, rockism, and punk fascism in a way that should be familiar to anyone who discusses pop culture on Twitter or Tumblr. You almost feel obligated to say Default Genders is well-intentioned; being mindful of privilege is surely a good thing, no? But like much of the discourse confined to the internet, <i>Magical Pessimism</i> often substitutes accusation for empathy, conviction for coherence, and straw men for actual people to the point where you wonder whether Brooks’ intentions are to draw attention to the problem or just his own moral superiority.</p>
<p>This is an admittedly unusual way to begin a discussion about a pop record; <i>Magical Pessimism</i> isn’t a pamphlet. And though Brooks would likely claim Default Genders as a multimedia project, before the association with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a> and before giving himself a feminist rebrand <i>twice</i>, he was gaining attention with <i>Ruin</i>, the intriguing collection he made as half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28875-elite-gymnastics/"">Elite Gymnastics</a>. As with his politics, Brooks’ musical ambitions are bold and don’t hold up to a lot of scrutiny. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8954-elite-gymnastics/"">He expressed a desire to invert the canon</a> so it debunks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead"">Radiohead</a> and deifies the <i>Romeo + Juliet</i> soundtrack<span>—</span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4xPXlneCGs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">which conveniently ignores the 11th track on that CD</a>. Moreover, Brooks’ statement was an attempt to distance himself from the supposedly “nerd-male” influences (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order"">New Order</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division"">Joy Division</a>) he felt marred <i>Ruin</i>, a record that sounds a hell of a lot like <i>Magical Pessimism</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That’s a good thing, since <i>Ruin</i> was onto something, combining harsh drum'n'bass beats, blown-out ambience, and shards of noise, yet still found ways to fit Brooks’ predilections for classical composition and non-Western pop into the crowded mix. It rarely gels here, but you hear why artists have taken a shine to Default Genders; Brooks is an ""ideas guy"" and the application of lo-fi and punk aesthetics to non-guitar music tends to be exciting on general principle.</p>
<p>But <i>Magical Pessimism</i> still abides by typical “rock” signifiers to provide its most satisfying moments: basic A-B song structure, choruses that surge on distortion (“The Trees in the Driveway”), and beats that more often recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2795-moby"">Moby</a>’s midtempo big-beat crossovers or even the blazingly hetero KROQ-core of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30622-the-1975"">the 1975</a> (“Stop Pretending”). Brooks is at his best making anthems, while his deconstructionist tendencies are easy to confuse with carelessness<span>—</span>on the high-NRG tracks, the EQing is boxy and the mixing is inconsistent, at times burying Brooks’ voice, something that barely works as texture. Tracks cut out and begin erratically, sacrificing any semblance of cohesion or flow. Only an extremely generous interpretation would be to assume these are part of Brooks’ greater aim to demystify or at least denigrate The Album, that totem of rockism.</p>
<p>Then you have Brooks’ vocals, a tuneless, meek mutter used for chest-poking confrontation, divisive by design. At times, they lend an ear-turning effect to otherwise basic melodies and a conceptual force that has endeared him to a young, plugged-in niche audience. Not only does Brooks' approach tell the listener, “anyone can do this, even <i>you,</i>” but he shares a teen’s tendency towards thinking in absolutes about their own perceived persecution and the failings of others. And besides, his conversational cadence is the only delivery in which his most angsty lyrics (“Fine, cool whatever, thanks for clearing that up”, “Fuck that, fuck them, fuck you, <i>ugh</i>...fuck my life”) can sound less awkward than they read.</p>
<p>The problem is that Brooks applies the same black and white thinking to some of the most mature and complex topics which prove to be way out of his depth. He’s a thoughtful, sincere person and that comes through in his interviews or an unadorned observation about a stock, upwardly mobile type from “The Trees in the Driveway”<span>—</span>“You have to take out your piercings before you get to work/ But otherwise they’re pretty cool about the way that you dress.” When he tries to convey unearned gravitas, it just results in leaden metaphor that hits with a dull thud<span>—</span>“The trees in the driveway start to shed all their leaves/ Some people would it’s cause they’re dying/ But to you it just seems like they’re focused on the important things.”</p>
<p>Worse is that he shows little interest in actually getting to know the enemy<span>—</span>“punk” and “the suburbs” and “pain” are shoebox dioramas in which the characters serve as action figures, free of agency and simply arranged by Brooks to demonstrate his place on higher moral ground. If you have any kind of lingering guilt about your own privilege, a line like, “Tell me again how heavy the crown is/ About the weight of the burden of being white and male” should decimate you. But in the context of <i>Magical Pessimism</i>’s pervasive self-congratulation, the takeaway is that Brooks would obviously never do such a thing.</p>
<p>This becomes almost impossible to bear during <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15781-dead-girlfriends-on-fraternity"">“On Fraternity”</a>, originally recorded under Brooks' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31565-dead-girlfriends/"">Dead Girlfriends</a> moniker and raising the question of whether there’s a wrong way to do the right thing. It’s been understandably viewed as a companion piece to Grimes’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12617-oblivion/"">“Oblivion”</a>, a brilliantly conceived pop song you can hear at malls, gyms and on the street<span>—</span>the same places where one could be subject to the harassment Claire Boucher speaks upon. “On Fraternity” is in a different, more checkered tradition of men writing songs about misogyny, which can <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haR_uf2Zv5A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">go extremely wrong</a>, but the risk can occasionally be justified by the reward. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi"">Fugazi</a>’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIywtO0OY78"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Suggestion”</a> was both a bold strike against their peers and sensitive towards it subject, while on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5308-pissed-jeans"">Pissed Jeans</a>’ ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mQUcvtWXwI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Male Gaze</a>"", an average schlub showed that admitting his faults and changing his behavior can be a powerful display of allegiance.</p>
<p>“On Fraternity” got people talking about these things, and shouldn’t that be enough? Its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4683-xiu-xiu"">Xiu Xiu</a>-esque scree provides <i>Magical Pessimism</i>’s most arresting musical moment, but lyrically, it’s got the resonance of a #yesallmen hashtag. On its own accord, “The way they act like even bringing it up/ Means you’re the one with the problem” could be a powerful, concise acknowledgment of the presumptions of guilt and ""blame the victim"" investigative process that often prevents sexual assault claims from being reported in the first place. Instead, you’re seemingly meant to marvel at <i>Brooks’</i> bravery here.</p>
<p>That’s how “On Fraternity” and much of <i>Magical Pessimism</i> comes across, and yet I don’t truly believe Brooks thinks that way<span>—</span>even he’s called the song a ""<a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/default-genders-james-brooks-on-fraternity-controversy-response/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">total failure</a>."" I wouldn’t be surprised if Brooks comes up with a long Tumblr post about all the ways this record has been misconstrued and he could be right about all of it. After all, you live on the internet for long enough and you realize how often good intentions can be completely negated by ineffective communication; that in real life situations, you might be friends with the guy you’ve been beefing with for months, and a two-minute conversation can defuse a grudge that resulted in reams of Twitter dialogue and reblogs. <i>Magical Pessimism</i> is hardly a total failure, and like many talking points that live on the internet, it can cause a discomfort that feels productive. But it’s ultimately up to the speaker to make the best use of his limited communication tools and Default Genders reminds you why so many people are relieved that Twitter finally has a “mute” function. </p></div>"|19676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19676-default-genders-magical-pessimism-2014/|5.6|Ian Cohen

It’s less than half an hour of garage power-pop that takes itself about as seriously as its finger-tapping guitar solos and songs about kids eating McDonald’s at 3:00 a.m. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32398-actual-water/"">Actual Water</a> are underachievers who worship simplicity. They make music from the same cro-magnon tools that built rock’n’roll, but the Toronto band do it with a wry smile, playing dumb while being in on the joke. </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In 2012, Actual Water said they wanted to be <a href=""http://www.chartattack.com/news/2012/01/24/get-to-know-actual-water/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">“ABBA with denim jackets on,”</span></a> an elevator pitch that ably describes where the band landed with <i>Call 4 Fun</i>. <span>But their </span><span>history of experimentation and relatively stingy album output give these songs some actual dimension. The </span>winding trip went from blown-out, jazzy krautrock on their 2008 LP <i>Double Negative</i> to the more AM-radio 1960s psych of 2011’s <i>The Paisley Orchard.</i> Through the years, band mainstays Gary Pooni and Anthony Nemet have been slowly clipping off the noise and polishing their sound until their love for Neu! and Swell Maps gave way to their love for Sloan and Led Zeppelin. </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Pitchfork writer Stuart Berman once called band's journey like <a href=""http://actualwater.bandcamp.com/album/the-paisley-orchard"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Beatles evolution in reverse,""</a> an arc that continues here with “Latoya"", whose polite three-part harmonies and gee-golly lyrics sound ripped right off a broadcast of <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>. “Latoya” is a fine emblem of how frictionless they sound now. It's one of those shiny pop products that couldn't just come spilling haphazardly out of a basement jam session. It's not necessary to have the context of their early albums to hear the craft that went into this, but it's a large part of what makes <i>Call 4 Fun</i> have a bit more longevity than your average garage record. </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">The band's pedigree matters far less than the album's hooks. There’s a bit of slurring, New York post-punk on the closer “Gorgeous George”, and a bit of Jerry Lee Lewis piano dancing on “Take The Stairs”, but those just add color to the style they've found. It helps that they don’t aimlessly tour around rock history so much as cull from the best parts of it—or the parts that sound the good after eight cans of Old Style. The guitars sound like they only have one or two pedals hooked up to them. The drums have a boomy Keith Moon feel, and their vocals find a nasally medium between snotty punk and Elvis Costello. Something like “Power Pop Radio” functions like an instruction manual for the album: “Get drunk with your friends so we know we’re not alone,” they sing on the chorus. The song, naturally, is a prototype power pop jam, which continues the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFMD7Usflbg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">long tradition</a> of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5luzVtBMxpw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing songs</a> about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKTUAESacQM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a genre</a>, in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_sY2rjxq6M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">style of that genre</a>. </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">In just 23 minutes, Actual Water create the feel of a summer full of love and delinquincy. It’s about what could happen if you dialed that phone number in the bathroom stall, the one that says “Call 4 Fun” underneath it. The days could lead to sitting around talking shit about a blowhard named “Waldo Jackson”, or coming home late at night and housing fast food in front of a computer. And while most of these songs are suited for doing donuts in the high school parking lot, there's a funny, kind of poignant moment in ""The Wait"". It's simply about a ride to somewhere, interminibly delayed: ""January through November/ We've been waiting for you."" That univsersal feeling of waiting for that guy to come pick you up to take you to that party that's going to rule? Actual Water are definitely that guy, and here they are, so hop in.</span></p></div>"|19632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19632-actual-water-call-4-fun/|7.4|Jeremy D. Larson

The most notable of these is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9830-tobacco/"" target=""_blank"">Tobacco</a>, who pulled him in to work out some synthesized body-horror psych boogie as Demon Queen. But music under Zackey's own name is still relatively overlooked, with earlier releases like 2011's glitchy, hit-and-run <i>Criminal Wave</i> EP and the abstract sludge rap of <i>Blood Brother</i>, his 2010 teaming with brother Nathan No Face, proving ambitiously eclectic enough to make categorization elusive.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Considering his professed debt to '80s-baby fixtures like Prince and Egyptian Lover—understandably earned, since the now-40 ZFF was an impressionable grade-schooler back then—it wouldn't be out of the question to call <i>Money Green Viper </i>the best intro to his catalog. Even if it's not necessarily his best or his most startling, it's probably the most fun entry point to people looking to figure out his whole deal. And the easy route is to draw parallels to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28083-dam-funk/"" target=""_blank"">Dâm-Funk</a> with a sliver of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/"" target=""_blank"">Chromeo</a> in his veins—the joy of electro-boogie cut through with a nod of sly loverman irreverence.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But deeper examinations reveal a couple of complications. First off, most of the dominant electro-boogie vibe comes from other producers, with Inkswel's slightly-warped but immediately catchy ""Glass Tear Groove"" and Tom Noble's </span><i>Parade</i><span>-vibe ""Cocaine Lady"" making for early highlights. Meanwhile Zackey's own time behind the boards produces beats that, while immersive, also feel like outliers: wavy 808 pastel-beach slow jams (""Montego Bay""), choppy weed-cough lounge-Stevie (""Zackey Can't Rap""; ""Fuck Your Fire""), and a head-swimming electric piano instrumental (""Suicide"") that plays like a Lonnie Liston Smith interlude. And secondly, Zackey's presence as a singer is a tricky thing to get used to, as his falsetto creaks and mutters as much as it glides. It takes some patience to get past that—as well as the fact that some of the stuff he's singing, like the first-draft come-ons of ""Yo Bael"" (""Wanna get close to you, what you say/ Oh girl, let's take this party to my room, babe"") or the pitched-up entry-level pimp talk of ""A$$$low,"" scans a little off either ironically </span><span>or </span><span>sincerely.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Problems like that mostly stick out as a brief mid-album speed bump to be endured, however, with the back-loaded latter half of </span><i>Money Green Viper </i><span>revealing a few deep-cut surprises. There's the aforementioned ""Zackey Can't Rap"" (a legit funny bit of shit-talk directed to Zackey's mic skills that's either channeling some unnamed hater or ZFF's own self-effacement) and the soothing, floaty ""Suicide"". But there's also the Quik-in-space bounce of the Max Kane-produced ""Out My Mind"" and a run of songs—""Gunny Peace,"" ""Roch,"" and ""Write Her Name""—that reveal a genuine eccentricity that's neither an affectation or an obstacle to get his stay-posi side across. It's not the easiest music to love sometimes, but with all the oddball goodwill at work, it's even harder music to hate.</span></p></div>"|19626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19626-zackey-force-funk-money-green-viper/|6.6|Nate Patrin

It wasn’t just that the band was built precariously upon the complementary-but-combative songwriting partnership between Nick “Diamonds” Thorburn and Alden “Ginger” Penner, or that their infamous live shows were liable to degenerate into a chaotic clusterfuck of broken gear and profanity-laden tantrums. For the Unicorns, this instability was embedded into their music’s root DNA; they took the term “pop music” at face-value and left us with a gooey, messy, combustible splatter. But with 2003’s <i>Who Will Cut Our Hair When We’re Gone</i>—their first and, to date, final widely released recording—Thorburn and Penner effectively got their shit together just long enough to herald their band’s demise.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In an early-2000s Montreal music community renowned for heart-on-sleeve, shoot-for-the-moon rockestras (see: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1037-the-dears/"" target=""_blank"">the Dears</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3933-stars/"" target=""_blank"">Stars</a>, and, of course, scene lynchpins <a href=""http://www.brainwashed.com/godspeed/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a>), the Unicorns were the odd band out. From the color-coordinated white-on-pink stage attire to their bottomless well of theme songs for imaginary cartoon characters (“Jellybones”, “Sea Ghost”) to the vintage synthesizers set on “fart,” the Unicorns seemed to be the antithesis of their more openly impassioned, stern-faced peers. And the one emergent local band with whom they initially shared a predilection for <a href=""http://www.hipsterrunoff.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800/sotc_0.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gimmicky onstage attire</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyGiarEAM2M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=34s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vocal hysterics</a>, and volatile performances—the Arcade Fire—would soon solidify into a model of poise and professionalism, something the Unicorns could never hope to become. Sadly, they didn’t survive long enough to divest their almost-anthem “Let’s Get Known” of its aspirational irony: After touring themselves into the ground over the course of 2004, the Unicorns would unceremoniously disband just as south-of-the-border publications like the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/arts/music/06carr.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>New York Times</i></a> and <a href=""http://books.google.ca/books?id=LvowiBHKWgsC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=SPIN.com+montreal+music+scene&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ypOJyS3Cht&amp;sig=4CHjYIIuN0c28gpf2jaVZHM_gxQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bQbTU4XHLM-pyAST3oK4DA&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=SPIN.com%20montreal%20music%20scene&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Spin</i></a> were flying reporters up to Montreal to soak up the city’s <i>je ne sais quoi</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Eleven years may strike some as a premature anniversary for a reissue, but the Unicorns’ moment feels so much deeper in the past when you consider how slick and streamlined popular indie-rock has since become, and how few records have matched the scatterbrained unpredictability, frayed-nerve unease, and tooth-rotting tunefulness of <i>Who Will Cut Our Hair</i>. Throughout its 13 tracks (many of which are re-recordings of songs from two limited-run self-released discs), the Unicorns gleefully defy easy categorization as if they were a group of sneaky seventh-graders playing dodgeball: Too complex to be classified as garage-rock, too unsettled to be psychedelic, too hooky to be described as art-damaged, and too fiercely funky to lapse into twee solipsism. (The latter quality came courtesy of secret-weapon drummer Jamie Thompson, who only appears on a handful of tracks here, but who became a full-fledged member after the album’s release.) Each song seems to undergo a diagnostics check—squelching synth test patterns, random rimshots, documentary snippets about Satanism—before it’s set loose, eventually traversing enough twists and turns to rival the Who’s epic “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIpsDTSmRyM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Quick One, While He’s Away</a>” in half the time. And even after living with this album for over a decade, you’re still never quite sure where it’s going to take you.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Unlike many songwriting foils, Thorburn and Penner have similarly peculiar voices, giving their melodic interplay a finish-each-other’s-sentences sense of intuition while lending their moments of playful in-song sparring a discomfiting tension. When the two start trading “No you’re not”/ “Yes I am” schoolyard-grade taunts on “Child Star”, it’s not unlike watching Siamese twins head-butting one another. But if that song—reportedly inspired by an unpleasant encounter with a past-his-prime Corey Haim—sees the two engaged in obvious role-play, other tracks blur the line between pretend-jousting and actual acrimony.</p>
<p class=""p1"">True to their capricious nature, the band’s would-be theme-song celebration, “I Was Born (A Unicorn)”, devolves into a custody battle between Thorburn and Penner for control of the band: “I write the songs” / “<i>I </i>write the songs!”/ “You say I’m doing it wrong”/ <i>“You are</i> doing it wrong!” But while the Unicorns may act childish, their sense of nostalgia flies in the face of today’s Instagram-filtered, #tbt sentimentalism; instead, <i>Who Will Cut Our Hair</i> transports you back to that pivotal moment in childhood when you first realize the meaning of death, and one’s sense of naïveté and frivolity give way to confusion and terror. For all their surface silliness—this is a band whose idea of sensitivity is serenading lines like “Somewhere in the asshole of my eye/ There’s a muscle which relaxes when you cry”—the Unicorns were motivated by a genuine desire to comfort, using fantastical images of ghosts and haunted houses to temper real-life fears and anxieties. After all, an album that begins with the flustered “I Don’t Wanna Die” ends with the peaceful “Ready to Die”, suggesting that acceptance of death is the first step to truly living.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That certainly seems to be the case for Thorburn, whose ambitions have since shifted into overdrive, with forays into hip-hop (Th’ Corn Gangg), Everly Brothers-style harmony-folk (Human Highway), 1950s doo-wop (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29216-mister-heavenly/"" target=""_blank"">Mister Heavenly</a>), and cinemascopic art-rock (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2148-islands/"" target=""_blank"">Islands</a>). Penner, by contrast, has resurfaced only sporadically, taking a rough-hewn, deconstructionist tack with his short-lived band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13036-clues/"" target=""_blank"">Clues</a> and his recently released solo album. But the duo’s divergent post-Unicorns trajectories ultimately reemphasize the perfect, delicate balance the duo achieved together.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While it remains to be seen if their recent reconciliation will yield any new material, for now, the four rarities included on this reissue function as fresh flowers at an old gravesite, offering affectionate reminders of a legacy cut short prematurely. These include two intricate-yet-immediate songs (“Evacuate the Vacuous” and “Let Me Sleep”) that fit snugly within <i>Who Will Cut Our Hair</i>’s prog-pop parameters, and a live recording of the never-released “Haunted House” that provides a glimpse of the Unicorns’ notoriously off-the-cuff performances and Thorburn’s cheeky banter.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But perhaps the best exemplar of The Unicorns ethos can be heard in their excellent cover of “Rocket Ship” by Daniel Johnston, the Texan pop savant who first formulated the uncanny mix of innocence and horror that informs every song in the Unicorn canon. That Johnston nod further positions the Unicorns’ modest modus operandi in stark contrast to that of their world-beating Montreal-scene mates. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">The reformed Unicorns will be opening some amphitheater dates for their old pals the Arcade Fire next month, but this reissue serves as a warm reminder that, once upon a time, the idea of the opposite scenario happening in 2014 wouldn’t have seemed so ridiculous.</span></p></div>"|19685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19685-the-unicorns-who-will-cut-our-hair-when-were-gone/|8.9|Stuart Berman

""I would say middle of August,"" he told <i>DJ Mag</i>. ""And if it doesn't come out then, OK, maybe we should never release it.""</p>
<p>But what's another week or two (or fifty-two, for that matter) in the case of an album that was supposed to come out nearly three years ago? In pop music, any three-year delay is kind of a big deal—just ask Axl Rose—but that's especially true when your record has a numerologically significant title with a hard expiration date: November 11, 2011, to be precise. Nevertheless, some 42 months after Gerber told <i><a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feed-item.aspx?id=20575"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_Blank"">Pulse Radio</a></i> that he was ""just adding finishing touches"" to the album, it's finally here, and it's a head-scratcher.</p>
<p>That's not necessarily for the reasons you might expect, beginning with the fact that Gerber and Diddy make for an exceptionally odd couple. After all, despite the narrowing distance between hip-hop and dance music over the past couple of years, the two musicians occupy vastly different spheres. Gerber, a 12-year veteran of the European tech-house scene, is known for moody, instrumental cuts designed to worm their way into fried synapses at stupid o'clock in the morning; they're spaced out but subtle, hovering hypnotically on the cusp between melody and monotone. (They're also frequently kind of boring, but hey, ketamine is a hell of a drug.) Diddy, on the other hand, is one of the rap game's greatest hustlers, a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM0-ZU8njdo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_Blank"">master of the obvious</a> who wouldn't know subtlety if it knocked the <a href=""http://www.digitalfrontiersuf.com/2010/02/in-the-shadow-of-a-giant-holding-umbrellas-for-people-more-important-than-you"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_Blank"">umbrella out of his manservant's hand</a>.</p>
<p>The two musicians hooked up when Diddy used one of Gerber's tracks for 2010's <i>Last Train to Paris</i>, a club-influenced album released under his Diddy-Dirty Money moniker; Diddy subsequently flew Gerber to New York and set him to work making beats, giving him one of Gerber's own tracks as a guide. Fittingly, <i>11:11</i> sounds very much like a Guy Gerber record. Most of its 11 tracks cruise along at a mid-tempo, four-to-the-floor chug; they're full of sensual suggestion and druggy melancholy, with purring vocals pitched low and drum machines dissolving into spirals of analog delay. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15851-mathew-jonson/"">Mathew Jonson</a> are the main outside influences, the former for their smeary dub effects, and the latter for his Middle Eastern-tinged scales and gently filliping glissandi.</p>
<p>But, like Gerber's <a href=""http://www.fabriclondon.com/store/fabric-64.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fabric mix</a> of all-original material, it's too often meandering, unfocused and undifferentiated, the mixdown muddy and gelatinous. Setting aside the aimless opener, ""Never Walk Alone"", a four-minute instrumental that sounds like they tried to make something modeled after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">the Cure</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition/""><i>Disintegration</i></a> but accidentally leaned on half the mixer's track-mute buttons, the album actually gets off to a strong start with ""Broken Windows"". Over a dry, loping drum beat, a wistful little synth melody sashays back and forth, backed by faint chimes and fluttering keyboards, and a queasily processed voice sings of distance and unrequited love. It's the one truly original moment on the album, the one greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts fusion of their respective talents for atmosphere and pop songcraft.</p>
<p>But from there, the album tends to hopscotch from holding pattern to holding pattern. ""Floating Messiah"" drizzles melting horns over an ostinato bass line as Gerber fiddles with FX and Diddy mutters about divine love and the love of the divine (""You gotta believe in something, I believe in her… Y'all think I'm talkin' about women? I'm talkin' about God, or a higher being, whatever you believe in""). ""Lifted"" trots out a snapping, Cobblestone Jazzy synth-and-drum-machine jam while Diddy reels off vocoded nonsequiturs. It doesn't feel as fresh as ""Broken Windows,"" but it's probably the album's standout club jam, setting aside ""Tourist Trap"", a minimal-house anthem that samples Diddy-Dirty Money's ""Hello Good Morning"" and was a big deal in clubs <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/track.aspx?339015"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_Blank"">way back in 2011</a>.</p>
<p>""Angels,"" with its watery wibbles, psychedelic guitar and loping disco beat, sounds like a confused fusion between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29373-soul-clap"">Soul Clap</a>; ""I Hear Her Calling Me"" is similarly bathetic and even more unfocused, with piano noodling tangled up with dub delay, trap hi-hats, and about 17 layers of background vocoder. And so it goes, all the way through to the closing ""Terminal K"", an altered-states ode that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29917-ricardo-villalobos-and-max-loderbauer/"">Ricardo Villalobos</a> clumsily remixing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1030-dead-can-dance/"">Dead Can Dance</a>. (No prizes for guessing what that letter stands for, given that back in March, Diddy confessed to listening-party attendees that they considered calling the album <i>Ketamine</i>.)</p>
<p>Diddy's interest in dance music actually goes back more than a decade. Way back in 2004, he enlisted Stuart Price, Nellee Hooper, and Erick Morillo, among others, to make a project called <i>Divided Soul</i>, an Ibiza-inspired record that got derailed when Ibiza proved a little too inspiring. (""We rented a house [in Ibiza], and we started,"" Diddy told Pete Tong at the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8hPq9FRY0A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_Blank"">IMS Engage conference</a> in April. ""We were supposed to record for seven days, but once I went out to the clubs I didn't return back to the house for seven days."") A few years later he discovered DC-10's Circoloco parties, where he <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNTTymAQED8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_Blank"">brandished a miniature vuvuzela</a> and mingled with the sweaty, sunglasses-wearing masses to the strains of DJs like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bwGs5egHgY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perlon's Zip</a>.</p>
<p>So it's not that surprising that Diddy would gravitate towards the deeper, more ruminative strains of European tech-house, rather than the flash-bang varieties of EDM that have captured the imagination of hip-hop artists from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"">Araabmuzik</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6154-lil-jon"">Lil Jon</a>. What's surprising is how little of Diddy there seems to be in the record at all. Despite the album's lengthy gestation period, <i>11:11</i> doesn't feel like some epochal meeting of the minds; it feels like a Guy Gerber album where Diddy occasionally turns up to mutter free-associative fragments or sing a few lines through a vocoder.</p>
<p>Given that both artists often come across like <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Spinal Tap</i></a> characters come to life, their collaboration should have been, by all rights, some kind of gonzo, pinch-yourself-to-make-sure-it's-real, over-the-top fusion of American entrepreneurship and Ibiza spectacle, of urban smarts and Balearic cool. Instead, for all its self-indulgent qualities, it's merely tasteful and weirdly tentative. And there's little inkling as to the significance of the title <i>11:11</i>, which <a href=""http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/09/06/a-special-kinda-guy-getting-deep-with-mr-gerber"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_Blank"">Gerber once said</a> was meant to indicate ""a date when a mystical gate is open and two worlds collide."" Perhaps when the gate slammed shut on that November 12, three years ago, they should have realized it was time to go back to the drawing board.</p></div>"|19643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19643-diddy-guy-gerber-11-11/|4.9|Philip Sherburne

Born in the early 1940s, she began performing with her sisters at their small church in Midway, Alabama. After graduating high school and discovering soul music, she moved first to Florida and then to New York City, where she continued singing in church but also held court in Brooklyn nightclubs under the name Naomi Davis. Like many African American singers at the time, her repertoire balanced the secular and the spiritual, the worldly and the heavenly. Even though her singing career spans half a century, her recording career has been much shorter. In 1999, she and an old friend/collaborator named Cliff Driver formed a gospel group that attracted the ear of Gabriel Roth. At the time he was running a label called Desco, for which Shelton recorded two sides; when it folded, she signed with his new venture, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=daptone&amp;min_year=1999&amp;max_year=2014"">Daptone Records</a>.</p>
<p>She’s been a major presence on that label’s roster, touring the world with the Daptone Super-Soul Revue and singing with the Sugarman 3. Never quite as popular or as prolific as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2240-sharon-jones-and-the-dap-kings/"">Sharon Jones</a> (who is Daptone’s flagship act), Shelton has proved a powerful vocalist and performer even into her 70s. In 2009, she finally released her debut full-length for the label, <i><a href=""https://daptonerecords.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=82"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">What Have You Done, My Brother?</a>, </i>which closed with a soul-stirring cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9333-sam-cooke/"">Sam Cooke</a>’s “A Change Is Gonna Come”. Five years later, she’s finally following it up with <i>Cold World</i>. As the title suggests, Shelton is concerned not just with the individual sinner but with the sad state of the world. Faith is never a private matter; because it informs how we treat ourselves and others, it is a social concern.</p>
<p>Consequently, Shelton is drawn to songs that address social issues and paint the world bleakly. “It’s a Cold, Cold World” describes the back-stabbings and betrayals among humans (“They’ll step on you every every day!”) and points to a certain carpenter as the truest friend possible. With Shelton and the Gospel Queens (Bobbie Jean Gant and Edna Johnson, plus newcomer Angel McKenzie) delivering a lively call and response, the song itself sounds steeped in ‘70s R&amp;B, as though making a conscious nod to the heyday of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8441-the-staple-singers/"">Staple Singers</a>. Yet, the conviction in their voices rescues the song from any sense of nostalgia, lending it some persuasive topicality beyond its musical reference points. </p>
<p>Roth, producing under his alias Bosco Mann, has put together a band of R&amp;B veterans to back Shelton and the Gospel Queens on <i>Cold World</i>. If they weren’t such fine players, sensitive to the cadence of Shelton’s vocals and the sentiments of these songs, you might think they were hired for their historical connections to artists who likewise blended the secular and the spiritual. Driver himself has played with Sam Cooke and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9072-solomon-burke/"">Solomon Burke</a>; bass player Fred Thomas was a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">JB</a> in the 1970s. Somehow, the music occasionally sounds too Daptone, as though these backing tracks could have been created for Jones or anyone else on the roster. That shouldn’t reflect on Shelton, but should suggest either the label’s somewhat limited sound or Roth’s too-familiar production style.</p>
<p>But the band cover a lot of ground on <i>Cold World</i>, toggling between the reggae-tinged rhythms of “Sinner” and the breezy groove of “Everybody Knows (River Song)”, a cover of the 1965 O.V. Wright tune. Still, it’s Shelton who confidently ties everything together and insinuates a larger story arc in the sequencing: a journey that begins in doubt (“Sinner”) and ends with salvation and gratitude (“Thank You Lord”). If her label defines itself by the past tense, Shelton understands that gospel is rooted in the present (the tribulations we face today) and the future (the promise of eternity in heaven). It may seem like a minor distinction, but on <i>Cold World, </i>it’s the difference between revival and revivalist. </p></div>"|19528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19528-naomi-shelton-the-gospel-queens-cold-world/|7.3|Stephen Deusner

<p>Much of Stack’s reputation comes from his live sets, and his feel for mood and transitions on the first half of the album justifies his reputation as a club DJ. <i>Tell Me I Belong</i> has a narrative ambition not often present on electronic LPs, and Stack takes plenty of time patiently building energy for the album’s early climax, “Reassuring”. Leading up to that track, the listener is taken on a slow climb through the mid-tempo Baltimore club-influenced “Run” and “Below”'s saccharine electro. “Reassuring” is the reward at the top of the mountain, a deep house jam with a screwed-up vocal sample, plaintive R&amp;B keys, and a dancehall shuffle. The track that follows, “Everything to Say”, is the perfect denouement, and if <i>Tell Me I Belong</i> were an EP consisting of these five tracks, it would be hard to find anything wrong with it.</p>
<p>But the second half of the album is a lesser echo of the first, up to and including its vocal-looping climax, “Without”, which, at best, stands as a mere duplicate of “Reassuring”'s charms. Other counterpoints are similarly weak: the blocky stabs at house and B-more club on “Out of Mind” feel random when compared to the precision of “Run”, and the working man's samples-n-synths package on the one-minute, “Ease Up”, while an amusing diversion, could use a little extra weight. </p>
<p>When the second half of <i>Tell Me I Belong</i> finally deviates from the established blueprint, Stack comes through with “Wake”. It’s a full-fledged, album-ending anthem that manages to combine the emotional heights of “Reassuring” and “Without” with the sure-handed patience that marks the album’s superb sequencing. Skip to any two random points within the track, and there’s a chance that they’ll make absolutely no sense in relation to one another. But in real time, these disparate moments are smoothed out by Stack’s ability to shift gears with the speed and serenity of a Formula One driver. ""Wake"" is a reminder of Stack's talent as a storyteller; shame, then, that the narrative of <i>Tell Me I Belong</i> doubles back on itself  halfway through the tale.</p></div>"|19513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19513-jim-e-stack-tell-me-i-belong/|6.5|Jonah Bromwich

There's an obsession with compartmentalizing every last guitar lick or drum beat and planning the listening experience accordingly, almost as if by algorithm. This approach offers an easy way to establish distinctions between artists, but it comes at the expense of a reduced appreciation of metal's liminal spaces and atypical arrangements. Case in point: Brooklyn's visionaries of filth <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30294-mutilation-rites/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Mutilation Rites</a>. However strong the Darkthrone worship may have shone through on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16642-empyrean/"" target=""_blank""><i>Empyrean</i></a>, the band's excellent 2012 debut, their blackened riffs were ultimately overshadowed by their rabid, punkish attitude, unpredictable percussion, and cross-pollinating song-craft. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Two years later, Mutilation Rites return with <i>Harbinger</i>, their second album. Like its predecessor, the new record splits its time between lengthy, metamorphosing epics and thunderous rabble-rousers, with nary a synth or sample in sight. This time around, however, improved sonics and sharpened songwriting streamline the band's venture into the void, recalling a garagey Gorgoroth at some points and a filthier <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a> at others. Frequently, their smoke-enshrouded roar resonates with a sneaky immediacy reminiscent of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2699-mastodon/"" target=""_blank"">Mastodon</a>; with its unstoppable guitar hook and seething, grunge-y coda, “Contaminate” is easily Mutilation Rites' “Blood and Thunder”, while closing dirge “Tactical Means of Ouroboros” would have felt right at home on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5142-remission/"" target=""_blank""><i>Remission</i></a>. Like the Atlanta legends, the quartet exercise mind and muscle equally, striking a difficult balance between galloping polyrhythms and beefy guitars on opener “Black Pyramid”. At the same time, they don't stick around to stargaze for too long; where there's a mournful melodic seep (as on “Exhaling and Breathing In”), a shuddering screech from vocalist George Paul never trails far behind.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Harbringer’s </i>gut-lurching thrills rely heavily on drummer Justin Ennis, formerly of fellow Brooklynites <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22209-tombs/"" target=""_blank"">Tombs</a>. Guided by some arcane intuition, he carves out the violent spaces where the band wreaks havoc and detonates them as he sees fit. On “Suffer the Children”, his kit ricochets between black, death, d-beat, doom, and grindcore temples, repeatedly threatening the track's inevitable collapse across six pulverizing minutes. As the blast-beats bear down on the second half, the song’s kinetic force strengthens in a caustic crescendo that defies logic, endowing the din with unexpected depth. It's a bit of percussive wizardry on the part of engineer Kevin Bernsten, best known for his work with speed demons like Magrudergrind. Snare, cymbal, and bass each carry twice as much weight in his mix, making Ennis’ fills—rather than the riffs of Paul and Michael Dimmitt—the focal points of songs like ""Contaminate” and “Gravitational Collapse”. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In spite of their motions towards transcendence, Mutilation Rites’ complex racket is never accompanied by an elitist aftertaste. Considering their associations with the notoriously overachieving Brooklyn metal scene, that’s both a relief and a blessing—freedom to enjoy the adrenaline rush of <i>Harbinger </i>without getting bogged down by form or philosophy, the sound of four guys paying tribute to chaos the best way they know how. </p></div>"|19509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19509-mutilation-rites-harbinger/|7.5|Zoe Camp

The 2011 album cut former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29141-digable-planets/"">Digable Planets</a> member Ishmael Butler’s opaque mysticism loose on a palette of intricate, dreamy soundscapes provided by resident producer Tendai Maraire, sacrificing traditional songwriting conventions like verses and choruses to sojourn to rap’s frayed edges. Ish’s musings on love resonated in their leveraging of heady imagery with wizened world-weariness; his songs triumphed in their arrangement of familiar ideas into peculiar shapes.<br/><br/>Rather than mining <i>Black Up</i>’s fertile retrofuturist boom-bap further, the group have since decamped to parts unknown. The duo’s latest album <i>Lese Majesty</i> boasts 18 songs grouped into seven suites, with a subtle science fiction theme. If that sounds a bit <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_to_the_Edge_%28Yes_album%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Close to the Edge</i></a>, get used to it. <i>Lese Majesty</i> aims to free the group’s songwriting apparatus from its trademark purposefulness, to chart a course that zags where earlier work zoomed. While the opening suite “The Phasing Shift” leads with three straight cuts in the spirit and form of <i>Black Up</i>, the record doesn't stay in one place for long. From the moment “They Come in Gold” fades into the undulating drone of “Solemn Swears”, it's clear that, for the duo, space is the place.<br/><br/>The “Touch &amp; Agree” suite is a good primer for what to expect from <i>Lese Majesty</i>. “Solemn Swears” builds on a bed of synth pulses and a playful riff from Ish before collapsing into “Harem Aria”, a disorienting romp whose upbeat never hits where it’s supposed to. “Harem” becomes “Noetic Noiromantics”, which peels a few layers back to tease a hook out of the maelstrom only to dissipate as quickly as it congealed. <i>Lese</i>’s individual tracks aren’t so much songs as ramshackle ideas subject to crumble or explode into something unfamiliar at a moment’s notice. The passage through these movements feels like an itinerant drift, a conscious rejection of the methodical drive of its predecessor.</p>
<p><i>Lese</i>’s moves aren’t always subtle, though; the album gets shiftier as it progresses, dispensing with the comfort of thematic unity. The run from “#CAKE” to “Mind Glitch Keytar Theme” flies through tribal drum vamps, Miami bass, horror soundtrack synths, and a frayed 190 BPM house workout in just a few minutes, ramping up the intensity before easing off it with the album closing chillout suite “Murkings on the Oxblood Starway”. This is a producer’s album, constructed to showcase a versatile sound architecture the same way <i>Black Up</i> highlighted Ish’s way with words.<br/><br/>Sometimes that means Ish's vocals are a tool in the production arsenal, distorted and distended rhythmic elements instead of guiding points. In <i>Lese</i>’s more erratic passages, Ish is content to toy around with an intriguing turn of phrase instead of unfurling the impressionistic poetry that electrified <i>Black Up</i>, but that doesn’t mean this is just an assortment of chants and sketches; Ishmael’s showcases are a grounding force for a body of songs fixated on the cosmos.<br/><br/>“Lèse-majesté” is a capital crime in stricter monarchic societies that loosely translates to ""the offending of royalty."" It's an appropriate title for the network of verses Ishmael presents here, which glibly taunt the kings of the modern rap mainstream for slacking on the job. Questioned about Shabazz Palaces' overarching purpose in a <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2014/07/20/332073982/unlocking-the-eclectic-a-conversation-with-shabazz-palaces-ishmael-butler"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent NPR interview</a>, Ish retorted, ""Make no mistake, this is an attack,"" and cuts like ""Suspicion of a Shape"" (""All you guys are quantized"") and “...down 155th in the MCM Snorkel"" (“The type of MC you’d be back then is ‘sucka’”) are rife with bile for feted lesser talents.<br/><br/>Similar to recent albums by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots"">the Roots</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/"">Common</a>, <i>Lese Majesty</i> is an <i>Armageddon</i>-esque suicide mission to crash into rap's consciousness in hopes of tipping it away from a dangerous path. While its peers have set about their objectives this year with a staunch, unblinking seriousness of purpose, Ish is more forgiving. The Rucker reminiscence ""...down 155th in the MCM Snorkel"" recalls the days of doorknocker earrings, Dapper Dan suits, and fair ones without pining for a time machine or hawking staid old school invective. These aren’t condescending “Real Hip-Hop” platitudes: this is a call to arms for hip-hop’s creative fringe to snatch the reins from a power structure more interested in self-preservation than the advancement of the culture. The soul of Shabazz Palaces is pairing next-gen sounds with classic brass-tacks show-and-prove emceeing, and <i>Lese Majesty</i> tugs those extremes as far as they've ever been pulled; that it never shows signs of wear speaks to the strength of the bond.</p></div>"|19631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19631-shabazz-palaces-lese-majesty/|8.2|Craig Jenkins

Case in point: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29244-hooray-for-earth/"">Hooray For Earth</a>. If you consider “alt synth-rock” to be a thing<span>—</span>and you should<span>—</span>any given release from the Brooklyn band could be considered state of the art. In the three-year stretch between their first EP and 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15340-true-loves/""><i>True Loves</i></a>, their aesthetic evolved from a less polychromatic rendering of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"">MGMT</a>’s <i>Mario Paint</i> symphonies to a parallel of the percussive, vaguely mystic electro-pop streamlining of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"">Animal Collective</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5506-yeasayer"">Yeasayer</a>. Three years later, <i>Racy</i>reflects where we’re currently at; this type of band no longer has any pretense of being “indie rock” in anything but a nominal sense.<i> Racy </i>is big, it’s bold, and positions its creators closer to ""pop"", only to reveal them as a pop band by context rather than nature.</p>
<p>And they were in a much more flattering context three years ago. <i>True Loves</i> was stacked with relatively bold, overt singles and equally stacked with the requisite, billowy deep cuts like “Black Trees”, so defined by atmosphere and drums that a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13263-black-trees-hooray-for-earth-cover"" target=""_blank"">doom metal cover by the Atlas Moth</a> maintained its original character. <i>Racy</i> unifies those disparate aims of Hooray For Earth and the result is an album where everything could be <i>the</i> single—which ultimately has the reverse effect, as little stands out amidst its consistent, ingratiating quite-goodness. They’ve once again enlisted producer Chris Coady, who’s worked on records for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave"" target=""_blank"">Cold Cave</a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28423-future-islands"" target=""_blank"">Future Islands</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a>—the guy knows how to make alt synth-rock loud and direct.  Any semblance of roundabout drum circle percussion gets pointed endlessly forward and upward; guitars are no longer choppy, the synthesizers are in bolder neons and fluorescents.</p>
<p>As a result, <i>Racy</i> is just what it promises: sleek, aerodynamic, and defined by its vertical momentum. The entire album is comprised of songs taking flight in some way<span>—</span>while “Keys” zooms skyward like a 747, the title track slowly elevates like a hot air balloon. It can occasionally be thrilling, as with any occasion where the human will for technological advance conquers natural limitations.  And though this is 2014, most bands of Hooray For Earth’s ilk are reminiscent of a time when Big Music was an actual term; when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2"">U2</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26609-echo-and-the-bunnymen"">Echo and the Bunnymen</a> and Big Country inverted post-punk’s negation to create a new, more fantastic, and spiritual state of existence. The songs on <i>Racy</i> follow suit and have a synaesthetic effect; they’re widescreen, panoramic, HD—and I can’t remember for the life of me what actually fills out these expanses.</p>
<p>Noel Heroux is a strong vocalist, maintaining his composure when most in this genre are sucking helium<span>. H</span>is tousled tone has more in common with a garage rocker and no matter how demure he sounds on any given verse, he hits his choruses with gusto. But he’s not really an expressive vocalist, and all of his words slide right off <i>Racy</i>’s glassy surface, such as when he sings, “As soon as I said it/ Immediately regret it”, without any sense of what he said, why he said it, and why it’s regrettable. “Last, First” channels <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY2YPXI__tg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joe Jackson’s “Steppin’ Out”</a> in both the concept and the bouncy synth chords, evoking a night on the town as a kind of spiritual purification (“Socialite, for tonight/ You take me out”).  It just turns out to be another muddled rumination on a relationship in flux <span>—</span>“I was acting over the line/ Saying you were mine.” Is it a breakup song? An argument? A tortured confession about unrequited love? Credit can be due for keeping it open-ended, but like so many other moments on <i>Racy</i>, it <i>feels</i> direct and intentional without revealing the intentions themselves.</p></div>"|19510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19510-hooray-for-earth-racy/|6.4|Ian Cohen

That's also exactly where the Muffs began. There is scarcely a more consistent band in all of American pop-punk; singer-guitarist Shattuck and bassist Ronnie Barnett have been Muffs since 1991, and drummer Roy McDonald is the new kid, having joined in 1994. Nothing on <i>Whoop Dee Doo</i> would have been out of place on any of their five earlier records.</p>
<p>And that's saying a lot, actually: they haven't slowed down or softened their attack, or lost their way with tune-construction. Even Shattuck's voice remains barely touched by time. The scratchy sleepless-night tone she used to reserve for her bloodthirsty end-of-verse howls has crept into most of the rest of her singing, although it's not unwelcome. (As for her habit of inserting little glottal stops into syllables that go on for more than one note—""yoo, oo, ou""—that's more of an acquired taste.)</p>
<p>The Muffs apparently never really broke up, although they spent a while out of the public eye; their biggest recent exposure came when Shattuck was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7231-kim-deal/"">Kim Deal</a>'s stand-in for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a> for six months last year. That role didn't last, but it was an inspired choice on the Pixies' part: the Muffs' instrumental sound had, and still has, more in common with the Pixies than with most of their grunge-era contemporaries. Their songwriting, on the other hand, is very different (they're writing much better songs than the Pixies are these days, too), and it's <i>very</i> heavily inspired by '60s rock 'n' roll. Specifically, mid-'60s British rock'n'roll. More specifically, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13433-rubber-soul/""><i>Rubber Soul</i></a>.</p>
<p>Shattuck doesn't often telegraph the resemblance, and the band's growl-and-bash obscures it, but if you're listening for Beatles-of-'65 nods, they're all over <i>Whoop Dee Doo</i>. ""Like You Don't See Me"" might as well be an answer song to ""You Won't See Me"", ""Where Did I Go Wrong"" recasts the unpredictable phrasing and two-step beat of ""I've Just Seen a Face"" as hardcore, and the first song they released from the new record, ""Up and Down Around"", has a vague resemblance to ""Girl"" underscored by deadpan ""dit-dit-dit-dit"" backing vocals. ""Cheezy"" reaches back a little further—it's ""I Should Have Known Better"" (the opening harmonica solo is the tipoff) by way of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>'s ""Sappy,"" and it's got a stinging hook: ""And I really liked you/Till I got to know you.""</p>
<p>That's another big part of the Muffs' charm: Shattuck's perpetual balancing act between romantic vulnerability and indignant fury. ""Take a Take a Me"" sounds like a love song with a beat for frugging, but closer inspection reveals it to be a threat directed toward a rival (""she could never never never take a take a me—WHAAAAAAA!"") The album's catchiest bridge begins ""And I would like to strangle you or punch you in the face"". She reserves her most venomous slapdowns for variations on the ""freaky little adolescent"" she describes in ""Because You're Sad"", but there's a lot to admire about a 51-year-old rocker's enduring command of her own adolescent freakiness.<i></i></p></div>"|19511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19511-the-muffs-whoop-dee-doo/|7.5|Douglas Wolk

But there’s always been a certain amount of ritual and theater to the violence of hardcore, which is not lost on UltraMantis Black. And how could it be, when the hardcore band’s eponymous frontman is a professional wrestler?</p>
<p>As one of the founding fighters of the independent, Philadelphia-based Chikara wrestling federation, UltraMantis Black—his real name is not public knowledge—has spent the past decade refining his masked identity: an insect-like amalgam of the Japanese superheroes Kamen Rider and, more blatantly, Ultraman. But an ear for music lurks behind that mask. His entrance themes over the years have consisted of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwJ5sl_N96Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cradle of Filth</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef8R0wdWe2E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Man or Astro-man?</a>, and Japanese proto-metal masters <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF3Kux4iJO0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flower Travellin’ Band</a>. So UltraMantis Black has decent taste—which is also evident in his recruitment of Matt Korvette and Brad Fry of Sub Pop noiseniks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5308-pissed-jeans"">Pissed Jeans</a> to record <i>UltraMantis Black</i>, his eight-song hardcore debut.</p>
<p>It’s a violent record. The entire thing weighs in at under 14 minutes, a salvo of short, sharp shocks to the nerve clusters. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C882d7NfR2U&amp;list=PL1C442755F1FAD624&amp;index=2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Biomonster DNA”</a> writhes like a worm on a hook, as the band jabs blastbeats into muscular breakdowns with indiscriminate bloodlust. Yet it’s also focused, potent, and controlled, the force of a wholesale beating condensed to the flick of a finger. The same goes for “Oil and Gas”, a whiplash windup of tension with no hope of release, and “Stockpiling Graves”, a minefield of disorienting screams and dissonant riffs. <i>UltraMantis Black</i>’s precedents are clear—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/242-agoraphobic-nosebleed/"">Agoraphobic Nosebleed</a>’s progressive grind; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjySAis2jSs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Das Oath</a>’s screamo antics; the formative metalcore of pre-<i>Jane Doe</i> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuu0uNshJaw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Converge</a>—but they’re synthesized instinctively and savagely.</p>
<p>The band’s dominant lineage, though, is powerviolence: particularly the mutated strain engineered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2504-the-locust/"">the Locust</a>, only minus the sci-fi keyboards and Dadaist song titles. With his bug-eyed mask and wiseass mystique, <a href=""http://neostarpromotions.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/ultramantis-black-c2a92013-jamie-heim-13.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">UltraMantis Black</a> even looks like he could be a long-lost member of that band—and make no mistake, UltraMantis Black has a wiseass streak a mile wide, at least during his day job as a wrestler. His <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g_QC_nkS64"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ringside persona</a> is one of an utter asshole: speaking in rarified tones, like a cross between some stereotypical English dandy and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-4b8AjPl1I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ed Grimley</a>, he plays up his self-styled role as a cult leader and quasi-mythical being. It’s part of his perverse charm, but there’s one thing he’s never less than serious about: veganism. He sips soy chai during interviews and advocates oatmeal and fresh fruit for breakfast, sounding more like a reader of Michael Pollan and <i>Mother Jones</i> than a villainous overlord set on world domination.</p>
<p>When it comes to being the lead singer of UltraMantis Black, he’s similarly serious, and his poker-faced, militant outrage is one of the record's most startling aspects. “Experiment with the delicate nature of nature/ Faulty technology, widespread crop failure,” he screeches on “Biomonster DNA”, railing against GMOs. Big Pharma gets the boot on “Prescription Culture”: “A prescription for any and all pain/ Best treatment for a billion-dollar cure.” “Oil and Gas” tackles fracking with an almost poignant appeal for preservationism, while “Deepest Ecology” is like being throat-punched with a copy of <i>Silent Spring</i>. It’s classic hardcore righteousness without an ounce of irony, but as with the best politicized hardcore and grind, Ultramantis’ technical, lecture-ready lyrics approach a kind of apocalyptic poetry: “Ecologically regressed to a minimalist existence/ One-sided endosymbiosis, fatal collapse.""</p>
<p>UltraMantis Black may not be a joke, but is he a novelty? He’s backed by two members of Pissed Jeans, after all, an outfit not exactly known for its heartfelt sincerity. Korvette and Fry, to their credit, take a back seat to their leader; while Fry’s haywire guitar in Pissed Jeans sounds almost like its mocking itself, here it’s pounded down into a disciplined, utilitarian barrage. This is not simply sped-up Pissed Jeans with a dude in a mask yelling over the top of it, and the closest <i>UltraMantis Black</i> comes to Pissed Jeans’ grungy nihilism is on the record’s longest track, the three-minute “Gloom of Prosperity”, which alternately plods and thrashes as the singer recites a megaphone-like rant. As gleefully bipolar as it is, there’s no humor in it, gallows or otherwise: “We are told, however, that we have choices/ That we can dream, that we can mold our own future,” UltraMantis howls into the void of encroaching Armageddon. At heart, though, he seems to be clutching at some twisted, bittersweet hope. This is not the same UltraMantis Black, supercilious and snide, who struts around the lucha libre ring with delusions of cartoon godhood. If ever his fans have been given a peek at the man behind the mask, here it is.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, UltraMantis sounds at least as seasoned as anyone else in his group. His phrasing is fractured here, blurry there—as much of an exercise in choreographed chaos as any of his signature finishing moves between the turnbuckles. There are hundreds of bands making music like UltraMantis Black, old and new, in existence right now. What sets UltraMantis apart is his embrace of pageantry, his open admission that catharsis and social consciousness can be stylized as well as served raw. As for the violence: Its just another way to connect.</p></div>"|19567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19567-ultramantis-black-ultramantis-black/|7.4|Jason Heller

<p>Upon a first listen, Parallel Thought's contributions dominate. Their production incorporates all sorts of beat variations, samples, and rapid-fire scratching while still maintaining a pocket of negative space for Gene to fill. Their thorough, deliberate approach is reminiscent of the production adorning tracks from Southerners like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28901-big-krit/"">Big K.R.I.T.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28469-g-side/"">G-Side</a>, but the concepts undergirding the samples and scratching and the busyness of the beats here are unmistakably East Coast-derived.</p>
<p>At first, it feels like <i>Southern Meridian </i>succeeds primarily because of the beats. When analyzed on a line-by-line basis, Gene's lyrics aren’t particularly compelling; “Flo-Town”, for example, includes such clichéd statements as “Haters die slow, fuck 5-0"". But the rapper’s uncanny focus and subtle charm is slowly revealed throughout the album. Lyrically, Gene has very little interest in pogoing from topic to topic as so many of his contemporaries do. He's meticulous in his description of scenes and scenarios, and his best songs unfold like Technicolor panoramas. “Ride With the Southern Child” could easily come off as a cursory love song, but even as he rattles off boilerplate club pick-up lines, Gene manages to seem charismatic, and absorbing. “Split Personality” has a lot in common conceptually with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dr. Dre</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a>’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbw_BxDwdjk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Guilty Conscience</a>”, but Gene goes for pathos over comedy and makes the conceit work on his own terms.</p>
<p>Gene also reveals a surprisingly dynamic mix of flows, especially on the bonus track “Sucka Deal”, where he accelerates through his bars and actually manages to make a song about the music industry compelling. (Caness, the Alabaman member of Parallel Thought, is featured rapping on the track, and his verse is a reminder of how boring songs about the business usuually are.)</p>
<p>Both Gene and Caness are from Muscle Shoals, an area of Alabama that has produced an impressively dynamic music scene—artists like G-Side, <a href=""http://www.blockbeattaz.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Block Beattaz</a> and Bentley all hail from the area, which is also home to the rich history of recording studios like <a href=""http://www.fame2.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FAME</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_Shoals_Sound_Studio"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Muscle Shoals Sound</a>. Rap artists from Muscle Shoals have cultivated a deep, easily identifiable sound, but Parallel Thought’s work on <i>Southern Meridian</i> doesn’t quite fit neatly in with the pack. No wonder then, that it's found a home on Adult Swim’s <a href=""http://video.adultswim.com/music/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Williams Street Records</a>, which has released music by unlikely partnerships like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1186-danger-mouse/"">Danger Mouse</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"">MF Doom</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"">El-P</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"">Killer Mike</a>. <i>Southern Meridian </i>feels like it has more in line with those projects than with much of the Muscle Shoals canon, profiting from a diverse, accepting collaboration between artists who feed off of each other’s differences.</p></div>"|19549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19549-gene-the-southern-child-southern-meridian/|7.0|Jonah Bromwich

And anyway, that binary—which took real shape around 2011, thanks in large part to the clamor around <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a>’s landmark debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15264-house-of-balloons/""><i>House of Balloons</i></a>—has always been more about the audience than about the artist. There are vague aesthetic similarities among R&amp;B artists pegged as “alternative” (or otherwise)—a focus on vibe over narrative, a tendency to distort vocals to the point of disembodiment—but what it more often designates is a certain seal of approval, a go-ahead for guilt-free consumption by whatever your term of choice may be for those who’ve warmed to R&amp;B in the 2010s but approach the bulk of the genre under the protective cloak of irony.</p>
<p><i>Late Nights</i>, at once radio-driven and experimental, shared some of those aesthetics but managed to duck that conversation so thoroughly that it made you question if the conversation was worth having to begin with. Its oddness was approachable from all angles, as Jeremih and a league of ambitious producers (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"">Mike WiLL Made It</a> in his absolute prime, pop soothsayer Tricky Stewart, occasionally Jeremih himself) took cues from the sounds of the underground but never quite presented them as “cool.” All this was especially surprising coming from the guy best known for “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYMxOzxKYYo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Birthday Sex</a>”, a doofy novelty hit that’s endured solely because people continue to  have birthdays. But even then, there were glimmers of promise: in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGbOuZww14g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a 2009 acoustic performance of the same song</a>, he transformed it into something intimate and feather-light, accompanying himself on piano.</p>
<p>When Jeremih initially linked last year with moody L.A. producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28501-shlohmo/"">Shlohmo</a> for <a href=""http://yourstru.ly/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yours Truly</a> and Adidas Originals’ <a href=""http://yourstru.ly/songsfromscratch/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Songs From Scratch</a> series, it wasn’t such an improbable pairing: here was a singer willing to go all in with producers’ stranger impulses working with a beatmaker that possesses omnivorous tendencies, whose gooey sad-boy soundscapes draw from ghostly R&amp;B balladry, abstracted hip-hop percussion, and hissy ambience alike. (The first half of last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17735-shlohmo-laid-out-ep/""><i>Laid Out</i></a> EP could, with very slight stretches of the imagination, be considered some warped form of R&amp;B itself.) That collaboration, “Bo Peep (Do U Right)"", was proof enough: gorgeously smoggy, humid, and sort of tragic despite the surface romance, with Jeremih’s weightless falsetto piercing through the groaning bassline, “Wish somebody would’ve seen us, baby.” It was heavier than Jeremih’s usual stuff, but it worked, at least as a one-off. A year later, the duo aim to replicate its magic on <i>No More</i>, their six-track collaboration; but where Jeremih floated on “Bo Peep,” the majority of the EP falls flat.</p>
<p>Shlohmo’s productions are typically dense and blurry, his bittersweet melodies rendered in smudgy sepia tones and built from intricately arranged layers of what sound like organized anxieties. When there are vocals, they’re often samples; even when they’re not, as with “Don’t Say No”, his lovely 2013 collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"">How to Dress Well</a>, vocals tend to serve as yet another instrument in the mix, rather than the focal point. Though “Bo Peep” proved an exception, Jeremih’s voice isn’t intended for this sort of environment; there’s a translucency to his falsetto that radiates when given the proper space, but gets bogged down by too much outside noise.</p>
<p><i>Late Night</i>’s best moments— “773 Love,” “Fuck U All The Time,” “Go To The Mo”—shared a certain sense of delicacy, their productions defined primarily by negative space. <i>No More</i> could benefit from some of this airiness; instead, it often feels stifling, Jeremih’s voice mired in the layers of hi-hat twitches and bass grumblings. Title track “No More” burbles and quivers yet doesn’t quite move in any particular direction. “Let It Go” is pretty—it’s certainly the best new song on the project—but ultimately reads as a slightly subpar cousin to “Bo Peep”. And when the duo aim for sparseness, on skeletal closing track “The End,” they’re left with a handful of parts and not much whole; Jeremih’s a touch off-key and slightly out of time, and a tacked-on appearance from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a> is a bizarre choice for a finale, entirely at odds with the warm, woozy sensuality of the preceding tracks.</p>
<p>Most questionable here is the inclusion of Shlohmo’s “Fuck U All the Time” remix, the original version of which he released well before the two ever crossed paths. It’s essentially just an extended version of the original, which boasts an additional Jeremih verse packed with mildly cute, mostly embarrassing lines like, “Don’t let the time ticky-icky-icky while I’m snapping off your bra/ And biting on your Vickies.” Moments like that are forgivable, if a bit dorky (and it’s far from the first remix of the song crammed with superfluous verses), but it’s harder to understand the impulse to improve upon a song that draws seductiveness from subtlety by piling more stuff on top—that familiar moaning bassline, those little beeps and clatters. It’s that same impulse that characterizes much of the past few years of so-called alt-R&amp;B: pile on the effects, pitch down the voice, and let 'er rip. That impulse holds <i>No More</i> back from approaching the transcendence of Jeremih and Shlohmo’s first collaboration (or most of <i>Late Nights</i>): too much of the EP feels like a drawn-out remix of a song that didn’t really need it in the first place.</p></div>"|19675.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19675-jeremih-shlohmo-no-more-ep/|6.1|Meaghan Garvey

For many, Common's latest album, <i>Nobody's Smiling</i>, will hold a polarized position in the midst of Chicago's senseless violence, a symbol of all that is right in a genre too often derided for moral depravity and/or artistic bankruptcy. Others will cynically dismiss this latest effort, as Common hasn't lived in Chicago in years but is releasing a record capitalizing on the city's newly gritty national reputation. But Common's not interested in moralizing, nor trendchasing. Although he writes a familiar snapshot of Chicago, its troubles seem a catalyst for his own creativity. The album's most convincing when tackling the push-and-pull conflict between the individual and his hometown, as Common's good intentions are buoyed by memory, generosity, and attentiveness to his craft.</p>
<p>Looming over the album is the specter of Chicago's gun violence and the music which first brought it to our attention; Common's 2011 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16156-common-the-dreamerthe-believer""><i>The Dreamer/The Believer</i></a> was released just weeks before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef"">Chief Keef</a> hit the national radar. So <i>Nobody's Smiling</i> displays some idealism-drain, its black and white cover art reflecting a stripped down sound. Common and longtime producer No I.D. aren't interested in competing with the street sounds emanating from his hometown. Instead, they go for a complementary feel, with old head-friendly percussive loops and blaxploitation rhythms (""Blak Majik,"" ""Speak My Piece,"" ""Hustle Harder""). Common's delivery has a loose, nimble quality throughout, his words tumbling out with practiced ease. His lyrics are writerly, internal rhymes focused on a history he can recall but which seems distant now: ""Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones?/ And Four CHs, Vice Lords, Stony Island on Aces/ The concrete matrix, street organizations, they gave violations, hood public relations.""</p>
<p>Common's approach here is to intertwine his own story with his memories of Chicago in order to forge a connection to the next generation. The use of a Biggie sample on ""Speak My Piece"" is emblematic; when Common was an emerging artist, the young Christopher Wallace spoke powerfully to the same state of mind Chicago's street rappers wrestle with today. ""7 Deadly Sins"", a bonus track on <i>Nobody's Smiling</i>, sounds like another way to integrate a mid-'90s street feel, complete with a ""Ten Crack Commandments""-esque concept and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/"">Wu-Tang</a>-recalling beat. Throughout, Common attempts to speak to everyone, offering bits of wisdom for a new generation while contextualizing for an older, outside audience.</p>
<p>This attempt at generational continuity also explains why Common grants a platform for a phalanx of strong guest stars to shine. Opener ""The Neighborhood"" features Lil Herb, a young street rapper whose memories of his era are more freshly etched in each bar: ""Used to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign/ I been out there three days and I got shot at three times."" Meanwhile, West Side rapper Dreezy's verse on ""Hustle Harder"" argues convincingly that she might be the best bar-for-bar rapper in Chicago right now: ""I could be a lady in the streets, but in the booth I pull triggers/ Shots fired, I go harder than a nigga.""</p>
<p>Other guest artists, like <a href=""http://www.defjam.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Def Jam</a> signees <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32145-vince-staples/"">Vince Staples</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a>, acquit themselves well, providing different points of view on the record's central conflict. Big Sean tones down the usual hamminess, perhaps due to the severity of the subject matter, and catches a slick behind-the-beat flow. But Staples stands out particularly: ""Lean and took a puff and then she gave it to my father/ Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver/ Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler."" But it's poet Malik Yusef who nearly steals the show, appearing at the end of the album's title track and spitting an evocative piece that captures the album's real central paradoxes: ""Now I see how my daddy felt the dark day he discovered that black power didn't keep the lights on."" ""They drilling on my land but ain't no oil to be found / I might be part of the problem."" He hits especially hard while engaging with wordplay in the differences between ""shy"" and ""Chi"": ""Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town?""</p>
<p><i></i>The album's closer, ""Rewind That"", is one of Common's most personal records in quite some time, reflecting on the ups and downs of his relationship with No I.D. and meditating on the loss of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">J Dilla</a>. He  addresses his own conflicted decision to leave the city and people that so greatly shaped some of his best music. Truth is complex, and the popular manichean tensions don't map out so predictably atop ""conscious"" and ""gangster"". That's true for street rappers themselves, who have to navigate an ever-increasing divide between their lives and those of the communities who propelled them to fame. And it's true for Common, too, who had to leave his home to continue his career, and for whom—nearly two decades later—finds that the decision still weighs upon him. <i>Nobody's Smiling</i> is driven by the search for this common denominator.</p></div>"|19608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19608-common-nobodys-smiling/|7.7|David Drake

During his execution, his perception of time, memory, and physical reality begins to warp. He vividly hallucinates, and ultimately he dies, but not before experiencing one last bittersweet spasm of happiness and hope. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4775-the-black-angels/"">The Black Angels</a>’ latest EP, <i>Clear Lake Forest</i>, there’s a song called “An Occurrence at 4507 South Third Street”—and the resemblance to the Bierce story can’t be an accident. It drifts in a kind of murky, death-steeped dreaminess, and then there’s the sick gallows joke at the heart of the song’s chorus: “You keep me hanging on.”</p>
<p>The Black Angels’ fourth and most recent full-length, 2013’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17821-the-black-angels-indigo-meadow/"">Indigo Meadow</a></i>, suffered from a lack of that murky, dreamy atmosphere. It was so hi-fi that it hurt, with no room left for the listener to meet the material halfway—which is part of the function and the fascination of psychedelic music. Psychedelia can be vivid, but it shouldn’t be HD, and the Austin band has corrected that mistake on <i>Clear Lake Forest</i>. Like “Owl Creek Bridge”, there’s ambiguity and space for interpretation, both sonically and lyrically. “An Occurrence at 4507 South Third Street” jerks and pounds on a sinister organ riff, churning up the rotted flotsam of the '60s that Boomers seem happy to forget. “Tired Eyes” and “Sunday Evening” are two of the flat-out catchiest, most dynamic songs the group has ever recorded, with frontman Alex Maas’ trippy croon finding new ways to thread their way through some truly inspired pastiches of Summer-of-Love jangle and echo.</p>
<p>That inspiration hasn’t felt so strong since The Black Angels’ 2006 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9045-passover/"">Passover</a></i>. But that was eight years ago, when they were more locked into a holding pattern of overdriven drones. There’s far more range here, but <i>Clear Lake Forest</i>’s influences tend to feel more like Easter eggs than stepping stones. “Sunday Evening” is a blob of psyche-pop bubblegum that’s as sweet as (but also more sour than) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIAzQ6M2Bow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Lemon Pipers</a>; “Diamond Eyes” summons <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpGEeneO-t0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tommy James</a>-level tremolo and reverb, even as it lets the oscillations fall in and out of synch with the beat in a bleary smear of rhythmic phasing. As psychedelic influences go, these are not deep, and so “An Occurrence at 4507 South Third Street” invokes the smoky menace of Brecht/Weill’s “Alabama Song” through the middleman of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX42_3ZKv8c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Doors’ cover</a>, which is almost shamefully mimicked.</p>
<p>The mishandling of influences has long been a problem of the Black Angels, although it’s also been part of the thrill of seeing them evolve. At the least, they’ve always been open about paying homage to their heroes, right down to the group’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">Velvet Underground</a>-referencing name. But on one of <i>Clear Lake Forest</i>’s worst tracks, “Linda’s Gone”, that worship once again crosses over into near parody; the song’s taut, stuttering lead guitar is a far too on-the-nose reference to VU’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGqwy_DQnS4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Run Run Run”</a>, it manages to sound reverent and cavalier at the same time, and not in a good way.</p>
<p>The EP’s other low point, “The Executioner”, is a soggy wad of weak blotter acid that serves only one real purpose: It links to the lyrics of “An Occurrence at 4507 South Third Street”, right down to the line “A rope for your sins”, reinforcing the loose concept winding through the record. The Black Angels deserve credit for attempting what is, in essence, a mini-concept album rendered in subtle, muted shades. It’s a lot to tackle in seven songs, but there’s a depth and richness in both texture and songwriting that show glimpses of a new direction, one that might free them from their own drone-rock noose.</p></div>"|19566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19566-the-black-angels-clear-lake-forest/|6.6|Jason Heller

It’s a strategy with which Adam Freeland is well familiar. While the veteran British beatmaker’s fondness for boisterous breaks always aligned him spiritually with arena-rattling rock—as manifest in his white-label remixes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">the White Stripes</a>’ “Seven Nation Army” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit”—over the past decade, that influence has become evermore explicit. After kicking off his 2005 <i>Back to Mine</i> comp with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/91-and-you-will-know-us-by-the-trail-of-dead/"">Trail of Dead</a> track, Freeland went all-out for his 2009 artist album, <i>Cope</i>, enlisting a veritable VH1 special of notorious noisemakers, including Tommy Lee, Marilyn Manson’s Twiggy Ramirez, Brody Dalle, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">the Pixies</a>’ Joey Santiago, and Devo’s Jerry Casale. However, rather than join the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"">Justice</a> in the indie-disco champagne room, <i>Cope</i> became something of an instant anachronism, a dance album reliant on rock-star cameos released at a time when dance producers were on the verge of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8798-skrillex/"">becoming rock stars themselves</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the cool reception to <i>Cope</i> has inspired Freeland to plot his current crossover move from an entirely different direction, concealing his identity within a collaborative project and deploying a sound that doesn’t so much thunderously rain down from above as seep up from the sewers. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32382-the-acid/"">The Acid</a> is a three-way union between Freeland, L.A. producer (and <a href=""http://stevenalepa.com/music_technology/dubspot-ableton-live-tutorials-w-nalepa-week-1-add-life-your-pads"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">certified Ableton Live instructor</a>) Steve Nalepa, and Ry Cuming, a.k.a. RY X, an Australian singer/songwriter (and one-time Sara Bareilles collaborator) in the moodily romantic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/494-jeff-buckley/"">Jeff Buckley</a>/young <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke"">Thom Yorke</a> mold who scored a minor chart hit last year in Europe with the haunting ballad “Berlin.” (The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFXN20bpWtY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">D’Angelo-esque NSFW video</a> probably helped.) As legend has it, the trio met a house party in Los Angeles last year, but the music they create together is better suited to the completely opposite scenario: insomnia-riddled nights spent tossing and turning in a windowless flat, with nothing to amuse yourself with but your most depraved fantasies and deepest regrets.</p>
<p>If Freeland’s <i>Cope</i> synthesized and streamlined the various strains of mid-2000s dancefloor-directed indie, The Acid’s debut full-length, <i>Liminal</i>, does the same for post-dubstep British rock: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11438-third/"">Portishead’s <i>Third</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx"">the xx</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15149-the-king-of-limbs/""><i>The King of Limbs</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"">James Blake</a>. This Acid bears no hallucinogenic qualities, but rather slow-burn, corroding effects: songs that begin with a drip—snare-rim taps, synthetic handclaps, bass frequencies that throb like a merciless migraine—and eventually leave burn marks. But where the Acid’s immediate antecedents were attempting to push their songwriting to minimalist, brutalist extremes, <i>Liminal</i> is something of a recoil move back toward the realm of pop accessibility, an effort to extract warm blood from cold concrete and offset the bleak with some sleek. (Or, put another way, it’s a savvy reconstruction of sullen source material into potential sync-license gold.)<i> <br/></i></p>
<p><i>Liminal</i> may be unforgivingly austere in presentation, but it’s not without a desire to uplift—while Cuming doesn’t so much sing these 11 tracks as tremble through them, his bruised croon and spectral harmonies at least serve as flashlight-sized beacons to guide you through the album’s shadowy, greyscale terrain. The first words we hear him sing on <i>Liminal</i> are “I need your love”, and the songs that follow catalogue his various ploys to get it, from restraining-order-worthy lechery (the “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00PdHIPjaWQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Machine Gun</a>”-loaded “Creeper”) to egomaniacal posturing (“Fame”—not a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">Bowie</a> cover, but a similarly sardonic comment on starfuckery) to gentle reconciliation (the acoustic reprieve “Ra”). His is a deft highwire dance between serving as album’s emotional center and dissolving into a textural detail; by the end of the penultimate “Clean”, Cuming’s titular incantation has become the song’s click track.</p>
<p>But while <i>Liminal</i> is a testament to the Acid’s breadth of vision and production prowess—seamlessly incorporating everything from subterranean techno and avant-R&amp;B to proggy sci-fi soundscapes and sad-bastard bedroom folk—its uniformly predictable pacing, with every song painstakingly built up from a pause to a pulse, grows wearing over a 51-minute stretch. Curiously, <i>Liminal</i>’s release was previewed by its most atypically lucid, palpably angst-ridden track, “Basic Instinct”, whose raw, distorted-guitar-driven climax is seemingly at odds with the meticulous mise-en-scenery in effect everywhere else on this record. But its late appearance here proves strategic: when, on the chorus, Cuming declares he’s “coming up for air,” it’s a welcome relief for our lungs as much as his.</p></div>"|19595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19595-the-acid-liminal/|6.7|Stuart Berman

It’s a harrowing tone, a somehow glowing rush of cold that Carlson lets linger. He eventually flicks a few isolated notes over the lonesome drone, letting them fade into the backdrop like ghosts vanishing against the night. When the 30-second instrumental goes almost quiet, Carlson strums a few quick, bright chords, like he’s willed the sun to rise again. It’s a moment of hope that borders on optimistic, but it barely lasts 10 seconds before Carlson shifts to the snarling, aching blues figure of “Gold XIV”.</p>
<p>That’s the general temperament of <i>Gold</i>, which comprises 24 instrumental vignettes that originally served as the score for a <a href=""http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70270789?trkid=2361637"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2013 film</a> that chronicled the ruinous journey of seven German immigrants into the northwest <a href=""https://content.lib.washington.edu/extras/goldrush.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">during the Klondike Gold Rush at the tail of the 19th century.</a> It’s often been suggested that Carlson’s despondent instrumentals with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>—both the monolithic early iteration that established drone metal as a genre and the latter-day take known for its blues-crawl refinement—would serve as suitable soundtracks for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0565092/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">film renditions of Cormac McCarthy’s books. </a>The westward Klondike trek killed thousands, subjecting the naïve to the abject nature of untamed wilderness and lawless humanity, so <i>Gold</i> is a litany of awful events, where hardscrabble characters endure painful deaths and existential crises, abject loneliness and corrupted dreams. It is, at least, in the McCarthy milieu, finally offering an appropriate cinematic environment for the slow sweep of Carlson’s guitar.</p>
<p>In the movie itself, Carlson’s miniature instrumentals serve mostly as frames, musical borders that guide transitions between scenes and help reinforce moods. But you can trace the same worry, regret, uncertainty and foolhardy aspiration that define the movie through the pieces, too. Together, “Gold III” and “Gold IV” form a brief miasma of self-defeat, each note that Carlson elicits suddenly swallowed by the noisy roar of his amplifier; every picked string is the start of a trip that stands no chance of success.</p>
<p>“Gold XIX,” one of the longer numbers here, staggers along the edge of a slow, angled melody, a precipice rising above a dangerous descent. By track’s end, though, Carlson can barely move through the riff, his motion beset by whorls of noise and the rising wash of Davies’ cymbals. It’s the sound of trouble morphing into terror. The sparkling, if sullen, theme of “Gold XXIII” renders halcyon moments of deliverance. Whether through the release of death or the relief of a stream and clean water, the at-risk adventurers seem to find some relief, maybe even a mirage of it. Carlson lets the end of each phrase float skyward, ascending toward <i>anything</i> else, anywhere but here.</p>
<p>The music on <i>Gold</i> isn’t difficult. The riffs are simple patterns that most anyone with a guitar and a sense of scales could soon pick out. They’re largely unadorned, too, accompanied only by splashes of cymbals and, once, a bass drum from Earth drummer and Carlson savior Adrienne Davies. That might make <i>Gold </i>a hard sell for many. Both the rhythmic grace of recent Earth and the overwhelming volume of early Earth—the band’s central assets for many—are all but absent. But the twist, and the real feat of <i>Gold</i>, comes instead in the guitarist’s simultaneous control and exploration. These are mostly solitary conversations between Carlson, his instrument, his amplifier, and a few effects pedals. Sometimes, it seems, he’s playing pieces of riffs only to hear what they sound like when they decay; at other times, he repeats fragments of melodies in a process of accretion, their repetition building until he can coax feedback from a gently picked purr.</p>
<p>To that end, <i>Gold</i> suggests a crossroads of the dual versions of Earth, where the deliberate melancholy of the latter fuels the amplifier worship of the former, albeit in a much more restrained and reserved space. In their own modest way, these 24 pieces suggest systems music, where the configuration of the guitarist in a room with his guitar and its accessories is more important than the input of what he actually plays. It’s a system with a predisposition for the forlorn, a ghost in the machine that allows these snippets to work onscreen and off.</p></div>"|19542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19542-drcarlsonalbion-gold/|7.2|Grayson Haver Currin

Even among broad genre tags, both “country” and “funk” are incredibly elastic terms. Put them together and somehow they stretch even further. Never a set scene and not quite a movement, country funk was just something in the air during the late '60s and early '70s, when the give and take between what is generally considered “white” music and what is generally deemed “black” music was at its most open and open-minded.</p>
<p>That unlikely marriage inspired <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=light+in+the+attic"">Light in the Attic</a>’s first <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16886-country-funk-1969-1975/"">Country Funk</a></i> collection in 2012, which sounded revelatory because it reveled in the slippery quality of its own premise. In 16 songs, the comp showed how artists from different locations, backgrounds, and genres combined these two seemingly disparate traditions in new and often surprising ways, as though there were infinite variations of country funk. So it’s startling—and even a bit dismaying—that the label’s second volume stretches those two terms until they almost snap. Most everything on <i>Country Funk Vol. 2</i> is self-evidently funky, although a few songs sound more like country tunes with a prominent drum track. When it’s Jackie DeShannon butchering “The Weight”, it’s a problem. But when Dillard &amp; Clark covers the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a>’ “Don’t Let Me Down” or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/648-jj-cale/"">JJ Cale</a> waxes romantic about the “Cajun Moon”, who’s complaining about semantics?</p>
<p>If <i>Vol. 1</i> was about mapping the country funk trend via trucker GPS to show how widespread these sounds were, <i>Vol. 2</i> is more about showing just how high up the ladder these ideas went. The new tracklist is peppered with familiar names, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4456-townes-van-zandt/"">Townes Van Zandt</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9619-kenny-rogers/"">Kenny Rogers</a>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5219-dolly-parton/"">Dolly Parton</a>’s “Getting Happy” boasts a ridiculously effervescent chorus and a runaway snare drum that flirts with country disco, and she sells the tune by virtue of her light vocal touch. When she recorded it in 1974, Parton had recently ended her long partnership with Porter Wagoner and had barely established herself as a solo artist. Released the same year as “Jolene” and “I Will Always Love You”, “Getting Happy” reveals just how musically omnivorous Parton was at this point in her career.</p>
<p>At times <i>Vol. 2</i> is driven as much by its performers’ personalities as by the songs’ syncopated backbeats. Just a few years before <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Headed_Stranger"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Red-Headed Stranger</i></a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanted!_The_Outlaws"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Wanted! The Outlaws</i></a> made him the most popular man in country music, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3107-willie-nelson/"">Willie Nelson</a> was still tinkering with his redneck-hippie sound on “Shotgun Willie”, the title track to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_Willie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his 1973 album</a>. It’s a trip hearing Nelson in this setting: As the rhythm section struts and the Memphis Horns punctuate the groove, his nylon-string guitar zigs and zags effortlessly around the beat, as though taunting his band. In his signature stoned cadence, Nelson sings about the misperceptions of country life, and you can hear both the mischievous humor and cold derision in his voice when he gets to the verse about the KKK wizard selling sheets on the family plan.</p>
<p>Funk, it turns out, was a way to loosen country up a bit, to move it away from its stodgy conservatism. “Shotgun Willie” is only one of several songs on <i>Vol. 2</i> that confronts and sometimes satirizes the cultural divide between the establishment and the counterculture. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23425-bobby-darin/"">Bob Darin</a>’s “Me and Mr. Hohner” describes a hippie’s run-in with cops in South Philly, and the relentless harmonica stomps evokes the danger of the situation. (He’s the unlikely hero of both volumes, and hopefully it’s only a matter of time before Light in the Attic reissues his 1969 album <i>Commitment</i>.)</p>
<p>Kenny Rogers’ encounter with the law is much less fraught on the First Edition’s “Tulsa Turnaround”, which may be the highlight of <i>Vol. 2</i>. Opening with the narrator on the run after getting the mayor’s daughter stoned, the song was widely covered in the early '70s, with recordings by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18771-three-dog-night/"">Three Dog Night</a>, Goose Creek Symphony, and weirdly enough Helen “I Am Woman Hear Me Roar” Reddy. But this may be the ultimate version of the song, thanks to the rhythm section’s narcotized groove and the gritty chagrin in Rogers’ voice as he dispenses outlaw wisdom: “If a man’s gonna eat fried chicken, he’s gotta get greasy.”</p>
<p><i>Vol. 2 </i>may lack the sense of purpose and discovery that defined <i>Vol. 1</i>, which remains one of the best reissue comps of the 2010s. But credit Light in the Attic for digging deep, for avoiding the obvious, and for rescuing obscurities like Jim Ford’s bizarre b-side “Rising Sign” and Willis Alan Ramsey’s “Northeast Texas Women”, a wry dose of back-porch funk that closes the album. Similar series, including <i>Country Got Soul</i> and <i>Dirty Laundry: The Soul of Black Country</i>, stopped after just two volumes, but the label’s adventurous approach may give <i>Country Funk</i> a much longer life. <i>Vol. 2</i> proves there’s more than enough country funk out there to fill a good <i>Vol. 3</i>.</p></div>"|19604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19604-various-artists-country-funk-volume-ii-1967-1974/|7.6|Stephen M.

Last year's crown jewel was something called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiVe8qePd3Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hackney Parrot""</a>, which pushed the unstable syncopations of breakbeat to such cartoonish extremes that the track seemed to barely touch the ground, like a stone skipped hard across a pond. Russell is indebted to the past but not a slave to it, and the same indifference that might make him frustrating to dance-music purists is also what might make him appeal to people who don't care about dance music one way or the other.  </p>
<p>Regardless of how you classify it, his music is hard and appears to be getting harder. <i>Rough 2</i>, his third single for Belgium's <a href=""http://www.randsrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R&amp;S</a> label in the past year, is a smartly titled piece of work, suggesting not only a texture but a state of indeterminate completion, differentiated only by a number. Most of the sounds on it seem borderline-broken, either from bad maintenance or general overuse. But if the palette is industrial, the decay is reassuringly human. By the end of <i>Rough</i>'s three tracks—which arc from funky and coherent to forbiddingly abstract—I feel the same mild, anthropomorphizing pity I feel for a boombox running low on batteries. It's machine music, minus the implied invincibility.</p>
<p>Nothing here is as immediate or durable as ""Hackney Parrot"" but nothing is as conservative either. If Russell doesn't seem as fully formed as period-piece masters like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31735-special-request/"">Special Request</a> (who <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSR3jNZBZlo&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remixed</a> ""Hackney"" last year) it's because his music isn't as narrowly defined. Consistency comes at sake of experiment, brand identity at the sake of progress, et cetera. What <i>Rough</i> does demonstrate is range and willingness to take chances. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29870-blawan/"">Blawan</a>, another young producer whose releases have been tough as rocks and intriguingly all over the place, Russell is working in multiple directions, a polyglot and a dabbler, more interesting when taken as a whole than piece by piece.  I'll be curious to hear <i>Rough 3</i>.</p></div>"|19666.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19666-tessela-rough-2-ep/|6.8|Mike Powell

Presley is a highly prolific songwriter who compulsively writes and records skewed tunes to a four-track tape recorder in his bedroom. This budget conscious home studio setup has given his music—most of which has been released via the labels <a href=""http://www.woodsist.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Woodsist</a> and <a href=""http://www.castlefacerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Castle Face</a>—a distinctly wobbly and elastic sound. Midway through, a song might slip suddenly into an entirely different set of chord changes, as if Presley had simply stopped and pressed record again on another idea. Sometimes a track will lurch forward or backward in tempo as a result of a bump or tweak to the recorder’s pitch knob; the drums are usually little more than single-bar breaks snipped out of other rock songs and haphazardly strung together into off-kilter loops.</p>
<p>But by the time of 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17850-white-fence-cyclops-reap/""><i>Cyclops Reap</i></a>, Presley had gotten handy with that tape machine, and the strange transitions and shaky rhythm tracks started to seem like a natural and indispensable part of White Fence’s headspace.<i> For The Recently Found Innocent</i>, Presley’s debut for <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drag City</a>, is the first White Fence LP to be recorded outside the confines of his home—but it’s not as if he’s moved into Muscle Shoals. The recording quality a modest step up at best, with Presley swapping out four-tracks for eight and his bedroom for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a>’s garage. It’s a change in pace, but not necessarily a nudge out of White Fence’s comfort zone. Segall and Presley collaborated together on 2012’s excellent split LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16558-ty-segall-white-fence-hair/""><i>Hair</i></a>, and they have similar sensibilities when it comes to guitar solo, fuzz pedals, and out-there production tricks. </p>
<p>As a result, some of the wonky studio artifacts from Presley’s bedroom days have mostly been preserved, which is a good thing. Though Presley’s music takes melodic inspiration from ’60s psychedelic pop—both British weirdos like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/298-syd-barrett/"">Syd Barrett</a>, and West Coast folk-rockers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22337-buffalo-springfield/"">Buffalo Springfield</a>—it’s rare that his songs cop their druggy feel from fuzz pedals or delays. Instead, weird tape tricks and glitches do the work by skewing the listener’s perception of time.</p>
<p>Presley is also a better lyricist than your average <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuggets_(series)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Nuggets</i></a> devotée. He has a talent for making surreal psychobabble sound musical, and for implying a sense of narrative in verses that aren’t immediately understandable. But there's often a clear intent in the songs that's enhanced by the gonzo wordplay. On “Like That"", Presley half-jokingly pines for lifestyle upgrades that prove to be out of reach on an underground rock salary—silver gates, disposable income, less attention from police. ""Clean and sharp and always laughing/... Police see us but don't see us,” he sings. “I want to live like that.”</p>
<p>Last year, Castle Face released a <a href=""http://www.castlefacerecords.com/products/white-fence-live-in-san-francisco"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">live White Fence record</a> that was recorded with a full backing band, a tight and energetic reading of songs from Presley’s back catalog that stretched all the way back to his self-titled debut. For the first time, you could hear White Fence outside the context of Presley’s four-track, and it sounded pretty huge; even his grimiest tracks came alive in a way that the tapes didn't always suggest. It wasn’t unreasonable to hope for something along those lines from Presley’s first non-bedroom LP, but in comparison, <i>To The Recently Found Innocent</i> is fairly subdued. It's a record shot through with feelings of anxiety and anger seemingly related to money, art, and other artists. Presley's finally made a step into the outside world, but it hasn't made him particularly comfortable. </p></div>"|19545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19545-white-fence-for-the-recently-found-innocent/|7.0|Aaron Leitko

Drawing upon 1980s jangle-drone touchstones from <a href=""http://www.flyingnun.co.nz/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flying Nun</a> to <a href=""http://4ad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4AD</a> (and contemporary variations thereof), their songs are made of radiant colours, clean contours, and propulsive rhythms—but behind the immaculate exterior lies an unshakeable mental fogginess. The band’s self-titled full-length debut feels not unlike embarking on a morning rush-hour commute on just three hours sleep—a sense of feeling simultaneously present and absent. However, in this case, there’s no readily available grande Americano to shake you out of your somnambulant state.</p>
<p>It’s somewhat ironic that Melted Toys have found their most visible champion in fellow San Franciscan <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30840-christopher-owens/"">Christopher Owens</a>, who invited the group to open dates on his <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17529-lysandre/"">Lysandre</a> </i>tour last year. Where Owens has established himself as the most guileless songwriter in America, Melted Toys mouthpiece Steven Harkins seems almost aggressively vague—and it’s not like the band's sound is so dense as to overpower him. While dream-pop is traditionally reliant on texture and haze, Harkins isn’t getting drowned out by noise; it's more like his mic has been dipped in a vat of Vaseline.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> In lieu of decipherable lyrics, he’s content to let the mere tone of his voice and the band’s expressive, often gorgeous guitar interplay do most of the communicating for him. (Or, failing that, they’ll just give the songs titles like “Bummed Out.”)</span></p>
<p>It wasn’t always this way: Melted Toys’ seven-song 2011 EP, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/melted-toys/sets/washed-dried-ep-1/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Washed &amp; Dried</i></a>, may have possessed a primitive, demo-like quality and murkier post-punk aesthetic, but Harkins' words were, for the most part, easy enough to parse, and even introduced an element of playfulness to a normally dour subgenre. And yet the album’s most fully realized track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5411-the-chills"">the Chills</a>-esque “Come On”, was also its most emotionally ambiguous, with Harkins introducing the distant but affective vocal style that’s been promoted to the defining feature of the band’s debut. “Come On” has been re-recorded here, yet we’re no closer to unlocking the song’s secrets; it remains a silhouette, albeit rendered by a brighter, more powerful backlight. In contrast to <i>Washed &amp; Dried</i>, this self-titled release (written following a sojourn to Japan and Taiwan) is more a case of <i>Dried &amp; Washed</i>—Harkins is colouring between more clearly defined lines, but still using blobs and smears.</p>
<p>As per the standard set by “Come On,” it’s an approach that works best when the band tap into their latent sense of urgency (like on the early-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"">R.E.M.</a> drive of “Horizons,” or the “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKfJEv3SreQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ping Pong</a>”-ed pop of “Always”), with the blurred vocals effectively serving as the vapor-trail exhaust to the band’s accelerated motion. But it can prove frustrating when the band slow down and stretch out: “A Postcard” boasts the album’s most beguiling groove, setting a shuffling funk to dew-soaked fretboard fills straight out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"">Mac DeMarco</a>’s tiki-lounge beer cooler, but even in these more comfortably intimate surroundings, Harkins remains evasive. And when the emotional temperature turns more temperate (as it does on the album’s second half), the songs are simply left to coast on pretty guitar lines, shimmering synths, and breezy backbeats, perilously toeing the line between bliss and blasé. Like their namesake, Melted Toys’ willfully warped nature can get in the way of their utility.  </p></div>"|19594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19594-melted-toys-melted-toys/|6.3|Stuart Berman

Cribbing the best bits from a long line of outré acoustic guitarists, Bachman's taken an academic approach to the wide-ranging styles once herded under the umbrella of ""American Primitivism,"" and on his newest LP, <i>Orange Co. Serenade</i>, he sculpts his work into a comprehensive thesis.</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Where Bachman once made stylistic leaps in between songs, he now ambles effortlessly. Opener ""Blue Mass"" leans on a lurching drone to underpin its melodic play, which couldn't be farther from the nimble-fingered twang of ""Pig Iron"" that shows up just two tracks later. Bachman has gotten better at using these interstitial moments to stitch together his disparate interests. </p>
<p class=""p2"">Despite the fact that the seams show less frequently, Bachman nonetheless retains his adventurous approach to the acoustic guitar. Whether relying on subtle slide flourishes, as on ""Little Lady Blues"", or on the slippery, barely-there melodic leads that mark ""Up and Down the C &amp; O"", he uses the familiar language of American folk music to conjure a quietude that's unique to his particular brand of guitar work. Even the tracks with more locomotive fingerpicking, like ""Pig Iron"" or the dreary ""And Now I Am Born to Die"", use minimal melodic movement as a way of eliciting stillness from that apparent motion. </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Though the record is largely uniform in its instrumentation, Bachman still leaves plenty of room to ramble. Unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29384-william-tyler/"">William Tyler</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31339-steve-gunn/"">Steve Gunn</a>'s interpolations of pop structures into instrumental guitar music, Bachman largely leaves his melodic lines open ended. Even the title track, the only track on the record that comes close to possessing a proper refrain, swells to the fullest expanses of its three-and-a-half minute runtime while exploring variations on its loping theme, until Bachman wipes it away with smears of slide work. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">On <i>Orange Co. Serenade</i>, Bachman delves into the joyous (""Little Lady Blues"") and the desolate (""We Would Be Building"") with the same amount of gleeful fascination. The album underscores all the little emotional breakthroughs that Bachman has made over his career thus far, but it also serves as a reminder that he's more interested in the act of discovering rather than the discoveries themselves.</span></p></div>"|19605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19605-daniel-bachman-orange-co-serenade/|6.8|Colin Joyce

Take <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27831-la-roux/"">La Roux</a>, a Grammy-winning synth-pop project whose music scans as ""'80s"" despite having no perfect corollary in the 1980s. It is crisp and modern, but cheerful, too, like a <a href=""http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/contemporary/images/PatrickNagel-Unknown-009.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Nagel</a> in <a href=""http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02395/a-bigger-splash_2395909b.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hockney color</a>, or the diminuitive little ""i"" in Apple products—the machine that wants you to take it home and make it your pal. Someone could use it to sell things, and they have. </p>
<p>Their first album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13181-la-roux/""><i>La Roux</i></a>, was an instant success, debuting at No. 2 in their native England, inspiring remixes by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a> and guest spots by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>, and opening the door for an inevitable marathon of TV and festival appearances. They were a duo then, singer/songwriter Elly Jackson and producer Ben Langmaid; she a walking magazine cover with hair like an <a href=""http://api.ning.com/files/USRkO2Qfv2QKEA13dyZ6T8JVuRnSNUkM6qVWn1UzyWUUIrLQeOGzlIaU7hHSa*ZWUkYaQ77U14imvmeR0Cgu1xWj6b7TBJT6/LaRouxPaperCoverSept6.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ice-cream cone</a> and he an older guy so disinterested in keeping public face that he let Jackson tour alone. After four years of rumors and false starts, Jackson announced that Langmaid had left.</p>
<p>Langmaid or not, La Roux still sound like La Roux: slick, bright, and instantly familiar. The music on <i>Trouble in Paradise</i> breathes more than it did on their debut, with slower tempos and less of an emphasis on the vacuum-sealed sound of electronics—a reminder that funk was made by people before they had the machines to make it for them. Jackson has loosened up a little too. No longer the irritable pixie routine of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk8eJh4i8Lo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bulletproof""</a>, her delivery has become both sultry and anxious, stiffening up in the middle of lines about sexual curiosity before shivering away into vibrato. That modernist tower of hair has turned into a suggestive swoop.</p>
<p>Sex, generally, becomes a stand-in for everything that gives Jackson the willies, whether excitement or insecurity or some intoxicating mix of the two. ""Oh you make me happy in my everyday life/ Why must you keep me in your prison at night?"" she sings on ""Cruel Sexuality"", a suggestion of the gap between companionate love and something a little less sanitary. On the other hand, I don't know what to make of ""He never answers the phone/ Oh I'll bet money money money/ I'll bet/ He's at the sexotheque,"" other than to say that ""sexotheque"" sounds like a word made up by someone who has heard of sex but doesn't yet know how it works.</p>
<p>The familiarity of Jackson's sound is a virtue and a liability. Listening to <i>Paradise</i> for the first time, I kept feeling like I'd already heard it, only to realize I was mistaking each song for the one before it. Other times I stopped halfway through because I wanted something the music couldn't give me: surprise. Then again, the music probably isn't built for surprise. For all Jackson's personal struggle and exploration, <i>Paradise</i> feels like a safe record, calibrated for the comfort of an imagined audience, working at its best when it becomes almost invisible—the accessory to the experience and not the experience itself. </p></div>"|19665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19665-la-roux-trouble-in-paradise/|6.5|Mike Powell

If punk represented a new year zero for rock to some, for others it carried all the hallmarks of a past worth digging up and fusing with its abrasive form. This is the punk that takes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8319-jerry-lee-lewis/"">Jerry Lee Lewis</a> as its starting point instead of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">the Stooges</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>. It’s unashamedly backwards-looking, caught somewhere between the precipice gazing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"">Nick Cave</a> in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22521-the-birthday-party/"">Birthday Party</a> days and the plastic Elvis front Jon Spencer took in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2205-the-jon-spencer-blues-explosion/"">Blues Explosion</a>. It wouldn’t work without the robust commitment of singer Dale Barclay, who’s spitting and cursing one minute (“I’m a Vampire”) then lost at the end of his tether over a woman the next (“Heading for Heartbreak”). The whiff of pomade may be palpable, but so is the air of commitment.</p>
<p>There are two distinct parts to <i>Amphetamine Ballads</i>, the four-piece band’s debut album for indie behemoths <a href=""http://www.dominorecordco.us/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Domino</a>. The first half is full of Barclay falling to the floor, lying prostrate, kicking against everything around him. By the album’s close, with an actual ballad titled “Tiger By the Tail”, there’s tasteful Spanish guitar and a deep air of surrender. Watching Barclay get there is this album’s greatest asset, setting an overall narrative to a series of songs that would otherwise be struggling for air amid the morass of greasy material by countless other bands in this vein. “Nighttime” is typical of the band’s vigor, with vicious slide guitar riffs overlapping pounding drums and the odd lyrical clunker (“I’m a soul sucker, I’m here to suck your soul”). Barclay’s not the strongest writer, but he overcomes it by throwing everything of himself into the music—on “Swamp Song” he dispenses with words altogether and simply screams, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6491-david-yow/"">David Yow</a>-style.</p>
<p>Cave’s Birthday Party era is going to be a constant comparison point for the Amazing Snakeheads, but most of the time they appear to be working through various descendents of Cave’s style. “Heading for Heartbreak” works along the same lines as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallon_Drunk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gallon Drunk</a>’s distinctly North London take on Cave’s blues, recalling their standout track <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynS-VOVsTbI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“You Should Be Ashamed”</a>. Elsewhere, the band works in a bubblegum edge on “Here It Comes Again”, mirroring the pop-garage approach of the earliest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">White Stripes</a> material, while “Flatlining” hurtles toward <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"">the MC5</a> with Barclay at his authoritarian best as he rips shreds out of his vocal cords. The join between the different sides of the band isn't easily glued together—when they stretch out into the seven-minute “Every Guy Wants to Be Her Baby” it feels like momentum gained has suddenly been lost, especially as nothing strong enough happens to sustain its runtime.</p>
<p>If the Amazing Snakeheads sound like a drunk stumbling around looking for the next bar at the close of this album, it’s at least an appropriate way for them to operate. This is music cast in the after hours world inhabited by the characters of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001139/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tom DiCillo</a>’s <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104567/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Johnny Suede</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28502-jim-jarmusch/"">Jim Jarmusch</a>’s group of Memphis drunks from <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097940/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Mystery Train</i></a>, if not quite (yet) breathing the same air of total fatalism as <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712947/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nicholas Ray</a>’s <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040872/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>They Live By Night</i></a>. <i>Amphetamine Ballads</i> doesn’t come bearing a fully formed vision of a band, carving out insight with switchblades right from the start. At its worst, you can at least hear where Barclay is yearning to get to—that transient place where acrimony collides into reflection then rebounds back again. There are a handful of moments here when he turns himself inside-out over the course of a song, bringing him into the orbit of those artists he so obviously idolizes. Now he just needs to figure out how to emulate his starting position.</p></div>"|19640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19640-the-amazing-snakeheads-amphetamine-ballads/|6.4|Nick Neyland

Starting with 1986’s home-recorded <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucial_Squeegie_Lip"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Crucial Squeegie Lip</a>, </i>Freeman and his best friend Mickey Melchiondo, recording as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"">Gene and Dean Ween</a>, aimed to create a sound (and life) experience that was extremely “fucked-up, in a good way,” as Melchiondo describes it. What #based is for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a>—a good-natured <i>raison d’etre</i> doubling as a foggy aesthetic manifesto and rallying cry for fans—“brown” was for Ween. Early on in the duo’s fledgling career, brown meant making themselves happy, often at the expense of their audiences. During an opening slot for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a> in the late 1980s, ex-Ween tourmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6476-matt-sweeney/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Sweeney</a> remembered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Weens-Chocolate-Cheese-Hank-Shteamer/dp/0826431178"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a recent book</a><i>, </i>“they were pelted with change by newly bald straight-edge kids as Aaron sang the same <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6660-cat-stevens/"">Cat Stevens</a> song over and over.""</p>
<p>Flash-forward 30 years from the DIY spirit of Ween’s early recordings and performances, past the decade-plus when they packed amphitheaters, played late-night TV, got <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jordanaires"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elvis’ old backing group</a> to perform on an album with a song called “Piss Up a Rope”, and released a double-disc live album on <a href=""http://www.elektra.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elektra</a> called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintin'_the_Town_Brown:_Ween_Live_1990%E2%80%931998"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Paintin’ the Town Brown</i></a>. Now, there’s <i>FREEMAN</i>: on Aaron Freeman's self-titled solo album, the 44-year old singer finds himself on the other side of recovery, atoning for a life lived brown. “Covert Discretion” opens the album with a crushing level of vulnerability: “Another gig now, got an aching head, and I’m back on display,” he murmurs in a soft, folky voice that hasn’t deepened much since he was a teenager. “I’m your best friend, I’m your superstar/ Yeah, I’m down with the brown.” Despite it all, Ween could be a very reflective band, but “Discretion” is the first song sung by Aaron Freeman about the cost of living as Gene Ween.</p>
<p>“Discretion” is also<i> </i>the first public step of a drying-out process triggered by <a href=""http://www.straight.com/music/ween-completely-blows-it-bizarre-vancouver-show"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a sad January 2011 Ween show in Vancouver</a> that would lead to the band’s dissolution the following year. In front of 3,000 fans who paid $50 per ticket, Freeman laid down on the stage during songs and slurred his lyrics when he could remember them. The same behaviors that a 20-something Freeman would use to antagonize audiences, and with which he accumulated a fanbase of countless suburban stoners, had become blatant symptoms of a serious problem—what made Ween also killed it. As is his wont, however, there’s no easy emotional true north on <i>FREEMAN</i>. After gently pirouetting on a “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH2w6Oxx0kQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dust in the Wind</a>”-style guitar figure for a few minutes, “Discretion” suddenly shifts gears into a slick hesher anthem. “Fuck you all, I got a reason to live/ And I’m never gonna die,” he asserts, as the image of a New Age recovery facility gives way to a vision of a packed arena. Such balance of abject pathos and profane teenage-boy hardheadedness is a Ween trademark, which Freeman mastered on 1994’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0n6K3Nbmew&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Baby Bitch</a>,” a heartrending breakup song that had “Bitch” in the title and the line “Fuck you, you stinkin’-ass ho” gently inserted into the verse.</p>
<p>Indeed, part of what made Ween so great was Freeman and Melichiondo’s refusal to distinguish between sincerity and silliness, a mainstay of the druggy teenage boyhood that neither ever left. On “(For a While) I Couldn’t Play My Guitar Like a Man”, Freeman toys around with a bluesy lament, but it’s impossible to tell if he’s aiming toward a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossroads_(Eric_Clapton_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Crossroads</i></a>-style soul-selling or a 12-step-style soul search (or if, after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23143-eric-clapton/"">Clapton</a>, there is even a difference). Though “Black Bush” was inspired by the bucolic surround of the upstate New York region where the album was recorded, Freeman takes the opportunity to sing about the “crab man” and “woody-pecker” in his most cartoonishly mannered guru voice, even lapsing into Hindi on the chorus. <i>FREEMAN</i> is a thoroughly mellow—one might say anesthetized—recording, but throughout, Freeman’s gentle absurdity combines with the crack studio musicianship (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/"">Megafaun</a>’s Brad Cook and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1627-the-foreign-exchange/"">the Foreign Exchange</a>’s Chris Boerner contribute) to make an eerily soothing form of psychedelia bent on exploring the <i>other</i> side of getting fucked up.</p>
<p>Aaron Freeman’s search for brown has long faded, and what powers <i>FREEMAN </i>is his unique gift—audible since Ween sequenced the heartbreaking “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYTpU80KYpU&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Birthday Boy</a>” two tracks after “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caLj0ZBFUJA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Papa Zit</a>” on 1990’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8608-god-ween-satan-the-oneness/""><i>God Ween Satan</i></a>—in his inability to compartmentalize his emotions in his creative work.<i> </i>For three decades, he sacrificed his sobriety and nearly his life so that people like me could soundtrack stupors and sentimental moments in equal measure. As a teenager, I watched my skater friends huff Redi-Whip in an attempt to <i>really understand</i> “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuMvqejrHzg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Big Jilm</a>” (perhaps the band’s brownest song), and 12 years later, I watched two of my best friends dance to “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z1v_xtHpU8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stay Forever</a>” at their wedding reception. For Ween newcomers, <i>FREEMAN </i>is bound to sound odd, even off-putting. I get it. But this is the promise and labor of appreciating a lifelong cult artist like Freeman: taking the time to engage him on his own terms.</p></div>"|19506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19506-freeman-freeman/|6.5|Eric Harvey

Onstage, his whole body often balls up like a fist, and his eyes bug open like someone receiving shock therapy. His voice occupies some middle distance between a young <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15999-randy-newman/"">Randy Newman</a> and an older <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a>, yowling up into fluttery melismas and then settling into a barrel-chested belt. He's emotionally generous and theatrical, his musical ambitions too on the-sleeve to fit comfortably in the circumspect land of indie rock. Landlady move through their second record <i>Upright Behavior</i> like the USS Sincerity, offering to share with you in your biggest fears: death, loneliness, lack of purpose.<br/> <br/> Musically, they occupy a big middle space always in need of willing entrants: brainy, melodic pop-rock. Their arrangements, full of hard lefts and detours, pack paragraphs full of ideas into five minutes. Landlady songs are eventful, with chorales and middle eights opening up like big yellow umbrellas. On the fidgety, starched-collar ""Dying Day"", the hard downbeat repeatedly evaporates into a flutter of cartoon bluebirds. On ""Under the Yard"", the band stops playing so the members can sing a chorale based around the phrase ""Next to the tomato seeds is where I count my sheep,"" like an eccentric vocal warm-up exercise.</p>
<p>The band is an impressive battalion, and they move from mallet percussion to violin to keyboards with the nimbleness of a traveling theater troupe. The songs jump-cut from moment to moment, often landing in a different key or time signature out of the clear blue. The transitions sound clearly influenced by <i>Smile</i>, and sometimes, <i>Upright Behavior</i> feels like Schatz's attempt to make three <i>Smile</i>s at once. There are moments, here and there, where beleaguered listeners might wish for a few more full stops, fewer semicolons and embedded parentheticals.<br/> <br/> What saves Landlady's music from being swallowed by stagecraft is Schatz. He writes big hooks that hover like big neon signs over his bustling songs, and each one frames a glowing homily: ""We just want someone to turn on"" (from ""Girl"") or ""Where do I go when the blood won't go far enough to reach my heart?"" (""Under the Yard""). ""You and me, in the flood/ We survive,"" he sings, in a triumphantly up-swelling melody on ""Upright Behavior"", taking the phrase through it's melodic paces until he has plumbed every possible meaning out of them—wonder, disbelief, regret, defiance, gratitude. ""Please, allow me to believe in something bigger than my appetite,"" he pleads on ""Fine"". He comes across like Kevin Barnes, if Barnes were less arch and more concerned with cheering up your depressed great-aunt than with subversion. <i>Upright Behavior</i> is Schatz's attempt go pack as much of this essence into one space as possible, and it comes on like a combination Chinese finger trap and bear hug.</p></div>"|19561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19561-landlady-upright-behavior/|7.4|Jayson Greene

They’re lovely images and poignant remembrances, especially sung in Randell’s robustly ruminative voice and set to Steve Hassett’s gentle acoustic strums. As befits a duo that moved around the world to soft-start their career, the song dispels any romanticized notions of connection and memory: Everyone is a passerby in your life, and you’re merely a passerby in theirs.</p>
<p>And then Luluc ruin it. Randell ends the song with a blah couplet—“And as you go, know I love you so”—that brings the song to a rousing conclusion, completely undercutting the tough-minded verses. What begins as a world-wear reverie finishes as a Nicholas Sparks epilogue, as Luluc choose to state the obvious in the most obvious way possible. It’s not that those lines are wholly unnecessary, but that they carelessly cordon off the song’s emotions to deliver pat catharsis. Similarly, <i>Passerby</i> toggles awkwardly between the evocatively melancholy and the chintzily sentimental, rendering the carefully composed and performed music as little more than pretty.</p>
<p>This stumble will be all the more disappointing for anyone who heard the Brooklyn-via-Australia duo play on last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17799-way-to-blue-the-songs-of-nick-drake/"">Way to Blue: the Songs of Nick Drake</a></i>. It was an ill-conceived public tribute to a deeply private artist, yet Luluc’s versions of “Things Behind the Sun” and “Fly” were highlights that showcased both the dignified yearning of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Drake</a>’s lyrics and the easy chemistry between Randell and Hassett. They were something of an anomaly for those live performances, as at the time they had only one album, self-released back in 2008, to their name. On the strength of that tiny catalog and Randell’s big voice, Luluc signed to Sub Pop, where they join <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29611-the-head-and-the-heart/"">the Head &amp; the Heart</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30207-mirel-wagner/"">Mirel Wagner</a> on the folksier side of the roster.</p>
<p>Perhaps more crucially, Luluc gained the ear of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a>’s Aaron Dessner, who agreed to produce <i>Passerby</i> at his studio in Brooklyn's Ditmas Park area. His contributions are low-key and mostly unobtrusive. To reinforce the theme of departure and travel, he emphasizes the spry rhythmic guitar strums on opener “Small Window” and peppers “Early Night” with low-key industrial noise. Only “Tangled Heart” builds to anything that might be considered a big moment, with its texturing of horns greeting the Randell’s romantic regrets. Still, even Dessner can’t nudge Luluc out of their comfort zone: Every song trudges by at the same midtempo, conjuring the same atmosphere of glum reminiscence with no relief or variation.</p>
<p>As rich as Randell’s voice may be, this collection portrays her as a sharply limited artist, with only one mode and a few interpretive tricks up her sleeve. Occasionally she goes purposefully flat like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"">Nico</a>, other times she rounds her vowels luxuriantly, but there’s no tension, no conflict, no story to connect those moments into something larger. The result is a strictly passerby album: one that is heard and then quickly forgotten. </p></div>"|19505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19505-luluc-passerby/|4.9|Stephen Deusner

Granted, the film has aged poorly, and its weaknesses—<a href=""http://www.andpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/garden-state-wallpaper.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">obvious visual framing</a>, <a href=""http://www.lestroisdoigtsdelamain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tumblr_m3gzllY2Xk1rvo54fo1_500.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a reliance on juvenalia for comedic effect</a>, a bizarre focus on discouraging the use of antidepressants for the mentally ill—are present and plentiful. But <i>Garden State</i>’s appeal was and still is inherent to anyone who’s experienced or been able to recognize the emotional selfishness that comes with feeling adrift in your mid-to-late twenties. Even if the film failed to truly change viewers’ lives, at the least it convinced them of <a href=""http://mimg.ugo.com/201007/50284/cuts/2004-gardean-state-007_480x270.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the power of large-sized headphones</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>Garden State</i>’s legacy in the decade since it hit theatres isn't really about the film; it's become a pop culture totem, especially its Grammy-winning, platinum-selling soundtrack. Braff described it at the time as <a href=""http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/07/26/garden-state-soundtrack"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“a mix CD with all of the music that I felt was scoring my life”</a> while he worked on the film's screenplay, but few mix CDs <a href=""http://www.popscreen.com/v/7GA/SNL-Prom-Committee"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">have such an impact on the zeitgeist</a>. It's often and incorrectly cited as the first time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"">the Shins</a> were exposed to mainstream culture—you have <a href=""http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020221&amp;slug=shins21"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a different, more insidious corporate entity</a> to thank for that eventuality—but the <i>Garden State</i> soundtrack's tasteful folk-pop, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4733-zero-7/"">unassuming electronica</a>, and occasional <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJGSHMgbB0E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">old classic</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSlh8u8Nrig"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two</a> marks the point in the last decade when the term “indie” became more associated with how music sounds than the ethos behind how music’s made. Whether or not you’ve followed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2051-imogen-heap/"">Imogen Heap</a>’s solo career since, its existence is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTnzPuFPxPw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">partially owed</a> to <i>Garden State</i>; the set is responsible for much of the music you hear in Starbucks, as well as much of the music you can purchase at Starbucks.</p>
<p>A cultural event that arguably sowed the seeds for the musical conservatism infecting present-day mainstream rock, <i>Garden State</i> is mentioned with ire as much as it is with nostalgic fondness; in other words, it provokes strong feelings. So it’s understandable that, 10 years later and without much else since to lean on in terms of artistic credibility, Braff’s returned to the shallow well with <i>Wish I Was Here</i>, his second directorial effort. Frequently billed as <i>Garden State</i>’s <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=wish+i+was+here+spiritual+sequel&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=sb"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“spiritual sequel”</a> and sharing little with its predecessor beyond a strongly unlikable protagonist and the ever-present spectre of death, <i>Wish I Was Here</i> is a sometimes-bland, sometimes-intolerable mix of tired platitudes, overbearing religious themes, casual racism, and sappy sentimentality that, quality-wise, makes <i>Garden State</i> look like <i>The Graduate</i> by comparison.</p>
<p>Which is fine. Braff’s most vaunted position in pop culture circa 2014 isn’t as <a href=""http://www.tvposter.net/posters/scrubs_2001_562_poster.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the actor who played the annoying guy on the TV show your college roommates watched all the time</a>, or as <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/zachinoz"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a fervent Redditor</a> who <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCDzIEeZThQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">once assisted in helping someone propose to their girlfriend online</a>, or as <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20130311161057/http://storyful.com:80/stories/21372-zach-braff-and-mitt-romney-related-through-a-witch"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a distant blood relative to Mitt Romney</a>. Arguably, he’s not even most known as the guy who directed <i>Garden State</i>—he’s the guy who put together the <i>Garden State</i> soundtrack, and so the question surrounding <i>Wish I Was Here</i> is a strange one that most films aren’t subject to: What does it <i>sound</i> like? Braff himself is undoubtedly aware of this expectation, going as far <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1869987317/wish-i-was-here-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as to promise an early stream of the soundtrack to those who backed the film’s funding on Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>Such an incentive would have been unimaginably useless in <i>Garden State</i>’s case, as the film’s soundtrack was largely compiled of tunes that existed before its release; that’s not the case for <i>Wish I Was Here</i>, which features new songs written specifically for the film from the Shins, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>, and most curiously, a collaboration between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"">Cat Power</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>. With the exception of Bon Iver (whose “Holocene” is also featured here, almost to the point of self-parody), these acts were active concerns circa <i>Garden State</i>—for Coldplay and the Shins, it’s their second trip soundtracking Braff’s explicitly caucasian middle-class take on generational malaise—and their presence alone was practically preordained. The music on the <i>Garden State</i> soundtrack still sounds unmistakably like 2004, and <i>Wish I Was Here</i> follows suit; if we’re being charitable, the dated musical timeline it establishes plays like an alternate-universe pop cultural atmosphere that ground to a halt shortly after the release of Bon Iver’s 2009 EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12581-blood-bank-ep/""><i>Blood Bank</i></a>—a scenario where <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp7NtW_hKJI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coldplay never went EDM</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nl3Oo4-IQ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cat Power never worked with a French house duo</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofaRvNOV4SI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Justin Vernon never collaborated with Kanye West</a>, and (one can dream) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28316-broken-bells/"">Broken Bells</a> never happened.</p>
<p>Banjos, acoustic guitars, and unbearable expressions of earnestness abound; Paul Simon’s “The Obvious Child” is included, because of course it is. Gary Jules, an also-ran singer/songwriter whose <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3N1MlvVc4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">maudlin cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”</a> went viral after being featured in the closing moments of the 2001 sci-fi-cum-coming of age film <i>Donnie Darko</i> and more or less hasn’t been heard from since, shows up with the muddy, unlistenable “Broke Window”, taken from that year’s <i>Trading Snakeoil for Wolftickets</i>; elsewhere, alt-rock casualties Jump Little Children, who broke up nearly a decade ago, are featured with the impossibly plastic-sounding “Mexico”, a California-namechecking song that elevates <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq-S8CIU7VA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Phantom Planet</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15999-randy-newman/"">Randy Newman</a> status. Perhaps the strongest song featured on the soundtrack is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/279-badly-drawn-boy/"">Badly Drawn Boy</a>’s contemplative “The Shining”—taken from an album which first saw release nearly 15 years ago, cementing the soundtrack’s functionality as a nostalgia trip that registers on the level of seeing a Kerry/Edwards bumper sticker on a car windshield.</p>
<p>As for the new stuff: Bon Iver contribute “Heavenly Father”, a watery, over-processed slice of electro-folk that was perfected on the project’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/"">self-titled 2011 LP</a> and comes across as an unwanted leftover from those sessions. The film’s corresponding title track carries writing credits from Coldplay and features Cat Power’s Chan Marshall singing lead, and “Wish I Was Here”’s melodic structure certainly <i>sounds</i> like Coldplay, a subdued, unfussy version of the weirdest mega-band in the world’s skyscraping tendencies. But Marshall’s flat, unaffecting vocal take, along with the dull arrangement, makes for a boring ballad that outpaces anything on Coldplay’s recent misfire <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19344-coldplay-ghost-stories/""><i>Ghost Stories</i></a> in terms of tedium. In a sense, “Wish I Was Here” a perfect representation of the film and, by extension, Braff’s overall preferred aesthetic—moderately palatable, harmless, uninteresting, and ultimately less forgettable than you’d want it to be.</p>
<p>Fittingly, the sole new contribution that doesn’t scan as a failure comes from the Shins, a project that will probably never be able to escape the spectre of <i>Garden State</i> as long as there’s people out there who will marvel over the dirt in their fries. Shins bandleader James Mercer has, against all odds, spent the last decade quietly establishing himself as one of North America’s finest songwriters, turning out pretty-sounding songs that sound effortless in their simplicity, and “So Now What” is the latest example of him flexing his inimitable talent. It’s not the best Shins song, nor would any fan likely include it in a “Best of” compilation for the band, but it’s a better song than Braff’s film deserves, as Mercer’s voice gorgeously crests on a bed of reverb and synthetic strings.</p>
<p>The Shins’ last album from 2012, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16390-port-of-morrow/""><i>Port of Morrow</i></a>, found Mercer taking the cheesier sounds of rock music’s past and spinning gold out of them; the floaty textures of “So Now What”, on the other hand, sounds undeniably current, standing in opposition to the short-term retro malaise that <i>Wish I Was Here</i>’s soundtrack ultimately and greatly suffers from. Whether or not Braff was intending to capture a cultural moment with <i>Garden State</i>’s soundtrack, that’s exactly what he did; this time around, the moment eludes him, making his previous success as a musical tastemaker seem more than ever like a happy accident. Next time—if, God help us, Hollywood and the internet band together again and decide to give this guy <i>another</i> chance—he might be better off <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIqBke3zoM0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exploring the infinite abyss</a> for inspiration.</p></div>"|19625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19625-various-artists-wish-i-was-here-music-from-the-motion-picture/|2.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

This is an act which actually requires a great deal of resilience and self-belief; after all, this kind of music doesn’t find itself on the receiving end of a lot of outside validation in 2014. This circularity of struggling for struggle’s sake is even more pronounced in the title of <i>For Those Who Stay</i>; it can be read a show of confidence and gratitude to listeners who’ve stuck with this unfashionable, workmanlike band over the past eight years, as well as an acknowledgment that it’s hard to stick with an unfashionable, workmanlike band for eight years. At least there’s a level of comfort on both sides, though, and <i>For Those Who Stay</i> embodies the minor stakes and moderate goals of both performer and audience—it’s PS I Love You trying to be the biggest band for their little niche.</p>
<p>The title track is over six minutes long and about half of it is earmarked for a funk-grunge jam session; it arrives backed by a washed out remix courtesy of chillwave diehard <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28854-teen-daze"">Teen Daze</a>. “For Those Who Stay” is also the first single, so this is clearly not a band who’s going out of their way to expand their reach. PS I Love You might not have a legitimate crossover, go-for-broke, all-singles album in them, but if they did, it would probably sound like this.</p>
<p>Compared to the murky, macabre <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16584-ps-i-love-you-death-dreams/""><i>Death Dreams</i></a>, <i>For Those Who Stay</i> practically sparkles, as it was recorded in a “proper” studio and with a lot of what Saulnier calls “fancy gear”. Small indulgences creep in, as there’s often a third guy playing on any given song, contributing ARP string ensemble, piano, field recordings, Hammond B-3, stylophone, and other keyboards they proudly specify in the liner notes. The arrangements are incrementally more complex, though the stylistic range on <i>For Those Who Stay </i>is by far PS I Love You’s most expansive move yet<span>—</span>“In My Mind At Least” sneaks in mid-period Cure jangle before “Advice” lays back in the pocket with bloozy amble. “Bad Brain Day” and “Limestone Radio” show a surprising facility for both unencumbered acoustic balladry and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age"">QOTSA</a>-style riffs slapped together with a New Wave chorus.</p>
<p>They all sound like little nudges at PS I Love You’s set boundaries, since the duo are still an indie rock band first and foremost. You know this sound by now: fuzzed-out guitars that simultaneously handle rhythm and lead, steady, unshowy drums, and a general sense of hang-doggedness that could be heard as reflex, a sadness borne of realizing you’re drawn to a style of music that prefers a downer disposition. The first line on <i>For Those Who Stay</i> is, “I’m sorry I forgot about that thing I was supposed to do last week,” an offhand remark that somehow spells out an album’s entire emotional state of creeping guilt and regret.</p>
<p>Saulnier’s voice somehow makes that line sound like an apology worthy of a cataclysmic, life-altering failure, as his adenoidal squawk (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer"">Dan Bejar</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16596-alec-ounsworth"">Alec Ounsworth</a>) the one thing that most distinguishes PS I Love You from their fuzz-duo peers. On the other hand, it’s the one thing that could trigger the kind of allergic reaction unattributable to their fuzz-duo peers who lack such idiosyncrasies good or bad.</p>
<p>But this divisiveness has already been established; <i>For Those Who Stay</i> won’t change your opinion either way, and at the most, it might make you feel more strongly about what you already believe. In turn, that seems to calcify opinion into hard truth—that PS I Love You are a band that’s pretty great at being pretty good, while lacking the sort of risk and extroversion that can trigger real passion. The songs are catchy but they don’t quite feel anthemic; they’re loud and distorted, but they probably couldn’t start a mosh pit. Yes, it’s a shame that<i> another</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids"">Canadian duo</a> that got started around the same time does this kind of thing on a much, much higher level, but you stack a line like “We’re never gonna win/ Keep tryin’ is all you can do” or the shrugged resignment of “Hoarders” and “Friends Forever” against their Vancouver peers’ raw lust for living, and PS I Love You's modest place in the grand scheme of things just feels like an accurate reflection of their ambitions.</p>
<p>And really, the one thing that probably determines your excitement and enjoyment of <i>For Those Who Stay</i> is just how much you’ve invested in PS I Love You being one of your favorite bands. You get t<span id=""docs-internal-guid-cebe7f86-21e4-83dc-51cf-a9e35b6ad21b""><span>he weird sense that <i>For Those Who Stay</i> is at its best when you’re its captive audience </span></span>and as Saulnier belts out a line like, “How much did it hurt to make it this far?/ I still believe in you all,"" you can at least root for PS I Love You, even if you don’t love them.</p></div>"|19580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19580-ps-i-love-you-for-those-who-stay/|6.3|Ian Cohen

Originally a hit for Frankie Laine in 1951, it’s been covered often in various languages and genres, although most versions gently reinforce the song’s matter-of-fact pop sexism. Borrowing from Edith Piaf’s cover (“c’était toi!”), Calvi turns the song into a flamenco rock aria, her voice soaring accusatorily and her guitar providing sinister commentary. With its emotions blown up to operatic scale, “Jezebel” plays less like a woman-baiting lament and more like a powerful fanfare. Calvi may sing in second person, but she embraces the role of Jezebel as one of immense power. </p>
<p>That single introduced Calvi as a song interpreter with unique vocal power and timbre as well as versatile guitar chops, but her first two albums—2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15153-anna-calvi/"">Anna Calvi</a></i> and last year’s weirdly under-the-radar <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18601-anna-calvi-one-breath/"">One Breath</a></i>—settled into a more workaday singer-songwriter mode. For that reason, a covers EP sounds like a natural and promising endeavor, one that lets her concentrate exclusively on crafting nuanced performances. She could easily level a small city with her voice, but instead chooses to emphasize subtlety and incremental shades of mood on these five songs. “Papi Pacify” becomes a slow blues seduction, not too far from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16034-twigs-papi-pacify/"">original</a> in tone and setting, but Calvi draws out the ""ooh""’s leading up to the chorus and settles into the languorous guitar chords afterwards. The song takes on a pattern of tension and release that sounds slyly sexual.</p>
<p>Subtlety and restraint are, refreshingly, crucial to <i>Strange Weather. </i>She dials her vocals back considerably for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/219-keren-ann/"">Keren Ann</a>’s “Strange Weather”, a duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"">David Byrne</a>, which sounds like a quiet moment after some great cataclysm. Even the climax of “I’m the Man, That Will Find You” plays things close to the chest, as Calvi relegates the dramatic wailing to the background in order to make her measured lead more prominent. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29861-connan-mockasin/"">Connan Mockasin</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16080-im-the-man-that-will-find-you/"">original</a> still sounds like a put-on—a half-joke built on aspic-wobbly vocals and a winking slink of a groove—yet Calvi takes the lyrics at face value and rescues the song from such fatal irony. Even so, its power lays not so much in her vocals but in her guitar playing, as she draws out that central riff like it’s an old delta blues lick.</p>
<p>None of these covers is quite as transformed as “Jezebel”, so nothing on <i>Strange Weather</i> delivers the same subversive charge. Partly that’s due to her choice in material, which for the most part is recent and more indie-oriented. So it’s odd that the two oldest tunes on here fare the worst. Her version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>’s “Ghost Rider” may play a bit with gender roles, but it’s so beholden to the original that it comes across as post-apocalyptic karaoke, more tedious than thrilling. And closer “Lady Grinning Soul” foregoes the cosmic pomp and self-regard of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">Bowie</a>’s early ‘70s original for an easy elegiac tone that allows <i>Strange Weather </i>to simply dissipate into the ether. Her restraint is commendable, but on these two songs it curdles into something like hesitation. </p></div>"|19504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19504-anna-calvi-strange-weather-ep/|6.3|Stephen Deusner

Whether it’s due to a lack of differentiating reference points (every young guitarist, mind you, recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"">John Fahey</a>) or the isolating nature of the enterprise itself, emerging guitarists often seem conscripted into that role forever. Fahey rarely gets mentioned for his fascinating <i>musiqué concrete </i>experiments, or Sandy Bull for his work with electronics and exotica. Is it any wonder that <i>Rainy Day Raga</i>—the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4967-peter-walker"">Peter Walker</a> album <i>without</i> flute, violin, and sarod—remains the only one listeners really know?<i> </i>As a sideman for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2417-lambchop/"">Lambchop</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3786-silver-jews/?"">Silver Jews</a> and the head of an excellent reissue label, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29384-william-tyler/"">William Tyler</a> has had a career as varied as his albums, which have moved increasingly at liberty between lithe electrics, plaintive acoustics, and beguiling electronics. His latest EP is a <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mergerecords/william-tyler-whole-new-dude"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">three-song rock stomp</a>, but the handle of “acoustic guitarist,” the heritage of his earliest works, will likely remain his yoke for years to come.</p>
<p>During the last five years, the British guitarist James Blackshaw has attempted to move beyond the restrictive reputation he gained during the first half of his career. On his early albums for Tompkins Square and Young God, Blackshaw blossomed from a majestic player into a stunning arranger, able to link his 12-string fantasies with backlit accompaniment that, though spare, doubled the guitar’s emotional payload. And on more recent works, he’s increased his time on the piano and the nylon-stringed guitar. He wrote exclusively for those instruments on<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16527-love-is-the-plan-the-plan-is-death/"" target=""_blank""> <i>Love is The Plan, The Plan is Death</i></a> from 2012, an album that even included an oblong torch song with saturnine vocals from heavy metal singer <a href=""http://menaceruine.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Geneviève Beaulieu</a>. Last year, he issued <i>The Watchers</i>, a beautiful collection of improvisations with Lubomyr Melnyk, the Ukrainian pianist who shares with Blackshaw <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/9291-the-out-door-2013/4/"" target=""_blank"">a love of ornate, uninterrupted audio.</a> Blackshaw’s new music is the sound of someone actively pressing against the boundaries of expectation.</p>
<p><i>Fantômas: Le Faux Magistrat</i> is Blackshaw’s most audacious attempt yet to shatter that mold. Recorded live in Paris last Halloween, the seamless 74-minute piece stemmed from a commission for a live score for the <a href=""http://www.fantomas-lives.com/fanto4e.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1914 silent movie <i>Le Faux Magistrat</i></a>. The fifth film in a series of classics by Louis Feuillade, <i>Le Faux Magistrat</i> ended a centennial celebration of the director at the prestigious <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_du_Ch%C3%A2telet"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Théâtre de Châtelet</a>. Preceded by the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24435-yann-tiersen/"">Yann Tiersen</a>, Blackshaw was tasked with providing accompaniment to the screening. Rather than write a long and loping guitar piece, though, Blackshaw took it as an invitation to exercise his unrest. He recruited a quartet to work through a set of a dozen interconnected movements, surprisingly filled with dissonant electronics and consonant strings, dynamic percussion and versatile saxophone. Blackshaw leads with piano, nylon-stringed guitar and an electric, but he often yields the foreground to the group, slipping into the mix like a composer watching from the wings as an ensemble goes to work.</p>
<p>And the players he assembled are a stunning mix, capable of animating his search for inspiration in soft jazz and classical minimalism, electroacoustic luminescence and sweeping post-rock, without pause. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/7825-the-out-door-5/3/"" target=""_blank"">Duane Pitre</a> and <a href=""http://www.charlotteglasson.com/charlotteglasson.com/Bio.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Glasson</a>—American and British experimental multi-instrumentalists, respectively—serve as the utility players here, accenting the music’s range. Pitre moves between electric guitar harmonics and subdural drones, while Glasson adds bold saxophone and sweeping strings, sometimes within the span of a single minute. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Scott_(drummer)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Slowdive’s Simon Scott</a> shifts between light, almost incidental percussion and thundering drums. Indeed, their most powerful moment as a group comes at one of Blackshaw’s most surprising turns as a composer. While he plays what could pass for a sample of “A Love Supreme” on piano, Scott and Pitre, now on bass and synthesizer, form a punishing, doom-like rhythm section. Glasson laces the load with vibraphone whorls and saxophone sighs. She is the bait, balanced at the lip of the trap.</p>
<p>The condition that gives moments like this their intrigue—that is, Blackshaw is actively working to outstrip his past—is also the source of <i>Fantômas’</i> overall error. Blackshaw and his band return to a handful of themes and textures, such as the piano ostinato that serves as a bridge between several pieces. But it all seems a touch desultory, too, as though Blackshaw’s suddenly large toolkit tempted him to build too much too soon. Parts evolve with force, not finesse, and many moments seem undeserved and undeveloped, as when electronic washes empty into the mix like a transitional crutch.</p>
<p>In the past, Blackshaw’s music seemed to reveal cathedrals of wonder and mystery, a quality that made it worth revisiting. But much of <i>Fantômas </i>seems plain and pat, the sort of structures one might make while learning the basics of a trade. Many of the piano lines here mirror Blackshaw’s guitar work, but they’re less powerful and wooing in their new, almost hesitant voice. And at worst, the nylon-string bits can feel like outright pap, cheap filler in a broad and ornate scheme. During the piece’s grand moment of high-rising action, for instance, Blackshaw takes what sounds <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK-NcRmVcw&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like Europe’s “The Final Countdown”</a> for a lap of soft-rock shuffle. Intentional or not, it’s a hilarious distraction from the music’s pensive mood, a break in the reverie that feels every bit like a growing pain.</p>
<p><i>Fantômas </i>is certainly a pleasant listen, perhaps a bit jumbled for any immersion but varied and arching enough to soundtrack household chores. Still, its most notable accomplishment is that it should emancipate Blackshaw, once and for all, from his 12-string-guitarist cloister, or from the prevailing if obsolete notion that he does only one thing. Ideas abound during <i>Fantômas</i>, even if the execution is lacking. That’s a happy reversal from Blackshaw’s previously pristine output—an auspicious sign for the future, even if necessitates a rather forgettable present.     </p></div>"|19543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19543-james-blackshaw-fantomas-le-faux-magistrat/|6.6|Grayson Haver Currin

Previously propelled by the slow chug of their peers, the Delta sludge wave now meanders into turbid waters with the release of <i>Constricting Rage of the Merciless</i>, the latest full-length from Goatwhore and the follow-up to 2012's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16319-blood-for-the-master/"" target=""_blank"">Blood for the Master</a></i>. For over fifteen years now, the quartet has been merging black metal, thrash, and the blues into a direct, southern-fried take on the genre. The Louisianans’ structural scope may be limited <span class=""s1"">to brief barn burners,</span>  but they have largely managed to avoid stoner metal's ubiquitous bloat, which makes the band’s limited structural scope easier to overlook. Goatwhore remain more or less unchanged, powered by their faithful, fast rhythmic undertow and frequent soloing. Still, even the most reliable paradigms can feel stale once in a while, though, and so <i>Constricting Rage</i> ends up being the outfit’s most varied record to date, as well as their strongest.</p>
<p class=""p1"">At first, the prospect of a more textured version of Goatwhore's sound comes across as an unappealing notion, as the band’s punkish qualities instantly distinguish them from their molasses-tempoed contemporaries (and let’s be honest, with Crowbar and company back on the scene, is there really a need for more dirge-y bands in Louisiana?). Nevertheless, ""Cold Earth Consumed in Dying Flesh” showcases the band’s slower side with aplomb, importing Scandinavian touches like ominous synths and brittle blast-beats to complement all that whiskey-fueled thrash. That's as far as the album goes insofar as tectonic shifts; elsewhere, the New Orleans crew embellish their current sonics with meatier guitars, stronger melodic leads, and, perplexingly, a lack of bass throughout the entire album. Fortunately, Louis Ben Falgoust’s profane yowls have never sounded more commanding, and his range of growls and screams lend a terrific contrast to the dull roar of his bandmates.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">In Goatwhore’s wicked universe, sexuality and the supernatural always go hand-in-hand—an unsurprising paradigm, considering that the quartet hail from one of North America's most haunted cities. The lecherous hydra that graces <i>Constricting Rage</i>’s cover is an emblem for the album’s broader lyrical themes, none of which are new: screwing, Satan, sacrifice. As with most black metal bands, Goatwhore aren’t afraid to pepper their anthems with shock value, constructing vivid scenes of demonic sex on “FBS”—or, to pick apart the acronym in a family-friendly manner, “Snuggling with Satan”. With understated eloquence, the band weaves together mystical images of entwined bodies in the form of snakes, giving way to the dissolution of man’s mortal coil. Even with its carnal, corny chant of “Fucked by Satan,” the song’s poetics shine through; thanks to the spread-out mixing, Falgoust’s gurgled poetry can actually be heard above his partners’ racket, though his reptilian death growls on “Poisonous Existence in Reawakening"" will have many listeners scrambling for the liner notes. At any rate, it’s great to hear the band sharpening this dimension of their sound, especially considering that incessant, largely unwavering gallop of the guitars start to grow wearisome around the album’s halfway point.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Ultimately, <i>Constricting Rage</i> will either prove redundant or ravishing.

It was always in the style's DNA: dubstep forebears and 2-step monkey-patched glossy house tunes, with the type of ornate syncopations that Timbaland improbably turned into chart-topping pop. Somewhat inevitably, the interest in the productions fostered interest in the vocalists. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22489-zomby/"">Zomby</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"">Aaliyah</a>-jacking ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FriS8EVVJg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Float</a>"", from 2008, is one of the earlier examples, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29665-jacques-greene/"">Jacques Greene</a>'s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12191-another-girl/"">Another Girl</a>"" seemed to put a point on the vogue in early 2011.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Hyperdub, intentionally or not, has served as one incubator of this style in its admirable quest to foster urban club music. <i>Hyperdub 10.2</i> represents the second of four compilations documenting the label's first decade (but largely displaying its most recent five years). Focusing on the label's self-professed R&amp;B offerings (the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19356-hyperdub-101/"">first volume</a> having showcased the label's club music), <i>10.2</i> mixes new offerings from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22051-kode9/"">Kode9</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30522-cooly-g/"">Cooly G</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31482-jessy-lanza/"">Jessy Lanza</a> with older tracks from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"">DJ Rashad</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17191-terror-danjah/"">Terror Danjah</a>. A mixed bag, stylistically, <i>10.2</i>'s tracks are bound by rustling vocals, lights-low tempos, and sultry arrangements.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Having grown fond of sampling vocals from R&amp;B divas, the UK underground took the next logical step and began singing themselves. Acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29414-katy-b/"">Katy B</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30260-alunageorge/"">AlunaGeorge</a> represent a generation for whom Aaliyah and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/225-amerie/"">Amerie</a> typify pop normalcy, a generation who watched the avant-garde crystalize into the mainstream. So there are large swaths of <i>10.2</i> that, in 2014 (or, frankly, 2004), scan as fairly catholic takes on minimal, electro R&amp;B.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is where the material falters, at once hewing too closely to R&amp;B's sonic template while pulling its emotional punches. Cooly G's ""Obsessed"" details an infatuation but censors itself: ""Looking at me/ Watching me/ Wanna f--- me"". Jessy Lanza's ""5785021"" turns a phone number into a chorus, tightroping the line between coy and corny. On tracks such as Terror Danjah's ""You Make Me Feel"" and Morgan Zarate's ""Pusher Taker"", the vocal performances struggle to keep pace with the tricky, intriguing productions. Too often, dubby reflections and breathy whispering are substituted for more traditional melisma and inflection; the effect isn't seduction, but apprehension.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>10.2</i> fares better when it engages R&amp;B on more ephemeral terms. Burial's inky transmissions dissolve the late-night, call-in loneliness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/underscore/8822-quiet-storm-tk-tk-tk/"">Quiet Storm</a> R&amp;B. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32295-copeland/"">Inga Copeland</a> tracks that bookend the album—first with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30837-dean-blunt/"">Dean Blunt</a> and then Kode9—are intoxicating, her flatlining, anti-diva voice bristling against seasick arrangements, the finest marriage of the label's avant-garde instincts with pop forms. DJ Rashad's ""Only One"" skirts the R&amp;B conversation entirely: it's the rare footwork track that trades freneticism for tenderness. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30059-dva/"">DVA</a>'s ""Just Vybe"" features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31779-fatima/"">Fatima</a>, the best, most idiosyncratic singer on <i>10.2</i>; she offers up a tart melody that feels like a proper UK take on welterweight R&amp;B. Its charm exposes how labored and earnest much of <i>10.2</i> is.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Electronic music's interest in R&amp;B mirrors a more general trend in underground music, one that has recently extended further into the past, touching most recently on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_%26_Lewis"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jam &amp; Lewis</a>' glassy funk (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/"">Kelela</a>'s <i>Cut 4 Me</i> mixtape being the most prominent example). But it's safe to say that, as yet, the songwriting and vocal components of the genre have failed to inspire the same unbridled creativity as the productions. Hyperdub's relationship to the form is less developed and less guided than their stewardship of footwork or UK club music, and it leaves <i>10.2</i> in the lurch, lacking clear purpose. At times it feels like dabbling, on the part of both the label and the artists (see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"">Ghostface</a>'s bolted-on guest appearance on Morgan Zarate's ""Sticks &amp; Stones""). There's enough flair on <i>10.2</i> to justify further exploration, but it's premature to label this ""future R&amp;B"" when its participants seem so uneasy with the genre's past.</p></div>"|19639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19639-various-artists-hyperdub-102/|6.7|Andrew Gaerig

(If anything, Alvvays’ dual affinities for post-<i>C86</i> girl-group revisionism and dusty-grooved distortion strongly suggest they’re yearning for a time when seeking out bands involved trans-Atlantic fanzine correspondence and mail-order forms.) Apparently, the curious spelling was implemented to avoid confusion with <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/thames-valley-leather-club-and-other-stories-mw0000104648"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the bygone, like-minded British indie-pop outfit with the same name</a>. However, Alvvays actually proves to be a perfect visual manifestation of this band’s thematic framework: with nearly every crestfallen song on their debut pitched at the crossroads of commitment and abandonment, nostalgia and uncertainty, the band’s name effectively becomes the textual representation of the broken promises catalogued within.</p>
<p>Such quarterlife-crisis concerns—the bane a generation that, as one song puts it, feels like it’s “too late to go out, too young to stay in”—are natural preoccupations for a band of twentysomethings that is the very product of upheaval and a clean-slate reset. As recently as two years ago, Nova Scotia native Molly Rankin was still trying to establish her identity as a solo artist on the maritime club circuit—a task made all the more formidable by the fact she’s a descendent of Canadian roots-music dynasty <a href=""http://www.therankinfamily.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Rankin Family</a>. An <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-lVT3rGk4k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">EP released under her own name in 2010</a> suggested she was destined to travel down a similarly bucolic path, casting her cheekily self-deprecating lyrics and siren of a voice in familiarly folksy surroundings. However, her partnership with that record’s guitarist Alec O’Hanley (formerly of Prince Edward Island power-popsters Two Hours Traffic) would eventually turn more ambitious. With Rankin enlisting childhood friend Kerri MacLellan on keyboards and O’Hanley recruiting PEI pals Brian Murphy and Phil MacIssac on bass and drums, the quintet relocated to Toronto last year with their new name, new aesthetic, and, in former brunette Rankin’s case, new hair.</p>
<p>But it's not just the singer’s striking, peroxide-blond locks that make Alvvays stick out from the infinite number of contemporary indie acts forging a similar union between early-’60s AM-radio pop and late-’80s freak-scene discord. On the band’s winsome Chad VanGaalen-produced debut, it’s the disarmingly frank, aching lyricism that ultimately raises them above the cardiganed fray, capturing both the humour and heartache of seeking intimacy in the big city. Amid the buoyant surf-tingled jangle of the opening “Adult Diversion,” Rankin isn’t just discreetly ogling a fellow commuter from afar; she’s already plotting out their future domestic bliss, asking her oblivious object of desire, “How do I grow old with you even if you don’t notice as I pass by you on the subway?” The rousing, pints-aloft follow-up, “Archie, Marry Me”, serves as a sequel of sorts where Rankin has got the guy, but not the ring—and yet she already sounds less like she’s fighting for the love of her life than checking items off a list (“Honey, take me by the hand, and we can sign some papers/ Forget the invitations, floral arrangements, and breadmakers”), thereby proving that the only thing more tragic than a break-up song is one about a person desperate to break <i>in</i>.</p>
<p>Rankin possesses the sort of radiant but deceptively deadpan voice that lets her to infuse these lovelorn laments with sly, sometimes sinister wit: when she sings, “I left my love in the river” on the drowned-boyfriend requiem “Next of Kin”, there’s the simmering implication that she could’ve done a little more to save him. (The chorus to the dreamy slow-motorik ballad “Ones Who Love You,” meanwhile, is home to the most beautifully nonchalant f-bomb.) This sense of irreverence bleeds into the album’s production, whose scabrous guitar lines, synth-blurred vistas, and drum-machine experiments reveal the band are hardly the purists their pedigree might indicate. Presenting a brighter contrast to the claustrophobic insularity heard on VanGaalen's own recordings and in his work with the much-missed Women, <i>Alvvays</i> eagerly scuffs up the band’s gold sounds with dissonant edges—not to deliberately obscure the gleaming melodies or make the band seem tougher than they are, but to enhance the very feeling of raw-nerved unrest seeping through Rankin’s lyric sheet. This is the sound of pristine pop music blasted through cheap, blown-out headphones—and every time it seems like a song is about to decay before your ears, you sense both the sadness and liberation of knowing that nothing lasts forever.</p></div>"|19508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19508-alvvays-alvvays/|7.6|Stuart Berman

The successes of <i>Never Hungover Again</i> are numerous, and the foremost is how Joyce Manor's most ambitious and diverse album is just like their other ones<span>—</span>10 songs, 19 minutes, every second as weird as it is instantly enjoyable.</span></p>
<p>Assuming you’re approaching this record as a self-identifying “indie rock” fan, there isn’t a single “legitimate” precedent that will walk you through this—maybe “west coast <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2477-lifetime"">Lifetime</a>” comes close, considering Barry Johnson’s perpetual slur, self-deprecation, and goofy earnestness. Joyce Manor are a stylistically comprehensive band and this record is a consolidation of their talents, accomplishing the difficult task of welding the straightforward charms of their increasingly canonical self-titled debut and the ambition of <i>Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired</i>, a record praised at the time for its relatively experimental leanings and in retrospect for having the fortune of being produced by “the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18060-deafheaven-sunbather""><i>Sunbather</i></a> guy” (even though numerous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a> songs are longer than the complete running time of <i>Of All Things</i>).</p>
<p><i>Of All Things</i>’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejHg91YzUMg&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Bride of Usher”</a> was typical of that record’s dilettantism, Joyce Manor playing a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths"">Smiths</a> song by cribbing Johnny Marr’s leads and their rhythm section’s bounce; it felt as much of a cover as their actual take on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W4CXnBnM8w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Buggles</a>. The remarkable “Falling In Love Again” reverses and imagines if the Smiths wrote a Joyce Manor song<span>—</span>Tony Hoffer (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck"">Beck</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83"">M83</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air"">Air</a>) adds a glycerine sheen to the slashing guitar chords and maxes Johnson’s vocals to a state of high school high drama; you can believe the title is being played straight or you can hear lines of Moz-like ambivalence (“Hope you don’t think that I care/ ‘Cause I do I just don’t know if I should feel this bad about you”) as being par for Joyce Manor: falling in love again is just the first step to the preferred resting state of falling out.</p>
<p>This is how Joyce Manor operates: in the past, beach communities, toothaches and model train sets were merely symbols and mirrors for Johnson’s infinite sadness.  So while “End of the Summer”, “Heated Swimming Pool”, and “Heart Tattoo” are indicative of Joyce Manor’s suburban purview and are about the exact things they promise, Johnson’s subtle and powerful insight allows him to expose new angles and multitudes in the mundane. “The Jerk” is, yes, about being a jerk and also watching the titular movie and learning “that stuff don't work."" In both “Christmas Card” and “Heart Tattoo”, love can only be legitimized by pain<span>—</span>“I want it to hurt really bad/ That’s how I’ll know it’s real.” Johnson’s lyrics are conversational, kegside and half-pipe ruminations taking on a heft and layered meaning that likely escapes everyone involved until they’ve had a chance to mull them over alone: “Never really had a drug phase/ So you think you’re fucking miserable now?”, “I always knew you'd join the army,”  “I wish you would’ve died in high school/ So you could be somebody’s idol.”</p>
<p>But if you want to hear <i>Never Hungover Again</i> as a summer record, Joyce Manor mask their depressive streak with chiming, fake 12-string riffs, midtempo jangle, group harmonies, and basically everything that can be crammed into pop-punk without turning it into plain ol’ “indie rock”. Most bands working on a two-minute time limit tend to strip things down to the most rudimentary aspects and Joyce Manor can do that—the strict tense verse/explosive chorus template of “Victoria” is proof enough, though it’s an outlier that reflects how unconventional the band’s songwriting is throughout. The velocity of<i> Never Hungover Again</i> has an illusory effect where you can hear these songs as having been isolated from lengthier ones<span>—</span> the strange riff that bisects “Schley” sounds like it was excised from a long-winded solo, “Catalina Fight Song” is a 64-second perpetual crescendo that’s missing the expected, vestigial four-minute run-up, and “Falling in Love Again” churns tempestuously through near shoegaze synth ambience without ever hitting a predictable peak.<br/><br/><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Upon first listen, the brevity of </span><i>Never Hungover Again</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> can sound less effective than, say, trying to hammer to home a chorus for the third time</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">.</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> But once you stop trying to label what </span><i>should</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> be a hook and focus on what </span><i>is</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, the ingenuity of each song’s design and the ear-turning nature of every maneuver speaks to </span><i>Never Hungover Again</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">'s inexhaustible quality, the kind of album you can play three times in a row without any part wearing out its welcome.</span></p>
<p>Yet, the broad appeal of this record somehow makes it a more precarious sell than something that can be easily pegged; pop-punk literalists may reflexively hear the slick production as a betrayal and compliments such as “smart” or “crafty” as backhanded against its visceral, pleasure-seeking genre, similar to “conscious rap” or “intelligent dance music”. Meanwhile, it may be seen by indie fans as less substantial than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31732-perfect-pussy/"">Perfect Pussy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32333-united-nations"">United Nations</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30542-white-lung"">White Lung</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings"">Cloud Nothings</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31939-the-hotelier"">the Hotelier,</a> who have revitalized their modes of punk in 2014 with <i>heavy</i> albums that nobody would call “fun”. <span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> Joyce Manor make punk music for the other 99% of waking life when you're not functioning at peak intensity</span>—</span>for getting drunk, being bored, falling in love, feeling like shit, and wondering if your best days are behind you before heading out to a pool party you're pretty stoked about. The optimal balance of maturity and immaturity is right there in the title, so throw on <i>Never Hungover Again</i> when you’re still looking to get into dumb shit, but you just want to be smarter about it.</p></div>"|19507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19507-joyce-manor-never-hungover-again/|7.8|Ian Cohen

It's a big, sticky noun, clinical, embarrassing to say, let alone sing. But he works it into the penultimate song on <i>The Cover of Hunter</i>, ""Made From Tin"", naming the illness the ""guts and gore"" of an allegorical body that's also tethered by anxiety and whipped by insecurity. The song, one of the record's fastest, fills the space between its shaky guitar strokes with patient breaths of clarinet. At the chorus, Betson borrows the vocal lilt Conor Oberst used on the Bright Eyes deep cut ""Amy in the White Coat"". ""For you, the world is poorly lit,"" he sings, ""so by nightfall, you're used to it.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Not every lyricist is agile enough to be this blunt. Furious and mournful in turn, <i>The Cover of Hunter</i> navigates a hot, blurry headspace, the kind of slow-burning panic that corners you into the back of your own skull. Betson barely keeps the quiver in his voice under control as he wrings out his catalog of thick and heady lyrics. A former guitarist for Titus Andronicus (Patrick Stickles guests here on ""X""), he's inherited that band's feel for dynamics. Songs glide, then crumple. The eight-minute opener ""I Can't Tell If You're Looking At Me"" kicks from a mellow strum into a bout of inflamed rock, all the while standing on just a handful of chords. Betson's careful with the notes he lets into his space. He'd rather see how far a simple progression can stretch than try to expand upon it. He begins <i>Hunter</i> with the same gall it took for Built to Spill to start off <i>You In Reverse </i>with ""Goin' Against Your Mind"", a nine-minute song made of just two chords.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""Cop Car"" is another sprawler, one with so much space under its roof that it starts to breed its own ecosystem. Betson's unsure voice calculates its internal logic; he watches his feelings shift in color from lavender to blue, watches his love transform from beautiful to pure. I don't know why purity excludes beauty, but in his voice I can feel the tension between the two. I can feel how sad it is that the last hints of red have dripped from him.</p>
<p class=""p1"">At times, Betson's words bunch up on him. On the tight and fiery ""Pocket Knife"", he moves from imagining himself as an idol, a doll, and a decaying concrete slab to just imagining ""what's possible""—then he repeats ""what's possible"" so many times its meaning starts to drain. Later, he saturates ""The Primordial Will"" with the phrase ""sobbing in my bed"" until the words become architectural, a haven, both comforting and claustrophobic. Betson drags the same pleasure out of language that you get from a riff looping around itself.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As rich in words as it is, <i>The Cover of Hunter</i> can grow dense to the point of alienation. Some clusters, like the one at the end of the third person flash fiction ""X"", don't quite make it out of the universe where they're conceived. Two film samples on the opener and closer also crack the album's fever. It doesn't help that the first sample is the same one that How to Dress Well used on <i>Total Loss</i>, a clip from the film <i>Streetwise</i> that forges an unnecessary portal between the two records. But that's a minor distraction. Betson strings his nerves taut here, straining for the better part of an hour not to fray. Words tumble out of him like he's trying to talk away the ennui, trying to get something, anything, to stick to someone besides himself. <i>The Cover of Hunter</i> keeps busy in order to smother its loneliness. It's the kind of desperation worth reveling in.</p></div>"|19609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19609-liam-betson-the-cover-of-hunter/|7.3|Sasha Geffen

Tot. He’s kept awfully busy in the years following the project’s 2008 inception, releasing or appearing on a total of 17 albums, EPs, and compilations (most notably on split releases with Deathstench and Sutekh Hexen). His latest work, <i>Perfection &amp; Permanence</i>, was recently released by UK institution Cold Spring, and marks his most strangely listenable output yet.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Trepaneringsritualen christens itself “Götisk Dödsindustri”, or ""death industrial"", and the project delivers on thats promise by saturating Ekelund’s scrapings with gloomy, gothic atmospheres and a heavy ritual ambient influence. The songs are molded upon burly loops that shudder and sway beneath Ekelund’s perpetually mutating vocals. Laden with distortion and effects, hints of melody pulse ominously beneath the heavy synth lines and bludgeoning rhythmic core. It’s disturbing and appealing in equal measure, and its droning characteristics lend an almost psychedelic quality to some of the longer, more convoluted passages that litter tracks like the murky “Liken Ingen Jord Vill Svälja”. <br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“Venerated &amp; Despised” opens the album carefully, lulling the listener into a false sense of security before revealing the true horrors it holds. There’s no lack of aggression on tracks like the menacing “Alone/A/Cross/Abyss” or the genuinely frightening “Castrate Christ”, which finds Ekelund’s vocals devolving into a nasty reptilian croak buried under noxious waves of distortion and reverb. Minimalist interlude “39 Lashes” offers a brief respite before the hoarse, repetitive abrasion of “The Seventh Man” kicks in. Even the relatively restrained “A Black Egg” seeks to unnerve with its skittering percussion, hovering, ghostly loops, and Ekelund’s strident spoken meditations on spectres in black and depravity.  The songs are quite short, only surpassing the five minute mark on the ultra-distorted closing hellscape of “He Who Is My Mirror.”</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Unlike so many projects that labor beneath the wide banner of power electronics, Trepaneringsritualen overlooks humanity’s sickness and instead concerns itself with matters of magick, religion, and the occult. The ritualistic feel to much of Ekelund’s output is no accident, and <i>Perfection &amp; Permanence</i> delves bone-deep into the dark recesses that fuel his need to create. Bleak, apocalyptic dirges and mechanical menace abound. The most insidious aspect to this album lies within its accessibility and crossover appeal. As much as this project owes to noise and ambient music, there are similarities to the most extreme metal as well, especially in aesthetics and intent. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Trepaneringsritualen often plays gigs in and around its native Sweden with occult-minded black metal bands like One Tail, One Head, and even appeared at this past year’s Inferno Metal Festival in Norway alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5895-watain/"" target=""_blank"">Watain</a>, Blasphemy, and Mgła. He performs covered in animal blood, wild-eyed and violent; his long hair and beard stream with offal, and his brutally confrontational approach leaves audience members reeling. Ekelund’s sworn allegiance to distortion, decaying atmosphere, and all-around depravity mirrors a good deal of what many of black metal’s best new bands are doing. The two genres have long enjoyed a cozy relationship, and while Dominick Fernow’s now-defunct Hospital Productions enclave was perhaps the most obvious manifestation of the ties between raw black metal and harsh noise, bands like Trepaneringsritualen make it crystal clear that its effects were felt far and wide. <i>Perfection &amp; Permanence</i> is not a black metal record, but it’s no coincidence that it has resonated so strongly with those who perform and consume black metal. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Culumatively, the album makes for a perversely satisfying experience. With <i>Perfection &amp; Permanence</i>, Ekelund has created that most chimeric of beasts: an accessible, even what some might say commercial, noise album. The shadowy world of power electronics and by extension death industrial can be tough for a novice to navigate, but Trepaneringsritualen makes for an excellent starting point.</span></p></div>"|19500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19500-trepaneringsritualen-perfection-permanence/|6.6|Kim Kelly

He's an MPC-obliterating festival act, a trance-tweaking beatmaker of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15566-electronic-dream/""><i>Electric Dream</i></a> renown, and one of hip-hop's underrated secret-weapon producers. It's almost easy to forget that latter component of his resume, though, at least by comparison; when the EDM-adjacent buzz is throbbing almost as loud as the bassline, that'll take publicity precedence over, say, contributing the bulk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15391-gunz-n-butta/"">a pretty good Cam'ron &amp; Vado record</a>.</p>
<p>But Araab's still a beatmaker at the core, and even more so than the first installation, the sequel to last year's <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17697-araabmuzik-for-professional-use-only/""><i>For Professional Use Only</i></a> has the feel of a more traditional beat tape. That comes with all the mixed blessings that traditional beat tapes tend to be defined by: here's a direct feed to a producer's unadorned, uninhibited style, one that drastically careens between a fun listen for enthusiasts and a utilitarian toolkit. It's mixed, but it doesn't really set scenes or moods. It's a showcase for what makes his beats tick, but some moments feel incomplete and start to drag without actual MCs on the track. And even if his sound here swings further towards lower-key atmosphere better suited for box Chevys than rave tents, it's not iconoclastic enough to drop any surprises in his source material, hip-hop's Molly-hangover atmosphere, or his own discography in general.</p>
<p>As a complete front-to-back listen, Araab's sound proves not all that exciting in this beat-tape form, where good loops—""Life"" and its diamond-refraction chimes, the synth-string tension and trunk-denting bass bump of ""808v""—never quite turn into good songs and flag a bit after four minutes of verseless midtempo inertia. When he does lay an extended vocal sample down, the constant repetition runs the risk of grinding out all the meaning and impact, like it does when the old <i>The E</i><i>ducation of Sunny Carson</i> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMO2K1j5VCc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m2s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I got to take him off o' here""</a> diatribe of the ""260""/""The Bitch in Yoo"" sample is cut through ""White Collar"". Granted, straight-up instrumentals have their use; a clean 90 seconds of any of these tracks should keep a DJ set near peak highs, and every hip-hop radio station needs bumper music, but don't expect them to jump to the foreground and demand your attention unless you're a mixtape rapper in freestyle-candidacy mode. The form here is more <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16246-instrumental-university/""><i>Instrumental University</i></a> than the first <i>FPUO</i>, with a bit of difference-splitting that still acknowledges the way he's molded trance divas and hoover synths into his own building blocks the way a previous generation's producers upended R&amp;B.</p>
<p>But that's only sort-of-bad news, really, and the moody-EDM vibe that his originals and remixes thrive off is still welcome enough. Tracks like ""Don't Pretend 1.5"" (Super8 &amp; Tab's ""Black Is Back"" sifted through a foggy trap drumroll) and ""Ghost Story"" (a canny midtempo gothification of JES' ""Ghost (Deepsky Club Mix)"") pull some deep comedowns off minor-key melancholy, noir counterpoints (and counterparts) to the more blissed-out purveyors of cloud rap. What's left during the less mind-blowing moments, then, is an opportunity to bask in Araab's craft, pick up on how he still has a way of building and breaking down beats. Even his straight-up loops have a structure that's worth soaking in, where wallpapery bass churn conceals artfully timed snare rolls and skyscraper synths are built on a foundation of piston-punch drums.</p>
<p>Some of this material has already been successfully field-tested. ""Money Talks"" dropped as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpagXT7gOV8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Fabolous showcase</a> on last year's Funkmaster Flex release <i>Who You Mad At? Me or Yourself?</i>, and it made for a solid dose of vintage East Coast soul-loop flow accompaniment. ""Keep 100"" came out a couple months back as a Slaughterhouse cut, where its combination of spacey prog loops and concussion-causing drums made for a powerful shit-talk backdrop. And there are already a host of hopefuls who tackled ""Ghost Story"" and the Halloween car alarm banger ""Black Out"" when they were Soundcloud releases and made their own rap tracks over them. Maybe that's the real benefit of this record: motivating others into new levels of their own professionalism.</p></div>"|19664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19664-araabmuzik-for-professional-use-only-vol-2/|6.4|Nate Patrin

No, that’s not a summary of a special East Coast episode of “<a href=""http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Portlandia</a>”—this actually happened. <i>Break Line the Musical</i> is a song cycle written by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5506-yeasayer/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Yeasayer</a> vocalist/multi-instrumentalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12626-anand-wilder/"">Anand Wilder</a> and pianist Maxwell Kardon, and work on the project began a decade ago when they were fiddling around with a guitar and a banjo on a front porch in Philadelphia. They spent the next five years sporadically working on the songs and began putting them to tape in 2008; around that time, details of the project emerged, including the potential involvement of a gospel choir and plans to bring the production to the stage. The latter hasn’t happened yet, and if the liner notes for this recording are to be believed, the former never happened at all; regardless, Wilder and Kardon’s sense of ambition is inherent.</p>
<p>Considering Wilder’s main gig, the mere existence of <i>Break Line</i> makes some sense. Yeasayer’s buzz-generating 2007 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10805-all-hour-cymbals/""><i>All Hour Cymbals</i></a> leaned hard on proggy mysticism, while the melted pop structures of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13922-odd-blood/""><i>Odd Blood</i></a> from 2010 and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16940-fragrant-world/""><i>Fragrant World</i></a> from 2012 exuded a try-anything-once sense of adventurousness. While <i>Fragrant World</i> was a dismaying, grayed mix of muddy electronics and moody vocals that smacked of a band getting lost in their own heads, the initially divisive <i>Odd Blood</i> has aged better, its high points an intriguing realization of the psychedelic-pop promise <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"">some of their peers</a> once held. Even at their lowest, Yeasayer have never sounded “normal,” and it’s that relative weirdness that has, for the time being, drawn the curious towards the band and their associated projects.</p>
<p>In <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/new-album-yeasayer-anand-wilder-maxwell-kardon/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;smid=tw-tmagazine&amp;_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent interview with</a> <i>The T Magazine</i>, Wilder claims the pair looked to Celine Dion and music from the ‘70s for creative inspiration for this project. But despite those claims and his own pedigree as a moderately odd songwriter, the most surprising thing about <i>Break Line</i> is how <i>ordinary</i> the project sounds. These 11 songs are almost disarmingly straightforward and simplistic, adhering to the platitudes and rigid structures of a high school musical. From the harmonica that kicks off “Coal Into Diamonds”, featuring vocals from Aku Orraca-Tetteh of synth-proggers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5483-dragons-of-zynth/"">Dragons of Zynth</a>, it’s apparent that Wilder and Kardon weren’t interested in taking risks. But even after discarding any expectations brought to the table while approaching the project, <i>Break Line</i> is as an exceptionally dull collection of songs, with flickers of hammy theatricality weighed down by leaden arrangements that sound boring even by the standards set by modern self-important faux-indie music.</p>
<p>Heard as an album, the mid-tempo bombast and insufferable balladry of <i>Break Line</i> coalesces into flavorless mush, so maybe it’s better to approach it as a musical with a cohesive narrative. But it's no better on that level. Beyond the details already provided in the lead-up to the album’s release, few lyrics suggest a narrative—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27681-suckers/"">Suckers</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5755-quinn-walker/"">Quinn Walker</a> plaintively singing about blowing up coal mines over the folksy shuffle of “They’re Stealing Our Coal”, the ruminations on strikebreaking and lynching uttered by that same band’s Austin Fisher over the colorless plod of “Better to Die”. But even with a lyric sheet on hand, it’s impossible to understand what, exactly, <i>Break Line</i> is about.</p>
<p>Whatever sense of story exists comes from the rotating cast of vocalists: In addition to Walker, Fisher, Kardon, and Wilder, there’s Yeasayer co-lead singer Chris Keating, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a>’s Rostam Batmanglij, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a>’ Haley Dekle, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2938-man-man/"">Man Man</a>’s Honus Honus, among others. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"">MGMT</a>'s James Richardson and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30193-delicate-steve"">Delicate Steve</a> contribute instrumentally, but you can’t hear either in the music’s beige Americana.) With the exception of Wilder, who is painfully awkward on “Wedding Day”, none of these vocalists embarrass themselves. Honus Honus, in particular, has never sounded more at home than he does barking about “bombs in the mineshaft” over the coffee-shop blues of “It Doesn’t Seem Right”, a pairing so hilariously on-the-nose it scans as unintentional comedy.</p>
<p>The most notable contributors to <i>Break Line</i> are Yeasayer themselves. Three-quarters of the band’s current lineup pitches in, along with former member Jason Trammell. And while it’d be unfair to think of this record as the proper follow-up to <i>Fragrant World</i>, Wilder’s <a href=""https://twitter.com/amritsingh/status/476492074435358720"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent claims</a> that the band will be taking a more organic approach to their next album is, in the face of this collection’s plain-faced blahs, disheartening. For now, though, <i>Break Line</i> is a musical without an audience, and its creators might be better off if it fails to find one.</p></div>"|19644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19644-anand-wilder-break-line-the-musical/|3.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

The band's members, Glaswegians Stina Tweeddale (<a href=""http://boycotts.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Boycotts</a>) and Shona McVicar (<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/partwindpartwolf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Partwindpartwolf</a>), met at a show both acts were playing and bonded over being women in their respective bands—in Tweeddale’s case, the <i>only</i> woman in the band—as well as the music they grew up with. <i>Thrift Shop</i>'s crunchy cover of The Innocence Mission’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m-hJ1XH0I0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Girl on My Left</a>”—an inspired choice from a 1990s act with a devoted cult fanbase—spoke to both connective threads.</p>
<p>Honeyblood have since signed to <a href=""http://www.fat-cat.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fat Cat</a> and scrubbed out the static with producer Peter Katis (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol/"">Interpol</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a>); inevitably, the duo have picked up a slew of comparisons to acts of the past (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4232-throwing-muses/"">Throwing Muses</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"">Hole</a>) that Honeyblood have also mentioned as influences. However, the band has no shortage of current-day peers, from hypermelodic rock acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"">Best Coast</a>, countrymates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/"">Camera Obscura</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz/"">Speedy Ortiz</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31640-courtney-barrett/"">Courtney Barnett</a> (whom Honeyblood opened for). So it can be hard to hear the duo's self-titled debut<i> </i>on its own terms, but<i> Honeyblood </i>is far from pastiche: they don’t sound <i>that </i>much like their influence, except perhaps in how they arrange their harmonies or in short three-second bursts. The first bars of “Choker”, in particular, could fool a few people into thinking it’s a Deal sister singing; the raised-eyebrow inflections on “No Spare Key” are unnerving exact matches to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1128-tanya-donelly/"">Tanya Donelly</a>’s repertoire.</p>
<p>One part of ‘90s indie lineage that usually goes unmentioned among the nostalgics is that the era's albums tended to dissolve into filler in the back third, and <i>Honeyblood </i>is no exception. Just looking at the album's tracklist, you can almost pinpoint the spot where they’ll<i> </i>break the monotony with an uptempo cut—in this case, the clipped exasperation and petulant shout-along of “All Dragged Up”—but for the most part, <i>Honeyblood </i>admirably sidesteps the potential pitfalls. Some bands record lo-fi albums as a statement of purpose; others because that’s all they could afford. Honeyblood were previously in the latter position, and as a result their debut doesn’t sound overproduced as much as it does properly heightened, like a well-developed photograph.  The lovelorn “Fall Forever” melts on record like a sugarcube, “No Spare Key” and single “Bud” receive a clean frame around their lyrics, “Killer Bangs” is properly raucous, and the quieter “Super Rat” is gracefully produced, with guitars that initially sound like little pirouettes escalating the song to the level of ripping contempt: “SCUM! BAG! SLEAZE! SLIME! BALL! GREASE!”</p>
<p>As you might imagine from that exultation, <i>Honeyblood </i>is populated by the canonical post-riot-grrrl cast of characters: asshole dudes, and the women exasperated or over them in the most cathartic ways. But though Tweeddale’s still working through growing pains as a lyricist—for every great opening salvo, there’s a throat-clearing hedge—<i>Honeyblood’</i>s got a sense of voice some debut acts would be lucky to possess. “Choker”, in particular, feints past platitudes and scumball-sleaze dude clichés to become something more layered; it was inspired by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloody_Chamber"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Angela Carter’s story “The Bloody Chamber,”</a> about a bride marrying a man implied to be the <a href=""http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/515876/Marquis-de-Sade"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marquis de Sade</a>, whose wedding gift is a choker of “flashing crimson jewels round [her] throat, bright as arterial blood”; the song, accordingly, whiplashes from hooky to doomy to unnervingly placid. It’s not exactly a <i>dark</i> song<i>, </i>though, which is key, as the best moments on <i>Honeyblood </i>work in complex emotions.</p>
<p>“Biro” is the most wistful track on the album, a late-summer wash that sounds gorgeous on record. It possesses the record's most lasting hook, as well as its most indelible line: “All the pain you’ve been through will be the making of you.” It works both as something to take to heart and a to-date career statement, as the making of <i>Honeyblood</i> turned out all right, after all. </p></div>"|19589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19589-honeyblood-honeyblood/|6.8|Katherine St. Asaph

Knowing that vocalist/guitarist Adam Moerder and drummer Nick Sylvester are music critics (both have written for Pitchfork and elsewhere) made that exultation in musical influences even sweeter: these were music geeks, geeking out about the stuff they love, in song form. It wasn’t all as reductive as that, though; there were still touches of sarcasm, cynicism, and slyness found in those two releases, a self-awareness about the open appropriation of musical heroes. But with the group’s posthumous full-length, <i><a href=""http://mrdreamland.us/post/90389977612/entergodmode-ultimate-in-luxury-the-new-and"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ultimate in Luxury</a></i>, that swirl of perk and punk has turned a little sour.</p>
<p>The loving pastiches of indie-rock past are still there, but Mr. Dream has flipped the calendar forward dramatically. “Making Muscles” slips, shudders, and shivers in a gut-churning approximation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/731-chavez/"">Chavez</a>’s art-drone lope. It’s ’90s alt-rock turned in on itself until it knots up into prog, but it can't help but come across as a thought experiment and not a particularly dimensional one, despite Moerder’s attempt to stab some of the prickly atmospherics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23514-public-image-ltd"">Public Image Ltd.</a>’s “Theme” into the mix—an element the track doesn’t have room for, let alone need.</p>
<p><i>Ultimate in Luxury</i> inches backward from there, but only briefly. Bits of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a> emerge, particularly on “Cheap Heat,” an adrenaline-injected take on the icicle jangle of ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0c20cjbmD4&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Needle in the Camel’s Eye</a>”—complete with Moerder trying to hit the stars with his high notes—and the cheeky call for “rock ’n’ roll patricide” on “Bloodmobile”, as if driving the nail in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">Bowie</a>’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jg4ekLG9Zo&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rock ’n’ Roll Suicide</a>.” It’s clever, and it says nothing. Even worse, it that frame of reference is at odds with the early-00s dance-punk of “Fringy Slider”—which, regardless of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a>-esque name, approximates the sashay of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1605-franz-ferdinand/"">Franz Ferdinand</a>—and “Work Faster”, which boogies as clumsily as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1093-the-dismemberment-plan"">Dismemberment Plan</a> song dressed as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/916-chk-chk-chk/"">!!!</a> song for Halloween. Bassist Matt Morello unfurls some monstrous, art-funk low-end, but Sylvester’s half-hearted hand with disco rhythms somehow has the power to make a drum kit sound sarcastic.</p>
<p>Sincerity is as much of a false virtue as originality, and Mr. Dream know it, maybe too well. Scattershot instead of eclectic, tentative instead of thoughtful, tracks such as the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1725-girls-against-boys/"">Girls Against Boys</a>-leaning “Loud Tools” and the jittery “Sad Bastard Unit” can’t seem to decide if they even believe in themselves, let alone what they might be trying to convey. That is, until the album’s final three songs. “Watched It Wrong”, “Just Results”, and “Mouth Off” are catchy, dynamic, and astringent in all the right ways and places. Moerder’s dissonant string-bends, plucked straight out of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYPDJg9mz1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Scentless Apprentice</a>”, actually click into place on “Watched It Wrong”, as does his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6554-mark-e-smith/"">Mark E. Smith</a> snarl-croon on “Mouth Off.” Inspiration and perspiration finally meet, mingle, and melt.</p>
<p>Those three songs would be more suited to the kickoff of their next album than the end of this one; it’s a shame that album won’t come. Sometimes the only thing separating a middling band from a magnificent one isn’t just the ability to write and play strong songs, but to do so consistently and convincingly. If <i>Ultimate in Luxury</i> had been able to fully seize and own that potential, Mr. Dream might have left a better aftertaste.</p></div>"|19641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19641-mr-dream-ultimate-in-luxury/|6.1|Jason Heller

There are entire labels affiliated with the genre that are dedicated to the idea of preserving the old, signing a glut of bands that, at best, unfavorably smack of the innovators they're so slavishly devoted. So California duo <a href=""http://wreckandreference.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wreck and Reference</a> provide a radical vision of what the metal of the future might look like with their latest album, <i>Want</i>. Their version of metal does not have guitars, bass, leather, devil horns, or any other metal tropes; their arsenal is comprised of  a sampler, drums, voice, and bottomless despair.</p>
<p>Limited instrumentation does not stop Wreck and Reference from bringing in a range of dark sounds, as they have a habit of flipping their own script quickly. This is evident from the smooth transition from the industrial squeals of opener “Corpse Museum” into the piano-driven “Apollo Beneath The Whip”, or the shift from the dimly-lit lurch of “Bankrupt” to their interpretation of doom metal on “A Glass Cage For An Animal”. <i>Want</i> maintains a consistent atmosphere throughout, excelling even as it broadens and warps the definition of metal. Felix Skinner, who handles electronics and some vocals, conjures up the closest thing to big, blocky riffs that an experimental effort like this can offer, feeding them through dehumanized filters.</p>
<p>While Wreck and Reference are redefining metal, “Whip” is their most metal song in a sense, mainly because of its enveloping buildup. As drummer Ignat Frege gets busier, Skinner’s piano sounds more nervous, and his vocals sound grander in their misery, resembling a charismatic preacher that wants to swallow you in the greater void. The songs on <i>Want </i>are too diverse for Wreck and Reference to possess a “signature song,” but “Whip” deserves to become one of their staples.</p>
<p>For a band driven by electronics, it might seem that using a drum machine would make the most sense, Frege serves as both a compliment and a foil to Skinner, amplifying his movements without going overboard. He also takes a freer approach to drumming on <i>Want</i>, removing blast beats from his repertoire; on “Museum”, he flirts with the technique but ends up holding back just enough to lend a looseness that works with Skinner's electronic freakouts. Frege's cymbal rides on “Bankrupt” are tense, making Skinner’s howls and spare electronic hums loom even more dreadfully. It's often perceived that hitting the snare and double bass hard and fast is a surefire way to sound “heavy”, but Frege challenges that notion by doing more with less. His performance is such a secret weapon that it’s quite missed on “Machine of Confusion”, an ambient break that is the only song not to contain drums.</p>
<p>Amidst the boundless experimentation, there's one flickering light of traditional metal on <i>Want</i>. Closing track “Apologies” features swells that are oddly reminiscent of the opening to ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2WRGVJLZu0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cathedral</a>”, Eddie Van Halen’s solo guitar piece on 1982’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diver_Down"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Diver Down</i></a> where he gorgeously replicated a church organ. ""Apologies"" is the closest thing the album comes to providing a comforting presence, in terms of both lushness and familiarity, but it’s still buried beneath the overbearing existentialism that Skinner and Frege traffic in, its beauty interrupted by faint snare rolls and creeping static.</p>
<p>Most metal groups are either blind to the future or are scared shitless by it. Wreck and Reference take on what’s on the horizon, and while most metal groups are content to yell that they don’t give a fuck, Skinner and Frege put it into principle too. Metal claims to be challenging, but on <i>Want</i>, Wreck and Reference go one step further, challenging the genre's practicioners to pull themselves out of complacency.</p></div>"|19492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19492-wreck-reference-want/|7.7|Andy O'Connor

She coos and squawks, mews and barks, murmurs and wails, as though singing in a new language. One minute she sounds like an opera singer, the next like a mother baby-talking to her new daughter. The effect can be dizzying, and the illegibility of her performance only makes it more, not less, human. Yet, a few words do stand out, primarily that title phrase: “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtBr5JKSuks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heaven or Las Vegas</a>.” The Cocteau Twins’ music has always sounded otherworldly, and their many fans would certainly describe it—and rightly so—as heavenly.</p>
<p>But Las Vegas? It stands out as an odd, jarring reference. Their fantastical music would seem to brook nothing quite so earthly, so garish, so <i>thisworldly</i> as Sin City, which hauls unlikely baggage into “Heaven or Las Vegas”: gambling, corruption, tacky tourism, and cheesy crooning. But if we forget everything we know about the city and reduce Las Vegas to its atomic elements—millions upon billions of lights—perhaps we might see heaven in the radiance. This is essentially how the Cocteau Twins’ music works: Fraser’s voice doesn’t behave the way a pop singer’s voice typically behaves, nor does Guthrie’s guitar deliver the usual melody or rhythm. Along with bass player/keyboardist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24257-simon-raymonde/"">Simon Raymonde</a>, whose contributions shouldn’t be discounted, they found new ways to use old instruments in the 1980s, in the process devising a unique and wholly beguiling sound. If punk had chased beauty instead of glorious ugliness, if goth had emphasized light rather than fetishize darkness, those movements might have sounded like the Cocteau Twins, who had contemporaries but no real peers. Somehow, there is immense aggression and subversion in the sheer loveliness of this music, which makes it more than just art for art’s sake.</p>
<p>Most people in America, however, didn’t know any of this in the 1980s, as the decade was almost over before the band officially released any music in the States. Ever since Guthrie and Fraser had shown up on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=4ad"">4AD Records</a>’ doorstep like orphaned goths in 1982, the Scots quickly developed both a sound and an audience in the UK, culminating in the 1984 album <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_(Cocteau_Twins_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Treasure</i></a>, which was the first to truly capture the wildness of Fraser’s vocals and Guthrie’s ambitiously skewed arrangements. By the late '80s, they were successful enough to play increasingly cavernous London venues, to build their own 24-track studio, to rent practice space in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5873-pete-townshend/"">Pete Townshend</a>’s building. There was also friction between Fraser and Guthrie, who had been a couple throughout the life of the Cocteau Twins. Due to the pressure of the business and especially to Guthrie’s rampant drug abuse, their marriage was fraying. But they still made beautiful music together, and they signed a deal with <a href=""http://www.capitolrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Capitol Records</a> to distribute their fifth album, 1988’s <i>Blue Bell Knoll</i>, in America.</p>
<p>That album is one of two getting a deluxe vinyl reissue this week via 4AD. It’s certainly a pivotal album in their career, but not necessarily one of their best. Did the Cocteau Twins tame some of their wilder elements for American audiences? Or did the prospect of reaching a whole new continent of ears even enter their minds when they recorded these songs? <i>Blue Bell Knoll </i>sounds minimalist, workmanlike at times, never quite matching the rapturous invention of <i>Treasure</i>. It’s their airiest, cottoniest album, with an enticing use of space on the production but with hooks that sound oddly restrained. As a result, it can sound as monochromatic as its album cover.</p>
<p>On the other hand, its general dismissal by critics and fans as a lesser Cocteau Twins album may have less to do with the album itself and more to do with the fact that it is bookended by better and more ecstatically creative works. There are moments of disarming beauty on <i>Blue Bell Knoll</i>—the melting keyboards on “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psLO9HxlPC8&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cico Buff</a>”, the lush vocal layering of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a6NzSuUosI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Athol-Brose</a>”, the shooting-stars opening of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5o5hVSgrK4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Kissed Out Red Floatboat</a>”, Raymonde’s syncopated bass trudge of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7_GB9R43T4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Itchy Glowblo Blow</a>”, the <i>whatever that is </i>at the end of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK9ULgXuAE4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spooning Good Singing Gum</a>” (I think it might be a herd of lovelorn goats playing saxophones). But the standout is “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh83z5vIP0w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carolyn’s Fingers</a>”, which would become the Cocteau Twins’ first American single. The band never utilized its rhythm section to better effect: Against Guthrie’s crisp guitar line, that churning momentum pushes Fraser’s vocals to greater and greater heights, her unexpected swoops and eloquently rolled consonants creating a bewildering indie-pop aria.</p>
<p>Even as the band soared commercially and creatively, personally they suffered. Between the release of <i>Blue Bell Knoll</i> and the recording of <i>Heaven or Las Vegas</i>, Fraser gave birth to the couple’s first child, a daughter, yet Guthrie remained deep in the throes of drug addiction, which made him paranoid and angry. Raymonde mourned the death of his father. Suddenly the stakes for the Cocteau Twins seemed impossibly high. “Fraser named the album <i>Heaven or Las Vegas</i> [as] a suggestion of music versus commerce, or perhaps a gamble, one last throw of the dice,” Martin Aston writes in <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9281-facing-the-other-way-the-story-of-4ad/"">Facing the Other Way: The Story of 4AD</a></i>, implying that the band was close to imploding.</p>
<p>Instead, they turned all that turmoil and uncertainty into the best album of their career. <i>Heaven or Las Vegas</i> explodes in Technicolor from the first melty guitar chords on “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WybSSagVvoU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cherry-Coloured Funk</a>”. Every note sounds like a new and richer shade of indigo and scarlet and violet than the previous one, and it doesn’t fade until closer “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPdNp3Qbgw8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Frou-Frou Foxes in Midsummer Fires</a>” descends into silence. If <i>Blue Bell Knoll </i>is spare and ambient, <i>Heaven</i> is supersaturated: lush without being vulgar, luxuriant without being indulgent. Tellingly, some lyrics bubble up to the surface, often loaded with personal meaning: “cherry,” “perfection,” “burn this madhouse down.” On a song called “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBzwWgFzggw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pitch the Baby</a>”, ostensibly written for—or at least sung to—the couple’s infant daughter, Fraser repeats, “I’m so happy to care for you, I only want to love you,” as a sweet lullaby. We may not always be able to understand her lyrics, but that doesn’t mean they’re not important. In fact, her lyrics would never be more vital or confessional than they are on <i>Heaven or Las Vegas</i>, which lends the music added emotional and conceptual heft.</p>
<p>What’s particularly remarkable about the album is how compact it is: All but two of these 10 tracks clock in around three-and-a-half minutes, and the whole thing is over and done with in a mere 38 minutes. That succinctness may have something to do with Raymonde’s increasing role in the group. His bass playing, especially on “Pitch the Baby” and “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIs6uc440Z4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fotzepolitic</a>”, not only adds to the texture and, yes, the groove of the music, but also gingerly anchors these songs: He prevents them from flying off into the ether, but never lets them grow rigid or staid. The result is an album that perfectly balances ambition with accessibility. Together, these two releases—which were their last for 4AD—present the Cocteau Twins as first and foremost a pop band, and pop rarely sounds as transformative and as transfixing as it does here. </p></div>"|19526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19526-cocteau-twins-blue-bell-knollheaven-or-las-vegas/|8.3|Stephen Deusner

The Houston-born, Los Angeles-based Davis Jr. was reared in the gospel world and played piano in blues clubs on the Third Coast, but also spent time in the Bay Area, where he purportedly ghostwrote lyrics for rappers and toured as a member of MC Hammer’s gospel choir.</p>
<p>While the aforementioned gigs on his résumé suggest a knack for working in the background across many disciplines, only in the last few years did his own words and music gain traction. Working with another L.A. producer <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/kutmah-beats"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kutmah</a> (since deported back to the UK) brought his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28083-dam-funk/"">Dâm-Funk</a>-indebted demos to light as <a href=""http://izwid.bandcamp.com/album/the-lost-tapes-vol-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Lost Tapes Vol. 1</i></a>. With <i>Friends</i>, his newest two-track single released on Derrick Carter and Luke Solomon’s <a href=""http://www.theclassicmusiccompany.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Classic Records</a> label, Davis Jr. meets and exceeds the often mutually exclusive wallflower demands of pop and house music. As last year’s “One” and the more recent <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/apronrecords/sets/seven-davis-jr-p-a-r-t-y-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>P.A.R.T.Y.</i> EP</a> from earlier this year have proven, Davis Jr. is adept at crafting an infectious pop song <i>and</i> a body-tweaking beat, making them both convene in joyous nexus. He touches upon bedroom funk, old soul, and underground house with equal aplomb. And judging by <i>Life in Deep Space</i>, his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Life-Deep-Space-Seven-Davis-ebook/dp/B00C4KCL74/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390256476&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=life+in+deep+space+seven+davis"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">e-folio of poems</a>, he’s as taken by cosmic turns of phrase as he is by a tight beat.</p>
<p>Clocking in at 127 BPM, “Friends” is built up from a mouth-hummed bassline that brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland"">Timbaland</a> (and also serves as a rubber band stretching from doo-wop to Kenny Dixon Jr.). “Friends” expresses a sentiment familiar to fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson"">Michael Jackson</a>’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6P7aQtNpsA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Working Day and Night</a>” or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"">Mac DeMarco</a>, in that Davis Jr. works all week and looks forward to the weekend. There need not be a simpler chorus than: “It feels good to be/ Be with all my friends.” There’s echoing handclaps, a simmering hi-hat, and the gentlest scent of synths, all held together by Davis Jr.’s almost blasé vocal delivery. That he can sound so casual on “Friends” is not a chance result, as Davis is careful in his craftsmanship—how he spaces the track, how his vocal blurs into the beat. One gets the impression that Davis Jr. could putter about his house humming to himself and come up with an enticing track.</p>
<p>“Beautiful” clocks in at the same tempo as “Friends” but feels more hectic, with keys, thumps and vaporized vocals zooming about the field. He extends and teases out the line “Never gonna let ya go” with the kind of finesse that brings to mind the towering thrills of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4929-vocalcity/""><i>Vocalcity</i></a>, but Davis Jr.’s mindful to bring the pop payoff much sooner, cooing “You’re so beautiful” in his finest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> come-on (which makes sense, considering <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu_6pVJTVEo&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he did a fine rendering of “Controversy”</a> late last year). He utters that line right as spine-tingling synth arises.</p>
<p>On the digital version of <i>Friends</i>, he adds on a live edit of “One”–which is now a pricey single in the online market—which is as joyous a vocal house track as any I’ve heard in the past few years. It’s a love song about a special chemistry, the chorus up-front and earnest: “Wassup with you and me?/ I’m thinking maybe you’re the one.” It’s a house track that doubles as a great pop song, the kick as giddy as a heart in the first palpitations of love.</p></div>"|19601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19601-seven-davis-jr-friends-ep/|7.9|Andy Beta

<p>Much of <i>Here Comes Now</i> takes the form of electro-powered free jazz, and as a whole skips merrily by—a listener could be forgiven for not recognizing the album’s core concept (which is driven home by a track named for <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-Stephen-Hawking/dp/0553380168"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stephen Hawking’s <i>A Brief History of Time</i></a>) on the first few spins. But Alexander isn’t a dilettante in either of his fields: he received his physics doctorate from Brown University and currently holds an associate professorship at Dartmouth, and he also considers music, particularly improvisational jazz, an important element of his academic pursuits.</p>
<p>Rioux's propulsive, cheery beats give the album its momentum. The music mostly races forward with gently twinkling synths and drums, punctuated by long saxophone solos and short riffs. Perhaps the most involved example of the duo's sound comes on the xylophone-incorporating “I Guess We’re Floating”. It features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2490-arto-lindsay/"">Arto Lindsay</a> and possesses a great chorus, which takes the shape of an elongated appeal to keeping faith and letting go.</p>
<p>The silliness on <i>Here Comes Now</i> mostly comes from the lyrics, which tend to take the form of mantras:  “I just want to be the person that I am in my mind,” “The light in you, the darkness in you/ It’s all precious.”  These clichéd sentiments can grate, but they’re also reassuring to hear emanating from someone as smart as Alexander. The album’s other weak spots come when Rioux and Alexander fail to balance each other out.  There may be a grounding scientific concept that helps to justify the existence of slower, sax-heavy tracks like “Running from the Cosmos” and “Ornette’s Vortex”, but their presence hurts the record’s pacing and threaten to relegate it to the realm of background music; Rioux’s influence is less obvious on these tracks, and the music suffers for it.</p>
<p>But even if <i>Here Comes Now</i> doesn’t always hold the listener’s attention, it <i>is</i> extraordinarily pleasant as background music. Alexander investigates big questions for a living and the finesse he shows here, in tandem with Rioux, allows the duo to ably sidestep expectations and deliver an album that fulfills the promise of its concept.</p></div>"|19576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19576-rioux-stephon-alexander-here-comes-now/|7.2|Jonah Bromwich

The New York trio’s music is H20-logged and woozily off-speed, as if they’ve been playing in the deep end so long their notes and beats have contracted a case of the bends. The resulting effect is simultaneously close and distant. Some individual elements, like the looping guitar riffs and the machinistic drum beats, feel close enough to touch. Yet every inch of </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Sunburner </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">is muffled and drenched as if it's wearing a sweater in 100-degree weather; at times, it resembles a </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division </a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">record played under a stack of mattresses.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">That sounds like a formula for a downer slog of an album, but sealing United Waters’ songs in a claustrophobic envelope makes them more engaging. The way the wiry guitar lines creep toward the surface, and the way Brian Sullivan’s doubled moans rise from the buried tunes like ghosts, beckons you to dive for more. It’s a feat Sullivan is used to pulling off; his excellent noise-rock duo </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2989-mouthus/"">Mouthus</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> spent most of the 2000s baking together layers of sound that you could spend hours peeling away. They became so skilled at it they could even turn a Fleetwood Mac </span><a href=""http://youtu.be/9qFXdgqCcq8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> into a growling industrial </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><a href=""http://youtu.be/J_ksWZUXGmY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cycle</a>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Nothing on </span><i>Sunburner </i><span>is that abstract, but United Waters isn't that radical a departure for Sullivan. He's long had a warped sense of time and an obsession with density, and those traits persist despite these songs being ostensibly simpler than what Mouthus normally made. He indulges in a love of repeition, riding out hooks and humming melodies until they attain the power of mantras. It’s so easy to be hypnotized by those loops that you might not realize how far the band has traveled until you’re suddenly adrift in one of their foamy crescendos. Their patience in crafting those waves makes the crests feel earned rather than gratuitous.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That dedication also gives </span><i>Sunburner </i><span>an uncanny familiarity, as inside all the reflecting echoes lie figures that feel elusively classic. The six-feet-under sonics overlap with the lo-fi rattle of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29375-dirty-beaches/""><span>Dirty Beaches</span></a><span>, but where Alex Zhang Hungtai’s tunes tend toward garage, </span><i>Sunburner </i><span>feels more like smeared pop. The music here is also reminiscent of the point in </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3782-sightings/""><span>Sightings</span></a><span>’ career when they shed some clamor, and Mark Morgan’s vocals went from desperate yell to eerie moan. But part of the fascination there was hearing the absence of all-out noise; with United Waters, there’s nothing missing. The songs are enjoyable strictly as songs, not so much as contrasts to what could be.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So when the guitars twist into knots on “Turn On Your Century”, or engines rev at the end of the title track, or the rock turns to roll halfway through “Out of Flight”, it’s not just impressive to behold—it’s fun to listen to as well. Granted, that was also true of Mouthus’ best stuff, but with <i>Sunburner</i>, it's not necessary to burrow into a genre or be attracted to a specific sensibility to get locked into the music. The songs are magnetic enough to do all the pulling for you.</span></p></div>"|19527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19527-united-waters-sunburner/|7.7|Marc Masters

For BeatKing—the self-professed “Club God”—the strip club is not just an inspiration, but his entire milieu, his kingdom. <i>GSM2</i> is a triple-X-rated rap record, where a song called “Smile” has nothing to do with the face; if you have trouble separating the attitudes professed in music from real life, or are put off by graphic depictions of sex acts from aggressively macho personalities, read no further. But if your main concern is one dimensional subject matter, or the way BeatKing unapologetically re-upholsters current trends (the “We Dem Boyz” “Hol’ up! Hol’ up! Hol’ up!” chant, or multiple uses of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a> flow), don’t be dissuaded. These rap cliches are mere tools in the service of much more purposeful ends: personality, wit, and a novel approach to sound and songwriting.<br/><br/>BeatKing is, in essence, a Houston punchline rapper making crunk records, but he's one of the biggest rappers in Texas right now because the sum is so much more than those parts. For a record that holds onto all the formal elements of a Southern strip club record, identifying the ephemeral gestures that comprise BeatKing’s persona can be a challenge. But from his punchlines to his barked delivery to the raunchy interludes (one skit is excerpted from a radio appearance, in which a fan calls in with an offer for oral sex), it’s the elusive spine of personality that makes <i>Gangsta Stripper Music 2</i> a worthy listen.<br/><br/>At first, BeatKing built his fanbase in the usual way: freestyling with friends, distributing <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2014/04/beatking-houston-rapper-rap-songs-viral-videos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">”Sharpie-marked CDs”</a>, and hustling his wares to regional radio. But in 2011, he hit upon a formula that propelled him to the top of Houston’s competitive rap food chain, offering a quick, reactive rapping commentary on whichever shocking viral video made the rounds on social media that day. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwtjIQ8z7Dc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I wait until stupid shit happens,”</a> he explained in the introduction to his ""Amber Cole Freestyle"", “And then I freestyle about it.” The freestyles were like running Greek chorus commentary, irreverent clowning not unlike the kind you’ll find on Twitter. He turns these records over quickly—he told <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2014/04/beatking-houston-rapper-rap-songs-viral-videos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Complex</a> that it took him an hour to record his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjXUdlLkCLQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Sharkeisha” freestyle</a>. His rapping often resembles <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dozens%E2%80%9D%20target=%E2%80%9D_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Dozens</a>, and this think-on-your-feet humor is at the core of his rap style. On <i>Gangsta Stripper Music 2</i>, this style is adapted to a stronger, more varied sonic canvas—although that improvisational edge is still present in his rapping. <br/><br/>BeatKing is large: everything about his music is constructed to emphasize mass and dimension. His voice—that gruff, forceful baritone—conveys heft, and he’s drawn to punchy flows, like those of Migos or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30559-lil-reese/"">Lil Reese</a>. His ‘drop’ is based upon the first two notes of the theme from <i>Jaws</i>. The 808-driven beats he chooses sound enormous and seem designed to imply physical presence; the mixtape’s climactic record <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVRAB7wbww8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Club Godzilla”</a> is most explicit in its size, with anvil-hammering drums, shouted background vocals, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opby-PrzfoM&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">echoing horns</a>, and roaring Godzilla effects. And then there’s his lyrics, where mass is always in motion: “Throw that ass back, like a boomerang.” Sound reverberates viscerally: “Four 15s hittin’, I can feel the bass on my balls.” And then there’s a more mythic, enduring grandiosity: “Never fall off, flex forever.”<br/><br/>Although the music is belligerent, his lyrics are playfully irreverent. His punchlines are the album’s Easter eggs, the kind of lewd cracks delivered with a straight face for totally guilty, juvenile laughs, as on ""Strip Club Trappin'"": “She throwin’ ass on Instagram in the hotel/ When she sucked my dick it made me happy like Pharrell”. (No need to go into how he makes “Babe Ruth” rhyme with “Babe Ruth.”) These punchlines, out of context, lose a bit of their luster; the reason they’re so funny in his songs is how little attention he draws to them, like an incidental byproduct of his craft. His bellowing delivery, and the album’s overall intensity, don’t crack.<br/><br/>This off-the-cuff balance of bombast and humor proves that each is essential to the process. (On “Been Thru,” BeatKing goes for straightlaced seriousness—perhaps out of deference to the song’s role as a feature for H-Town legend <a href=""http://iam7thirteen.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lil Keke</a>—but abandons the rapper’s signature charm.) It’s also clear that a lot of forethought went into the record’s presentation. Conceptually, <i>Gangsta Stripper Music 2</i> flips through a variety of creative ideas without abandoning the overall BeatKing style—everything from the titanic “Clubgodzilla” beat to the way “Smile” repurposes Bell Biv Devoe’s hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7m16mrY-l4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“When Will I See You Smile Again?”</a> for a song about a, well, different kind of smile. <br/><br/>“Stunt N!gga” swipes its hook from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12128-birdman/"">Birdman</a>’s now-classic adlibs on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>’s “The Language”; that track also displays the breadth of BeatKing’s lyrical talents, with some of his most deft rapping in its second half. There are Memphis tribute records with <a href=""https://twitter.com/GangstaBooQOM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gangsta Boo</a> (“Dat Bag”) and <a href=""https://twitter.com/SkinnyPimp999"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skinny Pimp</a> (“Powder 2014”), poignant stripper devotionals (the potentially single-ready “Keisha”), and a monumentally regal closer (“End of the Day”). Much like his lyrically-lyrical Texas counterpart <a href=""http://doughbeezy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Doughbeezy</a>, BeatKing has forged a new path for Texas rappers that is at once of history without being hobbled by it.</p></div>"|19623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19623-beatking-gangsta-stripper-music-2/|7.5|David Drake

It is a blinding place to touch down, like being deposited ass-first and blind-folded onto a five-lane superhighway. United Nations are a complicated semi-lark that Rickly, former lead singer of <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/261348-Thursday"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thursday</a>, has kept going in some form or another since 2005, and they have always practiced warfare via confusion. Their music is the point where unreadable intentions meet white-hot conviction: you might not know what they mean, exactly, but you understand they mean it with every fiber of their being. ""This is serious business,"" Rickly shrieks on the song, a line with about seven trap doors around it. Seconds after he utters it, one of them yawns open: What is that familiar melody the chords are tracing? Oh right, that's the central motif of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5z_l6NE3qs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Phantom of the fucking Opera</i></a>. </p>
<p>It's a fascinating little quote, intentional or not, and it winks at the central concern of <i>The Next Four Years</i>: punk rock as (possibly exhausted) theater, and how a sagging, ticket-sale-hoovering mainstream behemoth like <i>Phantom</i> might have more in common with hardcore than meets the eye. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9449-united-nations/"">Speaking with Pitchfork</a>, Rickly was full of sardonic observations about the ways in which punk subcultures are inherently a series of petty squabbles: ""It's maybe 10 different layers of hypocrisy: everything from a Minor Threat T-shirt being $28 at Urban Outfitters, to that being a thing where somebody would set up a whole set of ideals to combat the $28 Minor Threat shirt, to the fact that Minor Threat accidentally started straight-edge in the first place. There's so many layers to what's wrong with that.""</p>
<p>In response, he's built <i>The Next Four Years</i> as an elaborate joke. The album is structured around the fake mythology of a band, beginning with their first cassette detailing their earliest days and progressing through two slightly more melodic and doomier 7""s before landing on what he calls the band's ""<a href=""http://www.self-titledmag.com/2014/07/02/interview-geoff-rickly-on-modern-art-united-nations-thursdays-abrupt-split-and-the-launch-of-his-new-band-and-label/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pretentious phase of trying to sound like Godspeed! You Black Emperor</a>."" If you purchase the <a href=""http://shop.temporaryresidence.com/trr234"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">limited-edition box set from Temporary Residence</a>, you can find these thematic distinctions made physical: A black tape, wrapped in the actual cease-and-desist order Rickly's band received from the real UN, two 7""s, and a 10"" inch record. The packaging is covered in fake news stories from 2016-2021; in one, United Nations perform songs from their debut (""now available on vinyl as well as direct mindlink"") in North Korea.</p>
<p>It's a stunning product and a black-belt level conceptual framework. Paging through it all, you can close your eyes and see the message board posts proliferating in its wake. But when you actually listen to the album, all of this subtext flies past you like fine print on the side of a bullet train. It's true that after an initial burst of of furiously scraping songs (""Serious Business, ""Meanwhile On Main Street,"" ""Revolutions At Varying Speeds""), the sound opens up slightly, allowing more space in between the hail of kick drums for richer melodies to bloom. And toward the back half, interludes of brooding clean-toned guitars (""F#A#$"") bring the music to a brief resting pulse.  </p>
<p>But taken as a whole, <i>The Next Four Years</i> moves like a piece of fine engineering—all curved lines, no wind resistance. ""Revolutions at Varying Speeds"" enters a cycle so brutal in its final seconds that it seems to be reversing on its axis. The same thing happens on ""Between Two Mirrors"" where the drums push the song gently into a wind sprint that gradually and gracefully winds back down, the song resting its hands on its knees and panting. There are little ghosts of melodies lurking here and there, in the interplay between the bass and the minor chords, and occasionally in the vocal lines.</p>
<p>Rickly has expressed concern that listeners will miss ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9449-united-nations/"">the jokes</a>"" on <i>The</i> <i>Next Four Years</i>, which mostly take the form of self-inflicted gut blows and eye jabs. When he sings ""Everything That We Touch Is Made for Sale"" on ""Meanwhile On Main Street"", it's difficult to parse if it's a sincere sentiment or Rickly pulling a face at us. This is a band that started out performing in Reagan masks, after all, and good ol' Reagan's face shows up on the box set packaging in a very <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1266-dead-kennedys/"">Dead Kennedys</a>-esque collage. The punchline, in the end, might be that poking punk hypocrisy in the eye feels as familiar and unsurprising as punk itself. Subcultures are necessarily in love with rules—when you strip a subculture down to its skeleton, after all, what remains is a handful of rules—and Rickly ends the album, on ""Music For Changing Parties"", with the following chant: ""Changing parties/ Always the same/ Changing lives/ Always the same/ Changing hearts/ Always the same/ Changing minds/ Always the same."" </p>
<p>All of these Easter eggs help make United Nations an album fun to think about when it's not playing. But parsing <i>The Next Four Years</i> too closely, at least while it's on, flies in the face of the music's reason for being—that is, to blur together moments, to speed up time. Slowing it down would kill it, and the highest compliment I can pay <i>The Next Four Years</i> is that, no matter how often I play it, it's over before I've had time to think. Then, perplexed yet exhilarated, I play it again.</p></div>"|19638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19638-united-nations-the-next-four-years/|8.1|Jayson Greene

The moniker is fitting in its audacity and camp, as well as a celebration of Los Angeles as both city and symbol.</p>
<p><i>Friend of Mine</i> is built on ecstatic forms of house and techno, but its influences go both broader and deeper than simple genre revivalism. At its core, the album draws energy from the intense emotionality trumpeted in the music of artists like Body High associate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28501-shlohmo/"">Shlohmo</a>. Jerome LOL, both with the defunct <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30497-lol-boys/"">LOL Boys</a> and in his own solo work, has long shown the ability to mine authentic emotion from what might otherwise seem a particularly cerebral form of dance music. Samo has similarly tempered his technical finesse with wounded samples that elevate his projects beyond your casual beat-happy wonkery. Together, the two wed their technical expertise to produce an album that’s far more trickier to pull off than it sounds: through the majority of the churning, frantic <i>Friend of Mine</i>, they maintain a sense of near-constant climax.</p>
<p>The need to reach that peak and stay there, and the previously mentioned words that form the album’s mantra, originate on the thumping “Love Songs”, which repeats those eight words endlessly without losing momentum. It’s a difficult feat to pull off, and the duo accomplish it by adjusting almost every other element in the song—pulling a gun-patter drumbeat in and out of the mix, shifting the volume and clarity of the sample, and playing with countless other minor beat variations that keep things fresh for the entirety of the track’s running time.</p>
<p>“Love Songs” is the best song on the record and a blueprint for the rest of it, as its perennial high and repetitive vocal loop are echoed on the majority of <i>Friend of Mine’s </i>ten tracks. This maximalism is maintained by clever sequencing; though the repetitive vocal sample on “One Who Lost” could prove numbing in the wake of ""Love Songs"", it’s quick and effective in its delivery. But even the seemingly lighter songs here reach an eventual fever pitch. The album's exception to that rule is the organ-powered “Sit Down Satan”, which reaches for a more explicit type of ecstasy and is perfectly positioned to stoke momentum for the album’s final flourishes.</p>
<p>DJ Dodger Stadium’s sound counters assertions of superficiality in current-day dance music by doubling down on the human element within their music. Some of that humanity is owed to the record’s firm sense of place. Los Angeles is inescapable here: on the carnival sounds and Salvadoran sermon incorporated into “The Dust”, the Hollywood-style intro “The Bottom is As Low as You Can Go”, and in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi11LVYL8g4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the video for “Love Songs,”</a> which used an aerial drone to capture a one-shot take of the duo’s Westlake neighborhood<i>.</i> With its happy contradictions—theatricality and genuine emotion, self-consciousness and self-awareness—<i>Friend of Mine </i>functions as a symbol of the neurotic, nocturnal Angeleno, happily alone upon the highways or anonymous on the city’s dance floors, free to lament and to celebrate existence.</p></div>"|19562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19562-dj-dodger-stadium-friend-of-mine/|8.0|Jonah Bromwich

Cribbing their name from a popular, long-running <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qlvb"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BBC radio show</a> focused on women’s issues and interests, the band worked intensely with producer Tom Murray on honing their aesthetic—clean lines, no color, arty pretensions—synthesizing much of the last half-decade’s developments in dreamy, simply melodic pop music. Many of the band’s readily identifiable influences are fellow Brits: the grayscale glamour of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"">Bat for Lashes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware"">Jessie Ware</a>’s cool, mannered tone, and the minimal romanticism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx"">the xx</a> all snake their way through <i>Conversations</i>, Woman’s Hour’s debut. The results are erudite, slim dream-pop, made distinct in its best moments by an open-hearted sweetness and innocence. </p>
<div>The purest expression of Woman's Hour sound is <i>Conversations</i>’ title track, a song that revels in bookish charm and a yearning, endearing performance from lead singer Fiona Burgess. Burgess sings about “awkward moments of strange affection,” exactly the sort of moments this music could ably soundtrack; the subject matter and sound lends itself well to library-set fantasies, with romantic pairs whispering through stacks of books. There’s a tightness to the band’s ensemble that enables the cultivation of a careful, genuine intimacy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"">Beach House</a> hangs over much of <i>Conversations</i>, from Burgess’s vocal tone to the clear, luminous sound of the album’s arrangement. The slowly blooming keyboard that cracks open ""Our Love Has No Rhythm"" is instantly reminiscent of songs like ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFxdDE0k1_Q&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gila</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNQ97P0rQk8&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heart of Chambers</a>"". Beyond issues with overfamiliarity, much of <i>Conversations</i> falls victim to a lack of consistency and individuality. The band has no trouble putting together pleasant melodies, but those melodies more often than not scan as ephemeral.</div>

<div>Woman's Hour's readily identifiable influences also prove a hindrance; for new groups, being tagged as formulaic isn't necessarily a bad thing, but truly great bands transcend that label by carving out a niche for themselves. Woman's Hour's formula helps listeners find their footing, but it also makes it more difficult for the band to establish their own voice. The best songs on <i>Conversations </i>point to a viable middle ground where earnest delicacy and shadowy tones co-exist, but the band has yet to fully explore that realm.</div></div>"|19544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19544-womans-hour-conversations/|6.3|Jamieson Cox

Eustis started using the name <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/sons-of-magdalene"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sons of Magdalene</a> in 2007 after his father contracted cancer, then recorded some of the record's songs not long before his musical partner Charlie Cooper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/34482-rip-telefon-tel-avivs-charlie-cooper/"">died suddenly in 2009</a>. Eustis finished the album in 2010 and put it on the shelf until now. Perhaps unfairly, this backstory sets up expectations for a certain kind of record—an emotionally bared and demonstratively tormented one where the artist emerges transfigured by grief.</p>
<p>But while listening to the music featured on <i>Move to Pain</i> without context, you'd never guess at the circumstances surrounding its conception, as it sublimates misfortune into distantly sad wisps of retro electro-pop and church-stern interludes. Created while Eustis was learning to work without his longtime partner, <i>Move to Pain</i> sounds understandably tentative and cautious; taking his former band's sound to unaccustomedly poppy places, it's agreeable but innocuous. Dreamy dance-pop, driving atmospheric ligature, and threads of sinuously clipped IDM, with 808-style claps and blocky arp bass slathered everywhere, are all blended into one simple, unassuming consistency.      </p>
<p>Telefon Tel Aviv traded in chill, jazzy electronic music with lots of samples, glitches, clicks, and cuts. At best, they cobbled tough, supple rhythms and fine, gummy tones into shuddering structures that felt bulky but delicately detailed—sonic objects you could feel in your ribcage as well as abstractly admire. At worst, they could be numbingly polite, like something sleek but ignorable you’d half-hear in a coffee shop, and the featured vocals often sounded dreary. Those inconsistencies also hold true for Sons of Magdalene; the best tracks balance the formidable and the fragile, making sub-bass fluctuations and slanted sequences feel blown up under a microscope. ""Crows on the Eaves of My Father's House"" is a particularly compelling look, with gulping vocal cut-ups that recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14306-numb/"">Andy Stott's ""Numb""</a>. But that close focus slips on the more traditional songs, which range from functional but unimaginative to almost rote.</p>
<p>As a singer, Eustis gets the job done without frills, but he seems hesitant about letting us hear his voice and lyrics. He claims the foreground in opening track ""Hold On Hold Still for a Second"", maneuvering a pretty, watery melody through a rubbery sheath of thrumming arps, drilling claps, and plunging synth toms. He scores his most mobile and charismatic vocal performance on ""A Strange Sound"", a sea breeze of electro-pop (rendered just slightly strange by the skippy pitches in the harmonies) that builds to a rewarding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"">Panda Bear</a>-like conclusion. Less successful is his stab at a louche electro style on the haunted dub of ""The Whip"", which lands somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/249-matthew-dear/"">Matthew Dear</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4277-trans-am/"">Trans Am</a>. But more often, we can barely hear him, as on his timid dance-diva take on the title track or his shy coloring of the oily bass music braid ""O Death"".</p>
<p><i>Move to Pain</i> is most noticably held back by its rudimentary tones and structures, which are surprising from someone who's proven capable at cultivating complexity and detail. The songs either crescendo like opening funnels or orbit through sequenced arpeggios, contrasting counterpoint and drifting harmonies with dead-predictable dynamics. In either case, they feel overly straight and preordained, not taking us very far from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The music is simple, but not enough to be sublime; it's active, but not enough to find transcendence. And it doesn't render commonplace technology personal and alive—there's not much here that a savvy amateur couldn't do with GarageBand, a low bar to clear when grid-based composition with soft synths is so accessible. The results that <i>Move to Pain </i>yields are pleasantly neutral, with nothing going spectacularly right or wrong.</p></div>"|19560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19560-sons-of-magdalene-move-to-pain/|6.0|Brian Howe

That wasn’t a particularly good album, and the tour wasn’t particularly impressive either–he’d occasionally leave the stage and return in a new shirt, which struck me as combining the pretension of Ziggy Stardust-esque multiple costume changes with a low-budget shabbiness. But few of the hundreds of devotees who showed up seemed to care. The two most rapt audience members were a pair of highly done-up goth boys who were jammed against the center of the stage. Murphy noticed their laser-like focus on his performance, and part way through his set he took a towel he’d just used to wipe sweat off his head and draped it gently over the face of one of the boys. He spent the rest of the show cradling the towel against his chest, in the embrace of his partner–a goth boy wrapped around a goth boy wrapped around Peter Murphy’s sweaty towel. I’ve rarely seen anyone as totally transported by a concert experience since then.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Those are the kind of fans that have sustained Murphy’s career during the occasional periods where his fairweather fans lose interest. The latest stretch has been taking place since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/307-bauhaus/"">Bauhaus</a>’ unexpectedly triumphant 2005 reunion fell apart two years later. Now would be a good time for those more capricious fans to get back on board, as Murphy's new solo LP, <i>Lion</i> is one of the best he’s ever released.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Aside from the Bauhaus reunion, Murphy’s spent most of the new millennium working in various shades of esoterica; he recorded an album of electronics-enhanced Turkish folk music, a set of classic rock covers, and a couple of efforts that resurrected the more delicate, acoustically-flavored sounds that defined his early solo albums like <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Peter-Murphy-Deep/release/883170"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Deep</i></a> and <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Peter-Murphy-Holy-Smoke/master/4677"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Holy Smoke</i></a>. <i>Lion</i> picks up where Bauhaus’ gleefully abrasive 2008 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11333-go-away-white/""><i>Go Away White</i></a> left off. Working with producer Martin Glover, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9905-youth/"">Youth</a>, he’s completed that previous album’s mission to bring industrial-tinged gothic dance-punk into the present.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Lion</i> opens well into the red with “Hang Up”, a super-dense fusion of rolling, slow-motion arena rock drums, swarm-of-bees synthesizers, and Murphy’s unsettlingly intense vocals, which have a frantic energy and the raw timbre of someone who’s been pushing his larynx to extremes for the past few decades. Between Murphy’s ragged howl and Glover’s typically noisy electronic production it sounds something like what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a> might be making now if he’d never abandoned pop structures. The album doesn’t let up from there: “I Am My Own Name” throws sheets of guitar noise over a darkly throbbing dance beat, with Murphy taking the same death-disco diva role he played on classics like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKRJfIPiJGY&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bela Lugosi’s Dead</a>”. “Low Tar Stars” finds him emulating <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">Bowie</a> for the umpteenth time in his career, only this time it draws from his quasi-industrial, collaborating-with-Trent-Reznor period in the '90s.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Glover’s recent work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"">Paul McCartney</a> was evidence of the producer's unique ability to locate the pent-up energy lurking inside an artist who’s reached a point in his career where he could comfortably, justifiably, coast, and on <i>Lion</i> he does the same with Murphy, who doesn’t just sound energized, but electrified, too. Peter Murphy’s once again located the razor-thin line between restraint and complete unhingedness that he hasn’t walked since Bauhaus’ first time around, and following his recent exploits has never felt more rewarding.</p></div>"|19476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19476-peter-murphy-lion/|7.5|Miles Raymer

So we did our best to change them."" That's Morrissey, on how clueless gatekeepers blocked the Smiths' ""How Soon Is Now?"" from bigger commercial success, in the new book <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/mad-world-new-wave-oral-history-excerpt-the-smiths-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Mad World: An Oral History of New Wave Artists and Songs That Defined the 1980s</i></a>. His comments here are striking partly for how little has changed—in Morrissey's telling, everyone <i>else</i> was wrong: the other Smiths, who were ""embarrassed"" by the lyrics; producer John Porter, who downplayed them; Rough Trade head Geoff Travis, who relegated the song to a UK B-side; and the American chartkeepers and TV producers, who failed to recognize the track's genius. Morrissey's remarks also stand out, though, for their optimism. All his hope might've been gone, as he sang, but he still left a scrap for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Though <i>World Peace Is None of Your Business</i>, Morrissey's first album in five years, comes in times that are undoubtedly just as dumb in their own way, the Smiths' place within them is secure. Defunct for almost three decades, the band is a perennial subject of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48040-echo-chamber-morrissey-says-coachella-offered-to-go-vegetarian-for-the-smiths/"">Coachella reunion whispers</a>. Morrissey elicits tributes in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCU89_kawDA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Parks and Recreation"" dialogue</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52563-morrissey-did-not-ask-to-take-down-the-peanutssmiths-tumblr/""><i>Peanuts</i>-themed Tumblr mashups</a> alike. The gap between albums is his longest since virtually disappearing between 1997's misunderstood <i>Maladjusted</i> and 2004's tommy gun-blazing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5437-you-are-the-quarry/""><i>You Are the Quarry</i></a>, but nowadays Morrissey is rarely far from the public eye, whether publishing a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/150-morrissey-autobiography/"">sometimes-brilliant memoir</a>, canceling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55534-morrissey-cancels-the-remainder-of-us-tour/"">tour dates</a> (while <a href=""http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_140610_01"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blaming the opener</a>), or getting into it over animal rights with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49727-morrissey-slams-jimmy-kimmel-accuses-him-of-making-fun-of-gun-control-depression-obesity/"">Jimmy Kimmel</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49755-staples-center-wasnt-100-vegetarian-for-last-nights-morrissey-concert/"">Los Angeles' Staples Center</a>. Remember when he appeared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55201-morrissey-joins-twitter/"">start using Twitter</a>? Then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55232-morrissey-denies-that-hes-on-twitter/"">denied using Twitter</a>? Post-financial crisis, he's as ubiquitous as global protest movements.</p>
<p>Tour and Twitter drama aside, the rollout of <i>World Peace</i> has still managed only to raise Morrissey's profile, from the album's priceless album cover and tracklist to unconventional spoken-word videos guest-starring past <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_Me_Kiss_You"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">musical collaborator</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55173-morrissey-shares-nancy-sinatra-featuring-video-for-world-peace-is-none-of-your-business/"">Nancy Sinatra</a> and fellow <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55392-morrissey-hangs-with-pamela-anderson-in-earth-is-the-loneliest-planet-spoken-word-video/"">PETA activist Pamela Anderson</a>. The full-length itself, though—in a characteristic Morrissey twist—is hardly welcoming to newcomers. It's musically as rich and worldly as Morrissey gets, and the 55-year-old who early last year addressed another round of health concerns by <a href=""http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_130131_01"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">quipping</a> that ""the reports of my death have been greatly understated"" proves he can be as hilarious and multi-dimensional as ever. But it's also a deeply sour record, even for Morrissey. He's always had it both ways, singing his life but with a wink that resists literal interpretations; even so, this album's expressions of wide-ranging contempt are at times unbecomingly convincing.</p>
<p>Ever since <i>You Are the Quarry</i> weathered criticism for Jerry Finn's unsubtle production, Morrissey's albums have flourished sonically, and that growth is its furthest-reaching to date on <i>World Peace</i>. Boz Boorer, on guitar since 1992's <i>Your Arsenal</i>, brings a muscular continuity and sense of comfort—but keyboard/synthesizer newcomer Gustavo Manzur and producer Joe Chiccarelli (the White Stripes, Beck) go beyond the Ennio Morricone orchestral cameo from 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5439-ringleader-of-the-tormentors/"" target=""_blank"">Ringleader of the Tormentors</a></i> and the unpredictable luxuriance of 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12640-years-of-refusal/"" target=""_blank"">Years of Refusal</a></i>. Recorded in France, the album makes the world its business, encompassing meditative drones along with flamenco guitars and mariachi horns. It's as meticulously detailed as it is cosmopolitan, and marks the second straight Morrissey album that rewards listening without paying attention to the lyrics.</p>
<p>Morrissey's golden vibrato also sounds gloriously undamaged by his recent medical woes. As ever, it's most evident in his nonverbal tics—the way he stretches out the word ""ways"" into umpteen syllables on ""Staircase at the University"", an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoo9Vu1a9bU&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ask""</a>-jaunty number about a student whose academic imperfections lead to suicide, and how he melismatically unfurls ""cries"" on ""The Bullfighter Dies"", another cheerfully morbid song cheering the perfectly Morrissey-esque subject of the title (""because we all want the bull to survive""). ""Neal Cassady Drops Dead"" is as jagged and punchy as its bleakly funny, faux-Beat tirade about ""babies full of rabies/ Rabies full of scabies/ Scarlett has a fever.../ The little fella has got Rubella."" Morrissey still knows how to be cranky with aplomb.</p>
<p>Still, at times the intricate arrangements come across as a means of covering up unmemorable songwriting. The murky midtempo rock of ""Istanbul"", about a father who identifies the body of his dead son, and the ornately textured strummer ""Mountjoy"", which finds grim equality in a notorious Irish prison (""We all lose/ Rich or poor""), are evidence of how these songs often tend to drag. The worst offender is nearly eight-minute centerpiece ""I'm Not a Man"", which grows from ambient twinkles and show-tunes crooning to gutsy modern-rock pounding and howling as Morrissey reaches new levels of self-righteousness: ""I'd never kill or eat an animal/ And I never would destroy this planet I am on."" All credit to Morrissey for speaking inconvenient truths, but it doesn't take joining the Koch family to possess the ability to walk out of this lecture. Forget ""man""—what about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRP3LRcUFg&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""charming""</a>?</p>
<p>Along with the occasional trudging bits, Morrissey's smug preachiness is the album's other off-putting point. The title track is ingeniously catchy and deeply sardonic, but dismissing protesters from Ukraine to Bahrain as ""you poor little fool"" and coining the mantra that ""Each time you vote/ You support the process"" isn't a dose of welcome realism; it's cynical and self-absorbed (Americans in Morrissey's lifetime <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_to_Montgomery_marches"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">marched and died</a> for voting rights). The glamorous, self-mythologizing romantic melancholy that's Morrissey's stock-in-trade, meanwhile, comes up only rarely, though you can hear its echoes in the joyously ""Besame Mucho""-flipping ""Kiss Me a Lot,"" and Morrissey's exaltation of ruffians in the vaguely sexualized violence of ""Smiler With Knife"". The album's most <i>miserablist</i> songs, to use the word long applied to Morrissey's music, nevertheless zoom out for a wider view: there's the Spanish-tinged romp ""Earth Is the Loneliest Planet"", where ""You fail as a woman/ And you lose as a man,"" and the pointedly dirge-like ""Kick the Bride Down the Aisle"", where Morrissey's scorn for institution of matrimony leaves me longing for the Hidden Cameras' more entertaining <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-2lQ_xzQfE&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ban Marriage""</a>. </p>
<p>On finale ""Oboe Concerto"", which idiosyncratically leans on Boorer's sax and clarinet, Morrissey repeats, ""There's a song I can't stand/ And it's stuck in my head."" Beneath electronic blips and burbles, the lurching bass line is reminiscent of the Smiths' 1987 song ""Death of a Disco Dancer"". There, he familiarily sings: ""If you think peace is a common goal/ That goes to show how little you know,"" adding, ""Love, peace, and harmony / Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice / But maybe in the next world."" Or, as he intones now, ""Round, round, rhythm of life goes round."" Morrissey, a wag might say, is none of our business.</p></div>"|19603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19603-morrissey-world-peace-is-none-of-your-business/|5.9|Marc Hogan

<p>For a recent series of sold-out shows in Europe and New York City, J and T have dilated to a seven-person live band that features some chops and muscle, but at the root of their 12-track self-titled debut for <a href=""http://www.xlrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">XL</a>, Jungle retains the constricts of the original duo of producers Josh Lloyd-Watson and Tom McFarland. Throughout their first album, they favor the bantamweight soul reminiscent of early '80s British acts like <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/12688-Imagination"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Imagination</a>, <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/12341-Fun-Boy-Three"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fun Boy Three</a>, <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/27506-I-Level"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I-Level</a> and <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/4711-Fine-Young-Cannibals"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fine Young Cannibals</a>, to name but a few. But it’s the group’s sense of simple, dance-focused visuals  that have attained a certain level of buzz. Peel back those effective visuals and their sonic palette is rather confectionary: pliant bass, simple 4/4 beats, spindling guitar. Sometimes the synths that underpin the tracks are frothy, other times airy, in a few instances bubbly, but they are almost impossible to differentiate from track to track. The synthesized horns and eddying synth washes of “Busy Earnin’” are a nice garland for a track that laments the self-centeredness of being “Too busy earning/ Can’t get enough.”</p>
<p>Too often, Jungle’s shimmering surfaces belie the flimsiness of the songs themselves, which buckle under any sort of weight. Take opener “The Heat”, a catchy, light funk number which manages to shoehorn in three separate “heat” references in under 10 seconds: actual temperature, sexual intensity, and the police (via a sample of wailing sirens). It’s the image of the roller-skating b-boys in matching tracksuits in the song's video, and not the song itself, that leaves a lasting impression.</p>
<p>Digested as individual singles rather than as an entire album in one sitting, Jungle fares far better. “Platoon” remains a standout, as does “Time”, though these songs’ distinguishing features blur due to the indistinguishable tracks that border either side of them. The falsetto-castrato harmonies—<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">just beyond the range of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell</a></span>—that deliver each chorus and hook proves tiring on the ears, too: imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"">TV on the Radio</a>’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDzTjyiRVAM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Was a Lover</a>” with Tunde Adebimpe and Kyp Malone forever in the purgatory of that high, grating register, never to descend back into a growl or tenor, much less their regular singing voice. With an expanded band, one hopes that Jungle might broaden their template and branch out into different timbres. As it stands, remaining at that upper register with every word and line, the album’s 39 minutes feel much longer, leaving one high and dry.</p></div>"|19600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19600-jungle-jungle/|6.2|Andy Beta

Their debut, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13975-yeah-so/""><i>Yeah So</i></a>, was a collection of peppy, straightforward folk-pop that earned the band comparisons to pairs from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">the White Stripes</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1602-the-fiery-furnaces/"">the Fiery Furnaces</a>; by 2011, they had moved on to a richer, more tonally diverse sound, one captured by their strong sophomore effort <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15823-paradise/""><i>Paradise</i></a>. The band's new record, <i>Complete Surrender</i>, continues their developmental trend: Taylor and Watson have taken a large, proud step into the world of soul.</p>
<p>The transformation is comprehensive: arrangements move and swing, newfound emphasis is placed on rhythm, blooming horn sections hold court, and Taylor taps into a reservation of emotion and sheer vocal power that was kept hidden on the band's earlier records. But even as Slow Club moves from sound to sound with each new full-length, the core of their appeal—their unique relationship and vocal interplay—remains uncompromised. Taylor and Watson spend a lot of time singing about love and how it's won and lost, but they shy away from playing a couple or suggesting some unresolved romantic drama. Instead, they usually end up sounding like two old friends who share a powerful, purely platonic love, and have spent years singing together and for each other. That interpretation of their dynamic is complemented by their vocal strategy: they frequently sing in unison, eschewing harmony save for situations where special emphasis is required. </p>
<div><i>Complete Surrender </i>preserves this core strength and doubles down on a few others, giving Slow Club a solid base from which they play with genre and density. The album was produced by veteran Colin Elliot, who has a good ear for space dynamics whether the arrangements are jam-packed (on rompers like ""Suffering You, Suffering Me"" and ""The Queen's Nose"") or sparse (the stunning piano-led ballad ""Number One""). Elliot understands that Taylor and Watson's voices are the keys to unlocking the band's songs, and he highlights them accordingly, making sure they remain at the forefront no matter how much action is taking place in the background.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Taylor, continuing a pattern of improvement that began with <i>Paradise</i>, is an absolute titan of a lead vocalist. Her voice is big, bright, and open, with a complete lack of pretension. She's an expert at conveying a wide range of emotion, which renders her an instantly familiar presence; when she cuts loose on a dusty, grand ballad like ""The Queen's Nose,"" it's like having your face unexpectedly melted by a neighbor or co-worker at a local open mic. Given that she spends much of <i>Complete Surrender </i>singing about complex relationships and different strains of heartbreak, it's a valuable quality, as she has no trouble connecting with the listener. Watson is a good singer in his own right, too—he carries the aforementioned ""Number One"" with surprising tenderness—but he's best when serving as Taylor's backup or enthusiastic foil.</div>
<div></div>
<div>An important contributor to <i>Complete Surrender</i>'s success is the reverence and respect with which Taylor and Watson approach the material. They're not the first group to evoke the spirit of Northern soul, but they understand that the genre deserves more than a few bleating horns. Their strong sense of identity helps, too: it's clear that the duo have a good handle on their strengths, and even their less successful experiments or compositions can fall back on a base level of chemistry and comfort. Listening to <i>Complete Surrender</i>, you get the sense that Taylor and Watson would be just as happy making music for, and with, each other in their spare time, revelling in their companionship.</div></div>"|19553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19553-slow-club-complete-surrender/|7.6|Jamieson Cox

After a few years of bouncing around Los Angeles’ burgeoning electronic music scene—an exploratory period that included the founding of his initially cassette-focused label <a href=""http://leavingrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leaving</a>—he caught the discerning ear of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>, who signed McQueen to his own <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> imprint. His proper debut LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15334-outmind/""><i>Outmind</i></a><i>,</i> was released in 2011, which, depending on how you look at it, was either a very fertile or very tough period for bedroom producers who drew influence from hip-hop. At that time, musicians of questionable talent emerged constantly in this sphere, and many of them directly ripped off FlyLo’s sidechained, fusion-focused sound. McQueen's aesthetic bore a clear debt to his label head, but <i>Outmind</i> stood apart from the pack, a static-riddled document that infused its more straightforward moments with dense thickets of obscured noise.</p>
<p>McQueen’s latest full-length, <i>In My World</i>, could be considered <i>Outmind</i>’s proper follow-up after a few low-profile releases, but the album represents a move away from earlier style. The shift is immediately apparent in the opening title track, which pairs a decaying AM-radio sample with a pulsing rhythmic framework and, most notably, McQueen’s voice. “In my world, it’s paradise for you,” he sing-raps, before stating plainly, “Outer space is where I want to know you.”</p>
<p>This latest detour could owe something to significant life events—McQueen recently married and had a child—and <i>In My World</i> certainly seems more personal than his previous work. Regardless, his choice to sing, rap, and sing-rap throughout <i>In My World</i> is obviously risky; his vocals tend to distract from what surrounds them, and his skill on the mic is, at best, rudimentary. McQueen’s turn here brings to mind fellow West Coast hip-hop-influenced oddball <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5788-james-pants/"">James Pants</a>, another polyglot artist who had a brief moment of increased visibility earlier this decade; at times, <i>In My World</i>’s fixation on R&amp;B-abused frameworks and dub-influenced sonics comes across as similarly dated. </p>
<p><i>In My World</i>’s back half briefly ditches McQueen’s voice and is more engaging for it—”West Coast Jungle Juke”, in particular, heads back to <i>Outmind</i>’s foggy swarm before quietly erupting in an ‘ardcore break near its end. And when he takes the mic again on the closing cut “Birds in Flight” it’s his strongest vocal on the album: he simmers and whines over a bed of rainforest sonics and distant flute, a soothing and somewhat affecting creation reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/?"">Animal Collective </a>member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4174-avey-tare/"">Avey Tare</a>’s solo work. Even at its best, though, <i>In My World</i> resembles a less-engaging version of someone else, the sound of an artist regressing instead of stepping forward into new territory.</p></div>"|19488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19488-matthewdavid-in-my-world/|5.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

White, of course, had already been kicking around the garage-rock scene for years— but nowhere near as long as Cartwright, whose résumé stretches back to the ’80s, although he made his first mark with the Memphis band <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/485145-Compulsive-Gamblers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Compulsive Gamblers</a> in the early ’90s. His subsequent group, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31293-the-oblivians/"">Oblivians</a>, became his best known, and for good reason: Like a chunk of bloody meat chucked into a carburetor, Oblivians was a wonderful mess of primitive R&amp;B and punk. But even under all that gunk, one thing was clear: Cartwright was a man who knew how to craft songs and coax melodies. Reigning Sound became the vessel for broadening ability, to the point where their 2009 album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13297-love-and-curses/"">Love and Curses</a></i>, owed as much to early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"">Elvis Costello</a> as to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/853-the-cramps/"">the Cramps</a>. On <i>Shattered</i>, Reigning Sound’s first album since 2009 and first for <a href=""http://www.mergerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Merge</a>, Cartwright has dialed down the fuzz— and cranked up the songcraft— even more.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p>There aren’t many new elements to <i>Shattered</i> as compared to earlier Reigning Sound releases, but it marks a decided shift in how those elements are employed. Recorded in <a href=""http://daptonerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daptone</a>’s studio in Brooklyn rather than on Cartwright’s home turf of Memphis, and with a relatively new roster, the album is loose, flowing, and at times downright funky. Ironically, it sounds more like a vintage, <a href=""http://www.staxrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stax</a>-era production than anything Reigning Sound ever did back home. “Baby, It’s Too Late” smothers itself in earthy organ, ventilated by stinging, <a href=""http://playitsteve.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Cropper</a>-esque licks. “North Cackalacky Girl” is a mod-R&amp;B rave-up with only a tinge of punk ruggedness. For a band that titled its 2004 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6922-too-much-guitar/"">Too Much Guitar</a></i>, there’s a noticeable subjugation of that instrument; Cartwright’s riffs are cleaner, sharper, and more sparingly applied, and they punch harder thanks to that tasteful dynamic.</p>
<p>The fluidity and lyricism in Cartwright’s playing has always been hinted at in Reigning Sound but never fully explored. The same goes for his voice, a husky, charismatic bellow that’s able to dip into a supple, soulful croon. His full range is stretched into thrilling places, though, on <i>Shattered</i>’s handful of roots-rock tracks, some of which solidly straddle the country-soul divide. “Never Coming Home” and “Once More” sport mournful strings, lonely spaces, and the kind of choked-up twang that can overcome even the tritest of lyrics—one of the few major drawbacks of the album. A shining exception is <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mergerecords/falling-rain"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Falling Rain”</a>, the record’s dizzying apex. Approaching Dylan-and-the-Band chemistry, Cartwright and his current lineup pull together every thread that’s unspooled throughout the album; meanwhile, their leader’s lyrics take homespun, borderline mundane sentiments about the sadness of loss and call forth an inspired, gut-deep pathos that transcends the ostensibly basic blocks it’s built from.</p>
<p>“Starting New” is one of <i>Shattered</i>’s subtlest songs, but also one of its most telling. Introspective and impressionistic, Cartwright rhapsodizes and pitches woo with all the caressed, tender phrasing of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdaNz5APlh4&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“T.B. Sheets”</a>-era Van Morrison. The funk is subliminal; the country comes from nowhere and everywhere. Like an attempt at unified field theory of American music, the song is a leap forward for Reigning Sound, one of many on <i>Shattered</i>. Cartwright’s contemporary, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"">Jack White</a>, may be probing the outer limits of his own domain with his new album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19420-jack-white-lazaretto/"">Lazaretto</a></i>. But in a humbler, warmer, more openhearted way, Reigning Sound have risen above themselves—as well as the garage-rock idiom that spawned them— while spiritually hewing true.</p></div>"|19503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19503-reigning-sound-shattered/|7.7|Jason Heller

Above all else, the name: he’d left his “ratchet sex hero” cape in the phone booth this round, temporarily abandoning “The-Dream” moniker for his real name, Terius Nash. It made sense; though he’s spent his solo career forging a path perpendicular to the machinations of popular R&amp;B, Nash has always been strategic, if not cautious, with regard to his audience’s demands, balancing his restless compositional impulses with a mercenary’s knack for instantly catchy melodies. <i>1977</i> was a gamble, its rawness a potentially jarring departure from the orgasmic excess of his first three albums that often gestured towards vulnerability but never quite went all in.</p>
<p>There are no such cautionary measures in place for <i>Royalty: The Prequel</i>, the seven-track EP he released for free download, as The-Dream, one day after announcing its existence and a handful of days after his third wedding. In part, it’s because he’s got no one to answer to but himself these days; <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2014/01/the-dream-splits-with-def-jam"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he left Def Jam in January</a>, and is currently helming <a href=""http://www.contra-paris.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Contra Paris</a>, a “designer and culture label” along with longtime partner <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricky_Stewart"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tricky Stewart</a>. But though the EP’s a closer descendent of <i>1977</i>, in form and content, chronologically it follows <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18053-the-dream-fourplay/""><i>IV Play</i></a>, Nash’s fourth and worst-received studio album. <i>IV Play</i> wasn’t a failure, but by Nash’s standards, it was unprecedentedly un-great; its first half in particular felt desperate to prove a point—somewhere in between “I can still hang with the kids” and “the kids aren’t all that great anyway”—that, if not totally inaccurate, wasn’t particularly inviting. But with <i>Royalty</i>, removed from the demands and delays of a major label and rebounding from the harshest criticism of his solo career, Nash finally has nothing to prove, resulting in some of his most honest work yet.</p>
<p>Nash’s lyrics and love life have a history of being inextricably braided together, but—aside from <i>1977</i>—never more transparently than here. His stubborn belief in the unflinching realism of R&amp;B at its best, combined with a compulsive, truth-serum narcissism (when he’s writing for others, he fully becomes them, but on his own, he’s himself to an arguable fault) has always been the quality that’s made his music so piercingly relatable. There were moments of vulnerability on his first three albums, but they tended to shift focus to derail true self-reflection: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Hate_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Love Hate</i></a>’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlb-XoHJ_a8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nikki</a>” replaced the unsolved tension of then with the instant gratification of now; the two-part title track of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_vs._Money"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Love vs. Money</i></a> skimmed the surface of his skewed priorities that ended a relationship, then quickly devolved into petty blame games. As Nash has grown more willing to face the potentially gnarly complexities of love and loss head-on, though, a funny thing has happened: the separation between his love life and his career has whittled away, to the point where it’s often hard to tell which he’s actually addressing. It’s a diehard music nerd’s way of navigating life: as he draws parallels between himself and the music he loves, each makes a little more sense.</p>
<p><i>Royalty</i> blurs these lines more than any of Nash’s earlier projects, tilting potentially straightforward ballads into thinly veiled pop music criticism. (<i>1977</i>’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K7ECwHM-vs&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghetto</a>” set the precedent—“She want that old thing back, that ride it like a pony” doubled as a remembrance of fucks past, and an R&amp;B classicist’s nostalgia for an era where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29157-ginuwine/"">Ginuwine</a>’s no-punches-pulled raunch ruled the charts; <i>IV Play</i>’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPwkzdYN4JE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Slow It Down</a>” made the ambiguity between lover and audience more explicit than ever, not to mention complained outright at the current state of radio R&amp;B— “Always with you baby, I’d never sell out/ Them other niggas had to do a dance record or the label wouldn’t put ‘em out.”) Nash makes this duality immediately clear on opening track “Duet”, its punny hook a tongue-wagging sex-as-music metaphor. It’s most poignant on “Lake Michigan”, on which he simultaneously eulogizes the naive intensity of first love, and grasps in vain for a long-gone time when he could create art for its own sake. And on “Cold”, a continuation of the shots fired on <i>1977</i>’s super-salty “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDwhxhOBdBE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Form Of Flattery</a>,” a lover listening to his R&amp;B peers in front of him is an unforgivable act of infidelity.</p>
<p>True to form, new songs are in constant conversation with echoes of past work. “Culture”, with its wispy new-money elegance, serves as a sequel of sorts to fan favorite “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFhqeHkdHgU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fancy</a>”, updated with a brisk reality check. The Fendi shoes and Bentley coupes remain, but it’s complicated—now, Nash blatantly ogles the French restaurant waitresses and gets loaded off Patron while his date sips Riesling. And on standout track “Wedding Bells,” a deceptively buoyant response to <i>1977</i>’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P63aYbXjN24"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wedding Crasher</a>”, Nash shifts from inebriated interloper to inebriated groom. In both scenarios, he’s not as happy in the moment as he might have expected, but the spiteful scowl of <i>1977</i> and the try-hard smirk of <i>IV Play</i> are replaced by what feels like sincere, if jaded, acceptance, at least for the moment.</p>
<p>There are no features here, no elaborate interludes, and none of the cheeky ayy!s and ella!s that punctuated his previous records. Where Nash plays here is in the intertextuality between his real life and his lyrics, between his new and old works, and between himself and his influences. <i>IV Play</i>’s rap verses felt awkward, shoe-horned in for credibility; on <i>Royalty</i>, he weaves his rap touchstones into his narratives instead. The faded memories of first love are made crisper by remembering the first time hearing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik</i></a> on “Outkast”, and a sample of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep/"">Mobb Deep</a>’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NUX4tW5pps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shook Ones Pt. 2</a>” drives home the message on “Cold” (if naming seven of his peers outright wasn’t direct enough). If <i>1977</i> was Nash’s lesson in vulnerability disguised as a break-up album, and <i>IV Play</i> a semi-rhetorical question about his place in contemporary R&amp;B, <i>Royalty</i> isn’t so much a tribute to new love but—left to his own devices at last—a complicated love letter to music itself.</p></div>"|19634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19634-the-dream-royalty-the-prequel-ep/|7.1|Meaghan Garvey

Though <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29241-hodgy-beats/"" target=""_blank"">Hodgy Beats</a> has long been a competent technical rapper, his performance on </span><i>Insa,</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> the recent release from his Mellowhype partnership with producer Left Brain, shows him to have made major improvements since the last time we heard from him (on the smoked-out </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18708-mellowhigh-mellowhigh/"" target=""_blank""><i>MellowHigh</i></a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">). The way he skates over his verses, threatening to spin recklessly out of control while never doing so, vaults him into the ranks of other top-rate OF rhymers—I’d argue that he’s at least reached the skill level of his old pal, fellow weed-lover and MellowHigh addition, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29181-domo-genesis/"" target=""_blank"">Domo Genesis</a>.</span></p>
<p>Hodgy’s improvement is most obvious on <i>Insa</i>’s more high-energy tracks. The mixtape’s lead single, “Nowadays"", is the best example, with Hodgy dropping whiplash references to ex-Lakers and his eating habits, “pickin the skin off chickens and skipping on grandma dinner rolls.” That’s a line that exemplifies the rappers’ style: while he’s as beholden to the call of internal rhyme as your average <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27670-doom/"" target=""_blank"">DOOM</a> stan, Hodgy’s verses never feel cramped. Instead his bars flow freely downhill, with plenty of momentum to ease the density of his wordplay.  On other standouts, such as record opener “Gang” and the ogre-core stomp of “Fifafofum!”, that free-for-all feeling is reminiscent of the old Odd Future energy, anarchic, chaotic and genuinely exciting.</p>
<p>Mellowhype live up to their portmanteau on the other half of the record; when the hype dies down, the duo lace listeners with a trio of boilerplate “light-one-up” tracks.  The strongest offering of the three is the shortest: on “The Daze"", Left Brain makes the smart choice of looping the collective soft scatting of <a href=""http://friscotsc.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Syd tha Kyd</a> (who has quietly become one of the collective’s most magnetic stars) underneath the verses before unleashing her on the chorus. The result is neo-soul at its finest, Syd’s calming presence providing a proper foil for an agitated Hodgy.</p>
<p>Though Hodgy has undoubtedly improved, he still occasionally struggles to channel his kinetic verses and forceful delivery into compelling songs. Traditionally, on Mellowhype albums, Left Brain has swooped in to save songs where Hodgy falls flat—his production has always been at least as compelling as Hodgy’s verses and the duo’s best songs, from “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRJ4T3j578I&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La Bonita</a>"", to “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9K5KtRr7S0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SmokeSumKushWitme</a>"", have benefitted from his  enigmatic, energetic beats.  On <i>Insa, </i>for whatever reason, he’s pulled back a bit, flirting with boom-bap and quiet storm samples in contrast to his usual bombast and left field choices, and as a result, there’s nothing to redeem Hodgy when he gets caught in a bad loop. So whether it be on the rote gangsterisms of “Belly’s” second verse or the rote misogyny of the concept song “7” (“got a bitch for every day of the week”), Left Brain’s beats here are a little too subdued to entirely rescue the worst of the rappity-rap proceedings.</p>
<p><i>Insa </i>(which stands for “I need some answers”)<i> </i>was released on July 4<sup>th</sup> as a <a href=""http://www.oddfuture.com/collections/music/products/mellowhype-insa"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">free mixtape</a>, and as such, it punches well above its weight, a reminder of just how skilled the broader Odd Future collective is. And yet, like the class clowns they were billed as when they introduced themselves to the world, the group’s potential always seems to loom above their output as a ceiling they haven’t yet cracked—file <i>Insa</i> as another release from the collective that’s a shrug-worthy solid rather than the rap-realigning release that was once predicted for the group. Hodgy Beats and Left Brain are capable of being a top-rate rapper and a top-rate producer respectively, and neither is a kid anymore. Isn’t it past time that they came out with something a little more challenging, or at least more memorable?</p></div>"|19612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19612-mellowhype-insa/|6.6|Jonah Bromwich

<p>The switch from acoustic to electric has a lovely lamplit effect on the songs. The chords and riffs make pleasant, friendly college-rock shapes, like the riff on ""Insignificance"", which feels like a watercolor made out of a <i>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</i> song, or the overdrive on ""Open Road,"" which fizzes like a classic Yo La Tengo drone rocker. The power chords of ""Blonde Boy"", which Kivel barely articulates with the edge of his pick, feels like a Bachman-Turner Overdrive or Cars song creeping through a library on tiptoes.</p>
<p>Kivel seems to be making his muted version of a radio rock record, which is something you can hear in the lyrics as well. On ""Insignificance,"" he whispers fragmented FM rock signifiers—""Black is night/ The highway/ Her nails so red and wild/ Green and slip/ The oceanside""—like Bob Seger via William Carlos Williams. On ""Little Girls,"" he sings ""Honey I ain't got forever/ You take me now or never/ Just step into the night/ There I'll be gone."" On the title track, Kivel quotes the melody of Fine Young Cannibals' ""She Drives Me Crazy"", of all things. As with everything else, it's handled gently, cradled like a robin's egg. No one is actually being wild here per the album title, but the album is full of feeling for the memory of such days, the imprint they leave in the mind.</p>
<p>Kivel's voice is as much a warm shape and the guitars: As on <i>Double Exposure</i>, he's barely intelligible save for isolated phrases. Pieced together, these little snatches of clear communication convey almost as much, in their evocative settings, as the full lyric sheet does. One of them, from ""Only With the Wine,"" is ""She fucks with other guys/ But why?"", and another, from ""End of Adventure,"" is ""Slapped on your ass."" One of the welcome surprises of spending prolonged time with Kivel's music is discovering how quietly libidinous it is. Of course, another clear, ringing lyric piercing the haze is ""I don't wanna die/ But I will."" But compared with <i>Double Exposure'</i>s central confession ""I want to kill myself"" (from ""Whip""), the line feels positively life-affirming. Kivel is still troubled by mortality, but on <i>Days</i> he is pushing away from it, towards life and contact.</p></div>"|19501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19501-matt-kivel-days-of-being-wild/|7.6|Jayson Greene

The two brothers, Florida-raised and currently Brooklyn-based, have released an alarmingly unwieldy pile of music over the past few years. Edwin makes records under the name <a href=""http://eola.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eola</a>, and his last album <i><a href=""http://eola.bandcamp.com/album/ye"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ye</a></i> features elaborate, dramatic choral arrangements where he's the sole vocalist. Andy's records as <a href=""http://andyboay.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andy Boay</a> are psychedelic and unpredictable—he creates cluttered, maximal song structures that can shift suddenly from ethereal to heavy. Together, they're <a href=""http://tonstartssbandht.bandcamp.com/music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tonstartssbandht</a> (pronounced tahn-starts-bandit), an endlessly touring project that's always been eclectic.</p>
<p>For the majority's of the band's lifespan, the two brothers have lived apart—Andy in Montreal, Ed in New York—so their records came together during brief stints of in-person collaboration and, as Andy <a href=""http://www.secretdecoder.net/columns/2013/08/15/studio-apartment-7-andy-white-of-tonstartssbandht-long-distance-paradigm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>, through ""<span>a ton of emailing, megauploading, and mediafiring songs to each other.""</span> The resulting records aren't easily definable by a long shot. ""Our style of music definitely goes all over,"" Edwin <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/tonstartssbandht-discovery/#_"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told <i>Interview</i></a>, and he's right: vocal experiments stilted by tape effects, echoing tracks that are more reminiscent of straightforward rock'n'roll—you could spend the better part of a day cataloging this band's many disparate sounds. But regardless of where you hit play on any of their 24 solo and collective Bandcamp albums, you'll find two talented musicians self-recording an enormous pile of ambitious music.</p>
<p>Still, the best way to experience Tonstartssbandht isn't by clicking around their various releases—it's to hear what the two brothers create in a live setting. In addition to being an accomplished vocalist, Edwin is an incredible drummer. Andy creates an enormous, lush sound with his 12-string Danelectro. As a duo, they go long for stretches of music that's easily described as psychedelic, though nothing's bleary or incomprehensible. Everything they perform seems just slightly hazy and out of reach. They're jammy, but never loose or sloppy, and they can shift suddenly from expansive Tuareg-style guitar odysseys into full-on proto-punk bashing. Their vocals mesh together in this way where at first, it's difficult to parse whether it's two people singing in perfect unison or just an echo effect. Eventually, their voices dart in separate directions, finding harmonies that aren't always intuitive, but work perfectly. Everything is porous and fluid.</p>
<p>That's why <i>Overseas </i>is, perhaps, the best Tonstartssbandht document to date—it's a live album, though it's not done in one live take. Much like how Ed collaged together a series of letters and words to come up with the band's name, the duo strung together multiple performances to build an exceptionally cohesive record. These are recordings culled from shows at Warsaw, Berlin, Paris, Newcastle, and other cities overseas. Clearly, this band thrives in ""collage"" mode, as the album's tracklist is built largely from a steady stream of medleys. They seem to trim songs down to their most essential elements, riding into battle together with an abridged (but no less powerful) rendition of the heavy psych jam ""First Taape"". That howling basher from Andy's old band <a href=""http://sugarboys.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sugar Boys</a> is pared back to two minutes from 17:12. They slowly fade into ""Last Time"", a sparse, echoing interpretation of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rfL0_ORFdw&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Rolling Stones track</a>.</p>
<p>Several times on <i>Overseas</i>, the two brothers meander away from their own melodies and into a song that's long been embedded in their subconscious. Sometimes, they find the perfect spot for boiled down grooves <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq3jPTLZJKo&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">by Amon Düül II</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDewPs86g1w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pharaoh Overlord</a>. Others more closely resemble verses-and-choruses songs, like the Stones cover or their take on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjHjm5sRqSA&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Carter Family's ""Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)""</a>. Impressively, the appropriated material never feels out of place—there's a logic and ease in the way they fold other artists' songs into their own sound. They're sonic chameleons, invoking International Harvester's ""Sov gott Rose-Marie"" with reverence. They interrupt their 2011 track ""Hymn Our Garden"" with a maximum R&amp;B version of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XqyGoE2Q4Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steppenwolf's ""The Pusher""</a>. Andy's proclamation of ""I smoke a lot of grass, <i>oh lord!</i>"" is tonally perfect, howling that phrase and more with the gritty sincerity of his longhair forebears. </p>
<p>With their prolific nature, it would be easy to give Tonstartssbandht bonus points simply because of all the different sounds they can make, but this band and <i>Overseas</i> are special because of how they utilize all the tools at their will. It's a live record, yes, but one with heaps of nuance and ever-shifting studies in texture and tone. They can slather their vocals in echo over minimal instrumentation, or they can shred. There's no guarantee that the two brothers will stay in the same place together for very long, but as long as they keep touring together and producing music this riveting, their proximity matters little.</p></div>"|19575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19575-tonstartssbandht-overseas/|8.0|Evan Minsker

After becoming one of Britain’s brightest young blues pickers and declining an invitation to join the then-fledgling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">Rolling Stones</a> in the early 60s, Cooper made a string of singer-songwriter records for the British label <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pye_Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pye</a>. That relationship both climaxed and closed in 1972, with the release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19483-mike-cooper-trout-steelplaces-i-knowthe-machine-gun-co-with-mike-cooper/"" target=""_blank"">Cooper’s outlandish <i>The Machine Gun Co.</i></a>—the last in a series of three transgressive folk-rock explorations, where blooming free jazz and spiraling psychedelics disrupted any simple, sing-and-strum notions. Cooper lost his record contract and, during the next four decades, let his musical investigation and imagination run amuck. He still played the blues, yes, but he also mined electroacoustic improvisation and Hawaiian music, operatic composition and <a href=""http://www.cooparia.com/discography/new-hipshot-releases"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brion Gysin-like cut-ups.</a> Folk-rock? Nope. Cooper bequeathed that mantle long ago, only for it to be taken up in recent years by the young Gunn and scores of his peers. Once again, they’ve worked to expand the sounds that such a drab term might entail, picking up the antagonism that once made Cooper an outcast.</p>
<p>But late last year, despite the four decades and the ocean that separates them, Cooper and Gunn rendezvoused in a Portugal airport, launching 10 days of shows and a retreat in a Lisbon studio. The partnership came as a commission from <a href=""http://igetrvng.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RVNG Intl.</a>, the New York-based label that has issued a string of similar one-off encounters—<a href=""http://igetrvng.com/shop/frkwys-vol-8-blues-control-laraaji/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blues Control, meet Laraaji</a>; <a href=""http://igetrvng.com/shop/frkwys-live-howarth-grosskopf-emeralds-19-x-25-poster/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds, meet Alan Howarth</a>—as the aptly named <a href=""http://igetrvng.com/shop/category/frkwys-releases/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FRKWYS series</a> during the last five years. The edict was simple: Make some new music, and attempt to sort it into a record.</p>
<p>The seven-song result, <i>Cantos de Lisboa</i>, might feel at first like a grab bag, as the pair moves freely between a number of styles, techniques, and instruments. They’re both best known for their intimate voices and their intricate picking, but they sing very little here and surround their guitars with a host of distractions. While they begin with twin forlorn guitars on opener “Saudade Do Santos-o-Vehlo”, they shift to scraped gongs and scrambled electronics for “Song for Charlie”, or at least most of it. “Pony Blues” showcases two dexterous players, winding through lithe licks with the agility of the Shetlands of which Cooper sings. The focus of “Saramago”, though, is that of <i>outré</i> players, with scraped strings and manipulated notes, ruptured harmonics and dissonant strums suggesting the acoustic improvisations of Derek Bailey and Eugene Chadbourne.</p>
<p>Restless, career-long collaborators on their own, Gunn and Cooper twirl across the electrostatic cello lines of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Espvall"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Helena Espvall</a> during “Pena Panorama”. Gunn sings at the end, offering up a bucolic refrain about perseverance. It’s the closest the album comes to the folk-rock that serves as Cooper and Gunn respective calling card, but that most accessible bit comes bound to four minutes of impish abstraction—fitting symbols for both careers.</p>
<p>Beyond the sonics, though, <i>Cantos de Lisboa</i> isn’t nearly as sporadic or assorted as it might seem. In a brief introductory essay, Cooper notes that he and Gunn attended a concert in a Fado club while in Lisbon. The spirit of that wonderfully sad music pervades and links these numbers. It’s at times obvious; drifting invocation “Saudade Do Santos-o-Vehlo” takes its name from <i>saudade</i>, the emotional essence that bands Fado together. But you can hear that same doubt lingering inside “The Enchanted Moura”, a brief and bristling cut that creeps with uncertainty. Cooper, who lives in Rome, and Gunn, from Philadelphia, seem to offer a multilingual celebration of the blues—not as a musical style, but as a condition bound to the sounds of more than the Mississippi Delta or the Brits who salvaged that music. A feeling holds <i>Cantos de Lisboa </i>together where its music cannot.</p>
<p>Results of forced, paid-for collaborations like those on FRKWYS or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Fishtank"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the dormant In the Fishtank</a> can be spotty, plagued by outside expectations and prevailing legacy. A curator hears something connecting two artists or ensembles on record, but in person, those aspects don’t sync into serendipity to make new music worth hearing. Within both series, examples of ideas that worked on paper and fizzled in person abound. But <i>Cantos</i> feels more like the start of a spark than a sample of a bankrupt idea. Gunn, 37, is an active collaborator, sure, from supporting songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"">Kurt Vile</a> to exploring arid blues <a href=""http://threelobed.bandcamp.com/album/ocean-parkway"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">with drummer John Truscinski.</a> He hasn’t had the time or the space to plunder far-flung genres and idioms the same way Cooper has. Here, the elder feels like the guide, leading an able and adaptive acolyte into moments that extend Gunn’s previous grasp. <i>Cantos</i> makes you want to know how far he will eventually go. There’s nothing quite as wild and discursive in Gunn’s catalogue as “Lampedusa 2013”, for instance, an abrasive philippic that might pass for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/906-current-93/"">Current 93</a>. It’s one of this set’s most surprising and exciting bits, a moment that mostly makes you hope there’s more to come. </p></div>"|19442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19442-steve-gunn-mike-cooper-cantos-de-lisboa/|7.2|Grayson Haver Currin

From the beginning, the music that Nathan and Aaron Weaver made thrived on inherent unease with expectations. On their earliest releases, they repurposed the furor of black metal, reshaping its sprints into half-marathons and adding classical overtones—operatic vocals, instrumental denouements, recurrent themes—to fashion arching, dramatic epics. “Our black metal is the product of our personal and specific history,” they said in <a href=""http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/interviews/238052-wolves-throne-room-black-metal-their-own-terms.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an early, telling interview</a>, “irrespective of other bands that share certain stylistic elements.” They wanted to be anonymous. They wanted to cordon themselves from their closest stylistic peers. They wanted separation.</p>
<p>That distance, in turn, became one of music’s great recent press hooks: Wolves in the Throne Room lived on a farm, not off the grid but wanting to be while growing a wide variety of vegetables and raising livestock. That tale became part of most every Wolves in the Throne Room story—how the band couldn’t wait to leave the road, to return <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-05-15/entertainment/0905130408_1_band-members-satanic-metal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“to living in a rhythmic sort of rural way.”</a> Otherness was the very core of their creation myth. True to form, though, that jig was soon up, too; after the agrarian fable had been recounted countless times and driven more than one album cycle, the band admitted that maybe homesteading wasn’t such an imperative, that <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/05/an_interview_w_13.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nathan Weaver didn’t even like <i>sunlight</i> very much</a>. Still, following the release of 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15835-celestial-lineage/""><i>Celestial Lineage</i></a>, their most compellingly restless album to date, they announced with some pomp that they were taking a break—not so much breaking up as <a href=""http://www.cvltnation.com/wolves-in-the-throne-roomself-release-of-two-hunters-vinylavailable-now/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“reconnecting to hearth and home.”</a> With Wolves in the Throne Room, most everything has always been an antagonistic, reactive event.</p>
<p>Given that steady tradition of ever-shifting defiance, Wolves in the Throne Room’s first album in three years, <i>Celestite</i>, represents a logical oxbow. The 46-minute record foregoes the band’s former volume and tempo for a liminal mix of synthesizers and beat machines, droning guitars and cascading horns. There are no propulsive blast beats or breathless tremolo guitars, no whispering-then-rushing song structures or majestically interjecting vocals. Instead, the Weavers used a panoply of modular and analog synthesizers to improvise collage-like instrumentals that pivot between the legacies of a dozen obvious predecessors. Those heroes come scattered between New Age and doom metal, industrial and electronica: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/967-coil/"">Coil</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Carpenter</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8800-hans-joachim-roedelius/"">Hans-Joachim Roedelius</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/685-wendy-carlos/"">Wendy Carlos</a>, <a href=""http://isham.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mark Isham</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6260-stephen-omalley/"">Stephen O’Malley</a> and so on. Backed by horns and woodwinds and assisted by producer Randall Dunn, Wolves in the Throne Room weave these five pieces together through slowly cycling beats and gradually decaying tones, attempting to create a seamless if very separate corollary to <i>Celestial Lineage</i>.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to have songs in that traditional sense,” <a href=""http://www.steelforbrains.com/post/91078196137/wolves-in-the-throne-room-ii"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aaron Weaver recently told the blog <i>Steel for Brains</i> about the material on <i>Celestite</i>.</a> “We wanted to have soundscapes, and we wanted to have washes. We wanted to have planets moving past each other.” But <i>Celestite</i> isn’t quite the about-face it may first seem or that the Weavers might have you to believe. Ambient and exploratory passages have always been an intriguing part of Wolves in the Throne Room’s approach, from the ululating female vocals that served as preludes to the field recordings and granulated sounds that functioned as interludes. In the past, those moments were mere window dressing, accessories that emboldened the power of everything else. Here, though, they become the main event, <a href=""http://www.healingcrystals.com/Celestite__Celestine__Articles_119.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the off-ramp from outright rampage to crystal healing.</a> <i>Celestite</i> is a small sample of the Wolves in the Throne Room aesthetic, writ large and with aplomb.</p>
<p>But <i>Celestite</i> falls far short of the canonical references it invokes, offering an attenuated version of the trips that its predecessors once provided. The same dogged mercury that made Wolves in the Throne Room interesting even when frustrating for the last decade turns <i>Celestite</i> into an indecisive mess. The operative pieces of opener “Turning Ever Towards the Sun”, for instance, are the first two words of its title; a montage of notions and ideas, it swivels between twinkling minimalism and droning languor, full-volume noise and movie-theme melodies, icy drift and humid electronica. During the 11-minute piece’s second half, a phantom beat emerges, throbbing beneath the shifts overhead. The pulse intensifies and quickens, suggesting that all this harried motion might lead to one magnetic moment. But the momentum stalls out, the possibility falling either to the band’s technical failure or philosophical non-commitment. It’s less a singular, captivating journey, a la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a> or <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/81882-Popol-Vuh"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Popol Vuh</a>, than a jumble of unsorted notions.</p>
<p>“Celestite Mirror,” the album’s other long haul, suffers the same shuffle mentality. The band moves between colossal organ roar and flute-led New Age vibrations, kill-switching the sounds as though the very concept of transition were poison. The piece ends with the record’s heaviest moment, as horns that could be sampled from a harrowing John Williams score undergird large-pawed guitar riffs. It’s flimsy, though, the Fisher-Price-sized version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13195-monoliths-dimensions/""><i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i></a>. That coda is the doom analogy of the effete krautrock and horror soundtrack approximations that litter most of <i>Celestite</i>—the sound is there, just not its spirit.</p>
<p>In the past and at their best, Wolves in the Throne Room have been able to overpower the seams in their composite music, to rely more on the romance of their clamor than their middling skills as composers. They managed to retrofit black metal to post-rock by force, not finesse. But <i>Celestite</i>’s instrumental expanse provides no such quarter. Wantonly skipping between sounds with a dilettante zeal, Wolves in the Throne Room seem woefully under equipped for this music. It’s hard not to get the sense that <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/arts/music/for-new-age-the-next-generation.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">they’ve simply been reading <i>The New York Times</i>.</a></p>
<p>Since word of Wolves in the Throne Room’s shift in sound began to spread earlier this year, there’s been a seeming quest for meaning in the decision, a search for profundity in their sudden deviation. Those who haven’t followed along have been dismissed as <a href=""http://www.steelforbrains.com/post/89160611377/wolves-in-the-throne-room-celestite"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gate-guarding philistines</a>, limited by definitions of metal or music or meaning at large. But why? Does a band deserve a free pass for making the “bold” decision to alienate its traditional fans, especially if that band’s reputation is built on a history of alienation at large? Apart from your allegiances to or apathy for black metal, isn’t it possible to see <i>Celestite</i> as a middling modular synthesizer record, where occasional moments of grace and power come swallowed by gyres of hesitation, especially when that electronic scene is now mining darkness on its own? Sure, Wolves in the Throne Room might be over black metal, but at least on <i>Celestite</i>, their next step remains far beyond their grasp.</p></div>"|19497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19497-wolves-in-the-throne-room-celestite/|4.7|Grayson Haver Currin

This isn’t a strike against the quality of G-Eazy’s work; his new album is well-crafted and considered. He seems unafraid to wrestle with mature ideas—about himself, or the sobering realization that living a dream is no exemption from life’s daily indignities. While one does get the feeling that there’s a better album somewhere inside of him, <i>These Things Happen</i> shows promise. If Macklemore is the first white rapper to find mainstream success with a mainly caucasian audience, G-Eazy will be the first to do so without relying on a dated notion of hip-hop’s sound. But ultimately <i>These Things Happen</i>’s strongest statement concerns the seismic impact of the artists who influenced its creation.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s no surprise that G-Eazy hails from Oakland—although, he went to school in Albany, California, according to <a href=""http://www.bhsjacket.com/entertainment/g%E2%80%93eazy_takes_inspiration_bay_area_roots"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this early interview</a>, which is closer to Berkeley. But regardless of the specifics, Bay Area hip-hop is historically a diverse ecosystem, so it makes sense as the first frontier for middle class-appealing white rappers to express themselves in a way that scans authentically. With a fertile independent scene largely cut off from hip-hop at large, the Bay was one place where regional stars were popular across cultural boundaries, with white kids as familiar with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Dre"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mac Dre</a> as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"">Jay Z</a>.</p>
<p>So it was with G-Eazy, whose <a href=""http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=321661"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">early work</a> shows the evident influence from the Bay’s cultural blender. His <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxV1_Lr1yf0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lyrics</a> on <i>These Things Happen</i> include references to growing up on Mac Dre and the hyphy movement, and the album features appearances from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"" target=""_blank"">E-40</a> and Bay producer <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/jayantmusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jay Ant</a>. <span>But outside of guest spots and textural references, the Bay Area influence feels absent G-Eazy’s current music, never mind the </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-dxZ3_3oBs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oldies revivalist single</a><span> that sparked his rise. Instead, the record is consistently moody and atmospheric, with a chilly downtempo ambiance less reminiscent of E-40 than </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a><span>’s </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_%2240%22_Shebib"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">producer of a similar name</a><span>. </span></p>
<p>This is not a record of hits, and there are no real pop moments. It's solemn, sincere, and deliberate, seemingly more influenced by self-serious auteurs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a> than G-Eazy's hometown heroes. It’s not the only place Kendrick’s influence looms; the way G-Eazy’s voice dips in “Opportunity Cost” is a deadringer for his delivery, and “Downtown Love”’s moralizing comes complete with a hammy chorus that would have fit comfortably alongside similar records on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15653-section80/""><i>Section.80</i></a>. “I Mean It"", meanwhile, suggests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a> may have had a bigger influence on millennial rap fans than has generally been acknowledged. Even the appearance of his mother’s voicemail at the end of “Opportunity Cost” can’t help but recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a>’s dad’s cameo on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18105-chance-the-rapper-acid-rap/""><i>Acid Rap</i></a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps most distracting is a song like “Tumblr Girls"", where a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_Kennedy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dom Kennedy</a> flow can’t save him from Drake’s blurry, neurotic solipsism. Here his writing is at its most cliched. He drinks with a beautiful nameless woman who’ll soon be forgotten, a story that borders on parody in 2014. All in all, <i>These Things Happen</i>’s sonic fingerprint feels like an unconscious echo of meteoric impact of post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a> rap stars of the past five or so years.</p>
<p>This is, after all, the sound of “respectable” sustainability: perhaps a bit of a flatline, <i>These Things Happen</i> is at its best when it twists the lens onto G-Eazy’s more personal writing. Although his fanbase was built on a grind that included the Vans Warped Tour and accompanying frat rapper <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodie_Allen"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hoodie Allen</a>, his immersion in hip-hop’s artistic language is real. His actual rap style is somewhat plain, but not distractingly so, and—”Tumblr Girls”-records aside—his writing is often purposeful. He’s started to emerge as a distinct voice: humble yet confident, the record is at its strongest when he’s taking stock of his rapidly shifting world and finding his place within it. On the album’s opener and title track, security stops him from going backstage, embarrassing the rapper: “Wait up, who the fuck are you?” These moments of humanity—the album’s best writing, that is—are only here in pieces, and to release a truly great project, he will either have to explore them in more depth, or start having a little more fun.</p></div>"|19479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19479-g-eazy-these-things-happen/|6.1|David Drake

That shrewd collection channeled loss into captivating songs, which Lew wrote over four years while grappling with both the weight of her fathers’ death and her own insomnia. Cold Beat’s new album, <i>Over Me</i>, is an extension of that melancholia, a space where Lew confronts grief through punchy post-punk.</p>
<p>Lew’s songwriting shifts between separate but related states—life and death, shadow and sun, together and apart, here and there. There’s a pained goodbye to a familiar place on “Abandon”, where her space in San Francisco is described as “Like a heroine in an old story disappears when fingers turn the page.” She’s restless, turning towards an unfamiliar oblivion in the record’s poppiest number, “Out of Time”. The infectious “Collapse” takes place within a cataclysm as it’s happening, with violins plucking at the tension of displacement. But there’s a sense of acceptance there too, although less pronounced. On the stomping “Tinted Glass,” she croons: “Unknown location/ No heart attached.”</p>
<p>Grass Widow specialize in girl-group vocal acrobatics; Lew’s meaty basslines take instrumental precedence in their saltwater-scuffed garage songs, but her voice is harder to pick out amongst the band’s three-part harmonies. <i>Over Me</i> finds her writing and recording on her own minimalist terms; even the vocal arrangements are sparse—it’s virtually all Lew, and she has a lovely voice, expressive and breathy. Her voice is mixed a bit too low, making it hard to hear the lyrics, but that fits <i>Over Me</i>'s<i> </i>broader theme of wrestling with and confronting identity. “Can’t see anything / Looking at my face / There’s nothing at all,” Lew confides to the listener in the pop-punk squalor of “Mirror”.</p>
<p>Lew has a remarkable talent for portraying scenes in the starkest terms. “Face of the clock is never kind,” she muses in the exuberant “Fatal Bond”, which could be mistaken as a B-side from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12058-parallel-lines-deluxe-edition/""><i>Parallel Lines</i></a>. She describes time as the ultimate “paralyzing fatal bond,” winding us in its gears. Violent symbols are everywhere. “Give your sharp knife,” she commands in the rollicking “UV,” while she dares her oppressor to chain her down in “OSOTW”. The symbols are survival mechanisms: weapons, mirrors, and blindfolds are all over the record, becoming instruments of simultaneous self-improvement and self-destruction. <i>Over Me</i> is Hannah Lew standing before the mirror, unsure of what she sees within herself, her future, her music. But she’s looking.</p></div>"|19498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19498-cold-beat-over-me/|7.6|Paula Mejia

The Los-Angeles-via-the-Philippines producer has always let gooey sentiments slide into his work, dating back to his earliest rinky-dink demos under the name <a href=""http://cocolulumusic.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cocolulu</a> made almost a decade ago. That willingness to let his feelings flutter out remains as he’s grown older and refined his style, blossoming on last year’s <i><a href=""http://spazzkid.bandcamp.com/album/desire"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Desire</a></i>. That full-length found Redito dipping into new sonic territories, from bouncy electro-pop to hushed numbers built around samples of Canadian duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28543-memoryhouse/"" target=""_blank"">Memoryhouse</a> that came off like a warped VHS tape. The one consistent element and what really elevated that album, however, was his lyrical honesty—the very first line on <i>Desire</i> was “We’ve only just begun/ but I think you’re the one/ breathing life into me,” and it only got more intimate from there. The latest offering from Spazzkid, the four-song <i>Promise</i> EP, is a worthy follow-up to the vulnerable-but-dreamy <i>Desire</i>, as Redito continues exploring the thrills and lows of romance without hesitation.<br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><br/>As charming as Redito’s emotional directness can be, he’s not just an adept diary keeper reciting his words over Garageband loops. His music-making smarts are just as solid, and his catalog has plenty of wordless highlights too, such as </span><i>Desire</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">’s woozy “</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1cKMawqFzQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kokeshi Doll</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">” and the J-pop-sampling “</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16145-weird-girl/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Weird Girl</a>"".<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> He’s taken cues from the beat music flowing out of LA over the last ten years and sculpted them into something all his own. Fittingly, one of the city’s electronic-scene mainstays </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8506-daddy-kev/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Daddy Kev </a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">mastered </span><i>Promise</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, giving Redito’s creations extra force compared to the wispier </span><i>Desire</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">. The EP opens with the instrumental “Lovers"", a number that slinks like a more jelly-limbed </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Toro Y Moi </a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">cut, punctuated by digitally twisted syllables.</span></p>
<p>“Lovers” also signals the biggest change between this EP and <i>Desire—</i>whereas Spazzkid operated in a more hushed, breath-on-neck mode last year, <i>Promise</i> leans towards ecstatic release. “Truly” recruits Sarah Bonito from poppy London trio <a href=""http://kerokerobonito.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kero Kero Bonito </a>to tag-team with Redito. She speak-sings her segments while switching between English and Japanese rapidly, keeping the song on its toes. The music matches Bonito’s playfulness, as Redito drops in various sampled sounds into the mix, ranging from vocal snippets to the familiar squeak of Jersey Club bed springs. The title track takes this joyful embrace to its limits, Redito’s devotional claims (“I want to be the one for you/ I think I’ll be the one for you/ to hold you and to cherish you”) soundtracked by the EP’s most energetic electronics, accented by his shouts, turning potential greeting-card fodder into a lively sentiment.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite the bulk of the EP being upbeat, the highlight of <i>Promise</i> comes when Redito faces the other way. “Goodbye” is built from faux steel drums and squiggly electronics, but coupled with the conflicted words at its center (“I’m leaving you tonight/ I hope someday everything’s gonna be alright”) the overall mood is less late July and more early October, the beaches all closed and good times well gone. Even though it's the droopiest moment here—Redito’s singing is especially meek—“Goodbye” still bursts into a jog in its back half, a twist that keeps the song from turning into too gloomy. <i>Promise</i> is a small introduction to Spazzkid, but one that highlights the project’s two strongest aspects—Redito’s directness and the lush music that makes him one of the most promising artists out of L.A. at the moment.</p></div>"|19593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19593-spazzkid-promise-ep/|7.4|Patrick St. Michel

In fact, Late Bloomer don’t think of their heroes as ""indie rock"" at all, but rather as some of the most popular bands of their time, actual<i> heroes </i>who deserve to be spoken of with grand gestures.</p>
<p>Though Late Bloomer’s forerunners have their moral, ethical and sonic superiority played up in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Our-Band-Could-Your-Life/dp/0316787531"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i></a>, one thing that gets understated is that those bands were the ones that <i>made it</i> (if not necessarily financially). And so Late Bloomer sees no issue with playing this kind of music as straight-up radio rock. Opener “Use Your Words” buzzes through a descending chord progression we’ve heard countless times as well as a lyrical paradox about the failure of language; there’s the fuzzed-out guitars, the thin leads over chunky, descending chords, the major 7ths offering a ear-turning dissonance. And yet, whereas most bands of this sort allow or prefer their vocals to be buried, Late Bloomer wants to be a pop band rather than a guitar band, maintaining the guileless melodic simplicity of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings"">Cloud Nothings</a> with the brutal pace and intensity of their present work.</p>
<p>While a strong lead single, <i>Things Change </i>quickly diverts from ""Use Your Words"" with a couple of reverberating anthems that go on for five minutes and more, recognizing that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6161-kurt-cobain/"">Kurt Cobain</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"">J. Mascis</a> likely played in the same venues as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2"">U2</a>. “Dr. Abernathy” and “Children” are proto-grunge transferred to an arena, though that doesn’t make them <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam"">Pearl Jam</a>; you hear a band that’s opening for someone at that level, belting it out even as maybe 1/4th of the attendees slowly file in.</p>
<p>There’s a degree of confidence that’s necessary to make music this familiar sound like it’s destined for something bigger than local acknowledgement; the dealer metaphor of “Dr. Abernathy” goes back damn near a half century to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver_(Beatles_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Revolver</i></a> but Neil Mauney belts it out like he’s the first person to ever cut out the middleman between the effect of the medicine and the guy who prescribes it. On the next track, he yells “I’M NOT WHO I THINK I SEE IN THE MIRROR!” and breaks out into some fancy hammer-on riffs like they’re trying to land a Guitar World transcription in 1995. If you stop for a second, “Mirror” sounds like positive reinforcement and epic negation at the same time, in other words, an alt-rock hit.</p>
<p>These moments tend to happen more often when Mauney is at lead; though bassist Josh Robbins has the more distinct vocal tone, Mauney’s better with the one-liners. Quite literally, as his verses tend to be a single phrase delivered with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan"">Bill Callahan</a>’s acerbic, deadpan succinctness<span>—</span>“I heard you like Jimi Hendrix too/ You smoke potpourri and then you go to school”; “I lost all the cassettes you gave to me/ There was good stuff on there."" Conserving energy by not really giving a shit becomes a manifestation of intelligence. And the emotional tenor of the LP is appropriately delivered on the title track:  “Things change/ I won’t change”. Is Mauney proud of being more unyielding than an inanimate object or the metaphysical? Or is this a terribly depressing confession?</p>
<p>There <i>is</i> a stubbornness that causes <i>Things Change t</i>o wane in its second half, and that’s Late Bloomer remembering their current situation: they’re a newish indie band in a relatively marooned indie rock locale (Charlotte) with a regrettable name knocking around in small shows. And the ambition occasionally reflects that: “No Mistakes” tastes of Tropical Skittles and the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28248-surfer-blood/"">Surfer Blood</a> album, elsewhere, they’re doing decent variations on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck"">Yuck</a>’s better songs. They’re still catchy, though <i>Things Change</i> wouldn’t really merit mention if Late Bloomer did nothing but exceed lowered expectations or just sound like a more polished version of their very undistinguished self-titled debut.</p>
<p>On the whole, <i>Things Change</i> is a nice surprise, an opening act that actually keeps your attention for the half hour they’re allotted, something that’s always a treat regardless of what genre it’s working—you don’t hear “potential” or the next great advance in indie rock. Maybe they’ll be emboldened by attention, maybe they’ll decide to get day jobs, maybe they’ll continue the exponential improvement.  That’s all up to Late Bloomer and how much they’re willing to change.</p></div>"|19578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19578-late-bloomer-things-change/|7.0|Ian Cohen

It followed a flurry of activity in 2013, including the release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18039-matthew-herbert-the-end-of-silence/""><i>The End of Silence</i></a>, an album structured around a sample of a plane dropping a bomb on Libya, and a 130-track box set of the house oriented material he’s released as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29142-herbert/"">Herbert</a>. Regarding the latter, it felt like a typically obtuse move to take arguably his most accessible work and turn it into a test of stamina. But at this point in his career there are few surprises from Herbert, to say the least. On <i>Part 6</i>, a follow-up to his <i>Part 1-5</i> series from the mid 90s, he strips out all the conceptual horseplay and follows a relatively smooth path. It’s hard to know whether it’s a confounding turn or a logical one. Somehow, it feels like both those things at the same time.</p>
<p>Nothing is ever played totally straight in Herbert’s world. He steadily works through styles over the four tracks on this EP, looping in strands of downtempo house, soul, funk, and acid house. It’s unabashedly retro in its trimmings, although like most Herbert releases, he always throws in elements that stop his audience from fully getting their bearings. “Grab That Bottle” may initially appear to be a direct march into blocky machine noise, but it evolves into something far more playful and light. In those moments Herbert reaches a point <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Richard D. James</a> sometimes aims for, somewhere between beauty and humor, like a bird pooping in your eye as you marvel at a spectacular sunset. Herbert’s career is full of such moments, but he’s managed to keep it fresh despite the enormous amount of releases under his belt, largely because of how well he executes the barrage of ideas charging through his mind.</p>
<p>Herbert specializes in tracks that pull you in with surface level fixtures, only to reveal greater depth once you’re two or three plays in. “My DJ” appears to be a light dance groove spun under a pitch-shifted vocal snippet, but dig deeper and there’s a far greater intricacy to it, with its repetitive piston-like rhythms resembling hundreds of tiny pieces of factory equipment all working in tandem. “Manny” works in the same way, only getting prettier and more inviting if you go the long haul with it, as its strings of dovetailing vocal samples open up to reveal a deeper level of complexity. Both tracks form a useful parallel to Herbert’s overall career, where most of his projects come bearing overarching concepts that come off as inspiring or insipid, and generally find a greater weight when you strip away a few layers of theoretical decoration. Those details are important, of course, but often only parts that build toward the greater whole.</p>
<p>Herbert's popularity has likely peaked, but the thought of him rising up as a contemporary <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Drummond"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bill Drummond</a>-type figure is certainly an intriguing proposition. The opening “One Two Three” from <i>Part 6</i> isn’t without its commercial charms, especially in the vocal from Rahel of the London-based <a href=""http://hejira.info/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hejira</a>. It’s perfect twilight-hours house, with Herbert mostly quashing the need to meddle and going straight down the line with a set of dimly-lit rhythms. Still, as with most of his material, it’s hard to imagine this getting play almost anywhere outside his cult, perhaps unfairly. On “One Two Three” he’s somewhere close to the song oriented material that lit up his excellent work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2963-roisin-murphy/"">Róisín Murphy</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5656-ruby-blue/""><i>Ruby Blue</i></a>, where he instinctively knew when to pull back from the brink. Here, Herbert’s somewhere between his avant and commercial selves, allowing two contrasting parts of his brain to feed off one another instead of going into all-out attack mode.</p></div>"|19599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19599-herbert-part-6-ep/|6.7|Nick Neyland

But even then, you could feel him striving to separate himself from the constraint of genre, and indeed, his best music emerged when he shelved his cursory or redundant beats and explored more ambient, textural terrain. Eventually, he became frustrated and uninspired, and briefly abandoned electronic music; he joined How to Dress Well’s touring band, and started working at the Toronto label Arts &amp; Crafts, looking for something new.</p>
<p>He appears to have found what he was looking for. His new album, <i>Falling Apart,</i> finds him in an exploratory mode, moving away from idiom and crafting a sound anchored by synths, piano keys, and a sense of narrative build. The record begins Eno-ambient and slowly builds into a momentous, sometime triumphant gloom that recalls a range of other electronic experimentalists from Shigeto to Daniel Lopatin. In an interview with <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2014/07/01/stream-babe-rainbows-debut-album-falling-apart-in-full/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fact Magazine</a>, Reed said that he did not want to be “saddled to a style or a genre,” and he has made good on that pledge.</p>
<p>The challenge for him, then, is to bring the different sounds and textures that he explores into harmony with each other. On the best tracks here, Reed takes his knowledge of a diverse array of styles and creates music with a sense of story. This holds true on both a track-to-track basis (the build from “Dub Music” to “Twin Peaks” to “Falling Apart” is exquisite), and within individual tracks. “Swept Stairs” is one of the longest tracks on the album, but it's constantly introducing something new, beginning as a buzzing ominous landscape and then shedding that skin in favor of a joyous, piano-powered anthem. “Things That Were Not” is another highlight, a haunted and unhinged cacophony that Reed manages to tame into a sensible moving machine.</p>
<p>Reed has freed himself to pursue music that isn’t easy to categorize or predict, but his sense of adventure can work against him. <i>Falling Apart </i>is uneven. “The Bells”, for instance, is one of the best tracks here, a propulsive dance-floor track banger. But it operates at about twice the speed as the rest of the album and it seems like an interjection from another record. Then too, there are songs like ""Plucks"" and ""The Walker"", which fail from lack of momentum. They might have made sense if they’d been placed in the first half of the album, when things are still moving at tortoise-pace, but they seem out of place and unnecessary here. Reed has found an admirable sound on <i>Falling Apart</i>, but his promise not to honor any one style ultimately hurts the album’s cohesion. </p></div>"|19547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19547-babe-rainbows-falling-apart/|6.5|Jonah Bromwich

When Raeph Glicken, Gary Bennett, and Paul Delaney of esteemed outfit Kill Your Idols branched off to form their blackened band in 2007, they abandoned the rigidity of their former craft almost immediately, focusing instead on long, winding assemblages of weeping guitars, thrashy tempos, and hard rock hooks. For every pound of black and roll gristle the band packed on to their most recent effort, 2010’s <i>Triumverate</i>, there was ample brain power to match—a labyrinthine riff here, a blast-beat there. Black Anvil's impressive balance of progressivism and putridity led to their prompt inclusion in the canon of overachieving area extremists, such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"" target=""_blank"">Liturgy</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26785-kralice/"" target=""_blank"">Krallice</a>.</p>
<p>If their new album <i>Hail Death </i>serves as any indication, the New Yorkers have no intention of going back to basics. To buttress their fanged jams and fill in some holes in their current live setup, they’ve added a second guitarist, named Sos, to their ranks, granting a boost to both melodics and critical mass. They’re amping up the concepts as well: <i>Hail Death </i>centers around around the inevitable end, as well as the varying degrees of madness which emerge as its approach hastens. The band treats their theme with wicked reverence, expanding the song lengths to accommodate more swells and swathes of feedback. At the same time, they’re the most batshit band of conductors, ceaslessly toggling between turbo and turbid. There’s “Seven Stars Unseen”, a harrowing ride through the void that straddles the threshold between dirge and d-beat, and opener “Still Reborn”, whose rich Spanish guitar provides a haunting contrast to the electrics that scream in their stead.</p>
<p>Barring the 12-minute “Next Level Black”’, which never seems to muster up enough magnitude, the metamorphic approach bodes well for Black Anvil. This is due largely to their appointment of engineer J. Robbins (Modern Life is War, Government Issue), whose conservative approach to mixing ensures that <i>Hail Death</i>’s many guitars don’t collapse into one low-res mess. By putting Bennett and Sos further back, he creates a pocket of space for the vocalists’ lilting harmonies to seep in, lending straightforward headbangers like “ Until the End” morbid beauty. Distinguishing between individual riffs proves trickier, as their already-reduced presence is placed constantly under threat by the throttle of the blast-beats. The only fretwork left to gawk at are the solos, which follow in the slithering style of <a href=""http://marduk.nu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marduk</a> and, while far from revolutionary, serve an invaluable role in maintaining momentum when things slow to a stoned sprawl. </p>
<p>“To us, it’s the next level,” Glicken said in a recent <i>Decibel </i><a href=""http://www.decibelmagazine.com/featured/db-exclusive-making-hail-death-documentary/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">documentary</a> chronicling the making of <i>Hail Death</i>, ""Something to aim for, something to shoot for, something to take me out of this mundane existence.” His vague phrasing begs the question: is Black Anvil’s death drive fueled by their art, or is it the other way around? On <i>Hail Death</i>, the relationship is symbiotic; the album's darkness fuels its shifting sounds, which in turn amplfies the dread. Hopefully, as the outfit continues this march of mayhem, the hellish balance will remain intact, securing the band’s reputation for mongrel metaphysics.</p></div>"|19440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19440-black-anvil-hail-death/|7.5|Zoe Camp

The line is delivered with a shrug and a whisper, the downy electric guitars blotting out Wilson's voice like the cotton balls in a pill bottle. Wilson has perfected the hangdog-loser pose that pairs naturally with dreamy indie-pop, but <i>Easy to Forget</i> is the work of someone talented and confident, and not looking to be forgotten. </p>
<p>SIGHS is a studio project for now, not quite a band, and the six songs on this EP have the feel of a progress report. Wilson writes in scraps and fragments and often records to whatever consumer technology is handy—the voice memo app on his cell phone, for instance. The second half of <i>Easy to Forget</i> consists of his home demos, unvarnished. And these are <i>particularly</i> unvarnished: The rhythm track of ""Sights"" is an actual, dully clacking metronome, with a single keyboard note quivering feebly above it. It's not much to go on, but even here the sturdy bones of Wilson's songwriting are traceable, and it's not a massive leap to imagine the tremendous power-pop song the demo longs to burst into.  ""Sights"", along with ""Lifetime Away"" and ""Waste"", feel like diary exercises in the workbook of an excellent songwriter, but they don't quite work as lo-fi recordings, for reasons that are made abundantly clear in the EP's first half.</p>
<p>The first three songs—""Easy To Forget"", ""Bruise"", and ""Fears""—were recorded with Misha Hering at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/holymountainstudios"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Holy Mountain Studio</a>, and they gleam like cake toppers. The arrangement to ""Easy to Forget"" bustles with Northern-soul horns, pianos, chimes, synths, and the chorus, warmed with backing vocals (""You know this house, it holds so many memories/ you know this house, it holds so many threats"") opens like a time-lapse video of a flower blooming. The chord progressions on ""Bruise"" feels deftly patterned after the Posies, in their <i>Frosting on the Beater</i> era, and the sound is similar: The distortion thick, the mood downbeat, the songs whipped higher than meringue peaks.  </p>
<p>Wilson is sharp with opening couplets, which often sketch vivid scenes in minimal space. ""Bruise"", which is sung to a friend trapped in an abusive relationship, opens with him picking up the phone: ""Wasn't expecting this call, wasn't expecting this news/ In seconds empires fall, in seconds lies become truths."" ""Easy to Forget"" begins with the bemusing couplet ""'L-M-A-K-O-A E-F-X'/ She hammers at the keys, though it didn't make sense."" Wilson has a feel for the gentle, compassionate darkness that often feeds the subtext of the best indie-pop. His voice is human, self-deprecating, and relatable, and when he concludes ""Bruise"" with the simple, disarming promise ""If you talk, I'll listen,"" he's affecting, too. There are a million just-okay power-pop bands and a scarce handful of great (or potentially great) ones, and it's heartening to hear a new band with some latent greatness in it. </p></div>"|19538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19538-sighs-easy-to-forget-ep/|7.0|Jayson Greene

He started the <a href=""http://www.simplerecords.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Simple</a> imprint in 2003 and three years later launched <a href=""http://www.ausmusic.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aus</a> with help from Cornwall musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1490-fink/"">Fin Greenall</a>. Both labels continue to release material, but Aus in particular has developed into one of the UK’s most notable house/techno imprints. At its best, Aus has served as a breeding ground for promising talent, and even its lesser releases over the last few years have lent the label a reputation for consistency.</p>
<p>Aus and Simple have released their share of floor-driven bangers but both tip towards subtlety, and that extends to Saul’s own work as a producer and DJ. In the former guise, he’s worked infrequently and under his own name; last year, he released a solo album as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31253-close/"">Close</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18187-close-getting-closer/""><i>Getting Closer</i></a>, that mixed conventional melodic form with slow-burn pacing while yielding two club jams, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15250-beam-me-up-ft-charlene-soraia-and-scuba-george-fitzgerald-remix/"">Beam Me Up</a>” and “<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/willsaul/close"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OSCAR</a>”. The approach extends to his DJ work. Although sections of his 3xCD <i>Balance</i> mix in 2009 showed his skill with uptempo pyrotechnics, elsewhere he’s favored a more patient structure. This was none more apparent than on his contribution to BBC radio’s Essential Mix series last year, which found him leaning on key players from his labels’ rosters to create a mix that relied more on mood than immediacy.</p>
<p>His latest mix, for <a href=""http://www.k7.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">!K7</a>’s esteemed <a href=""http://www.dj-kicks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>DJ-Kicks</i></a> series, continues in that vein, with Saul tapping frequent Aus and Simple contributors for unreleased cuts and showing off some of the label’s more notable recent releases over the course of its 80-minute runtime. His feel for composition hasn't diminished; the mix’s first 12 minutes move by at a slow climb, setting a gradually evolving mood. Things finally pick up during the back half of head-in-the-clouds Berlin techno producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31398-youandewan/"">Youandewan</a>’s “Ego”, which develops from a wet pound into a spinning array of soft-focus tones. ""Ego"" has the feel of a track that transforms the mix into something greater, but instead it transitions into <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/jabrumusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jabru</a> and <a href=""http://www.joelculpepper.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joel Culpepper</a>’s ”Church”, a sultry, shuffling vocal tune that sounds nice enough but would’ve fit better alongside <i>Getting Closer</i>’s avant-pop stylings.</p>
<p>Last year, Spanish deep-house producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/"">John Talabot</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18749-john-talabot-dj-kicks/"">own entry</a> in the <i>DJ-Kicks</i> series proved it was possible to create a forceful document that unraveled with a slow, psychedelic feel; so the relative stasis of Saul’s entry is, on one level, a letdown. While its stilted, dreamy sense of pacing is easy enough to get lost in, it’s even easier to tune out entirely. Still, engaging stretches abound: Swedish house producer and co-head of the playful <a href=""http://www.studiobarnhus.se/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Studio Barnhus</a> imprint <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31750-axel-boman/"">Axel Boman</a> impresses with the wobbly, crisp-light “Dubbel (Dub)”, while the mix’s final third locks into a satisfactorily consistent groove cemented by Saul’s ruddy gear workout “Pedal Power” and Dutch weirdo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29894-legowelt/"">Legowelt</a>’s watery, aptly named “Ethereal Techno Music Will Never Die”.</p>
<p>Of the three roles Saul plays, his talents as curator are most evident, and so the best moments of his <i>DJ-Kicks</i> installment are from artists who’ve made their name, partially or entirely, through releases on his labels. Irish duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31211-bicep/"">Bicep</a>, who have achieved a startling level of consistency over the last few years, return with the skipping, high-octane “Nova”, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30090-george-fitzgerald/"">George FitzGerald</a>, one of house music’s rising talents, comes through with a big-room sheen and computerized vocals on “Wanting Needing”. Depending on where you looked, FitzGerald’s tunes were all anyone could talk about in 2013; this year, that title belongs to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31402-leon-vynehall/"">Leon Vynehall</a>, whose <a href=""https://clone.nl/item30212.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Music for the Uninvited</i></a> showcased an appealing, tasty approach to house. His contribution to Saul’s <i>DJ-Kicks</i>, “Time”, is out of step with his usual jacking fare and all the better for it, a wistful slice of body music that wields subtlety with a steady hand. The lovely, subdued “Time” is a prime example of the type of refined dance music Saul’s expertly curated over the last decade or so; his <i>DJ-Kicks</i> mix could use more moments like it, but the highlights compiled here nonetheless speak to Saul’s excellent taste, as well as a reminder of why Aus and Simple have been worth following. </p></div>"|19463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19463-will-saul-dj-kicks/|6.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

So many of their peers have gotten the band back together recently and the excitement of seeing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54851-american-football-reunite-for-first-shows-in-15-years"">American Football</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54919-mineral-reuniting-for-first-shows-in-17-years"">Mineral</a> for the first time since the late 1990s might lead you to overlook Braid having played Fun Fun Fun Fest in 2012 or a couple of gigs in 2004. Or maybe it’s just that their 2011 EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15697-closer-to-closed/""><i>Closer to Closed</i></a> is better off being forgotten. It was a Braid release in name alone—one cover and three nondescript, tentative Braid originals made less because they wanted or needed to, but because they <i>could</i>. The one lyric I remember was fitting: “I want a do over.” Consider <i>No Coast</i> a promise kept.</p>
<p><i>No Coast</i> doesn't pick up where <i>Frame &amp; Canvas</i> left off. It doesn't sound like a band in their mid-20s, though you could hear the antsy, arms-akimbo “Put Some Wings on That Kid” and “Lux” as an effort by Braid to show they’re still capable of playing songs from their under-appreciated second album <i>The Age of Octeen</i>. Rather, this is precisely the kind of album you’d expect out of Braid if they kept going after <i>Frame &amp; Canvas</i> and learned how to adjust with age. Unlike <i>Closer to Closed</i>, <i>No Coast</i> retains an identifiable Braid-ness, the knotty musicianship that subsequent offshoot Hey Mercedes untangled and straightened<span>—</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">the sudden stops and cuts, vocals in friendly competition, an active, inventive rhythm section that never calls attention to its trickery.</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> Singer Bob Nanna was hoping people would consider Braid as a forerunner </span><i>and</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> a peer of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31918-you-blew-it"">You Blew It!</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31505-a-great-big-pile-of-leaves"">A Great Big Pile of Leaves</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, and you can definitely hear where their new label-mates got some of their moves.</span></p>
<p>But the new guys operate at full speed; Braid don’t have the athleticism or explosiveness of their earlier days, but in a Tim Duncan way, they’re craftier, better about picking their spots. “Bang” and the title track showcase Braid’s rhythmic double clutches, their pivots after sudden silence in more methodical, midtempo ways, patiently working towards conventionally pleasing codas. Other times, Braid just goes straight for the big, alt-rock chorus, as “East End Hollows” and “Damages!” show Chris Broach channeling his agitation into legitimate, singalong (not <i>shout</i>-along) hooks. His vocals have developed a high, Mark Hoppus nasality, which has the occasionally unfortunate effect of stressing some of <i>No Coast</i>’s too-cute lyrical puns. But it plays wells with the more measured and mature Nanna. While they maintain the exuberance of having too much to say at the same time, the two vocalists are less likely to topple over each other; check the one-man give-and-go on “Many Enemies”, or the pick-and-roll performed during the bridge of “East End Hollows”. In fact, on a song-by-song basis, <i>No Coast</i> is actually more consistent than <i>Frame &amp; Canvas</i>, though it wants for something as scene-defining as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4-hn4yltI&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The New Nathan Detroits”</a>.</p>
<p>But maybe they’re in a position define an entire new “scene”, or at least a demographic. With the exception of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9879-lifetime"">Lifetime’s 2007 self-titled return</a>, I’m not sure if there’s much precedent for artists from this world making such a strong statement in their late-30s as the <i>same band</i>. And so <i>No Coast</i> is an inspired record for a very tangible reason that goes beyond associating with an in-demand producer (Will Yip) and a hip new label: Braid have taken stock of their own lives as unintentional elder statesmen and treat it as worthwhile subject matter.</p>
<p>“Light Crisis” begins with an old recording from Nanna’s grandfather, while “Put Some Wings on That Kid” obliquely references the adoptee’s <a href=""http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/06/12/braids-bob-nanna-talks-about-his-bands-forthcoming-album-no-coast"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent discovery of his birth parents</a>. But such direct, autobiographical details are less frequent that the generational resonance found in the title track’s opening line: “No coast/ Is how I feel the most/ In the middle, a little invisible, the ghost.” The title of <i>No Coast</i> was intended as positive reinforcement for the band, and it’s also indicative of a spiritual displacement, of being overlooked and at the same time, not quite sure if you're confident enough to be looked at. Two of the first three songs contain the line, “This is the life,” most notably in “No Coast”: “This is the life we chose”. That life being one that hasn’t gotten Nanna or Broach much separation from the scene and people who might refer to Braid as “legendary” or <i>Frame &amp; Canvas</i> as a “classic”; they probably get recognized in bars, have some nice email exchanges and the occasional shout out from an up-and-coming band. But these aren’t the sort of things that would satisfy the nagging parent in “The New Nathan Detroits,” the one asking them if all of this will ever compare to a house, kids, and everything else that seemed for the taking for a band of Braid’s ilk right before emo's commercial breakthrough.</p>
<p>Nanna spends a lot of time in that ""middle"" he speaks of, not quite domesticated, but not young and untamed either; when he calls himself a ""runaway train"" on ""Bang"", it sounds like an admission of being set in one's ways rather than out of control. <i>No Coast</i> is very, <i>very</i> Chicago in both sound and spirit (specific streets are name-dropped on “Light Crisis”), though in Nanna and Broach’s lyrics, you’d think it was the world’s biggest college town and any given day can be a class reunion that allows you to feel the same twinge of warm nostalgia and cold reality of time moving forwards. “East End Hollows” initially sounds laudatory, Broach dreaming of “drunk lust and punk love” and reveling in a DIY spirit where “happiness is in the doing, in the making.” The catchiest song on <i>No Coast</i> is the most conflicted as well, as Broach notes the false sense that happiness is also tied up in the gossip of “who knows who and what happened” and bars where diehards balance “Another drink/ Another lifetime of regret.” The chorus “You take these dreams and throw them out the window” can sound like a command rather than a lament, of Broach try to live the ideals of “no coast” surrounded by people who aren’t doing shit besides resting on their laurels.</p>
<p>But there’s no bitterness in <i>No Coast</i>, just perspective and empathy for those who actively seek to follow in their path. Nanna understands the inherent, nostalgic pull of listening to Braid in the first place and his lyrics often follow suit; he’s wishing for his bucket of old tricks in “Damages!” and grapples with young love transitioning into suburban comfort on “Pre-Evergreen"". Meanwhile Broach laments faded friendship on “Many Enemies” and marvels at the blind energy of youth of “Doing Yourself In”. Or at least that’s what I hear; Nanna and Broach are more careful about choosing their words as well and while <i>No Coast</i> is always emotive, it’s open-ended and serves to point out that for many, the “emo” established by Braid and their ilk and sought after by their fans constitutes a set of musical values as defined and worthwhile as “post-punk” or “house”. Nanna expressed that he wanted <i>No Coast</i> to be “exciting and vital for people that aren’t in their late 30s,” and those who’ll check it out simply because it’s on Topshelf won't be let down. But if you're a <i>Frame &amp; Canvas </i>lifer who's made a home and put the kids in their beds, <i>No Coast</i> lets you know the great mistakes to make and chances to take are still out there.</p></div>"|19502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19502-braid-no-coast/|7.7|Ian Cohen

Dozens of websites quickly reacted in horror to the clip, outraged at her robotic, personality-devoid back-up dancers and her “appropriation” of Japanese culture. These criticisms were valid, but few pointed out who Lavigne took the most cues from-Harajuku-raised fashion-blogger-turned-model-turned J-pop-singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31566-kyary-pamyu-pamyu/"" target=""_blank"">Kyary Pamyu Pamyu</a>. Lavigne mimicked the way she often bases her fashion <a href=""http://jto.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fs20130430a1a-870x578.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on sweets</a>, and filmed the bulk of “Hello Kitty” in Kyary’s stomping grounds, even dancing in a store whose clothes Kyary modeled early in her career. It was a clear stab at replicating her visual aesthetic, something many Japanese viewers picked up on.</p>
<p>Lavigne didn’t pick a bad artist to imitate, though. Kyary’s imaginative get-ups and surreal videos have turned her into one of Japan’s premier performers and the most globally visible J-pop star today. Outside of her home country she’s still a niche act, but one whose developed a fanbase capable of selling out a three-continent-spanning tour and attracted admirers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30667-ryan-hemsworth/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Ryan Hemsworth</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Grimes</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DADgsW4JCV0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Katy Perry</a>. Yet non-Japanese media focuses almost exclusively on her visual side, with many write-ups and reviews focusing on her “quirky,” “colorful,” and “bizarre” side. Her music is often an afterthought. Kyary’s songs, however, are far more complex than any of those adjectives imply, and her third full-length, <i>Pika Pika Fantajin</i>, highlights the diversity within her songbook. Despite being her least consistent release to date, it still reveals she’s more than a weird-Japan meme.</p>
<p>It helps that Yasutaka Nakata, one of the most famous Japanese producers of the last decade, writes Kyary’s songs. With his personal project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31764-capsule/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Capsule</a> and the chart-topping trio Perfume, he crafted catchy music bridging the gap between 1990s Shibuya-kei and more modern maximalist electro-pop. Working with Kyary has allowed him to experiment, peaking with Kyary’s 2013 earworm-packed <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18369-kyary-pamyu-pamyu-nanda-collection/"">Nanda Collection</a></i>, which doubled as a thoughtful look at the onset of adulthood. <i>Fantajin</i> isn’t as lyrically deep, but features similarly catchy pop via its singles—“<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bFHzDa9U9w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mottai-Nightland</a>” is a good gateway into her peppier material, the song ringing forward breathlessly towards a playful center. Even better is “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35FbwCIxT0g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kira Kira Killer</a>,” the album’s most radio-ready cut. Nakata builds the song from the same bells and digital whistles as “Mottai-Nightland”, but rounds it out with a bouncy chorus wherein every syllable shines and Kyary’s backing swoons make it all the sweeter.</p>
<p>These songs have been ever-present on Japanese TV and radio since their release, but it’s not just because of their catchiness. Many J-pop singles come into existence thanks to advertising campaign tie-ins, companies approaching well-known performers and giving them a vague idea what they want and letting them come up with the rest. The aforementioned Kyary tracks both soundtrack ads for cellphones, while another <i>Fantajin</i> number, “Yumeno Hajima Ring Ring”, serves as a theme for an apartment-finding app. What separates Kyary (and Nakata) from many other J-pop acts is a refusal to be lazy about it, as they try to make these more than disposable jingles. Whereas many other songs aimed at graduating students (possibly in need of housing) are gloopy ballads, the melancholy “Yume” skips ahead, backed by breezy guitar and <a href=""http://kyarychan.tumblr.com/post/77913822247/lyrics-yume-no-hajima-ring-ring-the"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">anxious lyrics </a>more worried about the future than nostalgia. Even “Family Party”, created as the theme song for an animated movie—an assignment Nakata has mailed in before—at least finds Kyary trying out a chirpy chiptune sound that is serviceable for its brief run time.</p>
<p>Fantajin’s most interesting developments come on the album-only cuts. “Serious Hitomi” rolls out the most aggressive guitar playing to appear on a Kyary Pamyu Pamyu song, yet the in-your-face playing backs up a song about being deeply shy, and swivels into one of the best and cuddliest choruses on the album. “Tokyo Highway” teases EDM with its skittering repetition of Kyary’s voice, but Nakata never lets the song drop in on itself, instead settling into a twinkling jog accented by the prettiest keyboard plinks on the album. But <i>Fantajin</i>’s highlight is also its biggest curveball. “Sungoi Aura” plays out like a silly Broadway musical number more than a pop song, but it features Kyary at her most clever, lyrically, and Nakata nailing all the details needed to really sell the theatrical bend of the track (those piano flairs!).</p>
<p>Pushing yourself, however, means falling flat on your face sometimes. “Koi Koi Koi""'s semi-creepy-waltz vibe runs out of steam quickly, while closing track “Explorer” features sparse production that puts the spotlight on Kyary Pamyu Pamyu’s voice, which is not equipped for hitting the high-notes she aims for here. The biggest misfire on <i>Fantajin</i>—and the worst song of her career thus far—is “Ring a Bell,” her first all-English effort. Its existence is strange enough, given that her growing international fanbase doesn’t seem to care if she can sing a song in English. It sounds like a bad children’s TV show theme that ran out of ideas in 30 seconds pressed on for more than four minutes.</p>
<p><i>Fantajin</i> stumbles at times and ultimately feels like a transitional album, but its mix of new sonic twists and straight-up pop delicacies make for good listen overall, underscoring the fact that Kyary Pamyu Pamyu is more than a YouTube oddity. And more people are picking up on that: Kyary is currently working with <a href=""http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/19825/1/kyary-pamyu-pamyu-gets-kawaii-with-sophie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wonky producer Sophie and French pop act Yelle on new music</a>, an intriguing development in her still-young career.</p></div>"|19592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19592-kyary-pamyu-pamyu-pikapika-fantasian/|6.7|Patrick St. Michel

What<a href=""http://theproperornaments.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> the Proper Ornaments</a> have in common with ""The Proper Ornaments"", from 1967 opus <i>Kites Are Fun</i>, isn't immediately obvious, but it starts with a penchant for hypnotic harmonies and continues with an insistence on the right decorations. Where those sunshine-y forebears quasi-ironically skewered ""Mad Men""-era superficiality—""brand new car,"" ""hat and gloves,"" ""pretty wife who you almost love""—the '10s model proudly accessorizes itself with scruffy neo-psych.</p>
<p>The stylistic touches on <i>Wooden Head</i>—billed as the Proper Ornaments' proper debut LP after last year's promisingly ramshackle <i>Waiting for the Summer</i>, which collected previously released singles and EPs—are extraordinarily ordinary ones for an indie band. Next to those sweet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Beach Boys</a> vocal counterpoints sit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"" target=""_blank"">Byrds</a>-buzzing guitar interplay and some-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a>-morning detachment. With its rickety eight-track recording, you'd be hard-pressed to guess whether the album was influenced more by the O.G.s or their offshoots: the British <i>C86</i> scene, California's Paisley Underground movement, New Zealand's Flying Nun label. In woolier moments, throw in the Beta Band. In shoegazier, throw in Ride or even early the Verve. There's a song called ""Stereolab""; it actually sounds a bit like a Stereolab.</p>
<p>As that list of comparisons probably suggests, the Proper Ornaments mix and match these related yet distinct sonic accoutrements well enough that they might one day become a reference point themselves—which you might expect, considering they've shared bills with fellow magpie-connoisseurs such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5753-crystal-stilts/"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Stilts</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"" target=""_blank"">Woods</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>. As with those bands' efforts, though, <i>Wooden Head</i> is strongest when it leaves you remembering smart hooks rather than a clever aesthetic. Check out ""Magazine,"" maybe the breeziest song ever from the point of view of ammunition, or elegiac finale ""You'll See"". Weather, a recurring theme since the previous record, is beside the point on the gentle ""Summer's Gone"", which applies the sepia softness of the Clientele to being ""old enough to lose your own mind."" </p>
<p>For every band like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5337-los-campesinos/"" target=""_blank"">Los Campesinos!</a>, who turn their indie-inclined record collections into something appealing of their own, music history is littered with others who mine the clerk-approved past without adding much to those halcyon days at all. Claps and Hoare, joined here by bassist Daniel Nellis and drummer Robert Syme, certainly skirt that risk—the guitar chimes on ""What Am I to Do?"" bring to mind ""Dear Prudence"" by the Beatles, whose enshrined-in-marble likeness rarely flatters anybody. But the Proper Ornaments may have been just as shrewd in naming their album as in naming their band: <i>Wooden Head</i> was the title of a 1969 odds and ends compilation by the Turtles, released after the ""Happy Together"" group split. As humble, tastefully appointed psych-pop goes, the Proper Ornaments surely have their hearts—and heads, wooden or not—in the right place.</p></div>"|19550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19550-the-proper-ornaments-wooden-head/|7.0|Marc Hogan

The California psyche-pop duo’s latest album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/484-family-crimes/"">Family Crimes</a></i>, has a triptych of love songs that are gentle enough to only scratch the surface of melancholy. “Love Is a Shadow” shuffles through piles of fallen leaves, with Quinn and Donaldson harmonizing like sun and honey. “Is It Love, Love Love” saunters along, a nugget of cosmic country with an aftertaste of Tang instead of blotter acid. And “It’s Not Love”, the darkest of the three, goes so far as to sketch an ever-so-slightly harrowing scenario on a sheet of squeaky-clean folk-pop: “Too much blood on the water/ Nothing left to say/ It’s not love/ It’s just blood.” It’s alright, ma; they may be only bleeding, but they have a box of Band-Aids handy. The Skygreen Leopards once wrote songs with far more twists and turns. In particular, 2006’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9550-disciples-of-california/"">Disciples of California</a> </i>embraced ragged edges, off-the-beat wobble, and an almost aggressive lethargy. That slight yet deliberate rawness is all but gone on <i>Family Crimes</i>; in its place is soft-focus haze that barely conceals the group’s penchant for neat-as-a-pin precision.</p>
<p>Mostly, it works: “WWIII Style” is breathless, studio-apartment pop, with the high notes seemingly sung into a sink. “Reno Wedding” rings and twangs with Byrds-like shimmer as Quinn’s and Donaldson’s voices tumble out of them like bashful apologies. There are regrets embedded in “Crying Green &amp; Purple” and “Mascara Priscilla”—they do both allude to tears, after all—but the clouds are thin and wispy, and they’re blown away as quickly as they gather.</p>
<p>Some of the internal references on <i>Family Crimes </i>feel like hyperlinks. “Leave the Family”—a gorgeous splay of Crayola colors and therapeutic jangle—is later reincarnated as “Leave the Family Reprise”, a sloth-paced coda that acts more as a balm than a parting shot. And when the la-la-la-happy “Josephine” segues into “Mascara Priscilla”, it’s as if they’re flip sides of the same conflicted character. “I’m all right with the Christian life,” goes a line in “Mascara Priscilla”, and the reference to the Byrds’ cover of The Louvin Brothers’ “The Christian Life” feels less like a wink and more like a solemn nod.</p>
<p>Nebulous Christian themes have popped up before in the Skygreen Leopards’ songbook, and <i>Family Crimes</i> is no different. “Suburban Bibles” is so mumbly and bright-eyed, it might as well be a sing-song lullaby for Sunday school naptime. “Selling T-Shirts” even veers into the realm of Jonathan Richman with its chiming strum and the mundane juvenilia of lines like, “Drop me off at the shopping center.” Granted, the phrase “Quaalude rapture” is also bandied about; the pharmaceutical-friendly Skygreen Leopards of old still make their presence known, just more subtly and wryly. Quinn and Donaldson may be getting somewhat longer in the tooth, but they’re sounding younger. And whatever darkness lurks within <i>Family Crimes</i> is swallowed back down with a wise, dreamy smile.</p></div>"|19496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19496-the-skygreen-leopards-family-crimes/|7.2|Jason Heller

In truth, its history and function is more like early hip-hop’s: Party music that doubled as a delivery system for current events, street wisdom, social humor, and reflections on daily life from the vantage point of an imagined Average Joe.</p>
<p>Take some of the songs on <a href=""http://www.souljazzrecords.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soul Jazz’</a>s new compilation, <i>Calypso: Musical Poetry in the Caribbean</i>, whose subjects include the James Bond movie <i>Goldfinger</i>, the 1969 Moon landing, interracial heart transplants, and how a young man who calls himself Brownie would like to be reincarnated as a bedbug so he can nibble on the asses of any woman he deems chubby enough.</p>
<p>They are sweet songs, told with a big heart and sly sense of humor. Even when political, they are good-natured, almost resigned, more apt to shrug at the chaos of life than imagine they can do anything to control it. Listen to 1980s hardcore and you may come out incensed by evil and greed; listen to calypso and you may come out feeling like your only recourse is to raise an eyebrow and watch the parade go by. Calypso’s ambivalence is especially interesting given that it reached full bloom during the 1940s, when American occupation of Trinidad had led to economic inflation and a spike in prostitution. It could have been protest music but it took the high road and became satire.</p>
<p>As advertised, <i>Musical Poetry</i> spans 1955-1969. In 1948, Calypsonians like Lord Kitchener and Young Tiger had moved to London to get work at clubs. (Where did these people get their names? My only answer implies the existence of divinity.) In 1950, the West Indies cricket team beat England at Lord’s, a symbolic event commemorated in Lord Beginner’s “Victory Test Match”. By 1957, the Guyanese performer Cy Grant was making regular appearances on a BBC news program called <i>Tonight</i>, where he sang <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ21FPr9S2U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">short calypsos about daily events</a>, each with the assurance that “We bring you the news that you ought to know/ In Tonight's topical calypso.” What started as regional Trinidadian music had by the mid-1950s become continental pop.</p>
<p><i>Musical Poetry</i> is charming but lightweight. Several of its tracks are instrumental, which offer glimpses into the genre’s connection with jazz but aren’t sticky or complex enough to come back to. Though I hoped Young Growler would be able to break his prepubescent fascination with the name Pussy Galore while singing about <i>Goldfinger</i>, it was not to be, nor is Azie Lawrence able to offer insight into England’s Carribean Diaspora beyond the notion that they must get pretty cold in the winter. And black people are great athletes and white people can’t dance, et cetera. One of the album’s highlights, “The Bedbug Song”, is a cover of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44ZjC9BWZM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mighty Spoiler</a>, which is only disappointing because one of the wonderful promises of calypso is that anyone can get up there and offer their weird little opinion, sans poetry or finesse.</p>
<p>My favorite song here might be Lord Cobra’s “Negro Heart”, which reports novel news of the world’s first successful human heart transplant, performed in late 1967 by the South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard. For a calypso, the song is uncharacteristically mournful, processing at a mid tempo in a minor key. “I hope I am not talking to quickly,” Cobra says. “It’s a negro that did do the trick/ The heart patient was living the longest, a negro heart beating inside his chest.”</p>
<p>Only that wasn’t what actually happened. The donor, Denise Darvall, was a white woman who’d been fatally killed in a car crash the day earlier. Cobra’s news is a fiction. The salience of the metaphor is not lost, especially in the context of music born in the colonies and popularized among the supposed civility of the mainland: Inside a white man beats a black man’s heart. “Bom, bom, bom,” the backing vocalists chant in rhythm, mimicking the pump.</p>
<p>For interested parties, there are other, better places to start: Mighty Sparrow’s <i>Volume One</i>, Rounder Records’ <i>Calypso Calaloo</i>, the first volume of the perennially lauded series <i>London Is the Place for Me</i>, released by Damon Albarn’s Honest Jon’s label. <i>Calypsos From Trinidad: Politics, Intrigue and Violence in the 1930's</i> is great too, as is <i>16 Carnival Hits</i>, by Sparrow and Lord Kitchener.</p>
<p>The lessons of the genre—stay grounded, pay attention, nourish your skepticism and don’t forget to laugh—seem bizarrely unheralded. I, for one, tend to side with Viper, a singer who takes news of the Russian space dog Laika as final evidence that he would be better off on all fours, “Eating all good things as I like, and now and then a cruise in a satellite.” </p></div>"|19493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19493-various-artists-calypso-musical-poetry-in-the-caribbean-1955-69/|6.3|Mike Powell

Both their albums, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12285-women/""><i>Women</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14694-public-strain/""><i>Public Strain</i></a>, had the air of works made in isolation, with the band members cut adrift from contemporary movements and prevailing stylistic forces. Women ended in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40559-women-cancel-tour-after-clashing-onstage/"">acrimony</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45510-rip-women-guitarist-christopher-reimer/"">tragedy</a>, but two of their number, Matt Flegel and Mike Wallace, have picked up the pieces in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32165-viet-cong/"">Viet Cong</a>, where they work alongside Scott Munro (from Women producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4533-chad-vangaalen/"">Chad VanGaalen</a>'s band) and guitarist Daniel Christiansen. ""<i>Cassette""</i> is their scrappy introduction to the world; it’s the sound of parts congealing but not yet feeding off one another, as you might expect from something originally put out as a tour-only release. Now it's been buffed up and cleaned out, and with <a href=""http://www.mexicansummer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mexican Summer</a> behind it and Women’s reputation on their backs, it’s no longer the low-key intro it may have been conceived as during the band’s formation.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There’s something welcoming and likeable about ""<i>Cassette""</i>, from the awkward lurches in style to the desire to stick something out that’s less than fully formed. Women certainly didn’t operate that way, instead creating a world full of chilly remove. Viet Cong appear to be systematically lessening that bite and opening themselves up to their audience, although traces of their former selves remain. It's a process of steadily rinsing out the old to get to somewhere new. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16781-viet-cong-bunker-buster-rough-mix/"">“Bunker Buster”</a> (not included on this release), the nascent Viet Cong impaled themselves on jagged guitar lines, lost monotone vocals, and lines where they “slowly fall through the snow.” So far, so familiar, but there have been changes since then, some of which hint at a future for this band that could outstrip anything that came before.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Viet Cong's songs are complex puzzles. It’s like they hear the direction a song is going in and then purposefully take a step in a different direction, and from that place they try to figure out the least obvious way to get back to where they started. The thrill of listening to them is in hearing how they deliberately hurl obstacles in front of themselves while trying to maintain a sense of forward momentum. “Throw It Away”, one of their strongest songs, begins as a ringer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1002-the-damned/"">the Damned</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTfyUqVqX-0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“New Rose”</a> before diverting into knotty math-rock guitar lines and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/685-wendy-carlos/"">Wendy Carlos</a>-inspired synth drones. On “Throw It Away” and the similarly clattering “Oxygen Feed”, they’re stern, frantic, driven by a need to get right up in people's faces. Women’s music was sometimes so out of reach it felt like an intrusion to be in the same room as them; in contrast, Viet Cong thrive on audience-performer conflict.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/307-bauhaus/"">Bauhaus</a>’ “Dark Entries”, which sounds like a live recording, is a peak for the nihilistic streak that cuts deep into this band. It’s their most forthright performance, strung somewhere between garage rock and straight punk but with a weirdo edge simmering over the top, recalling the mixture of studied mannerisms and unhinged damage that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/779-clinic/"">Clinic</a> could produce at their peak circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1513-internal-wrangler/""><i>Internal Wrangler</i></a>. When Viet Cong deviate from the bloody path there are mixed results. In placid mode they get back to Women’s altered-states take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">the Beach Boys</a>, which was never that band’s strongest look (“Static Wall”); and the attempt at digging up cold wave synth tones and substituting fury for furrowed brow crooning is best forgotten (“Structureless Design”). It’s in those moments that the original intent behind this EP comes bruising back into view—it’s the sound of a group of people finding their way, testing out ideas, sketching out the little details but not coloring in the bigger picture just yet.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What ""<i>Cassette""</i> ultimately does is throw down a set of directions Viet Cong could head in and allow us to sit back and wonder which will be the strongest thread. As a glimpse of what a band could be it’s fascinating, especially as the songs leave the impression of a group with strong personalities in the mix, all determined to leave a stamp on the music they make. Flegel and Munro have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9353-viet-cong/"">talked</a> about their day jobs, in flooring and cupcake delivery, respectively. At their best, the band reads as a group of people trying to make beautiful and extraordinary art rise from mundane circumstances. On ""<i>Cassette""</i> they’re halfway there, feeling out designs, seeing what sticks, nixing what doesn’t. This is a picture of the process of making music, with all its flaws and triumphs intact. </p></div>"|19495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19495-viet-cong-cassette-ep/|7.8|Nick Neyland

It’s built into the band and reflected in their name; they’re allstars because they play in other groups. Five, to be exact, each representing the electric street music of a different ethnicity. They are a cultural melting pot, blending the hovering guitars of Congolese pop music with heavy percussion, electrified likembes (thumb pianos), a couple of different vocal styles, and a seemingly sharp awareness of the way they’re perceived abroad as much as a story as a band.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i>Beware the Fetish</i> is their second Western release, produced by Vincent Kenis, and it is a sprawling document, clocking in at an hour and 42 minutes. It is, to state the obvious, not the right entry point into the <i>Congotronics</i> series (the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2384-konono-n1/"" target=""_blank"">Konono N°1</a> album probably deserves that distinction), but it offers a lot to explore for anyone looking for more of the peculiar buzz and rumble that characterizes the series. While past entries in the series, including this group’s debut, have had the feel of albums or compilations with carefully honed structures, this one is about as immersive an experience as you’d expect something almost two hours long to be. It’s a well-curated field recording, for all intents, capturing the band in action as it explores its own sound.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">This leads to some arresting moments. “As They Walked Into the Forest on a Sunday, They Encountered Apes Dressed as Humans” somehow lives up to its title, the likembes, xylophones and hand drums building into a dark and knotty groove. On nearly every track, the elements of the song move around in the mix as though the microphone is exploring the room to get a different angle on the proceedings. Vocals drift to the forefront and then fall back to reveal a cycling guitar figure or a fuzz-toned likembe. It’s an almost diagrammatic approach to sound; different parts of the diagram shed light on different details.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Listeners shouldn’t come looking for alternative takes on funk and rock, or even anything like a punchy song or arrangement. Those things are all expectations we map onto this music, and none of them are anything like the point of this record. This is an album that asks you to sink into its sounds, takes a left every time you expect it to take a right and moves slowly most of the time, letting things happen rather than forcing them. It’s not quite like anything else, including the other <i>Congotronics</i> releases.</p></div>"|19557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19557-kasai-allstars-beware-the-fetish/|7.2|Joe Tangari

<p class=""p1"">His new album, which sees Britt assuming the name Fhloston Paradigm as a full-on alias, revisits and fleshes out the same territory as the EP, which functioned as a kind of alternate soundtrack to Luc Besson’s pop-art sci-fi flick <i>The Fifth Element</i> (the name Fhloston Paradigm itself originated with “Fhloston Paradise,” the futuristic resort Bruce Willis’ character visits in the film.) It’s a concept that recalls not only the Afrofuturist tendencies of early techno, but the heady positivity of '90s pop culture, when science fiction trafficked more in sensory manipulation than dystopian paranoia. Britt carries it off with a sonic precision that can be dazzling, but at times strays into territory that feels blinkered by nostalgia.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The menacing, back-to-basics EP cut “Chasing Rainbows” reappears,<i> </i>and its slowly downshifting melody remains the most memorable earworm here. The rest of <i>The Phoenix </i>distances itself from the gear-grinding analog techno of the EP, applying that track’s mutant-pop gravitas as a schematic for something more dramatic. The production sounds more expensive, and the arrangements more elaborate, with six of the tracks featuring guest vocalists.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As a producer, Britt is in fine form here, and listening to the album on a good pair of headphones reveals truly beautiful details—the expressive drumming on “Letters of Past”, the subtle, woozy dissonance that emerges from the immersive clouds of album closer “Light on Edge”. Surprisingly, Britt’s melodic sense is easier to appreciate on the fully instrumental tracks—see the icy synth lines on the dizzying “Race to the Moon”, an early highlight. By contrast, the sung melodies sound simplistic, and when there are discernible lyrics, they’re more distracting than atmospheric. It’s hard to hear Natasha Kmeto’s appearance on “Light on Edge” without thinking of Fhloston Paradigm’s fantastic, seductive <a href=""http://youtu.be/46fm3bdpbbg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of her track “Deeply”, which saw him embellishing around a straightforward vocal line to hypnotic effect.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The pinnacle of the album comes on the nine-minute title track, its mutating rumble of drums and ominous chords anchoring a teased-out jumble of synth notes that eventually emerges as a bee-sting-precise melody. There’s nothing more absorbing on the album, or sweeter on the ears. It’s a massive-sounding elaboration on burnt-out techno, and inventive enough to explain why a somewhat backward-looking project would find a home on Hyperdub, a label that’s always seeking to push dance music into the future.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Unfortunately, the rest of <i>The Phoenix </i>has a tendency towards the anodyne, a flaw that lies more in the languorous composition than the execution. “Tension Remains”, which features operatic vocals from Pia Ercole, sounds like a fairly explicit call-back to Besson’s famous blue-skinned diva, but <i>The Phoenix </i>lacks the narrative quality to make it anything more than an amusing reference. The album<i> </i>is also an hour long—short by film score standards, but for an album with several leisurely ambient stretches, it’s a commitment to sit through. Fhloston Paradigm’s continued association with <i>The Fifth Element</i> makes sense: that film’s vision of the future was more concerned with the surface-level pleasures of gaudy costumes and kinetic choreography than developing a deeper subtext. <i>The Phoenix </i>is a similar beast, simultaneously muscular and fluffy, a well-polished album that sometimes feels perplexingly one-dimensional.</p></div>"|19499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19499-fhloston-paradigm-the-phoenix/|6.7|Abby Garnett

Unsurprisingly, the trio’s debut LP is haunted by the most recognizable junkie of folklore, the vampire—just peep the inclusion of both “The Vampire” and “Vampir” on the tracklist and its cover, which would look mighty fine on the front of a high school goth's Trapper Keeper in 1992. And they indeed have a nostalgic, youthful idea of how vampires and indie rock should interact—think “Nosferatu Man” and “Bela Lugosi’s Dead”, and forget Stephenie Meyer ever happened. As such, nothing about <i>What Moon Things</i> is sexy, cute or dashing; instead, these eight anti-romantic horror stories find a band who's fanged, emaciated and out for blood.</p>
<p>What Moon Things developed their doddering, incommunicado sound in New Paltz, New York, a place that's isolated even by the standards of the other isolated Empire State outposts that have made major contributions to indie rock in 2014—it’s about three hours from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31732-perfect-pussy"">Perfect Pussy</a>’s homebase of Syracuse, about half that from the SUNY Purchase enclave that has abetted NYC’s minor explosion of folk weirdos. You might think What Moon Things was part of the latter scene, seeing as how Harms’ voice is almost indistinguishable from that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31108-porches"">Porches.</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31974-frankie-cosmos"">Frankie Cosmos</a>’ Aaron Maine; his singing is off-key but on-point, a desperate yelp from an unstable man, though the assumed squalor makes you think of a guy trapped in a well rather than a dive bar.</p>
<p>Cooperstown and Queens are about equidistant from New Paltz and if What Moon Things didn't drive upstate to see the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"">Modest Mouse</a> and Brand New co-headlining show that took place earlier this year, I guarantee they'll head to the city for the one in August. And I guarantee they hoped the former played nothing from after 2000 and the latter played nothing prior to 2006. What Moon Things tease out the similarities between those responsible for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjPyvoLXPs4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Jesus Christ”</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeUBJmlC8us"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Jesus Christ Was an Only Child”</a>: for one thing, a protagonist who narrates with an uneasy, medicated or even kinda alien worldview. Either way, something’s just <i>off</i> about the guy and he functions more as a slightly removed observer of life than a participant. </p>
<p>The connection is also played out in Harms' guitars; befitting his name, nothing here is strummed or caressed. He fills out the spaces of <i>What Moon Things</i> with palm-muted clean riffs, gnarled note clusters, and pinched harmonics flanged out to be slightly sharp. John Morisi plays with a similarly effective anti-technique; his disregard for actual timekeeping and proclivity to just hit every single piece of his kit as hard as possible would drive a drum teacher insane. Only the quasi-title track keeps the same tempo throughout its entirety and that’s only because it’s a one-minute instrumental. Abetted by the dry, stark production, every drum thwack is the sound of metal hitting bone and flesh, the lack of decay echoing the shock of seeing someone actually get <i>injured</i>. Harms’ vocals and odd melodic sense ensure <i>What Moon Things</i> sticks; Morisi ensures that you hear them differently every time.</p>
<p>Within the context of <i>What Moon Things</i>, the physical musicianship draws out an underlying potential for violence in Harms’ downcast demeanor. He sings of vampires when he’s more of a zombie, a zoned-out, single-minded half-human. “Get you” is notably spelled as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4TxczzLpnc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“getchoo” </a>in the lyrics sheet and that should give you an indication of where Harms <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14817-pinkerton-deluxe-edition-death-to-false-metal/"">often goes mentally</a> to source the pathetic, needy nature of male heartbreak: “I’m such an adult/ With high school stuck in my head”; “I see your face on every girl”. “Staring at the Radio” is the one time he’s actually able to get out of the house and it’s only to sit in a car, waiting for the battery to die; the title itself twists a common trope to be even more fucking piteous, like he can’t even handle the visual stimuli of television.</p>
<p>What Moon Things describe the totality of this sound as “dreamo”, which I believe was a phrase first coined by non-descript <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/154-at-the-drive-in"">At the Drive-In</a> offshoot <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3904-sparta"">Sparta</a>; What Moon Things sound nothing like Sparta and Sparta sounded nothing like particularly atmospheric emo. What they mean to say is that they like both shoegaze and emo, two genres which really don’t intersect as much as one would expect; both are concerned with conveying a <i>feeling</i>, but the former stresses sensual implication, the latter articulation. What Moon Things aren’t very “dreamo” either: their shoegaze isn’t pretty, as the gaseous, suffocating “Doesn’t Make Much Sense” and “Squirrel Girl” finds Harms’ head in an oven rather than the clouds.</p>
<p>While fine pieces of exhaust pipe ambience, those two songs are less intriguing than the striking minimalism of “The Vampire” and “The Astronaut”, proof that What Moon Things benefit from directness and concision. This much is evidenced in <i>What Moon Things</i> potentially qualifying as one of the strongest EPs of the year, but it’s a full-length that may have been forced against its will to get there. The consecutive sequencing of its two most distorted tracks, the instrumental and the near-reprise of “Vampir” verge on introducing redundancy to a very short record. Still, the rousing closer “Son, Where’s the Fire” makes a great case for What Moon Things’ promise rather than their limitations; the group chorus is the only true extroverted, urgent moment, and it gives an compelling voice to a cosmic teenage demand to take the power back: “Sun, where’s the fucking fire?” After all, What Moon Things recognize the world is a vampire, sent to drain.</p></div>"|19579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19579-what-moon-things-what-moon-things/|7.3|Ian Cohen

A new collaboration between production duo Astma &amp; Rocwell and singer Stina Wäppling, the Swedish trio gestures toward the otherworldly moodiness of more adventurous electronic artists from their corner of the world. The group's debut <i>We Are Only What We Feel</i> is full of the kind of itchy beatwork that populated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30799-m/"" target=""_blank"">MØ</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">'s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19050-m-no-mythologies-to-follow/"" target=""_blank""><i>No Mythologies to Follow</i></a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> earlier this year, but falls even further from the Scandinavian equilibrium of terror and pleasure best embodied in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a>'s early work.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">NONONO hold onto a distinctly West Coast optimism on their first LP, cutting a closer kinship to their future tourmates Foster the People or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1006-the-dandy-warhols/"" target=""_blank"">the Dandy Warhols</a> than any of the iconic electro-pop artists whose trappings they channel. Slick and shallow, the production on tracks like ""Jungle"" pairs a software-preset's take on ""tribal"" drums with guitar strokes so tight it's impossible to tell if they ever shook out of a real instrument. Advance single ""Pumpin Blood"" moves from a two-note intro borrowed from Snow Patrol into a chorus that wants so badly to be joyful, but leans entirely on the whistlecore that unraveled when Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros' ""Home"" got its two-thousandth play on Clear Channel.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The songs here wear happy on their skin, but start to take on the quality of a smile held too long to be natural. Wäppling sings ""Pumpin Blood"" like it's more of an earworm than it is, enunciating lyrics that don't do much besides reiterate anatomical fact: ""It's your heart/ It's alive/ It's pumping blood."" In a Knife song, the words might come through almost as a threat, rife with irony. Pasted onto this song's bare, obvious melody, they feel forgettably thin.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Though <i>We Are Only What We Feel </i>plods through similar tempos and uniform textures, Wäppling sings with enough character to keep the record from fading into the background. On ""Like The Wind"", she counters clumsy percussion with an unsettling squawk that does more to divide time than the beat. Against a staid piano arpeggio and bizarrely mismatched fuzz bass, her head voice strains with longing through the chorus of ""Echo"". At times, it feels like Wäppling is even fighting against her collaborators; ""Down Under"" punctuates her lines with a cheap sci-fi arpeggio, like Astma &amp; Rocwell wanted to insist upon their presence as real producers of real electronic music.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Maybe there's an idiomatic rift at play here—it could be that Swedish is a language less inundated with poetry about the heart and its zest for life—but it seems more likely than NONONO started to feel comfortable before they felt confident. Very little in the album speaks to risk or discovery. The patches are the same ones that scatter throughout Soundcloud under the hands of kids trying Ableton for the first time, while the lyrics don't strive for much beyond #poetry. More than complacency, I hear a gridlock. Wäppling and her producers seem to be staring at each other from across an unproductive vacancy, not generating new ideas from their discrepancies, but playing in their own worlds, barely communicating.</p></div>"|19524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19524-nonono-we-are-only-what-we-feel/|5.8|Sasha Geffen

His decades-long history of groundbreaking electronic music had a lot to do with Warp even existing at all, so the fact he was going to be working with the imprint known for taking the torch in the 1990s and 2000s brought dreams of great things. Lost in the excitement was the memory that Eno had for a number of years been making low-key records that made little impact outside of his cult. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2808-another-day-on-earth/""><i>Another Day on Earth</i></a> from 2005, his first song-based solo album in many years, had some <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxOCdRdYzZw&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">memorable songs,</a> and his 2008 pairing with David Byrne, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12151-everything-that-happens-will-happen-today/""><i>Everything Happens Today</i></a>, found an audience. But ’90s and ’00s instrumental releases like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2794-drawn-from-life-with-j-peter-schwalm/""><i>Drawn From Life</i></a>, <i>The Drop</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2795-neroli/""><i>Neroli</i></a>, and <i>The Shutov Assembly</i> didn’t come close to entering his canon. The Warp signing obscured the fact that Eno always had more than his share of uneven records, in part because he’s never been the sort of artist interested in perfection. So the fact that four of the records and collaborations released on Warp have ranged from a lovely retread of familiar ground (2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17303-lux/""><i>Lux</i></a>) to eminently forgettable collaborations (the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16005-panic-of-looking/"">two</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15598-drums-between-the-bells/"">records</a> with poet Rick Holland, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19313-brian-eno-karl-hyde-someday-world/"">first</a> with Underworld’s Karl Hyde) should surprise nobody.</p>
<p><i>High Life</i>, though, is a genuine surprise. As the second meeting between Eno and Hyde in the last four months, it would have been reasonable to expect outtakes, another set of OK half-songs to accompany the ones released earlier this year. But <i>High Life</i>—recorded in just five days, with much of it played and processed live—is something else altogether. This is Eno’s best vocal album in 25 years, since his 1990 collaboration with John Cale, <i>Wrong Way Up</i>. It’s interesting to go back that far because <i>High Life</i> has a few things in common with that record, most prominently the elements inspired by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj51BMoh91I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pop music</a> from the African continent. Yes, this is a recurring obsession of Eno’s, dating back at least to his first co-billed collaboration with David Byrne, 1981’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1064-my-life-in-the-bush-of-ghosts/""><i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i></a>. But on <i>High Life</i> it’s again made explicit, from the title (Highlife is a broad genre of jazz-inflected West African pop music that emerged late in the last century) on down.</p>
<p>That said, many of the references are less musical and more textural, and guitars are the first thing you notice. The opening “Return” is nine minutes of drone-guitar bliss, as Karl Hyde strums two chords furiously with the sort of pinched, trebly, delay-heavy tone that evokes both West African styles and the Edge circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13654-the-unforgettable-fire-deluxe-edition/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>The Unforgettable Fire</i></a>. The tension of pivoting between those two chords without resolution is softened by Eno’s voice, which he layers into sturdy central melody softened by billowing harmonies. It’s the kind of blindingly simple thing that nobody does better than Eno, and it points to why this record towers over much of his recent output—it <i>sounds</i> analog, like people in a room playing who could make mistakes. Despite his technological pedigree, Eno has always been most inspired by the place where abstract mathematics meet the messiness of nature. His earlier collaborative efforts on Warp, as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14828-small-craft-on-a-milk-sea/""><i>Small Craft on a Milk Sea</i></a>, felt like records where meaning was carved from endless possibility; <i>High Life</i> shows how much more he can wring out of just a handful of ideas.</p>
<p>If I’m leaning heavily toward Eno’s contributions here, it’s because so many of his songwriting and production signatures are in the foreground. Hyde is the guitarist throughout the record, but Eno’s fingerprints are all over his approach. “DBF” is a relatively upbeat track with a chicken scratch-funk feel that makes me think of Talking Heads’ “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilcD1fHcGB0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Born Under Punches</a>”, while the slow and dreamy line in “Time to Waste It” brings to mind an ’80s interpretation of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SliSy9j3iIo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King Sunny Ade</a>. But we’re talking about something more than just a collection of global music signifiers here—influences are stripped down, transformed, and often turned into something disorienting and strange through Eno’s processing. “Time to Waste It” has pinched, warped, and ultimately very weird vocals of uncertain origin which seem to be singing lead from different songs with each new line. “Lilac”’s overlapping guitar lines have the frenetic pulse of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TKVpUSWCug"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">classical minimalism</a>, with odd bleeps and squawks mixing in with the chords, and they’re contrasted with the richly harmonized vocals, which remind us how in tune he is with the <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97320958"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pure joy of singing</a>.</p>
<p>That big-hearted spirit is embedded into the record as a whole. I count one dud among the six tracks, the just-OK “Moulded Life”, which has some nice sounds but feels a bit like processing-for-processing’s-sake. But that is more than redeemed by the elegiac closer “Cells &amp; Bells”, where grinding Fennesz-like electronics are set against a mass of voices singing a dark but faintly hopeful prayer. It’s a moving end to a startling and inspiring record. Eno’s been involved with quite a few of those in the past, but it’s especially nice to experience a new one that reaches us in the present moment.</p></div>"|19539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19539-brian-eno-karl-hyde-high-life/|8.5|Mark Richardson

When the band broke up in 2002 following the departure of bassist G.C. Green, its death seemed final. Justin Broadrick fell into a depression, canceling their tour and rarely leaving the house, ultimately solidifying the group's passing in a promotional poster for his next project that proclaimed : “Godflesh is dead. Long live Jesu.” But here comes Broadrick more than a dozen years later, wizened by his years spent making post-rock and, with Green back in tow, promising an LP and an EP from Godflesh in 2014. They return with <i>Decline</i><i> and Fall</i>, a four-track show of force that laughs off any notions that they've fallen off.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Godflesh’s metal machine music resurfaces at a time where satellites and fiber optics networks muffle the once-unchallenged roars of factory machines. The production of <i>Decline and Fall </i>could be heard as band’s protest against the sanitization of these industrial sounds. Godflesh remain fiercely loyal to lo-fi, treating songs like as caustic exercises in overstimulation. “Ringer” stirs up shivers by way of a direct confrontation with mechanical chaos: the drums lock into a dull, arrythmic throb picked up by the grizzled bass, leaving Broadrick to embellish the din with a combination of throaty growls and slightly soured singing. In turn, “Playing With Fire” welds these rotting melodies together into grating harmonies that attract and repel in equal measure.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Elsewhere, Godflesh reach for the crunchy industrial rock of their prime: half of the EP remains entrenched in rhythmic, bass-heavy metal that some listeners have preemptively dubbed “Kornflesh.” This pejorative, of course, ignores the appropriation of the band’s hybridized sound by more palatable commercial artists such as Faith No More (whose invitation to join Broadrick turned down), Fear Factory, and yes, Korn. At the same time, it captures what makes gnarled jams like “Dogbite” so compelling: namely, that Godflesh can return from a 12-year absence—long after the demise of nu-metal, for that matter—having perfected and refined the style of their co-opters. Such a reclamation manifests itself in “Dog Bite” in the form of a thick, sludgy guitar hook that stomps along to form a rowdy groove, an approach they take again on the title track, this time with a greater emphasis on the drum machine for an unexpected hit of hip-hop.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Avant and yet strangely accessible, industrially-minded but all-embracing, <i>Decline and Fall </i>confirms that a decade-plus-long absence has dulled neither Godflesh’s industrial spirit, nor their devotion to experimentation. Will they be able to sustain that line of energy for an entire album? That question must go unanswered until the release of <i>A World Lit Only By Fire, </i>the band's first full-length since 2001. </p></div>"|19482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19482-godflesh-decline-and-fall-ep/|7.9|Zoe Camp

It took place in Manhattan at an established nightclub with four DJs at the helm. In just under a calendar year, it came under the control of Justin Carter and Eamon Harkin and relocated out to Brooklyn, where for the past five years the party has hewed closer to the DIY spaces like 285 Kent, Market Hotel and Silent Barn than any sleek dance club, moving to barely legal warehouse and loft spaces throughout the borough. The party took in Saturday as well as Sunday and for the first few years of Mister Sunday, it hosted a wide range of DJ guests: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12425-sound-sculptures-volume-1"">Theo Parrish</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17254-mantasy/"">Michael Mayer</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5477-trouser-jazz/"">Mr. Scruff</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19016-optimo-dark-was-the-night/"">Optimo</a>, to name but a few headliners.</p>
<p>As the party grew in popularity, though, it no longer needed to rely on international DJ guests, instead emphasizing the wide-ranging sets of local hosts Carter and Harkin. And when the duo started the <a href=""http://mistersaturdaynight.com/category/mister-saturday-night-records/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mister Saturday Night</a> imprint back in spring of 2012, they emphasized homegrown talent across their first few vinyl-only releases. But as this 2xCD (or 3xLP) label compilation <i>Brothers and Sisters</i> makes evident, Mister Saturday Night is at once local and international, with artists both in their backyard and in countries like Scotland and Japan.</p>
<p>The set opens with “In Brackets” by Dark Sky, a trio of producers who touched on a few genres over releases across a variety of labels before dropping this decidedly house single for MSN. “In Brackets” builds from silky pads and a crisp 120 BPM beat, a shimmering yet wistful melody twining around the track. Another Brooklyn trio, Archie Pelago, follows with “Brown Oxford”, one of four tracks on the set; despite having one of the most cringeworthy names in recent memory, the jazz-steeped, Ableton-dabbling trio stay<i> just</i> this side of mushroom jazz. Their eight-minute compilation closer “Frederyck Swerl” brings to mind of Terry Riley’s looping soprano saxophone pieces, but there's always a moment in their tracks where I wish it was less about chops and trickiness and more about serving the track at hand.</p>
<p>Jazzy flourishes tend to derail some of the music here and the tracks that stand out are those that overlap with fellow Brooklyn imprint, L.I.E.S., embracing the noisy side of current dance music. Gunnar Haslem’s glowering “Let A Hundred Flowers Bloom” is one obvious example, since he himself is a L.I.E.S. alum, but it also holds true for newcomers like Brooklynite Hank Jackson and Okayama-based producer Keita Sano. Their squalling contributions Jackson's “Cole’s Lullaby” and Sano's “People Are Changing”—taken alongside some L.I.E.S. releases and the abrasive <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=14149"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Feral Grind</i> comp</a> from late last year—posit a parallel world where the most influential dance act to hail from the DFA catalog in the past decade was Black Dice, not LCD Soundsystem.</p>
<p>Other tracks do woozy Balearic (Lumigraph’s “Yacht Cruiser”), distorted tribal weirdness (General Ludd’s “C”), or cinematic strings-laced house (Alex Burkat’s “Shower Scene”), some of which have made for noisy and effective highlights in mixes from the likes of adventurous DJs like Ben UFO and James Holden. So while there may not be one overriding aesthetic or scene-specific sound to <i>Brothers and</i> <i>Sisters</i>, the comp emulates the party itself: not always cohesive but always inclusive. </p></div>"|19577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19577-various-artists-brothers-sisters/|7.9|Andy Beta

Frontman Jared Artaud just <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=jared%20artaud%20empty%20space"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">released a poetry book</a>, and if his last name seems familiar, it's because he cribbed it from the French poet <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Artaud"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Antonin Artaud</a>. When they perform, psychedelic images are projected onto to the band. Their new album's companion tape <i>Arrival</i> features artwork by <a href=""http://ausgangart.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Ausgang</a>, who did the cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"">MGMT</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14122-congratulations/""><i>Congratulations</i></a>. The ""cool factor"" with this band is palpable, even it's largely been attained through nostalgic associations.</p>
<p>After the promising 2011 single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12081-confusion/"">""Confusion""</a>, the trick for the Vacant Lots is to add authority to their psychedelic street cred with a solid album. <i>Departure</i>, a record bogged down in repetitive melodies, doesn't get there. The album opens with a bleating, attention-grabbing synth hook on ""Mad Mary Jones"", but you won't find many aberrations or change-ups beyond that. Even when percussion and guitar come in to take the song in a new direction, it becomes another unvarying parallel road alongside that initial synth refrain. Most of these songs follow a hook a little too far and, sometimes, like on ""Paint This City"", they slog through slower, still repetitive material. The vocals, often monotonous with several choruses only offering a handful of repeated and deadpanned words, don't help. At times, Artaud recites the lyrics, slow and drab, as poems. They may read well on the page, but as songs, they come over as hollow psychedelic blather, with lines like, ""The void filled by a penetrating eye with an electric pupil."" </p>
<p>Still, this album can't be written off purely as a repetitive mess—this is the sound they were going for, after all, and when they rely less heavily on repetition, drones, and electronics, they find some decent material. Take the tambourine on ""Before the Evening's Thru"", which roots them in an earlier era of psychedelia. It's a small thing, but the percussion pairs well with their persistent electronic warble, which is mixed and mastered beautifully by Sonic Boom. And it was a great call to get Wareham on guitar for ""Tomorrow"", which has one of the album's best hooks and, following the verse, a fantastic shift in texture that brings to mind Michael Rother or Utopia-era Todd Rundgren. But those occasional flare-ups and moments of potential are exceptions on an album that needs <i>anything</i> to happen more frequently.</p></div>"|19569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19569-the-vacant-lots-departure/|5.2|Evan Minsker

Sure, </span><span>t</span>he members took separate, circuitous paths to arrive in the New York all-star quintet, with individual stops in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4yCEMjTXv0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Electric Wizard</a>, <a href=""http://unearthlytrance1.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unearthly Trance</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ramesses</a> and <a href=""http://thehowlingwind.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Howling Wind</a> along the way; by definition, that’s true of most every supergroup. But on their self-titled 2012 debut, Serpentine Path showcased an unwavering focus, marching through eight barbaric bits of doom at very low tempos and with very little distraction. They occasionally decorated songs with spooky samples as preludes and sometimes let guitarist Tim Bagshaw step out of rhythmic lockstep for slow, swollen solos. Mostly, though, they pressed ahead, with Ryan Lipynsky’s bellicose rasp peeking through the band’s deliberate plod, a dim lantern lighting the way through a darkened forest. In spite of the extensive résumés of those involved, Serpentine Path established a purpose and pursued it doggedly, avoiding the most general pitfall of veteran talent aggregates: indecision.</p>
<p>In the last two years, Serpentine Path haven’t veered from that course, but they have added a fifth member and second guitarist, Winter co-founder Stephen Flam. On <i>Emanations</i>, Flam lends finesse to that focus, giving their doom a new depth. Flam refuses to mirror or retrench the burl of Bagshaw’s riffs; instead, they work together to add underlying layers to the brood, with lines of dissonant squeal and sordid distortion peeling off of the group’s headlong direction. The distinction becomes clear only a minute in to <i>Emanations</i>, when a brief break in Lipynsky’s arrogant agitation allows the guitars to split at the seams—one snarling and thin, the other thick and suffocating. For Serpentine Path, Flam introduces a new element of the unknown, and the established group responds in kind for the entire album. They disrupt rhythms where they once would have stayed in time, and they break patterns that, only two years ago, felt settled. If <i>Serpentine Path</i> were a declaration of intent, <i>Emanations </i>is an attempt to steer clear of its rut, to make sure that the supergroup’s core doesn’t become deadweight.</p>
<p>Serpentine Path haven't given up on doom, or even steered from it, really. These seven songs still feel like leaden hammers swung by giants. “Disfigured Colossus” is enormous and odd, grisly guitar tones twisted over an imposing rhythm section. “Torment” is an italicized attack, its mid-tempo lurch aiming ever ahead. Throughout <i>Emanations</i>, though, Serpentine Path find subtle, compelling ways to scatter that power, to accompany their force so it never seems to be the sole purpose. “Treacherous Waters”, for instance, flips between an insistent lumber and double-kick bursts, the switches in tempo reinforcing the dour temperament of Lipynsky’s lyrics. “Drawn into the depths,” he bellows after one of those changeups, the band surging beneath him. “Vacant incantations.” And “Torment"", that closing fisticuff, zigs and zags, pushing through a bridge bent by a bleary-eyed guitar soliloquy and ending with glorious guitar harmonies. That push and pull between insurgence and excursions is most evident on “Systematic Extinction”, a fetching stoner anthem that moves Serpentine Path the farthest afield from their stylistic center that they’ve ever been. Flam and Bagshaw step out for solos between every verse and chorus, lysergic tones spinning into a slow, psychedelic pinwheel. With its stack of refrains and bridges, pregnant stop-time pauses and careful crescendo crest, it’s the most consciously crafted song in Serpentine Path’s catalogue.</p>
<p>On a song like “Systematic Extinction”, you can feel Serpentine Path pressing against their previous limitations by folding their members’ respective experiences back into their own stylistic rubric. More often than not, supergroups seem to take the opposite tack, starting from the ideas that made the musicians successful in the past and, with time, possibly finding a distinction all their own. On their debut, Serpentine Path decided how they would sound and what they would ply; on <i>Emanations</i>, they’ve used that starting point as a real beginning, the origin of a path from which they can move off and on at will.<i> </i></p></div>"|19393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19393-serpentine-path-emanations/|7.7|Grayson Haver Currin

For example: “If you’re a guy and you ask me when’s my record coming out on vinyl, I’ll kick the shit out of you. If you’re a girl, I’ll talk to you for an hour about it.”  Or: “Are you getting tired of these middle-aged ramblings of mine? Because I’m going to do a lot more of them.” And: “When I was young, in my 20s, they’d tell me I looked like Matt Dillon. And then I get into my 30s, and I cut my hair short, they told me I looked like John Malkovich. And now I’m fucking 47, and girls don’t even talk to me anymore. It sucks.” (This is to say nothing of the <i>True Detective</i> season recap Kozelek offers partway through.) But Kozelek saves his biggest howler for the end, when prior to the closing lullaby “Elaine”, he says with a straight face, “this one’s from my record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16674-among-the-leaves/"" target=""_blank""><i>Among the Leaves</i></a>—old album. <i>Old</i> album.”</div>
<p>For those who haven’t been keeping score, Kozelek has been making records for 22 years now. <i>Among the Leaves</i>—his fifth proper album under the alias <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Kil Moon</a>—came out a mere 22 months before this Biko performance. But, as the old saying goes, Kozelek’s quip is funny because it’s true. Since <i>Among the Leaves</i>, Kozelek has issued a covers collection (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17626-mark-kozelek-live-at-phoenix-public-house-melbournelike-rats/"">Like Rats</a></i>), full-album collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/48-the-album-leaf/"" target=""_blank"">the Album Leaf</a>’s Jimmy LaVelle (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17960-the-album-leaf-sun-kil-moon-perils-from-the-sea/"">Perils From the Sea</a></i>) and San Fran rockers Desertshore (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18363-desertshore-mark-kozelek-and-desertshore/"">Mark Kozelek &amp; Desertshore</a></i>), a soundtrack to a documentary (<i>On Tour</i>), not to mention at least five live limited-edition live records. But the distance between <i>Among the Leaves</i> and 2014 feels all the more vast in light of this year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18860-sun-kil-moon-benji/"">Benji</a></i>, a career high watermark that managed to pack a lifetime’s worth of familial grieving, bittersweet nostalgia, celebrity namedrops, and CNN Breaking News headlines into its one-hour running time.</p>
<p>An album that puts the “me” in “meta,” <i>Benji</i> is so dense with intensely personal history that it practically necessitates drawing up a Kozelek family tree and consulting a map of Ohio to follow along. But for all its inter-song connections, <i>Benji</i> is ultimately an anti-concept album, a song cycle whose connections are less the result of a grand narrative than a comment on the uncontrollably random yet cruelly cyclical nature of life. And, in light of Kozelek’s faded public profile, it proved to be a resounding comeback effort from a guy who seemed so resigned to his fate as the cultiest of cult artists that, just last year, he was compelled to write a song called “Hey You Bastards I’m Still Here”. Granted, that’s a Steve McQueen quote from ""Papillion""—Kozelek’s all-time favorite movie, we learn on <i>Live at Biko</i>—but the sentiment perfectly defines Kozelek’s temperament these days: perennially disillusioned with the mind-numbing, ceiling-gazing drudgery of small-scale touring, but still emboldened by the intimate connection he has with the audience that remains. (As he sums up toward the end of the set: “I want to thank the people from Biko, who’ve been wonderful and cooked me some really great food … thanks to everybody for being so polite, I’m having a good fucking time. Now I’ve got to go to Scandinavia and eat really shitty food.”)</p>
<p>But <i>Live at Biko</i> is more than just another vault-clearing quickie to keep the diehards satiated. Most of Kozelek’s recent live releases have featured grab-bag setlists, complementing his Sun Kil Moon repertoire with samples from his canyon-deep arsenal of covers and even the odd Red House Painters classic. The <i>Live at Biko</i> set, by contrast, focuses squarely on Kozelek’s post-2010 songbook, and thus functions as both a tidy summation of an especially prolific period in his career, as well as a snapshot of how he’s evolved from one of indie-rock’s most enigmatic figures to its greatest oversharer. And with Kozelek adapting his ambient-electronic excursions with LaVelle and electric-guitar jams with Desertshore to the solo-nylon-acoustic mode of the most recent Sun Kil Moon records, we see a clearer path through his winding discography en route to the staggering peaks of <i>Benji</i>.</p>
<p>At the same time, when placed alongside Kozelek’s preceding work, you can hear why <i>Benji</i> has struck a deeper chord with people who've never really engaged with his music before, or hadn't in years. As <i>Live at Biko</i> illustrates, <i>Benji</i> was hardly the first time Kozelek had crafted a tragic character study about a fleeting acquaintance (“Gustavo”), commented on the thankless plight of the fortysomething working musician (“Sunshine in Chicago”), eulogized a dead relative (“Ceiling Gazing”), or relayed a deep-seated memory through pop-cultural color commentary (“Tavoris Cloud”) or a beloved old film (“Hey You Bastards I’m Still Here”). But where those songs feel like wistful internal monologues, the <i>Benji</i> tracks featured here—particularly the bloody-knuckled performances of “Richard Ramirez Died Today of Natural Causes”, “I Watched the Film the Song Remains the Same”, and “Dogs”—are more like exorcisms, as if decades of pent-up anxieties and insecurities were finally being unleashed through a ceaseless stream of words that threaten to overwhelm the songs’ structures. His unflinching candor has been matched with do-or-die ardor.</p>
<p>But where <i>Benji</i>’s lyrics have a rambling, made-up-on-the-spot quality, <i>Live at Biko</i> reinforces just how architecturally intricate they actually are—as emphasized by Kozelek’s remarkable ability to remember <a href=""http://rock.rapgenius.com/Sun-kil-moon-richard-ramirez-died-today-of-natural-causes-lyrics"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">entire 70-line songs</a> without flubbing a single word. And <i>Live at Biko</i> is quick to remind us that <i>Benji</i> is as much a comedy as tragedy, at times forcefully so: After the cheeky reference to albino rocker Edgar Winter in “I Love My Dad” fails to elicit the expected chuckle of recognition from his quietly reverential Italian audience, Kozelek opts to just scrap the song altogether midway through. (“It just sucks. Noted: ‘I Love My Dad’ does not work in Italy.”) Because even if the guy can’t watch the film <i>The Song Remains the Same </i>without being haunted by memories of dead classmates and some poor kid he once suckerpunched on the schoolyard, Kozelek still seeks to answer its eternal question: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZB4hPyPR2M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=11s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">does anybody remember laughter</a>? </p></div>"|19487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19487-mark-kozelek-live-at-biko/|7.8|Stuart Berman

<p>There aren’t a ton of moving parts contained within these songs, so their success is dependent on the strength of Citron’s vocals and guitar parts. She has an incredible ear for tone and texture, which marks most of the best tracks on <i>Careers</i>: the crushing, blurry chords of “Honey Do”, the fuzz-flecked lead that kicks off “All the Things”, the serrated stabs of the hard-charging “Ambular.” The contrast between the oft-aggressive, mildly menacing sound of Citron’s guitar and her sweet, spacey harmonies with Rose is a compelling source of tension, especially on road warrior anthems like “Planet Birthday” and “Ambular,” songs that sound like wholesome, slightly bored teens tangling with their worst slash-and-burn impulses and pouring them into muddy four-track recorders.</p>
<p>Citron’s invocation of the realities of teenage life — surface sweetness, hidden lust, churning and boiling internal sensations — is largely a conscious decision; as told to <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/10-new-artists-you-need-to-know-june-2014-20140619/beverly-0070977"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>, the concept for Beverly was developed around “this trashy character, a teenaged brat who hangs out in a 7-Eleven parking lot, smokes cigarettes, and doesn’t get along with the other kids.” It's a loose concept, sure, but its presence can be felt on <i>Careers</i>, especially when Citron careens from venomous, angry punk to jangly, mild lust to blown-out emotional hangovers in the span of three songs.</p>
<p>The thematic expression is musical, too: with a few notable exceptions, like sleepy shoegaze ballad ""Yale's Life"", Citron chooses to focus on her sound's ability to create feeling instead of leaning on her words. (Perhaps she subscribes to a slightly altered version of the old music journalism chestnut: writing about teendom is like dancing about architecture.) So lyrically, there's potential for growth, as her takes on youth can only stand to be fleshed out by greater lyrical focus. For now, <i>Careers </i>stands up as a testament to the power of serendipity and a decent first effort from a blooming young songwriter.</p></div>"|19540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19540-beverly-careers/|6.4|Jamieson Cox

For Abbott, and for Border Community boss <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15555-james-holden/"">James Holden</a>, this means an adherence to thorny analog synthesis, particularly the homespun, boutique world of modular synthesizers. The sound they've settled into—more motive than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>, softer and more abstract than club music—redefines British pastoral music for the plugged-in and fuzzed-out. The sound came to a head with Holden's 2013 epic<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18184-james-holden-the-inheritors/""><i>The Inheritors</i></a>, a bristling display that sounded like someone carved crop circles into UK techno. Abbott's second album, <i>Wysing Forest</i>, parries <i>The Inheritors</i>, offering a swampier take on Holden's craggy psychedelics.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of Border Community's principal players, Abbott has long been the gentlest. His debut album, <i>Holkham Drones</i>, and the excellent EPs that have followed, reveal him a descendant of kosmische dreamers like <a href=""Cluster"">Cluster</a> and Popul Vuh. He drew careful, cross-stitched melodies and purring rhythms from his tools, which were more often used for generative and experimental musics, and he also showed a rare ability to compose with these instruments, imbuing nimble compositions such as ""2nd 5th Heavy"" and ""Modern Driveway"" with rutty texture. Most synth geeks spend their time wrangling cats; Abbott's cats, perfectly behaved, meowed in harmony.</p>
<p>Abbott loosens the reins on <i>Wysing Forest</i>, conjuring instead a boggy psychedelia thicketed with noise. ""Amphis"", the second track (and, curiously, lead single), spends twelve minutes misting the listener with farty bubbles and brine-y hiss, its carbonation gone flat. ""Amphis"" is raw and jammy without being loose or free, a paradox that finds several of <i>Wysing Forest</i>'s tracks (""Tree Spirit"", ""The Balance of Power"") mired in their own smog. Abbott is too magnanimous and warm a technician to disappear completely into the fog, though. ""Free Migration"" and ""Highrise"" churn with surprising muscle, the former juggling the kind of ropey arpeggios Abbott songs used to tangle like yarn. An album-ending reprise of ""Amphis"" finds a serenity in ambience that much of <i>Wysing Forest</i> is too bothersome to locate.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What <i>Wysing Forest</i> truly misses is cohesion. Where <i>The Inheritors</i> carved out an alien mysticism and previous Abbott works revered in domestic warmth, <i>Wysing Forest</i> feels both vague and detached. There is a general lack of structure. ""The Balance of Power"" is a classic slow-builder, but it doesn't gather momentum; it just drifts prettily for four minutes, becomes loud, and then hushes itself. The effect isn't enchantment but indecision, something for which nature, but not synthesizer music, can be forgiven.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Wysing Forest</i> is stuck, then, between Abbott's enviable past work and his indeterminate future. Perhaps the best indictment of <i>Wysing Forest</i> is that it's difficult to discern just what Abbott was aiming for: to make his music more random, less discreet, noisier? Every option feels like a step back for a composer and sound designer of Abbott's talents. And that leaves <i>Wysing Forest</i>, a record too tart for beauty and too well reared for intractability.

OOIOO (say it <i>oh-oh-eye-oh-oh</i>) has endured, though, and nearly twenty years and six albums later, the all-female quartet—lead by Flaming Lips LP namesake and Boredoms percussionist Yoshimi—have established their own voice, audience, and influence, long since transcending their origins as ancillary Bore-product.<i> Gamel</i>—which arrived last year in Japan on Boredoms’ own Shock City imprint and which is only now seeing wide release through Thrill Jockey—is OOIOO’s seventh full-length and also the group’s strongest effort in some time. Like the group's best work, it takes a number of heady out-rock ideas and lines them up into a fairly easy to digest mixtape.</p>
<p>Given their shared DNA, Boredoms and OOIOO mirror one another in a number of ways, particularly in their zeal for primitivist rhythms, psychedelic tones, and trippy fluorescent color schemes. But while the former has gradually evolved into a sort of high concept drum circle—with performances that often involve a seven-necked guitar and dozens of percussionists—the latter has consistently kept things small. For the past decade, Boredoms' sheer mass has forced the project to focus on a single schtick, but OOIOO has been free to float from sound to sound, with songs that sometimes evoke fusion-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles Davis</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2384-konono-n1/"">Konono No. 1</a>, and the European prog-rock band Gong within the same five minutes.</p>
<p>Still, the best OOIOO records have always benefited from a central theme—be it kraut rock-style repetition (<i>Feather Float</i>) or tribal psychedelia (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13750-armonico-hewa/""><i>Armonico Hewa</i></a>)—to ground the band’s ever-mutating sensibility. This time around, the glue comes via two metallophone players, who expand OOIOO’s riffing with melodies drawn from Javanese gamelan music.</p>
<p>The instruments—which are played by hammering mallets against brass rods tuned to microtonal scales—preserve <i>Gamel</i>’s percussive and propulsive core, but also produce strange harmonies and overtones that imbue the music with a heady psychedelic sheen. If you’re an anime fan, some of <i>Gamel</i>’s sounds might inadvertently trigger memories of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zicXG2xehow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Japanese collective Geinoh Yamashirogumi’s score for the film <i>Akira</i></a>. That music used a similar mix of sounds—synthesizers, alternate tunings, traditional instruments—and perfectly complemented that film's strange and quasi-psychedelic sci-fi style. <i>Gamel </i>is a little more organic and much more ebullient, but just as otherworldly and futuristic.</p>
<p>Prior OOIOO albums were, evidently, recorded by the band and then extensively tweaked and edited by Yoshimi in studio post-production, but <i>Gamel </i>was mostly recorded live. As a result, the music isn’t quite as crowded. Yoshimi has laid off the effects—echo, reverb, and synthesizer glop—and there are fewer hard turns and zig-zags in the compositions. For the first time, OOIOO actually sounds like a real, living breathing band.</p>
<p>One of the best things about OOIOO records is that they provide a way to experience a number of fairly culty musical ideas—prog rock, psychedelic music, and so on—from a point of remove. The band's nonsense chants and jagged melodies provide all of the weirdness without necessarily conjuring the established imagery and associations, be they good or bad. It's easier to listen with fresh ears and hear these strange sounds as something playful, unfamiliar, and approachable, qualities that <i>Gamel </i>definitely possesses.</p></div>"|19541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19541-ooioo-gamel/|7.2|Aaron Leitko

Though that number is padded by several shorter EPs and a handful of splits, when paired with her output as Quiet Evenings (a duo with her husband Grant Evans), her rate of production outclasses many of her peers. And this in a field where prolificacy is almost a given. Given her pace of creation, her compositions are almost by definition ephemeral. But occasionally, as on her new cassette release <i>Alpha Piscium</i>, she takes a break from her airy synth washes to create a fully realized record greater than the sum of its slowly moving parts.</p>
<p>Conceived as a follow-up to her elegiac 2012 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16594-motion-sickness-of-time-travel/"">self-titled double LP</a>, this new tape carefully pushes Evans' abstract <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_School_of_electronic_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Berlin School</a> inclinations toward something more sculpted and structured. Much of <i>Alpha Piscium</i> finds Evans working in short form; she still relies mostly on an array of synthesizers and her own voice, but here she's bearing down to give tracks like the album's throbbing opener ""The Blossoms"" urgency and forward momentum. More happens in less time. Placid clicks and flickers at beginning of ""Ikebana II"" give way to circling, birdlike synthesizer melodies before falling back apart into its constituent electronic elements, all in the span of four minutes. </p>
<p>Evans has spent the better part of the last year exploring her more intense and tortured side on a series of CD-Rs dedicated to each month's full moon, and those dark and distended releases come to mind here in the gloomy hiss of the album's longest track ""You Don't Know What It's Like"". Her voice, which has been used in the as a means of giving her reverberant hymns a sense of uplift, functions here to issue brief discordant moans, unsettling little vocalizations that echo the dreariness of the 11-minute dirge.</p>
<p>The more significant releases in Evans' catalog function as a sort of summation, compiling all the tricks and techniques she's learned since the last one. Given the number of Motion Sickness of Time Travel releases since her self-titled LP, her sound has acquired a number of new wrinkles. But <i>Alpha Piscium</i> mostly picks up on the general path she's followed of her entire career. She's aiming for a little more momentum and a little more unease, teasing the idea of more straightforward structures. At a fraction of the length of <i>Motion Sickness of Time Travel</i>, <i>Alpha Piscium</i> might be just a hair less ambitious, but it's world of gauzy (and this time around, unnerving) synthesizer drones still invites exploration. </p></div>"|19525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19525-motion-sickness-of-time-travel-alpha-piscium/|7.8|Colin Joyce

James released 2001’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/225-drukqs/"" target=""_blank""><i>Drukqs</i></a>, the last proper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a> album, it was considered a massive disappointment. The 2xCD set mixed frenetic drill’n’bass tracks with gorgeous Satie-like miniatures for prepared piano, and the feeling at the time was that he’d been here before and done it all better. After 1999’s “Windowlicker”, a landmark track that was both deeply strange and also somehow a pop hit, there was an unspoken dream that James might just might change popular music completely, remake it in his image. <i>Drukqs</i> didn’t come close to fulfilling that promise, but listening to it 13 years later, perhaps not surprisingly, it sounds more interesting than it did at the time. Could this have something to do with it being the last Aphex Twin album? When we heard it in 2001, we had every reason to think that there might be another around the corner in a year or two.</p>
<p>So <i>Drukqs</i> seemed more like a bump in the road, maybe, than an artist coasting for a minute. It wasn’t the last we heard from James—there were the many Analord releases in 2005, some stray tracks, additional work as the Tuss—but James’ unbelievable 10-year run as a creative force mostly ended just after the turn of the millennium. Since we’re still left wondering if and when he’ll make a full return to the world of recorded music, the huge clutch of music he <i>did</i> release seems more classic with each passing day. He’s become something like electronic music’s post-retirement Miles Davis: from the vantage point of the 1980s and later, say, everything Miles released through his 1975 hiatus sounded amazing. An artist who quits can become so revered, what output there is becomes enveloped in a kind of aura, and you start to hear it differently. Tracks that don’t necessarily connect in a big way on their own become understood as an important part of a bigger picture, and its perceived importance grows exponentially.</p>
<p>I mention all this by way of saying that the “new” album by Richard James, the <i>Caustic Window LP</i>, sounds very good, but there’s so much wrapped up in hearing new/old music from him it can be hard to puzzle out. That this set has such a strange genesis also seems appropriate, given James’ very low public profile and long history of “Is this him or someone else?” releases. Earlier this year, a test pressing of a previously unreleased LP by Caustic Window, one of James’ many pseudonyms, originally intended for release on Rephlex, the label he owns with Grant Wilson-Claridge, appeared for sale on Discogs. Members of the We Are the Music Makers forum, an active message board dedicated to electronic music in general and Aphex Twin in particular, persuaded Rephlex to sanction an unusual idea for distributing the music: they would raise money through Kickstarter and those who contributed would get a high-quality digital copy of the record, recorded from a needle-drop of the test pressing. After the project was funded and the music digitized, the test pressing was auctioned on eBay. Some of the money went to the label, some went to charity. But 4,000 people got lossless files of the record from donating, and then of course it leaked. It’s a long way for music to travel in 20 years, and it’d be an interesting story based only on the crowd-funding angle, showing the connectedness of fandom in the digital era. But the music has its own rewards.</p>
<p>It helps to understand where James was in 1994. For the previous three years, he’d been issuing a string of 12""s and EPs under various names, most of which were firmly under the umbrella of acid house and techno. You can find these tracks scattered across the Caustic Window set <i>Compilation</i>, the Aphex Twin collection <i>Classics</i>, the Polygon Window album <i>Surfing on Sine Waves</i>, and the <i>Analogue Bubblebath</i> EPs. In addition to functional dance music, James had also put out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/223-selected-ambient-works-85-92/"" target=""_blank""><i>Selected Ambient Works 85–92</i></a> and, around the time this album would have come out, the legendary <i>Selected Ambient Works Vol. II</i>, so we’re talking about some serious output in just a couple of years.</p>
<p>During the early days, James tended to go to extremes. He made dance music that was often harsh and repetitive and then he made ambient music that was stirring in its simple beauty. He was exploring the edges, figuring out where the boundaries were, and in the second half of the 1990s he figured out how to make it all work together. What’s interesting about the <i>Caustic Window LP</i>, especially relative to the abrasive material collected on <i>Compilation</i>, is that it’s generally measured, never too harsh or too fast and also never especially lyrical. It feels like an album, with tracks that were not singles meant to be heard together. James uses this middle ground as a showcase for his unerring feel for structure and his ability to make electronic tracks there were futuristic but also imbued with personality, where you get a sense of the man behind the controls.</p>
<p>So the highlights here, which include the bouncy electro-cruncher “Mumbly” (later a live staple), the spacious and easily tuneful “Fingertrips”, the salsa-inflected acid house “Squidge in the Fridge”, and the chilled-out and playful neo-trip-hop “Jazzphase”, sound best in the context of the record as a complete listen, with its gradually shifting palette and BPMs. James’ work during this era had a slightly crude, homemade quality that brought it down to earth but also, with its contrasts, served to highlight the overall musicality. If these are not necessarily the prettiest melodies he created, <i>Caustic Window LP</i> is still filled with tunes that work brilliantly <i>as</i> tunes, with memorable chord progressions that move through clearly delineated sections. One of James’ defining qualities is that he’s almost never boring; there’s almost always <i>some</i> element of fascination in his tracks, whether it’s an oddball sample, a weird texture, an impossibly heavy percussion line, or tune that won’t leave your head.</p>
<p>It’s only on the album’s final third that the record takes a sharp turn, as the nice but ultimately too-long mood piece “101 Rainbows (Ambient Mix)” leads into the hyper-distorted “Phlaps” and the blistering acid of “Cunt” and then into a listen-once track of phone pranks. It’s tempting to speculate on how the record would have been received at the time and why it might have been shelved. James was moving fast in those days, so it’s possible that this album felt too much like where he’d been before, especially given the new ground he was breaking with <i>SAW II</i>. By the following year’s <i>I Care Because You Do</i> his sound was again changing rapidly, and the rest of the decade saw him attaining the status of a serious composer. Given all that, <i>Caustic Window LP</i> probably wouldn’t have left a significant mark, and would have been heard as second-tier James. Twenty years later, though, we’re hearing it with that aura, that extra bit of longing that comes from how scarce music from James has become. And in that light, second tier is still very good indeed.</p></div>"|19574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19574-aphex-twin-caustic-window/|8.1|Mark Richardson

With their iconic avatars, both of these electronica artistic entities spoke to Philip Dick-ian replicas with their names, and both made exemplary album statements that year, Richard D. James with <i>Selected Ambient Works II</i> and the latter –the primary alias of producer Richard Michael Hawtin—with his acid to-the-point-of-blotter-cover <i>Sheet One</i>. While both albums were minimal to the point of being psychotropic, it was only here that two of the greatest electronic artists were at this nexus. Aphex Twin would embrace drill’n’bass, acid, and <a href=""http://youtu.be/7MBaEEODzU0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">twisted singles that doubled as maximal pop</a>, achieving cult of personality status before all but dropping out of view (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55664-aphex-twins-caustic-window-test-pressing-picks-up-46300-on-ebay/"">at least until this month</a>). Conversely, Hawtin went deeper into minimalism while also remaining one of the most respected and prolific producers/remixers/DJs of the last twenty years.</p>
<p>Pushing into new realms, which included spelunking ever deeper into the sonic depths of Detroit and Berlin-styled minimal techno across his imprints, Plus 8, Probe and M_nus, Hawtin is that rare tireless electronic artist, booking residencies in Ibiza as well as multimedia installations in art museums. His extensive, high-caliber back catalog makes him the minimal techno Tim Duncan, spanning from the early '90s pared-down masters like Jeff Mills, Dan Bell, and Robert Hood to the Berlin “minimal trinity” alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29917-ricardo-villalobos-and-max-loderbauer/"">Ricardo Villalobos</a> and Magda <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/techno/6343-the-month-in-techno/"">in the new century</a>. While he retired the Plastikman moniker after the glum break-up vocalizations of 2003’s <i>Closer</i>, an invitation last year to perform at the Guggenheim’s 2013 International Gala in New York City led Hawtin to revive the moniker.</p>
<p>While crafted for a onetime live performance, <i>Ex</i> isn’t quite a live album. It’s seven original tracks (all beginning with “Ex-“) that clock in just a hair under an hour. It’s better to conceive of <i>Ex</i> holistically, rather than as seven individual tracks—in part because the album's distinct parts tend to blend into one another, with little to differentiate them. One might not know of the illuminated monolith that was situated in the museum’s rotunda while listening to the album, but it’s easy to imagine a beacon of some sort amid the slow opening 303 throbs of “EXposed”; when Hawtin sets the 303 to its most caustic, it’s fun to imagine said light source being turned into <a href=""http://thump.vice.com/en_ca/words/richie-hawtin-guggenheim-rich-people"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a bug zapper for the glitterati in attendance</a>.</p>
<p>But long stretches of <i>Ex</i> find Hawtin twisting knobs not for sustained release but to make sure everything doesn't grind to a halt. The squelching melody at the center of “EXposed” is vintage Hawtin that fans will undoubtedly recognize, but for an artist able to exact psychedelic profundity from agonizingly slow filter sweeps, there are spans where he has nowhere to go with the 303, the components of “EXtend” not quite pressurizing to warrant release. The slow, steady movement from the spacious yet foreboding span from “EXplore” into “EXpire” is a move from valley to plateau (peaking with the aural hallucination of skittering percussion and synthesized orchestras) that feels like Hawtin at his most cinematic and ecstatic. But aside from a glimpse of such a peak, one wonders what reviving the Plastikman moniker achieved that night in the museum, aside from proving the futility of wishing one could go back in time twenty years.</p></div>"|19475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19475-plastikman-ex/|6.5|Andy Beta

The band formed in 1973, a time when one of their formative influences, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"">Roxy Music</a>, were in their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Eno</a>-inspired pomp. Fired up on a diet of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.G._Ballard"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">J.G. Ballard</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5866-william-s-burroughs/"">William S. Burroughs</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brion_Gysin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brion Gysin</a>, Cabaret Voltaire borrowed their name from a Zurich nightclub that was a gathering spot for pivotal figures in the Dada movement, and by 1974 settled into a steady lineup of Richard Kirk, Stephen Mallinder, and Chris Watson. Some of their abstract work from that period was gathered together on a three-disc collection, <i>Methodology ‘74/’78</i>, released by <a href=""http://mute.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mute</a> in 2002. But their story really starts in 1978, with the band recording out of their own Western Works headquarters, where they adhered to a do-it-yourself ethos that would link them to the bracket of groups loosely banded under the post-punk banner.</p>
<p>The abundance of disused industrial spaces in Sheffield at the end of the 1970s worked in the band’s favor, both as a suitably dystopian backdrop to get inspired by and as a place to find cheap or free spaces to work in. Out of that came Western Works, a place Kirk describes as “Andy Warhol’s Factory on a fifty-pence budget.” Their debut EP, <i>Extended Play</i>, was recorded before they founded their own studio, but the spirit was already fully intact. Represented here by two tracks, notably “Do the Mussolini (Headkick)”, it’s a masterpiece in detachment, forming a sound so hollowed out and distant it feels like all three members of the band are sitting across the room, fixing you with an icy stare. Photos and sleeves from the era perfectly complement the vision—the anti-art record covers, in particular <i>Extended Play</i> and <i>Nag Nag Nag</i>, look like they’ve been fed through a black-and-white Xerox machine countless times, giving the shots of black-clad band members a suitably sub-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">Velvets</a> air of mystery.</p>
<p>Much of the material on <i>#7885 (Electropunk to Technopop 1978 – 1985)</i> will already be familiar to longstanding fans of the band, its use mostly derived from the way it traces their creative arc over this period. Watson departed in 1981, which may be the reason for the gap in material covered here—it spans ‘78-’81, then picks up again with a clutch of material from ‘83-’85. Strangely, one of their most popular songs from that initial era, the TV evangelist-inspired “Sluggin’ fer Jesus”, doesn’t feature. Still, it’s practically a greatest hits set, most notable for how they treated electronics and vocals in their formative days. Everything is so processed, so tightly wound, it often sounds like someone struggling to get out of restraints. At times it manages to be both big and small—”Nag Nag Nag”, as close as Cabaret Voltaire get to a signature song, is dominated by a vast organ grind, matched to beats so flat they resemble the last exhale of a drum machine about to shuffle out of life.</p>
<p>The cheap sound of the nascent Cabaret Voltaire appears to be born out of necessity as well as desire. This album charts the sound of a band improving, filling out their vision, leaving behind their origins simply because they had a better grasp on what they were doing. “Silent Command” from 1979 marks a huge sonic shift from “Nag Nag Nag”, which was only released four months prior. It draws on reggae, pop, and even whimsical fairground organ, as well as the signal-jamming vocal cut-ups they would explore in greater detail as they progressed. Clearly this was a band fascinated by the bridge between high and low culture, particularly in the desensitizing effect of TV news, which would spew out the topical fare Cabaret Voltaire would often pick up on in their songs, beaming it out to an audience steadily anesthetized to shock. There’s an anger and an emptiness to a song like “Seconds Too Late”, with Mallinder pulling off the familiar trick of throwing his vocal into the background, relegated to a voice howling helplessly from the void.</p>
<p>While never as overtly pop leaning as fellow Sheffield synth devotees <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7221-the-human-league/"">the Human League</a>, there is a greater sense of polish to the post-Watson material. Backed by the <a href=""http://www.somebizarre.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Some Bizzare</a> label, who had a sizable hit with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3859-soft-cell/"">Soft Cell</a>’s take on “Tainted Love”, Mallinder’s voice is suddenly front and center, and the sound strung somewhere between the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/138-art-of-noise/"">Art of Noise</a>, a vintage <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Baker_(musician)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Baker</a> production, and an industrial funk workout. The three tracks present from 1983’s <i>The Crackdown</i> all feel like they could have been hits—a feeling only amplified by the later “Sensoria” and “I Want You”, both of which do a better job of marrying older Cabaret Voltaire fascinations (vocal cut-ups, the pileup of information spewing forth into the culture) with something approaching pop structure. Despite notable differences, there’s never a feeling of change being forced—it’s possible to trace a progression from “Nag Nag Nag” to “Kino”, with the latter as wilfully stiff and hard-hitting as the former, just with different tools and fascinations to draw on in the execution.</p>
<p>With the post ‘83 material there’s a sense of Cabaret Voltaire getting swept along on the tide turn toward industrial-tinged electronic sounds in the UK mainstream, although that sense of steely remove, such a vital part of the band’s sound across eras, always keeps them from the wider public’s gaze. It never feels like they were cognizant of anyone watching from the outside; despite the occasional sound locking the music into a particular era, much of this music feels isolated from anything else going on, with Kirk and Mallinder ultimately drawing strength from the separation they bring to their work.

But as an entry point into two of the distinct faces of Cabaret Voltaire, <i>#7885</i> is an undeniably valuable document, and one that’s as much about the importance of growth and change as it is about the birth of a sound.</p></div>"|19551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19551-cabaret-voltaire-7885-electropunk-to-technopop-1978-1985/|7.8|Nick Neyland

Most of their self-titled debut sounds like something that could’ve come out in the late 1970s or early ’80s, a period when bands nominally classified as post-punk started messing around with synthesizers, and peacocks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a> realized you could make rock that sounded cerebral and far-out without becoming Yes. The palette is gray, the vocals are real Teutonic. Think of it as pocket goth: A sullen, hooded tempest made at manageable scale.</p>
<p>Jonny, who in the interest of being official is named Jonathan Schenke, is an engineer with credits on albums by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"">Liturgy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30148-frankie-rose/"">Frankie Rose</a>, and most recently, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"">Parquet Courts</a>—all young rock bands that approach the idiom of rock music from very different perspectives. (<i>Eaters</i> has also been co-released on Dull Tools, a label run in part by Parquet Courts singer and guitarist Andrew Savage.)</p>
<p><i>Eaters</i>, too, could be called a rock album, though with the exception of “Through All” and “The Way” it features few obviously discernible guitars, and most of its songs are shaped less like songs than like quasi-ambient miniatures that use the signposts of vocal melodies and propulsive drums to cover up for the fact that all Bob and Jonny really want to do is play with texture. And the textures on <i>Eaters</i> are beautiful: Grim and subdued but so rich you could raise tomatoes in them. More than any melody or song, it’s the sound of the album that keeps me interested. So while I recognize that “Bury the Lines” and “Through All” feel calibrated to be singles, they also feel beholden to convention in ways that weirder, looser experiments like “Icarish” and “This Is Round” don’t.</p>
<p>Along with bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30479-merchandise/"">Merchandise</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30145-total-control/"">Total Control</a>, Eaters seem like part of a microshift in indie music away from color and variegation to something comparatively austere. Call it a momentary juke back into modernism as we crest the Aquarian age. Maybe it’s just the comfort of the past—that almost quaint way young bands mine old sounds the way people down in Williamsburg, Virginia keep making candles just like they did in the bloodletting days. The quiet irony of <i>Eaters</i> is that it feels like a period piece for a time in music when so many things felt new. </p></div>"|19485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19485-eaters-eaters/|6.4|Mike Powell

Though his crepuscular inclinations still manifest itself in some of the music he makes under this new moniker, the aggression, hostility, and clanging signifiers of industrial music that populated that earlier work have largely vanished, supplanted with hushed keyboard swells and lazily clattering percussion. Over the course of one EP and two full-lengths, Dall and longtime collaborator Alex Ander have focused their efforts on capturing ominousness rather than agitation; on their new album <i>Will To Be Well</i>, they offer placidity in the wake of that disquietude.<br/><br/>Dall has said that this new LP continues to explore his ongoing fascination with the work anti-psychiatry figurehead R.D. Laing. But rather than impose the academic sterility of such arcane ideas upon the record, he leans on the that philosophy's association with the new age movement, cribbing the delicate, technicolor ooze that artists like Laraaji have explored since the genre's 1970s heyday. <br/><br/>""Lovers of the Highlands"", in particular, pairs that movement's swooning hum with the familiar horror score trappings of albums past. But the darkness that Dall and Ander previously mined isn't as present on <i>Will To Be Well</i>. The distant string swells that open and underpin ""Four Daughters by Four Women"" wouldn't seem so out of place on an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/"">Air France</a> record; the track eventually dissolves into a series of anxious chattering vocal samples, but this time around elation breaks through Dalhous' established facade of blackness. By letting light in, the textural play featured on the buoyant synth organ workout ""Someone Secure"" and the rippling, florid ""Function Curve"" stand out against the record's gloomier moments.<br/><br/>Stripped of their obfuscation, and with a hefty helping of optimism, Dall and Ander's compositions resemble the muted sentimentalities of his fellow Scots in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada"">Boards of Canada</a>. Dalhous' sound remains more nervous and jittery than the work of Mike Sandison and Marcus Eoin, but <i>Will To Be Well</i> uses its woozy, watery synth pads and vacant, skittering percussion as devotional rather than de-motivational tools. Where past efforts buried its intimacy under coldness and severity, <i>Will To Be Well</i> offers a warm, familiar embrace.</p></div>"|19490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19490-dalhous-will-to-be-well/|7.5|Colin Joyce

It’s nearly impossible to criticize the album without coming across as an enemy of “fun,” due in part to RiFF RAFF’s knowing, over-the-top branding as low-culture trash. But irony and irreverence can only do so much lifting on a record this thin. <i>Neon Icon</i> is hardly an affront to hip-hop’s very foundation; instead, it’s an adequate, listenable rap album, and for a part-time rapper/full-time jaw-dropper, there couldn’t be a more damning outcome.</p>
<p>RiFF RAFF first reached the public eye on a reality show, MTV’s “From G’s to Gents”. But as a primordial piece of internet culture, RiFF RAFF’s star truly congealed in a wave of digital flotsam that crashed onto social media and YouTube around the turn of this decade, replete with collaborations and co-signs from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a>, Lil Debbie, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29609-soulja-boy"">Soulja Boy</a>. Stylistically, his music originated in Houston’s laconic Swishahouse punchline style; personality-wise, he has a flashy appearance, garish tattoos, and absurdist wit—often in his music, but even more frequently on Twitter. His profile rose: he likely inspired James Franco’s role in <i>Spring Breakers</i>, then appeared on “One Life to Live” impersonating James Franco. He’s a troll, drawing accusations of minstrelsy, sparking thorough <a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2013/09/10/becoming-riff-raff-how-a-white-suburban-kid-morphed-into-todays-most-enigmatic-rapper"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">investigations into his background</a><a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2013/09/10/becoming-riff-raff-how-a-white-suburban-kid-morphed-into-todays-most-enigmatic-rapper%E2%80%9D"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a>and receiving coverage that <a href=""http://gawker.com/5912835/riff-raffs-got-a-record-deal-making-sense-of-the-most-viral-human-being-in-music%E2%80%9D"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fawned</a> over his “brilliantly absurd” lyrics and “rangy, Dadaist luxury rap.”</p>
<p>Although he calls himself the “white <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a> with a spray tan,” his lyrical prowess plumbs a much shallower pool than Gucci’s. On <i>Neon Icon</i>, his rap style has atrophied into a game of hip-hop Madlibs, the “White ____” and “Rap Game _____” one-liners that have so bolstered his Klout score. As on “How to Be the Man”: “Might hit the club and it’s the white Danny Glover/ Rap game Uncle Ben pulling rice out the oven.” What does this mean? Absolutely nothing. It’s arbitrary pop culture juxtaposition, like Peter from “Family Guy” saying, “You know what I haven’t had in awhile? Big League Chew.” RiFF RAFF wasn’t always this limited. His earlier work that broke through the digital noise—records like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3i5nDCw8C0%E2%80%9D%22"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Larry Bird”</a>—still possessed the feeling of forward motion, even if it just took the listener into strange little stoned circles.</p>
<p>In the three-odd years since “Larry Bird” first appeared online, RiFF RAFF has engaged in an uphill battle to keep the punchlines churning. As his audience has grown, they’ve demanded an increasing level of ridiculousness, so as it became necessary to efficiently produce newer, more ridiculous music, RiFF RAFF dropped the vestigial tool of narrative. So ridiculousness increasingly has become RiFF RAFF’s stock in trade, and this has happened because of the fans he’s cultivated—in distancing himself from earlier collaborators like Soulja Boy and TKO Capone, in signing with Diplo, and recognizing that ridiculousness pays big bucks. Narrative connectivity is not a priority. </p>
<p>What’s taken the place of that storytelling is something at which his label head Diplo excels: curation of cool. Thus, we get a record with a diverse musical backdrop. Opener “ Introducing the Icon” is an unexpected burst of early ‘90s House of Pain-style combativeness. It’s also one of the album’s best songs, swiping a retro costume that hasn’t been worn through with overuse, and which meshes surprisingly well with RiFF RAFF’s sloppy Texas delivery. (In contrast, one of Diplo’s weaknesses is songwriting, so the his production “Kokayne” has all the style of hard rock with none of the function.) The Mike Posner-featuring “Maybe You Love Me” is easily the catchiest song on the album, an earnest R&amp;Bubblegum single that, while not a likely Billboard hit, is definitely on trend. And the album’s closing song, “VIP Pass to My Heart”, isn’t even a rap song at all, but a twee club jam in the vein of Uffie’s euphoric club rat rap single ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDRsOrBGLxk%E2%80%9D"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pop the Glock</a>"".</p>
<p>Ironically, the cool-chasing half of the record seems only to have stumped fans of more straightforward tracks like “Wetter Than Tsunami” and “Tip Toe Wing in My Jawwdinz”. Music critic Anthony Fantano, a fan of RiFF RAFF’s lyrical ridiculousness, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhxuyujfep8%E2%80%9D%22"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently</a> seemed confounded by the album’s musical breadth, criticizing the neo trip-hop cut “Cool It Down” as a “<i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitey_Ford_Sings_the_Blues"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Whitey Ford Sings the Blues</a></i> song”. It’s a catch–22 for RiFF RAFF. The “cool” musical choices give what would be a monotonous record needed variety, but they also threaten to delimit his audience to hipster trendspotters. Further muddying the waters is the presence of guest rappers Mac Miller and Childish Gambino, whose respective styles seem tonally at odds with RiFF RAFF and Diplo’s approach. The effect isn’t so much that those rappers have confounded our expectations; instead, their presence means the album’s overall direction comes across as confused.</p>
<p>The bulk of <i>Neon Icon</i> resists coherence or purpose, although “Cool It Down” does seem an oblique response to those who’ve attempted to unearth his past or reveal him as a fake or minstrel: “They wanna tell you what you can’t do based on former facts/ If I wanted to hear that bullshit I’d be in history class.” Perhaps it’s a bit of masterful stagecraft, a knowing bit of irony, but the song scans as a sincere. What if it is? What if it’s not RiFF RAFF who’s the problem, but us?</p>
<p>RiFF RAFF has had his background probed more than almost any rapper in recent memory. Early interviewers seemed convinced they would unlock his enigma, which always entailed discovering whether he was “for real” or “joking”—a parody of hip-hop. These aren’t questions most rappers face; Lil B was celebrated for his eccentricity, but seldom interrogated as a rapper critiquing the form.</p>
<p><a href=""http://artforum.com/passages/id=45815"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In a piece for <i>ArtForum</i></a> after Amiri Baraka’s passing last year, the artist Adam Pendleton suggested that Black American Culture is seemingly legible through only two lenses: realism and expressionism. “If abstraction remains illegible in the work of the black artist,” Pendleton writes, “This is because black individuals remain abstract.” Amiri Baraka’s work was proof that this constricted reading of black art was a lie. But that lie is the reason that many listeners experience a black artist’s eccentricity as pure expression, as if their art might not be equally constructed. When an artist like Riff Raff <span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">comes along, listeners jump to the obvious conclusion: as a white artist, he must have agency. He must be faking it, perhaps mocking black expressionism. And the investigation begins.</span></p>
<p>But what if he isn’t? <a href=""http://themartorialist.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/moved-to-alabama-got-silk-pyjamas_27.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Convincing arguments</a> have surfaced suggesting the real originator of the RiFF RAFF flow—as well as those of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJwvQ7uGREE%E2%80%9D"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">many other artists</a> in Texas—is the rapper Yungstar. Hugely influential, like several of the rappers in DJ Screw's Screwed Up Click, he never rose to national prominence. If RiFF RAFF’s primary influence, then, isn’t a stereotypical Southerner, but an influential yet obscure talent, the notion that RiFF RAFF is simply making fun of black culture falls away—as do the fans for whom that is his primary appeal. This would require recognition from listeners and the press that our fascination with RiFF RAFF was based on a false premise in the first place. And at that point, the bland truth of his art’s consequence is revealed: he’s just another marginal talent benefitting from an unsung artist’s innovations.</p></div>"|19484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19484-riff-raff-neon-icon/|5.4|David Drake

Circulatory System—Hart and most of the rest of the much-beloved <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30619-the-olivia-tremor-control/"">Olivia Tremor Control</a>, minus the late, great Bill Doss—have always seemed like a band in the loosest sense of the term, touring infrequently and recording sporadically. And frontman Hart's multiple sclerosis—and the attendant bouts of exhaustion—have further affected their output: ""I want to write more songs,"" he <a href=""http://www.lowtimespodcast.com/catching-up-with-will-cullen-hart/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told an interviewer</a> last year, ""but I get sleepy and go to sleep. It sucks."" <i>Mosaics</i> is the first Circulatory System LP in half-a-decade's time, the long-awaited follow up to 2009's <i>Signal Morning</i>. Should current patterns hold, there's a fair chance the next installment won't be hot on its heels.<br/><br/>And Hart and company seem to have designed <i>Mosaics</i> with durability in mind. <i>Mosaics</i> spends an hour sounding like an eternity: it's beautiful, frustrating, full-hearted, foggy-headed, time-distorting, brain-bending stuff, in the grand tradition of the Elephant 6 classics. More than anything, though, <i>Mosaics</i> just feels exceedingly generous; should Hart—for perfectly understandable reasons—only have one Circulatory System record in him every half decade or so, he's gonna make damn sure that record gives you plenty to chew on. The layers upon layers Hart's built into <i>Mosaics Within Mosaics</i> seem designed to withstand the erosion that comes with deep listens. It's possible to imagine that, five years from now, we'll still be digging through <i>Mosaics</i>, turning over the old stones and shaking out the young rocks.<br/><br/><i>Mosaics Within Mosaics</i> is built atop Hart's home recordings, some dating back a dozen years. Once he did what he could back at the house, Hart farmed out the embellishments and overdubs to the System's inner circle: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3025-neutral-milk-hotel/"">Neutral Milk Hotel</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2659-jeff-mangum/"">Jeff Mangum</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10055-jeremy-barnes/"">Jeremy Barnes</a>, Hether McIntosh of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2108-the-instruments"">the Instruments</a>, Peter Erchick of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25245-pipes-you-see-pipes-you-dont/"">Pipes You See Pipes You Don't</a>, Laminated Cat's AJ Griffin, and Dream Boat's John Fernandes. These newly fleshed-out tapes were then turned over to Faster Circuits' Derek Almstead, who helped Hart wrestle the records into their final form. The methods may've changed from the days of communing around the same four-track. But the effect is largely the same. <i>Mosaics Within Mosaics</i>, despite a gentler feel than much of Hart's work, is trademark Elephant 6: ornately constructed with an off-the-cuff feel, an exploration into the mysteries of the universe set to wheezing pump-organs and trilling clarinets.<br/><br/>2009's dense, dizzying <i>Signal Morning</i> was a peculiar animal; listen close enough, and you could practically hear the ghosts of all the records Hart and company had scrapped, or reshaped, or stripped for parts to push the long-gestating <i>Signal Morning</i> out into the world. Those ever-churning fantasias were plenty hooky, but you had to fight through the charred remains of every song-that-wasn't just to get to them. <i>Mosaics</i>, while recognizably a Circulatory System record, takes a different tack: it's cleaner, clearer-sounding, less riddled with maze-like constructions or clotted with endless overdubs. But there's still quite a lot to get your head around here, an ever-shifting patina of march tempos, instrumental outbursts, and the eternally wide-eyed Will Cullen Hart's increasingly wizened lyrics.<br/><br/>Over the years, Hart's grown ever-fonder of symbols and signals, and even the more plainspoken lyrics here feel characteristically cryptic. There are numerous references to a tension between the physical and the mental, the age we're in and the age we feel we belong to. It's tempting to read something about Hart's current condition into these lines, but the life of the mind, the transcendence of the body, and the boundless nature of the soul are longstanding fascinations for him, and for psychedelia in general. That exploration of the point where the innerspace becomes outside blasts is where Hart shines; where so many post-60s psych-rock contents itself with the same old tangerine trees and marmalade skies, Hart—even on what may be the the least capitol-P psychedelic record Hart's ever been involved with—does his best to articulate the combination of confusion and clarity at the heart of the psychedelic experience. Questions beget not answers, but more questions.<br/><br/>Hart and Almstead have taken great pains to give the far-flung <i>Mosaics</i> some structure and cohesion. Compared to the everything-all-the-time feel of <i>Signal Morning</i>, each piece of <i>Mosaics</i> feels like its own discrete entity, every oddball interlude allowed its proper space. Hart's collagist penchant for alternating ponderous fuzz-pop with out-of-nowhere soundbursts is fully intact on <i>Mosaics</i>; there are eight ""Mosaics"" peppered throughout the set, everything from frazzled static to tinselly little guitar filigrees. The symbiotic back-and-forth between song and sound on <i>Mosaics</i> isn't always a perfect match; many of the songs here seem to stop themselves a bit short, relying on the wriggling interludes that follow to fill in the gaps. But the playing on <i>Mosaics</i> is sumptuous and scrappy alike; Hart's faith in his collaborators, most of whom he's known for multiple decades, is well-earned. Besides, Mosaics is an album's album, less concerned with standout moments than the overall impression given by its curious construction. The effect is very different than the skewed, baroque-leaning pop of their much-loved 2001 debut, or the sonic dogpile of <i>Signal Morning</i>; the quieter, more contemplative <i>Mosaics</i> plays like a series of gentle breezes blowing through an open window, a soundtrack to watching the morning slip slowly into the afternoon.<br/><br/>Opener ""Physical Mirage/Visible Magic"" finds a wobbly-voiced Hart shakily declaring this a ""perfectly normal day"", and by the time the utterly gorgeous closer ""Elastic Empire Coronation"" rolls around, he's in full voice, joined by his friends in a kind of declaration of weirdo solidarity: ""If you don't believe us, we can slip on by."" There are plenty of wonky, wriggling psych-pop tunes to be found amidst <i>Mosaics</i>' endless refractions: spiny and somewhat somber ""Bakery Spires"" is an ear-pricker of the highest order, as is ""Night Falls"", a kind of a doo-wop song sung from a vibrating hotel bed. But there's no ""Yesterday's World"" here, no head-and-shoulders highlight to be had, which gives <i>Mosaics</i> its feel of constant transformation. It's not a record about individual moments; it's about how those moments play off of each other, balance each other out, continue to delight and disorient. With some big pop blowout to look forward to, each listen feels different, the order seemingly shuffled and the arrangements reconfigured. It's possible to  listen to <i>Mosaics</i> 100 times and never quite hear the same record twice.<br/><br/>On early LP highlight ""Tiny Planes of Canvas,"" Hart boasts of an ability to ""see the world that no one else can."" Hart, operating largely from the confines of his bedroom, has once again created a world unto itself: weird, warm-hearted, endlessly curious, covered in kudzu. The sage, sanguine may not be a kaleidoscopic masterpiece like Circulatory System's debut—or those two eternally brilliant Olivia Tremor Control records—but it's possessed with that same spirit of discovery and wonder. It's a record just as baffling as it is beguiling, a grownass symphony to god, a journey to the center of Hart's expansive mind. No one's making music quite like this, not even the people who helped Hart making this very music, so if we've got another five years to wait for another Circulatory System album, the spiraling mysteries at the center of <i>Mosaics</i> should be more than enough to hold us.</p></div>"|19441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19441-circulatory-system-mosaics-within-mosaics/|7.9|Paul Thompson

He did so in the early 1960s, while he was running a blues club in Reading; for this, he has earned some mild rock-history infamy, but given his trajectory since then it's unlikely he stuck around to observe it. Cooper had other things on his mind, and if he had joined the Stones, he might never have gotten to any of them: he's a collage artist, a painter, a world traveler, a sometime-music journalist, and a Hawaiian shirt enthusiast who will lecture you on the complicated post-colonial origins of the Hawaiian shirt.  In Cooper's rich, erstwhile life, the Stones were bit players, a group of well-meaning British boys inviting him down a very dull-seeming road.</p>
<p>After he and the Stones parted ways, Cooper departed England for the south of Spain, spending time in Almuñécar, reading Borges and 12<sup>th</sup>-century and Muslim philosophy and formulating an approach for the solo records he began producing in 1969 for the Dawn label. <i>Trout Steel</i>, in 1970, was his second solo album and his first landmark statement; <i>Places I Know</i> and <i>Machine Gun Co.</i>, his fourth and fifth, were released in 1971 and '72. Cooper intended the two to be released at once, as a double album, but in ""a corporate decision that involved musical taste, economics, politics and men in suits with cigars and bad taste in ties,"" as he <a href=""http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2014/06/18/mike-cooper-the-aquarium-drunkard-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">deadpanned to Aquarium Drunkard</a>, they were released separately.</p>
<p>They eventually fell out of print as Cooper moved on, to collaborating with writers and painters to accompanying silent films with live performance. But Paradise of Bachelors, which has made a name for itself in the increasingly crowded reissue market, spent two years tracking down the masters. The resulting reissues are the first time the albums have been available on vinyl since their initial release. </p>
<p>It is surprising, upon revisiting these albums, to contemplate that <i>Trout Steel</i> arrived first and was followed by the other two. The ear, free of context, suggests the opposite story: <i>Places</i>, in particular, is a more modest, songful affair than <i>Trout Steel</i>, which has the gracefully exhaled quality of a master statement. The records all tell various angles of the same story, however; Cooper began in British folk alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4970-bert-jansch/"">Bert Jansch</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29646-michael-chapman/"">Michael Chapman</a>, strayed into country blues, and then veered further afield into free jazz when he became aware of Pharoah Sanders and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"">Ornette Coleman</a>. The wide-open music he makes here wants to let everything in: improv, folk-rock, blues, chamber pop. His high, rangy voice and dexterous, quietly brilliant guitar are the maypole that everything else twists around.</p>
<p>Cooper was driven by a firm theory in all of his explorations—namely, that country blues and free jazz are both ""microtonal"" forms that closely mimic the human voice and can naturally be combined that way. But as granular and egg-headed as that sounds, there is nothing even faintly theoretical about the music. The warmth of folk-rock is palpable throughout all three albums, even when observable traces of folk-rock have dissipated from the music. Cooper's tone is tender, grateful, wry, bewildered: ""All these things are mine and much more,"" goes the refrain of <i>Places I Know</i>'s ""Broken Bridges"". ""And nothing that I’m sayin' seems to wanna make you leave,"" he marvels on ""Night Journey"", a song that cribs directly from Bob Dylan's ""It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry"". ""You don't know how she comes to me from time to time,"" he sings on ""Time to Time"", a gently love-drunk ballad.</p>

Trap Them released their <i>Filth Rations</i> EP that year, and it was as complete a statement as any full-length they’d recorded to date—and just as joyless. <i>Darker Handcraft</i> followed in 2011, and that album elevated McKenney and crew to a new level. Prior to that, they were little more than another bunch of post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a> metalcore miscreants; after <i>Filth Rations</i> and <i>Darker Handcraft</i>, they sunk into a misanthropic pit of their own making. Misanthropy and humor, of course, can go hand-in-hand quite beautifully—but judging from <i>Blissfucker</i>, Trap Them’s new full-length and first since <i>Darker Handcraft</i>, McKenney is once again not laughing, and he doesn't have to.</p>
<p>There’s a grim, twisted irony at the heart of Trap Them that gives the band a perverse dimensionality, and <i>Blissfucker </i>brings it to the surface in a vivid blush of bruised black and blue. Where McKenney has long been a seething, writhing hardcore frontman cut from the same cloth as Converge’s Jacob Bannon, guitarist Brian Izzi is steeped in the vintage Swedish death metal of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22900-entombed/"">Entombed</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22510-at-the-gates/"">At the Gates</a>. Trap Them’s division of labor—and influence—has never been less distinct than on <i>Blissfucker</i>. The stylistic friction that defined the group has ground it down to the bone; hardcore and metal have finally bled together into an irreducible whole. “Salted Crypts” lays out an intricate template constructed of D-beat gallop, razor-swift thrash riffs, and pockets of charred melody; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16945-trap-them-lungrunners/"">“Lungrunners”</a> relies less on subtlety and more on time-lapse blast-beat erosion. Instead of detracting from McKenney’s nerve-tightening screams and abstract poetics, it underscores his openly dire worldview. The only constant in life is change, and that change comes quickly, perilously, and mercilessly.</p>
<p>McKenney and Izzi are now the only remaining original members of Trap Them. Bassist Baudhuin and drummer Brad Fickeisen make their full-length debut with the band here, with Fickeisen in particular having to fill a big vacancy—namely, former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8128-coliseum/"">Coliseum</a> drummer Chris Maggio, who brought his grenade-like intensity to <i>Filth Rations</i> and <i>Darker Handcraft</i>. As great as Maggio was, Fickeisen is an upgrade. More precise and dynamic, yet able to cultivate an air of chaos amid his calculation, Fickeisen pushes the rest of the band—especially Izzi—toward a more freeform and flowing cadence. Even as it suffocates, it breathes. On the sprawling tracks “Savage Climbers” and “Let Fall Each and Every Sedition Symptom”—whose only fault is sounding too much alike, dual climaxes on an album that might have been better served by one final death throe—nothing is released. Chasms of feedback and wounded howls open up, only to swallow themselves. And for every bomb the band lobs, McKenney hurls his own body on top of it.</p>
<p>The conceit that life and death are at stake every time a guitar is tuned or a microphone checked is, in a sense, romantic. McKenney, it should be remembered, doesn’t say that he has no sense of humor at all—only that his sense of humor sucks. There are no moments of lightness on <i>Blissfucker</i>, not even the steely glint of gallows humor. But there is a weirdness to its nested levels of nihilism and noise, as well as a subversive sense of both hardcore’s intransigence and metal’s melodrama. Too many shards of ideas are shoved into the long songs, and Fickeisen’s flash sometimes borders on showmanship, a glaring incongruity for a spartan outfit like Trap Them. Mostly, though, the new lineup locks into a trance of fatalistic terror, one that culminates in a hopeless, unhinged ecstasy. There may not be much to laugh about, but there’s definitely a punch line.</p></div>"|19565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19565-trap-them-blissfucker/|7.3|Jason Heller

That’s just one of the revelations he makes on “Longer Than You’ve been Alive”, the opening track from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3142-old-97s/"">Old 97's</a>’ ninth album, <i>Most Messed Up</i>. He also fesses up to washing down “mountains of weed, a handful of pills” with “oceans and oceans” of booze. “None the hard stuff, that shit kills.” He jumps off risers he shouldn’t even attempt to climb at his age, bickers with the other guys in the band like they’re old married couples, and still sometimes dreams of being the kind of rock star that simply can’t exist in today’s industry. “Rock stars were once such mythical creatures, up there with presidents, Playmates, and preachers,” he explains. “Now you just do it cause it’s what you do.” When Miller sings, “I’m not crazy about songs that get self-referential,” the universe threatens to collapse in on itself.</p>
<p><i>Most Messed Up</i> puts the ""old"" in Old 97's' bandname. The guys are all now in their 40s, alt-country survivors who have the gumption to admit they can’t keep singing about romantic vindictiveness when they’re all married with kids. Bad backs and disillusioned fans are one thing, but finding happiness can be disastrous for a band like this. So Miller tries to spice up his songwriting the way spouses try to spice up their marriages, addressing the difficulties of maintaining a spark with your bandmates as well as your mate. “Let’s Get Drunk and Get It On” opens with him propositioning a woman post-show with a bottle of booze, but it ends with him booking a room with a bottle of chilled champagne so he and the missus can have some time away from the kids.</p>
<p>Self-aware and self-deprecating, <i>Most Messed Up </i>seems like the kind of album that signals a comeback, and certainly the band rumble through these songs like they’re not tired of each other. Songs like “Give It Time” and “Wheels Off” sound like the Olds at their rowdiest, but they can’t really sustain that sense of abandon over a dozen tracks. “This Is the Ballad” and “The Disconnect” are far too fussy and clever from a guy who claims to hate self-referential songs, and “Guadalajara” sounds utterly embarrassed as it recounts the tale of a businessman tempted by a woman losing her bikini top. And the title track closes the album with the least persuasive line Miller may have ever penned: “I am the most messed up motherfucker in this town.” Does anyone, even Miller himself, actually buy that?</p>
<p>But the Olds were never a songwriter project. As distinctive as his lyrical voice can be, Miller is still blessed beyond measure to have these three guys backing him. Ken Bethea still plays like he still thinks you can surf in Texas, blending the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27957-the-ventures/"">Ventures</a> and the Sir Douglas Quintet into super-melodic, super-concise guitar lines, and the rhythm section of drummer Philip Peeples and bassist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15956-murry-hammond/"">Murry Hammond</a> still swing just enough to give these songs some aggression. Sure, the twitchy alienation of their earliest records is long gone, but the Old 97's are still fighting the good fight against respectability. </p></div>"|19548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19548-old-97s-most-messed-up/|6.4|Stephen Deusner

The last time he released a project, the formidable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16784-control-system/""><i>Control System</i></a>, it was 2012, the halcyon year of TDE: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30134-schoolboy-q"">Schoolboy Q</a> had scored the group's first radio success with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16216-schoolboy-q-habits-contradictions/""><i>Habits &amp; Contradictions</i></a>' ""Hands on the Wheel"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s major-label debut was a bright spot forming on the horizon. Back then, Lamar was a star-in-the-making, but not yet a star, and his crew's chemistry was in full bloom.<b> </b></p>
<p>Since then, Kendrick has crossed over—into platinum sales, apology texts from Macklemore, subliminal feuds with Drake—while Schoolboy, several tiers beneath his leader, toils in rap's middle class. When I saw him perform an obligatory, dead-eyed in-store at a Beats store in February, he dryly pointed to the terrible sound system as an indicator of his status: ""A nigga gotta go platinum,"" he joked. <i>Oxymoron</i> <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5923183/schoolboy-q-oxymoron-debuts-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-albums-chart"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performed respectably</a> on the album charts, but it also broke decisively with the moody, cinematic feel of the first flush of TDE releases. It was a major-label effort, through and through, the strain of compromise pulling at even its strongest cuts. </p>
<p>Ab-Soul, it was recently revealed, was <a href=""http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/fire-conversation-ab-soul-interview-new-video.29267.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">never signed</a> to Interscope. It's a poignant revelation, one casting Ab as the last-picked kid in gym class. In the meantime, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19014-isaiah-rashad-cilvia/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Isaiah Rashad may have eaten his lunch</a>. But <i>These Days...,</i> which finally sees release this week, doesn't seem to mind. It's a 2012-era Black Hippy release through and through, with the sprawling runtime (90-plus minutes), resonant repeated catchphrases, and grey-toned mood to prove it.<b> </b></p>
<p>""Last-picked kid at gym class"" suits Ab best anyway, since he reps the underdogs at every opportunity.  He has a thing for commercial pariahs: He is probably one of five living rappers in America who still <a href=""http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.29018/title.ab-soul-discusses-affinity-for-canibus-jay-z-nas-explains-these-days-album-title"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">eagerly namechecks Canibus</a> as an influence; he called Slaughterhouse ""<a href=""http://respect-mag.com/video-kendrick-lamar-and-ab-soul-talk-slaughterhouse-comparisons/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the illest lyricists in the game</a>.""

<p>He's a proud pipsqueak,  in other words, the self-appointed nerd of a cerebral crew. On the opening track ""God's Reign"", produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"">Purity Ring</a>'s Corin Roddick (who's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0s0XHVUGF0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">building an impressive sideline </a>in hip-hop), he raps ""Got your lady with literature in her Louis bag, got your kids studying outside of class"", while on ""Dub Sac"" he wants us to remember that ""martial law could happen any second!""  He embraces his outsider status, filling his raps with struggling mid-level rapper details: On ""Tree of Life"", he recalls selling out S.O.B.'s, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3JBJAu14g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a time-honored rite of passage</a>, and gives us his version of being hounded by paparazzi: Fans holding him up for pictures in the bus station terminal.</p>
<p>The more human Ab-Soul dares to be on record, the stronger he becomes. On <i>Control System</i>, he narrated his battle with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and mourned the death of his partner and collaborator Alori Joi, and on the intensely emotional ""Closure,"" he sings to an old flame. ""I wonder if you still praying to the east, I wonder if you ever forgave me.""</p>
<p>That doesn't make him heavy, though—Ab's on-record presence is primarily a playful one. On the infectiously simple DNYC3-produced ratchet (""<a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCIQyCkwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZvXPAMc_5UI%26feature%3Dkp&amp;ei=h-uqU-yHFYrIsATsoYGQDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXYUsVByv2R7Kp0NF1icyK2syT0Q&amp;bvm=bv.69620078,d.cWc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Good Day</a>,"" ""<a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQyCkwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLbouTdwOrVw%26feature%3Dkp&amp;ei=pOuqU4eoKszlsASrpID4Cg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEW5901E4Tp5YLv1dN15NpY07VZGQ&amp;bvm=bv.69620078,d.cWc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Faded</a>"") cut ""Twact,"" he makes an ""Arabian Knight/ Camel toe"" joke that belongs at a middle-school lunch table. He repurposes the chorus of Chief Keef's ""Love Sosa"" on ""Feelin' Us"" and mockingly signs a broken-down version of ""Hail Mary"" on the Danny  Brown-featuring ""Ride Slow"" as if he's purposefully misremembering it. On ""Hunnid Stax"", he's ""splitting clits with a money clip""—a very vivid mental image—and on ""Ride Slow"" he raps slyly about the ""residue on my debit card."" The margins of the songs overflow with lots of in-studio goofing—especially on the album's hidden final track ""W.R.O.H."", when Ab freestyles endlessly for an impressed group of friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of friends, there are new ones here: Rick Ross is on ""Nevermind"", and Puff even drops by to mumble something. Lupe Fiasco shows up on ""World Runners"". Schoolboy, Jay Rock, and, Kendrick are all here too, and you can hear some of his labelmates' success in the margins: ""Collard Greens"" plays in the background at the end of ""God's Reign"", and Kendrick raps on a freeform interlude that mimics Ab-Soul's appearance on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15653-section80/""><i>Section.80</i></a>.

The lyric sheet for their new album, <i>Typical System</i>, reads like stream-of-consciousness beat poetry; in between songs, it's dotted with manifesto-like musings that don't actually appear on the recordings. ""Our fragile subject confuses festivity for a grave militaristic orgy, and pens a carol to document collapse,"" reads the note following ""Bloody Glass"", the minimal wave experiment that opens the album. In case you had a shard of faith that Total Control have even a strand of optimistic DNA, here's the misanthropic footnote that follows ""Expensive Dog"", a dramatic garage-punk blast: ""In contrast to barbarous gamblers, the secure and prosperous demand companions of diseased and ill-fated breed. Mongrels prowl outside their gates."" Convention is hopeless.</p>
<p>Perhaps these anti-conformist scripts are meta-commentaries on Total Control itself. Since the band's genre-smashing 2011 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16143-henge-beat/"" target=""_blank"">Henge Beat</a>—</i>which fused oddball sci-fi New Wave and subtle beats with punk aggression and ideology—they've amassed a cultish underground following as well as some attention in the music industry. They released a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14345-scene-from-a-marriage/"" target=""_blank"">blackened 7"" on Sub Pop in 2012</a>, and, had they preferred, <i>Typical System</i> could have been released on a label bigger than tiny Seattle hardcore outpost <a href=""http://ironlungrecords.bigcartel.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iron Lung</a>. ""You don't need a safety net,"" sings Dan Stewart, detached frontman and resident nihilist philosopher, on <i>System</i>'s dreary synth-pop banger of a closing track. Whether these are self-subscribed mantras or not remains open to interpretation—but <i>Typical System</i> invites that. Across their discography, Total Control have been so idea-driven that it is hard to <i>not</i> intellectualize what they do. What's the ""lonely operation"" raging on garage ripper ""Systematic Fuck""? Does ""Black Spring"" refer to <a href=""http://www.ubu.com/sound/miller.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the free-associating Henry Miller novel</a>—and does the song's tense, motorik quality imply that its end-times themes actually stretch eternal? Is the title <i>Typical System</i> an allusion to keeping underground autonomy in the face of commercial opportunity? Does it matter?</p>
<p>Such questions are tempting, and it's easy to read into <i>Typical System</i>'s densities. But it's perhaps more satisfying to give oneself over to the record's bleak, peculiar breeze. The approach is not hugely different from <i>Henge Beat</i>—they've still got the toolbox you'd imagine from guys who variously play tough-guy hardcore (<a href=""http://ironlungpv.bandcamp.com/album/nationalism-7"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Straightjacket Nation</a>), primitive garage-punk (UV Race and Eddy Current Suppression Ring), and electronic dance music (Lace Curtain). Above all, Total Control's fair bit of touring since <i>Henge Beat</i> has allowed them more technical muscle, and thus a newfound tactility and energy streak.</p>
<p><i>Typical System</i>'s dynamics surprise at most turns, revealing their strange sense of humor. The soft sax wails of the underwater ""Liberal Party"" find Stewart deadpanning existentially on a ""Broken porch light/ Shattered sense of worth,"" before leading into the militaristic scream and snarl of ""Two Less Jacks"", which would not sound out of place on an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/"" target=""_blank"">Iceage</a> record. Total Control benefit immensely from a knack for rhythm—their circling, lurching guitar grooves often simulate the repetition of the minimal electronic found elsewhere. A sense of duality exists within the songs: the opener ""Bloody Glass"" is galactic and glossy with psychic, pinging beats, but it finds Stewart berating ""billionaires,"" ""thieves,"" and ""cowards"" alike, as if they are all synonymous. Its dreary delivery makes the imagery all the more sinister: ""Spitting on foreign lands/ On bloody stumps/ On glass/ We dance.""</p>
<p>Ghosts of new wave's past audibly haunt these songs, and ""Flesh War"" is <i>Typical System</i>'s most straightforward take on that sound. It's the widescreen, mechanical-sounding focal point, with synths soaring soft enough to rest your head on without worrying about getting clawed in the face. But it's not mere retro-styling. ""Flesh War"" looks for what's left in the endless possibilities of post-punk and says something real through it. The lyrics morbidly mutate: the ""breaking"" of the day becomes the cynical ""break-in"" of the day, and a prayer to ""news"" and ""fame"" becomes a play to ""noose"" and ""flame."" ""Carve a space inside your brain,"" the robotic Stewart sings, ""Earn enough of that cruel gaze/ And bear it 'til your back would break."" ""Flesh War"" sounds like commentary on life under the relentless watch of overlords—further proof that electronic pop can be just as subversive as throat-shredding rock and roll. Even with their most aesthetically orthodox track, Total Control's total message is radical.</p></div>"|19438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19438-total-control-typical-system/|8.0|Jenn Pelly

Although their people have lived in relative seclusion for centuries, their ancestors developed an impressively complex system of astronomy. The Dogon worship amphibious, extraterrestrial creatures called Nommos, who are believed to have travelled to earth from the distant star Sirius B. All of which might sound a little out there—until you learn that in the 20th century, modern astronomers were astonished to find how accurate the Dogon's ancient calculations were; somehow, centuries before telescopes, their ancestors had identified stars that were invisible to the naked eye. Leon was as taken with this mystery as he was with his growing collection of synthesizers. He decided to make an album of what he imagined would be playing ""on the Nommos's Walkman"" (""They would have had to listen to something on an interplanetary flight… otherwise it would have been very boring"") and, in a cosmic nod to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/313-the-anthology-of-american-folk-music-as-physical-artifact/"">Harry Smith</a>, give it the playful title<i> Anthology of Interplanetary Folk</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The resulting collection is a masterpiece of early electronic music—a precursor to later explorations in industrial music, new age, and ambient techno—but up until now, it's never been heard exactly how Leon intended. Leon composed the <i>Anthology </i>as two ""mirror image"" parts: The driving and metallic <i>Nommos </i>came out on John Fahey's Takoma label as a standalone LP in 1981, and its sequel, the softer and more subdued <i>Visiting</i> came out a year later. In the decades it's been out of print, <i>Nommos</i> in particular has been bootlegged repeatedly, and late last year the California label Superior Viaduct put out a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18553-craig-leon-nommos/"">reissue</a> of <i>Nommos</i> against Leon's wishes. ""I had always envisioned a different version of the album being the definitive version,"" Leon said, and so the 2013 release spurred him into taking control of the record's legacy. This new authorized reissue, put out with care by the Brooklyn label RVNG, finally presents Leon's otherworldly achievement exactly as he wanted it to be heard, with <i>Nommos</i> and <i>Visiting</i> side by side for the first time.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A cliche you often hear about early synth-based music is that it ""still sounds like something from the future,"" but what's interesting about <i>Anthology</i> is that it was always meant to sound like a transmission from the past. As his invented genre of ""interplanetary folk"" attests, Leon was drawn to the interplay of apparent opposites: antiquity and progress, earth and space, and, of course, new age and punk.<i> Anthology </i>is not an anthropological attempt to replicate (or colonize) the sounds of the Dogon tribe, but rather something more creative and personal—a sonic work of speculative fiction that uses ""new"" technology to imagine a time before recorded music. Neither primitive nor futuristic, it still has this uncanny feel of music that exists somewhere outside of time.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The atmosphere of <i>Nommos</i> is clanging and aqueous (because the Nommos could swim, Leon wanted to make it sound like music heard underwater). Driven by a mesmerizing polyrhythmic beat, ""Donkeys Bearing Cups"" is punctuated by sudden spurts of jagged-aluminum synths, while the incandescent ""Nommo"" lulls you into a gentler (though no less immersive) trance.<i> Anthology</i>'s centerpiece is <i>Nommos</i>' penultimate track, the haunting 15-minute reverie ""Four Eyes to See the Afterlife"", the last two-thirds of which build on a tinny loop and a wordless, interplanetary siren song voiced by Leon's wife and collaborator Cassell Webb. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Although it still captures a feeling of intergalactic awe, <i>Visiting</i> is meant to evoke a more terrestrial vibe than its companion piece. The bright and lively ""Region of Fleeing Civilians"" is the closest the collection comes to a straight-ahead synth-pop instrumental (complete with percussion that sounds like handclaps), and ""Visiting"" introduces a tranquilly lilting guitar into the atmosphere. As far as its earth-bound kindred spirits go, <i>Anthology </i>sounds attuned to the frequencies that had been coming out of Germany that decade: <i>Nommos</i>' ""She Wears a Hemispherical Skullcap"" has an ""Autobahn""-esque luminosity about it, while <i>Anthology</i>'s more muted moments echo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11733-cluster-eno-after-the-heat-begegnungen-begegnungen-ii/"">Brian Eno's work with Cluster</a>. Still, as Leon explains, the spirit of New York punk is pulsing through it, too. ""The Lower East Side scene was very involved in counterculture art and poetry,"" he recalled<a href=""http://bombmagazine.org/article/1000173/craig-leon"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> in a recent interview</a>. ""It became populist later, but if you look at Patti Smith, Television, Talking Heads, even the Ramones… <i>Nommos</i> fit in with that.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">The timing of this reissue couldn't be better. We're in middle of a modest but notable new age revival, when a new generation of listeners are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/secondhands/9312-new-age/"">reassessing</a> this often-misunderstood genre, discovering its pioneers, and uncovering its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18655-i-am-the-center-private-issue-new-age-music-in-america-1950-1990/"">hidden DIY roots</a>. Leon is a perfect embodiment of new age's unexpected punk past, and it would seem the world is only now catching up with his vision, over thirty years after his <i>Anthology</i> was released. A few months ago, I had the pleasure of seeing Leon play <i>Nommos</i> in full at the Greenwich Village venue Le Poisson Rouge, a short walk from the downtown clubs where he first saw Suicide and Patti Smith decades ago. His set featured spacey visual projections, and he and Webb were joined by the stylistically adventurous string ensemble ACME—which, actually, was how he envisioned this supposed synth-classic all along. ""It was meant to be orchestral,"" he admitted in a recent interview, ""but we didn't have any money!"" Like these performances, the definitive reissue finally brings Leon's landmark work full circle. <i>Anthology of Interplanetary Folk</i> is far from some kitschy relic of electronic music past; in fact, there may have never been a better time to join Leon for the ride.</p></div>"|19434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19434-craig-leon-anthology-of-interplanetary-folk-music-vol-1-nommosvisiting/|8.4|Lindsay Zoladz

Brothers Nick and Sam Wilkerson and frontman Tony Esposito do not appear to have any particular designs on world domination; for now, they're more interested in catching the eye of that insomniac gal across the room. Esposito and the Wilkerson boys won the favor of their native Louisville with their spring-loaded live shows, which they've more than ably translated to wax on this six-song EP. They're a young band, and like most young bands, they've still got a couple kinks left to be worked out. But, for now, their youthful exuberance—and a half-dozen blistering hooks—are suiting them just fine.<br/><br/>Opener ""Cool"" lights the fuse, then quickly explodes; within five seconds, they are off and running. Atop a tight-as-anything smear of fuzzbox guitar and Nick Wilkerson's 90 MPH rhythms, Esposito stars pitching woo. ""Oh-whoa, she's so cool,"" he sings in that classic American faux-Brit accent: a little bratty, and a whole lot smitten. And that, more or less, is White Reaper: revved-up, romantically inclined, hook-heavy punkers with a keen sense of their strengths and the good sense not to overextend themselves. ""Should we settle down?"" Esposito wonders halfway through ""Funn,"" then quickly provides his own answer: ""Oh, no.""<br/><br/>A Chuck Berry-inspired solo here and a touch of moddish organ there add a splash of color to the proceedings. But the appeal of White Reaper's music is mostly pretty black-and-white: these are catchy, undemanding songs, played beyond an inch of their lives. Esposito's quite the little howler; hard to say just how he'd fare with a ballad—the breathless <i>White Reaper</i> EP never slows down long enough to give him the chance—but when he opens wide, that wail of his is more than enough. Sam Wilkerson's bass gets a bit lost in the melee, but brother Nick's just about all the rhythm section anyone could need. Together, they blast through White Reaper's 16 minutes like sprinters looking to shave seconds off their time.<br/><br/>Is White Reaper's music formulaic? No question—but, when the energy's right and hooks are there, their formula works, and it's a perennial favorite of the drunk and disorderly. White Reaper's lyrics—mostly about cool girls of their acquaintance, their failure to not act ""so stu-pid"" around the aforementioned cool girls, and said cool girls' difficulties getting home by themselves in the wee hours of the morning—aren't exactly laden with nuance, and that's no accident: anything more would just slow them down. That they're so clearly indebted to a few well-known sources—the Ramones, the earliest inklings of British Invasion-era proto-punk, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7921-jay-reatard"">Jay Reatard</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/?"">Ty Segall</a> axis of the current garage-rock renaissance—simply places them in a tradition, one they seem plenty keen to pick up, if not necessarily run with.</p>
<p>It's true that there's a built-in ceiling with music this gleefully steeped in the past: White Reaper may do what they do well, but what they do has been done many times before. A little energy goes a long way with this stuff, and White Reaper's got energy to spare. But a little personality goes even further, and White Reaper could probably stand to get a little more of themselves into their music to help shake up the tried-and-true formula to which they've adhered themselves. Still, it's a mistake to assume every band can (or should) be important, or influential, or essential in some highfalutin' way. Some bands are just fun, and White Reaper are just that.</p></div>"|19537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19537-white-reaper-white-reaper-ep/|6.6|Paul Thompson

Conti gives diverse musical forms to phonemes and diphthongs by drawing on a sound vocabulary that is limited, but with nuanced differences of resonance and inflection. The music is somewhere between electronic ambient and post-classical sound art. Enigmatic themes for processed piano and guitar are humanized by manipulated field recordings of everyday things from amusement parks to insects. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">These compositions blend passages of airy light with dark, cloistered ones, as if traveling through patches of clearing and shade or through days and nights. When your landscape is an alphabet, scale is elusive.</span></p>
<p>Overall, the music is austerely sacred, melodically lush, and elegiac, highlighting the orphaned quality of isolated letters, which communicate clearly only in their connections to each other. There are dreamy duets and trios for high-contrast timbres, brooding piano ruminations, and acoustic sounds processed into grainy drones and clipped pulses. The spirit of the album is soft and pensive, but tightly coiled; it periodically gathers to peaks of compressed fury (""H""). Conti has a graceful way with flickers of mottled counterpoint (""I"" and ""J""), differentiating his simple, revolving motifs. He packs satisfying amounts of development into short pieces while preserving their discrete musical perimeters. </p>
<p>Occasionally, the relationship between letter and sound is obvious—satisfyingly so in the cases of vowels, such as the choral aspiration of ""A"" and the shivery shriek of ""E"". Elsewhere, linking letters such as ""C"" and ""G"" to their corresponding notes feels like a slight failure of imagination. But mostly, the interpretations are infinitely subjective, engaging the listener's imagination. At times, Conti captures the audible contours of a letter's sound, at others, its visual shape. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">""K"" makes you suddenly hear that consonant's curt bite in the piano's upper octaves</span></span>, while the tightly swiveling sequence of ""L"" evokes turning back and forth through the letterform's right angle.</p>
<p>The brilliant ""B"" combines both approaches: t<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">here are voluptuous curves in the piano</span></span> and a ""buh""-like sound in the root note of the guitar figure. ""N"" and its tilde-bearing cousin are woven together in a lattice of bird song and tolling church bells that feels so notably sacrosanct you wonder if they have personal significance for Conti. The exhaling drones of ""H"" seem on the verge of asking ""Who?"" and then, as the intensity increases, ""Help!"" ""S"" has a sibilant thrum, slithering on a cushion of air. ""V"" almost vanishes, repeatedly tapering down into a silent vacuum. ""X"" is a burst of busy, crisscrossing speed before the closing lullaby of ""Z"".</p>
<p>Conti reveals letters to be so swollen with associations that his slender tracks feel like larger metaphorical conduits than they should rightfully be. The composer renews our sense of connection to these strange, almost invisibly familiar little squiggles of code, turning us into sonic cryptographers. Like the alphabet, the small pieces, in sum, seem to contain everything in the world—a luxuriously full compendium of meaning, if only we could put it in the right order to reveal it.</p></div>"|19558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19558-ulises-conti-the-greeks-believed-that-the-stars-were-small-holes-where-the-gods-listened-to-men/|7.5|Brian Howe

Ambitious as Mastodon’s concepts were, they avoided pretension by grounding their lofty thematics in crunchy, timeless riffage and a cross-pollinated sound combining </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">’s doom, </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/electricwizarddorsetdoom?_fb_noscript=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Electric Wizard</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">’s gloom, and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2297-king-crimson/"">King Crimson</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">’s hyper-literate mad genius. And so, four guys from Atlanta quickly earned the reputations as metal’s smartest, most unstoppable band of barbarians. </span>If anyone could cross over, they could.</p>
<p class=""p3"">So it's easy to understand why, when Mastodon’s elemental epic reached its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12872-crack-the-skye/"">conclusion in 2009</a>, they were tempted to set aside the prog epics in search of a new aural identity, one that could sublimate the esoteric monoliths of old into an accessible and mature sound.  To some, the end product of that venture, 2011’s Mike Elizondo-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15880-the-hunter/""><span class=""s1""><i>The Hunter</i></span></a><i>, </i>constituted Mastodon’s jumping-the-Megalodon moment: too poppy, too giddy, and downright flimsy when compared to the steely grooves of the past. The prospect of a major metal album overseen by a superproducer like Elizondo struck many as sacrilege, but after a decade of weak-tea rock on the major labels, one couldn’t help but feel thrilled at the prospect of four storytellers re-shaping the world of popular heavy music.</p>
<p class=""p3""><i>Once More ‘Round the Sun,</i> the band’s latest,<i> </i>tempers the mixtape approach of its predecessor. Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, Alice in Chains) was tapped to produce this time, and he brings a comparatively raw sound. Troy Sanders returns with a vastly improved vocal range, one honed in the groove-driven supergroup <a href=""http://www.killerbekilled.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Killer Be Killed</a>, and Brent Hinds remains the best screamer of the group—though it’s a shame he doesn’t get more opportunities to show it off. Occasionally their tag-team approach matches Mastodon’s lofty standards, as on the title-track, which deserves special mention for that goosebump-raising chord progression in the bridge. But the thin, uninspired harmonies gets taxing by the album’s proggier second half, and on the whole, <i>Once More ’Round the Sun </i>is easily the band’s weakest effort to date. </p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s3"">For two records now, Mastodon have jettisoned the overarching concepts of old for a simpler mission: to be a hard rock band making hard rock records. Clearly, though, they’re not willing to abandon their proggy roots entirely, leaving listeners (as well as themselves) trapped between two modes: the straightforward wallop of Foo Fighters-style rock, and the hard, nasty sludge of old. They never fully commit to either extreme, resulting in a frustratingly liminal listen.</span></p>
<p class=""p3"">Throughout the majority of the album, those mammoth styles remain in constant collision with each other, often within the same song. Opener “Tread Lightly” sets the template: Mastodon churn out a slithering groove, segue into a good-not-great verse-chorus-verser adorned with some cool flourishes, and then launch headlong into a warped solo from guitarist Brent Hinds and some psychedelic noodling, culminating in a satisfactory raucous conclusion. Frequently, however, the band simply shrug and end with a bridge to nowhere (“Feast Your Eyes“), a lazy fade-out (“Chimes at Midnight”), or worse.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Sudden transitions are certainly not without precedent in Mastodon’s case—they’re one of the reasons why, even a decade later, <i>Leviathan </i>remains so memorable. But where that album used abrupt transitions to lead the listener further down the chute toward the abyss, <i>Once More ‘Round the Sun </i>leaves us with some undecipherable head scratchers, like the ""Hey-ho/ Let’s fucking rock and roll"" coda provided by Mastodon’s Atlanta punk pals the Coathangers, on the math-y “Aunt Lisa”.</p>
<p class=""p3""><i>Once More 'Round the Sun</i> is also marked by an overarching aimlessness. Brent Hinds has said that the band pushed for a “stream-of-consciousness” approach on this LP, but too often, the looseness diminishes the possibility of catharsis. “Aunt Lisa” and closer “Diamond in the Witch House”, a collaboration with recurring guest Scott Kelly of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"">Neurosis</a>, pack plenty of momentum, but they waste it on clumsy transitions and Kelly’s directionless conclusion. Lead single ""High Road"" fares far better, proving the band's alt-rock worthiness in a rare show of discipline combining crunchy guitars, a belt-ready chorus, and a cheekily victorious solo.</p>
<p class=""p3""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">“This time things’ll work out just fine,” sings Dailor as he pummels the kit into submission on “The Motherload”, probably the band’s vaguest rocker to date. “We won’t let you slip away.” That's not the kind of promise you’d expect from a band so previously obsessed with white whales and holy grails, but as the Georgia titans continue their slow-but-rightful ascent to the throne of mainstream heavy music—a prospect that necessitates a less caustic approach—it’s understandable they’d want to stick their heads over the fourth wall. As proud rejectors of such restrictions, metal fans are all to quick to conflate heightened accessibility with a deliberate betrayal of their extreme upbringing, and surely the quartet are aware of this.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">With all that in mind, it's possible to view <i>Once More 'Round the Sun</i> as a vow to honor their roots, even as they set out in search of broader horizons. So far, however, Mastodon’s paradigms</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> simply don’t mesh the way they should. Evolution takes time, and Mastodon continue to publicly work out their growing pains as they determine which traits best represent the unified sound they’ve been chasing this decade.</span></p></div>"|19471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19471-once-more-round-the-sun/|6.3|Zoe Camp

Few of them really seemed to really relish the role, and the ones who stand out most, looking back from two decades later, were women: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1763-kim-gordon/"" target=""_blank"">Kim Gordon</a>, Courtney Love, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"" target=""_blank"">Royal Trux</a> frontwoman Jennifer Herrema.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>While their contemporaries were imploding the classic rock golden-god mythos through a truculent refusal to follow the rulebook, Herrema and Royal Trux's Neil Hagerty, were accomplishing something similar by emulating its sickest qualities. Falling half-accidentally into a pile of the major label cash that was flying around, Herrema and Hagerty put that money into drugs and druggy records that achieved the same kind of squalid junkie transcendence as <i>Exile on Main Street</i>, with far less romanticism. Their carton-a-day croaks and fucked-up frames represented ""heroin chic"" taken to its scabrous logical conclusion, and they reveled in its repulsiveness to an extent that terminally disconcerted much of the audience that their often achingly beautiful records deserved. The whole project sounded filthy and, somehow, glorious.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Unlike a good deal of her contemporaries, Herrema’s continued evolving as an artist since the '90s. After her partnership with Hagerty dissolved following 2000's <i>Pound for Pound</i>, which explored Southern rock and the coke-addled disco side of the late-'70s Stones, she formed and fronted RTX, which added a scuzzy streak of hair metal into the mix. With her latest group, Black Bananas, she’s dragged that whole pile of classic rock influences into the present day. The group’s first album, 2012’s <i>Rad Times Xpress IV</i>, was a weird mishmash of stoner grooves, flamboyant hair metal, and the seedier side of the contemporary club scene, the results sounding like someone dragged 1984-era David Lee Roth into at a basement DJ night and filled him full of cough syrup. It was a mess, but like most messes Herrema’s involved in, it was compelling.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Electric Brick Wall</i> is a far more coherent synthesis of those disparate influences, and possibly her strongest record since the Trux’s peak. The album's <span>female-fronted pileup of overblown drum machines and retro guitar riffage</span> shares surface similarities with Sleigh Bells, but instead of that band's shimmering, pixellated gleam, Black Bananas give off a debauched, grimy aura. When they evoke the Sunset Strip in the '80s it’s not the fictionalized version served up by the Motley Crüe wannabes of the time but the seedy real-life version, with rumbling rap beats mixed in for kicks.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>At other points, the group ditches its retro references and shoots for an almost purely contemporary sound, which Herrema’s seldom attempted previously. “Give It to Me” is a slick (by her standards) take on dance floor electro-pop, while “Physical Emotions” is their take on straight-up radio R&amp;B, complete with Auto-Tune; even with the requisite amount of distortion that they slather on it, it still has a modern sheen that even listeners attuned to Herrema’s wild stylistic impulses won’t see coming. After years spent ransacking the past, she’s turned her sights on the here and now, and it’s as fucked-up and fascinating as anything she’s ever done.</span></p></div>"|19443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19443-black-bananas-electric-black-wall/|7.7|Miles Raymer

These projects are sometimes reminiscent of Hot Chip, while almost always stopping short of the band's classic sound. Both on his own and as part of house-loving duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28740-the-2-bears/"">the 2 Bears</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8594-joe-goddard/"">Joe Goddard</a> has explored the group's beat-driven, clubby side, while Al Doyle and Felix Martin have zeroed in on dance’s comedown moments, first with the stately, short-lived Lanark (whose elegant “The Stone the Builder Rejected” appeared on Hot Chip’s excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10250-dj-kicks/""><i>DJ-Kicks</i></a> mix from 2007) and then as part of the more downtempo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29934-new-build/"">New Build</a> project.</p>
<p>Similar to Goddard, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7725-alexis-taylor/"">Alexis Taylor</a> also works on his own and as part of a group, releasing two records over the past three years with his avant-pop outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28299-about/"">About Group</a>, which also features members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4216-this-heat"">This Heat</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a>. Without hearing a note of music, the group’s collective pedigree suggests that their music might be more difficult than Hot Chip’s glimmering, weird accessibility—indeed, they initially came together in 2009 to record an under-the-radar record of improvisational music. But although their music has lacked immediacy, it still hews closely to traditional songwriting forms, merging the yacht-rock predilections that have cropped up on Taylor-sung Hot Chip songs with a soft-focus songwriting approach reminiscent of one-time Taylor collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4629-robert-wyatt/"">Robert Wyatt</a>.</p>
<p>Taylor’s solo work doesn’t so much diverge from his work in About Group as it does resemble a more isolated version of that band’s loosely drawn style, slotting abstract sound experiments alongside simple songs that lean on a one main hook. (About Group is definitely the main reference point for Taylor’s solo endeavors; other than that solemnly gorgeous, church-like voice of his, his own material is so far removed from the Hot Chip canon that it barely resembles the band’s work at all.) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12460-rubbed-out/""><i>Rubbed Out</i></a> from 2008 carried a cheeky title that doubled as an explanation for the record’s off-the-cuff sound (“There wasn’t any thinking behind it, really,” he told <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/hot-chip/40482"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>NME</i></a> at the time) and last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17488-nayim-from-the-halfway-line/""><i>Nayim from the Halfway Line</i></a> EP leaned hard on experimentation, serving as a depository for stray ideas. His latest solo effort, <i>Await Barbarians</i>, kicks off with a red herring to suggest that the listener’s in for more of the same: the two-minute “Lazy Bones” is all aimlessly plunked tones, with the occasional pitch-bend that gives the track a first-time-using-a-keyboard feel.</p>
<p>Luckily, the slight piece of music isn’t representative of what follows, instead acting as a portal for an intimate collection of home-recorded, structurally melodic songs. Much of <i>Await Barbarians</i> is intrinsically catchy, in the way that most simple, basically pleasing melodies will get stuck in your head after one or two listens. Part of this is due to Taylor’s honeyed vocals, which could make even a takeout menu sound exquisitely melancholy, but the highlights suggest that Taylor’s capable of writing engaging songs even on his own. “Without a Crutch”, the melody and title of which appears twice on <i>Await Barbarians</i>, sways and swings with warm instrumentation that could make for a serviceable sitcom theme song; the dusky, anti-gravity pull of “Immune System” resembles a stripped-down take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3151-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark/"">OMD</a>’s more downtempo moments, while the main melodic figure of “Am I Not a Soldier?” gently cascades on a bed of dry drum machine hits and slow-hand guitar.</p>
<p>Much of Hot Chip’s music has gives back whatever feelings the listener puts into it; that is to say, they’re not the most direct band lyrically, and even at their most personal they maintain a distance. In the closing moments of 2012’s kaleidoscopic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16706-in-our-heads/""><i>In Our Heads</i></a>, Taylor briefly broke that spell with the moony-eyed devotional “Always Been Your Love”, but on <i>Await Barbarians</i> he seems to have retreated back into his shell again, to the point where when he sings “Everyone knows what I mean” over the jagged guitar of “From the Halfway Line”, it seems like he’s having a laugh. Wit has certainly played a large role in Hot Chip’s work, especially their earlier records, and on <i>Await Barbarians</i> a sense of humor occasionally rears its head. “If I don’t know where I am today/ It’s not because I’m far away,” he jauntily sings on the album’s first iteration of “Without a Crutch”, following it up with a sorry-not-sorry sense of defeatism: “Or even ‘cause I drink too much/ Or then again, not quite enough.”</p>
<p>Listen hard enough and a few other glimmers of fascination eventually rise out of the album’s low-stakes murk—tucked away in the funereal march of ”Elvis Has Left the Building” is what could possibly be a strange allusion to Whitney Houston’s passing in 2011. But the downtempo trudge and repetitive structures of <i>Await Barbarians</i> are ultimately too imposing to demand the close attention they require. And that’s okay: at his best, Taylor has sounded like someone caught up in the rapture of self, a beatific presence unconcerned with what’s around him, so a solo album made by himself and <i>for</i> himself isn’t necessarily surprising. Given what he’s proven capable of as part of his main gig, though, it’s hard not to wish that, when left to his own devices, he made more of an effort to get outside of his own head.</p></div>"|19455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19455-alexis-taylor-await-barbarians/|5.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

<p>Bauer’s musical palette is broad and unique, expanding past the sounds of his previous band: he implements polyrhythmic island music on the the title track, the sounds of slow 1960s beat bands on “Shiva the Destroyer”, and true American heartland rock on “Irish Wake In Varanasi (For Big Pete Devlin)”. The opening track “I Was Born in An Ashram” doubles as biographical fodder—Bauer was, indeed, born in an ashram—and as a means of setting up <i>Liberation!</i>'s theme shambling along the path to personal nirvana. He sings about<i> </i>religion and the “freedom” it affords as if he were taking part in a classic-rock exorcism, which is evident in his singing voice, moving between a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile"">Kurt Vile</a>-esque drawl and a pursed-lip <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23555-mick-jagger/"">Mick Jagger</a> croon. Accordingly, the music occasionally takes on the lo-fi pluck of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12953-constant-hitmaker-god-is-saying-this-to-you/""><i>Constant Hitmaker</i></a> and the swagger-psych of <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Their_Satanic_Majesties_Request"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Their Satanic Majesties Request</a>. </i></p>
<p>Orthodox Hinduism, Scientology, Christianity, and religious hokum all receive lashings from Bauer’s sharp tongue. Rather than possessing the snide reproach of a message-board atheist, Bauer comes across as someone choosing to embrace mystery as its own religion, as terrifying as that may be. “Only you can convince yourself,” he sings on “Shaved Heads &amp; Pony Tails”, which ma ybe the first indie rock song about a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikha"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>śikhā</i></a>;<span> the album's true mantra comes on the final track, where Bauer exalts over a two-chord stadium-ready tune, “You are the chapel, and everything is wonder."" Elsewhere, he lets his voice go on album closer “You Are the Chapel”, dialing into the talk-anthem spirit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Bruce Springsteen</a>, while underneath the drums thunder louder than any other instrument featured on the album. It’s a great closing anthem made even better by an errant Oasis diss: “I see you looking like Oasis/ why does anyone want to look like Oasis?”</span></p>
<p><i>Liberation! </i>is most successful as a shaking off of Bauer's relative anonymity: he paints himself as a funny guy, an American wanderer, and someone eager to expel what’s been boiling underneath those bass parts for the Walkmen for so many years. Perhaps that’s why this album sounds like such an impulsive, energetic mishmash that all comes out in a fury, as <i>Liberation! </i>doesn’t feel dwelled-upon or over-wrought. There are points, like his off-handed “ooo’s” at the end of “Latin American Ficciones”, that could stand to be more filled out, and sometimes the bare-bones production seems too small for the ideal size of the songs. But the ramshackle spontaneity is Bauer’s charm, as the songwriting compliments the heady spiritualism of his words. <i>Liberation!</i> gives Bauer a voice, and the mystery of where he goes next is just as exciting for us as it is for him.</p></div>"|19470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19470-peter-matthew-bauer-liberation/|7.2|Jeremy D.

Alongside Crowbar and Down (both of whom are also riding high on recent releases), they are the quintessential Southern sludge band, and were instrumental in articulating and perfecting that bleak, swaggering metal-meets-punk sound that frontman Mike Williams still calls “heavy blues”. While it’s easy to wax romantic over what Eyehategod friend and occasional collaborator Phil Anselmo once dismissively referred to as “the Southern slow jam thing, whiskey that, rebel this,” Eyehategod are so much more than their backstory. (And, anyway, Mike prefers vodka.) The New Orleans institution refuses to either take themselves too seriously or be made victims of their own mythology. They’re just here to play, and if you have a problem with that, well, they’re tougher than they look, and they already look pretty damn tough.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In the many years since they started the band and released 1989’s <i>Garden Dwarf Woman Driver</i> demo, Eyehategod’s core members have collectively survived the worst luck imaginable. They’ve been battered by hurricane winds, crippling addiction, jail time, depression, and ultimately, death; they've welcomed new drummer Aaron Hill into the fold following the untimely passing of original sticksman Joey LaCaze in 2013. LaCaze’s signature drumming style married swaggering looseness with a powerful physicality, and his presence is felt all over the band’s new self-titled album. It’s a fitting epitaph for such a larger-than-life talent, and an excellent sign for the future. </span></p>
<p>The release of<i> Eyehategod </i>has been a long time coming: the band took their sweet time dithering over album titles and labels, and the recording process was waylaid by fitful stops and starts, as it began at legendary <i>Dopesick</i> producer Billy Anderson’s studio, paused, and was resumed at Anselmo’s home studio alongside Down producer Steve Berrigan. Anselmo’s Housecore label signed on to the release resulting album, which marks the now-quartet’s first full-length studio recording since 2000’s <i>Confederacy of Ruined Lives</i>. The smoke's since cleared, and the resulting eleven-song testament is well worth the wait.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“Agitation! Propaganda!” is a full-bore rager that sounds more like Williams’ hardcore punk side project Arson Anthem than anything else. Eyehategod has always written fast songs, but they’ve never opened an album like <i>this</i> before; typically, they've preferred to catch their listeners off-guard with a mid-album burst like <i>Dopesick</i>'s “Methamphetamine”, or kick things off with a bait-and-switch a la “Blank” on <i>Take As Needed For Pain</i>. For a few nerve-wracking moments, you’re left wondering whether Eyehategod have burrowed way back down to their punk roots and abandoned the heavy altogether, but halfway through the song those dirty Delta blues riffs force their way back in, and from then on, it’s business as usual. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Eyehategod</i> resembles the band's most classic work through and through, from the abject aural misery on “Robitussin and Rejection” to the feedback-heavy “Flags and Cities Bound”, the latter of which sees Williams dip into one of his wild-eyed spoken word rants. Jimmy Bower and Brian Patton are in fine form as they pass leaden blues riffs back and forth, teasing out grooves and smashing into teeth-out blasts of intensity when the mood strikes. </span><span>They have some fun, too; “Worthless Rescue” catches them smuggling in a straight-up Southern rock riff under loads of distortion, and the “Framed to the Wall” gives them another chance to wrestle with sweaty punk riffs before stalling back down into syrupy sludge. </span><span>Bassist Gary Mader’s got the most heavy lifting to do across the board, matching LaCaze’s apocalyptic beats and anchoring the whole unsteady mess with dependably solid skill while Williams throttles both the mic and his own beleaguered vocal chords with a perverse alacrity. Acidic and unpredictable, you’d never guess just how many times Williams’ voice has been put through the ringer. As always with Eyehategod, those scars are internal.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The band has been playing several of these songs live for years, and there’s a reason “Medicine Noose” and “Nobody Told Me” have become set staples. The manic-depressive “Medicine Noose” is a lumbering behemoth of a song with a thick, patient central riff that promises big and delivers bigger, and the perfectly-executed  “Nobody Told Me” is the best song they’ve written in years, with a perfect riff that's exactly what fans would ask for if Williams, Bower, and the fellas pulled them into the practice space for input. “The Age of Bootcamp” has William wailing like a sick animal atop a familiar punishing groove that, more than anything else, signals that Eyehategod is back, and they aren’t going anywhere. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You’ve got to admire the sheer force of will that has brought Eyehategod to this point. After fourteen years, they’ve come out swinging, armed with yet another of their often-renewed leases on life and still spoiling for a fight. That <i>Eyehategod</i> exists at all is a miracle in and of itself, but the fact that it is so damn great is simply extraordinary.</span></p></div>"|19381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19381-eyehategod-eyehategod/|8.0|Kim Kelly

Over the course of several albums, the intercontinental six-piece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5171-a-sunny-day-in-glasgow"">A Sunny Day in Glasgow</a> have been toying with an answer to that riddle. Their latest and best record, <i>Sea When Absent</i>, has an atmospheric, bleeding-watercolor quality that makes it sound a little bit like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> record if the moodiness and pensiveness were replaced with a feeling of almost violently explosive joy. Beneath dense textures, melodies pop like fireworks. Like their previous albums, <i>Sea When Absent </i>doesn't sound like much else out there; genre tags are only worth mentioning to show how they don't quite fit. It sometimes sounds like a psych record, made not by the kids smoking up behind the bleachers but the most devoted members of the glee club.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Since their freewheeling 2007 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10005-scribble-mural-comic-journal/""><i>Scribble Mural Comic Journal</i></a>, A Sunny Day in Glasgow have flown under the radar, apart from any discernible trends. Until now, their greatest achievement has been their criminally under-heard 2009 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13440-ashes-grammar/""><i>Ashes Grammar</i></a>, a panoramic collection of pastel-soft dream-pop that moved fluidly between ambient passages and hazy but immaculately structured pop songs like ""Failure"" and ""Passionate Introverts (Dinosaurs)"". Actually, ""passionate introverts"" is a pretty good way to describe at least one member of the band: the guitarist and ostensible leader Ben Daniels, a biostatistician who moved in 2009 from Philadelphia to Australia. ""I am pretty antisocial,"" he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9441-a-sunny-day-in-glasgow/"">said recently</a>, when asked if he still felt connected to the Philadelphia scene. ""I know that if I were in Philly I'd still mostly be hanging out in my apartment reading books and playing with synthesizers."" That makes sense: Even in its most ambitiously full-screen moments, A Sunny Day in Glasgow's music has a certain bedroom-pop feel. Community often makes for great art, but music as unique and unclassifiable as ASDIG's usually springs from somebody shutting himself in his room and trusting his own weird way of seeing the world.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Ashes Grammar</i> was a sprawling and occasionally drifting record, but <i>Sea When Absent</i> finds the band tightening up their sound just enough, bringing the interlocking vocals of their two singers, Jen Goma and Annie Fredrickson, to the forefront of the mix. For the first time, they've brought on an outside producer, <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jeff-zeigler-mn0001317162/credits"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Zeigler</a> (War on Drugs, Kurt Vile), and though he's helped clarify their sound, that doesn't come at the expense of complexity. Each song on <i>Sea When Absent</i> structured like a maze: it's easy—and dizzying in the best way—to get lost in its twists and turns. ""The Things They Do to Me"" begins as weightless, space-rock reverie and then abruptly makes a hard left into a more pastoral earth-bound soundscape; ""The Body, It Bends"" pivots between an unassuming acoustic folk tune and a song that ought to have its own laser light show at a planetarium; a towering riff crashes down in the middle of ""Boys Turn Into Girls (Initiation Rites)"", sudden as a summer storm. These tonal shifts are so dynamic that they sound fresh on every listen; you could hear these songs 100 times and they'd still find ways to catch by surprise.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Music that overflows with so many ideas runs the risk of sounding cluttered, but <i>Sea When Absent</i> manages to avoid that pitfall. And that's pretty impressive, given the disjointed way it was recorded: The six members of the band (Daniels, Goma, Fredrickson, drummer Adam Herndon, bassist Ryan Newmyer, and multi-instrumentalist Josh Meakim) are now scattered across Australia, New York, and Philadelphia, and the album came together as they sent each other snippets of songs, with creative decisions made via lengthy group email chains. The result is an album structured in layers with many overlapping ideas, as fragmentary and luminous as light through a prism. The sweetly singsong-y ""MTLOV (Minor Keys)"" has the feel of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_(music)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">round</a>, with Goma and Fredrickson's voices braided into rich harmonies. Then there's the stone-cold gorgeous ""In Love With Useless (The Timeless Geometry in the Tradition of Passing)"", which flirts with moments of dissonance and glitchiness (the pre-chorus sounds like nothing so much as a poorly connected Skype call) only to make the moments of sudden clarity feel that much more satisfying.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When A Sunny Day in Glasgow put out ""In Love With Useless"" as a single, they also released a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wnC5B_CAp4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lyric video</a> for it—which is kind of funny, because they're not exactly a ""lyrics band."" Granted, they've pushed the vocals higher into the mix this time around, but it's usually next to impossible to understand what Goma and Fredrickson are singing. Not that it matters; ASDIG's music is more about the experience of getting blissfully lost in a feeling, and if their music were too literal or word-based it might take you out of that odd, dreamlike state.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""When <i>Ashes Grammar</i> came out,"" Daniels recently recalled, ""I thought it was a really loud rock record for a year, and then a friend was like, 'This is really chilled-out and ambient.'"" With <i>Sea When Absent</i>, A Sunny Day in Glasgow have finally made that loud rock record—full of crashing percussion and screaming guitars—but without abandoning the ambiance that makes them so distinct. <i>Sea When Absent</i> has the quality of one of those spectacularly bright summer days when they color in everything seems a little over-saturated, and it induces the same dizzy, woozy feeling you get after staring directly at the sun. Play it loud enough to see spots.</p></div>"|19478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19478-a-sunny-day-in-glasgow-sea-when-absent/|8.5|Lindsay Zoladz

The guitars swell and crash around him, then lumber into the kind of crunchy jam that once upon a time had teenage misfits pumping fists or raising lighters in unison. Given that the song is set in Indiana, JM could conceivably be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8114-john-mellencamp/"">John Mellencamp</a>, the Hoosier rocker laureate who used to sing about such kids, but in fact Showalter has disclosed the song’s true subject: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2899-jason-molina/"">Jason Molina</a>. “JM” is a moving tale of extreme adolescent alienation, alleviated only by the narrator’s identification with a rock hero, in this case one whose locality as a Midwesterner—and sometime Indianan—makes him all the more relatable, more approachable, more real.</p>
<p>“JM” is the lynchpin on Strand of Oaks’ fourth album, <i>HEAL</i>, in that it shows two different versions of Showalter: the angry, potentially violent teen blasting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26175-songs-ohia/"">Songs: Ohia</a> and the adult who now knows Molina’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/afterword/9087-jason-molina/"">fate</a>. The song’s power lies not only in its barrage of guitars, but in the sad wisdom gleaned from fallen heroes. On all of these songs, Showalter comes across as the kind of character Molina certainly identified with and occasionally wrote about: a blue-collar, dead-end kid with an uncertain future and some darkness in him. <i>HEAL</i> is an album as memoir: stark and at times emotionally harrowing as it recounts with bracing candor the artist’s struggles with friends, family, and most of all himself. The choruses may swoop and soar, the guitars may churn valiantly, but Showalter’s nostalgia for his own past is never rosy. There are still hints of shame and self-loathing in his voice, as though he is still very much the kid he sings about.</p>
<p>“Shame” and “self-loathing” are not words often used to describe great rock records—at least not those made outside the 1990s, when personal darkness became rock’s eventually tiresome subject matter. The songs on <i>HEAL</i>, however, are more than just therapy sessions; in fact, they reveal an idiosyncratic artist rummaging through his memories to find the source of his art. Opener “Goshen '97”, named after Showalter’s hometown in the northern part of the state, describes his first stabs at making music, buying beat-up Casios, “singing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"">Pumpkins</a> in the mirror” and finding his dad’s tape machine. The details are so vivid you hardly mind that he tries to sneak the line, “That’s where the magic began,” by you. The song describes a lonely kid finding some comfort in music and some camaraderie in his musical idols, so it’s perfectly apt that guitar hero <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"">J Mascis</a> (another JM) shreds his way through “Goshen '97”.</p>
<p><i>HEAL</i> follows the young Showalter through his teenage years and into his twenties, as he becomes, in his own words, “fat, drunk, and mean.” Showalter’s self-assessment can certainly be grizzly (“I was an abomination”), but he couches everything in vivid scenes: stashing porn under the bed, listening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"">Sharon Van Etten</a> on his headphones, drinking a jug of wine to summon the courage to ask a girl home. This autobiographical mode is unusual for Showalter, who as Strand of Oaks has not mined his own life for material—at least, not to the extent he does here. Rather than rely on the typical confessional models that inform so much indie-rock and -folk songwriting, his earlier songs addressed subjects that rarely, if ever, get sung about. This is a man who penned a revenge fantasy of Dan Ackroyd torturing John Belushi’s dealer. It’s not that those songs were impersonal; rather, they portrayed him as an artist trying to find his reflection in the mirror of the world.</p>
<p>On <i>HEAL</i>, it’s not just the lyrics that are memoiristic, but the music as well. These songs draw on the pop songs of Showalter’s youth—not just Molina’s epic Americana, but also postpunk synth pop and heavy metal. If Strand of Oaks started as a primarily acoustic folk act, it has morphed into something very different. There is lots of pre-grunge guitar on here: some actual shredding and soloing, albeit no showboating. Synths play a much larger role on <i>HEAL</i>, especially on the neon-lit title track and on “Same Emotions”, with its video-game solo on the coda. It’s a way for Showalter to map his own past musically, to fit his memories with a soundtrack based on what might have been playing when he bought that first keyboard or asked that girl out.</p>
<p>There’s a rawness to <i>HEAL</i>, a damaged quality to the music, as though Showalter—who played almost all of the instruments—recorded everything in the old Goshen basement with his first rickety keyboards. The title track burbles with beats and synths that might be described “postpunk” or “motorik”, but really they just sound like a guy fucking around with a Casio. That only makes the whoa-oa-oa’s on “Woke Up to the Light” and closer “Wait for Love” sound too easy, an obvious means of conveying gravity and implying transcendence. Such moments are too similar to the wordless anthemizing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>, which makes them too public and too current; they break the spell. As a result, the album loses some of its urgency, its specificity, and its narrative thrust as it progresses. But that won’t matter to the angry kid who discovers <i>HEAL</i> and blasts it in his own car. </p></div>"|19536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19536-strand-of-oaks-heal/|7.9|Stephen M.

Geddes Gengras' latest release, <i>Ishi</i>, possesses that functionality. The experimental artist's new LP comes off of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16513-icon-give-thank/"">two avant-reggae</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17526-icon-give-life/"">albums he recorded</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28951-sun-araw/"">Sun Araw</a> and Jamaican legends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13147-the-congos"">the Congos</a>, as well as last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18400-m-geddes-gengras-collected-works-vol-1-the-moog-years/""><i>Collected Works Vol. 1 The Moog Years</i></a>, a collection of compositions for modular synthesizer that existed somewhere in between John Carpenter’s creepiest film scores and the more electronics-based parts of last year’s compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18655-i-am-the-center-private-issue-new-age-music-in-america-1950-1990/""><i>I Am The Center: Private Issue New Age Music In America 1950-1990</i></a>.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Ishi</i> finds Gengras continuing to take cues from the latter comparison point: its three tracks flow into each other subtly enough to qualify as passages rather than discrete songs, building and releasing with a patient determination. The music moves unhurriedly from moment to moment in a way that traces the clear outline a strong compositional foundation, producing an atmosphere that's both serene and substantial.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s tempting to call <i>Ishi</i> ambient music, but it possesses too much presence to fade into the background. It possesses an insistence that just stops short of dominating your attention. Although Gengras’ current mode relies heavily on slow-attack synth pads, he frequently works in dissonant leads and unexpectedly harsh tones that can disrupt the peaceful mood you might find yourself lulled into. It’s a soothing record, but one that’ll still keep you on your toes.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Combined with the rich synthesizer sounds that Gengras comes up with, that serene quality means <i>Ishi</i> is a good record to keep handy (along with a pair of good headphones). It's a sonically dense record, with deep, sustained low end and deft arrangements that are complicated but not cluttered. The bass lines move at whale-song pace throughout, above which bits of melody—flickering clusters of sequenced notes, sounds that resemble synthesized wind—fade in and out hypnogogically.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Ishi</i> is remarkably well designed to block out the world around you. The serene energy it gives off it makes for an effective psychic refuge—put it on in a train station during rush hour and it immediately begins to block out the atmospheric anxiety hovering over the crowd, like an umbrella against the rain. The headspace it produces is calming but frequently, dreamily surreal, and it often seems like a better place to live than the world outside it.</p></div>"|19439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19439-m-geddes-gengras-ishi/|7.6|Miles Raymer

A classically trained pianist, AWOL soldier, male prostitute, fledgling West Coast folksinger, cast member of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_(musical)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Hair</i></a>, psychiatric-hospital patient, and an openly gay man at a time when even hippy-prescribed free love had its boundaries, the Pennsylvania army brat born Bruce Campbell had already lived several script-worthy lives even before his fateful 1972 encounter with music-biz mogul Jerry Brandt. Under the former Carly Simon manager's tutelage, Campbell—then already performing under the name Jobriath Boone—was reborn as a mononymmed glamboyant androgyne who made even David Bowie seem timid by comparison.</p>
<p>However, Jobriath’s story proved to be a tragic textbook case of how fame cannot be automatically attained through six-figure record contracts and Times Square billboard campaigns alone—particularly amid a musical mainstream <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctg5FCS1wCM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">not exactly tolerant of heterosexual rockers in high heels</a>, let alone an unabashedly queer one. After two lavishly produced but woefully underselling albums, Jobriath’s star had flamed out as quickly as it had ignited. Consigned to the Chelsea lounge-singer circuit, his profile would sink so low that, as legend has it, when ardent admirer Morrissey tried to book Jobriath to open his 1992 <i>Your Arsenal tour</i>, even he didn’t know that Campbell had been dead for nearly a decade, a casualty of the early '80s AIDS outbreak. </p>
<p>Thanks in part to Moz’s ardent boosterism, Jobriath has, over the past decade, been elevated from glam-rock also-ran/laughingstock into a mini-cottage-industry, with Rhino reissues of his discography and a recent documentary, <i><a href=""http://jobriaththemovie.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jobriath A.D.</a></i>, testifying to his enduring influence on everyone from Def Leppard belter Joe Elliott to performance artist Ann Magnuson (who <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1201608367/ann-magnusons-the-jobriath-medley-a-glam-rock-fair"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently crowd-funded an EP inspired by his life and songs</a>). However, <i>As the River Flows</i> adds an intriguing new dimension to his limited recorded legacy. So much of the Jobriath mythos is defined by grandiosity—the fantastical fashions, the balcony-pitched pomp-rock overtures, the titanic hype, the spectacular failure. But as a collection of previously unreleased recordings made in 1971, prior to his Brandt-engineered makeover, <i>As the River Flows</i> presents an uncharacteristically intimate, unvarnished portrait of Jobriath finding his voice and persona, and shows how his considerable charm and magnetism—not to mention his killer piano skills—shine through with blinding radiance even in the absence of a major-label-bankrolled recording budget. </p>
<p>Though often labeled the “American Bowie,” Jobriath was actually more like Elton John, had the latter’s lyrical concerns been as outrageous as his <a href=""http://blu.stb.s-msn.com/i/4A/B3D0A12360A7D8D58B9C489641AE2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">outfits</a>. The elements at play on <i>As the River Flows</i>—a mix of showtune sass, gospelized soul, and Aquarian-age hippy-dippy jam-rock—were hardly subversive for their time, and much of this album would sidle up snugly alongside Elton’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi0xN499IXE&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Take Me to the Pilot</a>” on your mom’s favorite golden-oldies station. But then, Jobriath was the sort of singer who could raise eyebrows just by showing up and talking about his day. In contrast to, say, the sci-fi-inspired narratives of <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>, Jobriath sings frankly and non-chalantly about his routine habits—the pill-popping, the cross-dressing, the cock-sucking—with larger-than-life panache. And that charisma becomes all the more outsized when the recordings are stripped down to just voice and piano: the ivory-tickled “Wildfire in Memphis” is a male-hustler travelogue analogous to Lou Reed’s drug-copping odysseys on “Waiting for the Man”, with Jobriath gamely rendering transactional sex as sport: “I know the name of every pick-up bar in town… <i>do you</i>?” Even more captivating is the early attempt at “I’m a Man”, which would eventually get gussied-up for Jobriath’s 1973 self-titled Elektra release, but is presented here as a dying-embered torch song, its gender-bending sentiments (“I’m a man, yeah, I’m an elegant man/ satin bows and open toes are what I am”) delivered with an unflinching toughness that fleshes out the skeletal arrangement with full-blooded fervor. </p>
<p>The appearance of “I’m a Man” here alongside fellow Elektra-era holdover “Inside” inevitably casts <i>As the River Flows</i> as a rough sketch for the more ostentatious music to come, while freewheeling—and ultimately directionless—full-band guitar workouts like “Amazing Dope Tales” and “Ducky Lullaby” betray how much Jobriath benefited from Brandt and future producer Eddie Kramer’s direction and discipline. (Though one has to wonder if Jobriath’s fortunes could’ve turned out differently had the perfect-on-arrival space-bound lullaby “Little Dreamer” been re-recorded for his debut.) But on its own modest terms, <i>As the River Flows</i> feels less like a proto-glam-rock artifact and more like an urbane companion piece to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19088-lavender-country-lavender-country/"">the recently reissued 1973 debut album from Lavender Country</a>, another record that cast the often-unforgiving gay experience of the time in a whimsical light, coaxing humour out of hopelessness. Just as Patrick Haggerty built himself a homo-honky-tonk utopia <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFItJ3etWD8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on his band’s namesake theme song</a>, Jobriath valiantly valorizes the hard-knock life on <i>As the River Flows'</i> graceful power-ballad standout “City Freak”—the sort of defiant outsider anthem that suggests Jobriath didn’t necessarily need to see his face plastered on Broadway skyscrapers to feel like he was on top of the world. </p></div>"|19489.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19489-jobriath-as-the-river-flows/|7.5|Stuart Berman

The band was formed back in 2002, and after more than a decade of dues-paying and hell-raising, they've finally started attracting attention for their savage extreme metal hybrid. 2011 saw their inclusion on Southern Lord’s well-received <i>Power of the Riff</i> compilation, and two full-lengths later, Dais came calling to secure the rights for the trio’s fourth LP. The venerable experimental/noise label and the regressive-minded metal band seem like an odd coupling, but both parties seem chuffed with the arrangement and the result of their pairing speaks for itself. <i>Into Unknown Depths</i> is a delightfully dynamic approach to extreme metal’s usual grim-faced presentation. No two songs sound alike, but each one sounds deadly. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> Harassor have been around the block and peeked behind the curtain, but remain sworn to the dark. Despite the band’s intentionally lo-fi, almost primitive take on its chosen genre, the band personnel is about as far from the basement-dwelling black metal stereotype as one can get. Between the three of them, this gang cuts their time between several other projects (Lord Time, Lord Foul, Moonknight), oversee operations at famed vinyl mecca Amoeba Records, and peddle poison with the their own Rising Beast and Universal Consciousness labels. Their sound is tough and unwelcoming, based heavily in black metal, death/doom, and thrash’s salad days. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Harassor’s habit of cherry-picking riffs and patterns from all three genres makes for compelling listening, as does the sheer amount of technical know-how deployed on these pitch-black compositions. With the caustic Pete Majors on the mic and the intimidatingly powerful Sandor GF holding down behind the kit, </span><span>James “Roach” Brown III has the ideal settings to show off plenty of </span><span>light-fingered fretwork while wrangling the wild array of riffs he’s conjured. Despite the lack of bass, the guitar tone on <i>Into Unknown Depths</i> is a force to be reckoned with, thanks to a particularly clever set up and some help from a famous friend: Brown tunes his E string down to A, running the whole unholy racket through a mammoth Peavey tube amp and one of doom legend Wino’s very own cabinets. That rumbling range comes in handy on lumbering death/doom cuts like the churning mid-tempo opener “Nine of Swords” or the perverse Incantation-biting riff that drives the ultra heavy “Unknown Depths”. “Increased Decay” lives up to its name by starting off with a straightforward black metal maneuver and unexpectedly breaking down into an elephantine doom riff at the halfway point. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Harassor are adept at slow-burning death/doom (and the opening chords on “Devoured by Time” make for an inadvertent throwback to <i>Sound of Perseverance</i>-era Death), but they’re great at thrashy, punked-up black metal. They take a more traditional route with the grim, tremolo-fueled tension and flickering double bass of “Frozen Soil” and foggy, depressive Finnish bent of “Winter’s Triumph”, but are at their best when they inject a little rock’n’roll into the proceedings. The choppy punk beat, hyper-aggressive vintage Darkthrone feel, and snarled opening of “Die Forever” and swaggering black’n’roll stomp of “M.D.P.” make for album highlights alongside “Strangulated”, which sees Pete Majors’ acidic vocals take the wheel for a quick and punk-infected two minute hate. The gloriously filthy blackened punk of “The Harassor” makes for a brilliantly self-aware anthem to carry the album through to its bitter end via raucous parting shot “Purest Hate.” It’s a satisfying conclusion to an uncommonly good album; with <i>Into Unknown Depths</i>, Harassor have wrought the first bloody signs of Armageddon upon the City of Angels.</span></p></div>"|19486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19486-harassor-into-unknown-depths/|7.4|Kim Kelly

His most recent Soundcloud mixtapes, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/howtodresswell/no-words-to-say-songs-for-what-is-this-heart"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>No Words to Say </i></a>and <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/htdwtk/i-think-life-might-be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>I Think Life Might Be Elsewhere (Hungover Mix), </i></a>were heavy on what we’ve come to expect from him—along with his own work in progress, we’d hear a very specific set of influences, mostly R&amp;B and hip-hop, high/lowbrow dichotomies accepted by indie culture such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed"">Lou Reed</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5996-miley-cyrus"">Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug"">Young Thug</a>, and GG Allin. But late last year, early 2000s emo acts like the Starting Line, Taking Back Sunday and Saves the Day started to infiltrate, and surely he was trying to tell us <i>why</i> these bands speak to him. Whether it’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef"">Chief Keef</a> or Chris Conley, Krell is informed by genre but driven by expression; in his mind, pop music is anything that aspires for the most immediate and impactful connection, even if it risks embarrassment in the process. As a result, his transcendent third LP ""<i>What</i><i> Is This Heart?""</i> is a pop album of the highest caliber.</p>
<p>It’s easy to be skeptical, as he once treated mainstream music like an academic—pop rendered as ambient and insular experiences. His 2010 debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14678-love-remains/"">Love Remains</a> </i>didn't sound like anything else and still doesn’t, as if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski/"">William Basinski</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17064-the-disintegration-loops/"">The</a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17064-the-disintegration-loops/""> <i>Disintegration Loops</i></a> were filled with cuts from early '90s R&amp;B. Its follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17046-total-loss/""><i>Total Loss</i></a> was sleek and solemn salon-soul, interpolating Ashanti but still modeled by outré, experimental artists ranging from Proem to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28042-forest-swords"">Forest Swords</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a>. The dubious term “indie R&amp;B” already projected a degree of otherness on a white man in a primary black genre, and Krell’s egghead influences and agamous lyrics gave his detractors plenty of additional dirt.</p>
<p>But even in 2010, it should’ve been fairly obvious that grad students and grade schoolers alike can dream of being <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson"">Michael Jackson</a>, Bobby Brown or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a><i>.</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/how-to-dress-well/"">Krell told us recently</a>, “I want my music to be pop, but not populist—I want to be #1 on <i>Billboard</i>, but I want to do it on my own terms.” Previously, that might’ve smacked of indie defeatism, of wanting to be admired for sticking to his guns by contrasting it against an impossible scenario.<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> But in 2014, unique and truly weird polyglot R&amp;B/pop records like </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beyoncé</i></a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16859-channel-orange"" target=""_blank"">Channel Orange</a></i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17125-kaleidoscope-dream"" target=""_blank"">Kaleidoscope Dream</a> </i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">have achieved runaway commercial, critical, and artistic success.</span> It’s completely within Krell’s rights to ask, “why not me?”</p>
<p>So, here, Krell lets the music catch up with his extroverted candor, combining emotional risk and artistic confidence to figure out just how far How to Dress Well can go while retaining the project's essence. In retrospect, Krell’s albums sound as tentative and sketchbook as his mixtapes, as nearly everything on <i>“What Is This Heart?”</i> is a bolder, more accomplished version of what came before. ""2 Years On (Shame Dream)” reiterates Krell's taste for unseemly reverie, as a car ride with his family turns both surreal and hyperreal, its ache presented in startling clarity—Tracy Chapman may have been on his mind as a starting point for bare, acoustic folk, but he needed to cover the uber-emo <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwW0q65VIas&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“At Your Funeral”</a> over a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18357-crash-of-rhinos-knots/"">Crash of Rhinos</a> instrumental on his <i>Hungover Mix </i>to realize he was capable of doing it. “What You Wanted” pressurizes the subdued militance and tension of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13905-cold-nites/"">“Cold Nites”</a> and releases it in the monstrous, pitch-shifted vocals that deface<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16956-face-again/""> “Face Again”</a>. The orchestral ambitions of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15676-just-once-ep/""><i>Just Once </i>EP</a> and the redlining distortion of <i>Love Remains</i> are removed from their headphone-intended origins and given concert hall ambience on “Pour Cyril"".</p>
<p>The stylistic range of <i>“What Is This Heart?”</i> lends credence to Krell’s “pop, but not populist” ambitions—if he was to make a superproducer-per-song, blockbuster album, this is how it would likely turn out. However, Rodaidh McDonald returns to produce and retains the stained glass sound of <i>Total Loss</i>: bright, translucent, and nowhere near as brittle as it may first appear. More importantly, Krell’s voice is made the focal point rather than a texture. His singing can be parodied at this point, meaning that it's something established as clearly his own: demonstrative and inclusive as good karaoke, not performative in a way that’s meant to be judged. It’s spiritual, though more borne of a monastic purity than a specific religion. And now, it’s only distorted as a signature punctuation rather than using the effect as a white-out slather.</p>
<p>Krell makes it known that he's got <i>chops, </i>the kind that can handle the physical challenges of <i>“What Is This Heart?”</i>’s pop rites of passage—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16740-how-to-dress-well-words-i-dont-remember/"">“Words I Don’t Remember”</a> aspires for the “Purple Rain” extended coda, Krell’s wavering, breathless coo reverbed and distended to emulate an emotive, showstopping guitar solo. L.A. Reid should’ve desperately tried to smuggle the effervescent disco-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16829-repeat-pleasure/"">“Repeat Pleasure”</a> onto <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19333-michael-jackson-xscape""><i>Xscape</i></a> and if there was every a doubt that a HTDW song could be a legitimate smash hit rather than a deconstruction of one, there’s the arena-R&amp;B of “Precious Love”, which tags on a gorgeous, unexpected key change that lasts about ten seconds just to stunt.</p>
<p>In the true spirit of How to Dress Well,<i> “What Is This Heart?”</i> is comprehensive and referential, littered with bits and pieces of the music that’s moved him over the years. “Words I Don’t Remember” teases its lyrical cold war with the milky chords of Diana Ross’ “Missing You”; <span>Beyoncé'</span>s declaratory “to the left” cadence from “Irreplaceable” is utilized to express Krell’s apposite desire “to relate, to relate” on ""Precious Love"". Meanwhile, the spirit of “Very Best Friend” is so plainspoken and eternal that it has to be some roller rink obscurity from his youth, the source of which Krell is keeping from us all.</p>
<p>For the duration of How to Dress Well’s existence, Krell’s obsessive devotion to pop music has served as a connection he can trust, as he lowers himself into the depths of unanswerable questions about spirituality and death. While that love remains, Krell’s breakthrough on <i>""What Is This Heart?""</i> is a staggering paradox: as long as he holds onto that tether, he’ll probably never get to the bottom.</p>
<p>While Krell is sometimes still that college freshman listening to Jimmy Eat World with a “Childhood Faith in Love”, he writes about love like the philosophy Ph.D. student that he is—much of this album recognizes a pop cultural paradigm where love is presented as a panacea, the single most important thing a person can acquire. But the problem is that it’s so often conveyed through consumer products that love becomes one itself—something meant to be obtained, consumed, and replaced, a simple prop to occupy one’s time.</p>
<p>Krell recognizes his own complicitly in this situation both as a human and as someone who makes pop songs in How to Dress Well. The first words of “Words I Don’t Remember” are, distressingly, “You know that I love you, baby”, and he confesses with palpable guilt, ""Said 'it was you' for the rest of our lives"", referring to the joyous centerpiece of <i>Total Loss</i>.  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14177-it-was-u/"">“&amp; It Was U” </a>was indicative of how the brief flickers of happiness on past HTDW albums only served to remind you of the surrounding, oppressive presence of death and depression. Though <i>""What Is This Heart?""</i> is by far Krell’s lightest, most melodic album, his lyrics are constantly prodding at a pervasive societal problem: a mistrust of intimacy, fear of legitimate connection, the idea of romance as a competitive sport.</p>
<p>But if you think this is some kind of grad-level treatise, remember that the title of this album is phrased as a question. Krell’s pain and pleasure is borne of <i>in situ</i> struggle—do you say just what you want and when you want it in pursuit of an honest relationship, knowing that your most honest moments can be wicked? That’s the cruel irony at the center of “Repeat Pleasure”, where the title doesn't instantly reveal its cynical view of sex. What initially sounds like a glittery valentine becomes a ""Dear John""-in-waiting, as Krell realizes our tendencies to get caught up in routine:""I say there's no one above you/ But now there's a new place above that line.…Even if you're holding on for something unchanging/ And once you got it you'll want something else."" “What You Wanted” similarly provokes people who see others' hot love and emotion fade rather than continuing endlessly and assume that the same won't happen to them: ""Said I know that I want it/ Know that as soon as I've got it/ It'll change, I'll hate it.""  Later, on ""A Power"", Krell seeks sympathy and serenity rather than carnality; during a tribal, percussive breakdown and his most intense vocal performance, he sings with desperate joy, that if he doesn't share his desire to ""loved and lost in all directions"", he'll be sucked into, ""dark, silence and the void"".</p>
<p>Similar to Ezra Koenig, Krell can be the smartest guy in the room by having the best questions and the least amount of answers, and <i>""What is This Heart?""</i> does share important commonalities with the intellectually sound spiritual awakening of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17963-vampire-weekend-modern-vampires-of-the-city"">Modern Vampires of the City</a>—</i>their creators have always met their dull accusations of appropriation head on, and on their resepective third albums, they make them a moot point by completely upstaging the iffy subgenre they’re largely responsible for.<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> Yes, “indie R&amp;B” was always a condescending genre tag for unclassifiable music,</span> but it did help focus attention on the increasing interaction between big-budget pop and the sort of recording tactics that almost always resulted in would-be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices"">Guided By Voices</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink"">Ariel Pinks</a>. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Krell asserts that </span><i>Love Remains</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> does deserve credit for changing the trajectory of indie music in the new decade, still noting that, “while everyone was praising the underground and the overground coming together, somehow that turned into there not being any underground music.""</span></p>
<p>And he’s right: “indie R&amp;B” ended up being just as stylized, hyped and victim to fashion as the big league stuff. This hasn’t been the direct cause of so many listeners rediscovering things like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Kil Moon</a> in 2014, but it sure isn’t a fucking coincidence. Nor are the major influences of “<i>What Is This Heart?</i>”, an album that shames most of its peers musically and reveals that what the game’s been missing is, y’know, heart. Know damn well, if you love this album, you will be mocked for it, and soon—because one of its singles crests on a falsetto cry of, “even broken my heart will go on!”, and because there’s a song called “Childhood Faith in Love (Everything Must Change, Everything Must Stay the Same)”.</p>
<p>And it’s because like any vaccine to a ubiquitous illness, <i>""What Is This Heart?""</i> makes you initially susceptible and vulnerable, and that’s risky when modern discourse seeks metaphorical blood, allowing people to disclose more than ever without actually revealing anything. So make no mistake, the title of this album is a challenge as well, as How to Dress Well’s modern masterpiece is conducted with the most eternal transparency—Krell asks “what is this heart” and lets you look right into his own.</p></div>"|19433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19433-how-to-dress-well-what-is-this-heart/|8.8|Ian Cohen

Its look and feel was reminiscent of an early hardcore 7"", and the music itself possessed a similar kind of fury. Their full-length debut, <i>Seek Warmer Climes</i>, features a more romantic, refined image of a man in white lounging in the dirt, announcing a shift in Lower's sound. (The photo was taken by Lower bassist Kristian Emdal, who plays in <span class=""st"">Vår</span> with Iceage's Elias Bender Rønnenfelt, and who also did the cover art for Iceage's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17623-iceage-youre-nothing/"" target=""_blank""><i>You're Nothing</i></a>.) They're still noisy, but this time around they're focusing more on the jagged, wordy music you could easily term as ""post-punk"".</p>
<p>The thing you'll notice first on <i>Seek</i> is the growth in Toubro's approach. He croons, and sighs, and doesn't shout as often. He possesses a writerly approach—the vocal lines often ramble and collide with the music as if he wants to cram in as many syllables as possible regardless of what the rest of the band is doing. His delivery smacks of the type of vocalists that gravitate towards new wave and death rock (and he somewhat resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1479-bryan-ferry"">Bryan Ferry</a> at times, too).</p>
<p>Lower aren't making pop songs, but the best songs here have hooks. The central motif and narrative of opener ""Another Life"" (""Strive for another life/ Open your arms/ Invite it inside/ I'll show you what it takes to stay balanced""), along with Toubro's upbeat clip, makes for a potent salvo; that energy continues onto the second track, ""Dart Persuasion"", which pairs rabid drumming with another nice central repetition that would fit well in a manifesto: ""For all the tragic scars of your past/ You pointed out/ With an eye pinned to your navel/ Should I be shocked to the core/ By your rigmarole/ Your snivelling narration.""</p>
<p>""Lost Weight, Perfect Skin"" possesses a plastic surgery metaphor that comes across as ponderous, but it possesses enough fire to match the sarcastic, cutting sentiments within: ""Lost weight, perfect skin/ Will bring the torment to an end/ Put the smile back on my lips."" The album's first single, ""Soft Option"", is another good example of Lower in the zone, bringing in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a>-like background vocals with serrated guitars.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <i>Seek</i> can drag in a way that this kind of music shouldn't. ""Unkempt, Uncaring"" echoes its title in its loose construction and doesn't leave much of impression; elsewhere, the grand cacophony of ""Bastard Tactics"" and ""Craver"" don't amount to much more than that clatter. That said, even in <i>Seek Warmer Climes</i>' less impactful tracks, there are glimmering moments, and it's a testement to Lower that it's hard to discount any of the songs in their entirety.</p>
<p>Befitting such a curious band, the best song on <i>Seek Warmer Climes</i> is the longest, and the one that features accompaniment by two cellos. The 7-minute ""Expanding Horizons (Dar es Salaam)"" is about Toubro traveling to Tanzani in 2009 to work at an orphanage and finding that the religiousness of the place conflicted with his own change-the-world idealism. He left, moved around Africa, was almost kidnapped in Dar Es Salaam, and so on. ""Expanding Horizons"" opens with him singing, ""Here I stand/ On foreign land/ Expanding horizons/ Though nothing seems to match my fantasies/ I'm living a dream"", and the song itself offers the spaciousness of travel. It's patient, open, and the build feels earned. When he repeats ""caress yourself"" a few dozen times toward the end, you want him to keep going with that brief, very effective phrase.</p>
<p>It may not be fair, but it feels necessary regardless to acknowledge that fellow Danish punks, and associates, Iceage have cast a large shadow that all young Danish punk bands are measured against. That group's 2011 debut <i>New Brigade</i> still feels like the perfect encapsulation of the scene's overall aesthetic, and Lower strike me as the <i>other</i> Danish group from that scene who have it in them to reach those heights. Toubro has said that ""every song on [<i>Seek Warmer Climes</i>] deals in some way with personal development, be it emotional or cosmetic. How to act in different social contexts, and to acclimatize oneself into a given situation without losing face."" With that in mind, the occasional sense of compositional confusion makes sense: even if it doesn't always result in a thrilling listen, <i>Seek Warmer Climes</i> captures a promising band in transition.</p></div>"|19301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19301-lower-seek-warmer-climes/|6.9|Brandon Stosuy

Thanks to the productions from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22186-daniel-wang/"">Daniel Wang</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2748-metro-area/"">Metro Area</a>, a new wave of indie rock acts and DJs began to embrace the tropes of the genre. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/916-chk-chk-chk/"">!!!</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3184-out-hud/"">Out Hud</a> used those rubbery basslines and tireless drums for their own productions, as did folks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2619-lindstrom/"">Lindstrøm</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/"">Prins Thomas</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"">Todd Terje</a>. But despite this renaissance for the hedonistic, dance-til-10 a.m. pleasures of the form, a crucial aspect was being whitewashed out of this nu-disco revival: its inherent queerness. Some nights out felt like the clubs depicted in Whit Stillman’s <i>The Last Days of Disco</i>: straight, white, and well-lit, with very little dancing involved.</p>
<p>Enter the four hirsute bears behind Horse Meat Disco: James Hillard, Jim Stanton, Severino, and Luke Howard, whose logo featured a five-legged horse and who have hosted a Sunday residency in south London once dubbed “the queer party for everyone.” That party has since expanded into residencies in other countries and there have been four compilations that have followed. The first, released in 2009, was a delirious mix of astral, flute-trilled beatitude from the likes of <a href=""http://youtu.be/VW-h2CnGC2g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Karen Young’s “Deetour”</a> and <a href=""http://youtu.be/XMBUy5VoLfg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Smokey Robinson track that got aired at Paradise Garage</a>. Throughout the series, there’s been an emphasis on histrionic divas at their shrillest registers, polyester-bright synths, and symphonic strings so gaudy that Liberace might blush. More importantly, HMD helped move the disco appreciation away from rockists and back towards its guiltiest of pleasures.</p>
<p>There’s little left for the DJ crew to prove with the fourth installment of their mix compilations for Strut, but that doesn’t mean that <i>IV</i> fails to please. If anything, it clarifies that when it comes to crafting dance mixes, Horse Meat Disco find a way to stretch out, queue up the campiest of disco cuts from their shelves and wring the most aural pleasure out of them, whether they’re from the dollar bin or <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Winners-Get-Ready-For-The-Future/release/1599255"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in the triple digits</a>.</p>
<p>“Get yo hands off of my man!” a woman shrieks at the start of <i>IV</i>, and a steady tamborine rattle lead into Opal’s early '80s cut, “Ain’t No Way,” featuring two women fighting over their man. Cheesy, sure, but then the track suddenly reduces to an electronic trickle as a catfight breaks out and a bottle breaks, landing somewhere between boogie and acid house. A macho chant of “Misaluba” with an Italo backdrop rises next.</p>
<p>In HMD's brawny hands, past and present slide together, but the DJs aren’t afraid to take detours and have the mix drop from a boil to simmer. Joey Negro’s Sunburst Band's tough yet funky “Taste the Groove” hails from 2013, complete with a sweet talkbox breakdown that takes its time gearing back up. Sometimes the segues are thematic rather than matched: when Valery Allington purrs “Stop”, she is answered by Ish’s “Don’t Stop”, and while that classic cosmic disco track (which sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> at his most delectably prissy) has been comped a few times of late, it still thrills. The octave-jumping synth line that keeps scaling higher and higher is near delirium on a dancefloor, and it makes sense as the mix segues into another rare TK Disco track, King Sporty &amp; the Root Rockers’ “Get on Down,” a tribal boogie take on <a href=""http://youtu.be/rP0gegTUnBk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the better-known Connie Case version of the same</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite stretch on this mix is when Gwen Guthrie’s sampled voice coos “I’m in love with you” on Phreek Plus One’s “La Spirale”. Her voice—originally heard on the <i>Padlock</i> EP (mixed by Larry Levan and a staple of the Paradise Garage in the mid-'80s)—now appears as a 2012 nu-disco track by an Italian trio. Remixed by former !!!/Out Hud bassist/sound alchemist-turned-producer Justin Vandervolgen, it features eddies of echo and tingling windchimes, all of which leads into a dubbed-out horn line that seems to blare from ""The Love Boat""’s white leather lounge. More recent delights follow from new artists like Chicago’s Shahid Mustaf MC and last year’s single from (deep breath) J. Boogie’s Dubtronic Science featuring the Pimps of Joytime. There are various iterations of “Love” that rise and fall in this mix, as well as a chorus that you can still hear at the Loft: <a href=""http://youtu.be/D1898PitULc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Get ready for the future.”</a> Past or present, straight or gay, Horse Meat Disco makes sure that love is always the message.</p></div>"|19469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19469-horse-meat-disco-volume-iv/|7.7|Andy Beta

Culled from a pot of previously unused tracks Melchior has recorded over the past few years since adopting the Das Menace moniker, the record erratically pins down his singular vision of art-damaged garage-rock. It’s a wormhole he’s been wandering down with increasing crookedness since his start in the 1990s as a more straightforward protégé of Billy Childish, but on <i>Hunger</i>, Melchior’s fractured, punk-and/or-folk attack both helps and hinders his cause.</p>
<p>Melchior hasn’t hidden his adoration of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6554-mark-e-smith/"">Mark E. Smith</a> lately, and a similar Dadaist scowl informs “A Wizard Doesn’t Need a Computer” and “Robotic Footprints”. The former stabs at a synthesizer until it emits a klaxon whine; the latter runs a beatbox through what might be Melchior’s own innards. Fragments of poetic nonsense are ground into chants. They’re fun, but Das Menace isn’t able to summon enough of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">the Fall</a>’s seething loathing of logic to push them over the edge.</p>
<p>On the other end of the outsider spectrum, “Birdz” and “Parakeet”—the unifying theme can’t be accidental—find Melchior putting on his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/298-syd-barrett/"">Syd Barrett</a> outfit, stumbling through drifting zones of folk-saturated psychedelia and fields of diseased paisley. Melchior’s acid-troubadour inclinations are more convincingly heartfeltl; as a man who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4202-down-in-a-mirror-a-second-tribute-to-jandek/"">covered Jandek</a> in the recent past, he takes one more step in that direction on <i>Hunger </i>by delivering a beautiful rendition of Kevin Ayers’ “Town Feeling”, beefing up <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk5e6GtKvjI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the original</a>’s imagistic haze with a “Be My Baby” beat and snarls of invasive guitar. It nests neatly in the territory between Melchior’s lust for ogre-like rock and his love of the elfin loner.</p>
<p>Garage rock rears its homely head on just a handful of <i>Hunger</i>’s songs, and it’s a welcome break from the disc’s less focused experiments. Like a cave painting converted into sound, “Rip It To Pieces” harks back to Melchior’s Childish-influenced roots with his prior band the Broke Revue, hurls boulder-sized riffs and blown-out fuzz backward toward the Stone Age. “Gonna rip it to pieces/ Gonna drop it in feces/ You’re an endangered species/ ’Til my anger decreases”, he howls as his voice and guitar bleed together into a gritty, joyous paste of hate. That punk catharsis finds a cleaner, catchier vessel in the form of the album’s title track, the closest <i>Hunger </i>comes to a pop moment. But on this record, <i></i>Melchior proves skittish; every time the surroundings start to feel approachable, Melchior trawls a proto-metal groove, as he does on “Dungeon Blues”, or lapses into a murky, spoken-word trance, which renders the hooks of “Spooky Eyes” pretty much moot.</p>
<p>There’s another reason behind <i>Hunger</i>’s gnarled chaos: Melchior didn’t pick the songs. John Dwyer of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a>—a kindred spirit if Melchior ever had one—is the album’s curator as well as its patron, since it's being released on Dwyer’s Castle Face imprint. Dwyer’s ear for off-kilter garage-rock is impeccable, but here he deals from a mixed deck. The tracks only barely hinge together with none of the hushed cohesion of Melchior’s last full-length, 2012’s <i><a href=""http://northernspyrecords.com/music/the-backward-path/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Backward Path</a></i>. Granted, a specific mood, if not a concept per se, was guiding that earlier record.</p>
<p>Melchior’s wife, Letha Melchior Rodman—a guitarist of the unjustly overlooked '90s indie-rock outfit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ghqpfRWvnA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ruby Falls</a> as well the occasional bassist in Melchior’s band—has been battling cancer since 2010, and <i>The Backward Path </i>was suffused with the couple’s quiet, intimate struggle. In a way, <i>Hunger</i> is also colored by that situation; it’s partly an effort to <a href=""http://melchiorfund.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">raise funds</a> for Melchior Rodman’s medical treatment. The songs themselves don’t dwell on or directly address that, though—which helps make <i>Hunger </i>feel fiercely if unevenly urgent, in more ways than one.</p></div>"|19436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19436-dan-melchior-und-das-menace-hunger/|6.9|Jason Heller

Instead, the Metallic Falcons project went dormant, their lone album a fascinating one-off artifact. A captivating and inscrutable combination of shoegaze textures, obscure art-rock flourishes, and Southwestern desert ambiance, <i>Desert Doughnuts</i> was the type of album that seemed specially tailored to one day become a cult favorite. (Fittingly, Fred Armisen recently included <i>Desert Doughnuts</i> on <a href=""http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20796305,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a list of criminally underrated music</a>.)</p>
<p>In the interim, Matteah Baim has since released two atmospheric solo albums, each with a different group of backing musicians, neither of which sounded much like <i>Desert Doughnuts</i> or even much specifically like each other. <i>Falling Theater</i>, her third solo album and first since 2009’s <i>Laughing Boy, </i>doesn’t really evoke the Metallic Falcons’ soundscape either, but it does find Baim in full command of her emerging skills as a songwriter and performer. Featuring a top-notch group of collaborators, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11745-antony-hegarty/"">Antony Hegarty</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"">MGMT</a>’s James Richardson, <i>Falling Theater</i> is Baim’s most full-bodied and cohesive solo work to date, and perhaps the first in her catalog that might someday rival <i>Desert Doughnuts</i> in its cult appeal.</p>
<p>Baim’s most crucial collaborator on <i>Falling Theater</i> is veteran arranger/composer Maxim Moston, who has previously worked with such artists as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/"">Antony and the Johnsons</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4542-rufus-wainwright/"">Rufus Wainwright</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski"">William Basinski</a>. Moston’s arrangements here bring a sumptuous depth of field to Baim’s gentle songs, calling to mind the late Robert Kirby’s work with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3aZvWlRTDk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vashti Bunyan</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdKVt1g_EwA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shelagh McDonald</a>; his touch is an ideal match for Baim’s increasingly expressive vocals, and such tracks as the gorgeous “All Night” or “Blossom” are packed with subtle but unexpected instrumental shades and turns. Baim’s style as a songwriter is folk-like and direct, and though her songs typically lack oversized choruses her discreet melodies do find a way of grabbing hold.</p>
<p>In addition to her musical work, Baim is also a talented visual artist, and <i>Falling Theater</i> reportedly draws inspiration from the slow decay of America’s ornate pre-war movie theaters, as depicted on Lauren Dukoff’s album artwork and the work of photographer <a href=""http://afterthefinalcurtain.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matt Lambros</a>.  Although the album’s lyrics are generally too oblique to reflect this inspiration directly, there is a romantic sense of fading opulence in these songs, evoking quiet evenings spent in theaters baroque and lavish enough to have once been referred to as movie palaces. Nevertheless, Baim’s simple, haiku-like lyrics (“Peach tree in moonlight, can I stand like you tonight”) give little away, but tend to involve those moments in life where you turn your full attention to an otherwise overlooked detail.</p>
<p>One common thread that courses throughout Baim’s music has been her deliberate use of space and silence. The Metallic Falcons used open spaces in their music to conjure the vast nighttime desert, while Baim’s earlier solo works featured moments of silence that could sometimes translate as hesitation, as though the performers weren’t entirely sure where to follow the music next. On <i>Falling Theater</i>, Baim’s use of dynamic space feels much more balanced and strategic, as when the hushed “Familiar Way” briefly descends into a shimmering wordless drone that extends itself into circular chime of “Blindman’s Hands"". And on delicate pieces such as “Dude” or “Good For Two,” Baim’s duet with Antony Hegarty, she is able to achieve a sweet date-night intimacy before allowing the songs to dissipate into the night like spent neon from the marquee.</p>
<p>The deftness of her touch, coupled with Moston’s thoughtful arrangements, gives the album such a seamless quality that its individual tracks can sound almost jarring when isolated from one another. Fortunately, given its brief length (8 tracks in an EP-like 25 minutes) and considerable musical charms, <i>Falling Theater</i> is a listening experience that seems designed for easy repetition, ready to be queued up again before the house lights have a chance to come up. </p></div>"|19474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19474-matteah-baim-falling-theater/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

This probably had as much to do with your stance on <i>Shaking the Habitual </i>as your spot in the crowd, because<i> </i>from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10439-silent-shout-deluxe-edition/""><i>Silent Shout </i></a>on, the Knife have commanded a massive fanbase who have been waiting almost a decade to finally see them live. <i>Shaken-Up Versions</i>, an album of the remixes taken from the tour's setlist, makes a serviceable substitute for the live experience, and it's also a fine snapshot of where the Knife’s music is at right now: often challenging, at times a little frustrating, but at its core a thrilling body of work.</p>
<p>Like most live albums, the material captured on <i>Shaken-Up Versions</i> loses something when taken offstage, since choreography and charged atmosphere is lost in the transition from arena to wax. Fortunately, these remixes don’t need context. <i>Shaking the Habitual</i>, like the theoretical texts it cites, often seems like it’s been praised and referenced more than listened to in full, so it would have been easy for the Knife to aim for easy accessibility—but the reworks rarely smack of obviousness. On record, “Without You My Life Would Be Boring” possessed one of the stronger hooks on <i>Shaking the Habitual</i>—a quietly nagging synth line, percussion like rattling speakers, gonzo humor, and the rallying cry: “What if we can’t make it/ But we say that we can?”—but the Shaken-Up version takes things in a more challenging direction by puréeing the hooks and pushing the dissonant flutes and vox up front. Without a live crowd to prompt you, the remix is paradoxically easier to be studied than danced to, but it’s the Knife, so the polyrhythms and layers give you lots to work with.</p>
<p>The remixes collected on <i>Shaken-Up </i><i>Versions</i> aren't quite inaccessible, though. The rework of “We Share Our Mother’s Health” takes on a handclap-buoyed, infectious shuffle, with synths like airhorns, vocals pitched forward, and everything engineered to get butts out of seats. <i>Silent Shout</i>'s disturbing title track is transformed into a seven-minute breakdown that shudders with an even more anxious energy, Karin’s new vocal frayed and tentative in place of the original's gravitas. The two deepest cuts are the most excitingly recontextualized, both in terms of the Knife’s current sound and general outlook. “Got 2 Let U”, from 2003's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11891-the-knife-deep-cuts/""><i>Deep Cuts</i></a>, loses its strident oboe sample and gains a tempo injection—think 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13974-tomorrow-in-a-year/""><i>Tomorrow, in a Year </i></a>as UK garage—while lo-fi synth fairytale “Bird”, from the band’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11891-the-knife-deep-cuts/"">self-titled 2001 debut</a>, practically jitters here, with lines like “But you wanted me to be a girl/ Without feathers, without urge” taking on extra symbolic meaning when paired with <i>Shaking the Habitual</i>’s message.</p>
<p><i>Shaken-Up Versions </i>truncates the <i>Shaking the Habitual </i>setlist, so for those familiar with the stage show, the omissions are inevitable. and here they’re both obvious (Jess Arndt’s galvanizing spoken-word “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg13TKoYldo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Body Possum</a>” that appeared in the middle of the show), and puzzling (<i>Silent Shout </i>cut “One Hit”, a creepy track that would have nice company here). Yet, it’s a credit to the Knife’s craft that <i>Shaken-Up Versions</i> regardless feels like a complete statement; there’s a logic to the sequencing (<i>Silent Shout</i>’s singles bookend the album, while <i>Shaking the Habitual</i>’s statements of purpose make up the deeper cuts) and a throughline to the remixing choices that make it work on its own.</p>
<p><i>Shaken-Up Versions </i>doesn’t threaten replace anything in the Knife’s catalog, but it does highlight the levity that’s always been present in their music—yes, even on self-consciously, unsubtly Important Albums like <i>Shaking the Habitual</i>. The centerpiece of both that record and this new one is one line: “Ready to lose the privilege.” To do that, it helps to lose your inhibitions, and you just might need a good beat, too.</p></div>"|19465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19465-the-knife-shaken-up-versions/|7.3|Katherine St. Asaph

On <i>Why Do the Heathen Rage?</i>, his third album of propulsive electronica under the occasional name the Soft Pink Truth, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/980-matmos/"" target=""_blank"">Matmos</a> member taunts perhaps the most reactive, boundary-buttressing subgenre of them all: black metal, a historic domain of <a href=""http://www.metalinjection.net/lists/top-10-crimes-committed-black-metal-musicians/8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hate crimes</a>, <a href=""http://blackmetalmurders.edublogs.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">real blood</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_black_metal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ideological belligerence</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lty4o-LktNA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">institutionalized aggression</a>. Daniel—a gay electronic producer who moved from San Francisco to Baltimore in 2007—recruited a cast of indie rock pals and heavy metallurgists to cover 10 black metal songs, with relative standards from Mayhem, Darkthrone, and Sarcofago accompanying a sample of more obscure sides.</p>
<p>But guitars appear exactly one time here, blood-curdling tirades maybe three. Instead, Daniel and his collaborators turn these tirades about fucking and killing, desecrating and dying into dance-floor and pop-chart bait, with bludgeoning house tempos, mesmerizing hooks and prismatic synths. <i>Why Do the Heathen Rage?</i> is<i> </i>Daniel’s open invitation to name-calling, a plea to be branded with poser status and homosexual slurs from a scene that’s often been happy to oblige. It’s perhaps the ultimate black metal troll, an album meant to make the truest kvlt heathens, well, rage. The rest of us can simply move.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3860-the-soft-pink-truth/"" target=""_blank"">The Soft Pink Truth</a> began as a sort of dare for Daniel from the producer Matthew Herbert, who challenged the experimentalist to make a house record. Likewise, <i>Why Do the Heathen Rage?</i>, the project’s first output in a decade, began as Daniel’s dare for himself after DJing at <a href=""http://nymag.com/bestofny/fun/2013/gay-metal-night/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rainbow in the Dark</a>, a monthly “party for gay men, satanists and metal enthusiasts.” Could he pair one obsession with another? Could he take the misanthropic might of black metal and tie it to the communal ecstasy of techno? Could a song like Mayhem’s existentially doomed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izfaiG9_-2Y&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Buried by Time and Dust”</a> be rewired for the club? Absolutely.</p>
<p>In Matmos, Daniel has used electronic music to explore audacious concepts, whether that’s meant building a record from samples of surgical procedures to an album-length, detail-laced tribute to the duo’s heroes. <i>Why Do the Heathen Rage?</i> takes a similar tack, funneling far-flung resources into one intimidating concept. These risky reassessments come loaded with guests uniformly and uniquely suited to the challenge. In the prelude, for instance, Antony Hegarty trades lines of a poem about mysticism, androgyny and witchcraft with Daniel. The gossamer ease of the former sits like a specter against the pitch-shifted, Lucifer-deep growl of the latter. That juxtaposition sets the stage for a play between shades of pink and black, a tension that the album—the whole project, really—mines.</p>
<p>“Satanic Black Devotion” calls on both <a href=""http://www.ehserecords.com/ehse023/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">guitarist Owen Gaertner</a>, who toiled through transcriptions of all of these songs for Daniel, and Locrian’s Terrence Hannum, a nominal “metal guy” with a particularly broad view of what that might mean. In four minutes, the cover pinballs between Gaertner’s solemn electric guitar and Daniel’s drum machine punishment, Daniel’s ghoulish chants and Hannum’s pained screams. An <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BRv9wGf5pk&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I’ve Got the Power”</a> sample precedes an atmospheric fade into pastel noise. The trio finds its own path through the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyjeLjFaJrI&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">melodrama of the Sargeist original</a> but leaves room to point out that its self-serious malevolence is worthy of at least one laugh. Solo black metal dudes <i>always</i> have the power.</p>
<p>For similar reasons, Wye Oak’s Jenn Wasner emerges as the unexpected star of <i>Why Do the Heathen Rage?</i>. Along with Daniel himself, she serves as the paragon of respecting the source material while repurposing it at will, too. In its original form, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApW8dbcwFGg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Let There Be Ebola Frost”</a> is a rote, mid-tempo march from Finland’s short-lived AN. Its lunging riff and lacerated vocals mostly obscure the extreme essence at the song’s core, as though the band were too shy to confess to their own apocalyptic vision of a “realm of flushed blood.” But Wassner commands this script, delivering worldwide extermination orders without a hint of irony or innocence. “Feel it bleed so quick,” she coos in a moment of graceful comedown, Daniel emptying the beat into a bed of graceful synthesizer sighs. “I don’t feel any kind of compunction.” She summons a sort of schoolyard song at the end, turning a partial acrostic about annihilation into a cheerleading chant. Her turn on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Gbh3XThQk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sarcofago’s “Ready to Fuck”</a> turns the fellatio demands of a dude named Antichrist into a subversively demure seduction, full of starts and stops and squeals and background moans from both Wassner and a tamed demon played by Daniel. The take accomplishes what Sarcofago ultimately sought—that is, sex, or the suggestion of it—but reshapes the message by switching the sender.   </p>
<p>At such moments, it’s tempting to praise <i>Why Do the Heathen Rage?</i> as an expert, unapologetic sendup of black metal, a massive fuck you to a caste that’s said exactly that to so many others as a matter of stylistic necessity. The cover even depicts dudes in corpsepaint running trains on one another and skinheads getting handjobs from longhairs who wield knives and spike bracelets. And the record ends, too, with a wild-eyed and reckless race through<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5zrgO7fVkg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> “Grim and Frostbitten Gay Bar,”</a> a cut from the most obscure act included here—Impaled Northern Moonforest, the hyperbolic and hilarious black metal parody launched and dropped by members of Anal Cunt more than a decade ago. In spirit and sound, it’s the most allegiant cover here, a confirmation of a delirious mockery. The killer, one might surmise, <a href=""http://www.spin.com/reviews/soft-pink-truth-heathen/?utm_source=spintwitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=spintwitter"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has been killed</a>.</p>
<p>That’s too simple for black metal, though, and too simple for techno. Most of all, it’s too reductive for Daniel, an artist whose previous output doesn’t necessarily reflect his pedigree as a fan, a writer, a thinker and a person. (One doesn’t really <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/AN/17725"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stumble across AN </a>without a rather serious investment in this stuff.) “It’s about a contradiction or about a double citizenship that I have as somebody that’s a gay dude who’s heard a lot of dance music in gay bars and… loves a lot of sounds, a lot of imagery and a lot of ideas that are totally contemptuous of the ethos of dance floor music,” <a href=""http://www.steelforbrains.com/post/85545886662/drew-daniel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told <i>Steel for Brains</i></a>. He’s not out to destroy black metal so much as to reconsider the source of its unrepentant attitude and redirect it into another form with equal gusto. He’s strip-mined one thing he loves in order to drive another. In doing so, he’s found a wonderful, unexpected kind of combustion.</p>
<p>Yes, that will get him called names, and yes, that will make some faithful truly rage on message boards and (anonymously) in comment threads. But in 1982, above the belligerent stomp of “Black Metal,” Venom’s Cronos sang of “taking our chances with raw energy,” setting at least one cornerstone for the movement that followed. Daniel begins <i>Why Do the Heathen Rage?</i> with a trunk-rattling version of that anthem, launching his own take on black metal primacy by co-opting one of its founding documents. He swaps guitar solos for breakbeats and turns the chorus into an ecstatic, industrial chant. It’s meant to be shouted out with eyes closed and fists up—you know, real, metal power.</p></div>"|19454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19454-the-soft-pink-truth-why-do-the-heathen-rage/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

The more that once-uncommon voices are allowed to speak as themselves, the likelier it is that they'll slip their grievances and worries in under the cover of slyly built jokes.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30520-open-mike-eagle/"" target=""_blank"">Open Mike Eagle</a>'s solo career pushed him from Project Blowed cog to a spotlight that gave him space to ruminate over his fights against orthodoxy, starting with hip-hop's (his first two album titles: <i>Unapologetic Art Rap </i>and <i>Rappers Will Die of Natural Causes</i>) and working his way outwards from there. In the process, he's found a strong lane as an MC who cracks wise in both senses of the term. For each handful of fans that came to him through a connection with the Los Angeles underground hip-hop community, there's at least one who heard about him through stand-up stars like Hannibal Buress or Paul F. Tompkins.</p>
<p>So his latest album, <i>Dark</i><i> Comedy, </i>pipes in a laugh track on its semi-titular opening track, ""Dark Comedy Morning Show,"" and Mike Eagle makes sure it comes in clear after the more raw-nerved lines—""I flew off the handle, and boy are my arms tired""; ""If another dude calls me a racist, I'm'a snap""; ""There's mad shootings on the news/ Unless it's in the Chi, cause blacks and Mexicans can die"". The song sums up the whole album's ""on that laugh to keep from crying tip"" operating mode in just three verses, but there are new angles and transformative concepts that keep the balance unpredictably gallows-humored throughout.</p>
<p>""Informations"" sets up some <i>Tetsuo the Iron Man-</i>meets-<i>Videodrome </i>body horror that plays to smartphone-addiction fears, then leavens it with scatological humor (""When I pass gas it sounds like a fax machine"") and a sense that he's actually <i>thrilled</i> with the man-machine fusion. The line in ""Doug Stamper (Advice Raps)"" where he admonishes white rappers to ""Quit rappin' in your hood voice/ Sound like a clown 100-pounder that took 'roids"" both cuts closer and leans goofier when he actually imitates it as a dopey ""HARR RAAR RAAR RAAR RAAAGH"". Even when he threatens to lean towards unadulterated stress-rap, he undercuts it by titling his most severe bout of venting ""Sadface Penance Raps"" and cutting it off after less than a minute and a half under the pretext that the beat malfunctioned. The sung hook, lifted from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvOVMxOTwqw&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">They Might Be Giants' ""Don't Let's Start""</a>, that falls victim to this truncated ending: ""No one in the world ever gets what they want, and that is beautiful.""</p>
<p>Mike is an artist who thrives on working through some potentially inaccessible or confrontational thoughts and feelings using a very upfront and deceptively easygoing way with jokes and wordplay. That's not just in the references he throws around (""Thirsty Ego Raps"" gives not-entirely-non sequitur nods to Dave Gahan and Michel'le in consecutive lines), or his knack for internal rhymes and verse construction that actually scan like well-timed improv asides; it's also in how he builds up a self-portrait that establishes his own agency while still opening himself up to the possibilities of camaraderie and community.</p>

He pits party-rocking impulses alongside unglamorous but important fatherhood work by rhyming ""get up and dance"" with ""I wipe my son's ass and get shit on my hands,"" jabs at hood-pass-hungry vultures questioning his cred (""Fuck you if you're a white man that assumes I speak for black folks/ Fuck you if you're a white man who thinks I can't speak for black folks""), and builds a hook that upends ego-tripping with weasel words: ""we the best, mostly/ Sometimes the freshest rhymers/ We the tightest kinda/ Respect my qualifiers"". It's frank modesty in terms that any independent artist ever prone to self-second-guessing should recognize.</p>
<p>That nervous energy radiates through everyone in Mike's orbit, whether it's a characteristically mellow/jittery <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30151-kool-ad/"">Kool A.D.</a> feigning ignorance and riffing absurdist logic on ""Informations"" or Buress turning basic common courtesy into snarky older-brother wisdom on ""Doug Stamper (Advice Raps)"" with a Biz-caliber rap verse. (Sample line: ""Wash your hands when you touch your l'il dirty dick/ And dry 'em off before you come tryin' to shake my shit"".) Even the beats—Ultra Combo's <i>Cloud Rap for Airports</i>-esque ""Very Much Money (Ice King Dream)"", Dibia$e's chunky synths bouncily ambling in low-g on the dream gig with a catch story ""Jon Lovitz (Fantasy Booking Yarn)"", Jeremiah Jae laying down treated strings that sound like aluminum being table sawed on ""A History of Modern Dance""—hang on a precipice between whimsical irreverence and real to-the-gut emotional immediacy.</p>
<p>It all builds off a feeling that this anxiety touches everyone, that even if Mike's a singular kind of weirdo, his worries are our worries. So he's feeling out the process of coming to happy terms with the weirdness he and his friends inhabit, while still wishing it came with easy communication or self-sufficient success. Whether it's through casual observation or the to-the-bone identity struggles, Open Mike Eagle's overlap between amusing insights and uncomfortable truths makes for one of the most compelling indie-rap listens of the year so far.</p></div>"|19477.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19477-open-mike-eagle-dark-comedy/|8.0|Nate Patrin

Even with such undiminished output, however, <i>Band of Brothers</i> arrives with a great deal of expectations. It’s his first collection to feature predominantly newly penned songs in nearly 20 years. The last time he debuted so many compositions on one record, the result was 1996’s <i>Spirit</i>, which stands alongside the best in his long career. Which is saying a lot: As a Nashville songsmith in the 1950s and 1960s, he wrote such hits as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23523-patsy-cline/"">Patsy Cline</a>’s “Crazy”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5200-willie-nelson-merle-haggard-and-ray-price/"">Ray Price</a>’s “Funny How Time Slips Away”, and Faron Young’s “Hello Walls”. As a solo artist in the 1970s, he practically defined the outlaw movement with albums like <i>Shotgun Willie</i>,<i> Red-Headed Stranger</i>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12091-stardust-legacy-edition/"">Stardust</a></i>, and one of country’s best-selling albums, <i>Wanted! The Outlaws</i>, with Waylon Jennings, Tompall Glaser, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/973-jessi-colter/"">Jessi Colter</a>. So <i>Band of Brothers </i>has a lot to live up to.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Nelson isn’t writing from the point of view of an 80-year-old. There’s no grimness on <i>Band of Brothers</i>, no bleak admissions of mortality or putting-affairs-in-order solemnity that damned late-in-life albums by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"">Johnny Cash</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2341-kris-kristofferson/"">Kris Kristofferson</a>. Age ain’t nothin’ but a number to Nelson, who will likely be touring and toking long after we’re all dead. Even on “The Wall” and “Bring It On”, both of which reminisce about the hardships and regrets of a life spent on the bus, Nelson sounds triumphant rather than weary. “I hit the wall,” he sings, less like a beaten man and more like Joshua at Jericho: “And the wall came down.”</p>
<p>If he sounds like a man who just can’t wait to get on the road again, <i>Band of Brothers</i> suggests that he’s motivated less by wanderlust than by the camaraderie of his fellow scribes and musicians, many of whom have been with him since longer than you or I have been alive. This is nothing new for Nelson, who has been portraying the touring life as a mobile party since the early 1970s. His band on <i>Brothers</i> tears through these sad songs and waltzes with unfussy professionalism, nimbly navigating the wanted-man recklessness of “Wives and Girlfriends” and the spry Western Swing” of “Used to Her”. And Willie sings them like he can’t believe he gets to hear Mickey Raphael play harmonica every night.</p>
<p>The least satisfying songs on <i>Band of Brothers</i> address the music business itself and the changes Nelson has seen since earning his first credit more than half a century ago. His version of ""Hard to Be an Outlaw"", a new song by first-gen outlaw Billy Joe Shavers, takes contemporary tailgate country to task for oversell its barnyard bona fides: “The record people nowadays keep spinning ‘round and ‘round/ Songs about the backroads that they never have been down,” Nelson sings, chagrined that “they go and call it country, but that ain’t the way it sounds.” But he doesn’t do bitter very well, and both “Hard to Be an Outlaw” and Shaver’s other credit, “The Git Go”, sound dark, dirgelike, and out of place among so many uptempo numbers. (Shaver includes better versions of both songs on his upcoming album, <i>Long in the Tooth</i>.)</p>
<p>Nelson has always had an easy way with a wistful melody, and even though his voice has gained new grain over the years and lost some of its range, it’s more agile and commanding here than it has been on his last few albums. Still taking massive liberties with meter, he underscores the default optimism of closer “I’ve Got a Lot of Traveling to Do” and imbues “The Songwriters” with a sly wink. That light touch compensates for the convoluted concept of “Used to Her” and almost manages to sell the lines, “You’re like the measles, you’re like the whooping cough” on the otherwise fine “I Thought I Left You”. Nelson sings about romance like it’s still a vital concern for the eightysomething, which probably has less to do with his day-to-day life and more to do with his old-school approach to country songwriting. Even if it can’t measure up to <i>Spirit</i>, <i>Band of Brothers</i> is still a showcase for what Nelson does best. These songs pare the personal down to the universal, speaking eloquently to experiences common to every listener: love, friendship, hardship, trouble. </p></div>"|19468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19468-willie-nelson-band-of-brothers/|7.4|Stephen M.

That record blew the roof off what people thought “death metal” could be, and with it, Dead Congregation elevated the sound to nearly unsurpassable heights before stepping back to watch the next wave of “old school death metal” surge and strain towards the bar that they’d set. Now that the sound they helped reintroduce to the masses has reached critical mass and started to fall back out of favor, these godless Hellenics have returned to reap what they have sown—and show the rest of ‘em how it’s done. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><i>Promulgation of the Fall</i> is coming from a band entering into its tenth year of existence with an impeccable reputation and slavishly devoted fanbase, and they've spent the past six years fine-tuning the eight compositions on this release. That they’ve spent the better part of that decade engaging in fairly regular live performances shows in the writing, too, so songs sound tighter and the tension at work is impeccable. The four men leading Dead Congregation have always held themselves up to the highest standard of quality in this band, and this latest release is no different, showcasing the band at its most confident and powerful. Vocalist/guitarist A.V.’s imperious growl has never sounded stronger, the whole rhythm section locks together like clockwork, and the guitars are caked in gritty, graven tones that entice as much as they intimidate.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">After “Only Ashes Remain” comes roaring to life on the back of V.V.’s maniacally precise drumming and a thoroughly commanding central riff, title track “Promulgation of the Fall” ambles in with its prolonged intro and trundles along in saturnine fashion until the bottom drops out near the end and we’re treated to a satisfying taste of Dead Congregation’s loyalty to the low end. It’s an odd sequencing decision, as “Promulgation...” sounds like the clear choice for album opener, but it makes for one of the album’s nearly nonexistent missteps. “Serpentskin” starts off fast and furious, but its real power lies in the mid-song break, when it slows down to an unbearably slow, ponderous groove. It’s the kind of tricky maneuver that is incredibly easy to screw up, but Dead Congregation make it look like an afterthought. Most of their songs follow that same formula in different measures: some songs linger within that thick, sluggish tempo, while others revert back to blunt force in quicksilver blasts, but that same comfortable fast-slow-fast dynamic pervades the entirety of this dark, doomy death metal opus. It has worked for them in the past, and it surely works just fine now. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Unlike so many of their Greek brethren, Dead Congregation has never stood for innovation. Instead of pushing extreme metal's boundaries into strange new dimensions, A.V. and his cohorts have concentrated on perfecting a very specific sound that invokes a very specific atmosphere, drawing from a very specific sonic template in order to achieve that vision. That’s not to say that <i>Promulgation of the Fall</i> is boring or homogenous; on the contrary, it offers an embarrassment of riches for the death metal connoisseur, and plenty of surprises for the newly initiated. The guitar work on""Immaculate Poison"" is ripped straight from Slayer's earliest, most evil efforts, and when the screaming solo and rippling fretwork on “Nigredo” slices up and out through the quagmire of distortion or apocalyptic chords of album closer “From a Wretched Womb” come howling from the void, it’s clear that there is something special happening here. Most importantly, they leave us wanting more.</span></p></div>"|19457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19457-dead-congregation-promulgation-of-the-fall/|7.9|Kim Kelly

The Nottingham-based artist is a master of indulgence, jamming his tracks with jagged, aggressive rhythms and glistening melodies. Cutler draws heavily from rave music’s more explicitly colorful side, embracing the all-out intensity of breakbeat techno and hardcore’s effervescent steamroll; like many of his contemporaries, he was barely old enough to ride a bike when those strains of dance music emerged the first time around, so his work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29381-lone/"" target=""_blank"">Lone</a> is essentially a reconstruction, an alternate version of the past put together by someone who wasn’t around to experience the sound's genesis.</p>
<p>Cutler sidesteps claims of misplaced nostalgia through sheer inventiveness. After working in earnest near the end of the 2000s, he first caught a larger audience’s ear with 2010’s kaleidoscopic <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14998-emerald-fantasy-tracks/"">Emerald Fantasy Tracks</a></i>, released on his own Magic Wire imprint. An eight-track collection that felt less like a unified whole and more like a collection of singles, <i>Emerald Fantasy Tracks</i> gave a brighter tint to to the dazzling grit of techno luminaries like Underground Resistance. Resurrected European techno label R&amp;S took notice and signed Cutler, and two years later he released what stands as his magnum opus, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16578-galaxy-garden/""><i>Galaxy Garden</i></a>. It was a massive achievement and also startling in its originality. Upon its release, Cutler told <a href=""http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/interview-lone-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Stool Pigeon</i></a> that the record was “influenced by nothing,"" and although rave music loomed larger than ever in his sound, the comment made some sense. <i>Galaxy Garden</i> is one of those records that truly feels <i>boundless</i>, a head trip that practically overflowed with beatific melodies and inviting textures. (It’s unsurprising that, in the same year, Glasgow's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"">Rustie</a> tapped Cutler to contribute a new track to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16498-essential-mix/"">his era-defining contribution to BBC’s Essential Mix series</a>; maximalism is a central tenet to the Lone sound.)</p>
<p>One of the decade’s singular electronic records, <i>Galaxy Garden</i> was a thrilling document that made you wonder where Cutler would take his sound next. <i>Reality Testing </i>turns out to be both a left turn and a back-to-basics move. Largely abandoning rave’s warp-speed tempos and sensual overload, <i>Reality Testing</i> finds Cutler shifting his focus to the dusty hip-hop grooves of auteurs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">J Dilla</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a>, two artists regularly name-checked by European dance producers as formative influences. Cutler’s no exception: his early work drew from those artists’ loping knock as much as it did from the hazy electronic music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>, with 2009’s <i>Ecstasy &amp; Friends</i> (released on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"">Actress</a>’ continually ahead-of-the-curve Werk Discs imprint) being the last time he explored those sounds so thoroughly.</p>
<p>Depending on the your relationship Cutler’s earlier music, the shift in focus on <i>Reality Testing</i> can prove initially disappointing—there’s no shortage of producers currently attempting to hardwire hip-hop motifs to Boards of Canada’s iridescent glow, and he's covered some of this ground before. It might take a few listens to get on Cutler’s current wavelength, but approaching <i>Reality Testing</i> with an open mind yields great rewards. It’s one of his most assured and confident efforts and it provides a perfect gateway into the Lone sound.</p>
<p>I've heard comparisons between <i>Reality Testing</i>’s more explicitly hip-hop-influenced cuts and the work of Wolverhampton producer Stephen Wilkinson’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/576-bibio/"">Bibio</a> project. The two artists operate in different lanes—Wilkinson’s more predisposed to song-based structures, whereas Cutler derives his energy from dance’s lack of set definitions—but the similarities are there. “Restless City” is all tumbling claps and record-skipping sounds, with a few needle-drop effects to add a sense of halting texture; “2 Is 8” sounds deliciously retro, with vocal samples occasionally intruding on the track’s knocking drums and steam-pipe melody that resembles an alternate take on the “Sesame Street” theme. “Meeker Warm Energy” oozes West Coast lackadaisical vibes, with honeyed static slathering a Dilla-aping beat; early single “Airglow Fires” takes the hat-tipping a step further by calling back to the vocal sample from Dilla’s <i>Donuts</i> neck-whipper “The Twister (Huh, What)”, speeding up the easygoing tempo and covering the thing in chunky chords reminiscent of Detroit techno.</p>
<p>The sounds of early-gen Detroit dance music is <i>Reality Testing</i>’s other main influence; the hollow chords that anchor “Aurora Northern Quarter” bring to mind Derrick May, and “Vengeance Video” is the album’s most straightforward house cut, a patiently skipping tune that benefits from a loopy synth entering at the halfway point. Another of Cutler’s frequent touchstones, the clean sparkle of new age, is all over <i>Reality Testing. </i>Although the embrace of new age in dance music has become a common trend among young producers, few apply those textures as effectively as Cutler does. Wind chimes enter and exit—opener “First Born Seconds” is literally two minutes of swarming, spa-ready drone—while closer “Cutched Under” calls back to the downtempo glory of the Anneka-featuring <i>Galaxy Garden</i> capper “Spirals”, melding warm tones to the type of marching percussion that overtook Bristol’s bass sound circa 2010.</p>
<p>Cutler’s ear melody takes center stage on <i>Reality Testing</i>. His touch is distinctive and generous—the Lone remix of Radiohead’s <i>The King of Limbs</i> cut “Feral” wrung benevolence out of that album’s most abstract, slight track—and here his jams run free, from the delectable yo-yo synth line that crashes through the head-nod of “Meeker Warm Energy” to the sparkling pan pipes that whirl around the speedy house motifs of “Begin to Begin”. Similar to kindred spirit and Cologne producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28724-motor-city-drum-ensemble/"">Motor City Drum Ensemble</a>, Cutler proves most effective at applying personal dabs of melody to his own vision of the past.</p>
<p><i>Reality Testing</i> is Cutler’s easiest listen—you can imagine this music playing over coffee shop speakers as much as you could put a rapper on top of it—and as such it may seem less innovative when placed up against his previous two full-lengths. It’s more spare than the dense <i>Galaxy Garden</i>, but it’s also a few minutes longer than that album, and by comparison its relatively placid back half blurs together a little more than the acid-infused pyrotechnics of its predecessors's losing cuts. Regardless, <i>Reality Testing</i> stands as one of the year's best, most luxuriant, and accomplished electronic albums, more proof that when it comes to forging a new future out of what’s already taken place, Cutler remains at the top of his game.</p></div>"|19458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19458-lone-reality-testing/|8.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Less than a year later, he appeared on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O1_3zBUKM8&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Naughty Boy's ""La La La""</a>, a summer smash that went to number one in the UK and the top of the charts in the rest of Europe. By the time he released ""Money on My Mind"" at the beginning of 2014, it was already a done deal. The young 22-year-old, the son of a wealthy London banker who was fired for spending too much time trying to jumpstart his pop career, would be the UK's next big thing. And here we are: the week where his debut <i>In the Lonely Hour</i>, sees release in North America, the album is sitting at number one in the UK for the second week in a row, riding two chart-topping singles and edging the US top ten with its latest. </span></p>
<p><span>So why all the hubbub? If you've heard ""Latch"", you already know about <i>that</i> voice: Sam Smith possesses one hell of a set of pipes, able to go from a commanding lower register to an inhumanly high squawk in record time. (“I remember hearing ‘Latch’ and thinking, ‘No person can go through that many vocal ranges at one time without going through a computer,’ ” said one of his A&amp;R reps in a recent feature.) That talent is central to ""Money on My Mind"", an itchy-feet drum'n'bass number with a chorus so high-pitched you might mistake Smith for a bird. More importantly, however, he details his signing to the record label and his apparent unwillingness to kowtow to record label demands, attempting to set himself apart as a freethinker. ""I do it for the love,"" he insists on the chorus, and ""You say, 'Could you write a song for me?'/ I say, 'I'm sorry I won't do that happily'"" in the verse. But the main problem with <i>In the Lonely Hour</i>—and all of Smith's music up to this point—is exactly the opposite: it feels like the record company has groomed him within an inch of his life.</span><br/> <br/> <span>With undeniable pipes weighed down by generic songcraft, Smith makes me think of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26066-duffy/"">Duffy</a>, a blue-eyed soul singer recruited in the wake of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5185-amy-winehouse/"">Amy Winehouse</a> to capitalize on the sudden hunger for retro soul music. While Smith doesn't tap into that sound as directly, the emotional impact of the syrupy strings, by-the-book lyrics about heartbreak, and trite chord progressions is the same. </span></p>
<p><span><i>In the Lonely Hour </i>is meant to be Smith's love letter to a man who never returned his feelings; it's an affecting idea, and Smith's inexperience—he hasn't yet been in a relationship—should provide for a fascinating level of sincerity, but too often it feels like he's being held back by an oppressive sense of musical conservatism. ""Stay With Me"" (currently making its way up the U.S. charts) has all the elements of a stunning ballad, a plea for a lover to stay over after a one night stand just for some human contact. Unfortunately, a hammy choir over-emotes all over his delicate late-night vulnerability, taking Smith's raw honesty and overcooking it to a grey pallor.</span><br/> <br/> <span>There are other moments of lucidity that pop up amidst the midtempo mush. The tender ""Good Thing"" has Smith expertly navigating tangled lyrics about obsession (""Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore/ Watch where I tread before I fall"")—but then there's an inexplicable blast of cheesy Hollywood strings in lieu of a bridge. ""Leave Your Lover"", meanwhile, has a disarmingly direct chorus: ""Leave your lover/ Leave him for me,"" all sung matter-of-factly in his most gorgeous falsetto. He repeats the conceit on ""Like I Can"", this time a mess of clichés built on a trendy acoustic guitar stomp, a sound that's more representative of the rest of the album. ""Not in That Way"" is a histrionic weeper with all the subtlety of a Susan Boyle song, and the type of lyrics written by high-schoolers still stuck rhyming ""moon"", ""June"", and ""spoon"". </span><br/> <br/> <span>Still, most of <i>In the Lonely Hour </i>is enjoyable just for Smith's voice alone—so unusual, unpredictable and utterly pleasing that it can be wonderful to listen to even through the most egregious of lite-FM tropes. But so much of the album remains hard to swallow otherwise, lost underneath layers of industry polish and focus-grouped lyrics. Though there's no doubt <i>In the Lonely Hour </i>comes from a personal place, it doesn't end up feeling like a very personal record. Except for one part: on the album's very first line, Smith quivers ""When I signed my deal/ I felt pressure."" Judging from how <i>In the Lonely Hour </i>turned out, his suspicions were for good reason.</span></p></div>"|19450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19450-sam-smith-in-the-lonely-hour/|5.5|Andrew Ryce

The performers, who range from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30072-ymusic/"">yMusic</a> (with help from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7136-aaron-dessner/"">Aaron</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27735-bryce-dessner/"">Bryce</a> Dessner and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"">Nico Muhly</a>) to the venerable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6375-kronos-quartet/"">Kronos Quartet</a>, wear stethoscopes over their chests to keep time. Their pulse is also the piece's. In some cases, one performer's breath dictates the ensemble's movements; in others, the ensembles work together, playing in and out of sync with each other in heterogeneous clouds. </p>
<p>It's a remarkable concept, and it seems impossible that no composer has thought of it before. Composers have previously consulted the I Ching, rolled dice, tossed coins; Olivier Messiaen searched all the way back to 17th-century plainchant to free himself from the tyranny of the organized beat. How no one thought to look at their own chest, rising and falling, and make this primal connection, beggars belief. Parry himself seems incredulous: ""For awhile I thought, for goodness sake, has somebody really not done this?"" <a href=""http://sinfinimusic.com/uk/features/interviews/composer-interviews/richard-reed-parry-from-arcade-fire-on-his-album-music-for-heart-and-breath"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told Sinfini Music</a>. </p>
<p>The conceit animates the music, figuratively and literally. There is a palpable aliveness to the performance that makes the makes the six pieces, written for different configurations, feel like a guided meditation. This is body music, unquestionably, and by the end of the album the music's subtle internal rhythms have reconfigured your own.  </p>
<p>Parry's touch as a composer is pensive and delicate. There are a few startling outbursts here and there, but they recede gracefully, and the overall impression is of groups of notes judiciously dotting vast white space rather than swarming the canvas. The mood is still, serene, similar to Western mystics Lou Harrison and Terry Riley. In the ""Heart and Breath Sextet"", violins slide down some minor thirds, bent back like bamboo branches. Pianos push gently in the opposite direction with rising figures. It's the sound of sighs and chatter, a foyer filling up with arriving dinner guests—but just as soon, these voices back away into silence again. The effect is mournful, muted; if Parry's method is skewed toward the sounds of humanity, his ear leads him away again into silence and emptiness.</p>
<p>Each piece traces simple, profound gestures and then tapers away, leaving a troubling impression. Interruptions comprises seven miniatures, only one longer than four minutes: the   plucked strings, guitars, and gracefully staggered woodwinds of ""Sticks/Tension"" hit the ear like a handful of pebbles splashed into a pond. ""Duet for Heart and Breath"" pairs Parry with yMusic's violist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31183-nadia-sirota"">Nadia Sirota</a>, who draws breath audibly before bowing some feather-soft harmonics.  ""Freeform Winds/String Drones"" is just that, overlapping washes of sound that move in unpredictable surges.  </p>
<p>Parry's writing is shimmering, jewel-like. His firm grasp of mood and color recalls Messiaen's <i>Quartet for the End of Time</i>, but his music doesn't end time so much as atomize it and spread it out—things happen in <i>Music</i><i> for Heart and Breath </i>at roughly the same pace as they do in real life. There are no fixed points, just motion along a spectrum, and we never know exactly where we are. But the uncertainty, familiar as it is, is oddly soothing. </p></div>"|19446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19446-richard-reed-parry-music-for-heart-and-breath/|8.0|Jayson Greene

He’s best known as a film composer and music supervisor on<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=sofia+coppola""> Sofia Coppola</a>’s movies, while his work in bands—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"">Air</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3549-redd-kross/"">Redd Kross</a> among them—is something of a footnote in their respective biographies. When Reitzell talks about music, he often mentions similarly anonymous figures as inspiration, finding kinship in krautrock acts and Daniel Lopatin’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> project. Yet, he clearly commands a special kind of respect in the people he approaches to work with him. How else to explain his teasing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4045-kevin-shields/"">Kevin Shields</a> out of semi-retirement to work on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7714-lost-in-translation-with-various-artists/""><i>Lost in Translation</i></a> score, or getting reclusive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"">Talk Talk</a> frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1967-mark-hollis/"">Mark Hollis</a> to make his first music in an age, for (of all things) the Kelsey Grammer-starring TV show <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47680-talk-talks-mark-hollis-resurfaces-with-new-music-for-the-kelsey-grammer-tv-show-boss/"">""Boss""</a>? In his own quiet way, Reitzell’s a powerful figure who can exert influence in the most unlikely places.</p>
<p>For his debut solo album, the Los Angeles-based composer turned to a swathe of his influences as inspiration, while also bringing on board a select band of notable collaborators. Shields surfaces again, contributing organ, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25867-jim-james/"">Jim James</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2880-my-morning-jacket/"">My Morning Jacket</a> worked up seven-part harmonies for “Ozu Choral” that Reitzell subsequently manipulated for his own means. There are a bunch of fellow backroom musicians working alongside him here, too, including Mike Dillon, Dave Palmer, and Roger J. Manning Jr., making the whole enterprise resemble something like a cooler version of session-musician supergroup Toto. But <i>Auto Music</i> doesn’t sound like group music, instead touching on areas Reitzell has clearly obsessed over in his film work, including the spacey qualities of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/74-the-virgin-suicides/""><i>The Virgin Suicides</i></a> score (“Last Summer”) and the hazy shoegaze fug that permeated throughout <i>Lost in Translation</i> (“Ozu”, “Oskar”).</p>
<p>The nine wordless songs here don’t have much to link them thematically, although Reitzell sees them as soundtracks to long West Coast drives through vast, open plains. It’s a record that was recorded over a long period—begun over a decade ago, according to <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/brian-reitzell-exclusive-stream-auto-music-sofia-coppola/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this interview</a>—causing a lack of cohesion at times. Mostly, it’s an interesting curio from someone who clearly spends a great deal of time thinking about music but can’t quite reach beyond the sounds he hears to get into his own sphere. So “Gaudi” touches on the jazzy atmospherics of Talk Talk’s later works, while “Honeycomb” brings in the creaky, piston-like dynamics of certain <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a> songs; “Auto Music 2” resembles his play for a contemporary update of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>’s “Autobahn”. It’s enjoyable on a base level for anyone interested in those styles, even if there is a creeping feeling of musical dress-up being played.</p>
<p><i>Auto Music</i> provides insight into Reitzell’s thought process behind his film scores; listening to a song like “Ozu”, so clearly indebted to the rough-around-the-edges version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> that Shields was honing on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991/""><i>Isn’t Anything</i></a>, it makes sense that Reitzell would undertake the (at the time, seemingly impossible) task of persuading him to release music again. Ultimately, that’s not enough to make <i>Auto Music</i> shine in its own right, although there are moments that cut through the surface noise. As “Ozu” makes its descent out of MBV-land, it echoes around repeating slabs of guitar, verging on its own weight instead of borrowing someone else’s. Perhaps this is the inevitable end product of the music supervisor—someone who spends so long observing other work that they can’t get into their own space. There’s something poetic about that, a man’s own advances stalled by the very things he loves, and that struggle at least gives <i>Auto Music</i> a dose of tension at its heart.</p></div>"|19467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19467-brian-reitzell-auto-music/|6.5|Nick Neyland

Drummer and vocalist Tim Call runs the Parasitic label and has played in a slew of groups including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30403-aldebaran/"">Aldebaran</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5938-the-howling-wind"">the Howling Wind</a>, and Weregoat; guitarist/vocalist Todd Burdette plays in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22512-tragedy/"">Tragedy</a> and Severed Head of State, and was a former member of influential crust band His Hero Is Gone. <span style=""font-style: normal;"">Their debut, </span><i>The Living Ever Mourn</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, serves as a bridge between their own tastes and influences.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"">True to their origins, Nightfell alternate between resembling a slowed-down <b></b>version of Tragedy <i>or</i> a sped-up take on Aldebaran; they're also heavily influenced by Call's love of funeral doom, namely groups like Skepticism and Mournful Congregation (who Call has also played live with). Funeral doom is as depressing as it sounds; motion is halted in favor of creating a overwhelmingly glum atmosphere. <i>Mourn</i>'s two interludes—an oddly syrupy keyboard sequence and a track punctuated by acoustic guitars and drawling vocals—further underline the genre's presence. Still, traces of the melodic crust Burdette popularized with Tragedy and His Hero Is Gone are found in his guitar work for Nightfell, especially in his leads on “I Am Decay”.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"">“Altars to Wrath” is the most successful union of their personalities; Call delivers some D-beat in the middle of the track, while Burdette unleashes monstrous death metal riffs that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30949-asphyx/"">Asphyx</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29976-disma/"">Disma</a> would be envious of. Tragedy's last record, 2012's <i>Darker Days Ahead</i>, suffered from a lack of urgency; while <i>Mourn</i> is a slower-sounding record, the tempo change doesn't come across as labored because Call and Burdette's chemistry works, even with music as slow and morose as this.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"">Their partnership is especially engaging when Burdette lends some clean guitars to “The Hollowing”, producing soothing tones while Call wails away on the drums. It creates a fruitful tension, as there isn't much room to breathe throughout <i>Mourn. </i>When a pick-slide comes in and a crusty charge dominates the final seconds of the song, the intrusion doesn't feel jagged. Similarly, on “Dirge”, Burdette's clean playing fights with Call's militaristic snare. For less experienced players, such experiments could come across as clunky; for them, it sounds natural.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"">After getting a digital and cassette release earlier in the year, <i>The Living Ever Mourn </i>is seeing vinyl via Southern Lord, which makes sense. They started out as a doom-oriented label before getting into black metal, and more recently, the label has shifted towards putting out many crust-influenced hardcore records. With Call and Burdette's combined backgrounds, <i>Mourn</i> shrinks the disconnect in Southern Lord's roots and their present-day activities.</p></div>"|19106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19106-nightfell-the-living-ever-mourn/|7.5|Andy O'Connor

The project’s first full-band effort, 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13196-hospice""><i>Hospice</i></a>, followed two collections of roughshod solo material from lead vocalist Peter Silberman, records that sounded as if he were fumbling in the dark; <i>Hospice</i>, then, was light making its way into the room, a collection of indie rock that drew from the sounds you’re likely to find on an iPod owned by someone in their mid-20s—sparkling chamber-pop, angsty, emotive vocal surges, gaping shoegaze guitars. Two years later, they returned with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15411-burst-apart/""><i>Burst Apart</i></a>, a transitional effort that found the Antlers getting weirder, incorporating the kind of saucer-eyed ambience familiar to anyone who’s ever heard <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur Rós</a> in a smoke-filled dorm room.</p>
<p>If <i>Burst Apart</i> was the sound of the Antlers dipping their toes into unfamiliar waters, on the following year’s mini-LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16860-undersea/""><i>Undersea</i></a> they took the plunge: notions of immediacy and concision were discarded, replaced by a slow-handed approach to space rock that valued detail over the type of explicit melodicism showcased in their earlier work. In opposition to the music that was being put forth, the shift on <i>Undersea</i> was startling, bold, and more than a little brave. By industry standards, the Antlers were growing—<i>Undersea</i> was their first release for Anti-, a significant step up in visibility from their previous label, NYC-based farm-team indie Frenchkiss—but as the lights were increasingly trained on them, the band managed to find their own darkened corner in the musical landscape. <i>Hospice</i> could sound like the work of a band that was very good at sounding like other bands; <i>Undersea</i> was the point at which the Antlers found themselves. <i>Familiars</i>, the Antlers’ first full-length in three years, confirms that they are operating in their own zone. They’ve doubled down on <i>Undersea</i>’s somnambulant moodiness and increased focus on atmosphere, resulting in their longest, most subtle release.</p>
<p>As with every Antlers record since <i>Hospice</i>, <i>Familiars</i> was self-produced, and the group’s collective ear for texture continues to take hold as its own expressive instrument. As ever, drama is in no short supply either. Silberman’s lyrical predilections, in particular, have long possessed an emotional scope that speaks to the honest naiveté associated with stumbling through your young adulthood: <i>Hospice</i> essentially compared love and loss to a children’s cancer ward, <i>Burst Apart</i> was all house fires and metaphors for sexual frustration, and <i>Undersea</i> explored the age-old concept of water-as-emotional metaphor. In an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9425-the-antlers/"">interview</a> with Pitchfork, Silberman name-checked filmmaker Gaspar Nóe’s trippy opus <i>Enter the Void</i>, a movie that treats death as an orgasmic act of self-exploration, as one of a few inspirations for <i>Familiars</i>’ funeral-pyre slow-burn. “There are different ways to look at death,” he said, “and they don’t have to be depressing at all.”</p>
<p>In that same interview, Silberman claimed that the Antlers are frequently pegged as a “sad band,” and while no one will mistake the breathy ruminations of <i>Familiars</i> as “happy music,” the record’s instrumentation has a transcendent brightness, not unlike what you might see when closing your eyes after staring into the sun for too long. The spacious lope of “Intruders” is made up of muted guitar stabs and molasses-slow drum work, surrounded by heavy swirls of space and dotted with the occasional horn and keyboard flourish; “Surrender” rests itself on a gently descending guitar figure that, at the six-minute song’s midpoint, reaches upwards to impossible heights before dissolving in pedal-abused piano and horns soaked in warmth.</p>
<p>Whether they’re reaching above their heads or to the deepest depths, on <i>Familiars</i> the Antlers are even more concerned with catharsis, resulting in a string of patient, beatific crescendos. (The word “patient” is, at this stage of the Antlers’ career, operative: only two of <i>Familiars</i>’ 10 songs finish before reaching the five-minute mark.) The elegiac “Director” spends its first two minutes and change moving at the pace of a burning stick of incense, as Michael Lerner’s brushed cymbals create a suitable bed for drowsy guitar; then, the weight shifts in the form of rolling drums and <i>just enough</i> six-string fuzz, evoking the type of soft psychedelia that Spiritualized have occasionally turned to. Opener “Palace” is essentially five-and-a-half minutes of declarative melody that comes on strong and stays there before vanishing completely, while “Revisited” is the record’s torch song—but one without resolution, as Silberman repeatedly switches between anguished vocals and receding into the background, breaking into a elliptical guitar solo near the song’s end that floats above the fizzy electronics.</p>
<p>As a vocalist, Silberman’s never shied away from theatricality; on <i>Hospice</i>’s “Sylvia”, he seethed and cried to match that song’s bursting guitar burn of a chorus, and every successive release has seen him expanding his register to match the music’s at-times skyscraping qualities. On <i>Familiars</i>, Silberman cements himself as one of indie rock’s most compelling and distinctive singers. He’s capable of projecting a wide, complex range of emotions—angry and defeated on “Hotel”, cautiously hopeful on “Intruders”. On the straightforward saunter of “Parade”, he takes on the ruminative prognostication of someone looking at a yearbook and wondering if the future and past possess any connection at all.</p>
<p>Lyrically, Silberman’s very much in his therapist’s-couch lane on <i>Familiars</i>, with a few subtle shifts in his mindset that you’d expect anyone currently reaching the end of their late 20s to undergo. “Maybe when I’m older,” he optimistically states in the beginning of “Intruders”, “I’ll be clearer/ More attuned and understanding.” On “Refuge”, he morbidly turns his gaze to what life’s endgame means—”When you lift me out of me/ Will I know when I’ve changed?”—but despite that and other brief meditations on death-as-release, <i>Familiars</i>’ thematic focus is a bit more scattered than Silberman name-checking <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> would have you believe. This time around, the theme he returns to most is identity—who we see when we look in the mirror, what happens when we don’t recognize who’s staring back—and on “Intruders”’ emotional peak, he confronts the terrifying possibility of encountering a dopplegänger with what sounds like murderous intentions: “When my double scales the wall/ I’ll know exactly where he’s landing/ And I’ll surprise him.”</p>
<p>Indeed, even as Silberman’s stuck with his most literary affectations—full-sentence lyrical statements, a heavy reliance on symbolism—he and the Antlers have loosened in terms of pretense over the last five years, taking on more self-absorbed concerns as their music has grown more insular and drowsy. The 28-year-old Silberman was barely of drinking age when he released music under the Antlers guise in earnest, and in the eight years since he and his band have aged publicly, charting their own distinct course while making music about the small-scale challenges faced when you feel truly lost in the world. Against all odds, they’ve become one of the most interesting indie rock bands working, and the stately beauty of <i>Familiars</i> is the latest satisfying effort from a band that continues to reward those listeners who give them the attention their elegant, secretly weird music deserves.</p></div>"|19453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19453-the-antlers-familiars/|7.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

Having emerged during the late-1990s post-rock boom, the Scottish quintet used every means possible to distance themselves from the sullen stereotype that defined so many instrumental art-rock brooders of their era. EP titles were <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Education_%3D_No_Future_(Fuck_the_Curfew)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">turned into protest placards</a>, interviews inevitably became <a href=""http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=127521"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">merciless slag fests</a>, and concert t-shirts <a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Vh2Q8SvGqZA/THXj8w8cn-I/AAAAAAAAAK4/fi4WDxKZeGc/s1600/DSC01264.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">doubled as a form of music criticism</a>. Even the abrupt calm-to-chaos eruptions that defined the band’s 1997 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11600-young-team-2008-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Young Team</i></a>, seemed to be delivered with devious, mischievous grins. So naturally, the band came up with a doozy of a title for their second album (and the first to receive a proper U.S. release via Matador): <i>Come On Die Young</i>, a <a href=""http://www.retromotorsportgear.com/images/product_images/product_image_59.gif"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two-fingered</a> retort to the “Live Forever” platitudes of the Britpop they so despised.<br/><br/>As such, it was no surprise that Mogwai’s would open the album with a song called “Punk Rock:”, even if it wasn’t a punk rock song at all. Rather, overtop a foreboding, percussion-less guitar instrumental, we hear the voice of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"">Iggy Pop</a> in a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-WxFyuHsbE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">televised 1977 interview with Canadian broadcaster Peter Gzowski</a>, explaining the difference between the commoner’s caricatured conception of punk and his own more spiritual, empowering interpretation of the term. But as much as it overtly asserts Mogwai’s allegiance to the rock iconoclasts of yore, the track also betrays the band’s own frustration with being misunderstood; beyond being propped up as post-rock poster boys, Mogwai had been variously hyped as the Scottish <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"">Slint</a> and the new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a>. Tellingly, “Punk Rock:” ends on an open-ended note, with an increasingly exasperated Iggy asking Gzowski, “Do you understand what I’m saying, sir?” The question is left hanging in the ether, as if to suggest that no amount of reasoning will change the opinions of those who’ve already made up their mind about you. <br/><br/>So on <i>Come On Die Young</i>, Mogwai went about becoming the most sullen, brooding post-rock band they could possibly be, with each melancholic guitar refrain and desolate, dead-of-night snare-drum tap serving as a deliberately set breadcrumb trail to more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19182-slint-spiderland-remastered-box-set/""><i>Spiderland</i></a> comparisons. But by playing to post-rock type, <i>Come On Die Young</i> ultimately expanded Mogwai’s emotional vocabulary. Where they once shocked with volume and dissonance, <i>Come On Die Young</i> disarms with elegance and grace. Even the sudden, eardrum-blasting jolts of <i>Young Team</i> signature “Like Herod” are no comparison to the surprise that occurs when the ominous, pressure-building hum of “Punk Rock:” dissolves into the teary-eyed tranquility of “Cody”, which sees Mogwai hitch themselves to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"">Galaxie 500</a>’s “Tugboat” and—thanks to a rare and surprisingly affecting lead vocal from guitarist Stuart Braithwaite—produce the most quietly devastating song in their canon to date. <br/><br/>By uncanny coincidence, this 15th-anniversary reissue arrives mere weeks after Slint’s more randomly timed 23rd-anniversary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19182-slint-spiderland-remastered-box-set/"" target=""_blank""><i>Spiderland</i> box set</a> was released, but revisiting both records in tandem highlights their differences as much as their similarities. Here, Mogwai aren’t so much copying Slint as envisioning the more expansive, exploratory band they could’ve evolved into: “Year 2000 Non-Compliant Cardia” may swipe its jagged opening strums straight from the “Good Morning Captain” playbook, but redirects them into a slumberous, opium-den psychedelia that counts as one of this album’s few moments of levity; “May Nothing But Happiness Come Through Your Door” embellishes the “Cortez the Killer”-inspired lurch of Slint’s “Washer” with glockenspieled counter-melodies and a gradually intensifying climax. And in lieu of creepily whispered Brian McMahan-style narratives, <i>Come On Die Young</i> sees Mogwai deploy found-sound dialogue to equally unnerving effect. The mournful “Helps Both Ways” is interlaced with color commentary from an NFL game, but far from undermining the track’s mournful tone, the chatter enhances it—the song feels like a cathode-ray-lit crime scene, as if we’re surveying the aftermath of some terrible domestic tragedy while ""Monday Night Football"" unsympathetically blares in the background. <br/><br/>So much instrumental rock music is often described as “soundtracks to movies that don’t exist,” but <i>Come On Die Young</i> always felt like the unofficial score to a film that did. Four months after the album was released, <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> hit theaters, and my memories of each tend to blur into one: there’s the shared desolate woodlands setting (the album was recorded at Dave Fridmann’s Tarbox Road Studios in Upstate New York) and chilly, frosty-breath atmosphere (thanks to Fridmann’s uncharacteristically stark, I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-Albini production), never mind the fact that <i>Come On Die Young</i>’s eerie cover shot of bassist Dominic Aitchison could easily pass for a still from the film. And most tellingly, like <i>Blair Witch</i>, <i>Come On Die Young</i> moves at a slow, subtle, incremental pace that can test one’s patience and make one long for the high-voltage immediacy of <i>Young Team</i>, but oh-so gradually ratchets up the tension. The heart-palpitating payoff finally arrives in the form of late-album colossi “Ex-Cowboy” and “Christmas Steps”, which once again see Mogwai charting new extremes of effects-pedal abuse, but without overwhelming the songs’ expertly chiseled definition.<br/><br/>That sense of discipline is all the more apparent when wading through the bounty of bonus material on this deluxe edition. While none of the demos here differ dramatically from their finished versions, you get a clearer picture of just how much<b> </b>studious fine-tuning went into the final tracklist: in its original form, “Christmas Steps” was a couple of minutes shorter, before the band wisely decided to stretch out its nerve-wracking build-up even longer; a rough-sketch version of “Punk Rock:” suggests even this seemingly simple composition underwent a few passes before achieving the right spectral ambience. (“Hugh Dallas”, meanwhile, would have been a keeper on any other Mogwai release, but its breathy Braithwaite vocal and elegiac sway drift a bit too closely to “Cody”.)</p>
<p>Some supplementary tracks, on the other hand, provide a welcome respite from <i>Come On Die Young</i>’s meticulous approach: the included <i>Travels in Constants, Vol. 12</i> EP—a limited-edition release for Temporary Residence’s mail-order series—both hearkens back to the post-shoegaze drone of Mogwai’s earliest work, while anticipating the anthemic surges of the subsequent <i>Rock Action</i>. The EP’s mix of tremulous guitar reverberations, flute-like melodies, and pretty piano reveries may boast a decidedly different tenor and texture than <i>Come On Die Young</i>, but are nonetheless a product of that album’s guiding philosophy: For all its seeming ideological alignment with crash-and-burn punk-rock nihilism, <i>Come On Die Young</i> is the sound of Mogwai committing themselves to the long haul.</p></div>"|19466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19466-mogwai-come-on-die-young-deluxe-edition/|8.3|Stuart Berman

To those in the know, there was legitimate concern that her new fan base might have been motivated by the novelty of the latter aspects, but Freedia's powerful, indelible charisma nonetheless transformed rooms full of normally staid indie rockers into a mob of sweaty, ass-shaking maniacs. With a seemingly never-ending series of tour dates and a reality show now entering its second season, it’s clear that Freedia's natural star power, rather than any identity-based quirks, drive her popularity. She’s teetering on the brink of reaching a mainstream audience, and<i> Just Be Free</i> is her attempt to bring her music to that level.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Freedia’s earlier material possessed a redlined sonic aesthetic that matched its manic energy, resembling a drum machine on the verge of a speed-driven breakdown through a maxed-out PA. Its raw, frenetic charge was a good match for her outsider status, but as they’ve charted a course for crossover success, she and longtime producer BlaqNmilD have changed their approach appropriately. With help from producer Thomas McElroy (Madonna, En Vogue), they’ve reworked Freedia’s trademark sound to make it cleaner, fuller, more nuanced, and more befitting a pop diva.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Much of <i>Just Be Free</i> is aimed squarely at an EDM audience that so far has somehow eluded Freedia, despite the fact that bounce has steadily grown in that world's presence—largely thanks to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a> and Nicky Da B's “Express Yourself”. “Turn Da Beat Up” expands Freedia’s sonic vocabulary to include <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3402-the-prodigy/"">Prodigy</a>-style breakbeats, precipitous bass drops, blatting low brass, and a four-on-the-floor breakdown that invokes both house music and arena-rock. “Dangerous” is festooned with filter sweeps, dubsteppy synth bubbles, and sub bass tuned for a large-scale sound systems. “Lift Dat Leg Up” has the epically scaled melody suited for the apex of a big-room DJ set.<span> Most notably, the album’s lead single “Explode” is a riot of overclocked drum machines and Freedia’s joyously hollered commands to lose yourself in her music. Just the idea of hearing it in a DJ set is enough to make you sweat.</span> </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As much as<i> Just Be Free</i> is intended to facilitate Freedia’s big break, it doesn’t neglect the fans who’ve followed her up to this point. While she makes some big strides here as an artist, she’s also made sure to keep one foot planted firmly in the style that some of us consider nearly perfect.<br/></span></p></div>"|19461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19461-big-freedia-just-be-free/|7.8|Miles Raymer

The methods of discovery, the sub-genre descriptors, and the artist names change, but that faith in some undiscovered loner who defies the odds and draws a diehard following (at least somewhat) independently has remained constant. In 2014, one of the most enticing of these bedroom singer/songwriters is Alex Giannascoli, a Temple University student who has built up an audience through putting material out there on the internet.</p>
<p>Recording as Alex G, the Pennsylvania native's gnarled, wobbly, unfailingly melodic guitar pop evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"">Built to Spill</a>, as well as more recent low-key breakouts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29667-youth-lagoon/"">Youth Lagoon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31136-jackson-scott/"">Jackson Scott</a>. His first-ever mastered full-length, <i>DSU</i>, also happens to be one of the first vinyl releases for Brooklyn's fledgling Orchid Tapes, which already this year has offered the emotion-wracked electronic dreamscapes of Ricky Eat Acid's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19056-ricky-eat-acid-three-love-songs/""><i>Three Love Songs</i></a>, along with the label comp <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19254-boring-ecstasy-the-bedroom-pop-of-orchid-tapes/""><i>Boring Ecstasy</i></a>. <i>DSU</i> is worthy of its moment, a 13-song set of warped, idiosyncratic sketches each capable of wending its way to a distinct place into the hearts of anyone who ever warmed to the idea of ""indie rock"".</p>
<p>The elements here are fairly limited, with spidery electric guitar, shambling acoustic guitar, and a smattering of watery keys joining rudimentary bass and drums to frame Giannascoli's sometimes pitch-shifted, fragile coo as he delivers sparse, impressionistic lyrics about the mundane. But what's impressive is the array of potent songs Alex G wrings from those basics, his self-recorded stone soup. There's the strummy innocence (and ambivalence about success) of ""Harvey"", the feedback-streaked pleading of ""Black Hair"" (""It's not what you are/ It's just what you did""), the barbed howls of ""Axesteel"". But there's also the PBR-spilling post-chillwave groove of ""Promise"", the frosty regret of ""Sorry"", and the stair-spiraling guitar anti-heroics of ""Serpent Is Lord"".</p>
<p>Giannascoli's voice is definitely of his do-it-yourself idiom; a comparison that strikes me is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2197-joan-of-arc/"">Joan of Arc</a> member Bobby Burg's Love of Everything project, so the arguably superfluous chipmunk'd effects on songs like the cavernous ""Icehead"" will probably be one of the record's more divisive decisions. But it's heartening that Alex G's willing to make off-kilter choices like that one, especially when he veers off into the oddball crackle at the end of ""Rejoyce"". Even the songs that are closer to fragments have memorable turns, like the wordless harmonies of ""Skipper"" or the piano goofing of ""Tripper"".</p>
<p>The most powerfully appealing song on <i>DSU </i>doesn't arrive until the end. ""Boy"" is one of the album's gentler tracks, a stray-dog reflection centered around piano and acoustic guitars; you could almost imagine it as some forgotten post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a> remnant that might've appeared on an early Wes Anderson soundtrack. ""I am not the boy you knew,"" Giannascoli insists. Fact is, he's another in a long line of young people who've found their own weird way to (only slightly) left-of-center acclaim.

White Lung’s bracing third LP <i>Deep Fantasy</i> is a product of its environment, that environment being “the real world in 2014,” filled with people who refuse to be a part of the solution because they won’t even admit there’s a problem.</p>
<p>So, White <span>Lung are not subtle. </span><span>But </span><i>Deep Fantasy</i><span> is definitely savvy, ensuring its staunch ideals are delivered by a riveting, relatable frontwoman and 22 minutes of vicious, compact musicianship and addictive melody</span><span>.</span><span> It’s an uncompromising feminist punk record that can be grasped by anyone who finds themselves compelled by kickass rock music and basic human decency.</span></p>
<p>The importance of White Lung’s potential reach can’t be overstated. Formative influence Courtney Love has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9395-courtney-love/"">specifically expressed hope</a> for White Lung to “achieve some kind of mainstream success”, noting, “It means there are more people listening, and you're affecting the zeitgeist more.”<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> It’s hard to imagine a rock band of any kind to be allowed the platform that </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole"" target=""_blank"">Hole</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, or even less commercially fortunate acts like L7 and Babes in Toyland, could have two decades ago. However, </span><i>Deep Fantasy</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is being put out by the same people responsible for </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/259-arctic-monkeys"" target=""_blank"">Arctic Monkeys</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> records.  In 2014, this is the equivalent of a major-label debut.</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><br/> </span></p>
<p>The result is a best case scenario retaining the accessibility that marked White Lung’s 2012 breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16897-sorry""><i>Sorry</i></a>, while amplifying the parts that translate to a bigger stage. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><i>Sorry </i>producer Jesse Gander returns, and he did a pretty good job last time a long-overlooked Vancouver punk band had the opportunity to put everything on the line.</span>  As on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"">Japandroids</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16564-japandroids-celebration-rock""><i>Celebration Rock</i></a>, the sound of <i>Deep Fantasy</i> is not slick so much as knife-like: piercing, bright, precise and forged under a great amount of pressure.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And it leads with the sharpest part<b>—</b>opening duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16739-white-lung-drown-with-the-monster/"">“Drown With the Monster”</a> and “Down it Goes” assumes you’ve never heard White Lung before, and they're the best and hookiest demonstrations of what they <i>do</i>. These are doomed, minor-key dirges sped up to the point where they become anthemic, performed at the highest possible velocity where they can still qualify as potential pop. Anticipatory guitar roars are required to take off after Anne-Marie Vassiliou's held cymbal-crash introductions and they keep pace with a rigid, doubled-up hardcore rhythm and fill-free drumming. Mish Way often inverts typical song structure, hanging high notes perilously over sludgy, drop-D chords in the verse while she takes a lower, more menacing and tense register on the choruses. Guitarist Kenneth Williams uses technical precision for texture, as harmonics and high treble flicker like sparks from a buzzsaw against metal. </p>
<p>It’s thrilling, and White Lung don’t do much else from that point on. Even compared to 2014’s other high-profile, high-BPM, sub-half-hour <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19086-perfect-pussy-say-yes-to-love"">feminist punk LP</a>, <i>Deep Fantasy</i> is sonically blinkered<b>—</b>there are no ballads, no ambient noise instrumentals, and the few seconds of feedback that close the album is about as close as you get to “atmosphere.” White Lung does just about one thing musically on <i>Deep Fantasy</i>, but it's one thing that no one else is doing right now. Though often positioned in the lineage of bands from a time when Lollapalooza was a traveling circus, White Lung are a modern creation, their kohl-streaked punk more <i>Black Sails in the Sunset</i> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"">Black Flag</a>. Occasionally, the cohesion of <i>Deep Fantasy</i> can be taxing, but for the time being, this is the band taking <i>their</i> sound as far as it can go.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Way's lyrics can be just as condensed as the music itself, but they're more like concentrate, expanding on contact and allowing the listener to come up with their own formulation.</span> Considering ""Drown With the Monster""'s nasty snarl of a hook, some poor sap from an energy drink company might try to mindlessly co-opt it for a commercial, which is a tribute to how open-ended “Drown” is; Way struggles with an undefined addiction and never quite says whether she’s giving in, giving up, or giving herself another chance to fight. “Down It Goes” and “Snake Jaw” are likewise dense and comprehensive, touching on the threatening imbalance in sexual pursuit  (“You fear my thick skin/ I’m thinking there’s a knife”), dysmorphia (""You drag me behind/ Like bitter squirming swine""), body image (“If I get fat one day, will you run away?/ I’ll starve if you promise to save me”) and disordered eating (""Here comes my dinner now/ It's for the win"").</p>
<p><i>Deep Fantasy</i> does work best as a multimedia affair; it almost certainly requires its lyric sheet to be understood, and Way’s <a href=""http://music.thetalkhouse.com/artist/mish-way/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">outside</a> <a href=""http://mishway.com/?page_id=4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing</a> supplements her work rather than disenfranchising the listener of their personal interpretation. At <i>Deep Fantasy</i>'s center, there’s one song that can be effectively heard as a straightforward demonstration of self-confidence, of friendship, of support. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9399-white-lung/"" target=""_blank"">Way explained that it’s the one written as a reaction to rape culture</a>, and it takes on a new, demolishing power upon the realization that its title is the last thing a sexual assault accuser is likely to hear<b>—</b>“I Believe You”.</p>
<p>Just about every aspect of White Lung’s music is aggressive and <i>sounds</i> angry and invective, though “I Believe You” stresses the resonance and empathy; while Way’s philosophical and theoretical leanings might not be considered “mainstream,” <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">it’s a compliment to </span><i>Deep Fantasy</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> to say that none of its calls for dignity, for humanity, for understanding sounds remotely radical—rather, they’re pretty fucking rational.</span> Plenty of people with progressive tastes in politics and pop culture still could reasonably think “feminist punk” (or <i>any</i> political variant of <i>any</i> music) isn’t something they’d necessarily enjoy listening to, and while Hole sold millions of records, surely a great deal had access to their underlying message because they saw “Miss World” jammed between Live and Candlebox videos on MTV. This is principled music, not doctrine, and while inspired by its surroundings, it’s defined by its leader making bracing art. <i>Deep Fantasy</i> is a product of its environment, as well as one hell of a survival guide to live through this.</p></div>"|19460.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19460-white-lung-deep-fantasy/|8.6|Ian Cohen

The instrument of her noble pursuit is an extravagant, elegiac solo: her axe weeps and wails like a professional mourner, eventually tearing the surrounding space asunder to allow everything—the dark and the light, the leaden and the featherweight—to rush in. It's this sensation that's earned the Japanese trio a seat at the pantheon of heaviness: this alchemy by which the act of listening to loud rock music is transformed into an encounter with the sublime.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A self-proclaimed “noise” band renowned for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"" target=""_blank"">Melvins</a>-style sludge and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11696-at-last-feedbacker-sun-baked-snow-cave-with-merzbow-akuma-no-uta/"" target=""_blank"">Merzbow collaborations</a>, Boris excel at playing around with magnitudes. But they’re sneakier than they appear: their true calling card isn't brute force, but carefully calculated punishment. <span style=""font-size: 15px;"">The patient approach that Boris took on 2000's </span><i>Flood</i><span><i> </i>indicated that</span><i> </i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">they’d rather have listeners climb the summit slowly, stopping to admire the pretty scenery up to the moment that they hit the precipice and tumble into a free-fall. With the release of their new LP </span><i>Noise,</i><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> all of the panoramas the band has crafted over the past two decades<span style=""font-size: 15px;"">—stoner rock, shoegaze, ambient, pop</span>—have coalesced into one massive, smoldering landscape</span><i>. </i>E<span style=""font-size: 15px;"">ighteen-minute mammoths stride alongside sprightly two-minute cuts, thrash metal pops up out of nowhere to stick a shiv in post-rock’s back. Imposing, insane, and all-over-the-place: in other words, par for Boris' course.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Noise </i>boasts one of the most engaging openers on a Boris album to date: the haunting, and disarmingly catchy “Melody”. The persistent downward pull of the guitars creates a grungy line of tension that the band is all too willing to exploit. Ever wonder what it would sound like if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1682-garbage/"" target=""_blank"">Garbage</a> went avant? Wonder no more: through smooth harmonies and even smoother production, Boris replicates the blueprint of slick alternative rock and then some, both on “Melody” and its craggier cousin “Vanilla”. On the other hand, the limp “wo-oah”s and recycled wasted-youth tropes of “Taiyo no Baka” present irrefutable proof that Boris aren't cut out for pop.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Between the rabid hardcore of the nine-minute “Quicksilver” and the slow, steady suffocation of “Heavy Rain”, fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1185-pink/""><i>Pink </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15460-attention-please-heavy-rocks/""><i>Heavy Rocks </i></a>will most likely find something to enjoy on <i>Noise</i>. That said, there’s a fine line between drone and fatigue, and at times, Boris get bogged down by the latter on many of the longer songs. Delicate as it may be, even the the final portion of “Angel” can’t help but feel like a slog when it features several minutes of insignificant repetition. </p>
<p class=""p1"">To listeners who are intimidated by the prospect of leaping into the band’s extensive discography<i>, </i><i>Noise</i> provides a better incentive: as both look back and a step forward, it serves as a possible gateway album, and more intriguingly, it hints at a new chapter in the band’s chameleonic career through which all their scattered points of reference might operate in beautiful, deadly unison.</p></div>"|19300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19300-boris-noise/|7.8|Zoe Camp

Both the Capsoul and Way Out labels were based in Ohio, the former in Columbus (hence the ""Cap"" in ""Capsoul"") and the latter up in Cleveland, but these collections' near-concurrent release and Ohio-based commonality hide the fact that both of these collections fascination for entirely different reasons.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Eccentric Soul: Capitol City Soul</i><span> is notably symbolic—it bears the catalog number of 51, marking the 50th release for the label since 2004's </span><span><i>Eccentric Soul: The Capsoul Label</i></span><span>.

And yet, after launching renewed interest in the Capsoul label with their first release, Numero's staff discovered that the label's influence was significantly wider in the Columbus area than the scraped-together remnants of Moss' collection even hinted at. </span><i>Capitol City Soul</i><span>'s 20 tracks include long-lost material by Capsoul acts highlighted on the first collection; four unreleased recordings by the sweet-harmonizing Four Mints and a trio of raw but powerful demos by the balladeers Kool Blues are ideal supplements to the material unearthed 10 years ago.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But the artists that show up here from affiliated labels and other Capsoul-orbiting spots in the local soul circuit make for equally compelling surprises—if not as musicians, then as stories, though usually both. A handful of mid-late '60s tapes by a group called the Chandlers were pulled off the shelves of the still-operating Musicol studio and reveal a band deeply in tune with the Motown sound, yet still operating in a stripped-down mode that foregoes dense orchestration and production for more tight-knit group dynamics. Drummer Dean Francis and his group the Soul Rockers contribute a couple tracks that slot somewhere between Memphis twang/scratch and Bay-to-Georgia brass, with ""Funky Disposition"" providing both the collection's best James Brown analogue and a sketched-out technical diagram loosely outlining the song's accompanying dance move. And in an inspired bit of sequencing, the Soul Partners' Southern-fried, horn-driven deep soul cut ""Lose the One You Love"" and the Vondors' more Midwestern-leaning, harmony-backed cosmopolitan soul number ""Look in the Mirror"" are put back-to-back—they're the same band, wrangled into double duty by Moss to ramp up his chances of getting his label's 45s on the radio. Can't fault a man for being a little dishonest in the service of some solid jams, though. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Where </span><i>Capitol City Soul </i><span>serves as a long-brewing second chapter in a previously told story—a chapter that's more beneficial for its exhaustive nature and close focus on a handful of artists than its quality as a front-to-back listen—</span><i>The Way Out Label </i><span>is a stranger, more unwieldy, and ultimately more interesting collection. Much is made in the liner notes of <i>Way Out</i>'s location in a rough area of Cleveland's east side, where the studio was protected on off hours by a trigger-on-a-string shotgun trap hooked up to a doorknob. Skimming through the archival materials in the liner sends you careening through an abstracted assemblage of vintage R&amp;B history from the tail end of the doo-wop era through the full bloom of psychedelic soul. (The latter is memorably played up by an ad for the Sensations: ""Who knows what </span><span>sounds</span><span> lurk in the hearts of men? The Sensations know. They've crossed the time zone deep into the '70s. And listened. Surrender now to the new experience."") And the connections, deals, and discoveries laid out in the liner notes' narrative is a sprawling tour through a succession of unlikely characters: a singer named William Bell who, after his group the Soul Notes disbanded, traveled down to Memphis for a Stax audition and was informed for presumably the first time that they already had a William Bell on their roster; Laura Greene, a singer who jumped from Way Out to a succession of major labels, then to an acting role in Robert Downey, Sr.'s 1969 ad-world spoof </span><i>Putney Swope</i><span> before appearing in TV commercials for real; NFL icon Jim Brown, whose financial patronage in helping break Way Out on a wider scale was rewarded with an extremely short-lived vanity label called Big Jim.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And the music on the collection, 40 tracks in all, is just as dizzying in its reach. It runs the gamut from the vintage soul of 1964 sides by Lou Ragland &amp; the Bandmasters—keening, ghostly doo-wop on ""Never Let Me Go"", sax-blasting instrumental house party soundtrack on ""Party at Lester's""—through the waning days of 1972-73 and the valiant attempts by artists like Jesse Fisher (""Why"", ""Don't Cheat on Me"") and Sammy Jones (""You've Got to Show Me"", ""She Didn't Know"") to keep <i>Way Out</i>'s pulse beating through velvety loverman grooves. Picking out a peak era for the label is thankfully tricky, as the lush mid-late '60s sides by orchestrally backed vocal group the Sensations, the Soul Notes' sophisticated intensity (get a load of William Bell's breathless out-of-nowhere mid-song narrative on ""I Got Everything I Need""), and the bittersweet yearning of Bobby Wade's belting on his late early '70s 45s (""Can't You Hear Me Calling""; ""I'm In Love With You""; ""Four Walls and a Window"") all make a case for Way Out's potential to become a sort of Brunswick on the Erie. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like their Columbus counterpart in Capsoul, Way Out saw its end before the '70s hit their midpoint. And like Capsoul, they've also been done thorough justice by the kind of archivists who know full well that music doesn't have to reach millions to mean something—especially when it's so easy to hear echoes of other familiar pasts inside it.</span></p></div>"|19459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19459-capitol-city-soul-the-way-out-label/|7.7|Nate Patrin

It runs the gamut from the vintage soul of 1964 sides by Lou Ragland &amp; the Bandmasters—keening, ghostly doo-wop on ""Never Let Me Go"", sax-blasting instrumental house party soundtrack on ""Party at Lester's""—through the waning days of 1972-73 and the valiant attempts by artists like Jesse Fisher (""Why"", ""Don't Cheat on Me"") and Sammy Jones (""You've Got to Show Me"", ""She Didn't Know"") to keep <i>Way Out</i>'s pulse beating through velvety loverman grooves. Picking out a peak era for the label is thankfully tricky, as the lush mid-late '60s sides by orchestrally backed vocal group the Sensations, the Soul Notes' sophisticated intensity (get a load of William Bell's breathless out-of-nowhere mid-song narrative on ""I Got Everything I Need""), and the bittersweet yearning of Bobby Wade's belting on his late early '70s 45s (""Can't You Hear Me Calling""; ""I'm In Love With You""; ""Four Walls and a Window"") all make a case for Way Out's potential to become a sort of Brunswick on the Erie. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like their Columbus counterpart in Capsoul, Way Out saw its end before the '70s hit their midpoint. And like Capsoul, they've also been done thorough justice by the kind of archivists who know full well that music doesn't have to reach millions to mean something—especially when it's so easy to hear echoes of other familiar pasts inside it.</span></p></div>"|19459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19459-capitol-city-soul-the-way-out-label/|8.0|Nate Patrin

The shambling, acoustic opener “Bird on Broken Wing” (which is dedicated to the memory of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26811-pete-seeger/"">Pete Seeger</a>) is filled with background noise, the bustle of busy bodies barking or conversing or just bumping into things. It’s the kind of ambient noise that might ruin a take by another band or at least get edited out before the song makes its way onto an album. With the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5686-the-felice-brothers/"">Felice Brothers</a>, however, that dog bark conveys a sense of informality, reminding you that the band recorded live and casually, with no regard for polish or perfection. That’s how rock and roll is supposed to be played, right?</p>
<p>But it’s even more crucial to <i>Favorite Waitress</i>, which marks the first time the Felices have recorded in a proper studio rather than high schools or chicken coops. For <i>Favorite Waitress,</i> the group piled in a van and drove from their home in Woodstock, New York all the way out to Omaha, Nebraska, workshopping these new tunes along the way. They recorded in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27943-mike-mogis/"">Mike Mogis</a>’ Arc Studio, with long-time producer Jeremy Backofen at the helm. Lest you think they’ve cleaned up their sound or abandoned their rowdy and rustic ethos: woof.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s almost too perfect and planned, as though they set the dog up in his own little booth to get that short exclamation. While the Felices project a world-weary and ramshackle aesthetic, their music is actually very deliberate and calculated. They’re one of surprisingly few acts that can hold a stage with a string band like Old Crow Medicine Show, or with a rock band like Dawes or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5492-deer-tick/"">Deer Tick</a>. Vocalist Ian Felice peppers his lyrics with proper nouns, and to his credit he mixes the old (Henry James) with the new (Harry Potter), as if to suggest the new America is just as weird as the old America. On the other hand, he can barely get away with a line like “I’ll be Butch Cassidy and you can be the Sundance Kid,” from “Meadow of a Dream”. That song just falls apart, thanks to asinine wordplay like, “I ain’t the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Boss</a>, but I’m his illegitimate son, ‘cause baby, I was born to run.” That’s worse than anything off <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18833-bruce-springsteen-high-hopes/"">High Hopes</a>.</i></p>
<p>Especially after the garish electronic elements and dancehall atmosphere on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15401-celebration-florida/"">Celebration, Florida</a></i>, the Felices play it a bit safer on <i>Favorite Waitress</i>, once again displaying a broad palette—a bit of zydeco here, some piano balladry there, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/614-the-band/"">Band</a> references everywhere else. As a unit, they’re nimble and assured, emphasizing fluid transitions and brazen contrasts between styles. The result is a heady roots rock that flaunts its unpredictability and doggedly strives against convention. On the other hand, for all their Boss and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22874-elvis-presley/"">King</a> allusions (“I’m the new Elvis, covered in my enemies’ blood!”), the Felices understand “rock” as a noun, not a verb. These songs lumber and splay, all gangly melodies and world-weary croaks. Even “Woman Next Door”, the fastest and heaviest number here, trips over its own feet as it tries to locate the groove.</p>
<p>Too often <i>Favorite Waitress</i> sounds too too clever to accommodate something as visceral as a groove. Only on “Cherry Licorice”, with its spoken introduction and its AABB rhyme scheme, does the band come alive and craft something unself-consciously affecting. The lyrics are goofy and slapdash, as though written seconds before they were sung, and the band backs Ian like they’re drunk and trying to remember how “I Want Candy” goes. “All I want to eat is cherry licorice,” he slurs. “I don’t care if it sounds ridiculous.” That’s precisely how it sounds, which makes it the most joyful and unguarded song on the album. </p></div>"|19452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19452-the-felice-brothers-favorite-waitress/|5.6|Stephen M.

Reissue culture <a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/browse/albums/release-date/new-releases/metascore"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tilts critical scales</a> and <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/15031-record-store-day-2014-problems-distribution-vinyl"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gums up record pressing plants</a>, and it’s not enough now to simply reissue a forgotten album and allow it bask in the spotlight of public consciousness for one fleeting moment more. Forgotten records–no matter how obscure—now receive additional adornment in the form of feature-length documentaries, reunion tours, and demo-scraping follow-ups, all wringing out every last drop of interest in the original record.</p>
<p>When LITA reissued Sixto Rodriguez’s two studio albums back in 2008, it sparked an Academy-winning documentary film and countless sold-out stadium shows. Drag City unearthed the raw power of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12673-for-the-whole-world-to-see/"">Death</a>, which led to a documentary, a tour with the surviving members, and two more demo-scraping albums. It’s but two examples of this exhaustive trend. Donnie &amp; Joe Emerson, the two rural Washington farm boys who had a log cabin studio replete with “Camp Jammin’” concert venue built for the teen boys to realize their musical vision in, were beneficiaries of this reissue trend as well. And the reissue of forgotten homemade album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16841-dreamin-wild/""><i>Dreamin’ Wild</i></a>, was well-deserved, meaning that some four decades after having that dream go unrealized, the brothers got to play their first-ever live shows in Seattle and New York City. <i> <br/></i></p>
<p><i>Still Dreamin’ Wild: The Lost Recordings 1979-81</i> presents that secondary stage of reissue culture, culling demos in the years after the younger Emerson graduated high school and began traveling to Los Angeles in the hopes of realizing his teenage dreams. Older brother Joe was already turning his attentions to the family farm, his presence only heard on two of the album’s twelve tracks. Donnie’s polymath musical skills are on full display, from drums to poly-Moog synth, and his ability to mimic the more popular hits on the radio of the day remains uncanny.</p>
<p>While <i>Dreamin’ Wild</i> seemed to float just out of its time, <i>Still Dreamin’</i> for the most part embraces the tropes of early '80s pop radio. Had “Overture” lasted beyond a half-minute, it might have been a lost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"">Panda Bear</a> track, but it instead leads into the clean guitars and drums of “Don’t Fight.” The uptempo “Big Money”, featuring brother Joe’s walloping drums, is an album highlight, even if it only lasts two minutes.</p>
<p>That perceived “songs of innocence” sentiment of <i>Dreamin’ Wild</i> is tempered a bit here. “Ride the Tide” is about a lady in Los Angeles who comes and goes, a surfer girl who toys with the country boy’s heart. Donnie’s layered vocals convey that sense of confusion and heartbreak, but the chintzy synth line and tinny drums undercut it. Same goes for “Everybody Knows It”, whose synth presets border on karaoke backing track. The guitar tone of “Ooh Baby Yeah” evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star"">Big Star</a> for a moment, before it smoothes out into a pedestrian oldies track.</p>
<p>Rather than the wonder and sincere ache of something like “My Heart” or “Baby” from <i>Dreamin’ Wild</i>, the album too often brings up memories of treacly early '80s AOR, from Don Henley to Jackson Browne to Kenny Loggins. That isn't inherently a bad thing: In another world, I can envision Donnie Emerson opening for the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"">the War on Drugs</a>, who similarly take the most cringeworthy of '80s productions styles and amalgamate them into something transcendent. In the review of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16841-dreamin-wild/""><i>'Dreamin Wild</i></a>, I cited the likes of Chuck Mangione, Bread, and Boz Scaggs, but this time around, these songs fail to transcend such influences.</p></div>"|19451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19451-donnie-joe-emerson-still-dreamin-wild-the-lost-recordings-1979-81/|6.3|Andy Beta

She’s an utterly distinctive figure in popular music—not part of a scene, with no serious imitators—and befitting someone completely off on her own, she’s lonely. Where her last full-length, the frequently terrible <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16223-lana-del-rey/""><i>Born to Die</i></a>, tried on different moods and looked at her character from a few angles, <i>Ultraviolence</i> finds one feeling—a seedy, desperate, hyper-romanticized sense of isolation and loss—and blows it up to drive-in screen proportions, saturating the color riding the blue crest of sadness for the better part of an hour. Whether or not you want to take this particular ride will largely depend on how much stock you put in “authenticity,” your tolerance for Del Rey’s vocal tics, and your reflexive response to her lyrics.</p>
<p>Creating a semi-fictional delivery system for your creative ideas is nothing new, but few have had Del Rey’s commitment to the idea—imagine Madonna sticking with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16223-lana-del-rey/"">Breathless Mahoney</a> for multiple album cycles. This far in, after so many interviews and so much media attention, we don’t know all that much about Lana Del Rey, and we’re not sure what we’re told is real. She’s become a screen onto which we project our desire and/or our loathing. With <i>Ultraviolence</i>, Del Rey has found new synergy between the character she presents to the world and the content of the songs.</p>
<p>Gone are annoying trifles like <i>Born to Die</i>’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6K8Uq88BEQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carmen</a>” and “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sap8TcoJpZw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Diet Mountain Dew</a>”; in their place are slow, atmospheric songs filled with theatrical melancholy and a parade of women in trouble who mourn for men who treat them badly yet somehow remain irresistible. The lyrics are studded with her trademark iconography: “he hit me and it felt like a kiss”; “the sun also rises”; “talking about my generation”; a reference to “Sunset and Vine” and another to “strange weather.” But here she’s found the perfect musical vehicle for her vision. <i>Ultraviolence</i> sounds tragic and beautiful—darkly-shaded ballads are what she was created to make, and this album is nothing but, a Concept Album from a Concept Human.</p>
<p>The first section of the album is so gorgeous and rich, <i>Ultraviolence</i> at first seems better than it is. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"">The Black Keys</a>’ Dan Auerbach, who produced much of the record, turns out to be Del Rey's ideal creative partner, crafting lush walls of sound that evoke her favorite cultural era, a time when the prim and surface-level 1960s were just starting their slide into drug-fueled decadence. “Cruel World” is a six-minute dirge that 30 years ago might have been sung by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8VGQTtENSs&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bonnie Tyler</a>, its twangy guitars and thudding drums exploding at just the right moments. The title track’s gorgeous chorus dresses up a song where love and physical abuse are intertwined. Del Rey’s angelic interval leap on the chorus of “Shades of Cool” is a new addition to her small array of vocal effects, bringing to mind the faux-Asian sweep of Nancy Sinatra’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFtQPgHyek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You Only Live Twice</a>” mixed with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgaREJnNgFg&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song that lured the prince in Disney’s <i>Sleeping Beauty</i></a>. They’re songs that would make no sense if anyone else sang them. In this way, and a few others, she draws inspiration from rap music, broadcasting her obsessions and forcing you to engage with the persona first and the content of the songs second.</p>
<p>It’s an impressive opening shot, and there are a few moments in this sequence that make you want to sit back and say, “Hold on, is this for real?” But then comes “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55496-lana-del-rey-shares-brooklyn-baby/"">Brooklyn Baby</a>”, a song that references Lou Reed, a rare jazz collection, feathers in hair, the “freedom land of the ’70s,” and “churning out novels like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63_BMNxTces"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">beat poetry</a> on amphetamines.” Is Del Rey taking the piss, making fun of lifestyle accessories as a source of identity? Or is she celebrating these icons, the way she has so many others, reveling in the colorful tapestry that is American popular culture?</p>
<p>Turns out these are the wrong questions. When lines like these pop up on the record, I find myself chuckling, sometimes laughing out loud, which might seem odd on an album about sadness. But that says something about how strange Del Rey's music can be, and the internal coherence of the worlds she creates. These songs don’t ask you to respond in any particular way; they evoke heartbreak one moment and they’re ridiculous the next, and those qualities don’t cancel each other out. It’s <i>entertainment</i>, camp, and the ambiguity of it all, nurtured by the cool distance of Lana Del Rey’s image, is a huge part of the music’s appeal. Those who <i>really</i> hate what she’s about—and there are a lot of these people—look for something in music that she has no interest in providing. To enjoy what she does, you have to give yourself over to her media-saturated fantasy and put the everyday on hold, and you also have to lay aside pop radio’s typically sunny affirmations.</p>
<p>But this thing Lana Del Rey is going for isn’t easy to sustain, and it starts to go south during the back half of <i>Ultraviolence</i>. The album grows tiresome somewhere during the stretch where “Pretty When You Cry” leads to “Money Power Glory” and then on to “Fucked My Way Up to the Top”. The melodies are a little less interesting and, instead of melodramatic fables, she settles for button-pushing. It’s also wearying to spend this much time in the presence of this particular character. The masochism, the self-hatred, the drugs, the emotional world filtered through the tragic figures American teenagers are drawn to gets old. You can feel Lana Del Rey inching into territory where she’s daring you not to like her, and by the time you get to the <i>Ultraviolence</i> bonus track “Florida Kilos”, a Harmony Korine co-write that might as well be called <i>Spring Breakers: The Audiobook</i>, you begin to remember why many people find the whole project repellant. Still, it’d be wrong to overlook the many things <i>Ultraviolence</i> does well, and how <i>sui generis</i> Lana Del Rey is. She’s a pop music original full-stop, and there are not nearly enough of those around.</p></div>"|19449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19449-lana-del-rey-ultraviolence/|7.1|Mark Richardson

For some, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10541-janet-jackson/"">the end comes suddenly and without warning</a>, while others experience a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22529-whitney-houston/"">slow</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">bewildering</a> decline into mediocrity. After two decades of nearly uninterrupted chart dominance, one figures that Mariah Carey has spent some of the last year dwelling on the end of her reign. Her 13th album, <i>Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive Chanteuse</i>, comes on the heels of her most trying period since the infamous <i>Glitter</i> bomb of 13 years ago. The rollout for <i>I Am Mariah</i> kicked off in earnest almost two years ago with a single called ""Triumphant (Get 'Em)"", and three other singles followed—one of which, ""The Art of Letting Go,"" has been relegated to bonus track status—with only the strummy, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a>-powered ""#Beautiful"" climbing up the charts. But even that song peaked outside the top 10 of the Billboard's Hot 100, which is basically unheard of for a major single from a Mariah Carey album.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the circumstances, <i>I Am Mariah</i> is not an album that sounds desperate. It makes an argument for Mariah letting pop stardom come as it does— or doesn't—and the record seemingly acknowledges her increasingly murky future by looking back at loves and sounds of the past. She is not Jennifer Lopez or Madonna, leaving smudged fingerprints on the zeitgeist; <i>I Am Mariah</i> does not bend toward the whims of the radio. The album sounds exactly, defiantly like Mariah, acknowledging her place in the pop ecosystem both implicitly and explicitly without chomping at the bit.</p>
<p>The album was executive produced by Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, a duo who helped jumpstart Mariah's career the first time it flagged. It was Dupri and Carey who wrote ""We Belong Together"", the impossibly huge smash that reestablished Mariah as a pop titan in 2005, the last time she risked fading away. Cox pitched in on ""Shake It Off,"" the breezy summer follow-up that cemented that status. On <i>I Am Mariah</i>, the three of them circle back to the ethos of <i>The Emancipation of Mimi</i>—the album that held those songs—using classic, stately R&amp;B as a sort of gold-threaded cocoon.</p>
<p>That's not to say that <i>I Am Mariah </i>is reductive; on the contrary, the record pares her sound down to its essence while simultaneously subtly expanding its parameters. Two tracks feature contributions by James ""Big Jim"" Wright—also a holdover from the <i>Emancipation</i> era—and those songs are ballads that weave the slurred organs of gospel into the album. ""Cry."" opens the record with Mariah's vocals suspended over a soft cloud of pianos; though she sings about angels' tears in typically dramatic fashion, the track highlights her ability to strike a vocal balance between restraint and power. ""One More Try"", a faithful and fantastic cover of the George Michael song, pushes the track from the mist of the '80s into the filtered sunlight of church, giving it a glow while still retaining its throbbing ache.</p>
<p>The Dupri and Cox cut ""You Don't Know What to Do"" is a straight up disco song with rippling guitars and strings that swoop down like birds. (As always, it's best to ignore <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10147-wale/"">Wale</a> here.) The song recalls her untouchable roller-rink jams like ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Fantasy"" while also feeling like a logical extension of post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell</a> disco revivalism. This trio of tracks are the implicit acknowledgement of her age: gospel and disco are traditionally genres where middle-aged women can thrive, and Mariah—a legendarily strong voice—fits in unsurprisingly well. There are a few tracks that don't work—""Heavenly (No Ways Tired/Can't Give Up Now)"" hauls in an over-the-top choir, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip"">Q-Tip</a>-produced ""Meteorite"" is a gloopy scoop of Cher schmaltz—but largely, the record finds Mariah easily settling into what could be her post-pop phase.</p>
<p>And yet, <i>I Am Mariah</i> is definitely not post-pop. The album's other major collaborator is the G.O.O.D. Music secret weapon <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31181-hit-boy/"">Hit-Boy</a>, who helms three of the album's strongest tracks. ""Thirsty"" is a bleepy take-off of ""Niggas in Paris"", but his style meshes well with Mariah's: she can carry a club track, obviously, but the chorus here is an ethereal puff that melts his signature icy minimalism. ""Money ($ * / ..)"" clips a greasy horn riff into a loop you could imagine hearing on today's pop radio, but Mariah floats over it gracefully. These tracks, along with the washed-out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"">Mike WiLL Made It</a> elegy ""Faded,"" show that Mariah can still conversate with pop music, even if pop music doesn't talk back.</p>
<p>Still, the two best tracks on <i>I Am Mariah</i> make more explicit references to time passed. ""Supernatural"" features ""Ms. Monroe &amp; Mr. Moroccan Scott Cannon a.k.a Roc 'N Roe"", which is Mariah's very theatrical way of saying ""my kids"". The ballad, a Dupri and Cox number, has a beat that approximates a baby's mobile and a constant stream of coos from the twins themselves. The backdrop puts her newfound motherhood to the forefront, as Mariah delivers the album's most heartfelt devotional and its most astonishing, acrobatic vocal performance.</p>
<p>The true highlight is the Hit-Boy-assisted ""Dedicated"", built on a loop of Inspectah Deck rapping ""carry like Mariah"" on ""Da Mystery of Chessboxin'"". The song opens with dialogue between Mariah and longtime rap executive Steve Stoute about nostalgia. She sings about a long-lost love—""I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to ya""—before referencing Eric B. and the Wu and interpolating Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh. The song is wistful, with a streak of melancholy, but it's also upbeat, and has the glimmer of indulgent memory. ""Oh, baby, you know,"" she sings, her voice falling like a feather. ""All that love-making we did, boy, it was so real, I wanna feel that again."" Surrounded by the chatter of old friends and older beats, she's rarely sounded as comfortable.</p></div>"|19399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19399-mariah-carey-me-i-am-mariahthe-elusive-chanteuse/|7.7|Jordan Sargent

For many people, particularly in America, hearing the name “Klaxons” immediately opens a time warp back to the DayGlo nights of 2007, when terms like “nu-rave” and “blog-house” were spoken with straight faces and a lack of impunity. 2. It is 2014 now, and Klaxons have made a new album that, quite frankly, is pretty darn boring. However, the second fact is not a direct result of the first—this is correlation, not causation, and even if the terminology and fashion of “nu-rave” hasn’t aged well, its mission to present the 24 hour party plan of rave within a rock band context is as old as rave itself.

<p dir=""ltr"">And that’s an odd issue to have with Klaxons, who put a lot of effort into establishing their previous guise, affixing the prolix lyrics and dubious mysticism of prog onto taut, glowstick-waving pop songs. <span>It proved surprisingly malleable as they made a nu-rave-to-nu-metal transition from their electro-shocked debut to the Ross Robinson-produced </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14597-surfing-the-void/"" target=""_blank"">Surfing the Void</a>.</i><span> It’s understandable they’d want to expand: </span><span>after all, both </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10133-myths-of-the-near-future/"" target=""_blank""><i>Myths of the Near Future</i></a><span> and </span><i>Surfing the Void</i><span> were enjoyable, but also top-heavy and ephemeral. </span>Yet, while Jamie Reynolds alludes to a biblical vision quest on “Rhythm of Life”, the Klaxons return from their 40 days and 40 nights in exile (or, more, accurately, four years) having taken on perhaps the single-most common form of non-American dance-rock hybrids: that of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFuE-thYZ1A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Don’t Fight It, Feel It”</a> shamanism. The song titles could pass for Madchester Successories<span>—</span>“Children of the Sun”, “A New Reality”, “Invisible Forces”, “There is No Other Time”. Just by scanning the tracklist, you know what to expect.</p>
<p>Beyond the lack of imagination, <i>Love Frequency</i> is a baggy record regardless of which definition you prefer, whether it’s hearkening to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pn3q09x41A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Loose Fit”</a> or just the way their previously punchy hooks have been swapped out for paunchy beats. Synthesized drums bang with almost no variation for up to five minutes at a time, an introductory chorus explains the song’s title before shifting to a custodial, time-killing verse—and then it returns in time to remind you which song is “Show Me a Miracle” and which one is “Invisible Forces”. It’s pointless to quote the lyrics at length, not because they’re ridiculous, but because they’re not ridiculous <i>enough </i>to generate the kind of conviction you need to pull this stuff off. Reynolds sings, “We’re the masters of distraction/ In a time of hyperaction” on “A New Reality”, and it's unclear as to whether Klaxons want to be part of the problem or part of the solution, or whether they have <i>any</i> idea of what they’re trying to get across.</p>
<p><span>Though a coterie of name producers were involved here—</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">Chemical Brother</a><span> Tom Rowlands, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5462-james-murphy/"" target=""_blank"">James Murphy</a><span>, and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7723-erol-alkan/"" target=""_blank"">Erol Alkan</a><span>—their contributions are imperceptible here without the credits at hand. </span><span>You could wager a guess by way of the songs' individual tempos and when the rhythms are cranked, </span><i>Love Frequency</i><span> is at least enjoyable in a functional way. And m</span><span>aybe functionality and depersonalization is the endgame. Klaxons aspire for elemental sentiments by using elemental imagery—qualities available to everyone and belonging to nobody, not the least of all Klaxons. </span>The sawtoothed synths on opener “A New Reality” and the curious Earth, Wind &amp; Fire harmonies throughout are brief allusions to the fact that you are listening to a Klaxons album and not any number of E-popping revivalists. Otherwise, there’s barely any trace of Klaxons on <i>Love Frequency</i>, and that's a strange complaint when the best songs here are the ones where the band come closest to disappearing completely, as on instrumental “Liquid Light” and the muted, distant shuffle of “The Dreamers”.  </p>
<p><i>Love Frequency</i> isn’t a complete disaster, if only because the new, chastised, and chaste Klaxons aren’t really capable of doing anything that could inspire that sort of animus. At their best, Klaxons dredge up the kind of sounds that keep the Coachella Sahara Tent bumping all weekend, composed to be aggressive and participatory, yet strangely ambient and easy to ignore. At its worst, it’s the kind of hi-BPM, lo-IQ, alt-electro inanities that are responsible for filling the lineup of <a href=""http://kroq.cbslocal.com/weenieroast2014/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KROQ's Weenie Roast</a> and will make you seriously reconsider your position on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay"">Coldplay</a> and Avicii’s “A Sky Full of Stars”.  For the most part, Klaxons spend most of their time in between, a frequency stuck between stations.</p></div>"|19408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19408-klaxons-love-frequency/|5.1|Ian Cohen

Deykers has since fashioned himself into a bit of a dance music vagabond, moving freely between labels and styles while running his 3024 imprint. He's part of the firmament of underground dance music at this point, something he's accomplished largely by sticking his fingers in a lot of pies. His third full-length, <i>The Air Between Words</i>, finds him on yet another label, Ninja Tune, and continues his move toward big, melodic structures.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Since <i>Great Lengths</i>, fans and critics have gone well out of their way to note how little Deykers has to do with dubstep. They've spent less time defining just what Deykers <i>is</i> making these days, in large part because it's difficult to pin down just where his work settles. His productions are robust and melodic, with table-setter percussion making way for ropey basslines and quivering pads. While nothing here qualifies as an anthem or a banger, Deyker's productions exhibit enviable power and finesse.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In this way Deykers' work is growing closer to the type of sumptuous techno peddled by Detroit legends such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24096-derrick-may/"">Derrick May</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"">Carl Craig</a>, both artists who made big-room tracks for small-room DJs. It's a style that has found more success in Europe than in the United States for decades, which makes Deykers a classicist, if not a nostalgist; certainly, <i>The Air Between Words</i> is his most conventional work.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Deykers will occasionally employ percussive vocal samples, offering up shouts on ""Empty Mind"" and dubby luxury on ""Like That"" (an easy candidate for a single). ""Drones"" slips into the type of insouciant jazz-house <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22117-theo-parrish/"">Theo Parrish</a> popularized; ""Two Leads and a Computer"" is punchy, modern aceeid. A collaboration with outre troubadour <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32295-copeland/"">Copeland</a>, ""Love of Pleasure"", is gently sour, a fine follow up to <i>Great Lengths</i>' vocal triumph, ""These Words"". ""Glassbeadgames"", which finds <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a> adding his usual pinch of beatific prettiness, is more basic.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Deykers has a professional's range and thoroughness, sometimes to the detriment of his albums. <i>The Air Between Words</i> fails to establish a coherent mood, perhaps the single most important task for a dance music album. And while Deykers is no mimic, it's difficult to locate a distinct personality in his work, a problem that also plagued 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15898-martyn-ghost-people/""><i>Ghost People</i></a>. The spark that <i>Great Lengths</i>' friction yielded is missing, and without it, he's just making some tracks. Good tracks, no doubt, but tracks that have failed to establish meaningful context. So it's also difficult not to feel disappointed by <i>The Air Between Words</i>, a solid, conventional effort by an artist who once seemed so vital.</p></div>"|19456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19456-martyn-the-air-between-words/|6.6|Andrew Gaerig

They've been aligned with Baltimore hardcore stronghold A389 since 2011's breakout <i>I Am Not What I Am</i> and have settled comfortably into a niche within the <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">new breed of metallic hardcore that references <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22900-entombed/"">Entombed</a> and Avskum instead of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/435-botch/"">Botch</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a>. The band's newest recording has found a home on Converge frontman Jacob Bannon's Deathwish label, a pairing that makes sense: along with the cover art's sleek black and white design scheme and a fixation on occult imagery, the association cements <span>YAITW’s nebulous status as a band making black metal for hardcore kids.<br/></span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><i>When Life Comes to Death</i> is the band’s fourth album, and it seems like they've finally figured out how to properly wield the cluster of influences they flirt with: Swedish hardcore punk, chunks of spit-shined metallic hardcore, and a few different flavors of black metal. The scarcity of d-beats and overall lack of grime torpedoes the band’s professed allegiance to “blackened crust,” but their crunchy guitar tone and ripper tempos do owe plenty to punk's nastier moments. </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">After the hoarse blackened declaration that is “Betrayed by Light” crashes into earshot, knockout second track “Be My Blood” comes baying in with a hellstorm of clanging metallic punk that probably slays live. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">YAITW have indeed upped their game, especially in terms of incorporating</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> black metal into their sound; what's more, the depressive tendencies of their earlier work have been upgraded to blistering fury. The rollicking grimness of album highlight “Loved and Unwanted” owes plenty to Scandinavian black metal, “Fuck This Life” flaunts the band’s excellent grasp on the genre’s cold, aggressive side, and “Self Inflicted” hinges on murky melodies. The three members clearly know what they’re doing and what they want to accomplish, and it’s not surprising that they each play in more straight-up grindcore and black metal bands on the side. It’s typical of American extreme metal’s proclivity towards intermingling, and that melting pot approach breeds stronger, more interesting results than clinging to orthodoxy yields. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><i>When Life Comes to Death</i> is homogenous as a whole, but its second half throws a few curveballs that go a long way towards livening up this death-obsessed manifesto. “We Are Nothing” is slow and sickly with moments of triumphal melodic intensity, while “Take My Hand” is quiet and desperate as the vocalist begs to be left alone. There’s not much room for weakness or emotion in either hardcore punk or black metal, space that YAITW try to carve out—but it doesn’t always work. The atmospheric, acoustic “Shadow of Murder” aims to be a sombre, haunting affair but ultimately feels like a failed experiment; the clean vocals are stilted, and the timing feels off as riffs bump into one another. It's encouraging to see them explore this kind of sound, but if they’re serious about incorporating such elements into their sound, they’ve got a long way to go. After that, album closer “Embrace Extinction” is a dirgelike hardcore epic, stomping through nearly ten minutes without leaving much of an impression either way.</span></p>
<p><span><span>As solid as the music generally is, much about YAITW feels calculated and contrived, from their slick aesthetic and Watain rip-off logo to the name itself, which pegs them as a swaggering millennial answer to the Dischord bands of old. They’re just a minor threat, no matter how badly they want to be seen as the poster children for evil, crusty black metal.  Their music is interesting, creative, but ultimately safe, a fine introduction to the dark arts that shouldn’t be taken as gospel.</span></span></p></div>"|19370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19370-yaitw-when-life-comes-to-death/|5.5|Kim Kelly

The shifting collective—sometimes a trio, occasionally a duo, and at one point <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51802-death-grips-never-planned-on-actually-appearing-at-their-scheduled-shows/"">consisting of no members at all</a>—have spent the last two years staging a public, low-level coup on people's attention spans that, in terms of subversiveness, has fallen somewhere between egging someone's house and stealing your neighbor's WiFi. Their actions have scanned as humorous, aggressive, contemptible, and puerile—<a href=""http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/nldw-1800.jpeg?wmode=transparent"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sometimes all at once</a>—and despite any high-minded claims, the ends to the means have been excellent promotion for a body of work that's proved increasingly confounding. Their first record, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15583-exmilitary/""><i>Exmilitary</i></a>, remains their most overlooked work even as it represents Death Grips at their most elemental, a potent, nasty mix of blasted rap figures, percussive mania, and corroded noise that smacked of a modern-day <i>Judgment Night</i> soundtrack featuring collaborations beteween <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27689-dalek/"">Dälek</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"">Lightning Bolt</a>.</p>
<p>A year later, Death Grips returned with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16512-death-grips-the-money-store/""><i>The Money Store</i></a>, a dizzying rush of an album with a title that likely referenced the group's short-lived major-label contract with Epic. At the time, band mastermind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6364-zach-hill/"">Zach Hill</a>—a veteran drummer who, after a decade-plus of alternating between the roles of reliable sideman and unsung noise-scene hero, has undoubtedly benefited the most from Death Grips' notoriety—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8815-death-grips/"">claimed</a> that label honcho L.A. Reid air-drummed to the band's music upon signing and compared them to Whitney Houston. The former is a funny image, the latter ostensibly a tasteless joke, but upon engaging with <i>The Money Store,</i> all attendant information becomes irrelevant. A thrilling document of puckered melody and <a href=""http://www.maximumpc.com/files/u69/BSOD_Main.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blue-screen-of-death</a> chaos that stands as the project's strongest release to date, <i>The Money Store</i> resembled the revolting, ultra-violent conclusion to director Nicolas Winding Refn's <i>Pusher</i> films: a dead body hung upside down, its contents drained and shoved into a garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Later that year, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17216-no-love-deep-web/""><i>NO LOVE DEEP WEB</i></a> arrived without warning and free of charge, triggering a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48424-death-grips-post-no-love-deep-web-infringement-letters-from-epic-records-on-facebook/"">well-documented war</a> between Death Grips and their cash-flow overlords. Quite possibly the most dissonant album ever <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9004-death-gripz/"">recorded at the Chateau Marmont</a>, <i>NO LOVE DEEP WEB</i> found Death Grips doubling down on sonic viscera. It's a thick, sludgy record in which the group's wild-eyed mouthpiece Stefan Burnett sounds like he's trapped in hell, dragging himself through a landscape of destruction. Rather than capitalize on the comparatively bright accessibility of <i>The Money Store</i>, it suggested Death Grips were prepared to get weirder. Last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18779-death-grips-government-plates/""><i>Government Plates</i></a> headed even further into left-of-center territory, drawing inspiration from the glitchy terror of IDM's more aggressive elements.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, <i>Government Plates</i> was released suddenly for nothing—and so it goes, too, with <i>Niggas on the Moon</i>, the project's latest missive that arrived last Sunday evening. An eight-track release that stands as Death Grips' shortest effort to date, <i>Niggas on the Moon</i> comes bearing a title that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtBy_ppG4hY&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">possibly references Gil Scott-Heron</a>, along with claims of a high-profile collaborator: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>, who's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpmq4Fi8ic0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">no stranger when it comes to working with inhumanly talented drummers from the noise scene</a>.</p>
<p>But nothing is quite as it seems in Death Grips' world, so within 24 hours of <i>Niggas on the Moon</i>'s release it emerged that rumors of Björk's contributions may have been greatly exaggerated. ""i am proud to announce my vocals landed on the new death grips album !"" she exclaimed in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/bjork/posts/10152444388776460"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an official statement</a> the day after <i>Niggas on the Moon</i> dropped. ""i adore death grips and i am thrilled to be their 'found object' !"" The phrase ""found object"" suggests that she wasn't so much an active artistic partner as much as a passive supplier of source material, another sound thrown into Death Grips' culture-wiping meat grinder. Her presence on the album is, similar to Venus Williams' guttural cries sampled on <i>The Money Store</i> cut ""System Blower"", mangled and distorted beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Whether Björk's presence is the result of Death Grips' sampling her previous work or her providing fresh vocal takes for the band's disposal, Death Grips largely lean on her propensity for ecstatic crescendos. On ""Have a Sad Cum"" and album closer ""Big Dipper"", her cries are looped in perpetuity, producing a hallucinatory effect not unlike the trippy repetition of Chicago footwork; ""Billy Not Really"" opens with a perpetual build anchored by glottal coos, while ""Say Hey Kid"" opens with hyperspeed bass-and-drums a la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3921-squarepusher/"">Squarepusher</a> before twisting Björk's voice into what sounds like panpipes, over a bed of rustling electronics.</p>
<p>Death Grips have remixed Björk before. They contributed takes on ""Sacrifice"" and ""Thunderbolt"", two songs taken from her 2011 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15915-biophilia/"" target=""_blank""><i>Biophilia</i></a>, to 2012's remix collection <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17386-bastards/""><i>Bastards</i></a>; their remix of the former tune is especially notable in that it recycles the march-of-death bassline from ""System Blower"". Similarly, <i>Niggas on the Moon</i> finds Death Grips drawing from themselves rather than pushing things forward, a deviation from their mission statement. Anyone familiar with the band's mix of aggressive electronics, barked non-sequiturs, and collapsing song structures will find plenty to like here. After three years of aiming to confuse and shock, Death Grips are approaching reliability, and the presence of truly thrilling moments has decreased accordingly.</p>
<p>Complacency doesn't suit Death Grips very well, but <i>Niggas on the Moon</i>'s high points suggest regardless that, for now, Death Grips-as-Death Grips occasionally yields satisfying results. Opener ""Up My Sleeves"" is a prime slice of mania that, should the band ever release a ""Greatest Hits"" collection (imagine that), would fit right in with their highest highs. ""Black Quarterback"" possesses a gleeful skip punctuated by inside-out percussion that hits like repeated punches to the abdomen; the processional gait of ""Big Dipper"" sounds like poisoned marching-band music, as Burnett throws out bon mots that highlight Death Grips' still-undervalued sense of humor: ""I'm a bullshitter/ I'm a shitty stripper...I'm a fucking downer.""</p>
<p>As a vocalist and lyricist, Burnett draws strength from his surroundings. When chaos engulfs him, he thrives on the energy; during Death Grips' more downtempo moments, he sounds adrift, his anti-sloganeering coming off as ridiculous and deflated, his audience laughing <i>at</i> rather than <i>with</i> him. <i>Niggas on the Moon</i> is, as a whole, Death Grips' least intense album, which doesn't work in Burnett's favor. Many of the record's songs have midsections that dial down the intensity before revving up again, and while Burnett's phonetic emphasis occasionally pulls him through, elsewhere he sounds listless. Death Grips achieve potency when sounding frantic, untamed, and unstable; <i>Niggas on the Moon</i>'s more subdued moments, comparatively, resemble a brisk walk on a treadmill, and as a result it's less immediate than their previous work.</p>
<p>With the arrival of <i>Niggas on the Moon</i> came the news that the record is part of a forthcoming double-album, <i>The Powers That B</i>, set for release later this year on the band's own label, Third Worlds, as well as Harvest, a subsidiary of major-label entity Capitol. Death Grips are, indeed, <a href=""http://www.harvestrecords.com/artists/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">featured on Harvest's website</a>, so their second flirtation with the music industry's explicitly corporate arena seems to be as structurally legitimate as their first time around—then again, this is a band that prides itself on the capability to catch its audience off guard, so who knows how the rest of the year will play out for them.</p>
<p>With <i>Niggas on the Moon</i>, though, it's hard to shake the feeling that Death Grips might benefit from a change in aesthetic and conceptual focus. Even setting aside the creative stasis the music embodies, the major-label affiliations and surprise-release gimmick produces a stale whiff of deja vu. Without new tricks and fresh aggression, Death Grips risk coming across as safe and ordinary, a mess of broken teeth summarily replaced by a gap-toothed smile.</p></div>"|19472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19472-death-grips-niggas-on-the-moon/|6.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

There's nothing new or particularly notable about smaller artists from independent music partnering with brands from another sphere, but the Barwick/Dogfish meeting feels weird regardless. Her music, built on her ultra-ethereal voice and treated and looped into what can resemble hymns, seems so private and intimate and, for lack of a better word, “pure” (to borrow the title of the first song here). Also, her career seems modest in terms of sales and her profile, so notions of brand synergy are, from one angle, counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the pairing hasn’t altered Barwick’s approach to music. The one concession to the partnership is that elements recorded inside the brewery have been added to the compositions—you can hear some background banging, hissing, and rattling here and there, but small touches like these have been present in Barwick’s music on her last two full-lengths. So unless you get the limited 10"" edition that comes with bottles of Dogfish’s contribution, there’s no real reason to think of this as anything other than a new Julianna Barwick release.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>Rosabi</i> sounds very much like music by Julianna Barwick, which, for fans, is a comforting thought. It doesn’t have the added instrumentation of the last two releases and is comparatively stripped down—an approach that's closer to her earlier, pre-studio work—but the overall effect is identical: gorgeous repeating vocals forming a cozy bed underneath Barwick’s melodic flourishes. Her records are such that individual tracks will jump out at certain people based on a personal memory or association, not because any one song necessarily is “better” than another. The fact that a sound so uniform can move different people in different ways speaks to why Barwick’s work can feel so close—you really do hear it and go into yourself. For me, that highlight is the closing “Blood Brothers”, whose repeating “da-do-da-da” refrain just guts me, even if I can’t quite put a finger on why.</p>
<p>As much as I love letting <i>Rosabi</i> wash over me, it also raises some interesting questions about what happens when an artist continues with an aesthetic they’ve more or less perfected. There’s no real reason to think that Julianna Barwick couldn’t keep making lovely music that sounds something like this for the rest of her life, and there’s also no reason to think I wouldn’t continue to listen to and enjoy each new release in turn. But does that mean that as long as she stays on this path it’s impossible for her to fail? Does that matter? Is “growth” something she can concern herself with, or not, as I continue to enjoy what she comes up with? How will I distinguish between Barwick releases and what will inform my decision to play one instead of another?

Snipes is a sound designer, film composer, and experimental musician who records <span><span>glitchy, snarky</span></span> pop-deconstructionist noise music under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28712-captain-ahab/"">Captain Ahab</a>; he and Hutson are in the noise band Unnecessary Surgery, and co-created the score for the recent documentary <i>Room 237</i>. Initially, clipping. made power electronics-influenced remixes of rap songs, a formula that they stuck fairly close to when they recorded their 2013 debut <i>Midcity</i> after recruiting Diggs to provide original vocals.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Their second album, <i>clppng</i>, opens with a solid minute of the kind of dissonant, legitimately painful high-pitched feedback that sadistic noise guitarists favor, along with some vigorous cypher-style spitting. It’s a clear provocation and a quick primer on the group’s aesthetic aim, which is to deconstruct rap music while staying within the genre's confines—and it’s also a summation of the group’s two major flaws, which are that the tracks go just a little too far in their eagerness to challenge their audience and the raps they’re sharing space with are too banal to make the challenge worth it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Snipes and Hutson are good at coming up with uniquely weird, aggressive sounds. In interviews, they’ve stressed that they begin with a clear idea of how their songs will sound and feel, and that meticulousness is evident on <i>CLPPNG</i>, like on the interplay between a suffocatingly dense bass synth and roomy, bell-like metallic samples on “Work Work”. The duo frequently embrace oddball samples that sound like they were pulled from field recordings; a judiciously edited instrumental version of <i>CLPPNG</i> could make for an interesting contemporary take on musique concrete.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When it comes to turning those sounds into proper rap songs, clipping. falter. There are a few moments where their approach pays off, offering an appealingly mutated version of the more commercial-leaning rap they used as source material in their earlier efforts. “Work Work” resembles a shroomy hallucination of a DJ Mustard beat complete with a verse by Cocc Pistol Cree, who coincidentally appeared on Mustard’s mixtape manifesto from last year, <i>Ketchup</i>. “Tonight,” featuring Gangsta Boo, pairs a two-note synth part that could have been pulled from an Atlanta rap mixtape with a fascinatingly bizarre electronic gurgle that sounds like a synthesizer’s death rattle.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>More often, though, clipping.'s deconstructionist impulses run wild, as the group ignores some of the more crucial elements a rap beat needs. Most of these songs have tediously static arrangements, including “Get Up”, which uses an alarm clock beep as a rhythmic synth lead but fails to build on the conceit; the result sounds like an alarm clock going off for three whole minutes, which isn’t something most people want to hear. Many tracks don’t have proper drum parts, which speaks to the group's tendency to prioritize experimentation over cohesiveness.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's possible that a capable MC might have balanced <i>CLPPNG</i>'s deficiencies, but Diggs is far from capable. His backpacker-y flow sounds shopworn compared to the radically out-there beats, and his lyricism is lacking overall; hip-hop may be a massively self-referential genre, but the fact that nearly every track has at least one reference to an older Top 40 rap song seems like a grab for borrowed interest. Considering clipping.'s left-of-center style, he’s not particularly weird, and the persona that he projects—smart and misanthropic—is muddled at best. Overall,<i> <i>CLPPNG</i></i> is chock full of ideas, and if its failure is due to overambitiousness, well, there are worse ways to fail.<br/></span></p></div>"|19431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19431-clipping-clppng/|5.6|Miles Raymer

Do the same thing over and over, no matter how well, and some will file you away as easily understood, even predictable. This is a bigger hazard when your chosen style itself relies on consistency. Take ambient drone: it’s all about held tones, sounds that change slowly (if at all) and demand patient focus. It’s easy to let ambient drone drift into the background, presumably safe in the assumption that it won’t suprise you.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So it's easy to take an artist like Kyle Bobby Dunn for granted. He’s made music for 12 years, and it’s all been ambient drone. It could be assumed that listening to just one of his albums is all you need to understand his art; he’s even encouraged that assumption by naming one of his stronger albums </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14946-a-young-persons-guide-to-kyle-bobby-dunn/"">A Young Person’s Guide to Kyle Bobby Dunn</a></i><span>. But all of his releases are worthwhile, and even if his consistency isn’t flashy or surprising, it’s rare. He’s continually found new ideas using the same sturdy M.O.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">This doesn’t mean his records are all of equal quality: a few transcend his standard level, pushing his sound up to a singular plane, and </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Kyle Bobby Dunn and the Infinite Sadness </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">is one of those records. There are a lot of reasons why, one of them simple to comprehend: the songs are pretty short. Though the album lasts two hours, most of its 19 tracks hover in the range of five minutes, and only two are longer than ten, which gives the music extra urgency. Often Dunn gets right to the point, setting each piece’s structure quickly and succinctly, rarely messing with extended intros or sitting on a single idea for long. It’s not that his work here is more “song-like” than before—it’s just more focused, more laser-like in the way it hits its marks.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This focus has the added benefit of making the album’s few long pieces more effective. By carefully picking his spots, Dunn earns the right to stretch out when his ideas deserve it. The nine-minute </span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/studentsofdecay/variation-on-a-theme-by-st"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>“Variation on a Theme by St. Dipshit”</span></a><span> (Dunn has a healthy knack for piss-taking titles) feels grand in a subtle, almost humble way, its high-pitched waves unfurling with patience but no stasis. The album’s best piece, the ten-minute “Where Circles Never Become Circles”, offers an elongated crescendo that grows at exactly the right pace; it would sound gratuitous if it reached its heights more rapidly.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Gratuitousness is always a danger with ambient drone; it’s easy, and often tempting, to go for a dramatic chord or a soundtrack-ready swell without the setup needed for a true payoff. But it’s just as easy to hold back and let the music become mechanical and bloodless, more conceptually admirable than emotionally engaging. Dunn knows how to find a range between those two poles, and here never loses sight of that rareified middle ground. Often he gets there through simplicity: take the binary rhythm of “</span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/studentsofdecay/duckfaced-fantasy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Duck-Faced Fantasy</span></a><span>”, the small variances of “</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16270-kyle-bobby-dunn-boring-foothills-of-foot-fetishville/""><span>Boring Foothills of Foot Fetishville</span></a><span>”, or the gradual crest of “On Top of Timeless Hour.” At their best, those tracks suggest moods and images, but also offer open shapes for the listener to fill in.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The fact that Dunn can keep his sound so open after honing it for so long isn't really surprising, but it’s still impresssive. You may know what got him to this point, you may be able to guess what this record sounds like, at least on the surface, and you may even have a line on what he’ll do in the future—but </span><i>Kyle Bobby Dunn &amp; the Infinite Sadness </i><span>is proof that even the most consistent artists can still impress.<br/></span></p></div>"|19379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19379-kyle-bobby-dunn-kyle-bobby-dunn-and-the-infinite-sadness/|7.8|Marc Masters

Vocalist and guitarist Kirk Windstein, the band's only consistent member, has struggled with drinking issues throughout the band's two-decade existence and recently left Down, his longtime project with former Pantera vocalist Phil Anselmo, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32290-eyehategod/"" target=""_blank"">Eyehategod</a>'s Jimmy Bower (who also drummed for Crowbar at one point), and ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23271-corrosion-of-conformity/"" target=""_blank"">Corrosion of Conformity</a> guitarist Pepper Keenan. Despite the internal strife, Crowbar have always managed to sound more straightforward than their peers, and that's still evident in their latest LP, <i>Symmetry in Black</i>. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Their last album, 2011's </span><i>Sever The Wicked Hand</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, found Crowbar warming themselves back up after a six-year recording hiatus, so </span><i>Symmetry</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is the sound of the band back in the saddle. Lead single “Walk With Knowledge Wisely” sums up the essence of Crowbar—chunky sludge riffs, thrash breaks, bluesy leads, and Windstein giving his inner demons room to frolic. The hardcore breakdown at the song's end speaks to Crowbar's influence on modern hardcore groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30511-xibalba/"">Xibalba</a> and Harms Way, and their status as genre forebears shines through via </span><i>Symmetry</i>'s<span style=""font-style: normal;""> crunchy production</span><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">“Reflection of Deceit” is an improvement on </span><i>Wicked</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s “Let Me Mourn”—the opening riff is more grandiose, the production breathes life into the song, and Windstein sounds even more mournful than before. His voice sounds older than it does on Crowbar's earlier records; given the band's themes and sounds, this works in their favor. He achieves what radio-rock bands can't do—that is, incorporate clean vocals without coming off as over-dramatic.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"">Even for an album that's a chronicle of personal trials, <i>Black</i> ends on a particularly bleak note with “The Piety of Self-Loathing,” an instrumental track that's reminiscent of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKAu1kPduyE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Nothing”</a>, a song from 1996's <i>Broken Glass</i> that still stands as one of the most depressing songs Crowbar's ever made.

Some of the artists that were once universally appreciated are slipping from memory, while others are having difficulty translating to new generations. The furor greeting each new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a> enterprise shows their music and image are indeed proving timeless, and they remain relevant for teenagers and septuagenarians alike—but other giants from the late 1960s and early 70s aren’t having it so easy. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4592-the-who/"">The Who</a>’s stock has plummeted in the last decade, and it’s getting tougher to find anyone under 35 who cares about a note of their music made after 1971. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">The Rolling Stones</a> have been at it so long that it’s difficult for younger people to believe that they were once actually good. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> still reach some alienated kids, but their most devoted fans are among the graybeard audiophile set. And then there's Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>Zeppelin occupies a unique place among this group of bands, in part because their position was hard to pin down while they were active. They were unimaginably popular from 1969 to 1980, but critical respect was elusive. Their suspect reputation has been somewhat overstated (in the U.S., <i>Rolling Stone</i> panned them early on but eventually came around, while <i>Creem</i> and <i>Circus</i> took them seriously all along) but Led Zeppelin never quite registered with the intelligentsia. They made the heaviest hard rock records ever recorded, but their lyrics tended toward loopy mysticism when they weren’t either stealing ideas outright or wallowing in a kind of hedonism where misogyny was a given.</p>
<p>In 2014, Led Zeppelin is typically viewed through one of three lenses: those among the 50-plus set who were actually there hear their music with a nostalgic ear, remembering the days of their youth. There are those who grew up with the assumption that Led Zeppelin were important—let's say 30 to 50 years old—hear them filtered through a second wave of nostalgia, from movie titles like <i>Dazed and Confused</i> and the memory of classic rock radio. To these people (including me), Zeppelin defined an otherworldly image of '70s rock deities, conquering the world on the strength of volume, arena shows, and the baddest riffs the world had ever heard. And then there’s the younger set for whom Zep might seem a little comical, a faintly embarrassing relic from another era even as a certain amount of the music remains undeniable. In one sense, this latter group have more in common with the skeptical critics of the first wave, possessing expectations of ""what music should be"" that don’t necessarily apply for a band that sounds like <i>this</i>.</p>
<p>These reissues of Zeppelin’s first three albums are an attempt to reach all of these people, using every tool at the band and label’s disposal. The primary reason these sets are being presented and received as a Big Deal is that they are the first reissues of the digital era (and here I’m using the term to include CDs, which means we’re going back more than 30 years) to include bonus material. The reissues are remastered and are packaged with bonus discs that include previously unreleased live material and studio cuts. The PR push surrounding a big reissue in 2014 inevitably involves sharing things that can spread on social media and hence reach younger kids, while other elements—unheard versions, improved sound—ostensibly entice older fans to re-buy the records.</p>
<p>Jimmy Page, always Led Zeppelin’s sonic architect, heard the blues differently. He heard it as sound first, rather than a form or tradition or product of personalities—maybe that’s why he felt so cavalier about ""borrowing"" from blues records without attribution, since you can't copyright a sound—and he understood the trance-inducing element of blues repetition better than anyone: blues as a consciousness-expanding ritual. All of this is clear from the very beginning, as <i>Led Zeppelin</i> is one of music's most assured and fully realized debuts; individually, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham were great players, but the whole of their sound somehow exceeded the sum of its parts. But even above the instrumental virtuosity, <i>Led Zeppelin</i> is a triumph of production, each part clear and forceful but adding up to something even more powerful.</p>
<p>Just about everything Zep would do at one point is presented here somewhere—trance-rock (“Dazed and Confused”), gorgeous acoustic folk (“Black Mountain Side”), catchy guitar pop (“Good Times Bad Times”), updates on straight blues (“I Can’t Quit You Baby”). They’d do most of these things <i>better</i> later, but this is where they appeared first. Zep sounded so brilliant right out of the gate because Page was already a veteran of the music scene when they started; working as a session guitarist and later with the Yardbirds, he took in the scene and saw what was missing. As much as Zeppelin understood music, at this point words were more or less just sounds.</p>
<p><i>Led Zeppelin</i> also set the tone for a decade of dippy lyrics. If Zep was never accepted as hip in some circles, it’s partly because of the knuckle-dragging worldview of songs like “Dazed and Confused”. It’s hard not to laugh or cringe in 2014 when hearing a line like “Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard-earned pay/ Try and love you baby but you push me away,” but it’s equally difficult not to acknowledge that Robert Plant delivers them with a certain histrionic power. And then a bar later, John Bonham’s slow fills and Page’s terrifying guitar screech come in, and the true meaning of the music is found.</p>
<p>It’s truly impossible to oversell how brilliantly these records are produced; “rock” as an idea is really a ’70s idea, and Led Zeppelin established what that would mean and what it would sound like, which was as much a matter of arrangement as it was knowing where to set the microphones, how high to mix the bass. You can hear that on the bonus disc to the first album, which was recorded live in Paris in 1969 and aired on radio. The recording fidelity, for a release by such a major band, is remarkably poor—which goes to show how well the vaults have already been cleared out—but there’s no doubting just how much this band could rip in their first year. Of particular note is the attack of Plant’s singing, as he comes over like the unhinged 22-year-old he was. The earliest live recordings by bands are so exciting in large part because the vocalist hasn’t yet learned how to pace himself; Plant sings these songs like Zeppelin might last a year and this is his one chance to get it right. By the late ’70s, purely as a matter of survival, he’d learn how to coast on stage.</p>
<p>There is no arguing with a riff. It’s a conversation-ender, something resistant to analysis that strips away the intellectual to situate the music in a purely physical space. Of the 100 greatest guitar riffs in the history of rock music, Jimmy Page might have written 20, and a good number of those can be found on Led Zeppelin’s second album from 1969. If you or someone close to you has ever been within 10 feet of a radio tuned to a classic rock station, you’ve heard them all, many times—maybe too many. For every young person who discovers “Whole Lotta Love” and “Heartbreaker” and “Living Loving Maid (She’s Just a Woman)”, there’s an older person who gets sick of them from overplay and doesn’t need to ever hear them again. Part of the challenge and excitement of revisiting a record upon reissue is trying to hear the music again with fresh ears, seeing if you can tap into that feeling of discovery that came from hearing it the first time. When I’m able to mentally put myself into this place— the kid who got his driver’s license a month ago, driving around listening to <i>II</i> on tape—the reissue sounds as thrilling as ever.</p>
<p>Every track on this record is musically brilliant, and in the span of just a few months it’s amazing how much Page had enriched the band’s sound. Chiming acoustic guitars provide the contrast to the crunch in a whole new way on “Ramble On” and “Thank You”, offering yet another template for mixing folk with proto-metal. “Whole Lotta Love” might have gotten the band sued by Willie Dixon, but there was no sonic precedent for it in rock music—it’s a sound that would have been unimaginable without the rise of drug culture. If you are not a drummer, it’s hard to imagine listening to “Moby Dick” very often, but better evidence of John Bonham’s genius is found elsewhere on the record. Zep’s rhythmic underpinning, especially the locked-in tandem of Jones and Bonham, was always their secret weapon, the thing that divided them from contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a>. They could swing, they loved <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a> and Motown, and they took pride in the fact that people would dance at their shows. The bonus disc is a mildly interesting amalgam of alternate mixes and rough takes—the kind of stuff anyone but the most dedicated obsessives will listen to only once—and there’s little advance here lyrically from the debut, but <i>II</i> is still close to perfect.</p>
<p><i>III</i> is, indirectly, Led Zeppelin’s own version of Pink Floyd's <i>Meddle</i>—the folky, pretty early record that was never too popular and hence a favorite of indie types skeptical of such a massive mainstream band. That it opens with “Immigrant Song”, one of their top few rockers, only makes the later acoustic loveliness that much more affecting. The strings laid atop the acoustic guitar on “Friends” foreshadow “Kashmir”; “Tangerine” has an amazing tension between the minor-key verses and the open, joyous chorus, as good an example of any of Zep as a pop band. The melancholy ache of “That’s the Way” is Zep with their guard down—it goes down as easy as a great Cat Stevens song—and then by the end of the record things start to get a little weird, with the heavy acoustic hoedown of “Bron-Y-Aur Stomp” and the acid-fried chug of the blues standard “Shake ’em on Down”, a nod to the hypnotic one-chord version by Mississippi Fred McDowell. <i>III</i> has easily the best bonus material too, including a fantastic unreleased version of the old blues song “Keys to the Highway”. Depending on your age, you might remember <i>III</i> as “the one with the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApxnAr6pRt0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Viking kittens</a> song” or “the one with that pretty song that played during an<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dFz8Hpb7vY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> interlude of <i>Almost Famous</i></a>”; for someone who doesn’t necessarily want to be inundated with songs and riffs that became clichés, it might be the best place to start.</p>
<p>For some, the interest in these sets is the remastering, an alleged improvement in sound, which makes sense for a band so song-oriented. I’ve always thought that Zeppelin, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>, were best heard from nice-sounding pressings from the ’70s that were utterly ubiquitous in used LP bins in the ’80s and ’90s. Back then, you could collect the entire Zeppelin catalog for something like $30, where the inferior sounding early CD masters would run you more like $150.</p>
<p>These days the gap between different versions seems to be closing. I attended a listening session for these reissues in New York, hosted by Jimmy Page, and at one point he was asked which version sounded best, vinyl or CD. Page responded with saying the best version was the original analog tape, but “unfortunately I can’t invite you all ’round to listen to it.” Suffice to say that these remasters sound very good, a bit louder but not overly so, but we’re likely reaching a point of diminishing returns. That said, I’m very glad these new remasters and the attendant publicity push exist, to get us all listening to and talking about Led Zeppelin again, where they stand and what they might mean. However you feel about them and their brand of ultra-huge arena rock, there has never been another band like them, before or since.</p></div>"|19418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19418-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-ii-led-zeppelin-iii/|9.2|Mark Richardson

In one sense, this latter group have more in common with the skeptical critics of the first wave, possessing expectations of ""what music should be"" that don’t necessarily apply for a band that sounds like <i>this</i>.</p>
<p>These reissues of Zeppelin’s first three albums are an attempt to reach all of these people, using every tool at the band and label’s disposal. The primary reason these sets are being presented and received as a Big Deal is that they are the first reissues of the digital era (and here I’m using the term to include CDs, which means we’re going back more than 30 years) to include bonus material. The reissues are remastered and are packaged with bonus discs that include previously unreleased live material and studio cuts. The PR push surrounding a big reissue in 2014 inevitably involves sharing things that can spread on social media and hence reach younger kids, while other elements—unheard versions, improved sound—ostensibly entice older fans to re-buy the records.</p>
<p>Jimmy Page, always Led Zeppelin’s sonic architect, heard the blues differently. He heard it as sound first, rather than a form or tradition or product of personalities—maybe that’s why he felt so cavalier about ""borrowing"" from blues records without attribution, since you can't copyright a sound—and he understood the trance-inducing element of blues repetition better than anyone: blues as a consciousness-expanding ritual. All of this is clear from the very beginning, as <i>Led Zeppelin</i> is one of music's most assured and fully realized debuts; individually, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham were great players, but the whole of their sound somehow exceeded the sum of its parts. But even above the instrumental virtuosity, <i>Led Zeppelin</i> is a triumph of production, each part clear and forceful but adding up to something even more powerful.</p>
<p>Just about everything Zep would do at one point is presented here somewhere—trance-rock (“Dazed and Confused”), gorgeous acoustic folk (“Black Mountain Side”), catchy guitar pop (“Good Times Bad Times”), updates on straight blues (“I Can’t Quit You Baby”). They’d do most of these things <i>better</i> later, but this is where they appeared first. Zep sounded so brilliant right out of the gate because Page was already a veteran of the music scene when they started; working as a session guitarist and later with the Yardbirds, he took in the scene and saw what was missing. As much as Zeppelin understood music, at this point words were more or less just sounds.</p>
<p><i>Led Zeppelin</i> also set the tone for a decade of dippy lyrics. If Zep was never accepted as hip in some circles, it’s partly because of the knuckle-dragging worldview of songs like “Dazed and Confused”. It’s hard not to laugh or cringe in 2014 when hearing a line like “Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard-earned pay/ Try and love you baby but you push me away,” but it’s equally difficult not to acknowledge that Robert Plant delivers them with a certain histrionic power. And then a bar later, John Bonham’s slow fills and Page’s terrifying guitar screech come in, and the true meaning of the music is found.</p>
<p>It’s truly impossible to oversell how brilliantly these records are produced; “rock” as an idea is really a ’70s idea, and Led Zeppelin established what that would mean and what it would sound like, which was as much a matter of arrangement as it was knowing where to set the microphones, how high to mix the bass. You can hear that on the bonus disc to the first album, which was recorded live in Paris in 1969 and aired on radio. The recording fidelity, for a release by such a major band, is remarkably poor—which goes to show how well the vaults have already been cleared out—but there’s no doubting just how much this band could rip in their first year. Of particular note is the attack of Plant’s singing, as he comes over like the unhinged 22-year-old he was. The earliest live recordings by bands are so exciting in large part because the vocalist hasn’t yet learned how to pace himself; Plant sings these songs like Zeppelin might last a year and this is his one chance to get it right. By the late ’70s, purely as a matter of survival, he’d learn how to coast on stage.</p>
<p>There is no arguing with a riff. It’s a conversation-ender, something resistant to analysis that strips away the intellectual to situate the music in a purely physical space. Of the 100 greatest guitar riffs in the history of rock music, Jimmy Page might have written 20, and a good number of those can be found on Led Zeppelin’s second album from 1969. If you or someone close to you has ever been within 10 feet of a radio tuned to a classic rock station, you’ve heard them all, many times—maybe too many. For every young person who discovers “Whole Lotta Love” and “Heartbreaker” and “Living Loving Maid (She’s Just a Woman)”, there’s an older person who gets sick of them from overplay and doesn’t need to ever hear them again. Part of the challenge and excitement of revisiting a record upon reissue is trying to hear the music again with fresh ears, seeing if you can tap into that feeling of discovery that came from hearing it the first time. When I’m able to mentally put myself into this place— the kid who got his driver’s license a month ago, driving around listening to <i>II</i> on tape—the reissue sounds as thrilling as ever.</p>
<p>Every track on this record is musically brilliant, and in the span of just a few months it’s amazing how much Page had enriched the band’s sound. Chiming acoustic guitars provide the contrast to the crunch in a whole new way on “Ramble On” and “Thank You”, offering yet another template for mixing folk with proto-metal. “Whole Lotta Love” might have gotten the band sued by Willie Dixon, but there was no sonic precedent for it in rock music—it’s a sound that would have been unimaginable without the rise of drug culture. If you are not a drummer, it’s hard to imagine listening to “Moby Dick” very often, but better evidence of John Bonham’s genius is found elsewhere on the record. Zep’s rhythmic underpinning, especially the locked-in tandem of Jones and Bonham, was always their secret weapon, the thing that divided them from contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a>. They could swing, they loved <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a> and Motown, and they took pride in the fact that people would dance at their shows. The bonus disc is a mildly interesting amalgam of alternate mixes and rough takes—the kind of stuff anyone but the most dedicated obsessives will listen to only once—and there’s little advance here lyrically from the debut, but <i>II</i> is still close to perfect.</p>
<p><i>III</i> is, indirectly, Led Zeppelin’s own version of Pink Floyd's <i>Meddle</i>—the folky, pretty early record that was never too popular and hence a favorite of indie types skeptical of such a massive mainstream band. That it opens with “Immigrant Song”, one of their top few rockers, only makes the later acoustic loveliness that much more affecting. The strings laid atop the acoustic guitar on “Friends” foreshadow “Kashmir”; “Tangerine” has an amazing tension between the minor-key verses and the open, joyous chorus, as good an example of any of Zep as a pop band. The melancholy ache of “That’s the Way” is Zep with their guard down—it goes down as easy as a great Cat Stevens song—and then by the end of the record things start to get a little weird, with the heavy acoustic hoedown of “Bron-Y-Aur Stomp” and the acid-fried chug of the blues standard “Shake ’em on Down”, a nod to the hypnotic one-chord version by Mississippi Fred McDowell. <i>III</i> has easily the best bonus material too, including a fantastic unreleased version of the old blues song “Keys to the Highway”. Depending on your age, you might remember <i>III</i> as “the one with the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApxnAr6pRt0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Viking kittens</a> song” or “the one with that pretty song that played during an<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dFz8Hpb7vY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> interlude of <i>Almost Famous</i></a>”; for someone who doesn’t necessarily want to be inundated with songs and riffs that became clichés, it might be the best place to start.</p>
<p>For some, the interest in these sets is the remastering, an alleged improvement in sound, which makes sense for a band so song-oriented. I’ve always thought that Zeppelin, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>, were best heard from nice-sounding pressings from the ’70s that were utterly ubiquitous in used LP bins in the ’80s and ’90s. Back then, you could collect the entire Zeppelin catalog for something like $30, where the inferior sounding early CD masters would run you more like $150.</p>
<p>These days the gap between different versions seems to be closing. I attended a listening session for these reissues in New York, hosted by Jimmy Page, and at one point he was asked which version sounded best, vinyl or CD. Page responded with saying the best version was the original analog tape, but “unfortunately I can’t invite you all ’round to listen to it.” Suffice to say that these remasters sound very good, a bit louder but not overly so, but we’re likely reaching a point of diminishing returns. That said, I’m very glad these new remasters and the attendant publicity push exist, to get us all listening to and talking about Led Zeppelin again, where they stand and what they might mean. However you feel about them and their brand of ultra-huge arena rock, there has never been another band like them, before or since.</p></div>"|19418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19418-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-ii-led-zeppelin-iii/|10.0|Mark Richardson

Some of the artists that were once universally appreciated are slipping from memory, while others are having difficulty translating to new generations. The furor greeting each new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a> enterprise shows their music and image are indeed proving timeless, and they remain relevant for teenagers and septuagenarians alike—but other giants from the late 1960s and early 70s aren’t having it so easy. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4592-the-who/"">The Who</a>’s stock has plummeted in the last decade, and it’s getting tougher to find anyone under 35 who cares about a note of their music made after 1971. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">The Rolling Stones</a> have been at it so long that it’s difficult for younger people to believe that they were once actually good. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> still reach some alienated kids, but their most devoted fans are among the graybeard audiophile set. And then there's Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>Zeppelin occupies a unique place among this group of bands, in part because their position was hard to pin down while they were active. They were unimaginably popular from 1969 to 1980, but critical respect was elusive. Their suspect reputation has been somewhat overstated (in the U.S., <i>Rolling Stone</i> panned them early on but eventually came around, while <i>Creem</i> and <i>Circus</i> took them seriously all along) but Led Zeppelin never quite registered with the intelligentsia. They made the heaviest hard rock records ever recorded, but their lyrics tended toward loopy mysticism when they weren’t either stealing ideas outright or wallowing in a kind of hedonism where misogyny was a given.</p>
<p>In 2014, Led Zeppelin is typically viewed through one of three lenses: those among the 50-plus set who were actually there hear their music with a nostalgic ear, remembering the days of their youth. There are those who grew up with the assumption that Led Zeppelin were important—let's say 30 to 50 years old—hear them filtered through a second wave of nostalgia, from movie titles like <i>Dazed and Confused</i> and the memory of classic rock radio. To these people (including me), Zeppelin defined an otherworldly image of '70s rock deities, conquering the world on the strength of volume, arena shows, and the baddest riffs the world had ever heard. And then there’s the younger set for whom Zep might seem a little comical, a faintly embarrassing relic from another era even as a certain amount of the music remains undeniable.

Two roads diverged in the woods and most people could give a shit. When sisters Johanna and Klara Söderberg named both a song and their third album together as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29087-first-aid-kit/"">First Aid Kit</a> after Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay”, from his Pulitzer-winning 1923 collection <i>New Hampshire</i>, the choice seemed to reflect their youth: The sisters signed their first record contract in 2008 when Johanna was 17 and Klara 14, both around the age when most readers have Frost thrust upon them. On the other hand, the Söderbergs are Swedish, not American. And instead of stopping by woods on a snowy evening, they’ve chosen Frost’s elegy to the natural state of entropy. “Nature’s first green is gold, her hardest hue to hold,” he writes. “So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay.”</p>
<p>It’s a darker and more fatalistic sentiment than we typically expect from Frost, a sunny reminder than nothing continues in its ideal state. Everything fades. We all die. First Aid Kit understand this inevitability, yet they have the tenacity and optimism to fight against that falling apart. “What if our hard work ends in despair?” the sisters ask on “Stay Gold”, as a guitar plucks out a stoic theme and the percussion echoes against canyon walls. “What if the road won’t take me there?” They’re not jaded—at least not yet. The Söderbergs remain romantics in an unromantic world, not only writing lyrics about fighting the good fight but making the kind of wide-eyed, ‘70s-tinged folk-rock that thrives on soaring vocals, warm harmonies, big choruses, and heart-on-sleeve lyrics.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of each on <i>Stay Gold</i>, their first record for Columbia. It’s certainly their grandest and arguably their most consistent release to date, even if there’s nothing here as undeniable as “Emmylou”,  from 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16205-the-lions-roar/"">The Lion’s Roar</a></i>. With its affectionate hook, that song was both a paean to country music romance and a mission statement; ostensibly the lyrics were directed toward a male counterpart, but it sounded more like the sisters were inviting each other to sing along. <i>Stay Gold</i> similarly conveys the joys of musical collaboration—their voices always sound good together—yet they’re not quite so convinced of the merits of the music industry. These are weary songs about transience: touring constantly, missing home, losing friends and lovers. It’s darker than <i>Roar</i>, but also wiser, more mature in its conflicts. First Aid Kit still can’t sell a line like, “Shit gets fucked up and people just disappear,” but they convey the dusty self-assertion of “The Bell” like it’s gospel.</p>
<p>“I’d rather be moving than static,” they sing together on a song called “Shattered and Hollow”, before promising each other, “We are gonna get out of here.” Touring life is a tricky theme for any artist to address, as it potentially alienates an audience that has never hired a booking agent, never had to worry about label contracts, and never had to deal with prying journalists. What’s bracing about <i>Stay Gold</i>, then, is how universal the Söderberg sisters make that life sound. Rather than dwell on the particulars of long days on the road, they pare their experiences down to sentiments that sound more relatable and identifiable, whether it’s leaving home, discovering new places, or defining your own destiny before the gold fades. In a sense, First Aid Kit have managed to establish a touring diary as a metaphor for young womanhood, which makes the music more powerful. “Girls they just want to have fun,” they sing on “Waitress Song”, “and the rest of us hardly know who we are.” The song gallops at a dramatic pace, with that insistent acoustic guitar and ornate filigrees of pedal steel instilling the chorus with a sense of immense yearning.</p>
<p>To record <i>Stay Gold</i>, the Söderberg sisters again flew to Omaha to work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27943-mike-mogis/"">Mike Mogis</a>, who produced <i>The Lion’s Roar. </i>Naturally, the folk-rock reference points remain, even if the duo paint with a broader palette. There’s more color here, like the sympathetic flute on “Fleeting One” and the hoedown momentum of “Heaven Knows”. Mogis’ production sounds shinier, however, more elaborate and dense, with a vague shimmer pervading every note. While it broadcasts a kind of coming-of-age melodrama, this fuller, more self-consciously produced sound undercuts the immediacy of the sisters’ songwriting, such that songs like ""Cedar Lane"" and ""The Bell"" seem to be less about working through thorny issues and more about recalling confusions tucked away safely in the past. The music threatens to rob them of their youth, but these two women have the poise and presence to sing like they're still in the yellow woods pondering which path they should take. </p></div>"|19342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19342-first-aid-kit-stay-gold/|7.3|Stephen M.

Schlarb’s music has a pensive, numinous feel, emphasizing fine-grained and muted, sparkling textures. He assembles large ensembles and lets the music come out of the configuration of personalities, and this humble collective approach is probably why Schlarb remains overlooked; to date, his greatest moment of recognition was for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2JaCBnEzsM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a cover of the Beach Boys’ “Til I Die”</a> with Stevens, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/923-castanets/"">Castanets</a>' Ray Raposa and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8670-cryptacize/"">Cryptacize</a>'s Nedelle Torrisi. The solid but low-key <i>Making the Saint</i> probably won’t elevate Schlarb's profile, but it's definitely a standout release in his catalog.</p>
<p>This time around, he's taken a solo approach to making music, giving a rare glimpse of his unfiltered sensibility. In a gap between ensemble tours, he found himself in a cabin in the San Bernardino mountains and spent a few days recording these structured improvisations for guitars and electronics. “I love small records,” he writes of the record, citing Fripp &amp; Eno’s <i>No Pussyfooting</i> as one. Schlarb’s idea of “small” is surprisingly large: for <i>Making the Saint</i>, he produced two very long tracks of monumental proportions centered on the electric guitar, and two short ones for acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>The debt to Fripp &amp; Eno is evident on the patient 19-minute title track, which evokes a guitar solo unfolding on some grander, slower, more liquid order of time. Two electronic waves—one deep, one a flickering overtone—have the black, silky sound of woodwinds, coiling for more than a minute before a slightly dirty electric guitar appears. The entire piece is less of an arc than a series of linked plateaus that gently rise and fall, carrying us through harmonically related passages of bedraggled rock, desert blues, and ruminative involutions woven through the implacable backing track.  </p>
<p>Though Schlarb manages the long game skillfully on “Making the Saint”, the other epic, “The Fear of Death is the Birth of God”, is more active, transformative, and diverse in timbre. Heavy, dark hues replace the title track’s slow-motion fireworks, building around the lattice of a guitar figure that climbs down through the tape hiss like a ladder leading into a tomb. The various elements—a screaming cello-like tone that has the scoured metallic ring of a singing bowl, crumbling strums that trail silt, gong-like washes, electronic bends and wobbles—widely revolve around and deeply interpenetrate each other, creating a feel that is ancient and mystic at times, nearly symphonic at others.     </p>
<p>The two short acoustic pieces are sequenced, respectively, as a cleansing oasis and a brief coda. The outro is a perfectly pleasant instrumental version of “My Foolish Heart”, a popular song from the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, while the Bibio-like “Great Receiver” is the only time the record falls flat. A crying and squeaking electric guitar solo briefly wakes up an otherwise sleepy track burdened by Schlarb’s tentative, toneless singing. But a bum three minutes among nearly 40 compelling ones isn’t bad. <i>Making the Saint</i> is a refined yet minor record that works as an intimate aperture into the subtle wonders of Schlarb’s catalog.</p></div>"|19422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19422-chris-schlarb-making-the-saint/|6.3|Brian Howe

The same can be said for the progression from the rudimentary rage of pioneers like <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BiohazardDFL"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Biohazard</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31337-integrity/"" target=""_blank"">Integrity</a>, as well as the acrid genius of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"" target=""_blank"">Converge</a>’s 2001 magnum opus, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1594-jane-doe/"" target=""_blank"">Jane Doe</a></i>, an album that, over a decade later, remains the genre’s greatest achievement. Conversely, the rise of <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/metalcore-breakdown-composer/id856096086?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">metalcore breakdown composer apps</a> seemed to come out of nowhere, turning what was once a rapidly-evolving crossover scene into a perennial punching bag for fans of heavy music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As metalcore struggles to reassert itself in the wake of some <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLYoJgbybes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unforgiveable disasters</a>, it’s clear that the genre needs a new champion. Enter<span> </span><a href=""http://enablerband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Enabler</a>, a young Milwaukee trio formed from the ashes of local hardcore groups Harlots and Abbadon. Their 2012 debut LP, <i>All Hail the Void</i>, quickly established themselves as potential saviors, eyebrow-raises over their original drummer (Fall Out Boy’s Andy Hurley) be damned. Now, two years and more than a few lineup changes later, they’re back with <i>La Fin Absolue Du Monde</i>, a fierce follow-up that imbues what many consider to be a dying art form with a fresh, if still developing, sense of purpose.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In-demand noisecore producer Steve Austin, best known for his work with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/todayisthedayofficial"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Today is the Day</a>, manned the boards for the <i>La Fin Absolue</i>, and his mix borders on self-cannibalizing. Fanged, full-bodied guitars hog most of the space, locked in a constant struggle for space with the hollow blast-beats of drummer Ryan Steigerwald’s kit. Even with their propensity for earworm riffs and slower tempos, the Milwaukee trio is plenty rabid, so when these two artists team up, they strike a fierce balance between catchy and crusty.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Opener “Close My Eyes” showcases the strength of such an approach, its pulverizing blows softened by hummable guitar hooks and scream-along choruses plucked from hardcore’s halcyon days. The resulting palette suggests <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/earthcrisisofficial"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Earth Crisis</a> by way of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8128-coliseum/"" target=""_blank"">Coliseum</a>, or alternately, an accessible take on the gravelly punk pushed by contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30079-trap-them/"" target=""_blank"">Trap Them</a>. It’s metalcore, all right—but between the d-beat instrumentation, swampy sounding licks, and the odd droning passage, you’d be hard pressed to find these guys on the Warped Tour circuit even <i>with </i>the melodic boost (not that they'd want to play a fest like that—in a 2012 interview, frontman/chief songwriter Jeff Lohrber referred to the vast majority of metalcore acts as being <a href=""%E2%80%9CEverything%20that%E2%80%99s%20popular%20these%20days%20is%20void%20of%20guitar%20riffs,%20void%20of%20soul.%20It%20annoys%20the%20living%20piss%20out%20of%20me%20and%20I%20feel%20like%20I%20have%20to%20do%20something%20about%20that.%E2%80%9D%20%20%20Read%20More:%20Enabler%20Vocalist%20Jeff%20Lohrber%20Hates%20Modern%20Metalcore%20With%20a%20Passion%20%7C%20http://noisecreep.com/enabler-all-hail-the-void/?trackback=tsmclip"" target=""_blank"">""as dispensable as hair bands in the '80s""</a>).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The title of Enabler's LP is derived from the French for “the absolute end of the world”, so we’re talking eschatology to the extreme here: not just hellfire and asteroid impacts, but rampant corruption, greed, and a complete lack of justice for the dispossessed (see “Sickened By the Wake”, its funerary traits sublimated into tools for protest). Then again, the band’s willing to bet that we were dead to begin with; partway through “I’ve Got a Bad Feeling About This”, Lohrber barks, <span>”No future, no fate/ There's nothing but the lies we make,""</span> a strangely sticky chorus that doubles as the album’s overarching mantra.  Such a mentality necessitates batshit instrumentation, and </span><i>La Fin Absolue </i><span>delivers, from “Linear Existence”’s cascade of sludge to the war waged by “New Life”s dueling guitar lines.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>After such apocalyptic fury, it’s only right to expect a skull-crushing finale—but closer “Consequence” proves the album’s biggest disappointment. Fatigued, directionless, and in dire need of an editor, its mangled grooves get hijacked halfway through by one of the blandest stoner jams of recent memory, the final minute consisting of a strange decrescendo-crescendo that makes no attempt to hide its laziness. Enabler's world thus ends not with a bang, but with a sigh—a real shame, considering that the album is otherwise successful in its attempts to build up cathartic energy. Chances are, humanity (and metalcore) will still be doomed when time Enabler decides to churn out a follow-up, granting them the chance to accompany us into the abyss once more.</span></p></div>"|19378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19378-enabler-la-fin-absolute-du-monde/|7.0|Zoe Camp

The odds of a videotape of a concert by a brutally obscure band surviving in playable condition for three decades are slim, an official reissue of the contents of the videotape even slimmer. But we’re living in a golden age of reissues, where there’s seemingly nothing—from vintage self-released New Age records to compilations of rock bands who sang about Dungeons &amp; Dragons—that’s too arcane for a repress. The bigger surprise, then, is that an audio rip of a 30-year-old VHS tape of a performance by a punk-funk band playing at a hippie craft-and-food market in Eugene, Oregon it not only deserves to be listened to, but nearly demands it. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Stick Against Stone have long been one of the missing pieces in the history of the American punk avant-garde; founded in Pittsburgh in 1981, the group combined a wide-ranging collection of influences (free jazz, ska, Afrofunk, hardcore) with an intensively revolution-minded political spirit that infused every facet of the band, down to its collective organization as a functionally anarchistic “leaderless collective”. They were essentially an American version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11831-crass/"">Crass</a>, with a utopian vision that revolved around dancing.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>The Oregon Bootleg Tapes</i> were recorded in 1985, when the group had relocated to Eugene after a stint in Brooklyn, where they had shared a practice space with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/275-bad-brains/"">Bad Brains</a>. The group’s earlier material, which you can hear on the 2010 reissue <i>The Index of Directions</i>, had a taut, anxious energy that it shared with New York City's No Wave scene and a few UK post-punk bands. By the time they got settled in Oregon, they’d acquired a confident looseness that translated into smoother, deeper grooves that set them apart from their contemporaries, who often put air quotes around their funkier influences.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“The Hopping Frog” is the strongest example of Stick Against Stone's jittery take on ska that they return to several times throughout the set. It’s also a showcase for front woman Sari Morninghawk’s talents as both a vocalist and a percussionist with a frenetic, focused style, as well as saxophonist Robert “Xeres” Shepard’s ability to replicate the presence of an entire horn section on his own. They both add idiosyncratic wrinkles to the group’s sound, and they also distinguish themselves by the amount of stylistic ground that they cover. In between the amped up ska-funk numbers, they experiment with reggae, blissed-out New Wave pop, and, on the track “Rhetoric”, a hard-edged, angular, and thoroughly unique funk shot through with the unpredictable energy of classic, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"">Ornette Coleman</a>-style free jazz.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In a market flooded with reissues, what sets the truly great ones apart are moments of eerie prescience where a particular sound pops up years before it was due. “Rhetoric” predicts where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1378-the-ex/"">the Ex</a> would end up ten years later, and even more startling is “Instant,” a disco track flecked with bits of reggae and played with a blunted, loose-limbed energy that predated the likes of !!! and LCD Soundsystem. Politically, Stick Against Stone was very much of of its moment, with songs about Leonard Peltier, El Salvador, punk scene politics, and hippie juice bars. They had their eyes on the there and then, but they were playing 20 years into the future.</span></p></div>"|19364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19364-stick-against-stone-the-oregon-bootleg-tapes/|7.3|Miles Raymer

On the Bay Area quartet’s 2012 LP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16992-long-slow-dance/"">Long Slow Dance</a></i>, it swapped lo-fi gristle for nu-romantic vibes, pairing up singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29099-tim-cohen/"">Tim Cohen</a>’s surreal but self-conscious lyrics with shimmering, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"">Smiths</a>-like guitar riffs. But if you expected jangle-pop ebullience while approaching “Bells of Paonia,” the first single from the band’s fifth full-length, <i>House of Spirits</i>, you might come away feeling a bit confused. The song’s stark, fuzz-bleached minimalism is an inversion of what's expected from the typical Fresh &amp; Onlys track; it's zoned-out, rather than urgent, and the chugging chords are blurred by a generous dose of distortion. The drums have been stripped down to the steady thud of a single kick, and sunshine only sneaks in via the barbershop-style vocal harmonies that buoy the chorus. The shift in style takes a little bit to get used to.</p>
<p><i>House of Spirits </i>finds the Fresh &amp; Onlys in a gloomy place. It’s a spooky, desert-rock answer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">the Cure</a>’s <i>Faith</i>, another record awash in both reverb and metaphysical turmoil. “The point of forgetting is so you can live,” despairs Cohen on the chilly “Animal of One”. “The purpose of living is harder to find.” The Fresh &amp; Onlys’ music has touched on downcast themes before, but in the past, these bummin’ sentiments were often tempered a touch of self-effacing humor. Here, Cohen’s gonzo imagery and weirdo-narratives feel more earnest in their evocation of hard times.</p>
<p>To be fair, there’s been a lot going on for the Fresh &amp; Onlys’ over the last couple of years: most of the band’s San Francisco garage rock comrades have split town, bassist Shayde Sartin’s <a href=""http://www.ssgmusic.com/interview-shayde-sartin-fresh-onlys/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">apartment burned down</a>, and Cohen had a kid and temporarily re-located to an isolated Arizona horse ranch, where he demoed most of the record’s songs. On prior LPs, the rest of the band—Sartin, guitarist Wymond Miles, and drummer Kyle Gibson—took Cohen’s home demos and pushed them into headier territory, transforming a mostly acoustic track like ""Tropical Island Suite"" into the 7-minute centerpiece from 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14736-play-it-strange/""><i>Play It Strange</i></a>. On <i>House of Spirits,</i> the divide between the singer's folksier solo output and his work with Fresh &amp; Onlys has gotten a little harder to spot. With it’s clean guitars and bobbing rhythm, “Ballerina” could have easily slotted into <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18841-magic-trick-river-of-souls/"">River of Souls</a>, </i>Cohen's latest effort with his side project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29813-magic-trick"">Magic Trick</a>.</p>
<p>On the second half of <i>House of Spirits</i>, the mood leavens a bit. ""Hummingbird"" and ""April Fools"" find Fresh &amp; Onlys sounding a little more like their old selves—and if the bulk of <i>House of Spirits</i> is lacking a bit of urgency, the band compensates in other ways. When they were still recording the bulk of their music at home, the Fresh &amp; Onlys worked fast and as a result it sometimes seemed like the clock was working against Cohen’s lyrics, which recycled or smudged only a few words from verse to verse. <i>House of Spirits</i>, then, contains some of his most uniquely weird and vivid work, whether he's contemplating supernatural-style domestic unrest on ""Home is Where"" or reconciling abandonment issues with a demonic possessor on ""Who Let the Devil"". Album closer ""Madness"" finds Cohen reflecting on an LP's worth of emotional unrest with a touch of nostalgia. ""Madness has a heart, letting me rejoice in the most peculiar things,"" he sings. ""Your occurrence in my heart, giving me a voice, is the most beautiful thing.""</p>
<p>When the Fresh &amp; Onlys' released their first 7"" back in 2009, the band was preoccupied with scuzzy psych-rock homage. Since then, they've covered more grounds than most of their Bay Area peers, swapping in stylistic nods to the gothy end '80s LA punk and '80s UK guitar rock. <i>House of Spirits</i> doesn't bring much in the way of sonic surprises beyond a few drum machines and synths, but it does find the band making subtle changes to its M.O., delivering a set of songs that's less urgent, but—in a freaky-yet-endearing way—more personal. </p></div>"|19427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19427-the-fresh-onlys-house-of-spirits/|7.0|Aaron Leitko

But just three months after the release of the<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19012-tomas-barfod-pulsing-ep/""><i> Pulsing</i></a> EP, Barfod is back with a proper follow-up to his 2012 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16790-salton-sea/""><i>Salton Sea</i></a>, and the title of his new record, <i>Love Me,</i> seems like a bit of a laugh on Barfod’s part. Even if you feel the least bit lukewarm about his music, he’ll wear you down with an hour of mild, mid-tempo body music until you grant him your grudging admiration.</p>
<p><span> <i>Pulsing</i> was a stopgap effort where Barfod began to straddle vocal electro-pop and abstract, instrumental fare in equal measure; with <i>Love Me</i>, he devotes an unprecedented amount of his energy to the former realm, realizing his vision with the help of a small group of close collaborators. </span><span>He's steadily built a diverse personal universe of songwriting partners, guest vocalists, and associates who feature on <i>Love Me</i>: Barfod’s WhoMadeWho bandmate Jeppe Kjellberg, fellow countryman Brian Batz (who records slow, strange dream pop as Sleep Party People), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30716-night-beds"">Night Beds</a>' Winston Yellen, New Orleans rapper/singer Pell. The strongest of these collaborations give the album an eclectic, nicely varied feel, especially Yellen's turn on ""Sell You"", which is rendered lonely and distant by way of vocal processing.</span><br/> <br/> <span>Barfod’s prinicipal collaborator is Swedish vocalist Nina K, who appeared on <i>Salton Sea</i> highlight “November Skies” and <i>Pulsing</i>’s title track, the latter of which also appears on <i>Love Me</i>. Nina is featured on four of the album’s eleven tracks, all of which can be counted among its finest moments; t</span><span>heir chemistry remains palpable, as they’ve learned to strike just the right balance between Barfod’s beat-heavy, rhythmically forward production and the lightness of Nina’s vocals. The moody, string-swooning “Aftermath” sets a new high water mark for their partnership; yearning and raw, it comes off as their own downcast version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"">Robyn</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5802-kleerup/"">Kleerup</a>’s masterful </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ojHWQrm4UM&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“With Every Heartbeat”</a><span>, still a standard-bearer for heartbroken electro-pop balladry.</span><br/> <br/> <span>The success of the non-Nina K collaborations scattered throughout the remainder of <i>Love Me</i> depend on the vocalist: “Bell House” thrives thanks to a alien performance from pop-folk nomad and Here We Go Magic frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5614-luke-temple/"">Luke Temple</a>, while back-half features by Kjellberg and Pell sink unmemorably into the morass. One downside to Barfod’s chosen compositional style—tempos that rarely stray from middle-ground territory, standard-issue electronic tones, rhythms that split the difference between organic and machine-based—is that the onus to shape his songs is largely on his collaborators, so when he's not working with Nina K, his hit rate’s more scattershot as a result.</span> <span><i>Love Me</i> ultimately confirms what we already knew about Barfod’s solo work: he plays well with others, but a greater overall consistency might garner him the love he’s seeking. </span></p></div>"|19432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19432-tomas-barfod-love-me/|7.1|Jamieson Cox

Though they began as a formidable sludge outfit, the Chicago band’s old mold had broken by the time they recorded their second album, 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15936-an-ache-for-the-distance""><i>An Ache for the Distance</i></a>, which turned black metal torment into post-rock splendor, mid-tempo marches into alternate-universe alternative rock, and late-album comedowns into psychedelic dreamstates. Even the band’s personnel confirmed those polyglot tendencies; screamer Stavros Giannopoulos and singer David Kush traded guttural yells and grand refrains, conjuring incredible tension through variety and unpredictability. On <i>An Ache for the Distance</i>,<i> </i>you could hear the Atlas Moth sorting through a few dozen passions and touchstones on every song—from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1051-deftones/"">Deftones</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> to the Allman Brothers Band and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"">Neurosis</a>. At any moment, their next move was always a question mark.</p>
<p><i>The Old Believer</i>, their first following three years of <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/atlas-moth-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">personal and professional turmoil</a>, embraces many of those same sounds. “Collider” pivots between a great burst of swollen, righteous groove rock and prismatic psych, with elements of metals both blackened and doom at work, too. “City of Light” puts neon electronics beneath a stuttering, snapping beat, synthesizers undulating beneath the hook in a wonderful <i>kosmiche</i> haze. More than ever, the Atlas Moth depend upon the dynamic between Giannopoulos and Kush; they alternately take separate verses, nest opposing lyrics inside of one another’s voices and, during the album’s most dramatic moments, even sing together.</p>
<p>The two-frontman approach suits <i>The Old Believer</i>’s the album’s fraught, searching content. Since <i>An Ache for the Distance</i>, <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/atlas-moth-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Giannopoulos lost his mother and his girlfriend</a>, Kush his grandfather, producer and guitarist Andrew Ragin his hips, and the band veteran drummer Anthony Mainiero. They explore self-doubt and existential quandaries, wondering about any afterlife and searching for <a href=""http://sciencenotes.ucsc.edu/2011/pages/ayahuasca/ayahuasca.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an escape in the liquid drugs of South America</a>. Near the end of the album’s most emblematic track, “The Sea Beyond”, Giannopoulos and Kush cycle around one another, Giannopoulos lamenting loss as Kush repeats “I know you’re always with me” as a maxim of self-assurance. Giannopoulos eventually joins him, the shouting and the singing perfectly and unexpectedly balancing despair and hope.</p>
<p>But by and large, the Atlas Moth’s variety seems to have begot its own homogeny here, so that each move the band makes now feels like one you’ve either heard before or would have imagined upon prompting. Perhaps to accompany the more somber subject material, the Atlas Moth drift deeper into the shoegaze interests that have previously been only dalliances. The guitars hang low and loud, and twinkling keyboards fill cracks that spiderweb throughout the sound. More often than not, though, the softness mitigates the heaviness, or at least couches the blows until the impact all but disappears. Even when Giannopoulos is seething about dejection above surging guitars during “Halcyon Blvd”, the power seems padded, and the slow, steady wallop of “Hesperian” feels like a choice between the distortion of shoegaze and doom gone unmade, leaving the song to linger in the ineffectual middle distance. After the heavy touring cycle behind <i>An Ache for the Distance</i>, The Atlas Moth split with Mainiero, a dynamo capable of meeting and adding power to the band’s stylistic shifts. But part of the flat-line predictability here stems from Daniel Lasek, the new drummer who loves to find a mid-tempo beat and rarely leave it. For a band that’s flourished through a sense of whiplash, he’s an overly steady, cautious chauffer.</p>
<p>The cover of <i>The Old Believer</i> depicts an alabaster-skinned woman in a matching white dress, blending into the walls like a camouflaged angel. She’s seated, staring calmly at the camera. But if you <a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2014/05/12/happens-run-atlas-moths-new-album-water/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hold the cover beneath water for a few seconds</a>, the scene goes hellish: The black walls of some dim chamber appear. She grows horns, and her eyes become black pits, a sanguine stain shaping a thin V beneath them, from her neck to her waist. For Profound Lore, the relatively scheme-free label that’s released the last two albums by The Atlas Moth, the trickery is tantamount to a picture disc or a limited-edition release. Designed by Ryan Clark, both images are beautiful, and the effect is chilling. It’s too bad, then, that the metaphor feels so off for <i>The Old Believer</i>. The Atlas Moth hope to be heavy <i>and</i> heavenly, aggressive <i>and</i> accessible, to exist in worlds of light and dark simultaneously. In this instance, they wind up in the shadows of their own intentions, hidden in flat gray instead of beautiful white or harrowing black. </p></div>"|19444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19444-the-atlas-moth-the-old-believer/|6.7|Grayson Haver Currin

After 2013's electronic-focused <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17854-altar-of-plagues-teethed-glory-and-injury/""><i>Teethed Glory and Injury</i></a>, he called an end to that band's aggression and physical brutality in favor of the morose atmospherics of his bass-focused solo project WIFE; the first full-length to emerge out of Kelly's fractured electronic inclinations, <i>What's Between</i>, draws from the same barren palette as his past work, but it attempts to approach that darkness through uplifting synth swells and dead-eyed vocalizations rather than screeches and squalls.</p>
<p>At his most focused, Kelly's work recalls the beat-driven bleakness of Ross Tones' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30850-throwing-snow/"">Throwing Snow</a> (whose Left_Blank label released WIFE's first missive, 2012's <i>Stoic</i> EP) or his new Tri Angle labelmates. In particular, ""Dans Ce"" batters Kelly's saccharine vocal with abrasive percussion scrapes and pointillist synth parts, warping his pop predilections into something less easy to apprehend. Because Kelly is given to flighty genre exercises, though, <i>What's Between</i> often feels fragmented and mangled; the leftfield house banger ""Living Joy"" sidles right next to the creeping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>-isms of ""A Nature Shards"", and the brooding vocals and distant clinks that finish off the moody closer ""Further Not Better"" couldn't be further away from the sunny-eyed emoting of the record's opening salvo ""Like Chrome.""<br/><br/>That sonic inconsistency can work in Kelly's favor—check the nearly-nauseating transition from the skulking ooze of ""Tongue"" and the vacant, reconstructed R&amp;B of ""Heart Is A Far Light""—but his lack of focus robs <i>What's Between</i> of a definite collective identity. Gone are Altar of Plagues' high-minded ideas and 18-minute movements, and in their place are disfigured attempts at inky beat-pop. Kelly is, as ever, able to conjure disaffection and gloom from his expansive instrumentation, but he hasn't quite figured out how to turn digital desolation into something that matches the emotional and narrative force of his influences. <i>What's Between</i> provides some compelling glimpses at Kelly's cimmerian headspace, but knowing that he possesses the ability and the vision to flesh out his own ideas, it's hard not to be left wanting more.</p></div>"|19448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19448-wife-whats-between/|6.0|Colin Joyce

But then, serendipity is how <i>Skisser </i> and its follow-up <i>EP II</i>—released together as Boman’s North American debut—came to be. Boman recorded a couple demos but hadn’t totally committed to releasing them; then, Malmö-based label Adrian heard them and decided to squeeze one more release onto their calendar. The label claims that, upon hearing Boman's demos, “<a href=""http://adrianrecordings.com/artists/alice-boman/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">time itself stopped</a>”—a lofty claim for a collection of recordings that are at times pleasant and promising, but mostly underdeveloped.</p>
<p><i>Skisser </i>translates to “sketches,” which an apt description of Boman’s sound contained on that particular EP. The sonic palette is simple—piano, voice, a lot of haze and space. In terms of progression, the <i>EP II </i>material doesn't offer much more than its predecessor: there's acoustic guitar, orchestral flourishes, and backing vocals, but quietness again reigns. Boman’s voice is a small instrument, but given its size she accomplishes quite a bit with it—although she often sounds like someone else. At times, she’s a raspy ringer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4372-emiliana-torrini/"">Emiliana Torrini</a>; elsewhere, she essays an alt-country wisp not dissimilar to labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9328-cate-le-bon/"">Cate Le Bon</a>, or reverbs her voice to a glassy polish a<i> </i>la Sarah Brightman.</p>
<p>There’s not much to the tracks featured on this release, which is both good and bad. When Boman’s tracks succeed, this simplicity lends them a distant quality, so the gloomy summer lilts “Over” and “Lead Me” benefit from the sparseness, as do organ and synth mirages “Skiss 8” and “Skiss 2.” More often, though, the tracks are just indistinct; songs that might be haunting in isolation start to cloud together well before the first EP’s finished. Worse, the spare settings place a greater-than-normal focus on the lyrics, which could have used a few more trips to the sketchbook. For every pleasingly simple line like “You know I need the darkness just as much I need the light,” there’s baby-food lines like “I want you more than I need you/ I need you bad/ Are you coming back?”</p>
<p>So it’s best to take <i>EP II </i>and <i>Skisser </i>as what they are: detailed sketches, but ultimately not much more than early drafts. If anything, despite its indicator as a point of progress, <i>EP II </i>might possess more sonic missteps; the remix EP for <i>Skisser </i>offered far more dynamic settings for Boman’s songwriting than what's on display here, proving that against tenser backgrounds, Boman’s voice stands out as slight and startling. It’s a direction worth exploring, even if <i>EP II</i> suggests that she doesn't plan on doing so; now that Boman’s proven herself adept at exuding calm, her next effort could benefit from embracing stormier sounds.</p></div>"|19445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19445-alice-boman-ep-ii-skisser/|5.7|Katherine St. Asaph

That’s how long <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream/"">Primal Scream</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJU0JZTtDLQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Velocity Girl”</a> lasts, and the song was enough to have crystallized an entire era and established an undying narrative. As the opening track of <i>C86</i>—a 22-song cassette compilation of British indie bands released by the legendary music magazine <i>NME</i> in 1986—“Velocity Girl” has become iconic. Around the time of its release, Primal Scream’s frontman, Bobby Gillespie, left his post as the drummer of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"">the Jesus and Mary Chain</a>. Disentangled from that band's major-label whirlwind, he resumed activity with the virtually unknown project he'd initially formed in 1982. Primal Scream then proceeded to reduce the pop song to its subatomic essence: quick, breezy, quirky, and above all, exquisitely small.</p>
<p>“Velocity Girl” sounded humble, but it was not without ambition. It falls shy of the minute-and-half mark, and shyness can be heard in the song’s desperate refrain: “Leave me alone,” Gillespie pleads in a Glaswegian warble as guitars ring like chimes around him. It was the sound of soaring punk rock as filtered through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"">the Byrds</a>, and its expression of angry introversion— told in an almost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a>-esque manner, via the tale of a troubled, sensitive young woman— was only the first stage of evolution for Primal Scream, whose sprawling 1991 album <i>Screamadelica </i>would all but eclipse their formative work. Regardless of what the future held for Gillespie, “Velocity Girl” became <i>C86</i>’s signature song, and it’s the track that, more than any other on the tape, helped turn <i>C86</i> from a comp into a genre.</p>
<p>After 28 years of being held by many as the gold standard for indie-pop—and of being a hefty influence, direct or otherwise, on everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"">Belle and Sebastian</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"">the Strokes</a>—<i>C86 </i>is getting a lavish reissue with two bonus discs have been assembled by one of its original curators, former <i>NME </i>writer Neil Taylor, who also supplies copious liner notes (drawn in part from his upcoming book, <i>C86 &amp; All That:Indie 1983-86</i>). These 50 bonus tracks represent an additional fifty bands that Taylor claims should have been contenders to be on <i>C86</i> in the first place, and his claim is correct. Not only does the expanded reissue provide context and insight, it’s packed to the back teeth with song after head-spinning song. One of the joys of <i>C86 </i>has always been its impressive lack of filler, and even expanded to a staggering 72 songs, this holds true.</p>
<p>Two words pop up most often in discussions about <i>C86</i>—“jangle” and “twee”—and although those who make those associations aren’t inaccurate, the descriptors don't tell the whole story. Inspired largely by the bands on <i>C86</i>’s ancestor, 1981’s <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VuEEFjunk4&amp;list=PLSaRzcqvDI0KeGeOUD6ZdZpqLes7C7UZJ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">C81</a></i> compilation—which featured, amid various post-punk, industrial and ska luminaries along with the wiry romanticism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5044-josef-k/"">Josef K</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"">Orange Juice</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16161-aztec-camera/"">Aztec Camera</a>, three alumni of Glasgow’s Postcard Records—the jangly, twee bands on this reissue wholeheartedly embrace their forebears. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3263-the-pastels/"">The Pastels</a>, who had yet to install themselves as stalwart upholders of the <i>C86</i> torch, crawl along forlornly with “Breaking Lines,” while Miaow—who recorded for Factory Records and were led by <i>NME</i> writer Cath Carroll, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b23nNeAEHt4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">later immortalized</a> by her unabashed fans in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4425-unrest/"">Unrest</a>—brought a jaunty spring to their indie-pop step. McCarthy, featuring future <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab"">Stereolab</a> mastermind Tim Gane on guitar, waltzes wistfully with “Celestial City”. On one of the bonus discs, B.M.X. Bandits (featuring a pre-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4181-teenage-fanclub/"">Teenage Fanclub</a> Norman Blake), finally get their due with the charmingly remedial <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5wz9nCo5ds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“E102”</a>; in 1989, the band cheekily titled their debut album <i>C86</i>. A mere three years after the release of the compilation, it was already being mythologized.</p>
<p>While some stereotypes affiliated with <i>C86</i> have been overstated over the years, there is an aching, shimmering delicacy at the heart of the compilation's more elfin contributors—but the ghost of punk past still lingers. Razorcuts named themselves after a line from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/522-buzzcocks"">Buzzcocks</a>’ “Love You More”, and their track that appears here, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQA1Oeana7c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Sad Kaleidoscope”</a>, is an unabashed homage to Pete Shelley’s warbling, wimp-punk songcraft. The Buzzcocks don’t get mentioned often as an influence on the <i>C86</i> school, but on this reissue, the evidence is everywhere—from Pop Will Eat Itself’s buzzing “Mesmerized” (made before they became sample-heavy provocateurs, and before frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2667-clint-mansell/"">Clint Mansell</a> scored Darren Aronofsky films) to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21813-talulah-gosh"">Talulah Gosh</a>’s lo-fi, pop-punk romp <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XElmxiQiBpc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I Told You So”</a> (made before sugar-spiked singer Amelia Fletcher formed the more refined <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1914-heavenly"">Heavenly</a>). <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4564-the-wedding-present/"">The Wedding Present</a> fall loosely into this camp, too, even though their song for the original <i>C86</i> tracklist, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nAu7yRxPes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“This Boy Can Wait (A Bit Longer)”</a>, demonstrated just how much mastermind David Gedge seemed to want to one-up his peers in regard to heart-pounding desperation, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"">Smiths</a>-inspired cleverness, and an inhumanly hyperactive strum that put many thrash guitarists of the time to shame.</p>
<p>The line between <i>C86</i>’s jangly, dreamy representatives and its more distortion-smothered counterparts is blurred by bands like 14 Iced Bears. An oddity both then and now, the group’s song featured here, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoYzrkMumQs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Inside”</a>, alchemically combines droning noise, hushed melancholy, and a nearly nauseating aura of discordance that presages My Bloody Valentine’s <i>Isn’t Anything</i> by two years (a time when MBV themselves had barely begun to absorb the influence of <i>C86</i>). But 14 Iced Bears aren’t the only group on the box set that prophesied shoegaze: “Go Ahead, Cry” by 14 Iced Bears’ Sarah Records labelmate, St. Christopher,is underlain with an atmospheric smear of static that might as well be a wormhole to the next three decades of noise-pop.</p>
<p>On the other end of the gentleness spectrum, Meat Whiplash’s “Here It Comes” is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a>-indebted goth with a <i>Metal Machine Music</i> fetish, a bizarre formula that nonetheless feels as much like proto-shoegaze as anything on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/129-facing-the-other-way-4ad-martin-aston/"">4AD</a> roster in 1986. And the Jesus and Mary Chain, one of the prime sources of <i>C86</i>’s DNA, are officially canonized in the compilation's canon with the inclusion of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ByT8LC9WuA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Inside Me”</a>,  from its 1984 debut <i>Psychocandy</i>. The similarity between the titles of 14 Iced Bears’ and JAMC’s tracks isn’t likely intentional, but it’s eerily telling: again, the specter of introversion—of masking one’s mumbling sweetness behind sheets of lacerating, pseudo-psychedelic treble—is raised, and loudly.</p>
<p>Every precious stereotype associated with <i>C86</i>, however, is blown out of the water by the box set’s avant-garde contingent. Big Flame’s “New Way (Quick Wash and Brush Up with Liberation Theology)” is a Manchester-bred doppleganger of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"">Minutemen</a>’s funky, sardonically militant post-punk; Stump exhibits bona fide musical virtuosity on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-PmQ3dFQvs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Buffalo”</a>, even if it’s bent toward a Carl-Stalling-meets-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Captain Beefheart</a> cartoonishness that ultimately provides one of <i>C86</i>’s most singular, brilliant moments. The Nightingales—a veteran of the '77 punk scene that included ex-members of the Prefects, who toured with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"">the Clash</a> for their legendary White Riot Tour— feed wobbly folk into post-punk on “Part Time Moral England”, right around the time that their contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2730-mekons/"">Mekons</a> were beginning to do the same. The spirit of '77 manifests itself in an entirely different way on Pigbros’ “Hedonist Hat”, a clanging, churning, art-rock spasm that draws reverently from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>’s 1977 album <i>Before and After Science</i>. Partly in defense of these perpetual <i>C86</i> outliers—the geeks so weird that they make the other geeks nervous —<i>The Guardian</i> recently a piece titled <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/mar/14/c86-myths-nme-indie-cassette-debunked"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“C86: The myths about the NME’s indie cassette debunked”</a>. As well-intentioned as it is, it misses the point: The sounds may be different, but the souls are simpatico.</p>
<p>As eclectic as <i>C86</i> is, by no means does it try to encompass the entire British indie scene circa 1986. As Taylor recounts in his liner notes, “The aim […] was to take an aural snapshot of the <i>moment</i>. Were these acts representative of the state of a certain kind of indie music at that time? Very much so. Was <i>C86</i> intended to be the be-all and end-all of independent music at that time? Of course not”. In fact, some bands refused to be included, fearing it would lead to being pigeonholed—like the June Brides, one of the major players in the admittedly loose-knit scene that <i>C86</i> gathered together. That’s been rectified by the reissue, with the June Brides’ horn-punched, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/619-burt-bacharach/"">Burt Bacharach</a>-like gem <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu0o37sNIk4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Just the Same”</a> serving as the first song on the box set’s first bonus disc. And some bands that were surely nowhere near being seriously considered in the first place— such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5891-happy-mondays/"">Happy Mondays</a>, whose undercooked <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rLspUDFT0Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Freaky Dancin’”</a> is a minor skirmish of the dancefloor havoc they’d go on to wreak— serve more as a historical curiosity than a corrected omission.</p>
<p>Hindsight has been more than kind to <i>C86</i>, but not everyone agrees on its place in the indie firmament. In Marc Spitz’s new book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Twee-Gentle-Revolution-Television-Fashion/dp/0062213040/ref=la_B001IQWPVW_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401983258&amp;sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion, and Film</i></a>, Sarah Records cofounder Matt Haynes maintains that, “Even by the time it was released, <i>C86</i> was being treated as a term of abuse, and most of the writers [at <i>NME</i>] were embarrassed by it. These days, people tend to think of it as a landmark moment, but… I think that’s a slight rewriting of history.” Revisionism, though, is the prerogative of the reissue curator—and that prerogative is exercised impeccably by Taylor, who glosses over none of the conflict or confusion of the era in either his liner notes or his choice of bonus material. This reissue<i> </i>triumphs by celebrating, rather than denying, the richness and invention—the dissonance and paradox—at play within a small scene of bands whose joyously erratic racket was much huger than their humble songs could contain.</p></div>"|19423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19423-c86/|9.2|Jason Heller

Popcaan, aka Andre Jay Sutherland, is the current leader in the neverending battle for supremacy among Jamaican deejays, but unlike previous kings of the hill (most recently, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23359-movado/"">Mavado</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12970-vybz-kartel/"">Vybz Kartel</a>, the latter <span>who also has functioned as Sutherland’s mentor</span>) he’s not overly concerned with projecting the image of a badman. He’s a lover, not a gangster, and it’s an impressively broad kind of love that he’s putting out. <i>Where We Come From</i> is a party, and everyone’s invited.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The album was executive produced by Brooklyn beatmaker and Mixpak label owner Dre Skull, aka Andrew Hershey, who’s become an unlikely heavyweight in the Jamaican music scene thanks to jubilant compositions like the <i>Kling Klang</i> and <i>Loudspeaker</i> riddims. He also worked on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4102-snoop-dogg/"">Snoop Dogg</a>’s reggae rebrand as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30583-snoop-lion/"">Snoop Lion</a> alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a> and Ariel Rechtshaid, and <i>Where We Come From</i> feels like another attempt at doing what last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17920-snoop-lion-reincarnated/""><i>Reincarnated</i></a> failed to do: connect dancehall with an American pop audience that hasn’t seen an actual dancehall artist on the pop charts in years.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Sutherland and Hershey make a great team. Sutherland has a super-melodic flow (he’s what is sometimes referred to as a “singjay”) and nimble sense of melody, so Hershey's beats offer a lot of opportunities to exploit both talents, even as they stick to chord progressions that don't stray from dancehall's conventions. Hershey's production skills also make a good platform for Sutherland's expressive delivery, converting the plaintive strings and funereal tolling bells of “Hold On” into triumphant uplift and the stroboscopic rave synths of “Ghetto (Tired of Crying)” into a meditation on violence tinged with hint of hopefulness.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Overall, <i>Where We Come From</i> isn’t animated by solemnity, or even the salaciousness that infuses “Number One Freak” and “Love Yuh Bad”, but an ecstatic joy that transcends genre. Sutherland is a massively charismatic character, and it’s hard not to get caught up in the elation that he so obviously feels when he gets from finding the perfect groove. That feeling permeates every corner of the album, but it comes through strongest on two particular tracks. The thematic concerns of “Everything Nice” are right there in the title, and it’s easy to feel the same way while the song is playing, thanks to a buoyant, bliss-inducing beat by Mixpak-affiliated producer Dubbel Dutch (who’s responsible for five of the 13 tracks).</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“Waiting So Long,” on the other hand, bursts with kinetic energy. The beat, by Swedish producer Adde Instrumentals (who also produced Sutherland’s 2011 Jamaican hit “Ravin”), is a techno-bubblegummy pileup of whining synths, string stabs, and handclaps that, boosted by Sutherland’s recursively loopy vocal melody, constantly reaches higher and higher towards giddy new levels of euphoria, exploding kaleidoscopically like the all-out finale of a fireworks explosion that lasts three straight minutes. It’s the type of song that can push everything else completely out of your field of attention for its entire duration, one of those pop moments that fully deserves to be called “transcendental.” In a perfect world, it would be a smash; as far as the one we live in now, it’s noticeably better for having this song  and <i>Where We Come From </i>in it.</span></p></div>"|19426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19426-popcaan-where-we-come-from/|8.0|Miles Raymer

Under the guise of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3485-the-pretenders/"">the Pretenders</a>, Hynde operated as the leader of a constantly evolving gang, a dynamic that always seemed of paramount importance to her. The power of the Pretenders hinged explicitly on Hynde's personality and musical force, but she always made clear that the Pretenders were a band, and that she was no solo act—so <i>Stockholm</i>, the first album Hynde's released under her own name, represents a left turn for her career. <br/><br/><i>Stockholm</i> was recorded in the album’s titular city with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4966-peter-bjorn-and-john/"">Peter Bjorn and John</a>'s Björn Yttling, who also co-wrote most of the songs and contributed guitar; the record also features contributions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>, the Caesars’ Joakin Åhlund, and—most inexplicably—tennis legend John McEnroe. Despite its wily pedigree, though, <i>Stockholm</i> is a relatively staid affair. Hynde’s voice remains one of the most distinctively emotive in all of rock music and, to his credit, Yttling has the good sense to always place it high in the mix. Still, Hynde’s vibrato is too often matched with bland lyrics and production that's overly glossy.</p>
<p>Hynde is at her best when delivering withering, offhand indictments, so “Dark Sunglasses” is one of the album's treats. Dismissing those who have traded their integrity for the cache of coolness—“A kind of glamour you can lend yourself/ Like dark sunglasses/ And you'll remember how good it tasted/ Inside the ruling classes”—the song hints at the kind of thorny, playfully acerbic persona that has made Hynde such a force to be reckoned with throughout her career. Unfortunately, on <i>Stockholm</i>, Hynde’s usually effortless badassery too often gets buried under forgettable tunes. There is a weird irony in hearing Hynde sing “I’ve become what I criticized” on “Down The Wrong Way”, a track tugged along by Neil Young’s blistering guitar work but dogged by a sing-songy chorus that would've barely made it as a Pretenders B-side back in the '80s. “You or No One” and “Sweet Nuthin'” are serviceable pop exercises, but they also lack any discernable bite, trading in clichés rather than revealing anything interesting about Hynde herself—a shame, since she’s arguably lived a very fascinating life. <br/><br/>It’s only when she seems to let her guard down, as in the lovely album closer “Adding the Blue” that Hynde’s genius shines on <i>Stockholm</i>. A doleful, truly beautiful attempt to memorialize a past love, it’s a stunning reminder of how Hynde’s voice can make even the simplest lines truly heartrending. When she sings “I can't draw from memories or photos/ I need blood and breath, but you left me nothing,” it’s as stirring a moment as anything from her expansive back catalog; ""Adding the Blue"" also leaves one wishing that the rest of <i>Stockholm</i> could have been as emotionally arresting.</p>
<p>In <i>Stockholm</i>’s press materials, Hynde says, “I wanted to make a power pop album you could dance to—Abba meets John Lennon.” It’s frustrating that the results don't match the aims; here, she’s made a mostly fine, overly polished adult contemporary record that feels oddly generic, especially coming from her. At this point in her career, Hynde has sold more than 25 million records, so she has certainly earned the right to do whatever the hell she wants. Still, for someone capable of crafting truly perfect pop songs like “Talk of the Town” and “Message of Love”, the treacle that shows up time and again on <i>Stockholm</i> is confounding. As a distilled 5-song EP, <i>Stockholm</i> might have served as a refreshing slap in the face—a potent reminder of what a vibrant jolt of lightning Chrissie Hynde can be—but instead, it's a rather wan listen. She remains one of rock music’s most fantastically singular talents, but with this experiment now behind her, maybe it’s time to get the old band name back together again.</p></div>"|19447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19447-chrissie-hynde-stockholm/|5.8|T.

That’s the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30523-foxygen/"">Foxygen</a> origin story in a nutshell, but just a year after that band’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4137-richard-swift/"">Richard Swift</a>-produced breakthrough, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17552-we-are-the-21st-century-ambassadors-of-peace-magic/""><i>We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace &amp; Magic</i></a>, their 23-year-old guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31422-jonathan-rado/"">Jonathan Rado</a> is already eager to replay the script—only this time, he’s promoted himself to the big-brother role.</p>
<p>Dub Thompson—that is, singer/guitarist Matt Pulos and drummer Evan Laffer, both 19—hail from Agoura Hills, the next burg over from Foxygen’s native Westlake Village. And one presumes Rado saw some of Foxygen’s industrious, irreverent spirit in his fellow county-folk, resulting in an invite to record their debut album in a house Rado was renting last summer in Bloomington, Ind. But the band heard on <i>9 Songs</i> proves to be less Foxygen’s dutiful doppleganger than its evil twin. Where Foxygen put an absurdist, playful spin on the canonical classic rock of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Dylan</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">the Stones</a>, Dub Thompson proffer a combustible collision of various record-collector subgenres—’60s proto-punk garage, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Beefheart</a>-ian skronk, Krautrock, discofied post-punk, hardcore, mid-‘80s American indie, and, yes, even a daub of dub—all captured by Rado in a perfectly grainy patina that makes it sound like the band is performing on a live pirate-radio broadcast in the basement.  <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">And </span>though<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> Dub Thompson wear their rough edges proudly</span>—and don't yet feel the urge to develop their melodic craft beyond one-line lyrics and monotone shouts<b>—</b><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">the unfinished veneer feels less a product of slackadasical whimsy than an urgency to cram as many oddball ideas into their songs as possible.</span></p>
<p>But for all the hyperactive energy and compulsive structural shifts in effect here, <i>9 Songs</i> rarely feels like a mess. Fortunately, this is a band that gets most of the silliness of its system through nomenclature: <i>9 Songs</i> actually only contains eight tracks—one of which is an acid-splattered instrumental titled “9 Songs”. And while there are songs about dinosaurs (“Pterodactyls”), there are also songs that sound like they’re about dinosaurs but actually aren’t (“Epicondyles”, which is the bone joint prone to tennis elbow—no doubt an epidemic malady in their hometown). But for the most part, Pulos and Laffer attack their material with an authority and simmering menace that allows seemingly incompatible elements to come together in surprisingly complementary ways: the no-verse, all-chorus single “No Time” finds an ideal home for a Nuggets-worthy harmony hook in the midst of a reggafied funk strut; “Dograces” hitches a deadpan vocal and grimy 4/4 groove to a regal keyboard fanfare and marching-band breakdown that suggests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a> gone prog.</p>
<p>Inevitably, when a band is being pulled in so many directions, they’re bound to drift down a wayward path, and the carnivalesque prance of “Ash Wednesday” makes you wonder why Dub Thompson saved their most focused performance for their most tedious song. But if not all of Dub Thompson’s ideas work, the more important takeaway is that, at this early stage, they sound like a band with no lack of them.</p></div>"|19341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19341-dub-thompson-9-songs/|6.7|Stuart Berman

Similar to the majority of artists in that field, his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29172-craft-spells"">Craft Spells</a> project wouldn’t have stood a chance if it was evaluated by the standard metrics of pop and rock: melodic ingenuity, sonic innovation, whether or not it actually “rocks”. The main appeal of Craft Spells is how the music gives the listener an ability to parse the many subtle differences in the various states of being by one’s self<span>—</span>there’s the attractive aspects (solitary, lone) and the not-so-attractive (isolated, lonely). The former were covered by his 2011 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15280-idle-labor/""><i>Idle Labor</i></a>, a solo record by necessity that dealt with crushes, dates, makeout sessions and of course, post-breakup recoiling.  Influenced by Vallesteros’ admitted, unhealthy relationship with social media, <i>Nausea </i>unsurprisingly finds him erring towards the latter.</p>
<p>This is a peculiar result, as Craft Spells has left the proverbial bedroom, enlisting a <i>real</i> producer and becoming a <i>real</i> band, so the crude drum machines that often lent songs on <i>Idle Labor</i> a necessary, rigid structure are swapped out for acoustic percussion that allows these new ones the chance to swing, to shuffle, to approach something close to typical rock catharsis. Likewise, Vallesteros wrote the entirety of <i>Nausea</i> on piano, while the harsh, digital reverb is now soft and analog.</p>
<p><i>Nausea</i> often sounds disembodied, as every instrument's given a glassy, shellacked quality. “Twirl” nearly achieves liftoff in its chorus before tapering off, lest it overheats and melts the surrounding coat. <i>Nausea</i>’s eerie sense of removal is most effective on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6330-elephant-6/"">Elephant 6</a> reverie of “Komorebi”, which takes its title from a Japanese word that loosely translates to “when sunlight filters through the trees”. At its best, <i>Nausea</i> takes after “Komorebi” in evoking a feeling that doesn’t have an exact verbal equivalent while sounding anachronistic in a way that’s both unnerving and fascinating, like watching colorized black &amp; white movie.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the production and arrangements often have to compensate for the monochromatic songwriting. The conception of <i>Nausea</i> was delayed as Vallesteros battled writer’s block<span>; </span>after the release of 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16591-craft-spells-gallery-ep/""><i>Gallery</i></a> EP, the Stockton transplant became bored with guitar, intimidated by the Bay Area's focus on raw garage rock and hip-hop and paralyzed by his reliance on social media. These are topics that are ripe for exploration, of feeling displaced and connected at the same time.  </p>
<p>And yet, while nearly every track on <i>Nausea</i> finds Vallesteros trying to grapple with these issues, he rarely wrenches out any insight or personal detail. Both plainspoken and vague, the lyrics of <i>Nausea</i> sound like the result of someone simply trying to overpower a mental deadlock. What's more, without the plug-and-play immediacy of <i>Idle Labor</i>, the limitations of Vallesteros’ abilities as a legit frontman are put into sharper relief. “Changing Faces” taps into the feline playfulness of <i>Japanese Whispers</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure"">Cure</a> by all but stealing its hook from “Let’s Go to Bed”, but it’s overshadowed by a distracting, offbeat verse that just sounds like it could use a better vocal take. Meanwhile, if “First Snow” has the most instantly ingratiating melody, it’s because Vallesteros slightly reworks the one from <i>Idle Labor</i>’s “After the Moment”, his best song to date.</p>
<p>Just because melody and verve aren’t the primary considerations for music of this sort doesn’t mean those considerations fail to matter. In fact, those are often the exact things that allow artists to stand out; it’s not Vallesteros’ fault that he shares a label with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing"">Wild Nothing</a>, who created a standard to which <i>Nausea</i> appears to have aspired. But whereas Jack Tatum sounded emboldened by his success and richer production values on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16969-nocturne/""><i>Nocturne</i></a>, Vallesteros retreats. There's evidence of his craftsmanship, like “Komorebi” and the muffled trip-hop outlier “If I Could”, which sound removed from the styles favored by his peers, and it's fitting: as you’d expect from a record whose title alludes to Vallesteros' reaction to Internet overload, he’d be well advised to get some fresh air.</p></div>"|19430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19430-craft-spells-nausea/|5.8|Ian Cohen

She was the only other person up on stage. In the current issue of <i>Rolling Stone, </i>he says, “I would often look at her onstage and say, ‘I can’t believe she’s up here.’ I don’t think she understood how important she was to the band, and to me and to music. She was the antithesis of a modern drummer. So childlike and incredible and inspiring.” That quote is a bit uncomfortable in its patronizing and primitivizing attitude toward Meg, but the White Stripes emphasized the “childlike” in nearly every aspect of the band, from their red-and-white wardrobe to their imaginative videos, to songs like “We’re Going to be Friends”.</p>
<p>Her chops might have been rudimentary, but Meg kept Jack’s guitar virtuosity in check and kept their music from being merely a display of technique. He soloed frequently but never pointlessly, and indulged none of the ostentatious jamming that defines blues rock: no white-boy blues face, no standing at the lip of the stage, no look-how-deeply-I-am-feeling-these-notes bullshit. That playful sound is what made the White Stripes so revolutionary in the 2000s. The blues has always prized instrumental prowess, but blues rock typically equates that trait with authenticity of emotion. After so many generations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23143-eric-clapton/"">Eric Claptons</a> and Jonny Langs, it was refreshing at the turn of the century to hear someone have fun with the form again. Like first-gen punks, the White Stripes proved you didn’t have to be good to be great, that your limitations could enable rather than hinder expression. Theirs was a <a href=""http://youtu.be/4OqveSybH0A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">little room</a>, as Jack sang on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8651-white-blood-cells/"" target=""_blank"">White Blood Cells</a></i>, but they still found many corners.</p>
<p>Since the White Stripes split, however, Jack moved into a bigger room, surrounded by musicians who are capable in the traditional sense of the word. His work has become fuller, of course, more elaborate and more conventionally ambitious; his idiosyncrasies have dimmed a bit, too, so his music is less subversive, less culture-shaking, less special. Despite their pedigree, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3674-the-raconteurs/"">Raconteurs</a> never really figured out their mission (although hiring country singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10879-ashley-monroe/"">Ashley Monroe</a> might be mission enough). The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27647-the-dead-weather/"">Dead Weather</a> can be admirably heavy and darkly savage, but also dour and claustrophobic, as though the riffs are closing in on you. White’s debut album, 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16534-blunderbuss/"">Blunderbuss</a></i>, reportedly inspired by his divorce from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28657-karen-elson/"">Karen Elson</a>, sounded uncharacteristically bilious, especially from the man who wrote “Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground”. In fact, nowadays White might be most compelling as a label impresario who releases new singles via balloons and coaxes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a> to record a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19295-neil-young-a-letter-home/"">covers album</a> in a modified phone booth. It’s the one role where he displays the same sense of childlike whimsy that motivated the White Stripes.</p>
<p><i>Lazaretto</i> makes all of his other projects sound a bit scrawny by comparison. It’s the densest, fullest, craziest, and most indulgent that White has sounded with or without Meg—almost pointedly so, as though he’s trying to shake the minimalism that defined the White Stripes. It’s an almost self-consciously busy-minded album, chockablock with ideas and sounds, all colliding violently and sometimes brutally. There’s a lot of pedal steel, a lot more barrelhouse piano, some folksy strumming, some rock-rapping, and the persistent buzz of White’s guitar. The most decorous and over-the-top song on <i>Lazaretto</i> (and arguably the standout) “Would You Fight for My Love?” plays like an exquisite corpse: It opens with a low, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"">Lynchian</a> hum, the kind you hear in your bowels, then morphs into something like a rock ballad, with Ikey Owens pounding out power chords on the piano. With its flatulent bass, the bridge sounds like Goblin scoring a murder scene, complete with spooky disembodied vocals. The song ends up in a Celtic honkytonk, somehow.</p>
<p>The instrumental “High Ball Stepper” is loaded with Bernard Hermann anxieties, while “Temporary Ground” elaborates gently on rural folk music, opening with a violin dancing gingerly around Maggie Björklund’s pedal steel (the song was reportedly inspired by gigantic lily pads that can support a man’s weight). “Just One Drink” plays like a Coca-Cola jingle; “Entitlement” is stately C&amp;W. Not everything fits together fluidly, but that might just be the point: These disparate sounds are not just accessories to be applied to blues rock, but rich veins of tradition that compete for primacy on <i>Lazaretto</i>. White invites us to see the craft here, to notice the seams, to consider the contrasts—not necessarily out of any self-congratulatory impulse, but out of awe for the endless permutations of American popular music.</p>
<p>White comes across like a man out of time on <i>Lazaretto</i>, a role that proves more sympathetic and relatable than the embittered lover he played on <i>Blunderbuss</i>; he seems to be having a lot more fun yelling at the kids to get off his lawn. “There are children today who were lied to, told the world is rightfully theirs,” he sings on “Entitlement”, a countercultural anthem that political midpoint between “Signs” and “Okie from Muskogee”. “Don’t they feel like they're cheated somehow? I feel like I've been cheated somehow.” His is not necessarily a generational complaint, though; instead, he just can’t understand why something given could ever be as precious as something earned.</p>
<p>In its volleys of nimble-fingered riffs and its willy-nilly combination of styles, <i>Lazaretto </i>is all about virtuosity, with White reverting back to the idea of blues rock as a form of emotional confession: a space where you can project feelings and re-enact age-old dramas. Yet, White sneaks in a few jokes at the idea. Witness this scene from “The Black Bat Licorice”: “She writes letters like a <a href=""http://www.toplessrobot.com/2008/09/the_10_greatest_chick_tract_minicomics_of_hellfire.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jack Chick</a> comic, just a bunch of propaganda/ She makes my fingers histrionic, like this [paint-peeling guitar riff] and this [paint-peeling guitar riff]!” It’s a funny little moment in a song that otherwise sounds leery of desire, wary of love, simultaneously burdened and freed by sex. Somehow, even with White rapping his lyrics like leprous carnival barker, it’s a great, nervy track, both sugary and sour. Still, the song provides another reminder of White's past glory days, as it might sound better stripped down to guitar and drums. </p></div>"|19420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19420-jack-white-lazaretto/|7.1|Stephen M.

With a piercing countertenor somewhere between Prince masquerading as<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreleased_Prince_projects#Camille"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Camille</span></a> and the cracking adolescent soul of the teenage Michael Jackson, the 19-year-old North Las Vegas native dismantles the expectations maintained for vocalists based on their gender, demanding instead that the focus be placed on his agile, fluttering performances. His debut EP, <i>Northtown</i>, is named for the dusty suburban neighborhood where he grew up; it finds Shamir moving back and forth between sweet, almost holy purity and unearthly hysteria over churning, minimal house tracks.</span></p>
<p><span>Shamir is still a new hand at writing and recording dance music; raised on an omnivorous musical diet of rock, hip-hop, jazz, and R&amp;B, the first explicitly beat-driven track he wrote ended up launching his career. “If It Wasn’t True” remains a stunning opening salvo, one that plays on the tension between Shamir’s slender vocal and lyrical naiveté and grimy, threatening instrumental tones before devolving into a chaotic mess, swallowed by a haphazardly firing synth corroding in real-time. It’s a contrast that’s employed several times throughout <i>Northtown</i>, and it manages to retain its effectiveness because it’s so stark and clear, as Shamir’s fragile, yearning voice is pitted against aggressive, hard-charging electronics that actively warp and decay as the songs develop.</span></p>
<p><span>The toughness and rigidity of the instrumentation plays well against his lyrics, too. Shamir spends most of <i>Northtown </i>in a state of constant romantic turmoil, and thanks to the delicacy of his voice it sounds like he’s exploring new depths of disappointment with each new track. On “If It Wasn’t True”, he’s trying to process a relationship that quickly soured, eventually settling into a tenuous but deadened peace; the core of the filthy, pulsing “Sometimes a Man” is his resigned sigh, “Sometimes a man ain’t what he says he is/ Sometimes a man is just a man.” You can picture him rolling his eyes and exhaling slowly while a synth spirals out of control, leaping around like a Roomba gone rogue before falling into a dead-eyed pulse. The volatile electronics seem like windows into Shamir’s psyche: anger and resentment made into ferocious backing tracks, shielding his heartbreak.</span></p>
<p><span>The one song on <i>Northtown </i>that deviates from the distorted electronics first glimpsed on “If It Wasn’t True” is its closer, a cover of Canadian country singer Lindi Ortega’s 2013 track “Lived and Died Alone” that Shamir cut with a single microphone in just one take. Accompanied by just an acoustic guitar, it’s a lonely lament that quickly blackens into something a little more sinister: resigned to a solitary existence, he journeys in the dead of night and excavates a bunch of graves, giving the deserted dead the love he never had the chance to receive himself. It’s strange, surprisingly tender, and blessed with an alien beauty; in other words, a perfect fit for Shamir.</span></p></div>"|19425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19425-shamir-northtown-ep/|7.3|Jamieson Cox

For the first five years of their existence, Tombs felt undecided, a college kid cycling through survey courses while searching for a major. On a <a href=""http://tombsbklyn.bandcamp.com/album/fear-is-the-weapon"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">series</a> of EPs, splits and albums, frontman Mike Hill moved through a half-dozen members (he’s now the only extant original) and twice as many modes, dispatching ideas in search of an identity. Their very good 2011 LP, <a href=""http://tombsbklyn.bandcamp.com/album/path-of-totality"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Path of Totality</i></a>, worked through turgid sludge and distant post-punk, seething black metal and prismatic psychedelia, forcing those forms into inchoate but intriguing shapes.</p>
<p>But <i>Savage Gold</i> betrays no such indecision, from the production choices to the stunning execution. Working with American death metal demigod <a href=""http://www.manarecording.com/mana-clientlist.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erik Rutan in his St. Petersburg, Fla., recording studio</a>, Tombs mostly mustered the heaviest elements of its sound—breakneck blast beats and high-stacked guitars, irascible screams and punishing repetition—for a cohesive, propulsive, and definitive statement. Tombs made the decision to keep it relatively simple on <i>Savage Gold</i>, and that mandate has reanimated the band for 57 extreme and urgent minutes.</p>
<p>Tombs begins these 10 tracks with an ominous groan of organ creaks and doom guitar sweeps, but the lull is short-lived: Drummer Andrew Hernandez II slaps his kit twice and then steps on the double-bass pedal, commencing a blast beat that swells and shrinks but doesn’t actually<i> stop</i> for the song’s first two minutes. Across <i>Savage Gold</i>, Hernandez emerges as the hero, not only guiding the band through its twists between riffs and breaks between verses but also constantly redoubling each song’s intensity. He often sets a pace and then, at just the perfect moment, fills the space between the beats, acts of sudden escalation that push <i>Savage Gold</i> from a series of plateaus into a succession of peaks. “Ashes” nods to Darkthrone, particularly in Hill’s scabrous Nocturno Culto vocal homage.</p>
<p>But it’s Hernandez who does the heavy lifting, switching—seamlessly, repeatedly—between breathless blitzes, stuttering turnarounds and driving, four-on-the-floor wallop. Hill, guitarist Garrett Bussanick and bassist Ben Brand often split the leads and the distorted textures and counters that surround them. They pass the riffs around and decorate them in a way that emphasizes the momentum more than the melody itself. By shifting so much of the movement to Hernandez’s drums, <i>Savage Gold</i> is locked in motion that’s more felt than heard, more intuited than observed. The decision makes the eight-minute ""Echoes"" seem much shorter; the whole record becomes an unending rush.</p>
<p><i>Savage Gold</i> has breaks in the armor, of course, moments where the drumming thunder and the piercing guitars acquiesce to less identifiable, less forceful sounds. The tripwire riffs of “Echoes”, for instance, decay into a slow cycle of feedback, while, just before the end, “Portraits” pulls back on its headlong rush to reveal a gale of bristling tones beneath the beating. But those passing moments—and even the cold, five-minute stare of the album’s only reserved track, “Severed Lives”—serve mostly as setups for a takedown, spreading a calm canvas for the band to soon rip through it.</p>
<p>Just when the electric whorl of guitars at the close of “Portraits” starts to feel almost safe, Hernandez leads the attack of “Seance”, his drums puncturing the reverie as the guitars coil around another militant meter. “Severed Lives” is a menacing drift of hissed vocals and slowly loping bass; after four minutes, it even sublimates into a bowed, sinister drone. It’s only a feint, a trap for the explosive finale of “Spiral,” the radiant and complicated closer that recapitulates the enthusiasm and magnetism of the entire album. Again and again, Tombs mitigate the rumble between a string of onslaughts, tempering one moment only to make the next more effective.</p>
<p>Tombs’ sense of timing, economy and impact throughout <i>Savage Gold</i> suggests the successes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15427-aesthethica/""><i>Aesthethica</i></a>, the second album by another similarly searching Brooklyn metal band,<i> </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"">Liturgy</a>. But Hill has no manifestos, no flashpoint politics, elements that would only distract from his band’s newfound decisiveness and direction. Still, <i>Savage Gold</i>’s energy suggests the same sort of “ecstasy” as <i>Aesthethica</i>, a feeling that also gives it concomitant crossover appeal. Maybe that’s a surprising suggestion, that the album where Tombs digs its heels into heavy metal and works with one of the genre’s bulwark producers might be the one that pushes its reputation farthest afield of metal itself. But you can feel their newfound focus and commitment here, racing through every new crest Hernandez hits or each burly refrain Hill bellows. It seems like a valiant journey through what he calls “Shades of darkness/ Kingdoms of ashes”—triumphant and without trepidation. </p></div>"|19421.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19421-tombs-savage-gold/|8.3|Grayson Haver Currin

So when a Lust for Youth song is built on Norrvide singing “this time he crossed the line” with typical, Teutonic austerity, <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">you figure it's not going to end well for whoever he's talking about.</span> And you’d be right<span>—</span>the song's about disgraced Tour de France champion and lawsuit magnet Lance Armstrong (“He spins the wheels down Champs-Élysées to acquire his seventh title for his people to admire”) and takes its title (“Epoetin Alfa”) from a drug frequently abused in the cycling world. But little else about <i>International</i>’s shimmering opening track resembles Norrvide’s past work, allowing you to hear that lyric in a meta sense.

<p> </p>
<p>If the word “international” instantly triggers a word association with “jet set”, you’re on the same wavelength as Norrvide here. It’s enough of a surprise that a guest spot from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage"">Iceage</a>’s Elias Bender Rønnenfelt on “Epoetin Alfa” results in plangent, pinging guitars more reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5126-studio"">Studio</a> than his own band; the subsequent “Illume” confirms Norrvide’s alignment with Scandinavians fascinated by tropical locales, but he does so without the signifiers<span>. </span>“New Boys” and “Running” conjure the buoyancy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/"">Air France</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5358-the-tough-alliance"">Tough Alliance</a> without the birdcall and bongos, or the subversive playacting.</p>
<p>Norrvide isn’t quite ready to cross the line into the 1990s, though<span>—</span>his ideas of pop are strictly filtered through post-punk, so <i>International</i> is more a logical step forward from his no-fi previous recordings than a giant leap. Incorporating live member Loke Rahbek and producer Malthe Fischer, Lust for Youth are a trio now, and the arrangements of <i>International</i> are at least three times as sophisticated and accomplished; what were previously one or two-note synth figures are now one-bar riffs and full chords.</p>
<p>The crystalline, retro-futurist synths and spotless production could allow for comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode"">Depeche Mode</a>, Human League, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys"">Pet Shop Boys</a>, but that’s if we’re being generous. Norrvide’s not really a lyricist or a personality; he's more of a moaner than a crooner, one who traces the longing melodic lines and placeholder verbiage typical of Bernard Sumner. Though the sound’s more open and inviting, Lust for Youth still remain a mostly unknowable act<span>—</span>the chorused guitars of waltz-timed ballad “After Touch” bear more than a passing resemblance to Def Leppard’s “Hysteria” and render Norrvide’s stiff vocals an afterthought. It shouldn’t be a surprise that the highlight of <i>International</i> is “Armida”, when Norrvide passes the mic to Danish electro-pop singer Soho Rezanejad; it’s still a Lust for Youth song in that it’s centered around the idea of control, but  Rezanejad can sing about<i> losing</i> it, letting go, and moving her feet in a way that would be unconvincing had Norrvide said the same things.</p>
<p>And even if the cold storage atmosphere no longer defines Lust for Youth, Norrvide’s still got his defense mechanisms. “Ultras” and “Basorexia” are perfectly serviceable instrumentals, but they don’t function as interstitials<span>—</span>they just kill whatever momentum Lust for Youth attain with their pop songs, to say nothing of the five-minute spoken-word cut “Lungomare”. Rather than lending <i>International</i> depth, it shrinks the album into an admittedly accurate recapture of top-heavy, single-centered records of Norrvide’s preferred influences. Still, <i>International</i> is Lust for Youth’s third full-length in just two years, so it isn’t likely to be an endpoint, but an indication that they might truly cross the line into pure pop at some point—just, not yet.</p></div>"|19424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19424-lust-for-youth-international/|6.7|Ian Cohen

Post-rock is a genre full of such maneuvers—the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a> family tree, for example, is scattered with one-off projects that flickered into life then ended before they really had a chance to begin. At some point in the 1990s, you could barely pick up a record on <a href=""http://www.thrilljockey.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thrill Jockey</a> without it bearing a credit from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2716-john-mcentire/"">John McEntire</a> or one of his bandmates. It’s possible that Watter is more of a long-term proposition, although its members—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"">Slint</a> drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18538-britt-walford/"">Britt Walford</a>, Zak Riles from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5356-grails/"">Grails</a>, and Louisville musician Tyler Trotter, plus guests Rachel Grimes (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3506-rachels/"">Rachel’s</a>) and Tony Levin (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_crimson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King Crimson</a>)—clearly have other things in mind beside this band. <i>This World</i> is a selection of six instrumentals that plays to their collective strengths, which essentially involves slow, patient builds; acres of repetition, touches of prog-like guitar, and subtle piano and electronic elements that underpin everything at all the right moments.</p>
<p>If Walford comes off as something of an enigma—a view only enhanced by the recent Slint documentary, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3510654/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Breadcrumb Trail</i></a>—there won’t be any further light shed on his character from this album. There’s a faint arc that builds through the record, essentially heading from the resolutely downcast “Rustic Fog” then expanding gradually into the light until the feeling is positively bright by the time the closing title track emerges. But mostly it’s a series of question marks and false trails, driven by music caught up in the divide between simple and complex gestures. It’s pretty, at times, with “Lord I Want More” strung out as a beautifully brief acoustic lament before it dips into murkier territory. “Bloody Monday” picks at the same thread later in the album, illustrating how well this band can settle into a comedown state, but also functioning in a place that furnishes its classicist leanings with something more avant garde, bringing to mind <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundy_K._Brown"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bundy K. Brown</a>’s <a href=""http://www.thrilljockey.com/thrill/Directions/Directions-In-Music#.U4_JApSwKOQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Directions</a> project.</p>
<p>Despite deviations into brevity, Watter is clearly a band most comfortable when working at length, as illustrated by the two 12-minute-plus tracks at the center of <i>This World</i>. “Small Business” is all loops of thickset rock guitar that only misfires when it heads toward an overly familiar loud-quiet-loud dynamic that feels like the band just hit the autopilot button and checked out for a while. “Seawater” is the better of the two longer songs, mainly because it manages to forge connections between industrialized electronics, a drum sound that has the power of Walford’s playing on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>’ <i>Pod</i>, and quasi-medieval plucking that turns into strident rock riffing. On “Small Business” the band sounds lost, but on “Seawater” they're fully in control, carefully picking out where they want to go, using passages of repetition as a hypnotic hook to get lost in. If Watter have a future beyond this album, “Seawater” is the closest thing they have to a path worth expanding outward.</p>
<p>A useful companion piece to this album is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13326-brian-mcmahan/"">Brian McMahan</a>’s earliest work in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1536-the-for-carnation/"">the For Carnation</a>, which was similarly studded with post-rock luminaries as sidemen. On that band's debut, <i>Marshmallows</i>, it felt like McMahan was travelling through a range of material both tightly wound and loosely constructed, all facing relentlessly inward. <i>This World</i> is like that, too, in the way it takes introspection as a starting point and sees how many shades of black it can bash out of it. The difference here is that Watter can see a world outside, or at least form an idea of one and head toward it. There’s hope and warmth in these tracks, even when they’re at their most gloomy. Musicians who work in this field often seem to find it difficult to talk about what inspired them to make music this way, making some of the records even more mysterious than they perhaps deserve. Certainly, Walford has struggled to explain <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19182-slint-spiderland-remastered-box-set/""><i>Spiderland</i></a> in recent <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2014/03/12/murder-ballads-an-interview-with-slint/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a> on the topic. In Watter he’s found another suitably inscrutable vehicle to skew his ideas around.</p></div>"|19360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19360-watter-this-world/|7.0|Nick Neyland

Now it’s like, it doesn’t matter what it is, it just matters that it sounds good.” This is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent"">50 Cent</a> letting his guard down in a <a href=""http://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201406/50-cent"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>humble, humanizing GQ profile</span></a>. Fully aware he hasn’t been the underdog <i>or</i> on top since his indelible hook from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game"">the Game</a>’s “Hate it or Love It”, he’s presumably making a plea for sympathy. If it’s not as off the mark as some of his <a href=""https://vine.co/v/MdAweK9YdED"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>recent pitches</span></a>, it’s close, since it’d be much easier to take his side if he was, y’know, making music that sounds good. 50 was handsomely rewarded over a decade ago for keeping it real, and whether as a rapper or an actor, the only role Curtis Jackson has been successfully able to play is 50 Cent in <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i>. His last major motion picture role and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13700-before-i-self-destruct/"">last album</a> both ended <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byhrYiG9D3Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>about the same way</span></a>.  </p>
<p>What he doesn’t realize is that if Curtis Jackson really “kept it real” in 2014, we’d get to know the guy behind the Street King energy drink, the self-help books, the consistently entertaining ThisIs50.com website, the near pornographic musculature. Curtis Jackson is a <i>very</i> interesting guy and has never been more likeable than he is right now—and unfortunately, Curtis Jackson is nowhere to be found on <i>Animal Ambition</i>.</p>
<p>Here, 50 Cent is ditching the unrepentant gangsta rap misanthropy of 2009's <i>Before I Self Destruct</i>, which was just about the only thing it had going for it. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">But 50’s voice remains one of hip-hop’s great instruments, forever instantly recognizable. He can spend the rest of his life saying basically anything and it’ll sound great, particularly if it conveys any part of the term “fuck-you money.”</span> At the very least, <i>Animal Ambition</i> goes the slightest bit outside of the surgical steel, Beats-EQ’d knockoffs that reliably filled out his past albums (Dr. Dre makes his sole appearance as part of the team behind the antiseptic “Smoke”). “Irregular Heartbeat” could pass for minimal witch house, while the title track undergoes as much as vocal manipulation and obtrusive, blocky production tricks as an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29170-autre-ne-veut"">Autre Ne Veut</a> song (trust, though, that the results are nowhere near as interesting as the description).</p>
<p>Otherwise, <i>Animal Ambition</i> doesn’t exist in 2014 as much as it does in some theoretical plane where 50 Cent has the kind of status outlined in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake"">Drake</a>’s “Tuscan Leather”<span>—</span>“This ain’t nothin’ for the radio/ But they’ll still play it though.” Hard to believe, but there's <i>ten</i> singles that have been released from <i>Animal Ambition</i> thus far, and they range from passable Hot 97 lurkers to passable bottle service bangers. I could go on pointing out the numerous ways that 50 Cent is trying to score a current club hit playing by his old rules<span>, </span>but I think the mere appearance of “feat. Trey Songz” on the tracklist more than speaks for itself.</p>
<p>The anachronism is even more pronounced elsewhere<span>—</span>as far as “name” rappers go, we get <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30225-yo-gotti"">Yo Gotti</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30073-prodigy"">Prodigy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5555-styles-p"">Styles P</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8872-jadakiss"">Jadakiss</a>, all doing their <i>Expendables</i> thing, action figures in a meta-performative recall of their musclebound glory days. We also get plenty of 50’s new protege, the enthusiastically generic non-entity Kidd Kidd, who rhymes “doo doo” with “Blues Clues”, “Mickey Mouse” with “Mickey Mantle”, and ends a verse with “Left his brains hangin’ out like we chillin’.” When all's said and done, Kidd gives 50 the same groaner punchlines as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"">Wiz Khalifa</a> at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>By pretending his access is limited to Uncle Murda's budget and Rolodex, 50 gives this project a high profit margin, though I imagine that’s not what he was talking about when he stated “entrepreneurial energy” as the motivating factor behind <i>Animal Ambition</i>. It’s pointedly brief— 11 songs, 39 minutes and with a scope every bit as limited—and in the album’s first line (and probably the second most memorable), he expresses surprise at being “rich as motherfucker and ain’t much changed.”</p>
<p>He <i>is</i> rich as a motherfucker, and this, in and of itself, is not a problem, as Curtis Jackson rapping about such topics is bound to be interesting. Even if your annual salary is $100,000, you’d have to work 1,400 consecutive years just to match his rumored Vitamin Water windfall. And yet, 50 Cent is so vague and illusory throughout, you’d somehow think he was lying about shit that is totally true; he says he “stack[s] paper like I’m trying to fix the national debt” and that’s kinda funny, but for the level of detail he gives us, for all we know he could be blowing stacks at the Container Store.</p>
<p>Maybe the true folly lies in expecting something more out of <i>Animal Ambition</i> than we're used to from 50 at this point, so a better exercise would be to ask: What would a great 50 Cent album even sound like in 2014? Would it have to be a strict <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin</i>’ revival? An <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak""><i>808s and Heartbreak</i></a>-style mea culpa? A rebranding as hip-hop ombudsman meets political firebrand, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1193-dead-prez/"">dead prez</a> in a higher tax bracket? The answer is unclear, and 50 Cent doesn’t know either<span>—</span>as evidenced by a doddering appearance on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Chief Keef</a>’s “Hate Bein’ Sober” and the G-Unit reunion at this past weekend’s Summer Jam, <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">50 can only impose himself at hip-hop’s center by force and he always ends up looking more desperate than the people he's supposedly doing a favor.</span> There may not be much Curtis Jackson on <i>Animal Ambition</i>, but it does give an accurate survey of where 50 Cent is at right now.</p></div>"|19429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19429-50-cent-animal-ambition/|4.9|Ian Cohen

Afterwards, instead of trying to match or exceed its vitriolic brilliance,  the band angled sideways instead, embarking on a series of subdued, smart experiments—trading instruments, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9548-pussy-cats/"">recording a faithful recreation of an under-loved Harry Nilsson record</a>, and so on. The band recently went on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53165-the-walkmen-go-on-indefinite-hiatus/"">“pretty extreme hiatus”</a>, and the first batch of its members’ inevitable solo albums are now starting to appear; for his solo bow, <i>Black Hours</i>, frontman Hamilton Leithauser doesn’t veer far from their established sound, and continues their exploration of old popular music, this time with an emphasis on what was on the pop charts two generations ago.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>One of the Walkmen’s key strengths were their ability to conjure up an air of non-specific old-timiness, cobbled together from bits of old folk, country, garage rock, oddball '60s pop (which was itself an intentional throwback to the days before rock &amp; roll), and the American songbook. It was an inspired tactic that earned the band a fervent audience among people who cherish vintageness, and the Walkmen were savvy enough to veer far enough from tribute-act territory. For <i>Black Hours</i>, Leithauser dials up the influence of jazzy post-war vocal pop; he recently posted to his Tumblr a playlist of influences that guided its creation, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5095-frank-sinatra/"">Frank Sinatra</a>, Cole Porter, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15999-randy-newman/"">Randy Newman</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>, whose retro-revivalist spirit has hovered over most of Leithauser’s career. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But the playlist seems superfluous when hearing the album’s opening track, “5 AM”, which puts the aforementioned influences front and center with pensive piano, lachrymose strings, and a theatrical vocal performance that accurately replicates Sinatra's signature blend of heartache and bravado. Leithauser’s reedy-yet-supple voice has always been one of the Walkmen’s strengths, and after years of constant practice he’s become a far more proficient singer than you’d expect for someone working in the indie rock milieu. He wouldn’t have been able to compete directly with Sinatra back in the day, but he could have made a decent opening act.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Largely, <i>Black Hours</i>' first few tracks hew closely to the Walkmen's sound, with a few neat tweaks: “The Silent Orchestra” mixes strings, marimba, and a jaunty rhythm guitar playing on the upstroke that suggests ""Mad Men""-era cocktail party music matched with punk raggedness; “11 O'Clock Friday Night” also features marimba, embellished with assorted percussion, jangly guitar, and the kind of casually anthemic vocal part that Leithauser specializes in. The album’s best song, “Alexandra”, is also one of the finest moments in Leithauser’s career, as a deceptively simple melody is paired with acoustic guitar, exuberant handclaps, a gleefully wailing harmonica that smacks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4158-paul-simon"">Paul Simon</a>’s '70s bubblegum-folk sound.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Black Hours</i> shares some of its strengths with Leithauser’s work with the Walkmen, and same goes with its weaknesses—namely, an occasional lapse in focus. “St. Mary’s County” takes a step too far in the direction of Sinatra-style torchiness, while the last couple tracks never quite cohere, resembling sketches of the album's stronger material. But the swooning “Self Pity” and “I Retired,” which puts a cabaret-style slant on ramshackle, mid-period Dylan folk rock, hold things together. At the end, <i>Black Hours</i> is a tribute to a diverse range of musical progenitors. But more deeply, it’s a testament to Leithauser’s inexhaustible stylistic ambition, and his ability to conquer expectations by throwing one curveball after another.</span></p></div>"|19401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19401-hamilton-leithauser-black-hours/|7.4|Miles Raymer

After launching Priests in 2012, they quickly made a name for themselves on the back of their fiery live shows. Even on record, it's not hard to see the appeal; they're a restless bunch, largely unconcerned with polish, careening fitfully from one provocation to the next. Jaguar's deranged-surfer anti-riffs and Mulitz's corkscrewing basslines chase each other like junkyard dogs, never letting each other out of their sights for very long. Daniele's deeply innate drumwork is the cool-headed counterpoint to her bandmates' writhing and reeling. And Greer, well, Greer is just something else altogether; whether she's doling out castigations or on the verge of a crack-up, she's an impossibly commanding presence, splitting the difference between control and chaos.</p>
<p>Sure, their music—which triangulates turn-of-the-80s Los Angeles,  early 90s Olympia, and NYC b-movie-obsessives <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/853-the-cramps/"">the Cramps</a>, if that band spent a little less time at the drive-in and a little more time cataloging the horrors on 6 o'clock news—isn't likely to win them many points for originality, or for that matter, subtlety. But, from the first blast of feedback to the flirtation with light treason that closes it out, <i>Bodies</i> doesn't let up for a second; at just 17-and-a-half minutes, it has neither the time nor the patience for fucking around.<br/><br/>While promising enough, Priests' pre-<i>Bodies</i> releases too often seemed resigned to simple sloganeering, to placing message above medium. Songs about the pernicious influence of television, product placement, and, er, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a> hit soft targets at full force; their passion was never in doubt, but for every point they landed, two more seemed pulled from the pages of a dog-eared Punk 101 textbook. At its best, <i>Bodies</i> atomizes that early furor, a powerful weapon to train on a more deserving set of targets. On ""Powertrip,"" Greer rails against the confluence of authority and condescension; on ""Design Within Reach,"" she's reminding us how often creature comforts place a wedge between the haves from the have-nots. ""Right Wing"" reels off a laundry list of invasive police-state maneuvers; ""Modern Love/No Weapon"" lifts lines from punk progenitor Jonathan Richman and image poet Diane Wakoski as a way of outlining its ""plans to disrupt.""<br/><br/>It'd be reductive to pigeonhole Priests as merely a political act, because things are never quite that cut-and-dry. ""When you are just a kid you want everything to be new,"" Greer recalls on ""New"", ""but you go into an old house, and everything is so scary."" You can take ""New"" as a charred childhood memory or a quick-take comment on our disposable culture; for Priests, the personal and the political are always within shouting distance, but Greer's more explicit commentary is often placed alongside lines that leave quite a bit more to the imagination. Politics are front-and-center on the unusually poppy ""Right Wing"", which kicks off with purse searches and pep rallies. Still, by the song's end, Greer's insisting ""I'm not trying to be anything."" Closer ""And Breeding"" touches on post-Y2K unease and Obama-era disenfranchisement, but its first few lines imagine an Elmer's-huffing teen scribbling something about ""monkeys and robots, monkey and robots"" in the folds of a math ledger.<br/><br/>Does Greer contradict herself? Sure, maybe, and there are times when it seems she's throwing just about everything at the wall in the hopes that some of it'll stick. But political lyrics—or any lyrics, really—need not be coherent to hit home; they've just got to be compelling. Greer occasionally treads over well-worn territory; sometimes she seems to sling her lyrical Molotovs at anything that isn't bolted down. And there are plenty of moments where Greer seems almost pressed for time; the onslaught of interviews Priests have given in the run-up to <i>Bodies</i> illuminate many of the EP's less readily apparent messages, but without that extratextual support, portions of <i>Bodies</i> remain open to interpretation, and some of its more implicit messages occasionally get a bit lost in the shuffle. ""We don’t have a thesis statement for our band,” Greer <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2014/05/12/noise-and-sweat-and-marx-and-chipotle-d-c-s-priests-redefine-punk-for-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told the <i>Washington Post</i></a> last month. “We’re still figuring out what we’re trying to say, so if it’s nuanced and confusing to people, that’s cool. It’s nuanced and confusing to us, too.”<br/><br/>Priests are still a relatively new band, with just a few releases to their name; even counting <i>Bodies</i>, their total recorded output clocks in just about an hour. Given their relatively slim output and their occasional difficulty honing in on their targets, it seems like they've still got a couple kinks to work out. Still, the brash, unflinching Priests just feel <i>necessary</i>; they're just as angry—and perplexed—about the state of things as any of their peers, but unlike those who'd rather retreat into apathy, they refuse to just lie down and take it.</p></div>"|19419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19419-priests-bodies-and-control-and-money-and-power/|7.3|Paul Thompson

Since launching his career in 2001 with an assist from his pals in the frothy French pop duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"">Air</a><i>, </i>he’s laden his albums with the weight of terms like <i>Politics </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11447-sexuality/""><i>Sexuality</i></a>. Even when he’s taking a more personal tack, like on 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16735-my-god-is-blue/""><i>My God Is Blue</i></a>, he still supplies lofty backstories, and his new record, <i>L’Aventura</i>, is no different: the album is supposed to be a musical reimagining of his childhood, a fantasy inspired by the sights of sounds of Brazil rather than the reality of his French home.</span></p>
<p><span>Tellier likes to jump between genres with a dilettante’s flair—in his decade-plus of recording, he’s flitted between traditional <i>chanson</i>, lewd French touch, and completely orchestral composition, with varying degrees of success—so his dive into the rich world of Brazilian music should be taken with a grain of salt or two. To wit: in <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/sbastien-tellier-made-a-mix-of-brazilian-musicians-that-are-obsessed-with-the-sun"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview with Noisey</a>, he admitted that he tried to limit his interaction with Brazilian music before making the record as a means of preserving the childlike naiveté necessary for a genuine revision of his youth. Thankfully, he solicited some help realizing his vision: veteran French musicians Jean-Michel Jarre and Philippe Zdar (of house duo Cassius) participated in the album’s recording and mixing, and celebrated Brazilian composer Arthur Verocai contributed many of the album’s string and backing vocal arrangements. Verocai also helped to secure the collaboration of Brazilian jazz drummer Robertinho Silva, whose percussion can be heard throughout <i>L’Aventura</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>Tellier’s choice to trust experienced, highly skilled Brazilian session players with the fruits of his imagination is one of the best decisions of his career. <i>L’Aventura </i>sounds immaculate, verdant, and rich; strings swoop and fly in the background, cascading around Tellier’s thick baritone, while bass lines pop and rhythms dance with a surprising lightness. These are densely arranged, complicated songs, so buoyancy and deftness are unexpected and very welcome elements. That’s not to say that Tellier doesn’t occasionally go overboard; his liberal application of animal noises wears thin pretty quickly, and his vocal takes always tread the line between velvety smoothness and smarmy lecherousness. “Love”, flecked with jazzy flute and fluttering vocal tapestries, edges dangerously close to hypothetical <i>Anchorman 3: Ron in Rio</i> soundtrack territory, but for the most part <i>L’Aventura </i>avoids such overripe missteps.</span></p>
<p><span>When the album succeeds, its joy and precision transcend any language barriers that might exist; though the album is almost entirely sung in French, its sweeping arrangements and sunny melodies make it easy for non-Francophones to accompany Tellier on his journey through his hypothetical youth. “Sous Les Rayons du Soleil” (“Under the Sun’s Rays”) glides effortlessly, like a boat slicing through calm water; the dark, turbulent “Ricky L’adolescent” (“Ricky the Teenager”), which depicts Tellier meeting a druggy, grumpy 15-year-old version of himself, is a funhouse farce with stabbing strings and funky, percolating synth lines. Listeners who can’t interact directly with Tellier’s lyrics might have to dig a little to optimize their experience with <i>L’Aventura</i>, but it’s thrilling to hear him attempt to pull off his high-concept ideas solely through smart composition and musical skill.</span></p>
<p><span>The album’s most ambitious moment is also its most impenetrable: “Comment revoir oursinet?” (roughly, “How to See Oursinet Again”) is a 14-minute odyssey that splits the album into two halves, moving from spacey synth-pop to soaring balladry and back as Tellier journeys in search of the titular bear, a common figure in French Christmas stories. The song takes a while to unfold and compromises the album’s flow, but its scope and sheer breadth is undeniably impressive. More than a decade into his career, Tellier can’t help himself—he’s still a sucker for the big moment, the lofty idea, the EP-length monolith, and with <i>L’Aventura, </i>he’s done a fine job of sticking the landing.</span></p></div>"|19374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19374-sebastien-tellier-laventura/|7.4|Jamieson Cox

As much a brand as a band, they epitomize the intersection of fame and infamy in black metal. They are co-architects of a sound and style, yes, but they’ve been so beset by the trail of their actions and attitudes that the substance of that sound has often been a secondary concern. <a href=""http://lastrit.es/articles/813/secret-rites-revealed"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Talk</a> about their 20-year-old, still-thrilling debut, <i>De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas</i>, generally doesn’t center on its lurid, feral sounds, the unstable song structures or even the mania of fill-in frontman Attila Csihar. It focuses, instead, on the preceding death of singer Dead and the <a href=""http://loudwire.com/marduk-guitarist-confirms-he-owns-skull-and-brain-matter-from-mayhems-per-dead-ohlin/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talismans cut</a> from his splintered skull, or how a <a href=""http://www.euronews.com/2013/07/16/neo-nazi-and-black-metal-star-varg-vikernes-arrested-in-france-/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">substitute bassist and general henchman</a> came to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ah8sEG9YGo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kill</a> the band’s leader and label head before the album could come out.</p>
<p>There’s also the Nazi skulduggery that came with their reunion, fits of violence offstage and onstage, and the near-constant member turnover. At best, those messes are sidecars for the risky string of records they’ve made during the last three decades; most of the time, they dominate the conversation. Mayhem are the heavy metal equivalent of an incredible, ignominious professional athlete whose record-setting career statistics are pockmarked by a series of asterisks for steroid use, gambling scandals, and generally bad behavior.</p>
<p><i>Esoteric Warfare</i>, their newest album and first since 2007’s scraping-and-clawing <i>Ordo Ad Chao</i>, does not altogether dispatch with the controversy. Yet again, Mayhem has a new lineup: their guitarist of 13 years, Blasphemer, exited soon after the last album, replaced by Teloch, a mechanical but experimental type who played with drummer Hellhammer in the<a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Nidingr/19975#band_tab_members"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> overlooked Norwegian band Nidingr.</a> He's the third key guitarist to play on a Mayhem album; they've at least managed to keep Attila as a frontman, making this the first time he’s ever appeared on two consecutive Mayhem albums.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Though no current member is also a permanent one</span>, Mayhem have existed for 30 years, making them elder statesmen of a scene and sound that's currently reaping the rewards of an international youth infusion. But they don’t play like old men: if anything, the controversy and the instability it fosters keep the band’s music (ironically, the very thing from which it distracts) invigorated by a wide-eyed sense of possibility. All of Mayhem’s albums, for better <i>and</i> worse, have seemed like searching, unapologetic quests for internal reinvention; fables and murders, suicides and idiocy notwithstanding: <i>that’s</i> the reason to care about a new Mayhem album in 2014.</p>
<p><i>Esoteric Warfare</i> isn’t as far-reaching as some of its predecessors, but it’s still an adventurous and energetic record built on stylistic explorations and enthusiastic shifts that you wouldn’t expect from a band that’s had three decades to codify its own sound. They remain, at their core, a black metal act. “Trinity” is a rudimentary convulsion with drums that can’t stop shaking, and guitars that can’t choose between suffocation and laceration—but it’s also the stock black metal song here, and one of the album’s least remarkable moments as a result.</p>
<p>Mayhem are better when testing their limits. During “Psywar,” Teloch almost plays against himself, pitting a militaristic churn with oblong counter-riffs that pull against the momentum. “Corpse of Care” steps gradually from am ominous spoken-word lull into a barbaric grindcore tantrum, shaping the song into an ever-morphing phantom. Everything seems to happen at once on opener “Watcher”, one of the best and most involved songs of the band’s career. It’s a slingshot of hyperactivity, jumping from an all-angles attack to a slow-motion doom lurch and back again. Attila has rarely sounded like such a commanding frontman, either. Within these six minutes, he shifts between a demented yammer and the low-end incantations familiar from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvqpe8muxaU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his stints in Sunn O)))</a>.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvqpe8muxaU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a>He laces between both with the throat-singing ululations that have become his trademark. He’s found a way to make his multiple music personalities collaborate, not compete.</p>
<p><i>Esoteric Warfare </i>is an album of lyrical child’s play, a teenager’s diary of paranoia and petulance. If black metal was born of adolescent hardcore rage, Mayhem has taken care not to forsake that spirit for Thelemic conjecture or ideological manifestos. Instead, Attila writes about the madness of mind control (“Brainwaves in hyperspace, transmitting fear!”), the conspiracies of corporate ruin (“Poison Frankenfood … Forced vaccinations!”), and the arrival of alien overlords systems (“Spikes of electrodes injected into the skull!”).  He worships the restart button of the atomic bomb and, like a misanthropic Tom Robbins, shouts the word for evil from 18 different cultures. Maybe those woes seem pedestrian, but they serve as powerful, primitive fodder for Mayhem. “Throne of Time”, the one about aliens, radiates anxiety with its starts and stops and riffs that continually cycle back on themselves, afraid of what might come with progress. And “Posthuman,” the one about the bees and the food and evolution’s end, stomps through its list of grievances like a child. They pick up the pace in bursts, but Mayhem generally act as Csihar’s hangdog vehicle of existential despair, framing his worry in barbed noise and broken rhythms.</p>
<p>There is one elder aspect worth noting here:<i> </i>Mayhem now chooses its battles wisely. <i>Grand Declarations of War </i>dove headlong into song suites and electronic convolutions. <i>Chimera </i>tested a<i> </i>metalcore edge. <i>Ordo Ad Chao </i>wrestled with abstruse song structures. But <i>Esoteric Warfare</i> feels like an attempt to balance experimental impasses with sustained belligerence, low tempos with unchecked speed. Where there once might have been a twist, there is now silence or a return to order. This is a less audacious Mayhem, then, but perhaps a more distinct and sustainable one, too. After 30 years, <i>Esoteric Warfare</i> is a Mayhem album worth talking about more for its sounds than its associated baggage.</p></div>"|19380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19380-mayhem-esoteric-warfare/|7.6|Grayson Haver Currin

Bret attended Morrissey’s first ever autograph-signing party in Great Britain to promote one of his solo albums, and for such an unprecedented event, the HMV on Oxford Street in London had planned for a crowd of five hundred. Three thousand people showed up. While tossing out his customary gladioli at the long queue of his followers, a badge pinned to his tweed jacket was visible. It read, “Famous when dead.”</p>
<p>The scene’s a tableau straight out of the collective mythological dream of Morrissey fandom. But Morrissey had actual death on his mind at the time, and not just the romantically morbid vision of it he’d been singing about since his time in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths"">the Smiths</a>. Former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a> guitarist Mick Ronson—a hero of Morrissey’s who had produced his prior album, 1992’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18999-morrissey-your-arsenal/""><i>Your Arsenal</i></a>—had succumbed to cancer months earlier, and Morrissey’s manager and his video director both had died around the same time. The remastered 20th anniversary reissue of <i>Vauxhall and I</i> doesn’t reveal the album to be a work of spiritual reassessment in the face of loss, nor some rote meditation on mortality. But in hindsight, it’s clearer than ever that Morrissey—whose self-obsession has always worked hand in glove with a yearning for connection—infused <i>Vauxhall and I</i> with a bone-deep acceptance that aging and dying might be more than just dramatic devices.</p>
<p>To be clear,<i> Vauxhall and I</i> doesn't lack drama; its major fault is a surfeit of the stuff, which is saying something considering Morrissey’s threshold for thespianism. Never a stranger to literary references, he structures “Billy Budd” around the Herman Melville novella of the same name—hardly an obscure source, and purloined with brazen exactness—and “Now My Heart Is Full” isn’t any more coy about its debt to Graham Greene’s <i>Brighton Rock</i>, even going so far as to list by name the book’s main characters including its antihero Pinkie Brown, the archetype of Morrissey’s sexually conflicted, sensitive-bad-boy persona. The two songs are just as blatant in execution: Where “Billy Budd” is fast, forceful, and full of wah-pedal guitar hooks—a bracing break from the glam/rockabilly hybrid established on <i>Your Arsenal</i>—“Now My Heart Is Full” is a sweeping, nearly orchestral crescendo that builds and builds into infinity. “I just can’t explain/ So I won’t even try to”, Morrissey sings, aiming his voice at the angels. And then, as one does, he keeps explaining.</p>
<p>Morrissey’s emotional over-enunciation takes on new dimensions on <i>Vauxhall and I</i>, to mixed results. “The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get” became a hit single on both sides of the Atlantic, and for reasons that are still evident: it’s a sterling pop gem, jangling yet airy, with Morrissey going the extra mile to put the “play” in wordplay. “I will be in the bar/ With my head on the bar”, he croons, grinning at his own deceptive daftness. But he’s also toying with his own public image as a sexless recluse while neatly turning the tables on his hordes of obsessive fans by lampooning the way they might feel about Morrissey himself.</p>
<p>Acknowledging and then tinkering with the very mechanism of fame was something Morrissey had already been aiming at long before 1994 rolled around. His solo career had finally taken off, proving that his early success with his 1988 solo debut, <i>Viva Hate</i>, hadn’t been a fluke born of post-Smiths goodwill. If <i>Viva Hate</i> had tried desperately to sound like The Smiths, <i>Vauxhall and I</i> marked the point at which Morrissey became fixed on a forward trajectory that would occasionally falter but never change. Morrissey was indeed being ignored by the media, at least relative to his platinum-selling, alt-rock-vet contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"">R.E.M.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">the Cure</a>. <i>Vauxhall and I</i> went in at number-one on the British charts, a feat that made “The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get” a self-fulfilling prophecy in earworm form.</p>
<p>What imbalances <i>Vauxhall and I</i> is an overabundance of ballads that border on the bland. A full half of the album—“Hold on to Your Friends”, “I Am Hated for Loving”, “Lifeguard Sleeping, Girl Drowning”, “Used to Be a Sweet Boy”, and “The Lazy Sunbathers”—are musically unremarkable, scraps of patterned wallpaper that don’t stretch Morrissey’s range or imagination into new places the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2684-johnny-marr/"">Johnny Marr</a>’s restless, unpredictable compositions once did in the Smiths. Morrissey’s voice itself is a gorgeous moan on these tracks, textured and resonant, and he explores a broad dynamic of themes, from decadent, morally negligent beachgoers during World War II to piercing pleas for the valuation of friendship—a topic that hit considerably closer to home in the wake of his recent grief.</p>
<p>But guitarists Alain Whyte and Boz Boorer—not yet confident enough to push-and-pull with their boss, songwriting-wise—hang back for too much of the record, leaving Morrissey’s vocal melodies to do all the heavy lifting. Steve Lillywhite’s production is layered and immaculately atmospheric, which fits the ballads beautifully, while also making rockers like “Billy Budd” sound muddy rather than punchy, faults that don't improve even with the solid remastering job the reissue has been given. In that regard, “Spring-Heeled Jim” is the most successful song on <i>Vauxhall and I</i>: throbbing with menace and shrouded in stage fog, it’s a tough, tender, and erotically encrypted character study, perfectly suited to Lillywhite’s shimmer and the stalking riffs of Whyte and Boorer.</p>
<p>Morrissey’s bitterness ebbs and flows like the tides, and it’s rising on <i>Vauxhall and I</i>. His court battle over royalties with his former Smiths bandmate Mike Joyce was still on the horizon in 1994, but he was already sharpening his knives. “Why Don’t You Find Out For Yourself” is one of the album’s best tracks, and one of Morrissey’s most quietly magnificent solo songs: “I’ve been stabbed in the back/ So many, many times/ I don’t have any skin,” he sings, weariness overtaking defiance. It’s a monument to artful passive aggression—another Morrissey hallmark brought to a new level on <i>Vauxhall and I</i>—but the song’s strength lies in the stark contrast between medium and message. Too much of the album melts together into a shapelessly lovely mass of melancholy and reflection; on “Why Don’t You Find Out For Yourself”, rage and resignation are reconciled, or perhaps just deliciously confused, while Whyte and Boorer strum along, gentle yet jaunty, adding a bracing shot of ambiguity and tension. And on “Billy Budd”, the Melville homage is lowered just long enough for Morrissey to mount an attack against—or maybe just a wink toward—the band that made him famous. “Things have been bad/ But now it’s twelve years on,"" he laments, and it can’t be possible he was unaware that the Smiths had formed exactly twelve years before <i>Vauxhall and I</i> was made.</p>
<p>Only one Smiths song makes it onto the live album, recorded in 1995, that comprises the bonus tracks of the <i>Vauxhall and I</i> reissue: “London”, a speedy, stomping throwaway that feels like more of a snub to the audience than if he’d played no Smiths songs at all. The rest of the concert is performed obediently, with just a few tweaks of the studio arrangements here and there to add a little spice—plus a rendition of Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini’s “Moon River”, a chestnut he’d added to his repertoire that he’s never managed to pull off as anything other than a novelty.</p>
<p>The solid live set doesn’t add to the reissue, nor does it fill in any glaring gaps in what’s already available in Morrissey’s live-album catalog. At best, it gives a bit of extra context: In ’94 and ’95, Britpop was on the ascendant, and Morrissey found himself trying to keep up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"">Oasis</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3970-suede/"">Suede</a>—three disparate, competing bands that, at the least, agreed on the greatness and influence of the Smiths. As a solo artist, though, Morrissey never settled comfortably into the Britpop paradigm, which adds that much more of a sense of estrangement to the stoic loneliness that permeates his work, even as he should have been embracing his role as a Britpop elder statesman.</p>
<p>Morrissey is a funny man, but there are few light moments in <i>Vauxhall and I</i>. “I am close to breakdown at life’s inevitably disgusting final summons,” he writes, a bit tactlessly, in last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/150-morrissey-autobiography/"">Autobiography</a></i> while recalling a funeral for a close colleague he attended in 1993, just as he was gearing up to record <i>Vauxhall and I</i>. Nothing like the death of a friend might unsettle one’s stomach. But that’s always been one of Morrissey’s most magnificent talents: not just turning a phrase, but twisting sentimentality itself until it’s sharp enough to sting. The barb jabs both ways, even when that joke isn’t funny anymore. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ownZDWNIRs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Fame, fame, fatal fame”,</a> he sang while in the Smiths; by 1994, a “Famous when dead” badge was one small symbol of how he’d internalized the acclaim that he’d fought so long to get. Besides being one of Morrissey’s most vital solo albums, <i>Vauxhall and I</i> is also his first truly mature one, and flaws and all, it’s as essential—and as perversely alive—as ever.</p></div>"|19411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19411-morrissey-vauxhall-and-i/|7.8|Jason Heller

In the fall of 2010, a three-track sampler briefly made the rounds, and then not much else was heard in the intervening years from the composer/multi-instrumentalist and son of improv legend Bobby McFerrin. Now the album's arrived on Brainfeeder—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>' ever-expanding imprint that has become a haven for artists who consider themselves neither round <i>nor</i> square pegs—there are traces of that original sampler that remain. That link to an earlier incarnation of <i>Early Riser</i> is ""Place in My Heart"", a pleasing if somnolent dollop of funk that finds most of its structure in vocalist RYAT's contributions.</p>
<p>As a straight-up producer, McFerrin has a knack for knowing just how many elements he can balance before things topple over, which speaks to his proclivities as a jazz fusionist; but <i>Early Riser</i> is by no means the kind of affair that'll leave you struggling to orient yourself. The majority of the album passes by in a pleasant swirl, to the point that McFerrin's efforts could be mistaken for complacency. For every moment of undeniable beauty, such as the more recent single ""The Antidote"" and the moving ""Decisions"", there are just as many that feel like closing your fist on a handful of sand. When ""Degrees of Light"" finishes, any imprint it left evaporates immediately with it. Without a strong anchor, much of <i>Early Riser</i> floats away into the atmosphere long before you even notice it's gone.</p>
<p>On <i>Early Riser</i> McFerrin often builds towards an unforseen point without reaching a clear resolution, but this approach occasionally yields positive results. ""Postpartum"" gradually swells, picking up pieces along the way like a musical Katamari; it never quite achieves liftoff, but the slow, exaggerated stretch is pleasing regardless. The aforementioned ""Stepps"" circles higher and higher over five minutes without ever finding a release.</p>
<p>That moment of release finally arrives on the album-closing ""PLS DNT LISTEN"", a necessary jolt of adrenaline on an album that otherwise takes its time thawing out. At its conclusion, <i>Early Riser'</i>s title proves a misnomer—this is an album built for slow weekend mornings spent in bed with a loved one more than brisk, early-morning runs.</p></div>"|19406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19406-taylor-mcferrin-early-riser/|6.8|Renato Pagnani

We're talking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6895-van-halen/"">Van Halen</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22438-acdc/"">AC/DC</a>, Skynyrd, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22828-ted-nugent/"">Nugent</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7321-zz-top"">ZZ Top</a>—bands that binged on masculinity and guitar heroics and made hit records that sounded really good when they were played loudly. They made songs that were ideal for pushing the speed limit, lifting weights, getting in bar fights, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wxAMa3Prhk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">flirtin' with disaster</a>, and for those moments where you <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuyvT8nFMLY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ain't talkin' 'bout love</a>.</p>
<p>This aesthetic void is handily filled by Austin shredders <a href=""http://theobniiis.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OBN IIIs</a>, who revel in their own pose. They once made a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG58DedaWOI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">music video</a> in which all of the members murdered each other for the purpose of stealing booze and record money. On the cover of their new album, <i>Third Time to Harm</i>, frontman Orville Bateman Neeley III is flipping triple birds. They're surly in all their surface imagery, their lyrics are plenty macho, and sure enough, that churlishness finds its way into their beefy sound.</p>
<p>""No Time for the Blues"" is a roaring roadhouse burner that finds a welcome place in the canon of songs for driving way too fast. Neeley blurts a few brusque, blunt screams of ""<i>NO</i>"", and the band tear through a few guitar solos. Drank-too-much anthem ""The Rockin' Spins"" packs a chugging melody and bluesy harmonica flourishes; later, they veer toward Blue Öyster Cult-esque mysticism with ""Beg to Christ"". It's an album heavy on momentum, shredding, and, yes, balls.</p>
<p>But much like the lords of townie rock before them, OBN IIIs pose a specific challenge: although they deliver some genuinely exciting, all-American rock'n'roll music, they require their listeners to clear some boneheaded lyrical hurdles, too. ""Uncle Powderbag"" is as sleazy as its title implies, while ""Queen Glom"" is about a woman who mimics your thoughts, steals your friends, ""borrows"" money, and so on. That song comes across as especially mean-spirited when Neeley describes the woman in question in overly chauvinistic terms (""She'll even glom on to your dick"").</p>
<p><i>Third Time to Harm</i> isn't unmatched in its thrilling-yet-troglodyte outlook—it pairs well with the Timmy's Organism album <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Timmys-Organism-Raw-Sewage-Roq/release/3712322"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Raw Sewage Roq</i></a>, which had similarly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpPYCk-j8QE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sketchy gender politics</a> paired with muscle-headed barroom rock'n'roll. On OBN IIIs' ""Worries"", though, it's hard not to draw comparisons to early Van Halen—Neeley's voice recalls David Lee Roth's baritone register while additional voices echo the chorus in unison. There's also a huge guitar solo, naturally. In a way, it's a shame that <i>Third Time to Harm</i> came out in 2014: in 1980, this thing would've been a mainstay in teen boys' tape decks everywhere.</p></div>"|19375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19375-obn-iiis-third-time-to-harm/|7.0|Evan Minsker

""Growing up African is like you’re in limbo,"" Well$ has said. ""To the white people, you’re black, and to the black people you might as well be white.""</p>
<p>The title of his new mixtape, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/wells-music/sets/mtsyd-the-revenge-of-the"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>MTSYD: The Revenge of the African Booty Scratcher</i></a>, is a reference to the epithet thrown at Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s Tre Styles character in <i>Boyz N the Hood</i>, and an overt reference to Well$'s own struggles growing up as an immigrant. It's an interesting story, but on <i>MTSYD</i> he sounds like an interesting developing artist who doesn't quite know who he is yet. His influences are still too present in his music, to the point where you occasionally hear <i>them</i> instead of <i>him</i>: the muted synths and faraway background vocals of opening song ""Temporary Forever/xxMONOLOGUExx"" are obviously <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>-influenced, and the second half, when the song drops to half-time and Well$ chants in slowed-down vocals, is an unmistakable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick</a>-ism. ""Little Tommy"" sounds eerily like a classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep"">Mobb Deep</a> beat. Occasionally he sounds like a French rapper approximating the Chiraq sound as on ""Django"", an oddly formed, compelling song that seems to have three different beats and at least five different choruses.</p>
<p>His firm, clear voice is a great instrument, though, and he knows how to make it work inside of different-sounding productions. The mixtape is rich-sounding and crisply produced; ""Faux Gold"" has a soured-milk synth line that's part pinched Whoopie Cushion, part sped-up violin.  He's got some dope lines, too—""Just because you rap over classics don't mean you say shit,"" he admonishes on ""Savoir Faire"", while on ""Cercle Vicieux"", he's ""letting [you] know that there's a life outside your mentions."" On the curiously titled ""A$$WATER"", he raps,  ""No cell phone, just pimpin off this land line/ Scared to tell these hoes I got a bed time,"" which is goofy and endearing. </p>
<p>Drake is the strongest influence on present here; ""AFTRMDNGHT"" was produced by DJ Dahi, who produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18511-drake-nothing-was-the-same/""><i>Nothing Was the Same</i></a>'s ""Worst Behaviour"", and the song sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16039-take-care/""><i>Take Care</i></a>'s ""Under Ground Kings."" ""Black Swan"", which gets inside the head of the most wearisomely flogged stereotype in rap --the former ""Daddy's little girl"" that ended up on the pole-- even quotes Drake when explaining how no man could ever want her again: ""Cuz no man wanna hear those stories about his lady.""</p>
<p>Even if Well$ is derivative, he's promising, and the highlights here push against the issue of originality. When he addresses his own life, being teased for being African, on ""Revenge of the African Booty Scratcher"", he finally touches upon something volatile, contentious, and his own. ""My peoples never slaved to that master, but they still think they past us, why's that?"" he grumbles.  The song opens with the clip of the ""booty scratcher"" scene from <i>Boyz N the Hood</i>, and the beat quotes one of the most iconic sounds from the movie: the rolling and clacking of the steel stress balls in Furious Styles' hand as he grimly waits for his son Tre to return home. ""These African-Americans making fun of they roots, like where the fuck do you think you come from?,"" Well$ seethes. It's a startling peephole into something deeply personal in Well$, and unfortunately, there isn't enough of it on this tape.</p></div>"|19376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19376-well-mtysd-the-revenge-of-the-african-booty-scratcher/|6.5|Jayson Greene

To complicate things even further, the singer-songwriter hails from Birmingham, Alabama, which bears the brunt of so much disdain for people who associate the South solely with white racism. Yet, the city birthed a civil rights movement that prized love, equality, and dignity as the foundation for a moral society. On his second album with the Glory Fires, Bains continues to plumb the vagaries of Southern heritage as well as his own mixed emotions toward it. <i>Dereconstructed </i>can be fiercely intelligent, but more often it is frustratingly blinkered; his lyrics can be defiantly blunt, but they’re often elbowed out by music that is dumbly bombastic. </p>
<p>Formerly of the late, great Tuscaloosa rockers the Dexateens, Bains certainly knows his stuff: That album title is a sly reference to the period of Reconstruction, whose policies and practices still define a certain Southern mindset. Opener “The Company Man” hints at the connections between local steel companies and white supremacy organizations, which the knotty history of the area actually bears out. The song’s opening verse paints a powerful image of Bull Connor, who was responsible for some of the most brutal tactics against marchers and demonstrators, sitting proudly in church like he has no sins to confess: “Putting profits in the black with businessmen on Sunday, Monday morning, beating prophets black and blue.”</p>
<p>Other songs confront the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, about strip malls replacing historic storefronts, about the gentrification of downtown Birmingham, about the irony of the Alabama state motto (“We Dare Defend Our Rights”). Bains peppers them all with the kind of Biblical references that add import but no substance, and there’s not one but two songs that crib directly from the old African American spiritual “I'm Working on a Building”. Bains sings it all in a raw bur that ably navigates the syncopated riffs of “Burnpiles, Swimming Holes” but occasionally indulges in some hokey gospel whoops.</p>
<p>As socially progressive as Bains may be, <i>Dereconstructed</i> enacts a direly conservative conception of rock'n'roll, one that is beholden to the past even as they comprehend their sound as new. The Glory Fires specialize in riff-based blooz rawk, and while the idea of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"">MC5</a> jamming with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22962-lynyrd-skynyrd/"">Skynyrd</a> certainly has its appeal, the band doesn’t allow much variation in their guitar attack. Every song is pitched at a feverish clip, but from one track to the next there’s little nuance or dynamic, just a continuous pummeling of staid licks and rusty-barbed-wire distortion. There’s little boogie in these guitars, but almost too much gospel fervor. As a result, songs like “The Kudzu and the Concrete”, “Mississippi Bottomland”, and “Flags!” are uniformly ostentatious, to the point where the album quickly becomes tedious.</p>
<p>That monochromatic musical palette reveals a similarly limited worldview in the lyrics: What’s missing on this album is any sense of empathy, any attempt to see the world through others’ eyes. Every song either explains Bains’ position or imagines a loved one counseling him on his views of local history. That may seem like a minor shortcoming, but it’s what separates <i>Dereconstructed</i> from Southern albums like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15999-randy-newman/"">Randy Newman</a>’s <i>Good Old Boys</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"">R.E.M.</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14446-fables-of-the-reconstruction-deluxe-edition/"">Fables of the Reconstruction</a></i>, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1183-drive-by-truckers/"">Drive-By Truckers</a>’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11080-brighter-than-creations-dark/"">Brighter Than Creation’s Dark</a></i>, which are filled with enlivening and even enlightening characters both real and imagined<i>.</i> By contrast, Bains can only view the South’s problems as they immediately affect him as a white liberal dude, which suggests that two hundred long years of tumultuous regional history exist solely to give him something to sing about<b>. </b></p></div>"|19359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19359-lee-bains-iii-the-glory-fires-dereconstructed/|4.5|Stephen M.

Before he came to be known as the yawpy mouthpiece co-fronting Brooklyn indie rock outfit Parquet Courts, he was one-half of Denton, Tx. duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28047-fergus-geronimo/"">Fergus &amp; Geronimo</a>, where he and bandmate Jason Kelly made the type of reference-heavy experimental rock that was practically designed to catch the ears of rock nerds as much as it was bound to confound casual passersby. Their sense of humor and slavish devotion to past sounds was reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"">Ween</a>, if Ween wrote songs about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZf26Hj4zfc&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">parasitic music writers</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxSNMK7muuE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">trust-fund hippies</a>. 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14968-unlearn/""><i>Unlearn</i></a> opened with a song called ""Girls With English Accents"" (try and guess what it was about); the following year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16903-funky-was-the-state-of-affairs/""><i>Funky Was the State of Affairs</i></a> kicked off with Savage and Kelly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtjRoEHtmJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">doing the best ""'Allo, guv'nor"" affectations they could muster</a>. <i>Funky</i> was a sorta-concept album that carried thematic allusions to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1505-funkadelic/"">Funkadelic</a>'s <i>Maggot Brain</i> while sometimes resembling if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"">Gang of Four</a> covered <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK-b5PLhrEI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Peter Gunn""</a> in double time.</p>
<p>It only took two albums for the delightfully, inscrutably weird Fergus &amp; Geronimo to sound like they were running out of steam, and by the time <i>Funky Was the State of Affairs</i> saw release, Savage had put up roots in New York City and was wielding the influences of his new home in Parquet Courts. The band's debut release, the 2011 cassette <i>American Specialties</i>, featured <a href=""http://nothingmajor.com/features/91-andrew-savage-parquet-courts/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover art ripped from the light-box Chinese restaurant menus that are ubiquitous throughout the city</a>; the following year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17405-light-up-gold/""><i>Light Up Gold</i></a> paired musings about pushy street-team clipboard-brandishers and being stoned in Queens over music smacking of the literate, nervy rock music that emerged after punk's first wave burned out in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>In interviews, Savage <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/arts/music/parquet-courts-proudly-hews-to-tradition.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hasn't been shy</a> about his aspirations to claim a place in NYC's considerable rock lineage. Inarguably, the city hasn't seen a unified, geographically-defining scene emerge since the days of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"">Julian</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"">Karen</a>, so Parquet Courts sound less like a ""New York band"" than they resemble a band that carries qualities that people have associated with New York bands of years past—structural slackness paired with paranoid energy, topped off with a sense of wit that exudes book-smarts as much as it smacks of smart-assedness.</p>
<p>On their third and best album, <i>Sunbathing Animal</i>, they continue to expand their musical horizons by offering more of their own takes on older sounds: there are sonic nods to the spiky energy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"">Wire</a> circa <i>Pink Flag</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a>'s relentless chug, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4341-television/"">Television</a>'s more straightforward moments of elegance, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>'s braying ramble, surf rock's angular riffs filtered through amphetamine-poisoned blood. Most surprisingly, the loping ""Dear Ramona"" comes off as a post-collegiate update of frat-rock luminaries <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7aDstrDMf0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cake's ""Short Skirt/Long Jacket""</a>, swapping the latter's shiny fingernails and cupholder armrests for black coffee and moleskine notebooks.</p>
<p>Above all, the spectre of sly-smile indie-rock kings <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a> looms over <i>Sunbathing Animal</i>, more so in execution than in explicit resemblance. If <i>Light Up Gold</i> carried the dashed-off basement charm of <i>Slanted and Enchanted</i>, then <i>Sunbathing Animal</i> is Parquet Courts' <i>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</i>, a record that focuses more on structure as the band deploys melodic tricks with greater subtlety and precision. <i>Crooked Rain</i> still stands as the Stockton-hailing Pavement's most West Coast-sounding album, and the humidity of <i>Sunbathing Animal</i> similarly calls back to Parquet Courts' Texan roots, its wide-open sprawl sounding freed of the band's explicitly urban trappings.</p>
<p>Recorded over the course of three days, the propulsive energy of <i>Light Up Gold</i> sometimes resembled a quartet of short-distance runners about to collide into each other, limbs akimbo, while reaching the finish line. <i>Sunbathing Animal</i>, then, sounds like the work of long-distance pavement-pounders who have learned when to store up energy, and when to release it. As an album, it's impeccably structured, with the slow-burn cuts placed in just the right places to break up the band's steady crunch; Parquet Courts' newfound sense of control works in miniature, too, as evidenced by the coiled guitar breakdowns on opener ""Bodies Made Of"" and the back half of ""Black &amp; White"", where the band's scraping choogle spins out into freewheeling zonked-out noise before pulling back to reveal a shimmying rhythmic duckwalk, anchored by hand claps.</p>
<p>The increased focus of pacing on <i>Sunbathing Animal</i> means that, at first blush, it's a less immediate album than its predecessor; at 46 minutes, it's a little less than a quarter-hour longer than <i>Light Up Gold</i>, and there's a few extended jams—the molasses-tumble of ""She's Rolling"" and ""Instant Disassembly""'s folksy ramble both go beyond the six-minute mark—that take cues from the anti-anthem ""He's Seeing Paths"", from last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18563-parquet-courts-tally-all-the-things-that-you-broke-ep/""><i>Tally All the Things That You Broke</i></a> EP. The hooks are stronger and more distinct, though, in the sense that <i>Sunbathing Animal</i> registers as 13 separate songs, a change from <i>Light Up Gold</i>'s energizing blur. The guitar work, courtesy of co-frontmen Savage and Austin Brown, is clever and accomplished without being too showy; in their hands, the instruments squeak, saunter, and roar, sometimes simultaneously. On the title track and the album's most aggressive cut, the duo merge to create an impenetrable wall of strings, soloing recklessly underneath each other as drummer Max Savage (brother to Andrew) bashes away in a manner reminiscent of <a href=""http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/994208/animal-drums-o.gif"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a specific, not-always-sunbathing animal</a>.</p>
<p>""Sunbathing Animal"" is four minutes of impassioned fury that doubles as a solid punk tune and as a speed-addled take on pre-Beatles rock'n'roll—but forget the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54804-parquet-courts-sunbathing-animal-video-stars-frontman-andrew-savages-cat-frida/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">video</a>, all you need is the lyric sheet to tell that Savage is singing from the perspective of a housecat. ""I want to flee/ But I can only stare,"" he laments furiously, one of many times that he and Brown get lyrically weird on <i>Sunbathing Animal</i>. The sloganeering and sneering found on <i>Light Up Gold</i> is gone, along with most notions of straightforwardness, as the closest either singer gets to clarity is on the back-from-touring grievance-list ""Always Back in Town"". Otherwise, the lyrics are stranger, more elliptical, less <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5P1SzaJ3jk&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stoned and Starving""</a> and more just plain stoned. ""What color is blood?/ Still the same that it was?,"" Savage yells over the ascending strut of ""What Color Is Blood"", taking on the bug-eyed paranoia of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"">David Byrne</a> circa <i>More Songs About Buildings and Food</i>; on ""Instant Disassembly"", he conflates love, anxiety, and protection before admitting that the firmament containing those virtues is in serious decay: ""There's nothing left to dismantle/ The house it just collapsed on itself.""</p>
<p>Yet again recalling Pavement in their glory days, Parquet Courts remain inscrutable even as their talents grow, a band less willing to show their hand as they are interested in describing why hands are such weird body parts to begin with. The closest thing Savage offers as far as a lyrical clue to the band's general mindset is buried in the middle of ""Instant Disassembly"": ""Turn on the white noise murmur of the AM band/ And the last classic rock band's last solid record creeps in."" The couplet could, in a way, be a joke about the permanence of musical obsolescence—but it doubles as a mission statement, too, as Parquet Courts are a band using the past to write their own version of the present. If you're looking for something ""new,"" you aren't going to find it here, and that's totally okay: <i>Sunbathing Animal</i>'s considered, whip-smart rock revivalism is a work of substantial growth from a band that already did ""simple"" quite well, placing Parquet Courts in their own distinct weight class.</p></div>"|19403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19403-parquet-courts-sunbathing-animal/|8.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

Endearing lines about young love and fond memories are parceled with energetic hooks, exuberant cymbal crashes, and singer Jeremy Underwood’s dogged yelp. It’s an immensely present and viscerally enjoyable album, caught in the moment without a second to spare.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In his Pitchfork review of their debut album, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15627-are-you-falling-in-love/""><i>Are You Falling in Love?</i></a>, David Bevan noted the similarities between Gold-Bears and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a>, another Slumberland alum burying honeyed melodies underneath layers of fuzz like a precious gem wrapped in tissue paper. Pains have adjusted to their upwardly scaled ambitions by toning back the distortion, while Gold-Bears have headed in the other direction: </span><i>Dalliance </i><span>is thicker, as its guitars squeal into a heady, enveloping rush without losing fizzy pop effervescence. Underwood’s voice leaps from the mix, revealing him as another entrancingly nasal pop-punk pugilist along the lines of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4207-the-thermals/"">the Thermals</a>’ Hutch Harris.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are heartfelt truths revealed in the lyrics, but Gold-Bears are most apt at communicating a feeling with just a few seconds at their disposal. “Yeah, Tonight” is packed with knowing lines about what the night might hold, but the urgent refrain says everything you need to know. You could listen to how “Chest” describes a complicated love, or let the wistful harmonies at the end do all the work. A song like “From Tallahassee to Gainesville” sets an intimate scene (”On our way from Tallahassee to Gainesville/ We listen to songs in the dark/ Somehow you convince me that we weren’t really that smart”) before riding a few pregnant pauses and the eternally sweet “Be My Baby” drum beat toward a breathy denouement.</span></p>

Buzz “King Buzzo” Osborne has been faithfully dredging the depths of his own sludge ocean since 1983, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/?"">Melvins</a> established the molasses-in-January pace for waves of grunge-mongers and extreme metalheads to come—but Osborne's always had a way with a tune, and one of the reasons The Melvins have lived long and prospered is the fact that he’s so adept at wringing weird hooks out of the primordial muck. Folk, though, can bring out the stuffiest and most sober sides of songwriters—especially those who are more accustomed to letting the volume knob do the talking. Luckily, Osborne’s solo acoustic debut, <i>This Machine Kills Artists</i>, is a refreshing breath of unplugged, fuck-it-all folk.</p>
<p>The album’s title suggests Osborne obviously doesn’t cotton to the notion of folk music’s preciousness or self-importance. Still, he can play the hell out of the genre: droning, minor-key cuts such as “Rough Democracy” and “Drunken Baby” writhe and smolder, even when they sound no different than what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28049-alice-in-chains/"">Alice in Chains</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28933-the-cult/"">the Cult</a> might sound like in an acoustic setting. There’s conviction to Osborne's execution, even when he undermines himself humorously on “Instrument of God” and ‘Good and Hostile”, where he lets his voice’s cavernous rumble climb into a froggy, whining caricature of itself. It’s all part of Osborne’s long-established sensibility, but without a greasy glacier of distortion behind him, that tongue-in-cheek alchemy sours slightly. Osborne deserves a lot of credit for keeping the album a truly acoustic affair—but, eventually, the skeletal sameness becomes more numbing than a million Melvins riffs stacked end on end.</p>
<p>Osborne's flirtations with folk are, essentially, a lark, but there are moments when novelty is not enough. On one of <i>This Machine Kills Artists</i>’ best tracks, “How I Became Offensive”, Osborne picks at his instrument mock-melodramatically, whispering sinisterly about how this is “no time for violent music”. One on hand, it’s a clever bit of self-subversion; on the other, it sounds like off-brand Ween. There's nothing remotely offensive or challenging about <i>This Machine </i><i>Kills Artists</i>, which comes across as mildly crotchety—and on silly, strum-happy songs like ""Useless King of the Punks"", which is unpacked with a poker face and a wink at its own corny gag, it comes across as downright avuncular.</p>
<p>What lies behind Osborne’s sudden urge to make and a folk record? Melvins have been as prolific and present as ever, and if anything they've showed signs of gearing up, rather than winding down, in recent years. The cohesion of <i>This Machine Kills Artists</i> lends the record a purposeful focus, suggesting that Osborne might be committing himself to this new artistic direction. Whatever his intentions may be, the album is a welcome tangent that opens up room for him to expand his folk faculties even further beyond the realm of the inspired piss-take. <i>This Machine Kills Artists</i> may not amount to more than an odd itch Osborne felt like scratching, but at least he scratches it with glee.</p></div>"|19412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19412-buzz-osborne-this-machine-kills-artists/|6.4|Jason Heller

In other collaborations and in their respective solo work, Carter and Murano have often plundered such <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;ved=0CFAQFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.preservation.com.au%2Fproduct%2Ftom-carter-christian-kiefer-from-the-american-song-book&amp;ei=Y5uHU-SJKOausASW5oAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHl__et3LpAwT9z6s_61nDsDoq78Q&amp;sig2=BFm2dlmqAFm03pbY9HhcOg&amp;bvm=bv.67720277,d.cWc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fables</a> and <a href=""http://decimus.bandcamp.com/album/decimus-d"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">symbols</a> for fodder. Here, they not only attach the names of those mythic flows to each of these tracks but also use them as spirit guides; these 20-minute pieces are singular rushes of gathering and often-ferocious sound, built with guitars that scream and then scatter the blues and electronics that wade through fluid distortion and oscillation. “Phlegethon,” for instance, goes from eerie to irate, “Acheron” from quiet and pensive to clipped and impenetrable.</p>
<p>Despite the doom and the din, <i>Four Infernal Rivers </i>is a wonderfully conversational album, a partnership between two restless improvisers locked deep inside these moments. Carter and Murano are comfortable with one another’s styles and instincts, and they respond to one another as old friends. In fact, for all this talk of fire, these instrumentals feel rather like a set of late-night fireside chats, full of gripes and wit, opinions and ideals. When these four sides have all been flipped, you get the sense that you’ve outlasted the night with these two, aggravated and excited by their strange companionship.</p>
<p>The pair recorded their only previous release, <a href=""http://decimus.bandcamp.com/album/tom-carter-pat-murano"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an eponymous two-piece LP issued in 2012</a>, at Black Dirt Studio, a comfortable space where each of their better-known outfits—Carter’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/897-charalambides/"">Charalambides</a> and Murano’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3049-no-neck-blues-band/"">No-Neck Blues Band</a>—have previously worked. For this one, though, they met at Carter’s Long Island City house for several sessions early last year, congregating around his four-track. Aberrations that might’ve been buffed out in a studio, like the un-grounded amplifier hum at the start of “Acheron”, become subtle charms, intimate moments that put the listener in the living room as a kind of witness. Carter and Murano move past the hesitant and inchoate atmosphere of their earlier work into an unflinching, boisterous dialogue. Passing musical ideas, like the flickering tones that begin “Cocytus”, are taken to their extreme ends. Murano’s gloaming synth morphs into a sheet of caustic noise, while Carter’s shimmering notes spiral into a veil of high-end abrasion. Nearly 20 minutes later, when the track slow-fades into distant silence, you can hear echoes of that introduction, outlasting the intervening squall.</p>
<p>That narrative quality makes <i>Four Infernal Rivers</i> particularly magnetic. These four improvisations evolve and surprise, but they move through their 20 minutes with a sequential logic that resembles thoroughly arranged pieces. During “Phlegethon”, they harmonize, Carter’s piercing, acid-lead guitar slicing through Murano’s sympathetic synthesizer line; it’s almost as if they’ve agreed to meet at this specific place but made a game of choosing their own routes to that intersection. When they split apart, Murano chases a set of decaying beats with damaged industrial tones; Carter, meanwhile, pursues a circular guitar moan, suggesting an incensed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15877-loren-connors"">Loren Connors</a>. They meet again at the end, steadily settling into stillness like the autumn dusk.</p>
<p>Although they play different instruments across <i>Four Infernal River</i><i>s</i>, Carter and Murano allow the sounds of guitar, synthesizer and drum machine to dissolve into one another, often to the point where they seem to come from the same mercurial source. And in a way, they do—from two experienced instrumentalists setting up shop at home, drifting into the same space and coming up for a break only when one side of the record is full.                     </p></div>"|19288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19288-tom-carter-pat-murano-four-infernal-rivers/|8.0|Grayson Haver Currin

That was it: the rest was ringing silence, Lang's careful, mazelike vocal writing, and a quiet mournfulness that troubled and changed anyone who heard it. <i>Love Fail</i> feels like a revisiting, or extension, of that work—it's also scored for four voices, this time the vocal group Anonymous 4, and it also features hand bells. The source water, the English madrigal, is the same. But the temperature is a degree or two warmer, more hospitable to cellular life; the 15 pieces, spread across 50 minutes, touch on emotions closer to mundane existence—the difficulty of communication, the impossibility of remaining in the right. </p>
<p>As with much of Lang's recent work, <i>Love Fail</i> exists in a purposeful, elegant stasis—things change, but barely. His music is, in a sense, process music; you can hear, or feel, the motor that Lang feeds his ideas into whirring beneath the surface. He talks openly <a href=""http://www.wonderingsound.com/feature/david-lang-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in interviews</a> about being an ideas-first composer, one for whom sounds and notes come afterward. But his music always comes out sounding luminous, gorgeous, a reminder that processes are what people make of them. The material David Lang feeds into his processes contains his doubts, fears, bleak thoughts—his, or someone else's—that he is empathetic enough to channel directly into his music. They come out scrambled, but they quickly reassemble themselves in our perception, in much the same way our minds flip the upside down image our retina captures.  </p>
<p>It is this empathy that lifts his music into an exalted, secular realm -- a place where we're forced to understand each other. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18023-david-lang-death-speaks/""><i>Death Speaks</i></a>, he turned the figure of Death into someone beautiful, someone worth loving. On <i>The Little Match Girl Passion</i>, he rendered the slow death of the titular figure, alone on the street, into a gentle transfiguration, like a time-lapse video of a flower blooming. On ""Forbidden Subjects,"" Lang examines a couple rendered slowly mute by an unnamed tragedy: ""Soon most every subject they might want to talk about/ Is associated with another unpleasant scene/ And becomes a subject they can't talk about/So that as time goes by there is less and less they can safely talk about."" The mood is grave, but quiet, and tender—there are dark forces in his pieces, but they don't necessarily hold anything against you. </p>
<p>The complex emotions at the center of ""He was and she was"" circle around regret and loss: ""She was so charming/ She was so lovely""; ""He was an admirable man/ He was so admirable."" Lang's scoring of the text draws the ear to the only word that matter to him in this construction: ""was."" The ""he was"" and ""she was"" are broken up into bits, one simply a repeating interval while another washes whispers of ""hewashewashewashewashewas"" around the feet of the piece. The specifics of <i>what</i> these people were aren't important; Lang wants us to meditate on the fact that they <i>were</i>, and no longer <i>are</i>.</p>
<p>""Right and Wrong,"" meanwhile, parses a series of mesmerizing, unnavigable rules about the divide in its title: ""She knows she is right/ But to say she is right is wrong/ In this case, to be correct and say so is wrong/ In certain cases she may be correct, and may say so in certain cases/but if she insists too much, she becomes wrong/ So wrong that even her correctness becomes wrong by association."" Read those lines on paper, and they drone like stereo instructions. But listen to Lang's setting of this text—two lower voices intoning like intercom beeps, the other two fluttering up like birds scared from a tree—and feel the grace of his animating touch. His mind can turn even the sharpest mental scrutiny into something resembling a loving caress. </p></div>"|19369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19369-david-lang-love-fail/|7.8|Jayson Greene

This was Soundgarden’s long overdue turn to come out on top. Though they were the first late-’80s Seattle-scene spawn to sign to a major label, and dutifully embarked upon traditional career-building exercises like opening stadium tours for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1822-guns-n-roses/"">Guns N' Roses</a>, they would be soundly leapfrogged on the charts by their Emerald City peers in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"">Pearl Jam</a>; by comparison, Soundgarden’s metallic sonatas were seemingly too knotty (and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waX1AGPtyto&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">naughty</a>) to inspire the same magnitude of crossover success. Sure, 1991’s <i>Badmotorfinger</i> landed a bare-chested Chris Cornell <a href=""http://m.cdn.blog.hu/re/recorder/image/chris%20cornell_spin%20cover.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on the cover of SPIN</a>, and an MTV ban of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14r7y6rM6zA&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the allegedly blasphemous “Jesus Christ Pose” video</a> brought the band more attention than if the station had actually aired it, but Soundgarden appeared destined to be the perennial bronze medalists in the Grunger Games.</p>
<p>By early 1994, however, the playing field had changed considerably: Though Pearl Jam were still the most popular rock band in America, they were actively trying to be the least visible one, declaring a moratorium on videos and interviews in an orchestrated (and ultimately successful) campaign to kill their own hype. Nirvana, likewise, were in the midst of a similar retreat, and though their story had yet to reach its tragic conclusion, <a href=""http://ultimateclassicrock.com/kurt-cobain-overdose-coma-rome/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ominous warning signs</a> were in the air. But as a band that enjoyed a steadier ascent than their flannelled friends—and whose records got progressively better <i>after</i> jumping to a major—Soundgarden didn’t seem so conflicted about success. Their response to the Seattle-scene media storm wasn’t to try to avoid it, but transcend it, and embrace the opportunity to, for a moment, become the biggest band in the land.</p>
<p>Usually, it’s a bad sign when the wild-child frontman of your favorite group cuts his hair and starts wearing shirts. But the clean-cut Cornell that emerged with <i>Superunknown</i> was emblematic of the album’s mission to deliver maximal effect with minimal histrionics. With its despairing worldview, gold-plated production, and CD-stuffing 71-minute running time, <i>Superunknown</i> is a quintessential ’90s artifact. But thanks to its still-formidable high-wire balance of hooks and heft, the album nonetheless represents, some 20 years later, the platonic ideal of what a mainstream hard rock record should be. And even if that’s an ideal to which few contemporary bands aspire (aside from, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>), <i>Superunknown</i> remains a useful model for any left-of-center artist hoping to achieve accessibility without sacrificing identity.</p>
<p>For Soundgarden, the push toward pop was the result of incremental evolutions rather than a spectacular leap. Where <i>Badmotorfinger</i> introduced flashes of psychedelia and paisley-patterned melody amid Kim Thayil’s pulverizing riffage, on <i>Superunknown</i>, these elements become featured attractions. The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaSIJrWQeHc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">once-oblique John Lennon references</a> gave way to unabashed homage—centerpiece power ballad “Black Hole Sun” is pretty much “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds” turned upside down and dropped in a heap of soot and coal. That song counts as <i>Superunknown</i>’s most wanton act of subversion—setting its apocalyptic imagery to a tune so pretty, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCaCxg6hv3A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">even Paul Anka can dig it</a>—but if that element of surprise has been diluted by two decades of perpetual rock-radio rotation, the album boasts a wealth of less celebrated deep cuts (the queasy psych-folk of “Head Down,” the dread-ridden doom of “4th of July”) that retain a palpable sense of unease.</p>
<p>Even the album’s eternal fist-pump anthems—“The Day I Tried to Live”, “Fell on Black Days”, “My Wave”—are infected with misanthropy and malaise, making <i>Superunknown</i> the rare arena-rock album that makes just as much sense in blacked-out bedroom. (And yet, despite the junkie intimations of its title, “Spoonman” is really just about a man who plays with spoons.) That said, if you don’t hate the world now quite as much as did when you were 18, you may find yourself skipping over the leaden likes of “Mailman” and “Limo Wreck,” while developing a newfound appreciation for how bassist Ben Shepherd’s India-inspired oddity, “Half”, injects a welcome dose of absurdity into the mix.</p>
<p>By fortuitous coincidence, <i>Superunknown</i> hit stores the same day as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nine Inch Nails</a>’ <i>The Downward Spiral</i>, an album boasting a similarly expansive scope and thematic framework, albeit approached from a drastically different set of influences (’80s new wave, goth, and electro as opposed to ’60s classic rock). The connection between the two albums is strong enough that the two bands toured together in 1994 and—despite <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/86781/trent_reznor_still_mouthing_off_about_chris_cornel/franchises/wheres-the-beef/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">some shit-talkin’ in the interim</a>—are reuniting once again this summer for a joint-20<sup>th</sup>-anniversary jaunt. For casual Soundgarden fans who still own the record, a concert ticket may ultimately be a more efficient way of celebrating <i>Superunknown</i>’s birthday than by shelling out for this reissue (available in two-and five-CD box set iterations), whose bonus material mostly amounts to demos and rehearsal tapes that cast this epic album in a more normalizing light. However, you do develop a greater appreciation for the final product when you hear the ideas that got scrapped along the away or relegated to B-sides, like the dirgey embryonic arrangement of “Fell on Black Days” (a.k.a. “Black Days III”), the free-form ambient stew of “Jerry Garcia’s Finger”, and a club-friendly industrial funk mix of “Spoonman” by Steve Fisk that sounds like a test run for his beat-driven project <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ9JPMMVM4s&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pigeonhed</a>.</p>
<p>You also get a glimpse of the band’s future course with a beautifully spare acoustic treatment of “Like Suicide” that points the way to 1996’s more temperate <i>Down on the Upside</i>, the album that effectively triggered Soundgarden’s subsequent 13-year break-up. But then the go-for-broke, peak-conquering triumphalism of <i>Superunknown</i> was itself a harbinger that the writing was on the wall for this band at the time. When Cornell sings, “Alive in the superunknown” on the album’s acid-swirled title track, it’s both a valorous testament to Soundgarden’s last-gang-in-town fortitude and a telling prophecy of the uncertainty to come, with grunge’s early ’90s stranglehold on alt-rock radio soon to be loosened by the emergence of pop-punk, Britpop, electronica, and nu-metal. But amid a musical landscape now splintered into infinite subgenres, <i>Superunknown</i> remains the very definition of no-qualifiers-required rock—a tombstone for a once-dominant aesthetic, perhaps, but also a solid, immovable mass that endures no matter how dramatically its surroundings have changed.</p></div>"|19407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19407-soundgarden-superunknown/|8.5|Stuart Berman

Their much-adored 2005 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1811-clap-your-hands-say-yeah/"">self-titled debut</a> continues to tower over their entire subsequent discography, but then ringleader Alec Ounsworth seems more comfortable lurking in the shadows than basking in the spotlight. A glance at the band’s current touring itinerary reveals venues half the size of the ones they were headlining nine years ago, but Ounsworth is the sort of artist <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3027329/most-creative-people/clap-your-hands-say-yeah-on-the-value-of-tiny-audiences"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">who’d rather play your living room</a> than an arena. It seems like Ounsworth is exactly where he wants to be, having earned enough clout to, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13582-skin-and-bones-mo-beauty/"">assemble Philadelphia indie-rock dream teams for his solo albums</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/35931-clap-your-hands-say-yeahs-alec-ounsworth-goes-solo/"">live out his Tom Waits fantasies in New Orleans with some veteran funk session players in tow</a>, while putting enough aesthetic distance between himself and that first Clap Your Hands album to ease the burden of expectation and follow whatever whim strikes his fancy. At this point, the ever-resourceful Ounsworth is beholden to no entity, save for the <a href=""http://clapyourhandssayyeah.bandcamp.com/music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> terms and conditions page. </p>
<p>But as Clap Your Hands Say Yeah’s fourth full-length <i>Only Run</i> illustrates, there’s a difference between feeling boundless and sounding rudderless. The album’s conception was preceded by the departure of three fifths of the band’s formative line-up, leaving just the core of Ounsworth and drummer Sean Greenhalgh. Accordingly, in sharp contrast to the streamlined sound of 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15805-hysterical/""><i>Hysterical</i></a>, <i>Only Run</i> has the feel of a band being reconstructed in real time, with an increased reliance on synthesizers, manipulated voice effects, sampled dialogue, and song fragments pieced together like unevenly aligned Lego blocks. The one constant through the CYHSY canon, of course, is Ounsworth’s excitable tremble of a voice, and, on an album-by-album basis (both within the band and without), he’s been eager to recast it in as many different contexts as possible. But <i>Only Run</i> often compacts this catholic approach into the span of a single song, with frustrating results. </p>
<p>While the circular drum pattern, synth-smeared ambience, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order"">New Order</a>-esque guitar lines of the opening “As Always” lend the track an ascendent grandeur that sounds more like a proper Dave Fridmann production than anything on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9820-some-loud-thunder/"" target=""_blank"">the last album CYHSY recorded with him</a>, in the final minute, the arrangement drops out to leave Ounsworth singing the verse melody on his acoustic guitar. It’s a classic songwriter ploy—to prove a tune is sturdy enough to stand on its own in the absence of studio embellishment—and, in this case, an effective one. But when the same trick is repeated on “Blameless” and the title track, wherein Ounsworth’s voice left to float in a desolate haze for extended stretches, the sense of structural randomness starts to feel like a crutch in and of itself.</p>
<p>And like a child playing dress-up with their parents’ wardrobe, <i>Only Run</i>’s impulsive change-ups can result in some ill-fitting looks: “Your Advice” aims for a <i>Kid A</i>-style deconstruction of a standard rock song, but the separation between Ounsworth’s clear-eyed, straight-forward melody and the ambient swirls floating behind it is so pronounced, it comes off like an unfinished remix with mismatched console levels. But even that seems complete compared to “Coming Down”, a trainwreck of a song that smashes together an overdriven fuzz-bass riff, melody-averse muttering, and a door-crashing cameo from Matt Berninger that feels less like a triumphant class-of-2005 reunion than him getting his decade-in-the-waiting revenge against CYHSY for upstaging <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a> on the latter's 2005 tour behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5719-alligator/""><i>Alligator</i></a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <i>Only Run</i> finally hits its stride in its more focussed second half, with Ounsworth and Greenhalgh strategically building upon simple ideas rather than trying to cram them together and see what happens. “Beyond Illusion” is essentially <i>Only Run</i>’s “Idioteque”, a drum-machined strut that retains its twitchy tension even as the mid-song appearance of Greenhalgh’s booming drums offer some levity. And if the unlikely collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2281-kid-koala/"">Kid Koala </a>on the slow-motion sci-fi lullaby “Cover Up” proves anti-climactic, the shimmering “Impossible Request” yields the fully realized fruits of <i>Only Run</i>’s grab-bag experimentation, transmitting the band’s inherent ramshackle charm through an expanded palette of space-age sonics. But, of course, this being Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, bliss and balance can only ever be temporary states, as Ounsworth closes out “Impossible Request” with a promise-cum-threat worthy of being chiseled on his tombstone: “Please don’t ask me where I’m going… I’ll tell you again, I never know.” Though, at this point in Clap Your Hands’ perpettually zig-zagging career course, he need not ask us not to ask.  </p></div>"|19405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19405-clap-your-hands-say-yeah-only-run/|5.8|Stuart Berman

To a certain extent, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are raging inside of </span><span><i>Charmer</i>, </span><span>the Scranton band’s fourth album</span><span>—Adam McIlwee, </span><span>Brianna Collins and Ben Walsh’s harmonies have a glassy, disengaged quality and they’re situated amidst turbulent emotions and turbid guitars. But “equal parts Fleetwood Mac and Brand New” is even more accurate in describing what it was like to be in Tigers Jaw during its recording</span><span>—</span><span>like the latter, t</span><span>hey're transitioning out of pop-punk and emo into straight-up indie rock, and the entire band was split into </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17499-rumours"">Rumours</a></i><span>-esque factions while they made the album. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But while three of the five members decided to quit before <i>Charmer</i> was recorded, they did everyone a solid by finishing the album as a parting gift—which possibly explains how <i>Charmer</i> still comes off like a smooth segue into a new incarnation of the band rather than a sudden, painful break or an awkward growth spurt. Though Tigers Jaw have been around for nearly a decade, remaining members Collins and Walsh just recently graduated college, the standard forum where pop-punk kids are not only expected to discover more “mature” and credible sources of independent rock music, but to completely sever themselves from their past. Fortunately, as with their Keystone State neighbors in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32223-beach-slang"">Beach Slang</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31541-balance-and-composure"">Balance and Composure</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31620-title-fight"">Title Fight</a>, Tigers Jaw are beating indie rock lifers at their own game by maintaining the appealing structural songwriting aspects of their roots—melodic quality control, instrumental economy, and the belief this stuff should be MTV-friendly even if that forum isn’t going anywhere near bands like them.</p>
<p>True, you’ve probably heard the descending jangle progression of “Cool” and the minor key power chord riff of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16787-tigers-jaw-nervous-kids/"">“Nervous Kids”</a> hundreds of times in the past year alone, but rarely presented in a manner where the vocals are put so clearly to the fore, presented as a lead instrument rather than something custodially glommed onto fuzzy guitars. Beyond that, Tigers Jaw use sneaky ways to exhibit their pop smarts. Many of <i>Charmer</i>’s songs work the same riff throughout their entirety, with only small variations throughout, maybe a slight chord inversion or a harmonized lead riff or Collins’ pencil-thin synth colorings. But that one riff is usually so sturdy and easy to build off of, the end result is a song with all hook; while the glowing chorus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16195-tigers-jaw-hum/"">“Hum”</a> only appears once, it’s more of a resolution than a climax.</p>
<p>Those are the aspects of the album that take after the positive connotations of “charmer”: subtly ingratiating, enjoyable in a low-key kind of way. But Tigers Jaw turn <i>Charmer</i> into something more resonant by teasing out the negative connotations of its title: manipulative, emotionally callow, inauthentic. To put it bluntly, there isn’t a single nice person populating Tigers Jaw’s lyrics, and their varying exhibitions of misanthropic behavior are explained in the opener’s chorus: “It’s a cruel world, but it’s cool.”</p>
<p>It could be read two ways; McIlwee is either conceding to cynicism as a natural state or reveling in it. My guess is the latter, judging from his deadpan disdain when delivering lines like “Don’t you wanna be my perfect bae instead?” and ”I’m out in California now/ And Ari gave me his new car/ And all the girls are <i>so champagne</i>.” Of course, none of <i>Charmer</i> should be taken as an <i>endorsement</i>of that kind of attitude, just a depiction of it. People primarily motivated by their sexual desires and loneliness can be self-absorbed and not all that concerned with their effects on other people. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">It happens, and it’s not like anyone on</span><i>Charmer</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> seems happy about it, as its dreary emotional state can be too convincingly mirrored by the music at times. </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">However, those lulls end up creating the simmering tension that gets relieved on “Slow Come On” by a flurry of drum rolls and McIlwee’s vocals just nearing a scream. It’s a chilling example of an asshole revealing his true colors, telling someone who doesn’t turn him on about the kind of person who does—“I don’t even care how mean they are/ So I don't ever take your calls.”</span></p>
<p>When McIlwee yells, “Why am I so cruel?” towards the end, it’s about as close as he gets to a confession or culpability, acknowledging himself as a man who wants the ones he can’t have, rejects the ones he <i>can</i> and internalizes the resulting loneliness as some kind of perverse pleasure. When his affections are returned, the other is seen as compromised for having sunk to his level. Closer “What Would You Do” is a total outlier, detailing a sad, codependent hookup over lumbering funk like a vintage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31-the-afghan-whigs"">Afghan Whigs</a> track, while “Frame You” is just as candid—“You couldn’t leave me alone/ Because I was a wreck and you were the savior type.”</p>
<p>All of which makes lead single “Hum” very misleading in retrospect. For one thing, it’s the sole track where Collins takes the lead. Also, when she sings, “You left a permanent scar”, the unforgettable reminiscences of basement shows and long walks home sound like positive nostalgia, or at least a romantic thought amidst the absorbing and near-constant anti-romanticism. Though it’s laced with ""Twin Peaks"" references, <i>Charmer</i> ends up sounding more influenced by another example of<i> uber</i>-90s television—the one where people stop being polite and start getting real.</p></div>"|19428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19428-tigers-jaw-charmer/|7.1|Ian Cohen

The set is comprised of 19 songs from Ned Doheny’s three albums from the 1970s, seeded with demos and alternate takes featuring some of his more famous friends. There are no hits per se, but songs that should have—and likely could have—been hits. Scion of oil barons for whom L.A. streets and beaches have been named, Edward “Ned” Doheny was part of the SoCal scene of singer-songwriters couch-jumping around the canyon and dreaming of stardom. He came from extreme wealth, but that only seems to have reinforced his desire to succeed as a pop musician: to prove himself as an artist instead of an heir.</p>
<p>He was one of the first signees to Asylum Records, but the label spent his mastering budget to market Jackson Browne’s debut. After Doheny raided his trust fund to finish the songs, the album flopped unspectacularly. So did his follow-up, <i>Hard Candy</i>, in 1976. So did <i>Prone</i> in 1979. Still, some of his songs were hits for other performers (such as “Get It Up for Love”, which Tata Vega rode into the top 20), and his LPs are doggedly pursued by vinyl collectors and crate diggers.</p>
<p>Pretty much every song Doheny ever recorded or released classifies as a rarity, which means for most listeners <i>Separate Oceans </i>will be an introduction into his sun-drenched world. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5861-numero-group/"">The Numero Group</a> has certainly timed the release perfectly: these songs are summer jams from an alternate universe where the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22835-eagles/"">Eagles</a> slid quietly into obscurity and Asylum had the good sense to shill for <i>Ned Doheny</i> instead of <i>Jackson Browne</i>. The music sounds like it’s been preserved in amber, so sharply redolent of the time and place of its creation. It’d be too easy to dismiss these songs as “yacht rock”, a recently coined term that sounds satirical and derisive. In the <i>Separate Oceans</i> liner notes, Numero co-founder <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11494-ken-shipley/"">Ken Shipley</a> defers to the phrase “marina pop”, which is arguably more precise and certainly softer in tone, and ""beach funk"" might be an even more apt descriptor. These songs percolate casually, with spry guitars and beachball basslines cohering into superlatively breezy grooves.</p>
<p>It helps that Doheny is blessed with a voice like a lens flare, and his guitar playing, a style combining folky strums and classical dexterity, is nimble and creative. Even the slower tracks, like “A Love of Your Own” (co-written with Average White Band's Hamish Stuart), sound aggressively chipper, and the lyrics never tax your brain. In fact, these songs can sometimes be mesmerizingly meaningless, as Doheny crafts lyrics from stray clichés and non sequitur platitudes. “Don’t you be afraid to give your heart/ You never know until you try it!” he advises on “A Love of Your Own”. Rhyme typically takes precedence over meaning. As he explains on “When Love Hangs in the Balance”, “You can’t let it slide/ It can’t be denied.”</p>
<p>It’s not like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6482-jackson-browne/"">Browne</a> or the Eagles were deft wordsmiths either, so the lyrical vacuousness of Doheny’s music only identifies him as a product of his scene. An excessive headiness might weigh these songs down and rob them of their weightless quality, so it's good that <i>Separate Oceans</i> is aerodynamic to a fault, sequenced to emphasize the craft behind the music itself. Numero frontloads the set with finished studio takes in all their luxuriant glory, showcasing Doheny’s ear for prismatic melodies and sophisticated arrangments, so side A of this double LP doubles as a revealing SoCal pop artifact and a near-perfect summer EP for 2014.</p>
<p>As the comp progresses, the demos strip away some of the veneer just enough to show the creative decisions Doheny was making. The plush “Get It Up for Love” burbles with futuristic synths and a playfully jazzy piano riff, and the song’s punchline is right there in the title—the best and cleverest line written by this self-described “avatar of casual vulgarity”—but it takes on new gravity on the demo version of the song, which closes <i>Separate Oceans</i>. Doheny struggles to get the tone right. Is the song flippant? Serious? Both? Ultimately, all that matters is his jittery strumming, as sharp and directed as ever.</p>
<p>During the comp’s second half, it’s not hard to detect some rain clouds on the horizon, threatening to intrude on Doheny’s sunny-day pop. “I Know Sorrow” is exactly as blunt as its title suggests, paring complex emotions down to those three simple words. It might be too heavy, too unwieldy—at least on this collection—were it not for that high-flying piano jam on the coda, which sounds rambunctious and even joyful. That sense of creativity and musical invention staves off melancholy and self-absorption, even as it becomes clear that the music business has hurt Doheny much more than any lover ever could. “That old rock and roll will break your heart,” he sings on “Fineline”, “or make you whole.” To his considerable credit, he sounds like half a man on these songs. </p></div>"|19416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19416-ned-doheny-separate-oceans/|7.9|Stephen M.

There's both an agelessness and a versatility to his soulful inflections that makes his voice too nebulous to evoke anything specific enough that would scan as direct nostalgia. So once you get rid of any feeling that you might be listening to something reminiscent of another time—admittedly, a feeling fueled by the fact that the golden era of Southern R&amp;B is when he first built his chops—it's replaced by the impact of hearing a lifer professional doing his thing at what seems like a continuous peak.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If there's any downside to longtime consistency, it's that surprise gives way to reliability, so his new album, </span><i>Emma Jean</i><span>, isn't really a huge revelation. And it doesn't need to be: after the previous albums Fields did with his band the Expressions, starting with his late '90s revival and his Brooklyn-borne run on the Desco, Soul Fire, and Truth &amp; Soul labels, it's simply another notch in a heavily hash-marked belt. But any opportunity to revel in Fields' voice is a good one, especially when his voice is so rangy. While he was acknowledged at times in the past as a sort of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a> soundalike, his points of comparison render him more original the wider they're spread out. The gravelly warmth of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10286-bobby-womack/"">Bobby Womack</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5721-otis-redding"">Otis Redding</a>'s emotive ache, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29028-syl-johnson/"">Syl Johnson</a>'s sweet intensity—and, sure, Mr. Dynamite's raspy authority—are more points of triangulation than direct references, with a nuanced vitality that makes his sixties sound like most artists' thirties.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>With a band that can (and should) get away with releasing purely instrumental editions of their work—which the Expressions did, on 2012's </span><i>Faithful Man—</i><span>Fields can really bring it on home. There's one notable example on </span><i>Emma Jean</i><span>, the dawn-of-disco 4/4 conga thump of ""All I Need,"" that goes on for a bit before it becomes apparent that Fields isn't coming in anytime soon—and the instrumental melody, a canny blend of stinging guitar and creeping horns, carries nearly as much lively soul-stirring lead-attraction status as the headlining artist does when he finally lets out a few wordless, last-minute moans at the end. The Expressions are a who's-who of session players and all-stars that've helped make up the sprawling, definitive nucleus of Brooklyn soul, but they're still finding new, appealing routes through it; the countrypolitan twang to their cover of JJ Cale's ""Magnolia"" and the humid, Afro-Latin War-isms of ""In the Woods"" are odd little inflections that flavor the familiar approach without pulling it too far out of bounds.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All that travelling goes into an album with a wistful, set-adrift emotional impact that lingers, even when the words don't. The try-to-work-it-out pleas in ""Just Can't Win"" or the breakup finality of ""Paralyzed"" don't read like much when they're written down, but the words are only a third of the definition where this record's concerned. Thematically, <i>Emma Jean</i> is a record that's front-to-back frustration instilled with the anxiety of loneliness and alienation—the wishes expressed in the song titles of ""Eye to Eye"", ""Talk to Somebody"", and ""Standing By Your Side"" aren't easily attainable, but Fields and the Expressions don't wallow or kick at the dirt. They push up tempos, channel low-down feelings into high-up catharsis, and make sure every punch connects. Even though you know just what you should be getting from an album like this, Lee Fields &amp; the Expressions play like the stakes have never been higher: they lay it all out there, put it on the line, and make damn well sure you </span><span>feel </span><span>it.</span></p></div>"|19304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19304-lee-fields-the-expressions-emma-jean/|7.5|Nate Patrin

Because unlike previous insurrectionists-turned-inside-operatives like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash"">the Clash</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3552-refused"">Refused</a>, Fucked Up’s message isn’t political.</p>
<p>Rather, Abraham is hardcore's ?uestlove, a burly, gregarious, and eloquent music nerd maintaining a likable “What am I doing here?” outlook regardless of his successes, fixated on making the State of the Art as important as the State of the Union. Coincidentally, <i>Glass Boys</i> is similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"">the Roots</a>’ most recent album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19332-the-roots-and-then-you-shoot-your-cousin""><i>...And Then You Shoot Your Cousin</i></a><span>—</span>a relatively compact, dense piece of metacriticism taking an unsparing look at the genre of its creators and its social mores. The problem is that its message is also far more developed and interesting than the medium.</p>
<p><i>Glass Boys</i> clocks in at 10 songs and 43 minutes, a canny move that preemptively neutralizes backlash or skepticism that would’ve arisen had Fucked Up tried to top 2011’s hour-plus rock opera<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15513-david-comes-to-life/"">David Comes to Life</a></i> in any measurable way. It’s obvious that the aspirational Abraham conceded to guitarist/producer Mike Haliechuk’s desire to make a record befitting a “normal band.” And yet, with no ostensible “plot” and Abraham as the only recurring character, <i>Glass Boys</i> is more complex and thought-provoking than its predecessor. Most of the time, it’s like a Talkhouse piece-on-tape, with insider intel regarding art vs. commerce, nostalgia vs. forward thinking, individual vs. community, and why we have to frame these things as dichotomies to begin with. So make no mistake, this is heady stuff: while Abraham pours mulch and gravel all over his florid poetry (""Rejuvenations ocean spume perfume""), <i>Glass Boys</i> alludes to the patronage system, Greek mythology, primitive ritualism, pre-verbal communication, and basically everything short of the <i>2001 </i>monolith to present Fucked Up as a tiny blip in the eternal timeline.</p>
<p>For all of its discourse and rhetoric, <i>Glass Boys</i> remains a very personal work and, more crucially, one that doesn’t preach or provide answers —though Eurycles pops up in a cameo, the album's inquisitive, open-ended discussion is more influenced by Socrates.  In opener “Echo Boomer”, Abraham gives voice to Haliechuk’s reminiscence of being a 15-year old mesmerized by the possibilities of music. But by the penultimate “The Great Divide”, he looks back puzzled and guilt-ridden, wondering if youth is wasted on the wasted youth who put their faith in bands like Fucked Up rather than something greater (“We ushered in all that corrupts/ Now we’re drowning in the glut”). In between, Abraham and Haliechuk cop to confessional songwriting as a ""Jesus Christ Pose""-style farce (“Paper the House”) and spitefully air grievances (“Led By Hand”), before ultimately accepting their fate as part of the continuum as an honor. After all, if an echo booms and no one hears it, did it even happen?</p>
<p>These are conversations worth having, and you can have them simply by reading the lyrics sheet, watching the videos, and reading interviews with the band. For all the talk of Fucked Up getting streamlined and concise, it turns out that streamlined, concise songs are nowhere near as interesting as their wildest, most highfalutin concepts; <i>Glass Boys</i> finds a Great Punk Band making a Good Rock Record that’s weirdly superfluous.</p>
<p>And let’s be clear, this is a <i>rock</i> band, increasingly a hardcore-derived version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady"">the Hold Steady</a>, with static classic rock riffage serving as a platform for functional, verbose one-note vocals (the Van Halen-evoking “The Art of Patrons” could even be swiped from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3977-separation-sunday/""><i>Separation Sunday</i></a>). On their early breakthroughs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9982-hidden-world/""><i>Hidden World</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12320-the-chemistry-of-common-life/"">the Chemistry</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12320-the-chemistry-of-common-life/""> of Common Life</a></i>, Fucked Up set themselves apart not by pushing hardcore in a new direction so much as completely blowing it wide open in a manner unseen since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14330-the-shape-of-punk-to-come-a-chimerical-bombation-in-12-bursts-deluxe-edition/""><i>The Shape of Punk to Come</i></a> or even <i>Zen Arcade</i>. But now, Fucked Up have channeled all of their symphonic ambitions for the sole purpose of making <i>Glass Boys</i> sound like it has as many overdubs as a record four times its length.</p>
<p>That’s literally the case as far as the drums go: Jonah Falco is playing four different drum tracks throughout <i>Glass Boys</i>, another example of Fucked Up’s delightful, crackpot scheming<span>—</span>it’s a cool idea that no punk band would pursue, either out of economic hardship or just the innate knowledge that playing four drum tracks at the same time might detract from the visceral impact of the music. There’s even more of a homogenizing effect on the guitars; rather than contributing contrast, melody, dynamics or texture, it’s the kind of indiscriminate layering that appeared on <i>Be Here Now</i> and <i>MACHINA/Machines of God</i>, turning a presumably hard-hitting rock record into a gelatinous ooze that surrounds and consumes the listener rather than attacking their ears. Though less so than on <i>David Comes to Life</i>, Abraham remains omnipresent and indistinct, a grit amidst a sound that emanates like toothpaste.</p>
<p>At times, the saturation of <i>Glass Boys</i> creates a wonderful, psychedelic effect<span>—</span>“Echo Boomer” is possibly meant to describe Abraham and Fucked Up as reverberations of a punk rock Big Bang, though it’s every bit as applicable to the actual sound of the song. Meanwhile, “Touch Stone” is an aural illusion where a two-chord modulation sounds like it’s endlessly, upwardly cresting.  Combined with the spirited call-and-response of “Sun Glass”, the opening salvo of <i>Glass Boys</i> bears the promise of everything a direct and hook-filled Fucked Up album could be. But after “Warm Change” unravels into aimless guitar soloing and panned drums, Fucked Up usher in a second half that fails to distinguish itself in any way. Once again, there are guest vocalists supplementing the symphonic guitars<span>—</span>the credits lists cred-deficient Canucks such as Tragically Hip’s Gord Downie and Alexisonfire’s George Pettit, as well as indie heroes J. Mascis and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile"">Kurt Vile</a>; with the exception of Mascis’ donkey bray on “Led By Hand”, they’re all just faint echoes struggling to be heard.</p>
<p><i>Glass Boys </i>is a record dense with metacommentary, so it's possible that the record's claustrophobic production is meant to reflect Abraham and Haliechuk’s concerns about the walls closing in on Fucked Up. They’ve been deferential and self-effacing about their legacy, admitting they’ve lasted about a decade longer than even most successful hardcore bands. But they opted out of actual hardcore long ago; since signing with Matador, the genre has served as a theoretical control group for Fucked Up, something to compare the results of their experiments. Now, you can only hear faint echoes of their past greatness underneath the lard-laden production; it’s something that will please the fanbase Fucked Up have deservedly built and enrage the younger, angrier hardcore bands who will dismantle and try to improve on it, fueled by their own ideals and self-belief, however foolish it may seem in retrospect. Which actually validates <i>Glass Boys</i>’ ideas about hardcore's cycle of life—it just doesn’t make the music any more thrilling.</p></div>"|19400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19400-fucked-up-glass-boys/|7.0|Ian Cohen

The suburban-Chicago quintet chugged through the first verse of their single “Who Needs You” without incident—but by the second verse, frontman Mario Cuomo (no, not <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Cuomo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that one</a>) stopped singing as if defying some non-existent CBS lip-sync policy, splayed himself across the floor in front of his monitors to perform a couple of yoga bridge poses, and curled up on the couch to become Dave’s most non-communicative guest since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRb_3hCa72Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joaquin Phoenix</a>. If the point of the spectacle was to show just how little they give a fuck about impressing the public, it failed miserably: not only did Dave and Paul Shaffer enthusiastically applaud the performance, they begged the befuddled band to keep playing, before Shaffer just <a href=""http://youtu.be/SJ9RXe4nn8E?t=4m38s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">took matters into his own hands</a>. In that moment, you can see the daunting challenge the Orwells are up against: to authentically reinvigorate a style of music that, after nearly 50 years of perpetual garage-rock revivals, can now be so easily neutered into geezer-embraced showbiz shtick.</p>
<p>Still not old enough to legally drink in most states but old enough to go to war, the Orwells are fully aware they’re reinventing a wheel that’s been essentially worn down to the rim. As if the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/"">Black Lips</a>-inspired juvie-punk of their 2012 debut, <i>Remember When</i>, didn’t make their allegiance to snot-rock tradition obvious, the album was laced with samples of old Elvis interviews and 1950s-era preachers railing against the delinquent effects of rock ‘n’ roll. (Interim B-sides, meanwhile, were given titles like “Open Your Eyes (A Misfits Ripoff)”.) The King connection continues with the band’s first major-label outing, <i>Disgraceland</i>, though this time, the Orwells clearly have loftier ambitions than cracking the Rust Belt garage circuit. With the alt-rock production dream team of Dave Sitek, Chris Coady, and Jim Abbiss behind the boards, the goal appears to be nothing less than supply their generation with an <i>Is This It</i> to call their own—<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">a midwest-slacker answer to the sort of urbane, effortlessly cool rock ‘n’ roll records </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> stopped making 10 years ago.</span></p>
<p>For their part, the Orwells have cleaned up their act quite nicely, scraping away the surface scuzz to foreground Matt O’Keefe and Dominic Corso’s radiant but not-too-glossy guitar lines, while filling out their sound just enough to justify the big-budget production. Cuomo’s lyrical concerns, however, remain as puerile as ever—<i>Disgraceland</i> essentially constitutes a repetitive <i>Groundhog Day</i>-esque cycle of boozin’ and cruisin’ for “a handful of ass.” Not graced with an especially melodic voice, Cuomo doesn’t so much sing his songs as barge into them—on “Norman,” the chasm between his belligerent delivery and the song’s “Just Like Honey”-ed sway is so wide that it's like he’s doing karaoke to his own band. But Cuomo knows how to exploit his limited range to rousing effect, from the Jim Morrison-esque howls that give the simmering psyched-out eruptions of “The Righteous One” some extra heat, to the excitable anti-authoritarian kiss-offs that transform “Who Needs You” into the Orwells’ own “Last Nite” (in the no-tomorrow, rather than yesterday-evening, sense).</p>
<p>“Who Needs You” is also one of a handful of songs here that hints at another of Cuomo’s favorite indulgences—firearms—betraying the more sinister side to modern-day teenage kicks. As he admits at one point, “My daddy’s got a 12-gauge/ I hope I don’t find it,” an uncannily topical line that’s all the more striking given that it pops up in “Gotta Get Down”, an upbeat bubble-grunge highlight that proves, even if the Orwells don’t become the next Strokes, there’s no shame in being a 21st-century <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDkhl-CgETg&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spacehog</a>. Ultimately, they're at their most engaging when maintaining an ironic distance between subject matter and tone: in contrast to the song’s congenial jangle, “Bathroom Tile Blues” sees Cuomo already expressing his ennui toward a hotel-trotting, model-shagging rock-star lifestyle he has yet to actually achieve. But <i>Disgraceland</i> also proves there’s a fine line between writing songs about being bored and just being boring: the atypically stern lead single “Let It Burn” is nihilism-by-numbers with a hookless chorus, while “Dirty Sheets” offers nothing more than love-’em-and-leave-’em lechery. And yet, in contrast to the instant messianic complex so many would-be rock saviors seem to acquire, Cuomo is refreshingly honest about his band’s shortcomings. As he sings, “From the east and to the west, we ain’t the worst, we ain’t the best.” By that measure, <i>Disgraceland</i> is truth in advertising.</p></div>"|19417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19417-the-orwells-disgraceland/|6.2|Stuart Berman

On the heels of the <i>Workbook</i> reissue comes <i>Beauty &amp; Ruin</i>, Mould's eleventh solo album and his second with the monstrous rhythm section of bassist Jason Narducy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3998-superchunk/"">Superchunk</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2845-the-mountain-goats/"">Mountain Goats</a> drummer Jon Wurster. By all accounts, Mould is on a roll: His 2011 autobiography, <i>See a Little Light</i>, went past being an illuminating read to the point where it felt like a work of catharsis for its author. Mould spent so much of his adult life clashing with former bandmates, struggling with his homosexuality, and groping toward a musical identity distinct from Hüsker Dü without alienating the large percentage of his fanbase that will always prefer the Mould of days past: distorted, angst-ridden, and swinging sword-sized hooks.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16981-silver-age/""><i>Silver Age</i></a><i> </i>from 2012 was as much of a capitulation as a triumph; it gave long-tolerant Mould fans the rush of rock riffs and burst blood vessels that had been largely absent since the breakup of Mould’s '90s-alt-rock powerhouse Sugar, but it also came across as Mould taking the path of least resistance, since his time with Hüsker Dü will always press down on him. So <i>Beauty &amp; Ruin </i>feels like an extension of <i>Silver Age</i>’s impassioned buzz and thrust; less fortunately, it’s more of an appendix than a sequel.</p>
<p>Still, an appendix to the vigorous <i>Silver Age</i>—or even to Mould’s career up to this point—isn’t anything to sneeze at. Accordingly, the trio punches the clock with a vengeance on the punky eruptions “Kid With Crooked Face” and “Hey Mr. Grey”, a pair of tracks that circle back to Hüsker Dü’s SST days. “Kid With Crooked Face”, corrosive and supersonic, could even pass as a long-lost <i>Metal Circus</i> outtake, only tightened and cleaned up considerably. And on “Hey Mr. Grey”, Mould goes so far as to echo <i>Flip Your Wig</i>’s “Hate Paper Doll”, even if it feels more like an unintentional lapse into familiar phrasing and melody than some kind of homage to his past.</p>
<p>That said, there’s no denying that “I Don’t Know Anymore” is cut from the same cloth as Hüsker Dü’s “I Apologize” and Sugar’s “If I Could Change Your Mind"", and the similarity goes deeper than the song titles. For all of Mould’s experimentation over the past twenty years—a hit-or-miss penchant for reinvention that encompasses everything from chamber-folk to electronica—<i>Beauty &amp; Ruin</i> sticks to just a handful of well-worn gears. On “I Don’t Know Anymore”, he hews to the sound he once tried so strenuously to outrun: the bittersweet, fuzz-fueled, pop-punk open letter to the object of his angst. This latest iteration of that formula ranks up there with his catchiest, but it also comes across like a numbingly comfortable rehash of Mould’s tuneful discomfort.</p>
<p>Nothing on <i>Beauty &amp; Ruin</i> truly resembles experimentation, as Mould, unburdened of so much baggage of late, seems joyously unconcerned with proving anything to anyone other than the fact that he can still craft hook after hook. “Little Glass Pill” opens with a airy folk intro before plowing straight into a bleary-eyed, Sugar-style rager, while “Forgiveness” feels forced in both its ham-fisted jangle and its stiff attempt to add some small amount of textural dynamic to the album. Thankfully, ""Forgiveness"" is the only track here that feels disposable, although “Let the Beauty Be” and “Fix It” come close; the back-to-back songs usher out <i>Beauty &amp; Ruin</i> on a sentimentally gooey note that finds Mould content to mouth banalities like “It won’t seem so bad” and “Time to fill your heart with love”.</p>
<p>Mould may have largely emptied himself of the venom that’s filled him for decades, but when needed, he still taps into enough of that old poison to infuse “Low Season” with a churning, <i>Black Sheets of Rain </i>moodiness and “Fire in the City” with some inspired chord changes and wrenching twists of power-pop desperation. On the rousing “The War”, he plies one of the most predictable riffs of his career while singing, “Listen to my voice/ It’s the only weapon I kept from the war.” Of course, that’s not true: after so many years of pummeling at everything and everyone, himself included, he’s found a measure of acceptance—but he’s also kept his brass knuckles on, just in case.</p></div>"|19404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19404-bob-mould-beauty-ruin/|7.3|Jason Heller

The album, a treatise on house music, goes lengths to debunk the myth that house music is/was an all-accepting, pan-cultural utopia—that house music is for everyone. She does this, however, while offering up a deep house sound so sumptuous and inviting that it's easy to lose Thaemlitz's socio-political motives: a Trojan horse whose trap-door gets stuck. <i>Midtown 120 Blues</i> is being reissued, in deluxe packaging but with no additional or altered music, after just five years, though the record's scarcity and limited reach justify that decision.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Thaemlitz is best known as an experimental, electro-acoustic composer, and she has released difficult, conceptual works for labels like Mille Plateaux since the mid-90s. (With 2012's <i>Soulnessless</i>, she claimed to have released the longest-ever album, anchored by a 29-hour piano meditation.) In the early '90s, before she was releasing experimental works, <a href=""http://www.comatonse.com/releases/c006.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thaemlitz worked as a DJ</a> in the type of midtown clubs that defined Times Square before it was corporatized later in the decade. These formative spaces gave a home to the different strains of house music emanating from New Jersey and New York, a sound more contemplative than that which was coming out of Chicago: slower, jazzier, more reflective. It was music made and then defined by disadvantaged communities: by latinos and blacks and the LGBT community.</p>
<p>Thaemlitz has produced house music under a number of different aliases, but the deconstructivist instincts that dominate her experimental works aren't as dominant here. <i>Midtown 120 Blues</i> travels familiar territory, working through lived-in hi-hat patterns and familiar, calming electric piano chords. It helps the medicine go down easier, sure, but there's not that much medicine. You get the sense that this style is so dear to Thaemlitz that she's less willing to fuck with it, at least on a sonic level. <i>Midtown 120 Blues</i>, at nearly 80 minutes, is almost womb-like in its immersion, though Thaemlitz rejects the idea of the club as a healing, safe space. You don't ""lose yourself"" in <i>Midtown 120 Blues</i>; it's a reflection on feeling lost.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Thaemlitz began documenting this scene in 1998, shortly after those clubs were elbowed out of downtown, with the <i>Sloppy 42nds</i> 12"", her first work under the DJ Sprinkles alias. <i>Midtown 120 Blues</i> again took this baton a decade later, chronicling the turbulence and violation that existed in Thaemlitz's communities; it's an album that seethes, however prettily, as Thaemlitz laces her patient, supple grooves with short speeches.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">One poignant segment of ""Ball'r (Madonna-Free Zone)"" finds her railing against Madonna, whose ""decontextualized, reified, corporatized, liberalized, neutralized, asexualized, re-genderized pop reflection"" of the vogue scene not only misrepresented the scene's origins but left the queen ""who actually taught [Madonna] how to vogue"" broke. Thaemlitz is a compelling speaker, and the hurt and anger in her voice is obvious; she's also deft enough to let the preachers, whom she often samples, do the preaching. <i>Midtown 120 Blues</i> feels far more personal than political.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Midtown 120 Blues</i> is a remembrance, but it's also a travelogue, loosely documenting Thaemlitz's move from her childhood home in Missouri and her immersion in midtown's scene. ""Grand Central, Pt. II (72 hrs. by Rail from Missouri)"" functions largely like the KLF's <i>Chill Out</i>, organizing samples into an ambient collage that holds your attention even as it drifts for eight minutes. Moments like these feel like a salve for Jesse Jackson, who burns through his (sampled) vocal chords on ""Sisters, I Don't Know What This World is Coming To"" and the nervous, pendulous piano of ""House Music Is Controllable Desire You Can Own"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like punk music, house music was an underground phenomenon that offered an outlet to people who really needed an outlet. And like punk music, its history is romanticized to the point that the ills and misdeeds that still permeated the community are largely ignored. In the mid-'90s Thaemlitz was fired from a prominent DJ gig because she refused to play Gloria Estefan, a frequent request from the johns who would frequent the club; the johns, after all, kept the club open.</p>
<p>Thaemlitz quit, exhibiting the kind of principled stubbornness that has guided her career. This persists: <i>Midtown 120 Blues</i> will not be issued on vinyl, a medium unable to provide an accurate stereo bass response. Still, there's a fondness to <i>Midtown 120 Blues</i>, not least in its closing shuffle, ""The Occaional Feel-Good"". There is love here, however guarded. At its best, <i>Midtown 120 Blues</i> simultaneously acts as a corrective to house's ahistorical narrative and reminds us just how potent and beautiful New York deep house can be.<span id=""docs-internal-guid-7da2606a-40ec-86d2-c1d6-d25a3ae0258a""><br/></span></p></div>"|19402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19402-dj-sprinkles-midtown-120-blues/|8.5|Andrew Gaerig

In an age where a cloak of mystery seems more rule than exception, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30373-dean-blunt-inga-copeland/"">Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland</a>'s (presumably) fake names and slippery interview tactics always felt like an altogether different beast. They somehow managed to combine total transparency with a shroud of secrecy; with all those obfuscations flying around, you could never be too sure where anything stood with them, even when they seemed to be giving it to you straight-up. Their music similarly existed in the cracks between genres: too out-there for post-dubstep, too amorphous for IDM. With no neatly packaged narrative to bounce off of, listeners had to seek answers in the music itself: no mean feat, when—much like its makers—that music never quite seemed to stay in one place long enough to wrap your head around it.</p>
<p>Copeland and Blunt parted ways in 2013, after the release of <i>Black is Beautiful</i>, a record that stripped away some—but certainly not all—of the willful obtusity of their previous shapeshifting. As Blunt offered up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17956-dean-blunt-the-redeemer""><i>the Redeemer</i></a>—a presumptive breakup record that sported some of the most straightforward, soul-baring music of his career—Inga Copeland issued the brief, bracing <i>Don't Look Back, That's Not Where You're Going</i> EP, an occasionally puzzling, frequently beguiling array of corroded electronics and clamorous calls-to-action. Now, Copeland's returned with her debut full-length, <i>Because I'm Worth It</i>, another strange, singular record that offers as many questions as it does answers. It's not an easy listen, but Copeland wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<p>Opener ""Faith OG X"" begins with a discomfiting crackle of static. It's soon overtaken by a queasy, lurching synth, and then, two minutes in, a thought-swallowing, concentration-decimating beep. The effect of this incessant ping proves wildly disorienting; after a few spins, you'll learn to anticipate it, but you'll never quite get used to it. That's true for much of <i>Because I'm Worth It</i>, a nebulous, deviously off-kilter listen, impossible and intriguing in roughly equal measure, constantly rearranging itself for maximum discombobulation.</p>
<p>Over the whinny-and-pop of a door on a hinge, ""Advice to Young Girls""—produced in conjunction with her fellow UK beatmangler <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"">Actress</a>—finds Copeland in direct-address mode. ""Sneak out the window and meet your friends on the corner,"" she urges. ""Together, you're strong. You walk the streets: face the city, face the night. The city is yours."" ""Advice"" is <i>Worth It</i>'s finest hour, a near-perfect meeting of music and message; between Copeland's uncompromising aesthetic and her appeals to self-expression and sisterhood, ""Advice"" feels bold, urgent, necessary.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""Advice to Young Girls"" is one of few vocal-centric tracks on <i>Worth It</i>; most of the rest is given over to Copeland's clattering, claustrophobic production. At barely half an hour,<i> Because I'm Worth It</i> is a dank, foreboding listen, a difficult space to accustom oneself to, at once enervating and intoxicating. The murky, pitched-down voice buried near the back of ""Insult 2 Injury"" is largely obscured by its sputtering rhythms and frosty synths, while the dank, zero-gravity dancehall of ""Inga"" finds her voice slathered in effects, rendering them half-incomprehensible. This is slippery, expectation-upending stuff; even after umpteen listens, you'll never quite feel as though you've acclimated yourself to the darkness.</p>
<p class=""p2""> There are moments—the morse code tappings of ""Serious"", the jolting beat and transmogrifying synths of closer ""L'oreal""—that seem just little too hermetic, too impenetrable, lost down the hall of mirrors Copeland's built around them. And while the briefer pieces—""Serious,"" again, and the strange, sinewy ""DILIGENCE""—help tie everything together, neither holds a candle to the denser, more enveloping darkness that surround them. Taken together, though, all these abstractions and interjections forge a dingy, disquieting dreamscape that seems to operate by its own laws of physics. The oft-bewildering <i>Worth It</i> is, like every record Copeland's put her name to, a deeply challenging, deliberately unorthodox listen. But you're not likely to hear another record quite like it anytime soon, and the impression it leaves isn't an easy one to shake.</p></div>"|19392.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19392-copeland-because-im-worth-it/|7.1|Paul Thompson

The Australia-born, Iceland-based composer has written scores for dance companies, soundtracked films, and collaborated with visual artists and poets. He cast himself as a kind of endurance artist on the cover of his 2007 album <i>Theory of Machines</i> and, in 2013, directed his own theatrical adaption of Iain Banks’ novel <a href=""http://www.iain-banks.net/uk/the-wasp-factory/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Wasp Factory</i></a>. Frost also co-produced experimental saxophonist Colin Stetson’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17950-colin-stetson-new-history-warfare-vol-3/""><i>New History Warfare, Volume 3</i></a> in 2013, played “fire” on Swans’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/""><i>The Seer</i></a> a year earlier, and is an important collaborator for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a>. Outside the studio, he’s articulate when discussing what he’s doing, loading comments about his work with heavy concepts and meaning: his interviews fold in references to biology, astronomy, literature, nature, art, professional basketball. For all this, his music is equally fascinating when you strip away the context and simply let the sounds he’s making overtake you.</p>
<p>Frost’s latest album, <i>A U R O R A</i>, offers his best example yet of this sort of aural suffocation. The uptick could partly be due to a new approach: Unlike his past work, there are no guitars, piano, or stringed instruments; instead, the 41-minute collection focuses on synthesizers and the heavy percussion of ex-Liturgy drummer and current Guardian Alien leader Greg Fox, Swans’ Thorr Harris, and multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily. <i>A U R O R A</i> is, in a sense, the proper companion to 2009’s excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13809-by-the-throat/""><i>By the Throat</i></a>, but it’s shaggier and more intense. Still, Frost is able to maintain a sense of spaciousness amid the feedback.</p>
<p>That feeling of distance coincides with the facts of <i>A U R O R A</i>’s creation: Frost wrote most of the collection on a laptop while working with photographer/filmmaker Richard Mosse in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. (Mosse and cinematographer Trevor Tweeten, in turn, made a series of grainy films—explosions, volcanoes, bullets through bodies—as a rollout to <i>A U R O R A</i>, as well as the album’s cover art). He also recorded in Empac, New York, and Reykjavik—where he mixed the record with Valgeir Sigurdsson—and somewhere along the way, Tim Hecker provided sound design and post-production work.</p>
<p>Despite its scattered creation, I tend to listen to <i>A U R O R A</i> as one long piece, letting the different modes congeal into a whole. You hear minimalism buried in the fuzz, and it’s also easy to tell that Frost is fond of industrial, punk, and metal. Instead of the noisy, meditative openers of past outings,  <i>A U R O R A</i>'s first track, “Flex”, sounds like an airplane taking off; the steady, escalating synthesizer gives way to frantic jazz drumming partially consumed the crackling, loose wires around it. This bleeds into “Nolan”, a track that would fit easily on Tim Hecker’s <i>Harmony in Ultraviolet, </i>featuring a percussive thump—sticks rattling, synthesizers lapping. Like much of <i>A U R O R A</i>, it feels like a battle between the human and the digital, Frost’s cold synthesizers and laptops vs. his collaborators’ sweaty percussion. </p>
<p>But the album is not all violent stoicism; there’s dark humor here as well. “Diphenyl Oxalate”, a track named for the chemical used in glowsticks, hits like a black metal rave, and it’s one of a few places where Frost seems to be creating dance music, or at least music that makes your innards move. In this mode, he fits in line with producers like Container, Sandwell District, Demdike Stare, and Vatican Shadow, but he never stays in one place, and the album is filled with variety and a great sense of dynamics. The previously mentioned “Nolan” takes an Eastern turn, and mixes in wind chimes beneath a gale force surge. “No Sorrowing” is a hazy, restful drift. The warping “Sola Fide” sounds like loose wires and firecrackers, but maintains a melodic side. (In the liner notes, Eddi the Bomb is credited with “explosives.”)</p>
<p>If the album has a center, it’s “Venter”, which has a little of everything Frost does well. It opens with a blend of clean and distorted hand drums, which are joined by a distant, crystalline synthesizer that grows stronger over the first two minutes before practically being buried by the sound of bells and chimes. For the remaining four and a half minutes, these strands fluctuate, growing more intense, but also more refined. Then, at the four-minute mark, almost like offering some kind of introverted, experimental take on an EDM drop, the track gains a new kind of force and momentum on the back of whiplashing electronics. It’s an epic track, the kind of song that fills up a room.</p>
<p>Frost named ""Venter"" after biologist Craig Venter, the first person to create a cell containing a synthetic genome.

It could be a reminder that skate kids and <i>Thrasher</i> subscribers have always dug the more aggressive side of rap. Or it might just be the band and Alchemist share a similar interest in shoving your face into concrete. </p>
<p>At any rate, it's over before it's begun, and Trash Talk plunge directly into ""Jigsaw"", the sort of formally immaculate purist hardcore they've been making since their inception. There is another minute-long Alchemist contribution near the album's end, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29959-king-krule/"">King Krule</a> also shows up on the bonus track ""Stacking Skins""; he sounds spectacular, inviting the imagination-firing notion of a Krule-fronted hardcore band. But otherwise<i>, No Peace</i> sounds, as Tom Breihan said in his review of 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14102-eyes-nines/"">Eyes &amp; Nines</a></i>, like it could have come out ""any point in at least the last 15 years."" In that context, the two Alc snippets and King Krule bonus track feel like a tiny sprig of microgreen placed delicately atop a massive Sloppy Joe.</p>
<p>But Trash Talk don't need to move beyond hardcore's lockstep for new ground; they are finding plenty of room within it. <i>No Peace</i> runs to sixteen tracks and half an hour—several lifetimes' worth of music in the suicide-sprinter's world of hardcore, and even longer than their last one, 2012's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17135-119"">119</a>.</i> They've perfected the balance they set out for on 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15911-awake/""><i>Awake</i></a> EP and experimented with further on <i>119</i>, adding microhooks, catchier riffs, and song structures to the lean skeletons of their songs to see what they can manage without adding wind resistance. <i>No Peace </i>is their most sustained effort in this regard, and ranges a little further across classic hardcore territory: ""Just a Taste"" is the most they've ever sounded like Suicidal Tendencies, and the hook on ""Cloudkicker"" might be their biggest melodic chorus yet.</p>
<p>Frontman Lee Spielman's lyrics, meanwhile, have grown increasingly tortured and introspective. ""I've made mistakes/ I did my time,"" he screams on ""Jigsaw"", a song about sorting through your life. The screamed, pit-rallying chorus of the song is ""Think it through"", and Spielman is letting us hear him think more intensely in his songs with each release. He's not giving us dissertations—this is still hardcore, where your point needs to be screamed in sharp syllables. But the slogans on <i>No Peace</i> point emphatically inward: ""All these songs about sleep/And I can't catch a wink,"" he says on ""Locked In Skin"", a vulnerable admission that hits with surprising force.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>No Peace </i>feel like character sketches as often as personal narratives--dispatches, possibly, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8900-trash-talk/"">the ravaged neighborhood in Los Angeles</a> where they now live and record. On ""The Hole"", Spielman declares, ""I won't look the other way for anyone but me/ And that's the way it's always gonna be."" On ""Body Stuffer"", he sings about ""Dogs barking/ But only for a second or two"" before he's ""onto the next one."" The bleakness feels more panoramic than before, and when it zooms inward, it tap into reservoirs of power that Trash Talk are only beginning to explore. </p></div>"|19398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19398-trash-talk-no-peace/|7.7|Jayson Greene

But its mission has remained consistent throughout: to breathe new life into the sounds and structures of early dance music, particularly the interplay between producer and vocalist that underpinned the genre’s formative years. On the group’s first two records, 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11269-hercules-and-love-affair/"">self-titled debut</a> and 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15050-blue-songs/""><i>Blue Songs</i></a>, they accomplished that goal by exploding the tropes of early house music while simultaneously paying fealty to them, resulting in tracks like the quasi-operatic, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11745-antony-hegarty/"">Antony</a>-led “Blind” that reincarnated the style into ambitiously strange shapes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For <i>The Feast of the Broken Heart</i>, Butler and his team (which this time around includes Viennese house-and-techno revivalists Haze Factory and industrial music stalwart Mark Pistel) color inside the lines a little more than before. If the first two Hercules records were tributes to the dawning era of dance music thirty or so years ago, <i>Feast</i> is more of a flat-out homage. The sounds, the structures, and the entire approach more closely resembles the source material—the propulsive, hard-edged descendant of disco that pioneers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2465-larry-levan/"">Larry Levan</a> were spinning in the '70s and '80s. Having spent years deconstructing old house music, Butler's now become a considerably more faithful and accurate emulator.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are drawbacks to any artistic undertaking with an explicit retro-revivalist agenda, and <i>Feast</i> suffers accordingly—in particular, there's the subtle but ever-present sensation that, for all the excitement that the music generates, it’s still an echo of someone else’s good time that happened decades ago. Butler and company mitigate much of that feeling by giving their influences a sonic touch-up, dirtying and tweaking out the vintage drum machine and synthesizer sounds they’re working with (check the noisy synth that puts an intriguing wrinkle into the smooth lines of “My Offence”), in the process infusing them with a wily energy that more fastidious retro reproductions can’t manage. Hercules and Love Affair give these tracks more room to breathe than the sometimes claustrophobically compact arrangements on older house records.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>To some extent, <i>The Feast of the Broken Heart</i> bounces back against those drawbacks because of the nature of the style Hercules and Love Affair working in. Compared to the other major pop genres, dance music has historically been immune to the effects of nostalgia because it’s spent so much of its existence, at least in America, as a subcultural style with an audience that’s been removed from the mainstream (partly because it’s been so relentlessly forward-looking from the genre's beginnings). The recent arrival of younger rave revivalists and old-school house fanatics, however, has caused the genre as a whole to take a good look at its past and try, in earnest, to replicate it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like Hercules’s first two records, <i>Feast</i> transcends mere homage not only through sonic innovations but by the quality of the emotional connection it makes with its audience. Butler is both a gifted producer and a crafty A&amp;R, and throughout the album he fits an unexpected cast of singers to songs based on criteria much more subtle and significant than their vocal range. The stage performer Rouge Mary imparts disco-diva uplift to the self-realization anthem “5:43 to Freedom”, elevating a hokey line like “Be yourself/ Like there ain’t nobody” into something that could genuinely inspire a dancefloor epiphany. On “My Offence”, singer-songwriter Krystle Warren, whose own work normally leans towards rootsy chamber pop, brings a raspy low range and gleaming high range with the same kind of casual fuck-you attitude that's similarly animated other statement-of-identity house tracks offering spiritual solace to several generations of club-going social misfits.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The album’s emotional and musical peak comes with “I Try to Talk to You”, featuring alt-folk singer and former Czars front man John Grant. It’s about Grant’s experience finding out he’s H.I.V. positive, and knowing that about the song can make it a gutting listen, especially on the choruses where he crooningly pleads, “I don’t understand, help me please.” But instead of backing him up with a dirge, Butler and his crew give him a raucous, thumping floor-filler. To some, combining lyrics about a potentially life-threatening illness with the gaudy synthesized orchestral stabs the track’s festooned with might seem crass, <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">but it’s exactly this refusal to bow to tragedy that kept the original house music scene alive through the ravages of the AIDS crisis.</span> With it, Hercules &amp; Love Affair tap into an essential part of house music’s history that’s far more profound than just the music.</span></p></div>"|19396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19396-hercules-and-love-affair-the-feast-of-the-broken-heart/|7.6|Miles Raymer

Marc Bowles, b/k/a Mr. Thing of the UK turntablist collective Scratch Perverts, is ridiculously dedicated to the art of unearthing what-on-Earth 45s and stringing them together with little regard for genre, national origin, or much of anything else besides a certain feel of knuckleball unpredictability. In 2008 and 2009, the first two volumes of his BBE </span><span>series <i>Strange Breaks &amp; Mr. Thing </i></span><span>pulled double-duty as the type of curation efforts that are obscurity-hunters' dreams, as well as mixes that personify the philosophy of vinyl-slingers from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28105-the-gaslamp-killer/"">the Gaslamp Killer</a> all the way back to David Mancuso. Once the momentum's established, you might as well leave the ""genre"" descriptor blank and just zone out.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The series' third volume is as characteristically preposterous as the previous two, crammed with what the sleeve dubs ""Rock, Funk, Soul, Jazz &amp; Soundtrack Breaks for Modern Living"" and threading them into a free-for-all that scans as hip-hop, even when the material feels more ""strange"" than ""breaks"". Naturally, there are some gutbucket funk sides, a few of which—the Internationals' piano-pounding motivational boot to the butt ""Give a Damn"", the midtempo horn-and-organ wild-out of Nu Sound Express Ltd.'s ""One More Time, You All"", the gently concussive blend of featherweight falsetto lover-man vocals and speedbag-workout drums of the Capprells' ""Close Your Eyes""—still manage to surprise even after a couple decades' worth of compilers' local-label R&amp;B mining.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But it's the more peripherally funk curios that give the collection its real personality. The DJ's secret weapon of left-field library-music cuts gets some time in the repertoire, via James Asher's regrettably exoticized-yet-effectively slinky ""Oriental Workload""—and even that cut comes across as relatively basic compared to a cover of the theme to UK cop-show ""The Sweeney"", courtesy of the Woolwich Polytechnic School Concert Band. Weaving in a few other nods towards international flavor—a re-edit of music from a belly-dancer instructional record, a steel-drum cover of Ripple's ""I Don't Know What It Is, but It Sure Is Funky""—bypasses the audio-tourist kitsch potential for the kick-snare whomp that lies beneath. Sometimes, the draw of Bowles' selections are almost purely atmospheric; Sharon Cash's version of the old standard ""Nature Boy"" eventually crescendos into pin-you-down orchestral funk bombast, but her euphorically dazed-sounding voice, as well as the serpentine strings and chimes that rustle underneath it, grab your collar far before that happens.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The unmixed compilation itself is fine enough, if a bit prone to the filler that can sometimes crop up when ""rare"" supercedes ""revelatory"". So</span><span> it's a good thing that Bowles actually includes a continuous scratched mix as part of the package, as it shows what good it does you to have crates like the ones that he possesses. He beatmatches smoothly when the BPMs line up, throws in nimble scratches or goofy snippets of diabolical laughter when they don't, and maintains a feeling somewhere between winking levity and appreciative eclecticism the whole way through. By the halfway mark, it's almost easy to forget that this stuff's supposed to be weird, but the backbone of the beat is a bit harder to lose track of.</span></p></div>"|19310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19310-strange-breaks-mr-thing-iii/|7.8|Nate Patrin

Rather, it's an album recorded in 1995 that just never got released. How it ended up that way—well, nobody really remembers. (How's that for self-mythologizing?) But let's back up a bit: what the hell is Officer!, you ask? It was the baby of Londoner Mick Hobbs, a quirky rocker who had his start in the RIO scene—that's Rock in Opposition, a UK movement started in the late '70s to promote ""progressive"" and non-commercial bands in the wake of both punk and corporate rock—with stints in groups like the Work and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1874-half-japanese/"">Half Japanese</a>, among others. By no means a solo project, Officer! was a revolving-door band that centered around Hobbs' uniquely zany persona, a little bit psychedelic and very English. They released a few cassettes (one of which, 1984's <i>Ossification</i>, just got its own reissue), but <i>Dead Unique</i>, the project's most recent work, might just be its most fully realized, as well as its most unhinged.</span></p>
<p><span>Officer! sound like the madcap psychedelia of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/298-syd-barrett/"">Syd Barrett</a> bred with the whimsy of Canterbury psychedelic bands, executed with the frayed mental state of post-punk. Sometimes, they barely sound like a functioning band on <i>Dead Unique</i>, but other moments showcase a tight ensemble tying in blues and progressive rock into their patchwork weave. If that all sounds a little out of place on a label like Blackest Ever Black—usually home to dark electronics from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30862-raime/"">Raime</a> and Tropic of Cancer—that's because it is, but nonetheless there's a menacing undertone to Officer!'s strange nursery rhymes. Paranoia surfaces in tracks like ""Go Back"", where Hobbs sings ""People of the world/ Lie to us/ Like you lie to me,"" a choked phrase that you imagine coming out from a crooked smile with rotten and missing teeth. It's the kind of crackpot worldview you get from someone who's taken a little too much acid in their lifetime, but coming from Hobbs it feels tongue-in-cheek, delivered with a nod and a wink.</span><br/> <br/> <span>This off-kilter sensibility also lends some of the songwriting a manic quality. ""Go Back"" somehow resolves into a motivational climax, with Hobbs impelling repeatedly, ""You lose, you learn/ You advance/ But you always go back."" ""It Goes Up"" is bustling, haplessly layered with shrill sax and chaotic chatter, while ""Shrug/Good"" finds itself in a vaudeville costume after starting out like a power-pop jam. Meanwhile, the chunky ""Nardis"" has the dextrous feel of a crack bar band, navigating guitar lyrics and syncopated rhythms with dazzling ease, but the vocals are bleated out through a wall of filters. Nothing's ever quite as it seems on <i>Dead Unique.</i></span><br/> <br/> <span>What's most striking about <i>Dead Unique</i> is how much it sounds like <i>Ossification. </i>Aside from a slight improvement in sound quality and some studio embellishments, <i>Dead Unique</i> sounds like an even weirder version of the album that came eleven years previous, which is good news for existing fans of Hobbs. His muse is so frantically diverse that the album's eighteen tracks can sound overwhelming, but its sprawl is all contained in the same world. Listening to <i>Dead Unique</i> is like walking through the different sets of some imaginary fantasy series—there are monsters here, strange animals there, a wide array of dazzling trinkets and colours, and it's all distinctly artificial. The considerable list of personnel adds to that fact too, with artists like Patrick Q (the Legendary Pink Dots), Fred Collins (Pleasant Livers), and John Dierker adding their own vocals, violin and even clarinet to the LP's endlessly expressive sound palette.</span><br/> <br/> <span><i>Dead Unique</i>'s centrepiece is buried towards the end: the five-minute spoken-word screed ""The Pony Was Contented"" stalks and spurts forward like a cartoon character trying to sneak up on someone, all while telling a stream-of-consciousness story with a whole lot of subject confusion about the pony for good measure. The way Hobbs holds the words ""my little pony"" in his mouth becomes unsettling after a while, but even when you can't figure out what the hell is going on, he and his band are as captivating as they are confounding. The tune represents one of many peeks into Officer!'s strange little environment on <i>Dead Unique</i>, a world as vibrant as a children's storybook but written with the acerbic wit of an eccentric Englishman.</span></p></div>"|19372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19372-officer-dead-unique/|8.0|Andrew Ryce

If 2012’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16415-hundred-waters/""><i> </i>self-titled effort</a> saw the band sketching out the borders of their sound, <i>The Moon Rang Like a Bell</i> finds them zeroing in on what they do best and going deeper. The production is improved in every way, but given how hushed and quiet they can be, the effect is still pretty subtle. Acoustic instruments have been jettisoned; the pillowy synths and layered vocals of singer Nicole Miglis nestle easily in the mix, sometimes leaving questions as to when one end and another begins. Indeed, the key to Hundred Waters’ rich and tactile atmosphere is that their machines never sound quite like machines, but everything sounds close; on “Murmurs”, distant piano is buried under reverb and digital crackle, sketching out chords with a vaguely gospel feel, as a strange voice sings a tune while so near to the microphone you can hear a tongue clicking against teeth. It’s an album that always feels like it’s whispering in your ear.</p>
<p>The band’s approach is difficult to place in a specific time. That’s not because their aesthetic is especially innovative or new, or because it seems like it’s from the future; rather, they bring to mind a moment when updating dusty old song structures with the tools of the present seemed like the next logical step in music. “Digital folk” was the term used in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16415-hundred-waters/"">a review of their self-titled debut</a>, and that captures it as well as anything: music that is both earthy and disembodied, with humans and electronics joining at some blissful halfway point. Hundred Waters thrive in the place where post-rock meets freak folk, and sing-song melodies are twisted into strange shapes by circuitry.</p>
<p>The connection to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a> is hard to overstate. Part of <i>The Moon</i>’s appeal is that it hearkens back to the style of <i>Vespertine</i>, the last album when Björk’s restlessly experimental music still had a foot in accessibility, before she took such a conceptual turn. There’s a similar sense of music-as-place here, and a desire to fuse ancient and modern in search of a new mode of expression. And in that respect, oddly enough, Hundred Waters remind me of another group from Iceland—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2865-mum"">Múm</a>, in particular their 2000 album <i>Yesterday Was Dramatic—Today is OK</i>, an album sometimes described at the time as “folktronica.” These aren’t <i>influences</i> I’m talking about, necessarily, but ways of hearing what Hundred Waters are doing. It’s not a coincidence that these signposts are from music made around the turn of the millennium, when rapidly changing technology meant the future sound of pop was up in the air.</p>
<p>But if much of Björk’s power comes from her unpredictability, the feeling that a breathy sight could turn into a scream and a song might explode, Hundred Waters are always set to simmer. That mostly works in their favor on <i>The Moon Rang Like a Bell</i>, as the album’s strength comes from its gradually accruing moments. So the spell of the minute-long a cappella opener “Show Me Love” is broken by clear piano chords and miniature percussive explosions on “Murmurs” and then the following “Cavity” raises the intensity before the bright and twinkly “Out Alee” brings it back to earth. Sequenced beautifully, the record is full of these gentle arcs, and the sound is so consistent it can feel like a 49-minute piece broken into 12 movements. The impact of any one song is heightened by its proximity to what came before and what follows.</p>
<p>In an interview, Miglis highlighted the importance of her lyrics to <i>The Moon Rang Like a Bell</i>, but for me the album functions more like an instrumental album, where meaning comes from the sonics. On the page, her words are allusive and fragmented, hinting at moments of doubt and turmoil, but on record, the words come over as pure sound. There’s a moment about halfway through “Innocent” where Miglis breaks away from language and sings a “dah-dah-dah-do-dum” phrase, but with her voice coated in processed fuzz, she sounds like an amphibious creature prone to reverie. This line communicates as well as any phrase on the album. “Is it only in my head?”, she asks a moment later, and it wouldn’t be a bad subtitle for an album so steeped in imagination.</p></div>"|19311.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19311-hundred-waters-the-moon-rang-like-a-bell/|8.3|Mark Richardson

There was a real sense that Lott thought this proverbial Shangri-La was impossible to actually reach, but amidst the album's density there was also a deep-rooted optimism that suggested that utopia could still be found on the rock we're currently floating through space on. On his new EP, <i>Alternate Worlds</i>, which reconfigures songs from <i>Lanterns</i>, that sanguine outlook has been all but scrubbed away, and what's left is darkened and clouded over until it resembles something closer to weary skepticism, if not outright cynicism.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this philosophical recalibration more apparent than on ""Easy (Switch Screens)"". Of the four tracks Lott reimagines on <i>Alternate Worlds</i>, ""Easy"" is the most dramatically reworked, and its revised form leaves the greatest impression thanks to the presence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"">Lorde</a>, who adds a sense of menace that Lott previously hasn't elicited on his own. It's an inspired bit of recasting, the creeping tentacles of Lorde's voice tightening around the track as Lott hollows it out even further, leaving an irradiated husk for Lorde to slither in and out of with her vocals. Any sunlight present on the original has been blotted out completely, and the result is a chillier and more seductive take on what was, in its previous form, one of the highlights on <i>Lanterns</i>.</p>
<p>Lott takes a similar approach with the other three tracks here, stripping them back in hopes of finding something more elemental, but this approach proves hit-or-miss. In Lott's world, more is more, a songwriting mindset that hasn't always produced optimal results, so <i>Alternate Worlds</i> represents an effort to give his work more room to stretch out and breathe. But the decluttering also exposes weak points, and when there's less sonically to share the spotlight with his vocals and songwriting, it's harder to ignore the inherent flaws in Lott's anonymous vocals and reliance on lyrical platitudes.</p>
<p>That said, the reconfigurations featured on <i>Alternate Worlds</i> are largely improvements on the songs they draw from; ""Alternate World (Alternate Age)"" slathers Lott's vocals in a number of effects (almost a winking admission that his vocals have never been a main draw), and ""Build a Pyre (Begin Again)"" is even itchier than the original ""Pyre"", sounding like thousands of ants crawling underneath the listener's skin. But with the exception of ""Easy (Switch Screens)"", these tracks remain on the inessential end of the spectrum. These darker-if-not-darkest-timeline versions possess fewer dimensions than their original incarnations did, even if they pack more of a punch, and that's the paradox that surrounds these <i>Alternate Worlds</i>.</p></div>"|19377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19377-son-lux-alternate-worlds-ep/|6.5|Renato Pagnani

<p>Evans has been on the scene for a couple of years now; his 2012 EP, <i>Rejoice, </i>showcased a different sound, one that resembled the webby, woozed-out R&amp;B of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28501-shlohmo/"">Shlohmo</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a>. Since then, he's made beats for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30648-aap-ferg"">A$AP Ferg</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/"">Kelela</a>, developing a more focused sound along the way. What hasn't changed, though, is Evans' penchant for stuffing his music full of ideas, resulting in tracks that are deceptively complicated even at their most digestible.</p>
<p><i>Incursio </i>translates to ""attack"" in Latin, and some of the album's standout tracks come across as aural assaults. The title of “DARPA” is a reference to an agency in the U.S. Department of Defense, and suitably, it's one of the most aggressive tracks on <i>Incursio</i>, a paranoid, drill-influenced screecher. Similarly aggressive tracks like “Principalities” and the bonus cut “Seal VI” bring to mind Kode9’s ideas about <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Sonic-Warfare-Ecology-Technologies-Abstraction/dp/0262517957"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sonic warfare</a>—these tracks are cutting and urgent, adrenaline-raising affairs. Evans remains a subtle beat-maker, though, even when he’s making the hair on your neck stand up, so focusing on his sonic layering proves most fascinating. He throws out new ideas at a speedy pace; on “W (Dub)”, a harmless, dubby loop is both bolstered and complicated by shifting xylophone melodies and a winding crank below the surface.</p>
<p><i>Incursio</i>’s title and album art may give the impression that Evans has created a politicized beat-oriented record, but there are plenty of friendly sounds on the album that take aim at broader themes, including romance. The best of the love-focused songs is “Is It Love?”, a floating, synth-driven, electro track which brings to mind recent offerings from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19216-lockah-yahoo-or-the-highway/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Lockah</a>, or a chilled out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"">Hudson Mohawke</a>.</p>
<p>The most surprising moments on <i>Incursio</i>, however, are the tracks that deal explicitly with Christian faith. “1 Peter 1:3-4”, which refers to a bible verse in which the glory of Christ is praised, is a burbling electronic ode  that sounds as if it’s drunk on itself. The title of “Ἰησοῦς” is a Greek rendering of Jesus’ name, and “Peace &amp; Safety / Αἰφνίδιος Ολεθρος” refers to a verse in Thessalonians—but these light, synthy tunes aren't attempting to proselytize. Instead, they're intimate, pretty, and bubbly, recasting the notion of religion as personal and uplifting.</p>
<p><i>Incursio</i> suggests an enormous amount of potential, but Evans still has a bit of work to do before he's able to project the dynamism of a more confident artist; there's practically two albums' worth of ideas here, but even as individual tracks are sharpened to a point, the dizzying array of concepts and modes feel overbearing and unfocused. Still, <i>Incursio</i> is a frequently exciting record, full of instrumental artillery that makes plenty of noise, even when it’s slightly off-target.</p></div>"|19367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19367-napolian-incursio/|7.3|Jonah Bromwich

The separation involved no Twitter beefs or scandalous dramatics, though; rather, ST 2 Lettaz and Clova claimed that the breakup was mutual, and the amicable musical divorce comes to a close with their return, marked by the new full-length <i>Gz II Godz</i>. The duo pick up where they left off with their humble-focused style, suggesting that, despite the time away, they haven't changed much.</p>
<p>In the years marked by the duo's absence, rap has undergone quite a few sonic changes; most notably, Lex Luger's booming maximalism that kicked open the decade has been replaced with the west coast minimalism of DJ Mustard. <i>Gz II Godz</i> sounds largely indifferent to that shift, with a majority of the album production handled by their frequent collaborators Block Beattaz. From the weightless “2004” to the sleepy bass buzz of “Bassheadz”, the album sticks closer to the trance-y, dreamy sound that the duo's gained notice for; indeed, Block Beataz’s ephemeral synths and light trunk-rattling thump make for staring into stars on a late-night drive.</p>
<p>G-Side’s primary lyrical concern is focused, again, on achieving financial success without resorting to illicit means. ST 2 Lettaz and Clova rap about international flights, smoking weed, and fashion trends, but their moments of braggadocio are grounded in G-Side's day-to-day musical grind. On “Statue”, they rap, “Tell them build a statue/ Build a statue of a real nigga/ In the middle of the city,” which reveals them buying into their own established legacy. But <i>Gz II Godz</i> also finds G-Side zeroing in on preserving their name, which, for them, means striking a balance between figuring out how to pay rent and continuing to expand their fanbase.</p>
<p>In an interview with SPIN that announced the duo separation, ST 2 Lettaz admitted, “We needed a fresh start or a fresh look—it had gotten stale,” which was perhaps a realistic view of the group's future. Honesty has always been located at the core of G-Side’s music, but they remain striving nonetheless, and <i>Gz II Godz</i> is the work of a duo that have only gotten wiser since they last rhymed together.</p></div>"|19413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19413-g-side-gz-ii-godz/|7.2|David Turner

It wouldn’t be a surprise to find this, her debut album, tucked away in a 99 cent rack in a record store, and then later discover it going for $40 or more elsewhere. Even its birth was difficult, with a white label of the album allegedly passed around for many years before its official 1993 release on Mute/Rhythm Kind subsidiary Transglobal. But <i>Witch</i> clearly got into the right hands at some point during its early phase; it’s widely assumed to have been heard by a number of trip-hop figureheads, who looped a similar thread through soul, hip-hop, dub, and punk, linking it to the despair of a country battered by over a decade of right-wing rule.</p>
<p>Winer lived in England at the time of <i>Witch </i>but her backstory takes her all over. Originally from Western Massachusetts, she attended art school in New York, befriended beats <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5866-william-s-burroughs/"">William S. Burroughs</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Huncke"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Herbert Huncke</a>, travelled the world as a fashion model, and wound up in London in the mid 1980s. Her life took further complicated and often incredible turns, as told by <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/10505-leslie-winer-witch-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">these</a> <a href=""http://crfashionbook.com/post/33407973600/leslie-winer-the-radical-life-of-an-enduring"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two</a> features on her, but a key detail as far as <i>Witch</i> is concerned was her meeting with Karl Bonnie from dubbed-out experimental dance act <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renegade_Soundwave"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Renegade Soundwave</a>. The pair, along with accomplice John Keogh and engineer Matthew Faddy, pieced together this album, releasing it under the name © in its initial form. Strangely, the tortuous gestation period puts it in the odd position of being both ahead of its time (during its long pre-release circulation) and behind it (on its release in a country about to be awash in trip-hop in 1993).</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a> were already active by the time <i>Witch</i> was completed, so its influence shouldn’t be overstated. Either way, Winer claims not to have heard them until after its completion, adding to the feeling of there being something in the air in England around the time all these ideas were coalescing. It’s mostly in the music that ties are made—thick, dubby bass underpins almost everything, sometimes becoming the entire sound, at other times providing a backdrop to the kind of spaced-out beats every musician in Bristol seemed to be binging on at the time. <i>Witch</i> picks up its own energy from Winer’s lyrics and delivery, many of which are far more political in outlook than her peers in this sound. On the outstanding “N1ear”, she delivers spoken-word passages so laid back in tone it’s easy to miss their intent on a cursory listen. The juxtaposition between execution and content is effectively disarming, especially when she coos lines like: “If I get raped it must be my fault, and if I get bashed I must have provoked it.”</p>
<p>The ever-changing ways Winer deals with vocals on <i>Witch</i> are partly what makes it so inviting. At times they’re pure decoration, cut up and left scattered throughout the mix in a manner similar to techniques <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30806-holly-herndon/"">Holly Herndon</a> would become enamored with decades later (“Flove”). Elsewhere, she uses a blackened monotone and follows it with airy, wistful pining (“John Says”). There are trapping of the times that haven’t aged terribly well—one too many songs beginning with snatches of sampled dialogue, the attempt at going somewhere similar to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/138-art-of-noise/"">Art of Noise</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYyWykHNsAk&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Dragnet”</a> on “1nce Upon a Time”—but mostly there’s a mix of grace and spikiness that’s remarkably unfettered by time. The standout track is “5”, which takes anti-corporate and anti-war sentiment and mixes it up with a notable sample from the much-covered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22337-buffalo-springfield/"">Buffalo Springfield</a> track <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5JCrSXkJY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“For What It's Worth”</a>, neatly bringing parts of that song in line with sentiment that’s often inaccurately prescribed to it.</p>
<p>For someone who wasn’t shy in picking up large topics and making deeply personal statements within them, it’s a shame <i>Witch</i> didn’t connect to a wider audience. There’s a longing for connection here, a feeling that trip-hop, if Winer must be bracketed there, would have been a little richer with her in a more prominent position. In a sense it’s a bitter irony that this album is getting released again now, at a point where the reissue machine is in overdrive, where every album seems to come attached with a hard-luck story explaining why things didn’t work out as planned. If<i> </i>this music got lost in ‘93 due to an onrush of likeminded talent, it’s equally likely to be gasping for air this time around. It bolsters the context of <i>Witch</i> as an album that doesn’t really belong anywhere, a feeling mirrored in the singular way Winer expresses her fury—so calm, so assured, so in control. She’s in her own place, her own time, interpreting the world in a manner that has few parallels.</p></div>"|19339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19339-leslie-winer-witch/|7.6|Nick Neyland

The Swedish pop upsetter and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>-worthy robotic voice, something like a filthy-minded <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_(toy)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Speak &amp; Spell</a>, plainly stated that they wanted each other. Surrounded by hard-driven electronic beats and billowing synths, you could almost imagine them in some fantastical dance club, about to slip away into the shadows.</p>
<p>But <i>Do</i><i> It Again</i> is no chance encounter, as the singer born Robin Carlsson and the Norwegian duo of Svein Berge and Torbjørn Brundtland have taken oddly related trajectories. She's the former teen-pop star who ditched her label and struck out on her own, sparking the spectacular career resurgence that led to 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14917-body-talk/""><i>Body Talk</i></a> album trilogy; they're the early-2000s chillout-electronica guys who shrugged off easy categorization and increasingly worked more with vocalists, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/224-annie/"">Annie</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">the Knife</a>'s Karin Dreijer Andersson. When Robyn and Röyksopp finally recorded together on a couple of tracks in 2009 and 2010, it was a meeting between two veteran acts with a gift for making broad appeal feel almost coincidental.</p>
<p>This Scandinavian electro-pop trio's most extensive studio team-up so far digs deeper into that shared affinity for stylistic exploration, patient offhandedness, and a communicative, dancefloor-friendly pop sensibility. Though technically an EP, the 35-minute <i>Do It Again</i> has the epic sweep of a proper album, with contemplative instrumental passages helping frame the more conventional songwriting. Still, the noodlier bits belie the project's origins in the respective artists' post-album creative hangovers: the freedom they've given themselves on <i>Do It Again </i>is both what makes the record refreshing and what keeps it from satisfying listeners as a more streamlined full-length would. <i>Do It Again is </i>an excellent mini-album, then, but it's easy to suspect that the masterpiece will be the tour, with Robyn and Röyksopp each performing a set and then all taking the stage together. There could be <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/robyn/posts/10152233518937530"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pink lasers</a>.</p>
<p>Another way to approach <i>Do It Again</i> is as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_single"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">maxi single</a>. The title track lacks Robyn's usual knack for a strong, distinctive concept—just last year, Scotland's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/"">Camera Obscura</a> had a charming single with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15298-camera-obscura-do-it-again/"">same name</a>—but her ever-expressive, deeply felt vocals can make even strobe-lit ""one more time"" hedonism worth doing again. It's galloping, whooshing dance-pop, booming enough for festival EDM tents and melodic enough for spazzing out in front of laptop speakers, with an undercurrent of melancholy that makes it well worth pressing repeat. If the rest of the disc contained just remixes of ""Do It Again"", it'd still be some lustworthy vinyl.</p>
<p>But stopping at the title track would mean missing out on the rest that <i>Do It Again </i>has to offer. The relaxed format gives Robyn and Röyksopp space to sprawl out in some rewarding, if idiosyncratic, directions. Wordless finale ""Inside the Idle Hour Club"" is a moonlit synth-groove excursion that wouldn't have been out of place on Berge and Bruntland's 2010 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14624-senior/""><i>Senior</i></a>, and it's no slam to point out it would also be an ideal mellow interlude during a live show. ""Every Little Thing"" is something like a contemporary Italo-disco power ballad, as Robyn yearns in harmony with cyborg versions of herself. And the 10-minute ""Monument"" could turn out to be the set's most enduring track: Though the extended saxophone portion drags, Robyn's prophetic vision of the future here is unique in her catalog and deeply compelling. ""When the moment comes,"" she intones weightily, ""I can say I did all with love.""</p>
<p>Which brings us back to ""Sayit"", the one with the dirty-talking gadget. Robyn serenaded a ""Robotboy"" on a slightly twee track from her masterful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"">2005 self-titled album</a>. She was in love with a presumably metaphorical man-machine on her first Röyksopp collaboration, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11102-the-girl-and-the-robot/"">""The Girl and the Robot""</a>, from 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12860-junior/"">Junior</a> </i>(their other previous partnership came on ""None of Dem"", from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14294-body-talk-pt-1/""><i>Body Talk Pt. 1</i></a>). When this uncanny yet euphoric, four-on-the-floor raver's Wall-E equivalent calls himself a ""fuck mechanic,"" it's a rare moment of carnality in Robyn's discography, but it's also a silly joke. The more important phrase might be the one he utters right before: ""Pleasure machine."" If <i>Do It Again</i> is the physical artifact of Robyn and Röyksopp's union, it's extravagant and left of center, but it's above all generous. They did it all with love, for our pleasure. Or, as Robyn sings on ""Do It Again"", ""It hurts so good.""</p></div>"|19358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19358-royksopp-robyn-do-it-again/|7.7|Marc Hogan

The Durham, NC duo’s fusion of quirky folk and quirky electro-pop would have otherwise been inevitably and awkwardly willed into existence, since those are two of the most reliable, likeable, and syncable subgenres that fall under the “indie” umbrella. It’s a good starting point for Sylvan Esso, but it’s their endgame as well.</p>
<p>All the same, there is a guileless charm to the whole project and without it, there’s no way opener “Hey Mami” would be remotely tolerable. As Amelia Meath neatly manicures her syllables while singing, “Sooner or later/ The dudes at bodegas/ Will hold their lips and own this shit,” <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Whgn_iE5uc&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rob Thomas’ Mona Lisa is strutting through Spanish Harlem</a>. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Maybe the urbane playfulness is a stilted attempt to compensate for Sylvan Esso’s background in antiquated and Appalachian music</span>: Meath is a member of Vermont <i>au naturel</i> vocal group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28236-mountain-man/"">Mountain Man</a> and part of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist"">Feist</a>’s touring band, while Nick Sanborn plays bass in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/"">Megafaun</a>, often contrasted with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver"">Bon Iver</a> as the woolier, weirder offshoot of DeYarmond Edison. Fortunately, “Hey Mami” succeeds in being a folk song in an ethnomusical sense, a document of a real life situation. Meath’s looped vocals lend a languid, sun-weary, and slightly drunk quality, and it’s the ambient street noise rather than Sanborn’s protruding bass and skittering beats that evokes the scene they’re trying to relate. The same sense of place is crucial to “Coffee”, where Meath sings about the freedom of dancing as a participant, rather than an observer.</p>
<p>Most of Sylvan Esso’s points of comparison are contemporary and complimentary, but it’s easiest to draw a straight bloodline to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a>' indie R&amp;B O.G. “Stillness is the Move”, as Sylvan Esso’s sounds are thin and gawky, while dealing with small, tangible situations. Meath’s lyrics carry streak of homesickness and displacement, but it’s nothing existential or incomprehensible; judging from “Could I Be”, it’s just a matter of being on the road, because it’s there you’ll meet people like the carnivorous charmer who’s the subject of “Wolf”, saddled with obvious Zevon allusions and obvious metaphor (“But no birds or beasts does he eat/ he only wants the tenderest meat”). You can subsequently hear the chorus of “H.S.K.T.” (“Head, shoulders, knees and toes”) as a calming inventory to stay in the present moment while surrounded by the constant chatter of people, beeping cellphones, and televisions.</p>
<p>Unlike most of their sleeker, sizeable peers, Sylvan Esso is by and for portable electronic devices. Sanborn’s beats are a collection of “sound effects” rather than cohesive production or ambience<span>—</span>buzzing bazz, vacuums of synths, and the rest sounding like a shareware version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght"">TNGHT</a>. If <i>Sylvan Esso</i> sounds like rudimentary remixes of what could otherwise be casual and agreeable Mountain Man or Feist songs, well, that’s exactly how Sylvan Esso got started—Meath asked Sanborn, working under the rustic electro alias Made of Oak, to reconfigure Mountain Man’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15836-play-it-right/"">“Play it Right”</a> (included as the penultimate track here) and it grew into a full-fledged partnership.  </p>
<p>While it’s easy to view Sylvan Esso as longtime side musicians taking the lead, there’s a disappointing retreat towards inoffensive lap-pop after “Hey Mami” and “Dreamy Bruises” boldly announce their intentions. Once you get a grasp of what it is Sylvan Esso <i>do</i>, Sanborn’s production somehow manages to be both repetitive and unfocused, while Meath’s chants start to blend into an indistinct schoolyard chatter, percussive sibilance over melody; “Hey Mami” is by a large margin the most grating song here, and it’s the one that seems to stick. <i>Sylvan Esso</i> may represent a declaration of freedom and artistic renewal, but it doesn’t necessarily result in memorable songs.</p>
<p>Still, like raw milk, I can’t shake that the lack of homogenization, the small-batch “organic” presentation of <i>Sylvan Esso</i>, is the main draw.

Romanticizing the New York of decades past—never mind its taboo fetish clubs, celebrity­-filled S&amp;M dungeons, and the pervasive sexual landscape of pre­-Giuliani Manhattan—is a tricky task in 2014, when just a few clicks away are hundreds of no wave, post­-punk, and electroclash bands who were actually there at the time. <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/30925-haunted-hearts/"">Haunted Hearts</a> don’t exactly unearth the scabrous New York of yesteryear; rather, they become the Ghost of Manhattan's Past and fly us over punk, sex, rebellion, and death-marked love while never taking us deeply into it. </p>
<p class=""p1""><span>Still, it's honest music from the noise-­pop couple, both of whom come into this project having broadened their sound within their own respective bands. Dum Dum Girls’ LP from earlier this year, <span class=""s2""><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18912-dum-dum-girls-too-true"">Too True</a>,</i></span> featured Dee Dee moving out of the lo­-fi ‘60s girl­group and into lusher, dreamier decades, adding a slinky low range to her already powerful voice. Welchez’s work in Crocodiles, while still nipping at the heels of the Jesus and Mary Chain and other Ray Ban­-wearing bands of the ‘80s, expand its sonic range on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18411-crocodiles-crimes-of-passion/"">Crimes of Passion</a></i>. Call it holy matrimony, but husband and wife pull each back to the safe zone on <i>Initiation—</i>these songs sound good and comfy.

<p class=""p1"">They write at pain and pleasure fairly overtly in <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14635-something-that-feels-bad-is-something-that-feels-good/"">""Something That Feels Bad Is Something That Feels Good""</a> and continue in the same vein on ""Up Is Up (But So Is Down)."" The latter plays out like a scene from some '70s art house film with characters calling the ""trash man"" to ""get their garbage flowing"" and a mother who ""flushes all her fun to keep her brain from humming."" It's a lonely song that lazily gyrates to a drum shuffle that recalls just about everything J. Spaceman and Richard Ashcroft have ever done. There are a few surprises here, but their comfort with each other gives these songs a certain ease. Hang up red curtains, shine a flashlight on a tiny disco ball, throw on a sequin dress, and sway back and forth until you are on the same page with Haunted Hearts. That's the scene to set if you really want the blend of their voices and the hum of the synths to move you.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Problem is, the fuzzy approximations of heroin kisses and blissed­-out dreams just never find an identity of their own. When ""Johnny Jupiter"" comes on, just the name ""Johnny"" brings to mind one of the most iconic names used in music to being<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2lHt3YFIW4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> so cool</a>, to being <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrygAv93Ick&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">angry</a>, to being <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5kQ-keiNrg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a shooting star</a>, to name only a few. It speaks to Haunted Hearts' obsession with the knee-jerk signifiers that surround the record—devil-may-care anti-heroes, drag queens and Hubert Selby Jr. novels, intravenous parties and dead-eyed dancing. But it just stays so symmetrical. Dee Dee and Welchez sing about love in such a detached way, you won't know where their ennui ends and yours begins.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Dee Dee­-featured ballad ""Love Incognito"" is a welcome ray of sunshine. She finally opens up on the chorus with words plain and sweet, ""I see you/ Yes I do/ You didn't think I could."" Thanks to her energy on the chorus, the song blossoms out in a way the mid­tempo mod rock surrounding it never quite does. But it still all adds up to something so familiar and unspecific—straight songs whose subject matter beg them to be anything but. Maybe it's the intimacy they shared recording this together in their apartment while holed up over last winter, spinning krautrock and Spiritualized records that drove them so far away from the outside world and into themselves. On the closing epilogue ""Bring Me Down"", the couple coo to each other, ""Well you've been bad/ But you're the best I've ever had.""  It plays like the last song on a Love Mixtape they made for each other; a comp about Haunted Hearts' little secrets and favorite music that ultimately means more to Dee Dee and Welchez than anyone else.</p></div>"|19383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19383-haunted-hearts-initiation/|6.4|Jeremy D.

In hindsight, <i>Antipodes</i> wasn't so much a nod to Popstrangers’ southern-hemisphere heritage as the word’s proper geographic definition, with the band’s current home of London, England situated at the polar opposite location of their native soil. With Popstrangers’ big move to Blighty comes an equally pronounced uptick in ambition, resulting in a sophomore outing that’s decidedly more pop and less strange.</p>
<p>Trading in <i>Antipodes</i>’ frazzled fuzz for greater focus, <i>Fortuna</i>’s arrival is fortuitously timed to take over cranial-massage duties from your played-out copy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/"">Tame Impala</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17131-lonerism/""><i>Lonerism</i></a>. Popstrangers may not boast the headphone-blowing studio-science intricacy and widescreen wallop of Kevin Parker’s project (at least, not yet), but they both thrive on a similar balance of melancholy and bliss, with an emotional essence that’s heavy-hearted and lightheaded all the same. Building upon the dream-pop promise of <i>Antipodes</i>’ shimmering highlight, “Heaven”, <i>Fortuna</i>’s crystalline production complements Joel Flyger’s sharpened hooks with a richer sense of atmosphere and space; no matter how often it’s repeated, the incessant, indelible refrain of “Don’t Be Afraid” still feels like a surprise thanks to a strategic half-second pause on each chorus hit. And on the power-pop triumph <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16805-popstrangers-country-kills/"" target=""_blank"">“Country Kills""</a>, Flyger comes up with a national anti-anthem for guilt-ridden expats everywhere: “Oh my country will kill me now… but whatever.”</p>
<p>Alas, the more pristine presentation also carries the risk of leaving Popstrangers overexposed, which is problematic when the melodies just aren’t compelling enough to carry the day (like the breezy but inconsequential “Destine”), or, more frustratingly, when Flyger’s words fail him: “Tonight” could be <i>Fortuna</i>’s most immediate, irresistibly catchy song, but also its most lyrically clichéd, yet another in the long line of rock songs using a garden metaphor as a hippy-dippy signifier of the feminine mystique, <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">and describing desire as a ""disease."" </span></p>
<p>But for the most part, <i>Fortuna</i> projects a confidence and self-belief that wasn’t all that perceptible on the rough-hewn <i>Antipodes</i>; the swooning, arm-swaying chorus of “Her” even suggests latent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"">Oasis</a>-at-Knebworth fantasies. And while Popstrangers haven’t buffed off all their edges (see: the post-punky pair of “Distress” and “Right Babies”), the most patiently paced moments on <i>Fortuna</i> prove to be the most potent—like the intensifying, psychedelized surge “What’s On Your Mind,” which, like all good album closers, feels like a gateway toward something more splendorous. Hopefully, Popstrangers won’t have to uproot themselves halfway around the world again to get there.</p></div>"|19397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19397-popstrangers-fortuna/|6.9|Stuart Berman

Barreca's record was released on the obscure Palace of Lights imprint run by another musician operating in the mists of the Pacific Northwest, Kerry Leimer, who himself had self-released a handful of his own work.</p>
<p>Investigating Leimer’s albums—specifically, 1982’s <i>Land of Look Behind</i> and 1983’s <i>Imposed Order—</i>revealed a curious artist. While the pastoral synths might scan as those of a new age practitioner, the weird loops of bass and noise eddying throughout suggested someone with more avant-garde tendencies. And when the drums burst into those otherwise ambient pieces (<i>Look Behind</i> drew on field recordings made in Jamaica of nyabinghi drumming, while <i>Order</i> used drum machines), it complicated matters further. These albums are long out of print, so it makes sense that the erudite RVNG imprint—already responsible for reviving forgotten artists ranging from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15165-synthesist/"">Harald Grosskopf</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17157-music-is-painting-in-the-air/"">Franco Falsini</a>—would claim Leimer as one of their own.</p>
<p><i>A Period of Review (Original Recordings: 1975-1983)</i> posits K. Leimer as the American <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Eno</a>, and while there are sonic ties back to the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1467-faust/"">Faust</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27976-jon-hassel/"">Jon Hassell</a>, Eno is the only predecessor that Leimer admits to, telling writer Dave Segal in the liner notes: “None gave me more of a push than Eno, specifically…<i>No Pussyfooting</i>. The attractor was the loops: the loop provided an instant structure.” The Eno fandom is obvious on one of the set’s rare vocal pieces, “Lonely Boy,” where Leimer laments being a composer watching tiny lights blinking at him. “I don’t know what to do/ With instruments and all these wires,” he intones, even nailing Eno’s dry British deadpan. Another song title is perhaps too on the nose: “Eno’s Aviary.” </p>
<p>Despite that namecheck, there is something distinctly punk coursing through this compilation of thirty previously unreleased tracks. The sleeve art of other Palace of Lights releases (which RVNG also plans on compiling later this year) are odd pencil drawings: heads morphing into home stereos, diagrams where fingers become entangled with bass strings. It suggests that strange time period after the Sex Pistols exploded overseas but before punk crossed the Atlantic and crystallized into hardcore. Much like other punks of that era who didn’t really want to shove a pin through their nose, Leimer was more than a trained musician who simply wanted to vent frustration and make some noise with tape loops.</p>
<p>One of the set's pleasures is that although Leimer doesn’t quite know what to do with the  instruments on hand—primarily a Rickenbacker bass, a Mini Moog, Revox tape decks, and a handful of effects pedals—the results are entrancing. The drum machine beats feel primitive yet intuitive on pieces like “Entr’acte” and “Archie’s Dub”, which possess a strange layering of dub effects that bring to mind Eno’s collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"">David Byrne</a> on <i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i> (Leimer’s band <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/491409-Savant-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Savant</a> would explore that polyrhythmic sound even further). For an album featuring so many dreamlike, drifting passages, it’s startling to look at the runtimes and realize that only four pieces ever top the 4:30 mark; beautiful ambient tracks like “Almost Chinese”, “At Daybreak”, and “Two Voices” take you much further afield than their concise runtimes suggest.</p>
<p>These pieces most closely evoke the work of Roedelius and Moebius in Cluster: meditative, wistful, lovely, giving off gentle glimmers of light. In trying to think of the closest American corollary for this set, the possibility emerges that Kerry Leimer is one of the lone examples of American <i>kosmische</i> music, that elegant hybrid that falls somewhere between the Velvets-styled mesmerism of Can in the early '70s and the placid tones of new age music that arose in the next decade. It’s a sound that applies to mid-70s Cluster, Ash Ra Tempel, Popol Vuh, the second side of Kraftwerk’s <i>Autobahn</i>, and others. Yet while import copies of such records no doubt made their way back to the States, it’s rare to find the American version of such a sound. There’s cosmic overtones to be found in jazz from that era (Miles Davis’ “He Loved Him Madly” in particular) as well as from more academic composers like Terry Riley and Laurie Spiegel, but for most bands and musicians of that decade, <i>kosmische</i> seems to have not been emulated. In experiencing this evocative set some three decades later, Leimer’s music sounds like the road not taken.</p></div>"|19387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19387-k-leimer-a-period-of-review-original-recordings-1975-1983/|8.2|Andy Beta

When she sang, “The moral of the story is don't lie to me again,” on “Consolation Prize”, it was the “again” that stuck in your gut, suggesting a pattern of aggression and acquiescence that would not necessarily end with the song. Her voice toggled fluidly between brave and broken, dogged and defiant—often within the same line. She whispered, then jumped to a fierce vibrato that could stop an army. Disclosing her darkest moments proved both empowering and unnerving, as though startled by her own strength. Even on her debut, she displayed the poise of a pro.</p>
<p>As with so many singer-songwriters—for whom lyrics and vocals take primacy over every other element—Van Etten never sounded quite so self-assured musically. <i>Because I Was in Love</i> showcased her quiet vocals and surprisingly nimble guitarwork, with producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4566-greg-weeks/"">Greg Weeks</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1402-espers/"">Espers</a> mostly staying out of her way. That subdued sound was going to be impossible to sustain for another album, much less an entire career, so it seemed almost inevitable when she introduced a full-band sound, complete with flourishes of pedal steel, on her follow-up, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14690-epic/"">Epic</a></i>. On 2012’s career-making <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16233-tramp/"">Tramp</a></i>, she worked with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">National</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7136-aaron-dessner/"">Aaron Dessner</a> and emerged with her fullest and most fully realized album to date, even if it occasionally sounded overly decorous, even fussy. Her catalog has been a series of trials and experiments, driven by restlessness and perfectionism in equal measure, although weirdly the transitions between albums only serve to render each one more volatile and unpredictable.</p>
<p>It is, then, notable that Van Etten herself produced her fourth album, <i>Are We There</i>, with some assistance from Stewart Lerman. The two met while working on the second soundtrack to <i>Boardwalk Empire</i> and decamped to his New Jersey studio to record these new songs. Lerman’s work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4543-loudon-wainwright-iii/"">Loudon Wainwright III</a>, the Roches, and other singer-songwriters makes him a good fit for Van Etten, but perhaps more than any of her previous records<i> Are We There</i> sounds self-determined and self-directed. The music fits snugly against her vocals, with her guitar and piano foregrounded on opener “Afraid of Nothing”. As a result, these songs move fluidly and dramatically, but never ostentatiously. Even the woodwinds on “Tarifa” sound understated, as though careful not to distract from Van Etten’s performance.</p>
<p>It’s the most comfortable she’s sounded since <i>Because I Was in Love</i>, which is not to say the music lacks color or character. “Your Love Is Killing Me” is built on a Jenga-style assemblage of post-rock guitars and jittery snare taps, and even as it sprawls into a six-minute jam (her longest song to date), it never topples. Instead, the music only reinforces her repeated proclamation, “You tell me that you like it.” Elsewhere, <i>Are We There</i> softens and quietens. A purposefully stiff drum loop lends “Taking Chances” its brooding, conspiratorial tone, reining in the chorus and setting up an effective one-chord organ solo. The stark piano on “I Love You But I’m Lost” flutters nervously, as though reminding you that Van Etten’s whispers can convey screams. There is a live quality to the music, as though she has crafted each note with concerts in mind. Her songs emphasize the moment, both in the quality of her performance and in the rawness of her lyrics. As a result, <i>Are We There</i> may be her most present-tense album to date, her most immediate and urgent—the peak of a steady upward trajectory.</p>
<p>Even as she has settled into a successful solo career, Van Etten continues to write incisively about the volatility of love, with no loss of urgency or investment. Her songs tend to be excruciatingly confessional, largely indistinguishable from the singer herself, and <i>Are We There</i> reveals a new self-awareness with regard to her primary subject. On “I Know”, which features Van Etten alone on piano, she declares, “I sing about my fear and love and what it brings,” as though we didn’t know that already. On closer “Every Time the Sun Comes Up”, she asks, not entirely rhetorically, “People say I'm a one hit wonder, but what happens when I have two?” It’s a sly way to preempt any complaint that she has only one emotional or musical setting, but the next line turns the song upside-down: “I washed your dishes, then I shit in your bathroom.” Recently, Van Etten told Pitchfork that the line was originally <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9402-here-together-are-our-hearts-the-love-songs-of-sharon-van-etten/"">a joke with her band</a>, but it’s not hard to see why this incredibly anti-romantic line would have stayed in. It reveals the driving idea behind the album: It’s not the big moments that define or doom a relationship, but the everyday routines, the small sacrifices that accumulate over time, the stark realities of sharing your life with another person. You see them at their best and their worst, their most beautiful and their most vulgar. To her credit, Van Etten has never shrunk from this horrible and wonderful understanding.</p></div>"|19384.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19384-sharon-van-etten-are-we-there/|8.2|Stephen M.

The songs, mostly written by leader Alasdair MacLean, sounded as though they were recorded inexpensively but they didn’t sound careless; with rich, heavy reverb and careful arrangements, they had the whiff of a band with big ideas who didn’t yet have the resources to realize them. And so, instead, they huddled together in a rented room somewhere, turned on the tape machine, and created a world as best they could.</p>
<p><i>Suburban Light</i>, the first full-length by the Clientele, initially released in late 2000, gathered these early singles and some other stray tracks. It was a modest record that developed a small cult, one that would grow a little bit with each new Clientele record through the last decade. While the group always had a very specific and identifiable aesthetic, they never quite sounded like this again, if only because, once they were signed to labels and putting out albums, they began to record in proper studios. But while <i>Suburban Light</i> is a special record, it’s not surprising that, for many, it flew under the radar. For one, its core musical idea—guitar-centric indie pop enamored with the gently psychedelic 1960s (deep Beatles cuts, Donovan, Kinks, West Coast Art Pop Band) and the UK indie pop of the ’80s (Felt, Television Personalities)—isn’t exactly novel. It’s not hard to imagine hearing these songs casually and thinking “Sounds nice enough” and then moving on to something more immediately distinctive. But those who stop there are really missing out; <i>Suburban Light</i> is a very unusual record in its way, a perfectly realized amalgam of time, place, sound, and subject matter.</p>
<p>Clues to its enduring appeal can be found in its most immediately noticeable quality: the relentless repetition of a small handful of themes. Almost every song here mentions rain, and two do so in the titles; there are references to stars and eyes and gardens and light and leaves and silent motorways—elemental tools for building intimate pop songs. But instead of worrying about redundancy, Alasdair embraces the recurring images, and the cumulative effect over the course of the record is that the record feels very much like a specific place, somewhere you visit rather than something you listen in on. This, combined with the album’s rich, heavily reverbed sound, makes <i>Suburban Light</i> feel unusually enveloping.</p>
<p>MacLean has always been open about his influences: surrealist poetry, found-object art, the fathoms-deep atmosphere of Galaxie 500. From the surrealists he learned a rich vividness with language; lines like “Bicycles have drifted through these leaves still wet with rain” (from “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMBeQkgjNFc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bicycles</a>”) and “6 am in morningside, the first car rushes by/ We walk down to the garden and the sunlight fills your eyes” (from “<a>6am Morningside</a>”, included in the U.S. version of <i>Suburban Light</i> and here on the bonus disc) have an uncanny ability to put pictures in your head. <i>Suburban Light</i> is filled with such couplets, lines dripping with romantic yearning for something just out of reach paired with nostalgia for something slipping from memory. The freighted imagery inflates mundane objects and situations into impossibly grand tableaus; these songs invite you to look a little more deeply at your surroundings, to see how a few workers walking over a bridge at dawn might be connected to your own sense of dislocation.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>Suburban Light</i> evokes a lonely world. One of the reasons the record sounds so dreamlike is that the narrator is completely in his own head; he wanders lamp-lit streets and sees a carnival crowd dispersing but feels a million miles away. The scenes describing human contact seem to happen more in imagination than reality. So in addition to romanticizing the mundane, <i>Suburban Light</i> also makes moving through the world in solitude and observing it carefully seem like a state of grace.</p>
<p>Driving home all these quiet scenes and minute observations is music that is unfailingly gorgeous. MacLean is an inventive guitar player and he sings with real emotion, and he also has the songwriting chops to hang with his earlier pop heroes. Part of why <i>Suburban Light</i> feels so bound to memory is because the constructions of the songs hearkens back to an age when the right chord change, when paired with the precise melodic turn, counted for everything. The songs seem old in part because their melodic conception is from another era, one when competition for penning tunes was thick. And the extreme reverb, sometimes reminiscent of the ghost halo of echo surrounding voices in the Flamingos' “I Only Have Eyes for You”, evokes a particular era of radio, one we know now only filtered through many generations of media. </p>
<p>One of <i>Suburban Light</i>’s paradoxical qualities is that it’s not afraid of boredom. Because of its golden AM sonics, <i>Suburban Light</i> always exists on one level as ambiance, the kind of mildly bland prettiness you hear leaking from a beat-up transistor set to an oldies station. That quality, of past and present and foreground and background all existing at the same time, makes me think of a certain strand of atmospheric electronic music. MacLean has expressed great admiration for the music of Boards of Canada, but <i>Suburban Light</i> seems spiritually akin to something like <i>An Empty Bliss Beyond This World</i> by the Caretaker, the way it creates a stirring atmosphere that’s unsettling in its surface beauty while containing layers of deeper meaning. On the Clientele’s <i><a href=""http://theclientele.co.uk/lyrics/47/north-school-drive"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lost Weekend</a></i>, which contains tracks recorded around the same time as some of the songs here, there’s a brief sound collage with street noise called “Boring Postcard”. The title is a reference to Martin Parr’s <a href=""http://www.phaidon.com/store/photography/boring-postcards-9780714843902/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">book of the same name</a>, which presents selections from his collection of postcards gathered over the years, without comment. The book features <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=boring+postcards&amp;es_sm=119&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F7ODU5jBM7fMsQTNlYLABg&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=806"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ancient snapshots of roads and banks and hotel lobbies</a>, most of which are eerily empty; Clientele songs could be set in these places.</p>
<p>And now, thanks to Merge’s 25th anniversary reissue program, <i>Suburban Light</i> is back in print on vinyl, where it belongs. The bonus disc included here is universally excellent, and includes the tracks that were on the American version of <i>Suburban Light</i> as well as a few other singles that could have been on the record proper. It’s the definitive statement of early Clientele, and it underscores the kind of subtle brilliance this band was capable of. <i>Suburban Light</i> is ultimately about a particular way of seeing, of looking at your life from the outside while living inside of it, romanticizing events as they happen. All of which connects it firmly to the mindset of youth and young adulthood, when you’re straddling the space between hazy childhood and the uncertain future, inhabiting a world so lovely and unreal.</p></div>"|19257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19257-suburban-light/|9.1|Mark Richardson

The whole album has its eyes pointed over its shoulder or upward at a deity that may or may not be there, taking stock and setting the table for a possible next life in turn. These aren’t really new themes for an Echo &amp; the Bunnymen album, but they’ve never quite felt like this on one of their records before. They’ve been slowing down for a while now, but here they feel nearly worn out. </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Part of this may be down to the fact that for five albums now, the band has been reduced to a duo of McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant, and as distinctive as they both are, they miss the rhythmic push they used to get when they had a fully integrated rhythm section with as much creative agency in the band. Sergeant actually plays in another band, Poltergeist, with former Bunnymen bassist Les Pattinson, but the bass player’s absence is palpable here. Most of these tracks lumber along, and Sergeant has virtually nothing to play against.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">As for the overall sound, producer Youth might as well have a button on his mixing board labeled “Dave Fridmann."" The opening title track sounds a little like a <i>Yoshimi</i>-era Flaming Lips ballad that never quite reaches the overload of that band. Look through the track list and you’ll find a lot of portentous song titles—“Explosions,” “Burn It Down”, “Holy Moses”—but while the titles might conjure the powerful group that made <i>Heaven Up Here</i>, nothing here approaches that level of intensity. The part of the chorus to “Explosions” where McCulloch talks about erosion feels more descriptive of the processes at work in the music that the part where he talks about things blowing up.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">For his part, Sergeant is still a fine guitarist, but he really only gets a few chances to shine. “Market Town” pounds a lot harder than anything else on the album, and you can feel the energy it injects into his playing, while “Constantinople” is decked out in one of his signature pastiches of Arabic melody. McCulloch seems to have picked the title of “Constantinople” for the word itself and not for any of its meaning; he even reminds himself that it’s now called Istanbul.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">When they first reunited in 1997, I never figured I’d still be listening to new Echo &amp; the Bunnymen records almost twenty years later, and I still like hearing that voice and that guitar. But the band ran out of things to prove a long time ago, and as uncertain as the lyrics have become, the music has largely drifted into a comfort zone the band can’t quite coax itself out of.</p></div>"|19391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19391-echo-and-the-bunnymen-meteorites/|6.0|Joe Tangari

Though Stephen O’ Malley, Randall Dunn, and Oren Ambarchi have exhausting rosters of collaborations and contributions, their respective drone-and-doom credits remain preeminent for many. O’ Malley, for instance, is best known for co-founding the metal monolith <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>, a band that Dunn not only records in the studio but engineers and mixes on the stage, too, serving as a shadowed albeit essential auxiliary member. Ambarchi, an Australian multi-instrumentalist with an insatiable taste for new musical idioms and approaches, seems to release another album every quarter; still, to casual listeners, he’s most associated with powerful contributions to the most recent Sunn O))) albums or, at best, a set of LPs released through the band’s own Southern Lord mothership a decade ago.</p>
<p>So, then, <i>Shade Themes</i> satisfies its stylistic prerequisites by closing with “Ebona Pagoda,” an ultra-coruscant reduction of the epics that shape as Sunn O)))’s core. Gently distorted guitars hang like fog over oscillating peals of organ. When those sounds intersect at just the right angle, the hum breaks through the amplified haze like sunlight, the solitary beams refracted into infinity. It’s beautiful, but that’s not the reason you should listen to <i>Shade Themes</i>.</p>
<p>Instead, this trio’s collective résumé turns the preceding four tracks into a wonderland of intrigue, where disparate influences twist and turn into uncanny phantasms. O’Malley, Dunn and Ambarchi initially composed these pieces for <i>Kairos</i>, <a href=""http://alexisds.com/?page_id=733"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the film component of an extended multimedia project</a> by Belgian artist Alexis Destoop. In the film, time is mined like minerals and commodified for a society that’s already ruined it. The trio based their score around unedited footage, responding to scenarios and scenes in a process that allowed, Destoop notes, “a blurring of the line between diegetic and non-diegetic sound.” That’s not the only line that the group blurred: This hour of music reaches wide to pull together strands from the trio’s expansive orbit of enthusiasms and experiences.</p>
<p>There’s the aforementioned tidal drone and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag9C8nTebZk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the occult choogle</a> that Dunn conjures with his own Master Musicians of Bukkake. There’s the space-warping electronica experiments endemic to some of Ambarchi’s best work, and the agile bullying of Nazoranai, O’Malley and Ambarchi’s trio with their spirit guide into directed discursion, Keiji Haino. Throughout <i>Shade Themes</i>, it’s possible to detect dub and IDM, krautrock and Sufi trance, Fluxus-like collage and, of course, a little rock ’n’ roll gusto, all within the same track.</p>
<p>This composite approach especially directs the album’s first half. Opener “The Space Between” disorients Spaghetti Western themes, bending guitar leads around beats that mope like reggae on tranquilizers. “Temporal, Eponymous” balances twitchy noise-rock with a rhythm section that favors hypnotic repetition, casting a spell of unequal parts meditation and agitation. But the most brilliant instance of this stylistic frisson comes at the album’s center, near the middle of “Circumstances of Faith”. For five minutes, the trio works through an electroacoustic mirage, suggesting the pioneering archives O’Malley has reissued of late through Recollections GRM. When Ambarchi’s drums finally arrive, however, he presses against the din until he disrupts it, leaving only a throbbing bass and a coiled wire of noise suspended against the silence. A guitar suddenly moans across the room. The band seems at the edge of eruption. It’s only a tease. Instead of bedlam, tablas percolate, doubling and tripling the meter and pushing the trio toward an unseen drum-jam crescendo.</p>
<p>Sandwiched between these instrumental collages and curves sits “Sometimes,” one of the most surprising pieces in any of these musician’s respective catalogues. The delicate voice of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ai-Aso/109058329200367"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Japanese singer-songwriter Ai Aso</a> arrives like a whisper spoken too loudly. She threads through a lacelike latticework of processed acoustic guitar plucks, microscopic electronic clicks and drums brushed so delicately they barely register. It’s prismatic chamber folk, rendered so as to split the difference between the austere electroacoustic stable of Touch and the deliberate motion of fellow Drag City songwriter Bill Callahan. Again, there are precedents for this sound with all three principals here: O’Malley released <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/artist/ai-aso"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aso’s wonderful <i>Lone</i></a> earlier this year, Dunn produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16662-the-sister/"" target=""_blank"">Marissa Nadler’s exquisite <i>July</i></a>, and in 2012, Ambarchi began his own <i>Audience of One </i>with<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUa-lVFJlR0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> “Salt”</a>, a patient pop stunner that wouldn’t feel out of place sung by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"">James Blake</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>.  Still, “Sometimes” sits like the solitary bloom in a warzone, a focal point of beauty in a landscape of ordered disorder.</p>
<p><i>Shade Themes from Kairos</i> arrives five years after this trio first gathered in an abandoned radio studio in Belgium, accompanied by an army of equipment. Given the schedules that these three keep, it seems unlikely that they’ll find a similar furlough and charge anytime soon. Just this year, Ambarchi has already released <a href=""http://www.blacktrufflerecords.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two albums</a>, while O’Malley is <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/14943-stephen-o-malley-aluk-todolo-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">preparing for a reboot</a> of Sunn O))). Dunn is emerging not only as a go-to producer for metal but also for indie acts looking to add more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18046-akronfamily-sub-verses/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18046-akronfamily-sub-verses/"" target=""_blank"">edge</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19161-pink-mountaintops-get-back/"" target=""_blank"">atmosphere</a>. That’s too bad. Together, this trio excels not just at the expected but also delights in the quest to find a common vernacular amid multiple musical languages. That’s the challenge <i>and</i> the charm of <i>Shade Themes from Kairos</i>, a record that minds borders only long enough to maneuver around them.    </p></div>"|19349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19349-oren-ambarchi-stephen-omalley-randall-dunn-shade-themes-from-kairos/|7.4|Grayson Haver Currin

Like many Northern cities that were second-or-third tier destinations for Black Americans during the Second Great Migration from the '40s through the '70s, Seattle had to strain its soul and funk through ""unofficially"" segregated clubs and scenes, and the opportunities for nationwide breakthroughs to emerge out of a regional touring itinerary were slim at best. But </span><i>Wheedle's Groove </i><span>collected more than enough gems to prove that the Emerald City could pull off raw soul, searing balladry, and spaced-out funk with a panache that could go toe-to-toe with any scene Northwest of Memphis.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>After nine years and a vise-tight All-Star jam session that resulted in an album, </span><i>Kearney Barton</i><span>, by a Seattle-vet band that took on the Wheedle's Groove name, it's high time that Light in the Attic assembled a sequel. Since the old-school soul milieu well represented in the first volume, </span><i>Wheedle's Groove Volume II </i><span>takes on the sounds that emerged and dominated the second half of the '70s and the early-mid '80s—Quiet Storm, boogie funk, disco, electro, and all the places they intersected. If that brings up thoughts of a transition into supersmooth, superslick machinations towards crossover hitmaking and dancefloor-dominated monomania, rest assured that </span><i>Volume II </i><span>showcases artists that either bucked the trend or made the absolute most of it. It's real get-down music, and it's not nearly as lo-fi or low-tech as the 45s that filled out the first volume. But it's clear that even with half a generation's worth of musical trend shifts, these musicians come from the same stock as their grittier predecessors.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In a few cases, the connections are literal, as a couple of the artists who were too notable to be contained to just one volume show up for a repeat engagement, with a slow jam-turned-marathon vamp by Robbie Hill's Family Affair, ""Don't Give Up,"" given the closing-slot honors by compiler DJ Supreme La Rock. The upbeat shades-of-Sly vibe as heard on the first volume's 1972 cut ""I Just Want to Be (Like Myself)"" gives way for a circa-'75 session track produced by the Main Ingredient (of ""Everybody Plays the Fool"" renown), with rapid-panning Fender Rhodes, glimmering guitar riffs, and an extended flute solo giving its velvet-soul smoothness a kinship with the jazz-funk that Blue Note was plying around the same time. Another encore highlight comes from Cold, Bold, &amp; Together, whose ""Let's Backtrack"" accounts for the 1972 boundary of the compilation's timeline and, despite being something of a stylistic outlier, packs a strong mixture of unpolished suaveness in its rangy, falsetto-pierced harmonies—and <span> its high-in-the-mix 4/4 conga groove and cymbal rides</span> points at what was to come in popular music afterwards.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That creeping sense of the then-future is why it's worth noting that once things get to flat-out late '70s disco territory, the Seattle scene's transition from live bands to DJs —and the ensuing pressure for bands to adapt or lose out entirely—had an effect that wasn't entirely detrimental. As the bulk of this collection reveals, a lot of musicians gravitate towards the boogie during the disco era, and without necessarily shedding the things that made them funky. Honey-sweet harmonies and hip-bumping drum kicks mesh with filthy basslines and fluid solo-flinging virtuosity, which is where cuts like Steppen Stones' ""Darlin Oh Darlin"" and Deuce's ""Your Love Is Fine (Lovin' Fine)""—the latter written by singer-turned-public TV producer Cleve Ticeson in a rush of Baha'i-stoked inspiration—really shine. There's a fair share of comparatively glossier material, too: '78-vintage cuts like Epicentre's sprightly ""Get Off the Phone"" (sung by Bernadette Bascom, who came up with the touring band for Philly disco-soul progenitors People's Choice) and Don Brown's Boz Scaggs-ian blue-eyed beardo pop-soul ""Don't Lose Your Love"" might not be what rare-groove types fiend for, but it's not hard to imagine them sounding like the better entries in a block of decade's-end Top 40 radio.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>From there, it's just a quick step or two to the stripped-down turn towards synthesized grooves that made funk both more futuristic and more budget-conscious in the '80s. The less-heralded versions of the sounds emerging from L.A. and Minneapolis are well-represented here, and widely represented, too: on the more wigged-out end of the spectrum, there's the new wave-leaning electro of Teleclere's 1983 ""Steal Your Love"", which pinpoints an ideal midpoint between Prince's worked-up simmer circa </span><i>Dirty Mind </i><span>and the cold steel machine-man tech-noir of Cybotron's Detroit proto-techno. On the other end sits Septimus' 1987 ""Here I Go Again"", a presumed pop-crossover candidate that still has a punchy slap-bass and buoyant congas cutting through its drum-machine beat to connect the band back to their early '70s origins. And Malik Din's enigmatic ""Trouble in Mind"" sits somewhere in between, with rap-sung soprano vocals (uncannily reminiscent of one Curtis Mayfield) and chirpy synths skewing slick while the jittery, anxious digital percussion keeps poppers popping and breakers breaking. The 2,700-miles-from-Miami bass of ""Baby Got Back"" sounds a lot less out-of-nowhere once you hear this stuff.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The first volume of </span><i>Wheedle's Groove </i><span>fits nicely in the tradition of rare-funk comps—lots of who-did-what dot-connecting, shout-outs to pivotal clubs and production studios, tons of dusted-off promo photos—and </span><i>Volume II </i><span>lives up to its predecessor in that respect, as Jonathan Zwickel's liner notes give due credit while avoiding excessive reverence. And just as </span><i>Wheedle's Groove</i><span>'s own sense of Seattle's oddball place in the funk world first hinged on a title track that was eventually associated with the city's underdog sports culture (see: the '78 SuperSonics' NBA Finals run), there's a jock-novelty cut here that's far better than it has any right to be, as Lenny Randle headlines a chorus of his fellow 1981 Mariners in a titular disco-rap tribute to the then-futuristic Kingdome. The Seattle funk scene might not have been a nationally renowned hotbed, but this collection proves that finding so many lost gems the first time around wasn't just a fluke.</span></p></div>"|19371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19371-wheedles-groove-seattle-funk-soul-modern-boogie-volume-ii-1972-1987/|8.1|Nate Patrin

Before that, he operated under the pseudonym <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1638-final-fantasy/"">Final Fantasy</a>, until <a href=""http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=173144"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Square Enix rights holders objected</a>. The ""Owen Pallett"" of <i>Heartland</i>, however, was still a figure essentially rooted in fantasy: the album told the first-person story of Lewis, a self-aware fictional character who does battle with the God of his universe. (The God's name? Owen Pallett.) Pallett's presence was a dramatic construct, in other words, meditating on authorship and agency, and the fact that the songs were set in Spectrum, a 14th-century country Pallett invented, added another distancing tool.  There was powerful, communicative pop songwriting on <i>Heartland</i>, but Pallett built the album like a logic maze, perhaps so we could never locate him inside it.</p>
<p>On <i>In Conflict</i>, Pallett mostly steps free of his own labyrinth. The album is mournful and restrained in tone, featuring his most pleading and open vocal performances. The lyrics, meanwhile, veer often into excruciatingly personal territory:  On ""The Passions,"" he invites us into his bedroom while someone goes down on him. ""You hook your pinkies in my jeans/ I'm 28 and you're nineteen,"" he croons. If <i>Heartland</i> had him tentatively dangling a foot in autobiography, <i>In Conflict</i> finds Pallett taking a running leap off the dock.</p>
<p>""I was inspired by my interactions with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6649-john-darnielle/"">John Darnielle</a> while on tour with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2845-the-mountain-goats/"">the Mountain Goats</a>,"" he told <i>the New York Times' T Magazine</i> about the decision to dig deeper into his own soul. ""He has this apparatus in his brain that turns the most inconsequential life events into magic."" ""Apparatus"" is a very Pallett-ian word choice, offering a peek into how his mind grasps the minds of others. He thrives on processes and structures; his music can sometimes feel like a series of rigged gizmos. To see Pallett live is to be equally dazzled and mowed over—looping violin lines in real time, singing and playing and stomping pedals and band leading and dryly joking, all at once. You are so astonished that sometimes you forget to be moved.</p>
<p>He's less concerned with dazzling us this time around, and as a result he moves us more. His looped violin is still the DNA of the music, but the giddiness has been carefully siphoned from it: The arrangements are far simpler and cleaner, highlighting his beautiful, long-breathed melody writing. On ""Song for Five and Six"", he croons ""The sun has set on me,"" in a delicate head-voice, the rising melody cutting straight to bone. That same effortless falsetto lifts the stepwise melody of ""Infernal Fantasy"" heavenward and invests the big power ballad arc of ""The Secret Seven"" with profound ache. If nothing else, <i>In Conflict </i>is a fantastic argument for Pallett's virtues as a pure pop singer. </p>
<p>Even in ""confessional"" songwriting mode, however, Pallett is still heavily allegorical and occasionally inscrutable.  For every straightforward-sounding admission, like ""I'll never have any children/ I will bear them and confuse them"" from ""I Am Not Afraid"", there are stretches like this, from ""On A Path"": ""Dig, dig for silver in the name of keeping the order/ Silver is nothing more than the displacement of water/ It's a trick of the light on the face of your daughter and/ Or your son."" Pallett's lyrics teem with thick bands of language that act like yellow lights in the listener's rush to associate him directly with any of the album's narrators.  </p>
<p>By the end of <i>In Conflict</i>, it's not clear which of the album's characters is Owen Pallett—or, if they're all just mini-Owens carrying pieces of Pallett with them. At least one of them calls him out directly: ""Owen, where were you to stop the fire?"" he wails on ""Infernal Fantasy"", a song that talks, as many of these songs do, about tortured lust. The overall effect is less layers of a brilliant puzzle and more shattered mirror shards.  </p>
<p>There are traces of blood here, too, and at least some of it is Pallett's. ""The world will forget any good you have done,"" he assures us bleakly on ""The Riverbed"". ""There's a gap between what a man want and what a man will receive,"" he muses on ""Song for Five and Six"". ""You stand in a city that you don't know anymore/ Spending every year bent over from the weight of the year before,"" he sings on ""On A Path,"" a line that becomes, slowly, ""I stood for a city but I don't know anymore.""</p>
<p>Over time, <i>In Conflict</i> reveals a series of oblique takes on volatile private emotions—sexual need, spiritual exhaustion, reflections on mortality. It's fitting that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, the original oblique strategist, joined Pallett for these sessions; besides gracing the album with some clear Eno touches (the tumbling chorale of ""By bill, by vote"" on ""On A Path,"" the <i>Remain in Light</i>-reminiscent chanting ""Wait for sunlight"" on ""Infernal Fantasy""), he shares Pallett's belief that the best way forward is at an acute angle. <i>In Conflict</i> might not be an autobiography the way you or I would write it, but make no mistake: the deeper you look into it, the deeper Pallett himself stares back at you.</p></div>"|19395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19395-owen-pallett-in-conflict/|8.0|Jayson Greene

Many of the people he frustrates, specifically, are folks who latched onto his music back when his magnificent debut, the Exile-produced <i>Below the Heavens</i>, left a permanent dent in their subconscious. Blu's jumped through a succession of sideways evolutions and detours-turned-thoroughfares ever since; even his much-awaited Exile reunion <i>Give Me My Flowers While I Can Still Smell Them </i>saw a premature, lo-fi release on Bandcamp before seeing a proper release a year later.</p>

The album operates under a concept that, typically, either results in </span><i>pro forma </i><span>nostalgia or immediately resonant memory restoration: a West Coast rap ""Back to the roots"" homecoming, hence the title. </span><i>Good to Be Home </i><span>doesn't really fall under either category, though—instead, Blu's gathering memories he found spilling out of an old shoebox and taking stock without feeling the need to tie any of it together. The end result is too vague to resemble overt wistfulness, or for that matter, a uniquely insightful autobiography—the latter of which he nailed amazingly on his and producer Mainframe's 2008 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12592-johnsonjonson/"">self-titled effort</a> as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27283-johnsonjonson/"">Johnson&amp;Jonson</a>. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Good to Be Home</i><span> does possess a certain duality, revisiting a hazy-yet-formative Angeleno G-funk upbringing while filtering it through the lens of abstracted, flow-first free-association lyrics and dusty-soul production that keeps in line with the L.A. underground. The juxtaposition makes sense; Blu's always integrated a contradictory complexity into his persona, struggling between frustration and triumph, widescreen observations and introverted tunnel-vision focus. He builds ancillary details into perceptive storytelling or, inversely, breaks down the big picture into separate components. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>An indie auteur too mercurial for the majors cutting his teeth on Pac isn't unheard of, but it points to an intriguing artistic backstory that Blu could conceivably give vivid insight into. Unfortunately, he doesn't. He's equally talented at constructing personal, detail-riddled narrative lyricism as he is spinning impressionistic takes on his daily existence; those gifts work best when paired in tandem, but when he operates almost exclusively in the latter mode, he generalizes his more human-sounding sentiments instead of owning them powerfully. ""The West"" finds Blu simultaneously looking at yesterday and tomorrow, blending memories of his parents' disapproval with his unaffiliated, gangsta-coded gear (""Sagged and rocked rags when my folks ain't condone it"") with rapidfire shifts in focus. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But it often takes deeper readings between the lines to find the sparse details on <i>Good to Be Home </i>that listeners who aren't '80s L.A. babies can latch on to. The thematic focus on youthful rap-steeped cockiness rolls along aimlessly like an unplanned weekday teenage summer evening spent driving without a destination, the first half's steady stream of N.W.A. memories and driver's-seat sermons (""The Return"", ""Boyz N the Hood"", ""Whip Creme"") coasting on Daytons that look like they're standing still even when the car's rolling. Influences frequently emerge, from pop-rap standbys (Skee-Lo's ""I Wish"", DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince's ""Summertime"") to bicoastal street-rap canon fodder (Nas' ""Life's a Bitch"", Ice Cube's ""It Was a Good Day"").</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Blu is clearly focused in his intensity when he rattles off these pieces of a past that haven't entirely vanished from his present. The beats from relative unknown Bombay aren't that innovative or surprising; when he's not on some under-quantized, shrill-stringed, obscure-soul-loop I Can't Believe It's Not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> business, he's reaching for known quantities like Kool &amp; the Gang's ""Summer Madness"" or Gil Scott-Heron's ""Angel Dust"". But Blu's dedication to Blake Griffin-ing every syllable and punching in the internal rhymes like a Tekken combo keeps the momentum charging ahead. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On those rare moments where Bombay keeps the beat sparse, like the melted-on-the-dashboard G-funk creep of ""Rap Dope,"" the individuality that's sometimes missing in Blu's lyrics springs out in his voice, the past tense of his memories' waypoints rattled off with the snarl of someone yet to come down from the adrenaline high and the ensuing rush. Maybe that's the point: </span><i>Good to Be Home</i><span>'s recollections are only meant to be alluded to, a summer-jam album riddled with familiar nods to shared experiences but still walled off from observers who think they really know Blu.</span></p></div>"|19297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19297-blu-good-to-be-home/|6.5|Nate Patrin

However, while the band is barely two years old, it’s not premature to suggest that Future Death are capable of pulling off a Lips-like evolution from acid-punk misfits to balloon-popping art-rock visionaries.</p>
<p>Like their 2013 self-titled EP, Future Death’s debut full-length <i>Special Victim</i> favors unapologetically tinny, distorted production that suggests it was captured on an iPhone Voice Memos app and replayed at internal-speaker-frying volume. (It was actually recorded at a former Dallas funeral home-turned-studio owned by indie super-producer John Congleton, possibly from inside one of the leftover coffins.) But rather than flatten out their sound, the limited sonic range mostly accentuates the increasingly sophisticated songcraft trying to poke through the surface squall.</p>
<p>Much of that first EP was written by drummer Alton Jenkins and guitarist Bill Kenny prior to the arrival of bassist Jeremy Humphries and Craiglist-sourced vocalist Angie Kang—and yet, the fact that <i>Special Victim</i> was a complete group effort only serves to amplify the band’s inherent contradictions. Future Death often sound like a band at war with itself, exhibiting the form of a prog-rock act but the lo-fi ferocity of a garage-punk band, as Kang’s beaming, sugar-coated melodies are brutally pushed around by the convulsing arrangements like a pinball permanently caught between two bumpers. With the blissfully berserker opener “Riot Trains”, the joyride abandon of “Basements”, and cymbal-crashing fireworks of “Roman Devices,” Future Death effectively pair the in-the-red assault of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31732-perfect-pussy/"">Perfect Pussy</a> with the see-saw, guitar-scrambled sing-alongs of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5136-marnie-stern/"">Marnie Stern</a>, rendering anarchy and ecstasy as one and the same.</p>
<p>The pancaked production doesn’t always complement Future Death's songs; at times, it renders the band’s boundless energy as an indistinct blur. (In particular, the compulsively contorting “Speedweed” begs for greater clarity that would allow Jenkins’ oft-astonishing Zach Hill/Greg Saunier-inspired stickwork to propel the song, rather than be reduced to background clatter that clashes with Kang’s chorus line.) But you can also hear the band pushing against their preset parameters to open up their sound into unchartered territory: “Junkhummer” begins as a shrill, staccato math-punk pummel but, two minutes in, Jenkins trips up the beat and sends the song spinning off into a delirious extended coda, with Kang’s voice smeared into the sort of eerie, oscillating screams you’d hear from riders trapped on a malfunctioning amusement-park ride. In terms of confidence and scope (if not fidelty), <i>Special Victim</i> is an impressive step up from Future Death’s inaugural EP outing—but, as their band name not too subtly suggests, the truly killer stuff could still be to come.</p></div>"|19368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19368-future-death-special-victim/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Some will resemble 1970s psychedelia a la the Steve Miller Band; some the breastbeating passions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"">Depeche Mode</a>; some New Age, some disco with the flamboyance toned down and sequined unitards replaced by breathable hemp tees. Everything feels engineered for a kind of <a href=""http://image1.redbull.com/rbcom/010/2013-07-24/1331603432836_2/0010/1/1200/800/2/prins-thomas.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stoned wonder</a>, like something you might encounter during an evening show at the planetarium.</p>
<p>Pigeonholed as ""space disco""—a term addressing the idea that this is music people might want to dance or relax to in equal measure—the truth of the music is, as is often the case, messier and less catchy. ""When I started playing out again around '93, I didn't know any other way to do it than to mix it up,"" Pupp's founder, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/"">Prins Thomas</a>, once said. ""I was playing stuff from <i>Bitches Brew </i>together with early acid house and Beatles instrumentals."" That nobody vaudeville-hooked him off the stage with a cane suggests he was onto something, and in the intervening years, Pupp became known as a place less concerned with the orthodoxy of house and techno than with all the genres that surround them, constellated like stars in playful, inventive ways.</p>
<p><i>10 Years</i> is divided into two mixes edited by Thomas, half old material and half new, blended together. For those who have been paying attention, some of these names will be familiar: Thomas, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5718-diskjokke/"">diskJokke</a>, Blackbelt Andersen, Casiokids, Øyvind Morken, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15376-andre-bratten-aegis/"">Andre Bratten</a>—none of them besides Thomas having strong individual recognition but all friends at the party, releasing a single or two a year and the occasional album. A few entries—Randaberg Ego Ensemble's ""You Can't Do It Right,"" for example—are by artists who haven't put out anything since 2007, and have only ever released with Full Pupp. The impression here is more of a community than a business, of sly Norwegians twisting out their troubles in the dark.</p>
<p>These mixes are good companions. The tempos are closer to walking pace than anything else, and the occasional climax fizzes away like mist. It's slow compared to a lot of techno but rarely feels heavy, in part because it spends a good amount of time laughing. Amidst the serious prog-rock intimations of the void are boing-boing noises and Copacabana beats to remind you that the first thing on their agenda is fun—as is the second and likely the third, if they have not thrown the agenda in the trash by now or gotten it messy with cake. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"">Todd Terje</a>, who also tends to serve his epiphanies with a joke, released his first singles with Full Pupp, and is missed. Note also that ""pupp"" in Norwegian means ""tit,"" though what ""full tit"" means is a question best enjoyed by the imagination.)</p>
<p>""If you play within the style of techno than you have to be really good, because there's a lot of really good techno DJs,"" Thomas once said in an interview, adding, ""I'm more like a piano bar entertainer."" Like Terje and several of his other peers, Thomas comes off like a goofball who uses self-deprecation to avoid how boring it can be to bear your soul and have others bear theirs to you. His sleight of hand is that he's more clever than he lets on. </p></div>"|19092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19092-10-years-of-full-pupp/|7.6|Mike Powell

But nearly a quarter-century after <a href=""http://deadfrommayhem.ru/pages/en/bio.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dead made good on his name</a>, the characters and the contents of black metal have evolved. Knotty, nasty fury has given rise to bands who couch assaults in pretty, dramatic shapes—shoegaze atmospherics, electronic environments, symphonic structures.</p>
<p>Early last year, Markus Siegenhort, leader of the German black metal explorers <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lantlos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lantlôs</a>, elected to split with one member not through torture or even a tantrum, but instead <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lantlos/posts/10151303150904830"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">through a fawning email.</a> “I am very thankful, not only for your singing, but also for pushing the band and last but definitely(!) not least for your friendship. … Though, we can’t go on like this,” he wrote. “I hope you understand our/my situation and don’t see this as total cut on all edges. I still like you as a person and still want to be friends. Needless to say this!!!”</p>
<p>The singer receiving the email was Neige, the leader of France’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5913-alcest/"">Alcest</a> and one of the key figures in carrying black metal past its atavistic beginnings. In Lantlôs, <a href=""http://www.decibelmagazine.com/featured/herbst-lantlos-interviewed/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he shared vocals</a> with Siegenhort for 2010’s <i>.neon</i> and 2011’s <i>Agape</i>, albums that countered roars with post-rock drama and jazz redirection to varying degrees. With his own project, Neige had moved steadily from the belligerent black metal of his youth to gentle, sophisticated, metal-barbed rock. But with Lantlôs, he could still scream. Now they didn’t need him anymore. “I want to do vocals on this thing,” Siegenhort wrote to Neige of the next album. “I am so proud and I feel like my voice suits the music that I feel like it was nonsense giving it away for the sheer sake of friendship.”</p>
<p>Given the genteel manner of Neige’s excommunication, it seems needlessly provocative to suggest an emerging rivalry between Alcest and Lantlôs. But their respective new records do just that. Released in January, Alcest’s <i>Shelter</i> found Neige stepping cleanly out of his shadowed past to coo over washes of reverb-tempered distortion and arpeggio splendor. <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1617782/deconstructing-alcests-shelter-and-metal-in-a-post-deafheaven-world/franchises/deconstructing/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">He committed so fully</a> to the saturated sound of shoegaze and the ascent of post-rock that he recorded <i>Shelter</i> in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur Rós</a>’ own Icelandic bubble with guest vocals from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"">Slowdive</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1878-neil-halstead/"">Neil Halstead</a>. In spite of the ostentatious production, though, <i>Shelter</i> sounded thin and hesitant, a concession to obsessions rather than a victory over them.</p>
<p>On <i>Melting Sun</i>, Lantlôs’ fourth and most cohesive album, Siegenhort likewise sings sans ire, his mid-range croon ferried upward by a set of gentle effects. As with Alcest, Lantlôs has largely let go of the black metal to be found on those earlier albums. Now a trio, the band has retained a love of shrieking-and-stacked guitars, though they now flood less-claustrophobic post-rock forms in order to arrive at a sort of over-amplified and intoxicating dream pop. Where Alcest’s own step into the light revealed a withering paleness, <i>Melting Sun</i> is sanguine and bracing, an album that doesn’t lose power simply because the band has discarded a once-central element of its sound. Siegenhort was right: Lantlôs <i>didn’t</i> need Neige, after all.</p>
<p>Lantlôs runs on efficiency during <i>Melting Sun</i>. In the past, they’ve slipped into tangents that, to some extent, only showed just how beyond metal they’d gone—into the era of electric <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles</a>, the atmospheres of krautrock, the brow-beatings of doom. But for these six tracks, they smartly splice those influences into one another, a move that maintains momentum. The most aggressive bits bear texture, and the most billowing moments don’t float too far afield. Lantlôs finds unexpected ways to link hooks and heaviness while mostly splitting the space between them.  “Jade Fields,” for instance, cycles through celestial harmonies and refracted, kaleidoscopic guitar notes that suggest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11361-dustin-wong/http://pitchfork.com/artists/11361-dustin-wong/"">Dustin Wong</a>, but the rhythm section beneath them is a coil of muscle. A minute into “Cherry Quartz”, Lantlôs races through one of the album’s few black metal spans. Beneath the harsh haze, though, there’s a romantic slide guitar part, the bait left waving in the wind. The moment suggests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5025-the-twilight-sad/"">the Twilight Sad</a> sporting full sleeves. Even closer “Golden Mind"", which drifts into a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"">Beach House</a>-esque reverie, carries a vaguely sinister air.</p>
<p>At the midsection of “Aquamarine Towers”, the three-piece shifts instantly out of a march, turning the meter into a trap of tripwires and the riff into electronic noise that creeps like volunteer vines. The moment suggests that Lantlôs should be the next ostensible “metal” act on Thrill Jockey, a label that’s managed to move between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3187-oval/"">Oval</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10726-the-body/"">the Body</a> during the last few years. After all, such willful hybridization is what ultimately makes <i>Melting Sun</i> so much more compelling than <i>Shelter</i>, the latter which follows a definitive stylistic choice to its mannerist and rather boring end. Instead, <i>Melting Sun</i> pulls every trick in Lantlôs’ past into the present, making for charged pop that’s short neither on volume nor surprises nor impact. <i>Melting Sun</i>, like <i>Shelter</i>, is gorgeous. In this case, though, that’s only the start of the compliments, not the end.</p></div>"|19267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19267-lantlos-melting-sun/|8.0|Grayson Haver Currin

But the phrase comes from KRS-One's ""Step Into A World"": ""MCs more worried about their financial backin'/ Steady packin' a gat as if something's gonna happen/ But it doesn't, they wind up shootin' they cousin, they buggin."" It's a joke, but a bleak, mirthless one, with nothing but dread at its core. Maybe Louis CK really <i>could</i> use it.</p>
<p>Questlove has actually called this record satire, adding ""but in that satire, it's an analysis of some of the stereotypes perpetuated in not only the hip-hop community, but in the community."" He has had these things on his mind even more than usual lately; witness his series of thoughtful essays on <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2014/04/questlove-on-how-hip-hop-failed-black-america.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">how hip-hop ""failed Black America</a>"" for Vulture. ""The music originally evolved to paint portraits of real people and handle real problems at close range—social contract, anyone?—but these days, hip-hop mainly rearranges symbolic freight on the black star-liner,"" he wrote.</p>
<p>In many ways, these have been Questlove's concerns since the beginning. The Roots' late-90s high-water mark <i>Things Fall Apart</i> opened with sampled dialogue between Wesley Snipes and Denzel Washington from <i>Mo' Betta Blues</i>. ""It incenses me that own people don't realize our own heritage, our own culture—this is our music!"", says Washington.""The people don't come because you don't play the shit that they like,"" Snipes retorts. In the liner notes, Quest notes the exchange, musing ""But what if you gave people what they need? Hmm.""</p>
<p>This basic assertion—that there is something people need from pop art that they don't know to ask for—underlines the Roots' career. It's a tricky, contentious notion, but they've always managed to tread this want/need line deftly, even as people shouted at each other over the their shoulders. Roots albums, no matter the landscape around them, always feel sturdy, firm—<i>responsible</i>, in the classic Gangstarr way. To paraphrase what Guru once said, they have a formula, but they update that formula. They've been representing the idea of ""Adult Hip Hop"" for a shifting demographic for 20 straight years now, and order to keep yourself at such a dignified arms'-length from the prevailing zeitgeist for that long, you actually have to have a pretty canny grasp on it. </p>
<p>In some ways, the Roots are in middlebrow-culture heaven: They are well-supported by a cushy, high profile, well-paying TV gig, one that loosens them up to do whatever the hell they want. But they are in a weird place right now. Their last album started with a neck-kicking snare and closed with a four-movement wordless jazz suite; it sold about 35k in its first week. Around the same time, the Roots backed Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa, who played their Bruno Mars-assisted single ""Young Wild &amp; Free"", from the execrable 2012 stoner movie <i>Mac and Devin</i>. The soundtrack debuted in the Top 10.</p>
<p> <i>…And Then You Shoot Your Cousin</i>, then, finds the Roots in some version of the comfy purgatory they've been residing since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14386-how-i-got-over/"" target=""_blank""><i>How I Got Over</i></a>. The album itself is ""uncompromising"" in the way all Roots albums have been—the sequencing is fluid and streamlined, and touches of avant-garde jazz and older forms of black pop bleed into the fabric. The mood is dour and bleak, and the rappers who assist Black Thought—Dice Raw, Greg P.O.R.N.—are full-time members of the group by now, as far as listeners are concerned. D.D. Jackson, the pianist who crafted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16102-the-roots-undun/"" target=""_blank""><i>Undun</i></a>'s four-movement suite, returns, and he helps whip the conclusion of ""The Coming"" into a panicked frenzy. The astringent strings swarm the song's edges like locusts clouding a window, and they are the wildest, most anarchic sound here.</p>
<p>""Black Rock"", which samples the same clotted, smoke-clouded rare 45 that Black Milk used on <i>Album of the Year</i>'s ""Deadly Medley"", is one of the hardest-hitting and most baleful songs on the album. The Roots always surprise when they let their edges fray just a bit—Questlove has admitted that he enjoys the moments where he can stop ""icing out"" his technical precision and let his playing go sloppy. It's an infectious feeling you can hear spread through the entire group; ""Black Rock"" is the exact meeting point where Quest's cerebral grit meets Black Thought's all-body-blows rapping. They work beautifully this way, the group's own Lennon/McCartney, in ways that they don't when they stray into more conventional, rock-album formalist ambitions.</p>
<p>Black Thought remains a spectacular rapper, decades into a career with plenty of invitations to burn out. He hasn't slackened an inch. His flow patterns on ""Understand"" hit like flurries of jabs to the sternum. The problem for listeners, of course, remains that he never quite knows how to stop dancing on his toes; he always sounds like he's high-stepping through a tire-field. His writing lands on a vividly sculpted image—""I was born faceless in an oasis, folks disappear here and leave no traces,"" from ""Never"", or ""I'm down to 95 dollars, that's the extent of my riches/ Out of 99 problems, 98 of them is bitches,"" from ""When the People Cheer""—just as often as it tapers off into bars and bars of stock phrases. It keeps Quest's concept-album ambitions on the frustratingly muddy side.</p>
<p>That isn't to say there isn't plenty to think about on <i>Cousin</i>. But most of that thought comes from mood, arrangement, and implication. The opening track, ""Theme From <i>Middle of the Night</i>,"" is just that—Nina Simone, singing the luxuriously wallowing theme song for the 1959 film. Mary Lou Williams' gothic, frightening ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teljKnhw2bs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Devil</a>"" gets sampled for a 40-second snippet that cuts off on the baleful warning ""The Devil looks a lot like you and I."" The song leads directly into ""Black Rock"", the two voices carefully lined up to feel like a direct continuation of each other. There is a squalling burst of musique concrète in ""Dies Arae"", which erupts with Scott Walker fierceness out of the blank space and marauds through the mix for a minute. The album feels haunted, even plagued, by other voices and memories.</p>
<p>And, of course, the records <i>sounds</i> spectacular. Black Thought's voice sounds raspier and more guttural the older he gets. The snares on ""The Dark (Trinity) feel like fingers flicking your ear drums. The Roots have gotten very proficient at making Roots albums. But the hooks on ""Never"", ""When the People Cheer"", and ""The Coming""—sung by Patty Crash, Modesty Lycan, and Mercedes Martinez, respectively—are somewhat flat and generic-sounding. And the songs themselves rely on a Roots template that feels a little too well-worn to generate much friction anymore—midtempo, muted, built around a minor-key piano line and heavy with intimations of doom. It's in those moments, the comfortable, careful ones, that you wonder how closely the Roots examine the symbolic freight aboard their <i>own</i> vessel, how far they would be interested in shaking themselves up.</p></div>"|19332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19332-the-roots-and-then-you-shoot-your-cousin/|7.2|Jayson Greene

Paired with the song’s soaring vocals, tribal drums, and clanging church bells, the whole affair resembles <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zLx_JtcQVI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Circle of Life”</a> performed by a Wilson Phillips-fronted Skid Row—a reminder that, when it comes to indulgence, Kibby just can’t help herself. “I really have a taste for drama,” <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/exclusive-song-premiere-and-interview-white-sea-x-susanne-sundfor/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she told</a> Norwegian singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30750-susanne-sundfr/"">Susanne Sundfør</a>. “Sometimes I have to remind myself to rein it back.”</p>
<p>On <i>In Cold Blood</i>, the theatrics are comparable in ambition to the music that Kibby's had a hand in as part of M83. It’s not as tastefully epic, but Kibby deserves props for fully realizing the vision outlined on her debut EP, 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14943-this-frontier-ep/"">This Frontier</a></i>. She’s turned into a formidable synth sorceress; on ""Warsaw"", Kibby claims she can travel in time and through walls, and that she’ll “seduce your wives” and “fuck you blind”, and she does it with impressive vocal chops, worlds away from the breathy coo she used on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11406-saturdaysyouth/""><i>Saturdays=Youth</i></a>'s “Kim &amp; Jessie” or “Skin of the Night""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11406-saturdaysyouth/""></a>. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55066-white-sea-m83s-morgan-kibby-shares-future-husbands-past-lives-announces-tour/"">“Future Husbands, Past Lives”</a>, she sustains a robust vibrato through her lower midrange all the way through her falsetto, shooting skyward like a balloon set free.</p>
<p>But there’s a fine line between power singing and <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/1523040/the-scourge-of-american-idol-oversingers/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">over-singing</a>, and sometimes Kibby oversteps it with over-the-top embellishments: there's the corny vocalizing on “Warsaw”, the squealing electric guitars in the background of “Ex-Pats”, and a liberal sprinkling of fairy dust over the strings-and-piano ballad “Small December”. Granted, this is music that embraces extremity—“NYC Loves You”'s soaring chorus, thundering drum rolls, and slide guitar, is pure Journey in the best possible way—but Kibby’s dramatic flourishes and musical inspirations are, at best, an acquired taste.</p>
<p>At any rate, <i>In Cold Blood</i>’s '80s-redolent enthusiasm is an improvement on <i>This Frontier</i>’s tepid electro-pop, and its strongest moments— ""Future Husbands"", ""They Don't Know"", and ""NYC Loves You""—find the balance between ""cheesy"" and ""cool"" by reining in the former impulses while staying thematically consistent so the instrumentation complements Kibby's voice rather than matching or overpowering it. Kibby's willingness to push boundaries makes <i>In Cold Blood</i> worth listening to—and, who knows, maybe one day its songs will make for some great karaoke. </p></div>"|19382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19382-white-sea-in-cold-blood/|6.8|Harley Brown

They have worked separately in that time—memorably, in Windy’s case, on the 2008 album <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Windy-Weber-I-Hate-People/release/1343576"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>I Hate People</i></a>, although even that bears an engineering credit for Carl on the sleeve. But here’s <i>Tomorrow</i>, a debut solo work from Windy’s partner, now shedding both the personable first-name-only approach and some familiar musical tropes from years past. It’s a small release, highly limited in vinyl and CD form, complemented by a download with extra tracks that push the runtime to around two hours. There’s nothing small about Hultgren’s intentions here, which, like most of Windy &amp; Carl's work, demonstrates his way of creating sound that simply engulfs, albeit with a greater preference for fragility over his thickened drone sound.</p>
<p>There are no vocals on <i>Tomorrow</i>, and, at times, not much more than guitar lines echoing and repeating—sometimes getting drenched in reverb, sometimes following a cleaner path. A dreamy, druggy feel remains throughout, sometimes recalling other artists who have forged an almost spiritual path into psychedelia. On “No Other”, Hultgren’s in the same celestial sphere as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx6TnpXFlbU&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Come Down Softly to My Soul”</a>, spinning music so delicate it feels entirely lacking in weight. The gossamer touch doesn’t make this any less enveloping; it’s just a different type of absorption to the one Hultgren practices in Windy &amp; Carl. There are touches of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twin</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1807-robin-guthrie/"">Robin Guthrie</a>’s chorus-pedal blues in the earlier parts of <i>Tomorrow</i>, coupled with a similarly drifty feel that dispenses with any earthiness.</p>
<p>For Hultgren, these changes come with a change of scenery—he moved in 2011 and began recording this album just after, with a shift in musical direction mirroring the switch in landscape. There’s further movement internally within <i>Tomorrow</i>, as he deviates into a country inflected lament (“In This Land”), a pile-up of clattering guitar loops (“Hidden”), and an ambient piece that reflects <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>’s work in the field (“Found My Home”). The centerpiece, “Transparency and Light”, mostly draws on the latter discipline, giving up 18 minutes of Hultgren’s soul in the form of a piece so still it’s like time stopped dead in its tracks around it. His best music often has that effect, becoming akin to the way a moth gets transfixed by a light, causing the world to just fall out of view for a while.</p>
<p>The additional, digital-only tracks on <i>Tomorrow</i> continue its theme, although it’s notable how the instrumental take on the Windy &amp; Carl song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16617-i-walked-alone/"">“I Walked Alone”</a> doesn’t quite fit here. Most interesting is “Found My Home”, presented in both six-minute and nineteen-minute versions, a choice that offers insight into Hultgren’s thoughtful editing approach. Something notable about both the main body of <i>Tomorrow</i> and its additional material is the way he constantly fills the air with something, even if it's just a quiet din clanging away in the background. There’s always a light bed of noise shimmering in the distance behind more prominent guitar lines, or times when that foundation becomes the predominant force in a song (“Invisible”). It’s quiet music that’s strangely deafening in its way, never letting up in its constant tide of sound.</p></div>"|19355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19355-carl-hultgren-tomorrow/|7.0|Nick Neyland

Ever since their career-launching debut, 1997's <i>Not for Threes</i>, Andy Turner and Ed Handley have released carefully composed recordings full of warm tones, friendly melodies, and interesting technical sleights of hand; they've often found themselves situated between the genre's mercurial virtuosos (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3921-squarepusher/"">Squarepusher</a>) and a legion of hacky glitch engineers. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Their latest, <i>Reachy Prints</i>, is full of new sounds. Handley and Turner are dedicated tech geeks who embody the genre’s commitment to exploring off-label uses of different gear in order to see if it makes any interesting noises. “Nafovanny” possesses an intriguingly detuned lead, while “Tether” generates an edgy atmosphere from a fascinatingly ugly, dissonant synth patch. The arrangements are familiar, though, and the album fits in comfortably with the rest of Plaid's discography, defined by a relaxed-but-peppy energy and well-mannered songs that evolve smoothly with as few shocks as possible. (The exceptions to this rule appeared on 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15860-scintilli/"">Scintilli</a>,</i> which featured some uncharacteristically aggressive and bumpy tracks and was all the more intriguing for it.)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>IDM has always been devoted to challenging approaches to experimentation, so consistency isn’t necessarily a virtue in the genre; while Plaid's latest batch of material should satisfy those who have kept track of the duo's output thus far, it doesn’t push many boundaries. Interestingly, though, the type of electronic music that Plaid makes—melodic enough to be accessible while retaining glitchy qualities—has, over the last twenty years, moved from the very fringes of the pop landscape to a little closer to pop's center. Specifically, Aphex Twin's become a touchstone of sorts for rap producers, and his influence has trickled up to the point where it’s not unusual for chart-placing songs to feature the stuttering rhythms, tweaked-out synthesizers, simulated vinyl brakes, and other various controlled malfunctions that Aphex and, by extension IDM’s known for.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So as the pop world has tilted in a way that’s moved Handley and Turner’s music in a closer vicinity to the mainstream, which suits them better. The qualities that previously constrained their music—specifically, their melodic affability, especially compared to the compellingly malicious vibe their contemporaries give off—now work in their favor, but that also means that as an experimental electronic album, <i>Reachy Prints</i> comes off as milquetoast. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As a pop album, though, it sparkles: the oscillating beat, flickering melodies, and cooly dark atmosphere of opening track “OH” could have fit in nicely on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18778-saint-heron""><i>Saint Heron</i></a>, last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"">Solange</a>-curated compilation of alternative R&amp;B. <span>The pair have worked with vocalists regularly in the past, and “Lilith,” their collaboration with Bjork on <i>Not For Threes</i>, is not only one of the best songs of their early career but one of hers too.</span> If Turner and Handley embraced their poppier tendencies, they could conceivably reach a new level of success—stranger things have happened.</span></p></div>"|19363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19363-plaid-reachy-prints/|6.0|Miles Raymer

""I'd love to do Wembley Stadium, but where do you go after that?"" At the time, the guitarist and songwriter was talking to a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20040912001616/http://www.peom.co.uk/oasis_interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fanzine</a> and getting ready to play the lame, 400-capacity East Wing venue in Brighton, England. So not only was Noel looking forward to playing the UK's most storied venue—which was more than 200 times bigger than the East Wing—he was basically already <i>over</i> the fantasy. ""I didn’t think we’d get to this stage here for another two years, and in a way it’s fuckin' pissed me off,"" he continued, talking about the tumbling hype that had followed their first single, ""Supersonic"", which debuted on the UK charts at #31 earlier that year. ""We were going to be this maverick outcast band from Manchester…we were going to shove it up them for two years and then we’d split up."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">Oasis did eventually sell-out Wembley three times over at the end of 1997, but by then they were already mired in bloated obsolescence—and they did split up, but only after about 15 years of spinning their wheels. Noel knew his grandest rock'n'roll dreams could lead to trouble, even when they were still merely outsized ambitions in '94. All of those dreams—the platinum plaques, the American crossover, the record-breaking festivals—came true in spectacular fashion over the course of the next three years, and then Oasis really did have no idea where to go. They were terrible at being The Biggest Band in the World, but as this 20th anniversary reissue of their first album makes sparklingly clear, they were amazing at <i>wanting</i> to be The Biggest Band in the World. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Definitely Maybe </i>was made by five losers from the dreary Manchester suburb of Burnage, a locale Noel has described as ""a little shitty town where fuck-all happens—it’s one pub and a chippie and a bookie and that’s it."" They were second-generation Irish working-class roustabouts who used their government assistance money to buy smokes, drugs, and pints on the weekend before heading back to their dead-end jobs. As Alex Niven writes in his well-rounded new <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Oasis-Definitely-Maybe-Alex-Niven/dp/1623564239"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">33 ⅓ book on <i>Definitely Maybe</i></span></a>, the boys in Oasis were emblematic of the socio-economic demoralization brought on by England's every-man-for-himself Conservative policies of the 1980s and early '90s. As Noel once <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/8688-noel-gallagher/"">said</a>, ""Where I come from, people didn't become rock stars. That happened to other people.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">But Oasis were also a signpost of hope for an emerging new version of England that was finally mobilizing after being beaten down by the Thatcher years. Against this backdrop, the Gallagher brothers and company emerged: All the anger and nihilism of a go-nowhere existence channeled through Noel's blaring guitar tones and brash, drugged-up lyrics, along with Liam's attack-dog snarl. <i>Definitely Maybe</i> is the sound of people who feel like they need to scream to be heard—and even then, the chances of anyone actually <i>listening</i> seems depressingly unlikely. </p>
<p class=""p2"">And yet, not wholly impossible. The album's first lines are: ""Live my life in the city, there's no easy way out."" Pretty bleak. But that song is called ""Rock 'N' Roll Star"", and it's about the possibility of escape via substances, or standing on a stage in front of a dozen people (as Oasis did many times in the early years), or your own head. ""In my mind my dreams are real,"" sings Liam, and who can argue with that? Dreams play a big role on <i>Definitely Maybe</i> and its accompanying B-sides—all of which are collected in this three-disc re-release, along with many live performances and demos from the period—though they often read as both wistful and demanding, owing to the one-in-a-billion ying-yang chemistry between Noel's words and Liam's delivery. On paper, Noel's lyrics often read as bittersweet; then 27, he was beginning to look at his youth as a lost era. But placed in 22-year-old Liam's mouth, ""Rock 'N' Roll Star"" transforms from a flight of fancy into something like an inevitability. Yes: This man sounds like Lennon and Lydon's sneering son. Yes: He will stop at nothing until these wanting words become physical fact. Yes: Here is your rock 'n' roll star, because there isn't anything else for him to be. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The contentiousness between the brothers fueled Oasis' best moments, and, early on at least, both seemed to understand the situation—even if they couldn't stand each other. Referring to Noel in an interview from '94, Liam said, in no uncertain terms: ""That's why we'll be the best band in the world—because I fuckin' hate that twat there."" Like vintage Oasis itself, Liam embodied just enough classic rock, just enough punk, and just enough ""I'll spit in your fucking eye"" to make his unfiltered id stick. Usually, this type of rock persona is associated with more combustible or aggressive music, but Noel tempered the abrasiveness with a trace of melancholy or a fuzzed-up bubblegum melody, as on career highs like ""Live Forever"" and ""Slide Away"". Then, now, and forever, Liam is the <i>Definitely</i> and Noel is the <i>Maybe</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I couldn't express any of this when I first saw Liam's strobed face on MTV in the ""Live Forever"" video as a 13-year-old middle-class kid from Long Island, but I got my mom to drive me to Nobody Beats the Wiz to buy the CD all the same. At that time, I thought Axl Rose was an insane genius and Kurt Cobain—who died six days after the release of ""Supersonic""—was an inscrutable weirdo. And in America, Oasis were practically an underground band; they were amazingly cool, and I felt cooler for liking them. They were blatantly inspired by all of the canonical rock bands I knew, but they possessed the feeling of <i>now</i>. Their version of infinity guitars and attitude made me feel invincible, the same sensation I got a few years later while getting into hip-hop—another working-class-bred artform known to utilize the past, via sampling and respun rhymes, to accentuate the present. (""Never be afraid of the obvious,"" Noel once said, ""because it's all been done before."") Oasis started from the very bottom and, from that very first note, it was obvious where they were going next.</p>
<p class=""p3"">But just as Oasis' undesirable upbringing incited them to lash out through feedback and distortion, you could argue that it stunted their continued artistic existence. Middle-class art-schooler Damon Albarn may have lost the popular vote during Blur's notorious mid-90s battle with Oasis, but with partial thanks to a relatively comfortable adolescence and education, he's clearly won the war, remaining relevant and inquisitive to this day. Oasis' woeful decline, meanwhile, makes a specific line from ""Shakermaker"" sound a bit heartbreaking in hindsight: ""I'd like to be somebody else and not know where I've been."" Eventually, the Gallaghers turned into the same rich dicks they were trying to usurp on <i>Definitely Maybe</i>—a sad vengeance. But on the way up, they marked millions. Maybe that should be enough.</p></div>"|19258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19258-oasis-definitely-maybe-reissue/|8.8|Ryan Dombal

It’s not the fact that he’s been in the game longer than just about anybody: he practically wrote the rulebook, DJing and producing over three sprawling decades of mutations that Chicago house’s DNA underwent, gradually percolating into juke and abstracting into footwork and blurring the lines between all of the above. There’s a cheeky-yet-deadly earnest wink to much of his work, the kind that sits parallel to irony but couldn’t be further from it; in a sphere that rewards overt humor—see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"">DJ Rashad</a> and Freshmoon’s doofily hysterical <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGlMaZ3WEN4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Everybody”</a>, built around a meme from the TV show ""Intervention"", or snarky DJ Slugo numbers like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMtbBz2YUwA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Wouldn’t You Like To Be A Hoe Too”</a>—Traxman’s sense of humor has persistently tended towards kitsch. He’s not into the long sell, since people are supposed to stay dancing while listening to this stuff, remember?</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16530-the-mind-of-traxman/"">first volume</a> of <i>Da Mind Of Traxman</i>, his 2012 Planet Mu debut and arguably the first great solo footwork full-length, reveled in these kinds of tenderly shlocky moves, forgoing esotericism for pointedly ham-fisted and ultimately democratic gestures—ideologically, the precocious lovechild of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">Dilla</a>’s samplemania and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"">2 Chainz</a>’ knee-slappy dad punchlines. For the owner of one of Chicago’s most renowned record collections, encyclopedic and meticulously organized, Traxman’s never been one for going over his audience’s heads, even when shit gets weird. That would be inefficient, and besides, he can do weird all by himself; that album’s most surreal moment, “Let There Be Rockkkkk”, was built from a cock-in-hand AC/DC sample.</p>
<p><i>Da Mind Of Traxman Vol. 2</i> is trimmer and more muscular, even as it maintains his signature playfulness. Where its predecessor threw the whole fridge in the blender and delighted in making his friends drink it, here Traxman seems interested in doing more with less, probing the limits of each individual component, experimenting with song structure. Samples misbehave and are duly punished, though there’s an obvious tenderness with which they’re handled even as he brutalizes them. Sticky, honey-coated bursts of Rhodes and horns and xylophones over-eagerly trip on each other, threaten to fall out of sync, then jump back in line on opening track “Time Slip”. “Let It Roll Geto” is an ungodly mash of chopped “Sunglasses At Night”-y synth arpeggios and ghostly, gargled mermaid-soul, all of which gets shoved around by stuttering ghetto-house vocal tics, exponentially accelerating into barked orders like a long-lost Tae-Bo video where Billy Blanks tries PCP.</p>
<p>Footwork cuts typically end up either ""garish"" or ""great"", with very little room in between those two poles—and there’s certainly a bit of the former here too. “Bubbles” aims for restraint but grows mind-numbingly repetitive, and not in the transcendent, mantra-like sense of footwork and juke at its most effective (like, say, “15416”, hypnotizing in its deceptive simplicity). “Tha Edge Of Panic” starts off intriguingly enough, a gracefully gut-wrenching sequel of sorts to “Let There Be Rockkkkk”, but unravels into brutal hysteria, a nightmare of roid-rage grindcore. That’s the tax for taking these kinds of try-anything-once risks, one that’s fairly inevitable in an 18-track album of any sort, but especially with footwork. By their nature, footwork tracks tend to exist in and of themselves, specific tools in a set moreso than cogs in a unified machine; in heavy doses, they can overwhelm a casual listening session (namely, while multi-tasking and sober).</p>
<p>All the same, continuing to classify footwork as a primarily functional art form in 2014 presents something of a paradox. At its core, the claim rings true, and always will—above all else, this is music for dancers who want to be challenged and DJs eager to oblige—but it can also be limiting, particularly taking into account the past four or so years of full-length releases that have aimed not to alter the genre, but to let it transcend its intended context for a bit. It begs the question: what exactly does a great footwork album—a whole greater than the sum of its parts—entail, if it’s even possible?<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18627-dj-rashad-double-cup/""><i> Double Cup</i></a>, the late DJ Rashad’s 2013 magnum opus, is proof enough that it is; at the very least, it’s the closest a footwork full-length has gotten to perfection. <i>Da Mind Of Traxman Vol. 2</i>, for the most part, is a stellar collection of songs—playful, ballsy, informed by the past but living very much in the present—but they’re songs that relate more as cousins than as siblings.</p></div>"|19346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19346-traxman-da-mind-of-traxman-vol-2/|7.5|Meaghan Garvey

He ended up with the best work of his young career, a satisfying leap from the bushy-tailed, eager-to-please kid brother raps of his early work towards tighter rhymes fixated in a knottier headspace.</p>
<p>Mac has since worked tirelessly to prove <i>Watching Movies</i>’ gains were no fluke, showcasing his range on a series of off-the-cuff side projects: <i>Delusional Thomas</i> featured an impishly pitched-up Mac cutting loose on a half-hour mixtape of gutbucket murder raps, while <i>Live from Space</i> documented the plush sonics of Miller’s summer 2013 Space Migration Tour, which fleshed out <i>Watching Movies</i>’ spacier cuts with the help of Syd tha Kid and Matt Martians’ project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29960-the-internet/"">the Internet</a>. Odd Future associate Vince Staples’ <i>Stolen Youth</i> featured Mac in the producer’s chair unfurling hypnotic soundscapes under his Larry Fisherman pseudonym.</p>
<p>Mac Miller’s most ambitious post-<i>Watching Movies</i> project arrived in the form of a Mother’s Day mixtape called <i>Faces</i>, which advances on his last LP's heady sprawl with a palette stretching from rainy day introspection to playful wordplay exercises. Where <i>Watching Movies</i> was equally concerned with refining his writing skills and presenting a personality you wouldn’t mind sparking up a j with, this mixtape prizes frankness over curation. On cuts like opener “Inside Outside” and “Here We Go”, the latter in which Mac pridefully scans his growing empire and notes that he “did it all without a Drake feature”, the joy is infectious.</p>
<p>Mac gets downcast for the midsection body shot combo of “Happy Birthday”, “Wedding”, and “Funeral”, a passage that moves seamlessly from excitement to fear and uncertainty (“Do you ever reach to touch her, but there’s nothing there?/ Do you tell her that you love her, but she doesn’t care?”) into despair (“Doing drugs is just a war with boredom, but they’re sure to get me”). <i>Faces</i> goes where <i>Watching Movies</i> wouldn’t, picking over the fallout from a teen rap sensation suddenly becoming <i>nouveau riche</i>.</p>
<p>Much of the time, that means picking apart Mac’s infatuation with drugs. Hard partying bleeds into unexpected corners of the proceedings, from the debit card covered in “snowflakes” on “Friends” to the cautionary PCP comedown tale of “Angel Dust”. Miller catalogues reckless substance use like a news anchor would a traffic jam: he matter-of-factly calls himself a “drug absorbent endorphin addict” with a “drug habit like Philip Hoffman” on “What Do You Do?”, and even “Therapy”’s lightweight account of a night out with a girl contains a bout of self-medication. “Malibu” warns that “The good times can be a trap” and toys with the idea of checking into rehab before resolving to just save the remainder of the coke for another day. There's a troubling sense that Mac is tiptoeing down a well-lit path toward self-destruction and that he either feels too helpless or else too enrapt to change course , but if <i>Faces</i>’ good-times-are-killing-me terrors seem overbearing, they’re often offset by a sense that music is his salvation.</p>
<p>On the technical end, <i>Faces</i> is Mac Miller’s high watermark. The wordplay is limber and odd, as flows shift mid-verse and imbue otherwise nonsensical turns of phrase with jerky life. It’s enough to make unrepentantly dark lines lively. When “Polo Jeans” opens with “I give no fucks when I go nuts cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, dead/ Woke up from the coma, pulled up in a Škoda, smoked, went back to bed” you’re more likely to run it back for the deft internal rhymes than the plot point about a potential overdose.</p>
<p>Miller’s finally able to play ball with his esteemed rap friends, too; where he once played outfield for guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"">Earl Sweatshirt</a> and Staples, here he’s matching them bar for bar. By the time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross"">Rick Ross</a> shows up for verse three of “Insomniak”, Mac’s already run the beat ragged. Miller’s advances as a self-taught auteur also extend to production: he crafted the majority of the beats here, and he’s arrived at an unfussed, sample-based melodicism that both harkens back to the jazzy boom bap of the 75 Ark and Fondle ‘Em Records era and stays the hell out of the way of the raps.</p>
<p><i>Faces</i> finds Mac Miller embracing a typical 2010s rapper trope: the exploratory between-album mixtape. Its 24 tracks run nearly an hour and a half, each restlessly tinkering with his songwriting and production talents. The sprawl gives<i> </i><i>Faces</i> a directionless feel, so it’s doubtful you’ll ever play it all in one sitting—regardless, the kid’s turning out the best work of his career, transforming adversity and discouragement into intriguing art. It might seem daunting, drug-crazed and unwieldy at the outset, but given the proper time and patience, the mixtape proves to be Mac’s most consistently honest and personal work to date. Early on “Here We Go” advises that he “ain’t little Malcolm with the baby face” anymore, and whatever memory of that goofy, affable kid remains, <i>Faces</i> is its slow and methodical death and dismemberment.</p></div>"|19390.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19390-mac-miller-faces/|7.3|Craig Jenkins

Discogs lists nine studio albums credited to Katsoulis, which span from 1986’s <i>Minimal Suite</i> to his most recent, 2011’s <i>Pictures from Inside</i>.</p>
<p>But the first time most 21st century listeners might have heard Katsoulis was on the fascinating compilation <i>Into The Light: A Journey Into Greek Electronic Music, Classics &amp; Rarities</i>, which was released less than two years ago and now fetches ludicrous sums online. That comp introduced Greece’s fertile, if unheralded music, scene and heretofore-unknown artists like George Theodorakis and Costas Charitodiplomenos, all of whom blur the lines between ambient, avant garde electronic composition, and New Age drifts in a heady manner. While Vangelis’ contribution didn’t quite break the two-minute mark, it showed an intriguing voice at work.</p>
<p>All three aforementioned genres appear in Katsoulis' oeuvre, and this handy introduction to his work shows this composer’s wide range. The track included on that comp, ""Improvisation"" opens side two of this album; it's a dizzying mix of crisp percussion, pillowy synth chords, and finely minced “choir” presets that could easily be mistaken for something off of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18537-oneohtrix-point-never-r-plus-seven/"">R Plus Seven</a></i>. The track suggests that what might have scanned as New Age softness back in the '80s now offers up a glimpse into the 21st-century avant-garde.</p>
<p>The eleven tracks compiled here are ephemeral and lovely, if not always memorable. Four of them first appeared on his 1987 album <i>The Slipping Beauty</i> (the title a play on Tchaikovsky’s “The Sleeping Beauty”) and the title track reveals the kind of shimmering poly-rhythmic tones that bring to mind the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a>. Yet, on “Earth Beat”, heavy drums mix with featherweight keys and a foreboding synth note that sounds like the ominous opening bit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a>’s “Beat It.” There’s flute trills on “The Eternal Return”, mixed into a bass glissade, screwed-down vocal growls and hand drums that give the track a strange feel of being both airy and dark. The electric bass on “Longing” sounds like Katsoulis is doing his best overly-busy-solo-Sting impression, but the violin melody remains evocative.</p>
<p>In the composer’s notes, Katsoulis writes that his work is closely related to the processes of time, and one particular aspect fascinates him most of all: “Beauty, which being subject to decay, has such a fleeting nature.” The most intriguing moments on <i>The Sleeping Beauties</i> are those that both comment on time and also take their time revealing their quirks and charms. The nearly ten-minute “Enigma” is an odd mix of what might otherwise scan as interstitial music on an afternoon talk show, now dilated into long form modern composition.</p>
<p>The two pieces that close the set also hover in that expanded space. The previously unreleased “Imago”, from 2012, builds from a rippling keyboard line that is a sonic speedball, at once mimicking the brightness of steel drums and the pensive moments of an '80s cop show. Soprano saxophone, violin, guitars, keyboard and percussion comprise “Epilogue”, each element cycling as new timbres are introduced. It’s an evocative piece, one that showcases the type of minimalism that informs not just <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> pieces but also waiting room music, each in its own manner soundtracking the passage of time.</p></div>"|19345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19345-vangelis-katsoulis-the-sleeping-beauties-a-collection-of-early-and-unreleased-works/|7.3|Andy Beta

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Moments like that abound on </span><i>Keine Oase in Sicht </i><span>(German for “No Oasis in Sight”), Datashock's best effort to date. There are times when it feels like they’re toying with their own powers, meditating so long you start to think they’ll never uncover an epiphany—and, inevitably, a climax arrives to justify the group’s long mountain climb. The album opens with the longest climb, the 14-minute “Mudschahidin der Liebe”, whose oscillating organ tones and rave-up crescendo resemble a stretched-out </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/""><span>Spiritualized</span></a><span>. “Rubinregen aus der spirituellen Sphäre” waltzes stonedly to a peak in the vein of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/293-bardo-pond/""><span>Bardo Pond</span></a><span> or </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28298-eternal-tapestry/""><span>Eternal Tapestry</span></a><span>, and “Her mit dem Kelch, (das) hier muss es sein” is practically funk—</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/722-james-chance/""><span>James Chance</span></a><span> reimagined as a hippie. Even something as gaseous as “Desert Lustgerte, Goldnougat Gobi” ends in a miniature flash of rolling beat that retroactively reveals direction in the sounds that led to it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Compared to other groups who deal in this kind of slow-burning ascension, Datashock are rarely noisy or cacophonous. Instrumental music that’s largely improvised has the tendency to become clutttered, but Datashock express profundity within a clean, spacious sound.

The conversation turned to dubstep, the roots of which were just starting to take hold in London; Martin heard a track of Goodman’s, who was just then cutting his teeth as a producer, and he encouraged him to start a label to release it, promising to help find a distributor. Less than a year later came HYP001, “Sign of the Dub” b/w “Stalker”, a collaborative release between Kode9 and UK rapper Spaceape (then credited as Daddy Gee).</p>
<p>For Hyperdub’s first four years, the label moved carefully when it came to releases. Most of their output from 2004–2006 was credited to Goodman and Spaceape, including the duo’s debut LP <i>Memories of the Future</i>, but they also worked with some guy named William Bevan, whose self-titled debut LP as Burial came in 2006, a year after Goodman put out the project’s wobbly first 12“, <i>South London Boroughs</i>. <i>Burial</i> was a modest record that initially attracted curiosity more than it did accolades, but in 2007 Bevan returned with the excellent <i>Ghost Hardware</i> 12” and the instant classic <i>Untrue</i>, a record that came to define dubstep for legions of new listeners seven years before <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/77415?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dubstep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Merriam Webster decided to define it themselves</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most influential electronic records  in recent memory, <i>Untrue</i> cemented Bevan as one of the decade’s most vital producers and introduced dubstep (more as a concept, less as a sound) to a much wider audience. So you can imagine what its success did for Hyperdub. A brief glance at the label’s chronological catalog resembles a dam about to burst, and <i>Untrue</i> was the low frequency that shook the firmament to the point of collapse. In 2008 came releases from up-and-coming names that, six years later, are familiar to anyone in the know: bass music basket case Zomby, abstracted pop outfit Darkstar (who at that point were working with a more explicitly dance-focused sound), dubstep-gone-freestyle queen Ikonika. Martin’s lover’s rock-focused King Midas Sound project even put out their first release for the label that year.</p>
<p>Hyperdub marked their fifth anniversary in 2009, but despite a half-decade of existence, the label’s creative surge had kicked into high gear only two years previous. So the excellent <i>5 Years of Hyperdub </i>was as much an overview of where Hyperdub had been as it was a chance to draw on the increased exposure electronic music was receiving and define something approaching a “scene.” Ace cuts from Los Angeles hip-hop auteur Flying Lotus, Dutch dance producer Martyn, and dub-as-fuck mad scientist Mala appeared alongside catalog highlights from label regulars Kode9, LV, and yes, Burial.</p>
<p><i>5 Years of Hyperdub</i> was the culmination of a series of five 12"" releases collecting label highlights—<i>5.1</i>, <i>5.2</i>, you get the idea—and the expanded approach Hyperdub’s taken to that concept for their 10-year anniversary is indicative of how quickly Goodman’s label has grown, both in size and influence. <i>10.1</i> is a two-CD set—the first in the series, no less—with one disc collecting tracks from the label’s last five years and one with entirely new material. Each compilation will have a theme, and <i>10.1</i> turns its focus towards dancefloor-centered cuts, so those waiting for a collection of Hyperdub’s stranger entries might have to wait a little longer.</p>
<p>That said, <i>10.1</i> is more proof that Hyperdub can’t help but embrace left-of-center even as it focuses on club fare. This is far from a bad thing: Hyperdub’s released some of the most appealingly odd and oddly prescient electronic music of the last 15 years, and the glaring omissions from this volume’s disc of catalog cuts—Terror Danjah’s fiery grime tune “Acid” from 2010, Ossie’s bubbly UK Funky cut “Set the Tone” from 2011, the jagged piano-house of Laurel Halo’s “Throw”, from last year's <i>Behind the Green Door</i> EP—only serve to highlight the wealth of material the label <i>has</i> released.</p>
<p>Dance music label comps serve a dual purpose: 1) provide an accessible way for non-collectors to obtain material that might’ve received limited release; 2) offer labels a way to define their legacy or current position in the music landscape. <i>10.1</i> fulfills the first function simply by existing, and effectively flips two middle fingers towards the second. One of the most intriguing elements of Hyperdub’s output is its sheer unpredictability and refusal of easy categorization. The closest thing to dubstep proper on the first disc is Burial and Spaceape’s <i>Burial</i> cut “Spaceape”, an obvious nod to Hyperdub’s humble beginnings; from there, we’re hit with variations on the breezy skip of Funky (Funkystepz’s “Hurricane Riddim”, Ill Blu’s “Clapper”), 8-bit fantasias (Ikonika’s “Idiot”, Walton’s “Aggy”), low-slung hip-hop (Mark Pritchard and Om’mas Keith’s “Wind It Up”), and effervescent grime (Kode9’s “Xingfu Lu”).</p>
<p>In addition to shining a light on the difficulty of categorizing Hyperdub, the old-stuff collection is further proof that the label’s vision is always trained forward. Appearances from regulars Ikonika and Cooly G are a reminder that, along with Laurel Halo and Canadian techno-pop architect Jessy Lanza, Hyperdub’s been one of the few of-the-moment dance labels to consistently showcase female artists. Stylistically, they’ve also found themselves ahead of the curve: Morgan Zarate’s as-of-yet-underappreciated “Hookid”, from 2011, is a tangled sigh of staircase tones, phased-out bass hits, and cascading synths ripped from Southern U.S. hip-hop. At the time, it was a curiosity; in 2014, it sounds like a trap precedent, if that sound’s basic elements were scrambled in a blender and poured all over some poor sap’s kitchen counter.</p>
<p>The new-stuff disc offers few hints as to where the label is headed next, which is unsurprising, but the variety on display is only matched by the quality of the tunes themselves. Detroit techno fiend Kyle Hall’s “Girl U So Strong” builds and breaks with wheezing tones and backbeats, a throaty diva shout occasionally popping up to offer an anchor; Zarate returns with the hard-hitting “Kaytsu”, a track even more explicitly trap than the genre-predicting “Hookid”, while the relatively quiet producer Kuedo (whose 2011 LP <i>Severant</i> still stands as an overlooked gem) returns with a track dubbed after his namesake and sporting his signature Vangelis-meets-Big Tymers style of aural hypnotism. Following the explicit reggae of his Essential Mix from last year, Mala delivers one of his meanest anthems to date with the stomping “Expected”, while Japanese producer and Hyperdub mainstay Quarta330 closes out the disc with the hyper-colorful “Hanabi”.</p>
<p>The “what’s to come” section takes up the back half of <i>10.1</i>’s fresh-jams collection, in the form of a stretch of footwork primarily from the Teklife crew. Footwork continues to gain a greater presence in the electronic world, aided by fellow UK label Planet Mu’s scene-surveying <i>Bangs &amp; Works</i> compilations and cemented by last year’s classic LP from the late DJ Rashad, <i>Double Cup</i>. Earlier this year, Goodman told <a href=""http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2014/01/28/music/ten-years-on-hyperdub-finds-that-it-pays-to-be-weird/#.U3tl7y9Vr_Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Japan Times</i></a> that he was drawn to getting involved with the genre by way of Planet Mu founder Mike Paradinas: “Mike said to me, ‘Go on, release this stuff, because everyone thinks I’m crazy.’”</p>
<p>Paradinas had a point—footwork in its rawest form can be grating, and the stretch of brown-sound bass hits and repetitive vocal samples that mark the back half of the first disc of <i>10.1</i> may lead to a few headaches. But Hyperdub’s embrace of the genre was perfectly timed, and the cuts presented here showcase a scene that is further mutating and innovating as it gains more widespread attention. Taso &amp; Djunya’s “Only the Strong Survive” pairs footwork’s intense focus with a starry-eyed sense of wonder, DJ Spinn“’s ”All My Teklife“ features synths that glisten so bright they threaten to overpower everything else around them, and DJ Earl’s ”I’m Gonna Get You"" hammers its titular phrase home to the point of aggravation until the sample drops out with a sense of relief before revving up all over again.</p>
<p>Rashad appears posthumously on both discs of <i>10.1</i>: along with DJ Taye, he had a hand in DJ Earl’s other cut on the new disc, the typically intense “Bombaklot”, and Rashad and Gant-Man further explore <i>Double Cup</i>’s acid techno flirtations on the enjoyable “Acid Life”. He also closes out the disc of catalog highlights—the comp was announced well before Rashad’s sudden and tragic death last month, so this is an unusual occurrence of timing above all else—with the epochal “Let It Go”. A titanic track that could be considered footwork’s own <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiCEGXGm-z0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Strings of Life”</a>, “Let It Go” has a classic, immovable sound, as a lone drum machine kicks things off before meeting up with the endlessly, blissfully repeated vocal sample. Some warped strings enter, and for a second it seems like things are off—“Something doesn’t sound right” is, granted, an understandable reaction to most footwork—but then the vocal sample completes itself with a diva’s cry, “Baaa-by/ Bayyyyyy-beeeeee”, that hits like a gut-punch.</p>
<p>“Let It Go” was released on March 18, 2013, as part of Rashad’s excellent <i>Rollin’</i> EP for Hyperdub; a year, one month, and eight days later, he was found dead at his home in Chicago’s West Side. Before his death, I must have personally listened to “Let It Go” at least eight or nine times a week, and every time I put it on, it took me places that only the most impressionistically beautiful pieces of music can go. I’ve listened to it while feeling sad, happy, unsure, frustrated, in love, out of place—basically, it’s music I put on when I want to feel <i>something</i>. After Rashad’s death, the urge to latch onto the track’s more melancholy aspects is there, but every time I reach for “Let It Go”, the flood of emotions remains rich and complex. Rashad touched a lot of people with his visionary, melodic approach to footwork, and the dance community has only begun feeling the effects of his legacy; amidst the incredible collection of tunes on <i>10.1</i>, “Let It Go” is proof that, even in the ever-changing world of electronic music, it’s possible to create something that sounds absolutely timeless.</p></div>"|19356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19356-hyperdub-101/|8.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

But really...<i>honestly?</i> We are, after all, talking about a genre assumed to be in constant contact with the feelings of teendom—but the next line gives more context: “They seem too/ See-through/ To be true.” Rather than someone cutting themselves off from or invalidating their own teenage feelings, Kinsella’s just outside that time frame trying to figure out how the emotions and music that moved him during his formative years figure into his current life. That’s why, as self-identifying emo bands are making music that’s more mature, refined, and exploratory than anything that came before it, <i>American Football </i>is currently the most influential album in the genre.</p>
<p>This deluxe reissue of <i>American Football</i> benefits from unusually good timing—and unlike most solemnly revered anniversary sets, this isn’t a mobilization of fan dollars after countless inclusions in Best Of Decade lists, and it's not a case of “You had to be there” nostalgia, either. The raw 4-track demos, generous liner notes (written by guitarist Steve Holmes), and candid photographs are meant to welcome the people who weren’t “there” back in 1999, a grouping that includes pretty much <i>everybody</i> at this point. Still, the album's reach in 2014 is estimable: American Football recently sold out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54851-american-football-reunite-for-first-shows-in-15-years/"">an entire weekend at Webster Hall in New York</a> in the matter of minutes—each night they'll play to a crowd ten times bigger than any they saw during their entire existence.</p>
<p>Personally, it took me damn near a decade to find and appreciate <i>American Football</i>, and looking back, it's easy to understand why it didn’t have made an instantaneous or seismic impact upon its release. After the implosion of Cap’n Jazz, Mike’s brother Tim was the more public, combative and divisive party; meanwhile, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3406-the-promise-ring"">the Promise Ring</a> had just released <i>Very Emergency </i> months prior, one of emo's preliminary pushes towards the center. Consequently, American Football came together quickly, stirred up a decent amount of anticipation from a formative EP (its exclusion is the only disappointment the reissue provides), and disbanded almost immediately after the release of the LP.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Of course, hardcore fans claim plenty of one-off collectors’ items as landmarks, and in retrospect, American Football’s existence as something of a cul de sac rather than a connection to Kinsella’s later work as Owen or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3190-owls"">Owls </a>further serves to show what a unique record it is. American Football’s greatest innovation was successfully removing any trace of punk rock while still functioning within the genre. This was a bold maneuver, since the genre's hardcore roots were about the only thing that gave its practicioners even the slightest bit of credibility. American Football weren’t the only ones headed in new directions (see: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/118-the-appleseed-cast"">the Appleseed Cast</a>), but whatever you think “punk rock” means, they got rid of it on <i>American Football</i>—there’s no confrontation, almost no distortion, no power chords, and none of the verse/chorus structure that was maintained even when emo became virtually synonymous with alt-rock.</p>
<p>In actuality, <i>American Football </i>is one of the more subtle post-rock records of its time—a variation on what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake"">the Sea and Cake</a> and Gastr Del Sol were doing a few hours north in Chicago, but crucially operating from the heart rather than the brain. Only “Honestly?” bears some remnant of proper “rock” music, its main riff a twang-free rendering of “Rebel Rebel”. The cascading coda of “Stay Home” alludes to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11841-just-for-a-day-souvlaki-pygmalion"">Slowdive's <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><i>Pygmalion</i></span></a>, while “The Summer Ends” recasts the pastoral free-form, flowing hymnals of late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"">Talk Talk</a> as a swooning mash note.</p>
<p>In the reissue's liner notes, Holmes makes numerous mentions of the band emulating <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis"">Miles Davis</a>—typical namedrops for people in their early 20s who want to make it clear how <i>seriously</i> they’re taking music these days. There is trumpet on the record, courtesy of drummer Steve Lamos, and no one will mistake its sounds for anything the Prince of Darkness ever conjured. But Lamos’ amateur ingenuity perfectly suits the album's informality. The jarring blue note that introduces “The Summer Ends” sounds like a mistake at first, but by playing it twice the wrong note becomes the right note; it's a Choose Your Own Adventure Breakup Song that leaves its conclusion open-ended, even if you just <i>know</i> something<i>’s</i> forever lost. Likewise, over the glimmering motifs of “For Sure”, Lamos' sighing, brassy wail lets you know that when Kinsella whispers “Imagine us together”, the whole thing will end in tears.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Minimalism, repetition, and subtle virtuosity were rare elements amidst Cap’n Jazz’s spazzed-out arpeggios, the Vagrant label's lockstep pop, and the severe start-and-stop musicianship of Jade Tree and Deep Elm bands. So what, exactly, makes <i>American Football</i> emo? Upon announcing their reunion, the band explained their return by joking, “Obviously, we knew the time was ripe for three middle aged dudes to play some old songs about teenage feelings, and stand around tuning guitars for a long time."" It’s actually the latter part of that statement that points to <i>American Football</i>'s constantly shifting, implacable emotional pull. There isn’t much insight as to what inspired Kinsella’s lyrics and he didn’t emote harder or rawer than anyone else. But Holmes and Kinsella’s guitar playing is the most emotive the genre has been privy to, inverting the typical power trio dynamic and rendering Kinsella’s minimal lyrics as a platform for elaboration rather than the final word.</p>
<p>Very little of <i>American Football</i> is in a minor key and almost none of it can be performed on a single guitar, so it’s not explicitly heartbroken music, nor is it ever entirely joyous. Rather than pinpoint an emotion, the record exists on a continuum. There’s no right answer as to whether “The Summer Ends” is a devotional, a last goodbye, or some combination of the two—the ache and beauty are intertwined. Instrumental ""You Know I Should Be Leaving Soon” is the album's most playful cut, and it’s similarly open to interpretation: is it about leaving soon because everyone has to eventually get on with their day after spending the night together, or is it about <i>leaving</i>—like, for good? Nothing suggests a typical narrative arc, but it's worth noting that the song that follows ""You Know I Should Be Leaving Soon"" is called “But the Regrets are Killing Me”, and after that, “I’ll See You When We’re Both Not So Emotional” (let it be said, these guys had a sense of humor). <i>American Football</i> operates from a mindset where everything is about to happen, and that inability to stay present is a feeling that’s neither teenage nor see-through nor false.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-8c2ef48a-154e-2ee7-f3f3-c6fae7febed0""><i>American Football </i>was released in September of 1999, which lends the album a real-time immediacy: the lyrics begin in June and end in August, surely a powerful period of time for teenagers and college-bound kids (American Football were University of Illinois students at the time). Unless you’re a teacher or NFL player, though, the typical adult's day-to-day doesn’t change all that much during the summer—it’s hotter, there are dumber movies in the theater, and that's about it. And yet, those same see-through teenage feelings can still manifest during the change of the seasons, regardless of age; there are many reasons <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7KNRC8SSAw&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Indian Summer”</a> is one of the most frequently covered indie rock songs, and similarly we're only now beginning to recognize how <i>American Football </i>struck an emotional chord, one that’s proven to be every bit as resonant.</span></p></div>"|19352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19352-american-football-american-football/|8.6|Ian Cohen

Fec’s work as Tobacco is frequently approached as a dichotomy of beauty and ugliness; on <i>Ultima</i>'s front half<i>,</i> the ""ugly"" quotient has been ramped up to match the project's warped, grotty imagery.</p>
<p>The album's standouts signify an evolved sound. Obscene, rowdy, and fun, “Eruption (Gonna Get My Hair Cut At The End of the Summer)” is aggro-R&amp;B cut with a dose of Minneapolis funk, while album opener “Streaker”, which features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"">Beck</a> collaborator Brian LeBarton, is grindhouse glam rock with heavy artillery.  Fec claims in a press release that <i>Ultima II Massage</i> is the “definitive end” to his conceptual aims, and he ends up with a zombified mix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8549-marc-bolan/"">Marc Bolan</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> doused in the industrial scuzz and slime of Tobacco’s customary sonics and executed with puerile glee.</p>
<p>Lyrically, <i>Ultima II Massage</i> is in line with previous Tobacco efforts. Fec is, in his own way, a sensual songwriter, his lyrics are calculated for visceral impact—so there’s plenty of material about popsicles, ejaculation, and fruit, naturally, along with various skin-crawling ephemera. Obscenity is applied liberally, moreso than on past releases; Fec has said that Tobacco's associated imagery draws inspiration from a pre-pubescent mindset, and here he possesses all the excitement of a kid who’s just discovered the full power of the word “motherfucker” for the first time.</p>
<p><i>Ultima</i><i>’s</i> less gentle tracks are a welcome evolution in Tobacco's music, but the old, swooning BMSR sound--scarred, melodic music that sounds as if it’s just starting to rot--pops up now and again. Occasionally, Fec finds a sweet spot between the two poles, an approach that's crystallized on the violently saccharine “Lipstick Destroyer”. “Creaming for Beginners”, meanwhile, is a heavily distorted ballad with a blistering, slow-burning melody.</p>
<p>Overall, though, Fec doesn't always achieve that balance, so there's several mid-album cuts here that jog in place despite their inherent prettiness, speaking to the album's uneven momentum as a whole. While<i> Ultima II Massage </i>starts off with material that's heavier and meaner than anything he’s done previously, the lighter sound of the album's back half can't help but come across as a drop in ambition, turning down the volume on what could've been the most dynamic Tobacco record to date.</p></div>"|19388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19388-tobacco-ultima-ii-massage/|6.9|Jonah Bromwich

Reynolds looks prescient now: grime, minus its thickly accented MCs, saw a major resurgence in 2013. The sound went global, too, as producers from <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/therabit"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Texas</a> to <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/dj-prettybwoy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tokyo</a> aided a gaggle of UK artists in re-introducing grime's cagey melodic contortions to club culture.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As heads of the <a href=""http://www.butterz.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Butterz</a> label (and the eponymous recurring party), Elijah &amp; Skilliam have been central to London grime's re-emergence. Their imprint outstrips newfound interest in the style: since 2010, their label has housed grime veterans (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17191-terror-danjah/"">Terror Danjah</a>) and fostered new talent (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30768-royal-t/"">Royal-T</a>). Their weekly radio show on Rinse FM has served as a hub for the sound's widening pallette. Alongside <a href=""http://keysoundrecordings.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Keysound Recordings</a>, <a href=""http://www.hyperdub.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hyperdub</a>, and <a href=""http://nightslugs.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Night Slugs</a> Butterz has erected a platform for grime more durable and prominent than that of its heyday, clearing space for veterans such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4645-wiley/"">Wiley</a> and Footsie to co-habitate with the upstarts.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The genre now encompasses everything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31592-visionist/"">Visionist</a>'s nimble dub mutations to Preditah's reptilian lumber, but it's generally characterized by stabbing mid-range synthesizers, spare, idiosyncratic percussion, a deep-space sub. The mark of a good grime track seems to be just how unstable it can sound, taking a childlike glee in contrasting pretty, ethereal melodies with amoeba-like sub-bass.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Fabriclive 75</i> is the pair's second official mix CD, following their 2011 effort for Rinse's series. They're unique in that they're not producers, instead functioning as true scene stewards. As such, <i>Fabriclive 75</i> serves as an overview of the producers and tracks in their orbit rather than as a representation of their DJ sets. They peddle a distinctly UK sound, largely focusing on grime's chunky mid-range gymnastics but also incorporating the clubbier house sounds of UK Funky while ignoring recent trap and footwork influences. There are lots of dark, outre sounds on <i>Fabriclive 75</i> but the overall effect is cheeky and effusive. It's difficult to imagine dancing to much of <i>Fabriclive 75</i>, but it <i>is</i> party music, better suited for having some beers and bouncing around than getting stoned in your living room.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When you listen to old grime tapes (<i>the Wire</i> has a potent collection <a href=""http://www.thewire.co.uk/audio/tracks/a-brief-history-of-grime-tapes?SELECT%20*%20%20FROM%20request_redirect"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), their roughness is inescapable: awkward cuts, run-backs, dropped sound, lots of airhorn. Even more recent efforts, such as DJ Slimzee and the always golden Flow Dan's <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mcflowdan/exclusive-slimzee-flowdan"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Radio 1 mix</a>, have a homespun, improvisational quality to them. Grime MCs, like the jungle and UK Garage MCs before them, emerged from the storied tradition of reggae soundclashes: a constant dialogue with the selector interspersed with boasts and taunts. In retrospect, it's obvious why grime MCs never made good hip-hop records: these guys are inveterate shit-talkers, not storytellers. (Grime as a pop phenomenon, though, has also <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/27/second-coming-of-grime-dizzee-rascal-wiley"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">experienced a resurgence</a> in the UK.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The 70-minute mix DJ mix, in comparison, is a relatively ascetic, formal environment, one where rough cuts can't simply be attributed to the DJs playing to the crowd's energy. <i>Fabriclive 75</i> suffers at times, due in part to Elijah &amp; Skilliam's choice to showcase such a wide variety of sounds. Mixing in and out of tracks such as Joker and Swindle's blockbuster anthem as 040 ""Let It Be Known"" and Murlo's slinky lullaby ""Into Mist"" is difficult even under more forgiving circumstances. Some of the best cuts the duo selects—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30199-dj-q/"">DJ Q</a>'s ""Two Faced"" into Sir Spyro's grind-worthy ""Pull It Up""—have more to do with house and R&amp;B than grime.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Fabriclive 75</i> survives some rough patches, though, because it's a bounty of vibrant, creative music. A couple of proper dubs—with grime MCs hyping Elijah &amp; Skilliam over familar tracks—are a nice touch and a nod to the increasing frequency with which MCs are being invited back into the booth.  It's a bit difficult to recommend in light of Elijah &amp; Skilliam's Rinse mix—less comprehensive but fiercer—and, more importantly, their weekly (and <a href=""http://rinse.fm/podcasts/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">downloadable</a>) show for Rinse, which is both free and a more natural way to follow the ebbs and flows of the scene. As a jumping off point for further exploration, though, you won't find a more concise or considered collection of grime's talents.</p></div>"|19348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19348-elijah-and-skilliam-fabriclive-75/|6.7|Andrew Gaerig

The title is a tipoff: “Sound on Sound” is built on a stratum of radio-degraded voice samples and static, and over all of that, a lopsided rhythm of minimal drums and wiry bass limps along, stretching empty space over its own rickety skeleton. Guitar harmonics ping like sonar, and no riffs are brought to bear. Guitarist Tim Kerr takes the mic from the band’s buoyant, bellicose frontman Randy “Biscuit” Turner, and instead of bellowing, he speaks simply yet cryptically, his voice both intimate and distant. It’s spacious, but that space screams. Contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2906-mission-of-burma/"">Mission of Burma</a> sound metal by comparison. The subtle stasis of tension and release is enough to pluck nerves.</p>
<p><i>Lullabies</i>, along with Big Boys’ swansong, 1985’s <i>No Matter How Long the Line at the Cafeteria, There’s Always a Seat</i>, are being reissued as discrete entities after spending two decades shoehorned together on the Touch and Go anthology <i>The Fat Elvis</i>.

The title is a tipoff: “Sound on Sound” is built on a stratum of radio-degraded voice samples and static, and over all of that, a lopsided rhythm of minimal drums and wiry bass limps along, stretching empty space over its own rickety skeleton. Guitar harmonics ping like sonar, and no riffs are brought to bear. Guitarist Tim Kerr takes the mic from the band’s buoyant, bellicose frontman Randy “Biscuit” Turner, and instead of bellowing, he speaks simply yet cryptically, his voice both intimate and distant. It’s spacious, but that space screams. Contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2906-mission-of-burma/"">Mission of Burma</a> sound metal by comparison. The subtle stasis of tension and release is enough to pluck nerves.</p>
<p><i>Lullabies</i>, along with Big Boys’ swansong, 1985’s <i>No Matter How Long the Line at the Cafeteria, There’s Always a Seat</i>, are being reissued as discrete entities after spending two decades shoehorned together on the Touch and Go anthology <i>The Fat Elvis</i>.

That glistening anti-koan punctuates the chorus of Coldplay's skyscraping 2005 single ""Speed of Sound"", and the lyric's profound meaninglessness has doubled as a mission statement for the mega-band's career thus far. They've established a reputation as mainstream rock's koi pond architects, designing music that's deceptively shallow but, if caught at the right moment, shimmeringly beautiful, to the point that you could focus on it for hours.</p>
<p>Impossibly indulgent on a sonic level while retaining the intellectual depth of a cell phone commercial, Coldplay's catalog is largely experiential—a reflecting pool for the hopes, dreams, and heartaches that listeners wish to apply to the music. This pliability has meant that Coldplay can come off as impersonal, a gaseous giant of anonymity in rock music's solar system; nearly 10 years ago, the stultifyingly dense third album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1541-xy/""><i>X&amp;Y</i></a> threatened to swallow the band completely, as Coldplay refined the post-post-punk affectations of 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1538-a-rush-of-blood-to-the-head/""><i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i></a> until they were left with an immobile monolith.</p>
<p>On the verge of overreaching, Coldplay doubled down with 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11621-viva-la-vida-or-death-and-all-his-friends/""><i>Viva La Vida</i> <i>or Death and All His Friends</i></a>, a world-beating document of giddy experimentation and costume-rock bathos that stands as their most thrilling, impressionistic work. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15953-mylo-xyloto/""><i>Mylo Xyloto</i></a> followed three years later, which took its predecessor's widescreen template and enlarged it to IMAX-size, indulging in rave-y piano stabs and night-flight flourishes with the color-filled exuberance of a child that can't stop eating crayons.</p>
<p><i>Mylo Xyloto</i> was further proof that Coldplay are at their best when they embrace their corniest impulses; their sixth album, <i>Ghost Stories</i>, finds them taking a sharp left turn. Preceded by the non-single ""Midnight"", a watery electro-folk Bon Iver facsimile accompanied with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54115-video-coldplay-midnight/"">a video reminiscent of an iTunes visualizer</a>, nearly everything about the arrival of <i>Ghost Stories</i> has seemed small: the nine-song tracklist, the spartan, deep-blue angel's-wings cover, <a href=""http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/news/54115/4625afc8.jpg"">the disappointing lack of costumes</a>. The absence of grandiosity signaled to eager fans and sneering bystanders alike that, this time around, something might be a little off.</p>
<p>That something can be traced to Martin's marriage to actress and $600-hand-cream guru Gwyneth Paltrow, which quietly imploded in March of this year. More a <a href=""http://www.goop.com/journal/be/conscious-uncoupling"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">separation</a> than an outright divorce, recent court documents revealed that the couple are <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2014/05/15/gwyneth-paltrow-permanent-restraining-order-divorce-conscious-uncoupling/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">still living together</a>, and in a <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=XJj9SR3-aSgC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=coldplay+spin+2008&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-IUk7GEq73&amp;sig=GbmDKIsytxwVvfEUvBQ8b1FOX9w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aAd6U8fnOK7JsQSng4GgBg&amp;ved=0CIgBEOgBMA4#v=onepage&amp;q=coldplay%20spin%202008&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2008 SPIN profile</a>, the only subject that the otherwise affable Martin bristled against discussing was his personal life with Paltrow. As long as the world's known him, Chris Martin has also proved impossible to truly <i>know</i>, so whether his recent familial troubles would seep into his band's latest was anyone's guess.</p>
<p>And yet, <i>Ghost Stories</i> is unmistakably Coldplay's ""breakup album,"" a subdued work that finds Martin and his band crisply moping through mid-tempo soundscapes and fuzzy electronic touches that have the visceral impact of a down comforter tumbling down a flight of stairs. Featuring production from longtime collaborators Daniel Green and Rik Simpson, along with behind-the-boards pro Paul Epworth, drone-techno auteur Jon Hopkins, and Kanye West collaborator Mike Dean, the record is serene and weightless to a fault. Coldplay abandon the musical tourism and extroverted strides of their last few albums and find themselves adrift.</p>
<p>The closest the record comes to a bona fide anthem is the moderately enjoyable ""A Sky Full of Stars"", a rocket-fueled single on the level of ""Clocks"" and ""Speed of Sound"" tainted by Swedish dance producer AVICII's cheap-sounding drum presets and boilerplate synth motifs. ""I don't care/ If you tear me apart,"" Martin wails at the peak of the song's endless chorus, a passionate exclamation that doubles one of the most nakedly personal admissions he's made on record.</p>
<p><i>Ghost Stories</i> certainly sounds like the product of someone working out their private pain in public; unfortunately, the results are less <i>Blood on the Tracks</i> and more <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2x55D8zS_E&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Can I Borrow a Feeling?""</a>. Coldplay's catalog has <a href=""http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/coldplay/clocks.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">plenty of</a> <a href=""http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/coldplay/spies.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">examples where</a> <a href=""http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/coldplay/glassofwater.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Martin's words have</a> <a href=""http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/coldplay/everyteardropisawaterfall.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">failed him</a>, but his diaristic reflections on <i>Ghost Stories</i> are abnormally painful. ""Tell me you love me/ If you don't, then lie,"" he coos on the Spandau Ballet-gone-Disney ballad ""True Love""; during the plodding ""Another's Arms"", he ruminates on lost domestic bliss watching TV with a loved one, ""Your body on my body."" If the expression of carnal closeness-via-TiVo makes you cringe, imagine how <i>he</i> feels.</p>
<p>""Ink"" is the album's most indefensible moment, musically and lyrically, and the song handily snatches the title of Worst Coldplay Song from <i>X&amp;Y</i>'s impossibly leaden, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fuckin'-magnets</a> stinker ""What If"". ""Got a tattoo/ And the pain's alright,"" Martin cries while running through a series of love-as-permanence metaphors, over rippling guitar and burbling atmospherics <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIVaUcE4kAM&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ripped from Phil Collins' <i>Tarzan</i> soundtrack</a>. The last time Coldplay indulged in ""rainforest rock,"" it was <i>Viva La Vida</i>'s transcendent, gorgeous ""Strawberry Swing"", which featured Martin exclaiming beatifically, ""It's such a perfect day""; on ""Ink"", he moves from vine to vine until swinging in solitude at the track's end, exclaiming with a sigh, ""All I know is that I love you so/ So much that it hurts.""</p>
<p>Fittingly, ""Ink"" is one of the few tracks on <i>Ghost Stories</i> that leaves a mark, and that's partially due to Martin's lovely-as-ever vocals; when not chronicling his own pain, he occasionally breaks into appealing birdsong, a wordless pitter-patter that marks the chorus of the record's pleasant-enough lead single, ""Magic"". Otherwise, <i>Ghost Stories</i> is a collection of unmemorable songs from a band that's made enough memories to last a lifetime. Everything sounds pristine—this <i>is</i> a Coldplay album, and instrumentally the band is as exacting as ever—but by the dreary piano-led closer ""O"", you're left with a series of songs that are fragile, plain, and forgettable.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom says <i>X&amp;Y</i> is Coldplay's worst album, but amidst that record's shiftless bloat, there were <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k_1kvDh2UA&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">real-deal highlights</a> that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUvDJhfNhs&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hit with blunt impact</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4V3Mo61fJM&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">have since stood the test of time</a>. <i>Ghost Stories</i> contains no such moments, and thus threatens to rob <i>X&amp;Y</i> of its dubious title. Its intimate nature shares the most kinship with Coldplay's first album, 2000's peerless <i>Parachutes</i>. Twelve years later, that album sounds like the work of a different band, and that's because it is; Coldplay have become one of the biggest acts in the world since their comparatively modest debut, and as a result <i>Ghost Stories</i>' attempts to return to close-mic'd intimacy come across as out-of-touch as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl_Qyk9DSUw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lucille Bluth asking how much a banana costs</a>.</p>
<p>The callback to <i>Parachutes</i>' hushed whispers also means that <i>Ghost Stories</i> is the first time Coldplay has sounded explicitly self-referential. They're a band that's withstood enough comparisons to U2 over the years, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8330-how-to-dismantle-an-atomic-bomb/"">warmed-over</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12730-no-line-on-the-horizon/"">leftovers</a> that have marked Bono and Co.'s last decade as a creative entity are enough to suggest that, if Coldplay continue to head down the path of addressing their own legacy, their best moments are truly behind them.</p></div>"|19344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19344-coldplay-ghost-stories/|4.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

That’s a lesson many people in have learned the hard way in Hollywood, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9172-cold-cave"">and to hear Wesley Eisold tell it,</a> he's one of them. His last <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"">Cold Cave</a> record, 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15284-cherish-the-light-years/""><i>Cherish the Light Years</i></a>, was an explosive lunar launch that embraced every opportunity to tell you how awesome it was<b>—</b>nothing but souped-up goth-rock jock jams, bombastic lyrics and hyper-loud Brick Wall of China production. And yet, it failed to satisfy the one person most invested in its success:  Wesley Eisold. Eisold told us that <i>Cherish the Light Years</i> is “the Cold Cave I can’t stand to hear,” and in the time since, he’s treated 2011 like a rejected transplant.</p>
<p>But in addition to separating himself from former collaborators, dealing with his internal demons and <a href=""http://www.chartattack.com/news/2013/06/26/news-cold-cave-concerts-cancelled-in-toronto-and-montreal-due-to-opener-boyd-rices-past-nazi-affiliations/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">external demonization</a>, Eisold got a prosthetic limb after spending his entire life hiding his missing left hand. The metaphor wasn’t lost on him<b>—</b>it’s a sign of being accountable, refusing to think of himself as a victim. These are themes that Eisold dealt with on the singles he intermittently released during 2013 as a free agent from Matador Records, and <i>Full Cold Moon</i> collects them to create an account of the imperfect progress of someone trying to take back control of his life.</p>
<p>So is <i>Full Cold Moon</i> the ""new Cold Cave album""? Not really<b>—</b>though in a strange way, the familiarity of these songs make it far more “singles”-packed than the overtly commercial <i>Cherish the Light Years</i>.  Eisold claims the new material is more “honest” as well, and that can be taken a number of ways, depending on whether you think the tag is a preemptive strike against the idea that he didn’t have much choice but to make more humble-sounding music. It’s clear that Eisold can’t stop writing anthems, as “Don’t Blow Up the Moon”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15223-cold-cave-god-made-the-world/"">""God Made the World""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15141-cold-cave-people-are-poison/"">“People are Poison”</a> are every bit as broad and striving as their titles indicate.  But while the songs are fully-formed, the production has a demo-like starkness and the underlying instrumentation is dank, rudimentary stuff that sounds like one man in his home studio, accountable to no one besides himself.</p>
<p>On opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14291-a-little-death-to-laugh/"">“A Little Death to Laugh”</a>, synths bleep like first-gen ringtones over unyielding, old-school machine beats and wormy bass while Eisold inverts his prior vocal performances, sounding like he’s being deflated rather than projecting outwards. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15025-oceans-with-no-end/"">“Oceans With No End”</a> and “Black Boots”, two singles which immediately recall the rock dynamics of Eisold’s recent past than the New Romantic S&amp;M of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13383-love-comes-close/""><i>Loves Come Close</i></a>, are among his strongest and most passionate work—but they’re also the songs on this release that could’ve used bolder presentation or a dynamic shift to turn their choruses into legitimate singalongs.</p>
<p>That said, even if Chris Coady’s hyper-compressed production on <i>Cherish the Light Years</i> is occasionally missed, over the span of an entire album, it was like a corset<b>—</b>meant to enhance and excite the onlooker, but it sure seemed painful for long periods of time. Eisold sounds freed on the first quarter of <i>Full Cold Moon</i>, which is almost an EP unto itself that reminds you Eisold <i>is</i> Cold Cave, and the project will sound however he chooses. After ""A Little Death to Laugh"", “Young Prisoner Dreams of Romance” is a black-on-black leatherbound punk burner that’s over almost as soon as you read the title, immediately followed by the off-kilter, strangely beautiful coldwave instrumental “Tristan Corbière.”</p>
<p>But <i>Full Cold Moon</i> is more honest in the sense that Eisold is asking himself harder questions than he did on songs like “Underworld USA”, which were necessarily blank. It’s a shame that Eisold’s vocals are mixed curiously low; for one thing, they minimize the impact of his melodies, the immediate advantage he has over the hundreds of mid-fi coldwavers working in a similar range. Without the lyrics sheet, you can completely overlook his searching, often searing self-reckoning. During “A Little Death to Laugh”, Eisold mutters “I lost a limb on the left hand path/ And I never ever got it back”, a double entendre with a hell of a lot of resonance considering Eisold’s life story as well as Cold Cave's aesthetic. Meanwhile, “People are Poison” sidesteps the potentially Reznor-esque notebook scrawling to flatly state, “You better die young or you will be me or something/ And then they will say ‘in your prime, you were nothing.’”  </p>
<p>There’s a good chance your appreciation for <i>Full Cold Moon</i> will be inversely proportional to your appreciation of <i>Cherish the Light Years</i>’ flair for the dramatic, but remember that <i>Cherish the Light Years</i> is actually an outlier in Cold Cave’s discography<b>—</b>go back even further beyond the industrial <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order"">New Order</a> of <i>Love Comes Close</i>, to the days when Cold Cave was a noise project closer to former bandmate Dominick Fernow’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient"">Prurient</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode"">Depeche Mode</a>.</p>
<p>As to what Cold Cave is now, “Meaningful Life” is coincidentally stuck right in the middle of <i>Full Cold Moon</i> and is presented as a kind of spiritual crossroads for Eisold. It’s an eerie, free-floating meditation of organ and flutes reduced to 8-bit versions of themselves. As for Eisold<b>: </b>some people live very meaningful lives, some don’t. Which one will he choose?

In 1983, a guy named Randall Wulff showed up at Music Lab studio in Los Angeles with a white Mercedes convertible, a beautiful girlfriend, perfect hair, and a handful of ethereal synth-pop-folk tunes. Wulff then hired photographer <a href=""http://edwardcolver.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ed Colver</a>, best known for documenting the West Coast punk scene, to shoot the starkly monochromatic album cover. By the time Colver realized the check had bounced, Wulff had disappeared. There were rumors that he had gone to Las Vegas or possibly Hawaii, but most likely he had returned to Alberta, Canada, where nearly twenty-five years later a vinyl collector named Jon Murphy came across a copy of <i>L’Amour</i> at a flea market.</p>
<p>Full of gently dissolving melodies and gossamer synths (credited to a guy named Philip Lees, also a mystery), the album has become crate-digger lore, as much for the backstory as for the music itself. As of this reissue, Wulff remains at large. Was he a con man, as some claim? A drug dealer, as others attest? An apparition? An alien visitor? A record collector hoax? Did he really have connections to the Duke Power fortune? Was he really involved with Christie Brinkley? How does cowboy novelist Louis L’Amour fit into the story? And where is Wulff now, if he is still around? <a href=""http://www.jackdfleischer.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jack D. Fleischer</a>, the filmmaker/historian who penned the liners and spent years looking for the artist, tracked down Wulff’s nephew, who had vivid memories of his uncle but lost touch with him many years ago. Fleischer came across another pseudonym under which Wulff recorded a few other albums, but he neglects to disclose the name. “As of this writing,” he notes, “Randall is essentially a ghost.”</p>
<p>The hazy story doesn’t bolster the music, but rather seems an extension of this strange and singular album. If you think of Los Angeles in the early ‘80s, you’re probably thinking New Wave synth-pop, cocaine-fueled and neon-lit—and <i>L’Amour</i> is anything but. Rather than sunny and hook-laden, these songs convey an ephemeral melancholy, blurred at the edges yet more potent for being somewhat indistinct. This is music of retreat, not assertion. The synths rise and ebb curiously, occasionally punctuating the songs with quiet starbursts but mostly moving with a logic of their own, often with no regard for Lewis’s vocals or piano playing. He doesn’t sing so much as he mumbles melodically, as though perpetually falling awake. The effect is quieting but too spooky to be New Agey. If Randall Wulff was an L.A. player, then Lewis was a bedroom auteur.</p>
<p><i>L’Amour</i> sounds like double-exposed film: full of odd, unrecognizable shapes that fade and overlap seemingly at uncalculated angles. Any concrete theme must be deduced not from the lyrics—which are persistently unintelligible—but from song titles like “I Thought the World of You” and “Even Rainbows Turn Blue”, which hint at the album’s ruminative mood. Lewis intimates romantic longing on a cellular level, and even the reveries implied by “Let’s Fall in Love Tonight” and “Romance for Two” (dedicated to Brinkley) sound more like memories of bliss than promises of future happiness. Yet, despite the album cover's implication, Lewis is no weepy miserability; rather, these songs project a world-weary dignity. “Love Showered Me” ripples with sci-fi synth burbles, as Lewis testifies tenderly, his voice fading from a relatively assertive croon to a hollowed-out whisper. It’s a peculiar performance, yet powerful.</p>
<p>The jauntiest tune here is “Cool Night in Paris”, which mixes vague chanson with what sounds like acoustic blues picking. Lewis’s voice is all cooed vowels, as though you’re overhearing a passerby speaking a strange language, yet he nimbly punctuates his sweet nothings with a sharp, decisive guitar lick, which may be the most straightforward thing on the entire album. It’s the Seine glimpsed in a half-remembered dream, referring not to a particular place but to the idea of that place. Likewise, the subtle allusions to ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" on ""Romance for ""Two"" and to ""Funny How Time Slips Away"" on ""Things Just Happen That Way"" are inscrutable, especially because Lewis doesn't seem to inhabit the same world as Frankie Valli or Willie Nelson.</p>
<p>Did Wulff intend those specific references? Or are the resemblances merely in the imagination of the listener trying to make sense of the music? It’s impossible to tell with this Rorschach of an album. These songs work by insinuation: the way the synths sidle up to the piano on “Like to See You Again”, the way Lewis’s illegible vocals imply indecipherable meaning, the way the album ultimately invades your imagination. It can be weirdly addictive, with each subsequent listen promising to reveal some essential secret or shed light on the man on the album cover. Instead, somehow <i>L’Amour</i> sounds less there with each spin, beckoning you into its hazy world even as it dissolves into gray. The mystery is so perfect that it’d be a tragedy to solve it.</p></div>"|19389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19389-lewis-lamour/|8.6|Stephen M. Deusner

As the frontwoman of the L.A.-based projects <a href=""http://thenocturnes.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Nocturnes</a> and <a href=""http://marriagesmusic.bandcamp.com/album/kitsune"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marriages</a>, her eerie voice has been all but smothered by male accompanists, prog denseness, cyclonic distortion, or her own hushed delivery. The fact that she’s a stunningly supple and versatile guitarist—her skills are a vital component of the post-rock ensemble <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA7ibJkeNfU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Red Sparowes</a>—hasn’t given her that much reason to step up her vocal game. Even her previous <a href=""http://emmaruthrundle.bandcamp.com/album/electric-guitar-one"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">solo material</a> has been guitar-centric and mostly instrumental. But Rundle’s new solo album, <i>Some Heavy Ocean</i>, is different. She not only sings, she does so a <i>lot</i>—and when she does, she soars.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the album sounds triumphant. <i>Some Heavy Ocean </i>is a black hole of anti-happiness, a heart-shaped growth of dark matter. Veins of inky folk run through “Shadows of My Name” and “Oh Sarah”, songs that encompass the scope of Rundle’s acoustic prowess: On the former, she attacks her strings as if they’re barbed wire that must be breached with her bare hands; on the latter, she fingerpicks with fluid delicacy. As sharp and vivid as her playing is, though, the clouds are always near. Swathes of strings and overdriven twang cast long shadows, and the intermittent drums rattle like bones in a box. Even the two brief, ethereal interludes, “Some Heavy Ocean” and “Your Card the Sun”, seem more like frozen chunks of time than mere placeholders. Far more than anything she’s done prior, the album is a dynamic, breath-snatching statement of intent that’s part lullaby, part night terror.</p>
<p>The biggest leap found on <i>Some Heavy Ocean</i> is Rundle’s voice. On “Shadows of My Name,” her reverb-shrouded vocals dart in and out of the mix, flashing fragments of language rather than distinct lines; in the chorus, she works herself up into nerve-pinching growl that’s recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a> at her most unhinged. Throughout the rest of tracks—particularly the mournful yet urgent “Run Forever”—Rundle’s comes across like a student of both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29711-chelsea-wolfe/"">Chelsea Wolfe</a>’s frigid intonation and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a>’s gloomy coo. As a singer, Rundle now sounds whole, and better yet, she’s gravitated toward a timeless resonance. The post-metal and shoegaze sounds she’s employed before have been left for something broader. When, on “Haunted Houses”, she warns of a distance that must be kept between her and the unnamed target of her simmering wrath, she evokes Stevie Nicks; having another song titled “Oh Sarah” only reinforces that impression, although that track’s candlelit, folk-rock balladry bears just a vague kinship to Fleetwood Mac’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJb87nNsGY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Sara”</a>.</p>
<p>Rundle’s lyrics, where they can be fully pieced together, are the weakest element of <i>Some Heavy Ocean</i>. There are only so many mentions of ghosts and graveyards that a record can take before it starts to feel cartoonishly goth, even when those motifs are woven into the music with such conviction and subtle shades of mood. That atmosphere works best when it strips away any hint of pale cliché and plunges under the ice; “Living with the Black Dog” is a droning, distorted, shadow-draped leviathan of a song, one in which Rundle breaks away from spooky folk and edges closer toward <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>’s recent forays into chthonic Americana. Not only does it conclude the album on an ominous, ambitious note, it reconciles every medium she’s worked in so far: melody, noise, softness, severity, and a sense of quiet drama and melancholy. <i>Some Heavy Ocean</i> stands as Rundle’s first fully realized release as a singer-songwriter—and while its monochrome scale is narrow, she makes harrowing grays out of it. </p></div>"|19241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19241-emma-ruth-rundle-some-heavy-ocean/|7.4|Jason Heller

Orchestral composers are presumed to be so sealed off from popular pursuits, it seems, that he may as well be a Catholic priest that skydives, or a Supreme Court Justice with a sideline in mixed martial arts. A line he often feeds journalists is that the orchestra is like ""the world's greatest synthesizer,"" an analogy so head-patting in its patronizing simplicity I imagine he's rolling his eyes inwardly as he says it.</p>
<p>But the analogy nonetheless points to the way Bates works—he's fascinated by <i>sounds</i>, and it doesn't matter where they come from. His imagination for tone colors and textures is obvious on <i>Stereo Is King</i>, and they unfold across a spectrum. Like the composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18244-daniel-wohl-corps-exquis/"">Daniel Wohl</a>, Bates' recorded music explores a rich nexus where organic sounds blur into digital ones, and <i>Stereo Is King</i> basically eradicates your need, while it is playing, to even make such distinctions. When he performs his pieces live with an orchestra, he pointedly underlines this approach, standing all the way in the back of the massed forces, hunched over a laptop and sending little glitches and ripples out over the seething field of sound around him.</p>
<p>On <i>Stereo Is King</i>'s title track, Bates paints a landscape of a thousand noises on an equal playing field. The first minute of the title piece has marimba, glockenspiel, bells, possibly some sampled chirping crickets—all in the first minute. Some light smudges of digital activity crackle in the corners and in the foreground. These graceful intrusions hit the surface of his orchestral writing like a skipping rock. They remind us forcefully that in our headphones, the separation of ""real"" and ""fake"" sounds is a trick we play on ourselves.</p>
<p> There are many different kinds of pieces on <i>Stereo</i>—""Observer in the Magellanic Cloud"" pairs choral chanting with rolled ""r""s and a metronome beep. The choral writing fans out into grunts and exclamations before assembling again, like a gas cloud, into a reverent hum. The metronome beep fades, imperceptibly, into the choral writing, and back out again—a tagged tracer for Bates' ideas about the mutability of sounds. ""White Lies for  Lomax"", meanwhile, dreams up new field recordings that Lomax never happened across, the piano wandering airily in and out of concrete blues language. Six minutes in, an actual field recording floats in, but so quietly that it seems to be intruding into your headphone space from outside. (The first time I listened, I actually took my headphones off to make sure it was part of the music.) </p>
<p>What unites all of these pieces is, simply, Bates' roving mind. ""Terrycloth Troposphere"" lovingly disassembles some of the key parts in  Terry Riley's ""In C"". ""String Band"" re-imagines classic string band music as a bunch of straining tendons, strings that moan and approach snapping. All of them travel from their origin point into Bates' world, a place where sounds exist, if not independent of their makers, then attached to them by a remarkably loose tether, gathering overhead like helium balloons ready to slip. </p></div>"|19331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19331-mason-bates-stereo-is-king/|7.5|Jayson Greene

He’s been a musician in the public eye for nearly half of his life, and over the past decade, he’d be most accurately described as a folk artist. His latest album <i>Upside Down Mountain</i> is being released on Nonesuch, a label whose release slate includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys"">the Black Keys</a>, Natalie Merchant, and Nickel Creek. The cover art is designed by one of the guys in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5686-the-felice-brothers"">the Felice Brothers</a>, and he’ll be trekking around the country with Dawes. The moment you hear Oberst sing, though, you will forget every single one of these facts and remember every positive <i>and</i> negative association you have with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes"">Bright Eyes</a> instead<i>—</i>there’s just no mistaking him for anyone else at this point, and it’s unclear how he feels about that. While claiming “this is a return to an earlier way I wrote"",<i> Upside Down Mountain</i> is Oberst’s latest documentation of his obsessions with escape, death, the passing of time, and the potential of finding serenity in an assumed identity.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Upside Down M</i><i>ountain</i> isn't a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes/"">Bright Eyes</a> album, so Oberst’s not driven by the same incessant need for romantic and artistic validation that kept him going until <i>Lifted</i>, nor will circumstances ever align the way they did for his protracted 2005 critical breakthrough. On the plus side of the ledger, you can understand what the hell Oberst is talking about most of the time on <i>Upside Down Mountain</i>, which makes it an immediate improvement over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10095-cassadaga/""><i>Cassadaga</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15111-the-peoples-key/""><i>The People’s Key</i></a>, two albums that somehow managed to be cryptic and pedantic at the same time.</p>
<p>Besides possessing one of the strongest melodies Oberst has ever penned (and there are plenty here), “Time Forgot” is a welcome reintroduction to the guy who never had trouble getting his point across. Here, he longs to grow a beard, to be left alone, to let the wind scatter thoughts, to just <i>listen</i>. This puts him in a similar mindset as he was on his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12060-conor-oberst/"">self-titled record from 2008</a>, the last truly great thing he’s put his name on. But there’s been an unmistakable change of perspective<i>—</i>on <i>Conor Oberst</i> cuts like “I Don’t Want to Die (In the Hospital)”, death was impending because he was Conor Oberst, the wildly talented and self-destructive rock singer. Here, he’s not chasing death, but death will catch up with him because he’s Conor Oberst, human being.</p>
<p>The most resonant moments of <i>Upside Down Mountain</i> follow suit in deconstructing Oberst’s myth of himself<i>—</i>during the otherwise chintzy, rhinestone cowboy pop of “Hundreds of Ways”, “I hope I am forgotten when I die” is the most poisonously enunciated line on the LP. Meanwhile, on the mesmerizing minor-key whisper of “Artifact #1”, Oberst just wants to be forgotten while he’s alive<b><i>—</i></b>“I don’t want a second chance to be an object of desire/ if that means slipping through your hands.” Sometimes he even has a sense of humor about it all; though “Kick” is addressed to a luckless Kennedy, it’s not a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG6lTQNW04I&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Diane Young”</a>-style philosophical treatise, but rather one fuck-up relating to another. And when he admonishes a self-absorbed drunk during “Enola Gay”’s rummy strut, it might just be himself. The evocation of solitude in a crowded club links it back to his atomic self-pitying from <i>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</i>'s “Hit the Switch”, but anyone can learn from its hook: “The world’s mean, getting meaner too/ So why do you have to make it all about you?”</p>
<p>But elsewhere on <i>Upside Down Mountain</i>, he wields populist observation like a politician, trying to utilize his homespun wisdom from an elevated plane. Over a decade ago, he claimed “There is no truth, there is only you/ And what you make the truth”, and that sounds more convincing than his attempts to convey his own version of the truth as the genuine article. During “Time Forgot”, he muses, “They say everyone has a choice to make/ To be loved or to be free”, but, really, who <i>says</i> that?  He’s got a lot of big ideas about love throughout<i>—</i>“True love hides like city stars”, “Love was the message...full stop”, “Freedom is the opposite of love”, “Our love is a protective poison”, “There is no dignity in love.” It's easy to think of him like Don Draper, hacking out emotionally manipulative and impeccably worded pitches on a Coronet until something sticks.</p>
<p>His facility with pat truths is most evident in “You Are Your Mother’s Child”, a song that bears an instant resemblance to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/"">I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning</a></i>'s<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/""> </a></i>homemade valentine “First Day of My Life” in its unadorned simplicity. It’s open-ended enough to be adopted by anyone who wants it to be about <i>their </i>child, but after a striking, writerly first verse, an adolescent’s all-American upbringing feels less like an actual person’s experience than it does a songwriting exercise. It could’ve been written about anyone, but it also could’ve been written <i>by</i> anyone.</p>
<p>But it couldn’t have been <i>sung</i> that way, and the saving grace of <i>Upside Down Mountain</i> is that it makes the case for Oberst as a truly unique and remarkable vocalist.  Earlier in his career, his tremble, quaver and vibrato were seen as affectations of an amateur, but here they're all confidently and carefully utilized like a mastered instrument. For the most part, it gives character to gauzy C&amp;W like “Double Life” and the chugga-chugga festival-folk of “Zigzagging Toward The Light”, but he still has a way of throwing in awkward phrases that stick in your craw like popcorn kernels<i>—</i>“Snickers bar”, “Japanese arcade”, “Klonopin eyes”, and the pronunciation of “parlour trick” to sound like “politrick.”</p>
<p>One line in particular stands out<i>—</i>“I stole all the rhinestones from Carolina/ And sold them out in Bakersfield for cash.” Maybe it’s playing to <i>and</i> against type as the rambling folk artist, since Carolina and Bakersfield are as real as it gets, even if they’re being used as placeholders. It's the kind of line <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18-ryan-adams"">Ryan Adams</a> would unspool—a fitting association since <i>Upside Down Mountain</i> is essentially Oberst’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15907-ashes-fire/"">Ashes &amp; Fire</a>. </i>It's gorgeous to the point of near gaudiness, a “return to form” after a strange decade evolving from wildly prolific, heartbreak soundtracking, Winona Ryder-dating <i>enfant terrible</i> into a domesticated Americana bard no longer interested in why to be young is to be sad. Hopefully, Oberst will find a way to make ""older and wiser"" just as revelatory.</p></div>"|19256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19256-conor-oberst-upside-down-mountain/|6.5|Ian Cohen

But if you, say, had a hand in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/"">one of the best pop albums in years</a>, by the biggest pop star in the world, that <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5839818/beyonce-breaks-us-itunes-sales-record-sells-617000-in-three-days"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">immediately set sales records</a> after it arrived on iTunes as a surprise release, you just might have a shot—and that's where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a> collaborator and producer/singer/rapper Boots finds himself with his debut release, <i>WinterSpringSummerFall</i>.</p>
<p>As Boots, whose real name is Jordan Asher, showed on signature <i>Beyoncé</i> cuts like “Haunted” and “Blue”, he's adept at building tense, pretty atmospheres with his sweeping production. Most of <i>WinterSpringSummerFall </i>finds him working in the same realm, seamlessly moving through clattering, dance-oriented drum patterns, fuzzy synths, burbling bursts of electronic noise, and subdued piano ballads. While this scuzzy, genre-bending sonic palette doesn't deviate from what's come out of left-of-center R&amp;B in the last couple years, Asher's take is just flat-out better than much of the comparable stuff out there, boasting more technical command and, particularly, a more thorough knowledge of electronic music. Throughout much of the album, particularly in places like the romantic, dreamy “EST” and the sad, delicate “Atom”, <i>WinterSpringSummerFall</i> is unequivocally pleasant and pretty, with enough of a searing edge and emotional point of view to avoid falling into generic anonymity. Asher's voice is capable, if not exactly distinctive.</p>
<p>Jordan Asher has explained that the album is <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/naomizeichner/boots-winter-spring-summer-fall"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his chance to share his story</a> with those who were aware of his involvement in <i>Beyoncé</i> and wanted to know more.<i> </i>It goes something like this: Asher bounced around between bands and states of homelessness in Miami before he eventually moved to New York and signed a deal with Roc Nation. Career backstory aside, Asher alludes to incidents on the record that have serious resonance: his best friend drowned, and he also watched Joshua Basin, a 20-year-old <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/college-student-killed-train-fight-drunk-man-spilled-tracks-article-1.1050252"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">who was shoved onto Brooklyn's Bedford Avenue subway station tracks and hit by a train in 2012</a>, die in his arms. Unfortunately, apart from these brief moments, the tales told on <i>WinterSpringSummerFall </i>are kind of boring, and as a result the album frequently works best where Boots is saying the least.</p>
<p>Asher's songwriting often lacks inspiration, particularly when it leans on his wholly uncharismatic rapping. There's a common (and, in some cases, sexist) assumption that great pop music is mostly the work of the producers behind it, but, <i>WinterSpringSummerFall </i>suggests that, despite Asher's obvious talent and good instincts, he needs collaboration to bring out his best work  (as contributions from Kelela and Jeremih here show). As he mentioned <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9309-beyonces-muse/"" target=""_blank"">in his interview with Pitchfork</a>, Beyoncé's input strongly shaped and reshaped the way he produced certain songs on her album, and the lack of guidance is clearly felt on <i>WinterSpringSummerFall</i>'s missteps.</p>
<p>Asher has the tendency to hamstring his songs with clumsy raps; his delivery has the kind of slick patter and heavy-lidded, personality-bereft tone that's common for artists who are primarily singers. Since he doesn't provide much of his own personality to latch onto, it's hard to identify with his ranting about girls who only want to meet him so they can meet Jay Z, or meatheads in the Meatpacking District. Sometimes, he's sanctimonious (“That's 32 [bars] and I didn't even mention one motherfucking car”); elsewhere, his boasts sound hollow, especially since his good fortune is obviously not due to his talents as a rapper. The reasons for<i> WinterSpringSummerFall</i>'s lack of substance go beyond Asher's rapping skills: “Ride Ride Ride” ride, ride, rides the same pattern for too long, an embrace of repetition that might work if a vocalist more dynamic than Asher were delivering it. (It doesn't help matters, either, that his contributions to <i>Beyoncé</i> linger over this project, beyond the titular singer's enjoyable, if minor, contribution to album closer “Dreams”.)</p>
<p>That said, Asher isn't entirely adrift on his own. “My Heart Is A Stone Today (Unharmed)” coasts on a lovely falsetto and builds with a propulsive, insistent beat and scattered dance rhythms before breaking apart into a stunning piano ballad, and the simple house music nod “Fade Away” is the kind of whirlwind performance that could captivate an entire field of festival-goers.

He’s an American musician who spent a great deal of time growing up in Brazil, ultimately getting spewed out into the the public consciousness in the late 1970s No Wave scene as part of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1222-dna/"">DNA</a>. The band were short-lived, just like fellow New York corrupters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2897-mars/"">Mars</a>, but in Lindsay’s case it made sense that he’d want to move on quickly. Raised on a diet of tropicalia, punk, and avant garde impulses, he clearly wasn’t the kind of musician to get locked down in one style. The arrogance of youth played a part, too. On talking of DNA’s short history in Pitchfork contributor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/staff/marc-masters/"">Marc Masters</a>’ book <a href=""http://www.blackdogonline.com/all-books/no-wave.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>No Wave</i></a>, Lindsay said: “We had managed to make a great band—then I just tossed it away because I thought I’d do something else.”</p>
<p>Where that “something else” took him is documented on this compilation, a two-disc set released by <a href=""http://northernspyrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Northern Spy</a> that includes a fistful of tracks spanning Lindsay’s solo career circa 1996-2004. There’s a cohesion to the first disc, which includes 12 tracks culled from various albums, and often settles into the lilting tropicalia-influenced material Lindsay practiced following music made with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lurie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Lurie</a>’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lounge_Lizards"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lounge Lizards</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1749-golden-palominos/"">the Golden Palominos</a>, and his <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambitious_Lovers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ambitious Lovers</a> project. On the second disc, containing solo live recordings taken from performances in various venues between 2011 and 2012, he gets more abrasive, throwing shards of noise in among the prettiness, covering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> along the way, and generally illustrating how his no-fear approach to art has stuck with him as he enters his fifth decade of gelling inverse properties.</p>
<p>The first disc's standouts feature Lindsay vying with his peers, or at least leading them astray into his vision. On the wonderfully doomy “4 Skies” from <i>O Corpo Sutil (The Subtle Body)</i> he’s joined by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> (credited with “sonics”) and Amedeo Pace of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/395-blonde-redhead/"">Blonde Redhead</a>; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3683-ryuichi-sakamoto/"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a> lends piano and keyboards to two of the breezier tracks, “Simply Are” (from <i>Noon Chill</i>) and “Child Prodigy” (another <i>Subtle Body</i> cut). Lindsay’s approach is fascinating largely because of the way he flicks from relaxed to tightly wound in a heartbeat, making it sound like he’s soaking up the sun on some back porch somewhere and then unleashing a beat-heavy strain of claustrophobic electronics. On “Personagem” from <i>Salt</i> he’s somewhere in between all those things, filling the air with scratchy guitar, unhurried vocals, and arresting horns.</p>
<p>The misfires are few—which is surprising, considering it’s coming from someone so keen to look for joins where none are apparent. “Complicity” from 1996's <i>Mundo Civilizado</i> bears the marks of the times a little too overtly, with its reliance on overly compressed electronics and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1116-dj-spooky/"">DJ Spooky</a> guest appearance. Still, Lindsay rises above it, largely due to his sharp enunciation, positioned somewhere between wistful and hurt. The live material on the second disc feels like a great release of pressure after the meticulously arranged studio compositions that precede them. Lindsay barks and wails, shouting into the loneliness as his guitar feeds back against him, making it sound less like he’s playing and more like man and machine are brawling on the floor. The atonal workover of Prince’s “Erotic City” even elicits a few laughs from the crowd until Lindsay pummels all the sexuality out of it with great lumps of dissonant guitar.</p>
<p>The best way to experience this side of Lindsay’s career, to get a feel for where he likes to go and then utterly disembowel it, is to stack up versions of the same song from discs one and two of <i>Encyclopedia</i>. The original “Invoke” is all swooping strings and bright electronic pulses, while the live version sounds like someone being smacked in the face with a piece of sheet metal; “The Prize” is positively funky in recorded form, being built on a bedrock of dark analog bass synth, while live it’s utterly mechanical, stripped of all momentum, swapping swagger for tension. In most hands, a live album tacked onto a best-of compilation might seem like a cheap piece of padding, but this is a rare case where both documents feed off one another, even if it is in the most hostile way imaginable. Instead of trying to make sense of things, to summarize the unsummarizable, this compilation simply pits chaos and order against one another and lets a beautiful mess unfold.</p></div>"|19347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19347-arto-lindsay-the-encyclopedia-of-arto-lindsay/|7.7|Nick Neyland

They’ve made great albums, as well as horrible albums, and sometimes it’s hard to tell which album fits in which category. They’ve remained fairly prolific, even if their music has continually shed whatever pertinence it had to the world of music at large—underground or otherwise—with the passage of time.</p>
<p>Lacking relevance to current trends isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but the lack of focus and force on <i>Volume X</i>, the unkillable band’s unsatisfying tenth full-length, doesn't help their cause. One of Trans Am’s stocks in trade, new-wave pastiche, is represented in a halfhearted fashion this time around. New-wave means a lot of things to a lot of people, but in Trans Am’s case, that meaning has always been narrow and rigid: synth-pop of the icy, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kratfwerk</a>-ian extraction. Aptly, “Night Shift” is a spacious, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a>-esque instrumental that also dips slightly into pinging krautrock; if placed against wallpaper, you would only notice the wallpaper. The band is far more successful on “I’ll Never”, an homage to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11363-dazzle-ships/""><i>Dazzle Ships</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3151-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark/"">OMD</a>, albeit with hints of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>. With reverb-and-vocoder-chilled vocals intoning, “Come a little bit closer/ For the very last time”, the song is a 1980s prom anthem crooned by the nerdy kid who hasn't found transcendence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Trans Am doesn't maintain that tender alchemy between corniness and poignancy. Singer/multi-instrumentlist Phil Manley has lately been busy with his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17910-life-coach-alphawaves/"">Life Coach</a> side project, which has veered toward the more metallic end of Trans Am’s spectrum, and that facet gets indulged on a pair of <i>Volume X</i>’s gravest missteps. “Anthropocene” sounds as if Uriah Heep had pioneered the use of synths—instead of stodgy old organs—in the pursuit of fantastic, early 70s proto-metal. Understandably, the result is incomprehensible, a mess of mixed signifiers that sounds like Spinal Tap trapped in an Atari. If that idea had been developed further, it could have been amazing in the hands of Trans Am; instead, “Anthropocene” is answered by “Backlash”, a possible shout-out to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"">Metallica</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPh_9sRJycI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Whiplash”</a> that jabs jokey thrash into mock-industrial mechanization.</p>
<p>A handful of tracks on <i>Volume X</i> are decent placeholders that do nothing to expand or appreciably reinforce the band’s aesthetic, but “Ice Fortress” stands out to represent everything Trans Am does right, as propulsive, arpeggiated synth chords bounce gracefully off one another while swells of bass-like waveforms rise and fall menacingly. The mood is familiar yet alien—Trans Am’s sweet spot, when it’s able to find it these days. The song’s stoned motorik pulse owes as much to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VouHPeO4Gls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“On the Run”</a> as it does any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a> track from the same era. Straddling the fence between the stadium and the obscure is where Trans Am sits proudest, and that alternate-history vision of pop is what makes “Ice Fortress” so vital—and the rest of the album limp by comparison.</p>
<p>With <i>Volume X</i>, Trans Am have made it clear that they have as many chops as ever. They shouldn’t go away, nor should anyone want them to. But when they’ve persevered for so long, where so many bands of their '90s post-rock peer group haven’t, maybe a little survivor’s guilt would be a positive thing. Anything to get them making urgent, absurd, ambitious records again.</p></div>"|19298.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19298-trans-am-volume-x/|5.0|Jason Heller

The band's music is “subtlety-free,” according to their Facebook, and their third, most fully realized record begins with a raucous vocal asking, “Hey you indie rockers/ Is everybody in?”, less a snarky call-out and more of a call to arms. They're literally asking if everyone’s in the room so they can begin.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Pitchfork’s Ian Cohen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16814-mad-men/"" target=""_blank"">described</a> Herzog’s sound as “loud fuzz and slightly less loud fuzz”, and it's easy to expect that template resembling yet another <i>pro forma</i> garage band indistinguishable from its peers. But <i>Boys</i> is defined by how much fun it is to listen to, dense with warring guitars and lurching with a sloppy grace. On ""Mad Men"", they follow the snappy line “I used to write, but money’s made in publishing” with an insanely catchy whistling melody; ""Bicycle Girls"" is exuberantly out of control”, resembling a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29998-fidlar/"">FIDLAR</a> song with lyrics that don’t make you feel stupid when you listen hard. (Surprisingly, the song is a tender ode to a single mother.) At one point on the album, they sing, “What’s the point of writing songs if nobody ever wants to sing along”, and <i>Boys </i>is indeed hook-heavy, the vocals often double-tracked by the similar-sounding Nick Tolar and Dave McHenry.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It would be tiring if Herzog played loud and fast all the time, but luckily the band's got a few curveballs in their repertoire. “Teenage Metalhead” rewrites Weezer’s “In the Garage” with the assumption that the kids eventually got out of the garage and learned to dance (or, at least, sway), detailing a road trip to Cleveland and buying weed from an Englishman “with a crooked tooth and a yellow van” before seeing the Black Sabbath exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. “Saint Scrapyard” baits you into thinking it’s gone quiet with a few brushes of fluttering drums, before kicking back into a shared scream.  </span></p>
<p><i>Boys </i><span>is obsessed with interior states and vagaries of youth, singing about drunken nights that get broken up by the cops (“Oh No”), jokes from the sixth grade that are still funny (“It’s Hard Getting Old”), former rivalries that mellow out with time and maturation (“You Are Not the Villain”). You can’t deny the album’s focus on the titular male persuasion, not when they’re singing lines like “I write songs for boys/ ‘Cause I’m one of them” and “This is a theme for all the boys/ Playing guitars and making noise.”</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-93fa4d87-fb32-b492-f85f-6fb85ea1f828""><span>And there’s something endearingly juvenile about openly referring to oneself as a “boy”—but it's also possible to become excessively aggravated by consuming yet another piece of media that revels in having XY chromosomes. Also, there’s a very fine line between commenting on and complaining about one’s existence, and this album sometimes wears a little thin with its defeatism. Tolar sings a lyric as self-aware and wry as “Right now some things are fucked up for me/ But I won't complain ‘cause it's boring”, and then follows it up with a whine about having to go to a show by himself because all his friends stayed home. But Herzog are talking about themselves, and the boys of their lives; if you’re inclined to listen, you might find there’s a lot to recognize. </span></span></p></div>"|19296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19296-herzog-boys/|7.2|Jeremy Gordon

The Pains' still-stellar <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12644-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"">self-titled debut</a> and 2011's Flood-helmed, fully Corgan-ized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15270-belong/""><i>Belong</i></a> put precious little distance between Berman's heart and his sleeve: these were head-spinning, chest-swelling records, drunk on romance, dizzy with possibility. <i>Abandon</i> doesn't completely ditch the heart-bursting intensity that powered the Pains' previous work, but it's no longer its driving force. Once a starry-eyed daydreamer pitching woo at anybody in earshot, Berman now sounds like a guy who's seen his share of heartbreak, and is looking to reconcile his youthful idealism with the complexities and complications of post-adolescent coupling.</p>
<p>For some, <i>Belong's</i> buzzsawing guitars and brazenly romantic lyrics were all just a bit <i>much</i>. Still, given the leap between the debut's mid-fi melodrama and <i>Belong's</i> amplified alt-rock ambitions, it seemed only natural that Berman might take the Pains into bigger, more bombastic places on his new record—and that notion dissolves just a few seconds into ""Art Smock"", <i>Abandon's</i> delicate, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1596-felt"">Felt</a>-referencing opener. From the very first notes, <i>Abandon</i> is subtler, more graceful and, sure, more ""mature"" than any Pains record before it. The spindly, hushed ""Smock"" might just be the single most delicate song in the Pains catalog, but more tellingly, it's easily the most nostalgic as well, a sweet-and-sour remembrance of a relationship-that-wasn't. So many of Berman's songs seem to take place in the immediate present: whatever's being felt, it's being felt right then and now, and the vibe of ""all we have is this moment"" gives his best songs their crackling urgency. Up against those early records, ""Smock"" feels more reflective, more wistful. It's a look at the present through the lens of the past, in which Berman allows lived-in experience step in and take over for all that untempered passion.<br/><br/>This fine-tuning of Berman's emotional outpouring—more pragmatic, less excitable—carries throughout much of <i>Abandon</i>. ""Tell me that we're still so young,"" Berman sighs atop the high-test twee of ""Beautiful You"", before adding, ""But you’re wrong, so wrong."" On ""Until the Sun Explodes"", Berman's in a hospital room, at the bedside of his betrothed, making big promises. This is hardly Berman's first song about unwavering devotion, but with its implication of mutual addiction and somewhat startling reference to ""funeral clothes"", it's probably his most complicated. As he sings on bouncy lead single ""Simple and Sure,"" Berman wants something that just feels ""absolutely right."" But that's the ideal, not necessarily the reality; sometimes, things get messy, and you wind up gurney-side, looking on helplessly as the object of your affection breathes through a tube. These wrinkles—anxious memories, telling recollections, none-too-idyllic scenes from the past—are all over <i>Abandon</i>. Berman's certainly turned in sweeter, more rousing sets, but he's never written anything that feels quite so true to life.<br/><br/>In the wake of <i>Belong</i>, Pains underwent a fairly seismic personnel shift: several original members—singer/keyboardist Peggy Wang, guitarist Chris Hochheim and bassist Alex Naidus —have either left the band or taken diminished roles, leaving just the core lineup of Berman and drummer Kurt Feldman. On <i>Abandon</i>, the pair are joined by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/636-beirut/"">Beirut</a>'s Kelly Pratt and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5171-a-sunny-day-in-glasgow/"">A Sunny Day in Glasgow</a> singer Jen Goma; when she's not matching Berman harmony-for-harmony, Goma—like Wang before her—takes the lead on several of these tracks. Goma's sweet yet knowing tone makes a good foil for Berman's delicate heart-to-hearts, as her spry turn on the buoyant ""Kelly"" is maybe <i>Abandon</i>'s finest moment, its sputtering drumbeat at one point all but backing up just to make sure it doesn't miss anything she's saying.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Abandon's</i> the fizziest Pains record yet. Gone are the plumes of distortion, and in their place there's a crisp, effervescent gallop, splitting its time between dreamy balladry and spotless indie-pop. Granted, it's not all perfect: the sun-dappled insurance-commercial chug of the too-rousing-by-half ""Coral and Gold"" gets smothered by its own bombast, while elsewhere, Pratt's lighter touches fade gently into the background. But there's a newfound patience to just about everything else here, a deliberate, well-heeled sound that sits well with Berman's more ruminative lyrical turns.<br/><br/>On first contact, <i>Abandon</i> can come across as muted and brittle, lacking the laid-bare emotional charge that carried its predecessors. Berman's in fine voice (faux-British accent and all) throughout <i>Abandon</i>, and—the overblown ""Coral and Gold"" aside—these melodies are sturdy, even regal. But it's certainly a less thrilling record than what came before it, more refinement than reinvention, more likely to gather its thoughts than spill them out to anyone within earshot. the fact that Berman didn't try to outdo the grandiose <i>Belong</i> is a good thing, but <i>Abandon</i> can't help but come across as a transitional record, the first entrant in the Pains' ""mature"" period, with the promise of more to come.</p>
<p>Berman's called <i>Abandon</i> the most personal Pains record to date, and there's no reason to doubt him: he's applying the lessons of his own life to this music, all the tiny triumphs and harrowing heartbreaks that come from being young and in love. So as good as <i>Abandon</i> is, one can't help but think the more he goes through, the richer and more resonant his music will become. ""He’d come to my garret, and we’d make something like love,"" Goma recalls halfway through the bustling ""Life After Life"". Still, she says, ""The flowers he gave me have wilted/ But I keep them, like I keep him."" Some love lasts forever; most dries up like tulips in a vase—but with every heartbreak comes a well-earned lesson, a souvenir to keep until the next one comes along. On <i>Abandon</i>, an increasingly wizened Berman seems to've picked up plenty.</p></div>"|19335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19335-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart-days-of-abandon/|7.5|Paul Thompson

There have been exultant harmonies and disembodied howls, chamber music interludes and industrial noise ruptures, gilded acoustic fantasies and barbaric electric marches. From the start, Agalloch created new ways to work these disparate elements into complicated prog-rock forms—song suites, lengthy tracks, uninterrupted albums—while maintaining momentum. More than the metaphysical gaze of their lyrics or the relative mystery of their music, Agalloch has thrived on that rarified mutualism of immediacy and intricacy. After four largely flawless albums, that combination has made them a guiding creative light of American metal.</p>
<p>But Agalloch offered the infrequent human blunder with 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16928-faustian-echoes-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Faustian Echoes</i></a>, a one-track, 22-minute EP. The band spliced <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109781/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">samples of the Goethe play</a> into a stepwise, rote rise-and-fall into loudness. The result was spirited, sure, but for Agalloch, it felt basic and empty, a studio-experiment stopgap that didn’t meet the enormous expectations set by the popular breakthrough <i>Marrow of the Spirit</i>. It upheld only one end of the Agalloch bargain. In retrospect, it’s best to consider <i>Faustian Echoes</i> <a href=""http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/fl/Agalloch-Interview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a test run for legendary metal producer Billy Anderson</a>, who’d been mixing the band’s onstage sets since 2010 but had never before recorded them in the studio. Anderson returns for <i>The Serpent &amp; the Sphere</i>, the fifth Agalloch album. It proves that proves the folly of <i>Faustian Echoes </i>was worthwhile: <i>The Serpent &amp; the Sphere</i> not only delivers the depth and development that have become synonymous with Agalloch but, across nine wonderfully imagined and vividly realized tracks, amplifies those qualities by often turning the amplifiers themselves down.</p>
<p><i>The Serpent &amp; the Sphere</i> includes some charged crescendos, laser-sharp leads and two of Agalloch’s most direct rock ’n’ roll tracks ever. But its tone is relatively muted, as though leader John Haughm’s grand lyrical reflections on death and cosmic rebirth cast a temperate shade across the music itself. Three of these pieces are pensive, classical guitar miniatures, written and performed by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MuskOxOfficial"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ontario musician Nathanaël Larochette</a> and supported only by faint whispers of drones and noise. “Plateau of the Ages”, the 13-minute monster that precedes the fingerpicked closer, is an instrumental beauty, as radiant as the best work of Mono and triumphant as the heavy metal royalty its piercing twin guitars suggest.</p>
<p>But it's the album's opener, “Birth and Death of the Pillars of Creation”, that immediately and brilliantly casts the record’s somber, reflective mood. For 10 minutes, Agalloch dances at the edge of eruption, using the promise of a climax as only a temptation. The quartet moves from meditative electric guitar murmur to earth-quaking drums, pounding against a pillow of keyboards and harmonies. In the past, Agalloch has launched from such lurking moments into black metal sprees. Rather than cash in, they use that move as a feint three times here, arriving always in a sort of readymade post-rock aurora. “By way of light across a vast millennia, I can behold this grandeur at its infancy,” Haughm whispers at one point, his words and careful voice perfectly capturing the nebulousness of both the introduction and album that follow.</p>
<p>These quiet retreats reappear throughout <i>The Serpent &amp; the Sphere</i>—not only during the classical guitar comedowns but during the proper rock numbers, too. “Vales Beyond Dimension”, for instance, dips into quick, placid valleys between peaks of volume, with drums receding into a trot and guitars drifting into a slow gaze; the quiet, deliberate moments add power to the louder sections and songs<i> </i>through sheer relativity.</p>
<p>Agalloch’s expert momentum have always depended on an aptitude with dynamics, and on <i>The Serpent &amp; the Sphere</i>, they've made it a science of patience and timing. After that slow-motion opener and a subsequent instrumental, “The Astral Dialogue” springs ahead with a mid-tempo, bass-heavy wallop, emptying without warning into one of the album’s few belligerent blast-beat blitzes. Agalloch maintain that seesaw effect, baiting difficult transitions with the eager feeling one gets while peering around a bend, trying to anticipate what’s coming next.</p>
<p>“Celestial Effigy”, meanwhile, ripples through a litany of ideas and influences, built into one uninterrupted, seven-minute flow. Haughm's guitars, along with and the versatile, brilliant playing of Don Anderson, dance in ornate rituals, flickering notes stabbing at distended riffs and pristine tones countering sheets of distortion. At once, there’s metal and prog, along with blues-rock and a little pop, too. You can practically envision drummer Aesop Dekker and bassist Jason William Walton nodding at each other through the song’s counterintuitive rhythmic shifts; at one point, the bass sits still, embodying a cold doom stare, while the drums sprint ahead, agile and unapologetic. That conflict epitomizes the separate sources of tension—quiet and loud, slow and fast, acoustic and <i>The Serpent &amp; the Sphere</i>, black and folk metal, hard rock and soft comedowns—that allows Agalloch to be at once immediate <i>and</i> intricate. Even in these songs’ most placid passages, the band behind them never sits still.</p>
<p><i>The Serpent &amp; the Sphere</i> might disappoint fans of Agalloch’s more seething output. This is the band’s gentlest and most lucid album to date, and the musical knots that characterized <i>Marrow of the Spirit</i>’s long tracks have been pulled apart like strands of yarn. But Agalloch have never aimed for simply being brutal or destructive. Instead, their sense of shock has stemmed from their ability to surprise with unexpected wormholes and complementary contrasts, to build rather than break. In that respect, <i>The Serpent &amp; The Sphere</i> is their most refined and generous album to date, an elegant trip to unexpected ends, as Agalloch continue to find new ways to reassemble and reorder their long-standing tricks. They're as singular and instantly identifiable as they were on <i>Pale Folklore</i>, but <i>The Serpent &amp; the Sphere</i> reveals a familiar Agalloch that you’ve never quite heard—evermore patient, risky and, mostly, free of fault.</p></div>"|19269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19269-agalloch-the-serpent-the-sphere/|8.3|Grayson Haver Currin

In his solo work, nearly every line is a result of his desire to get a laugh, and <i>FreeBase</i>, his recently released free EP, allows 2 Chainz to stay in character without overstretching his shtick.  <br/><br/><i>FreeBase</i> remains as sonically adventurous as 2 Chainz’s previous two albums. Mike Will Made It’s lumbering stomp on “Wuda Cuda Shuda” and Young Chop’s eerie speedboat-chase music on “They Know” demonstrate why they have been go to producers of the last few years. The tape's padded out with samples from Richard Pryor and the absurdist comedy <i>Step</i> <i>Brothers</i>, providing a framework that makes the EP more than a pack of leftover tracks from an old recording session. <br/> <br/>On repeated listens, 2 Chainz’s punchline-focused style turns initial smirks into outright laughter. His sense of humor is most potent when riffing on familiar rap tropes, but it can be hard to stomach when he turns to pure misogyny on tracks like “Flexin on My Baby Mama”.  Regardless, <i>FreeBase</i> has its genuinely funny moments, such as when 2 Chainz, who has worked with everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a> to Lil Boosie, states “I’ve done a song with everybody from Jermaine Dupri down to Papoose,” which is at the least an interesting selection of artists to namedrop. <br/><br/>2 Chainz can appear on a song with any rapper or pop star, but he also wants to throw his weight around in the area of modern rap that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a> namechecks on “Crib in My Closet”: fashion. ""Crib in My Closet"" sounds like a 2000-era Big Tymers boastful track where 2 Chainz, A$AP Rocky, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a> fight for the “Best Dressed” crown, with Rocky delivering the knockout punch by name-dropping the Met Ball and Anna Wintour. It should be said, though, that 2 Chainz's obsession with fashion also provides the best intentionally ironic line, as he yells “I don’t respect my elders,” willfully ignoring that, in terms of age, he's the oldest rapper to appear on the EP. 2 Chainz been rapping for over a decade, but now his music sounds like he’s just entertaining himself during late night recording sessions and (correctly) assuming his audience is along for the ride.</p></div>"|19361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19361-2-chainz-freebase-ep/|7.2|David Turner
