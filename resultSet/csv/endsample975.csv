    decade of eluding non-metal ears, Xasthur has stepped outside the
    extreme music tinderbox for his bone-rattling fifth album, <em>Subliminal Genocide</em>.
    Comprised solely of Scott Conner, aka Malefic, Xasthur's U.S. black metal first received crossover attention for
    contributions to Sunn 0)))'s <em>Black One</em>: Malefic's coffined presence,
    along with vocal work by fellow Twilight traveler Leviathan (aka
    Wrest), is a huge part of what catapulted that album to acclaim.</p><p>
    Well, that was then. Now, jumping Southern
    Lord's ship, he's signed to Los Angeles-based, Aaron Turner-run Hydra
    Head, who also picked up the excellent one-man Swedish black metal
    band, Heresi. But he's hardly slowed down
    to smell the hemlock: He already promises a newer, stronger Hydra Head
    album, <em>Defective Epitaph</em>, in 2007 and Battle Kommand's reissuing 2001's <em>A Gate Through Bloodstained Mirrors</em>,
    Moribund's putting out a three-song eponymous Xasthur mini CD (reportedly
    his last music for the label), and there are splits with Striborg,
    etc., in the works.</p><p>
    No matter how small the relocation to Hydra Head may seem, <em>Subliminal Genocide</em>'s
    already popping up in record store bins Bestial Onslaught, Total
    Holocaust, and the mighty Moribund Cult couldn't always reach. Plus,
    the frequency tweak's bigger than one dude: Xasthur's appearance on a
    label not generally known for releasing black metal, speaks volumes
    about recent overlaps and reconfigurations that go far
    beyond whatever folks term ""hipster metal."" For instance: The
    legitimately legendary Norwegian black metal group Immortal have a new
    lineup and are scheduled to play a couple summer gigs in L.A. and New
    York. Seriously, <em>that</em> Immortal. <br/>
</p><p>
    Something to keep in mind and possibly check at the door is your
    perception of black metal, which may be skewed by the
    corpsepaint and burnt churches documented in Michael Moynihan's
    Varg-centric book, <em>Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground</em>.
    Yes, it's certainly a fun read, but going on Moynihan's not entirely
    accurate history alone is akin to consecrating Michael Azerrad's <em>Our Band Could Be Your Life</em>
    as the bona fide Bible of America's ""indie underground,"" circa
    1981-1991, though he barely mentions...Bad Brains, Pixies, Dead Kennedys,
    Swans, et al.
    </p>
<p>
    Even wizened souls who've memorized buzzing guitar
    tabs and ballsy ""Kathaarian Life Code"" drum fills might be surprised by
    what's afoot in the US of A-- this isn't grandma's Norwegian/European
    black metal. Malefic owes a topical aesthetic resemblance to Burzum or
    Graveland, but compressed into beautiful bedroom recordings, and sans the
    neo-nazism. Okay, that's the unsavory side of certain black metal
    brambles: Political/personal beliefs can get scary (and cartoonish)
    fast. Like other popular one-man U.S. black metal musicians, though, Malefic
    seems more about a general gloom-and-doom Nietszche trip.
    </p>
<p>
    Malefic's always been a great producer, a master of bleak ambiance. On the great 2002 album, <em>Nocturnal Poisoning</em>, he suffocated sound, submerging each detail in a grey haze. <em>Subliminal Genocide</em>
    is even more brutally piercing-- its corners are sharp, shrieking,
    petulant, and dense. Consider it the sonic equivalent of a beautiful case of seasonal
    affective disorder during a locust invasion (""it's raining murder!"").
    To create that patented quicksand cocoon, he uses sundry effects and
    pedals, cello, guitar (classical acoustic and electric) and bass,
    keyboards, an army of drum machines, and some mics to capture his
    brilliant howl. There's a
    lot of music here (61 minutes, to be almost exact) and
    Malefic wisely wanted it to be heard as a whole-- divided into sections
    the cumulative effect's wasted.
    </p>
<p>
    It opens with ""Disharmonic
    Convergence"", a hushed chamber piece-- rolling, drunken boat keys that
    dissolves into the 13-minute ""Prison Of Mirrors"", a showcase for
    Malefic's quintessential layering of muddy guitars, gothy arpeggios,
    amazing death-breath vocals, and swooping drum machines under a funeral
    moon. Vocally, Malefic approximates a
    possessed raven tracking a blaze in the sky with Edger Allan Poe
    (should be noted: his voice is <em>always</em> dead on).
    </p>
<p>
    Malefic
    knows nuance, introducing briefer ambient bits like ""Pyramid of Skulls""
    to bridge the denser tracks. Or, a few longer compositions like ""Arcane and Misanthropic Projection"" drift through a downcast mild beauty
    complete with expressive guitar soloing before promptly exploding.
    ""Malice Hidden in Surrealism""'s a waning guitar exeunt that slowly
    distorts into a creeping death stew that could've come out of New
    Zealand in the early 90s. And the somber strums of
    ""Loss and Inner Distortion"" has a few pagan folk qualities. Three cheers for variation, but Xasthur's always
    sounded best clogging up, possessing, and devouring space: see ""Beauty
    Is Only Razor Deep""-- drums become gentle directive lulls into a flanged
    choir of fallen angels (housed in a salt-cast beehive).
    </p>
<p>
    Caveat: If <em>Subliminal Genocide</em>'s
    your first black metal album, you might find it a bit repetitious. It's
    not. Listen closely. A singular moth-bitten patterns emerges--
    eventually even the roughest seasickness gains an essential momentum.
    Really, as days shorten, cool breezes drift down from the north, and
    leaves head south, you'll be hard pressed to find a chillier, more
    blasted fall-to-Revelations transition.

    Robyn Hitchcock has such a
    reputation for being a weirdo on record that it's startling when he offers a
    moment of heartfelt clarity. You get a few of these on <em>Olé! Tarantula</em>,
    scattered about the familiar rubble of bugs, libido, and geometry. Like the
    reminder that ""There's nothing wrong with failure/ Everybody does it""
    in ""The Authority Box"", or the assertion that ""Music is the
    antidote to a world of pain and sorrow"" on ""Museum of Sex"".
    Listening to this record you get the feeling that Hitchcock believes that
    second one to his very soul.</p><p>
<em>Olé! Tarantula</em> doesn't even think about breaking
    new ground, but it does present Hitchcock as a guy comfortable with his
    strangeness. The surrealism feels as natural as it ever did with the Soft Boys
    or in his <em>Fegmania!/Element of Light</em> heyday. But instead of the urgency
    of those old records, here we get assured confidence. In a time when everybody
    seems to be making a credible comeback, it would be easy for a guy like
    Hitchcock to overreach; instead, he balances the bizarrely profane (""Fuck
    me, baby/ I'm a trolley bus"") and the reverent, as on the touching ode to
    late New York Dolls bassist Arthur Kane that closes the album.</p><p>
    Part of this confidence might stem from the backing
    band. Scott McCaughey, Peter Buck, and Bill Rieflin are the Venus 3, and their
    name seems to be an oblique reference to the Minus 5, of which all three are
    members. Having these guys behind him gives Hitchcock plenty of room to move,
    and the result is a loose, eclectic album. The record opens with a blast
    of stomping rock on ""Adventure Rocket Ship"", which casts the Venus 3
    as a junior Soft Boys, nods to ""Arnold Layne"", proudly brandishes the
    word ""hermaphrodite,"" and generally gets things off to a smashing
    start. (Actual Soft Boy Morris Windsor is on many of these songs helping
    McCaughey with the backing harmonies.)
    </p>
<p>
    ""Belltown Ramble"", with McCaughey's piano
    wandering over Rieflin's muted drums, feels similar to the first section of
    Pink Floyd's ""Pow R Toc H"". Hitchcock gets into this musical
    environment and relates a stroll through one's hometown that happens to include
    encounters with Tamerlane and an Uzbek warlord. While its title promises a
    nightmare freakout, ""Red Locust Frenzy"" is even gentler,
    and the verses about holding off demons aren't as literal as Hitchcock might
    otherwise make them.
    </p>
<p>
    The surreal approach doesn't work across the board. The
    title track, for instance, contains plenty of deliciously disturbing imagery of
    tarantulas gathering underground between peels of harmonica, but it also finds
    Hitchcock getting too weird for his own good. ""I feel like a three-legged
    chinchilla,"" he sings, a feeling I doubt anyone can identify with,
    three-legged chinchillas aside. Still, his knack for making the odd not just
    palatable for a broad audience but downright meaningful is sharper than ever. <em>Olé!
    Tarantula</em> isn't his best solo record, but it's in the top tier, and after
    all these years that's certainly something.

The title track opens the album, and skips merrily by on gliding distortion and ringing Cure-like single notes while giving singer/guitarist Jeremy Bolen the space in the verse to carry the track. He does so somewhat awkwardly, but ably, with more than a little Robert Smith-like wavering in his otherwise everyman voice. ""Harness"" also bursts with tiny details, like the whipcrack of a drum pad or the groaning strings underneath the spritely organ. It's a little aurally crowded for a breezy rock single, but for the most part, it works.</p><p>
    Bolen's voice still doesn't always mesh with the music, but it's an improvement on the hoarse whispering from the first album. But the band is the star here: The prettier moments are far prettier, like the glistening reverb of ""Mansioned"", and more details lurk underneath what sounds like typical indie jangle. A skittering electronic beat morphs into handclaps in ""Water Plains in Snow""; jittery punk-funk guitars recede for a sunny Stereolab nod in the middle of ""Blankets like Beavers""; a new-wave synth pops up in ""We've Got to Keep Running""; and whimsical plucks of violin subtly boost an innocuous pre-chorus in ""I Need a Friend With a Boat"", one of the album's most spacious and successful tracks. There's nothing as immediate as the debut's best tracks, but the hooks are there if you dig for them-- witness the subtle harmonies of the breakdown in ""We've Got to Keep Running"". This band just keeps getting sharper, and rarely hold anything back. This is pop for the detail-hungry.</p><p>
    Chalk it up to the comedown from the excitement of a debut record, but where before it sounded as if this band could pull off anything, now it sounds as if they feel like they have to pull off everything. Even the buffet table gets old, and while there are golden moments, there's yet to be a song where the styles that CUCU blitz through serve the song instead of vice versa. (Or at least, a fast song-- ""Mansioned"" and the closing ""Trophies for Hire"" seem to be the album's centerpieces.) <em>Harness</em> doesn't deliver many surprises or follow through on the promise of the debut; it simply refines the sounds they explored and digs its heels in a little deeper. We used to praise bands for this kind of slow, assured growth. There's going to be a moment, though-- if it hasn't come already-- where Chin Up Chin Up will outgrow the local hero tag and need to live up to expectation.</p></div>"|9493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9493-this-harness-cant-ride-anything/|7.3|Jason Crock

It's expected: In this decade, especially in this country-- and <i>especially</i> with a     president that treats religion like a popular mandate to run amuck-- it's hard     to write seriously about Christian devotion in a rock-and-folk context without     being seen as a white religious zealot on a proselytizer's stump. That's     especially true if, as with Edwards, one shares the last name of the Massachusetts minister     who, in 1734, fueled The Great Awakening by inventing modern revivalism.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But Edwards is a songwriter on a completely different tip.     He has little but his Christian faith and the confidence of his convictions and     their concomitant questions to guide him. He's not a minister, and he's     neither aiming from nor for the Heartland. <i>Mosaic</i>,     the third proper album from Wovenhand and the first since the dissolution of 16     Horsepower, makes that very clear: Though most of the songs here are based in archetypical     Americana     banjo, acoustic guitar and massive church organ swells, Edwards borrows heavily     from European Christianity for source material and on European tradition for instrumentation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""Swedish Purse"", an ode to Edwards' wife and God, lifts its     melody from a medieval hymn. ""Dirty Blue"" plays primarily on violin, acoustic     guitar, and percussion, but its staggered time signature and chiseled staccato     violin lines speak more to Balkan than American folk. That song's heavy     reliance on symbolism-- ""the book of numbers,"" amber rings, and the bells of Leuven, Belgium-- runs counter to evangelical Christianity's     literalist dogma. The album's most exquisite moment, ""Truly Golden"", was even written     by Edwards' Belgian guitarist, Peter Van Laerhoven. It seems Edwards-- who has     recorded with Daniel Smith in the past-- has found a transcontinental network     devoted to the questions of faith that permeate his songwriting, and-- by now--     its ""Americana     heartland"" only on the most fundamental level.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As such, <i>Mosaic </i>rarely     sounds or reads like a pilgrim meditation of faith: ""Slota Prow"" buries     Edwards' voice in an industrial din, an indecisive violin line-- split     somewhere between sprightly and doleful-- slicing through his imprecations.     It's more Pyschic TV than Sun Records, spirituality literally and     metaphorically marred by supreme secular woe via dissonance. Such erudite     extroversion doubles when Edwards delivers the song's second verse in his     invented language and segues seamlessly into ""Full Armour"", an extended     metaphor for the divine protection Edwards feels in his God. These images are     not an ""Old Rugged Cross"" redux.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">They are offered as Edwards': His words are     his psalms, open to empathy, not instruction. Pedagogy only appears on ""Twig"": ""Eternal     creator of the world/ Who rules the day/ Who rules the night,"" Edwards intones.     His voice echoes as though sung from the basilica of Milan Cathedral, the     spiritual domain of Saint Ambrose, the fourth century bishop that wrote them.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But Edwards' increasing distance from the American mantle     that made 16 Horsepower so mighty and resilient does leave something to be     desired: Songs like Horsepower's ""Blessed Persistence"" showcased his ability to     work within an American primitive framework raised by songwriters like Johnny     Cash, a troubleman grappling with hell and heaven. Very little on <i>Mosaic</i> pushes that zone of familiarity     and immediacy into new contexts, choosing instead to reroute those questions     through different musical molds and associations. But Edwards' heart and soul     are still here, questioning, wondering and waiting, ""<i>New Morning</i> on the stereo…inside the home [where] the folk pine     grow.""</p></div>"|9453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9453-mosaic/|6.8|Grayson Currin

But if you're more interested in hearing ancient mountain and Delta traditions synthesized-- scratched up, muddied, and re-imagined for an America more reliant on machines than the grace of God-- curl up with Califone's <em>Roots and Crowns</em>, the Chicago collective's staggering homage to starts and finishes, computers and cornfields, dirty feet and throbbing foreheads.</p><p>
<em>Roots and Crowns</em> is Califone's most sophisticated record to date, a natural-- if lighter-- extension of 2004's <em>Heron King Blues</em>, and a coherent aesthetic declaration (which is even more of a triumph considering it was recorded in chunks with new gear, after frontman Tim Rutili packed up for California and the band's instruments were raided during their last tour). This is Califone's climax: <em>Roots and Crowns</em> blurs all lines between the organic and the synthesized, and is as much a product of the gut as the mind, with each perfectly placed skronk-and-twitter hitting its intellectual and emotional targets.</p><p>
    Over the course of eight full-lengths, Califone have proven their prowess for improvisational out-jazz and melodic scrap-folk in equal measure-- <em>Roots and Crowns</em> sees both impulses at play, over some of the band's best-written songs. Longtime engineer (and former Red Red Meat member, and part-time Califone percussionist) Brian Deck orchestrates the loops and squeaks, piecing distinct, synthesized bits into cohesive pictures, and ensuring that the end result still sounds like something your dog dug up in the backyard and spit out, slobber-slicked and gummed, on your front doormat.
    </p><p>
    Lyrically, Rutili favors tiny, imagistic vignettes over narrative arcs, and these songs read more like prose poems than stories-- which, given the hyper-fragmented sound-collage of Califone's instrumentation, makes a certain kind of sense.  In addictive opener ""Pink and Sour"", Rutilli talks-- twice-- about losing his language over rollicking tribal drums and slide guitar (""Along your skin/ Lost my language,"" ""Cotton in the calm along your side/ Lost my language""), and his bandmates compensate in full, slipping in vivid percussive flourishes that speak remarkably well in his absence. On the whimsical ""Spiders House"", fellow Chicagoans Bitter Tears lend brassy toots, muted trumpet and trombone sighing, resigned and tired, while Rutili's rusty pipes spew abstract laments: ""After the quiet bleeds peel and age familiar/ Peace in the pain."" ""The Orchids"", lifted from former-Throbbing Gristle outfit Psychic TV, is, according to Rutili, the record's inspiration, and is beautifully rendered here-- Rutili' s voice is cottony and vaguely-love-struck, while wisps of harmonica weave in and out of his coos. 
    </p>
<p>
    Califone have always been stupidly underappreciated, and the further we stumble into the 21st century, the more this music starts to feel both familiar and necessary: <em>Roots and Crowns</em> is bluesy and soulful without reverting to revivalist schtick, and experimental without relying on blind cut-and-pasting. It is old and new, dirty and clean, alienating and accessible, sweet and ugly, organic and industrial, doting and vicious. It is one of the most quintessentially American records imaginable.

    While other forward-looking indie hip-hop labels like Rawkus
    and Def Jux have declined or folded over the last decade, Peanut Butter Wolf's
    Stones Throw remains vital. Survival isn't an easy task for any tiny label
    nowadays, but to achieve such fan loyalty and artistic consistency in the
    notoriously fickle universe of rap is particularly notable. To celebrate the
    accomplishment, Wolf gathered his roster and compiled this 19-song mix CD/live
    DVD, released in association with Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. While the
    irreverent cartoon franchise played a large role on their first foray into
    hip-hop-- mixing up last year's <em>Dangerdoom</em>
    album with skits featuring ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" among other animated
    anomalies-- their involvement here is on the periphery. Still, it's an inspired
    form of brand extension on both sides-- two boundary-bursting entities obsessed
    over by nerds and stoners alike.</p><p>
    Instead of taking advantage of this synergistic
    moment to piece together a hits CD, Wolf elicits new compositions from
    his crew, including multiple appearances from J Dilla, Oh No, and the spiritual
    mastermind of the Stones Throw aesthetic, Madlib (under multiple guises, of
    course). So while B-list throwers and top-heavy sequencing bring the mix's Parliament
    3000 vibe down a bit, <em>Chrome Children</em>
    is an accurate summary of a singular label. It's all here-- the untouchable
    beats, mediocre braggadocio raps, brilliant rediscovered nuggets, so-so hippie r&amp;b, and psych freak-outs worthy of Sun Ra.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    With three productions and one verse, the late Dilla's
    shadow looms large over <em>Chrome Children</em>.
    On ""Clap Your Hands"", he's in minimalist-bounce mode, laying down
    an ominous snare snap for Detroit MC Guilty Simpson to stomp all over. The
    little known Simpson follows his two outstanding spots on the recent
    posthumous Dilla disc <em>The Shining</em>
    with yet another standout performance, his straightforward delivery fitting
    perfectly inside the producer's oozing supersonics. Equally great is the oddball
    funk of ""Nothing Like This"", featuring stilted, robotic vocals
    professing unrequited love. Twisted yet still bumping, it comes off like a
    genuine hip-hop ode filtered through Devo. Dilla's work on the album professes
    not only to his palpable heart, but his staggering range as well. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Elsewhere, Madlib continues to plunder his endless well of
    woozy, sample-based brilliance with MF Doom on ""Monkey Suite"", a slithering
    preview of the upcoming Madvillain LP. A couple of tracks later, he puts on his
    alien party hat for ""All I Know"", but the sticky drums are wasted by
    subpar stoner MC MED, who just sounds creepy when he talks about having his
    ""whole dick in her throat."" Stones Throw is sometimes tripped-up when
    it steps out of its haze-hop comfort zone, a fact proven by lackluster tracks
    from psych-meister Koushik and too-smooth crooner Aloe Blacc. Of the lesser
    known acts, late-blooming West Coast rhymer Roc C rips hardest with his huffing
    flow on the sweet soul-ing, Oh No-produced ""Movin'"".
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    One of Stone Throw's consistently spectacular reissue
    imprints, So Cal, is represented by the Sly Stone-style 1970s gem ""Third
    Rock"" by Pure Essence (a song Rjd2 fans will recognize from a sample from <em>Since We Last Spoke</em>'s ""Clean
    Living""). <em>Chrome</em> would have
    benefited from more stellar throwbacks like this from the likes of the Kashmere
    Stage Band and the Ebony Rhythm Band, both recently rediscovered largely thanks
    to Stones Throw sister label Now-Again. In an interview on <em>Chrome</em>'s disappointingly dull DVD-- largely devoted to a showcase
    from this year's SXSW festival-- Madlib claims he ""probably could have
    bought a house or two"" with all the money he's spent on collecting records
    over the years. And, given his wildly divergent tastes, it hardly seems like an
    exaggeration. So, while <em>Chrome Children</em>
    is probably best digested on a track-by-track basis, its diversity is true to
    the spirit of a ruthlessly progressive label marked by its deep roots to the past.

    It takes the better part of
    an hour to ride the F train from the East Village to Coney Island, but it feels
    much longer. Because you're not just traveling through the boroughs but back through
    the decades as well, to a place where it's 1953 all the time-- a fairground fantasia
    that looks as if it's about to be swallowed by the imposing, endless expanse of the
    Atlantic Ocean. Coney Island feels like the last stop before the edge of the
    world. It's our collective vision of impending death, writ large in Ferris-wheel
    lights and cotton candy: One last flash of childhood nostalgia before we disappear
    into the void.</p><p>
    Thirty years ago, this is
    where Lou Reed went to bottom out and cash in his chips. Even if he wasn't
    dead, his career pretty much was: While hindsight has granted 1975's electronic-noise
    experiment <em>Metal Machine Music</em> a contrarian classic-- celebrated more as a symbolic
    ""fuck you"" than as a musical composition-- the reality was it forced him into a
    precarious financial position where he was being sued by his ex-manager and living
    day-to-day in the Gramercy Park Hotel, with the bill footed by a sympathetic
    RCA boss who forced Reed to, in his own words, ""go in and make a rock record."" But
    when he did, creating what was to become <em>Coney Island Baby</em>, instead of referring to his usual inspirations-- transvestites, junkies, the
    underclass-- Reed exposed a far more shadowy, fascinating
    entity: his heart.</p><p>
    By 1976, we had already heard Reed do pretty much everything that could be done in a pop song: shoot heroin,
    suck on a ding-dong, kiss shiny boots of leather. And yet nothing he had done was
    quite as shocking as the revelation on <em>Coney Island Baby</em>'s devastating title
    track that he always ""wanted to play football for the coach."" But as the song drifts
    along its elegiac six-minute arc, the idea moves from the ridiculous (Lou as linebacker?)
    to the sublime (nothing fuels a young man's burgeoning homosexual impulses like
    getting pat on the butt by brawny alpha males in tights) to the unspeakably
    poignant: rock's reigning iconoclast admitting that he just wanted to fit in
    all along.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Coney Island Baby</em> is the
    sound of Reed playing ball, assembling a stellar cast of backing players (bassist
    Bruce Yaw, guitarist Bob Kulick, and drummer Michael Suchorsky) to elevate his gutter-bound
    songwriting up to 70s FM rock-radio standards. You can see why some critics deemed
    the album a commercial concession: ""Charley's Girl"" is essentially a mash-up of
    Reed's two biggest hits, setting ""Sweet Jane"" strums to the doo-doo-doo cadence
    of ""Walk on the Wild Side""; ""She's My Best Friend"" was an old Velvet
    Underground rave-up reborn as an elegant, theatrical six-minute set piece. But
    even if the guitar solos verge on Eric Clapton/Mark Knopfler levels of
    tastefulness, it's hard to imagine another singer-songwriter from the era producing
    a song as chilling as ""Kicks"", a survey of vices that proffers murder as the
    ultimate high, with Reed effectively laying down the challenge to those who
    want to live vicariously through his seedy explorations.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Kicks"" is the track that benefits
    most from this 30th anniversary reissue's superb, wintry-crisp
    remastering job, playing up the contrast between the song's creeping momentum
    and its house-party ambience, while the random, sudden foregrounding of the background
    chatter-- reminiscent of Reed's own intrusions on John Cale's ""Lady Godiva's Operation""-- is as startling as the best horror-movie shocks. And the title track's dreamy
    reminiscence is, of course, more vivid and affecting than ever, heavenly white
    soul that inhabits the same rarefied sphere as Van Morrison's <em>Astral Weeks</em>. Among
    this reissue's six bonus tracks is a stripped-down acoustic demo of ""Coney
    Island Baby"" that would be right at home on the third Velvets album, but feels
    less revelatory; what made the final version such a triumph was that Reed was
    not just revealing his emotions, but rendering them in lushly detailed strokes.
    </p>
<p>
    The remaining bonus tracks-- most of which were recorded with VU holdover Doug Yule-- find Reed's rock'n'roll heart beating loudly and proudly, with ""Nowhere at All"" and ""Leave Me
    Alone"" flexing a muscular Stonesy blues that Reed would further indulge on 1978's
    tougher-than-leather <em>Street Hassle</em>. But <em>Coney Island Baby</em> was not the right
    time for Lou to be acting tough; this most sensitive album made in his darkest
    hour required a lightness of touch. Even if Lou never made the football team, with
    <em>Coney Island Baby</em> he at least remembered the most important play to get the
    fans back onside: go deep.

    The band's from Austin, Texas' crowded, hyper-self-conscious scene rather than that brewery-scented city in Wisconsin, and it's probably named after the song Glenn Sutton wrote (popularized by Jerry Lee Lewis and covered by Rod Stewart) about beer-mongering leading to loserdom. Its scattershot Barsuk debut, consisting of a refangled version of their 2004 self-produced debut plus four tracks overseen by Spoon's Jim ""The Other"" Eno, will probably leave subscribers to the identity-myth feeling jerked around.</p><p>
    Shouldn't bands have ""a sound""? Not necessarily, reckon, especially if their talents are all spastic and confidently roaming. Shouldn't albums ""cohere""? Not necessarily, reckon, especially if the band presumably feels that certain tracks are better served with vastly different vocal treatments and instrument tones. But check out the ride provided by <em>Trying to Never Catch Up</em>'s turbo-jalopy: You get three initial songs of Franz Ferdinstrokes suped up with the synths that the Faint suped up after the Rentals' suping up of the Cars, and that's okay, until one notices the third song (""Hellodrama"") suddenly doesn't shy away from lyrical dumdingers such as ""You keep on doing that thing to me/ It's like you're dragging me down into your disease, yeah/ Can't you see you're bringing me to my knees, yeah?""</p><p>
    Fourth song the ominously titled ""Selling Yourself Short"" yanks the electro tincture and settles for some piano and horns over some (more) fine Strokesness. At least one version of the album peaks during this track's first three minutes, despite the generic aftertaste and the hammer recklessly handed to critics with the line ""Please don't make it worse with false sincerity."" <span> </span>The finale's counting from one to five, and subsequent scatting (a motif that'll get abused by album's end) combine to form a most unpromising resolution to the song's indie-vamp breakdown.
    </p>
<p>
    By now the listener wonders how much these unabashed capitalists (in interviews) are craving (via Barsuk) some Death Cab for Cutie coattails. Among my most boorish and indefensible opinions is this stinker: ""<em>Straight females are the only people who have any reason to listen to Death Cab for Cutie</em>."" Even though Gibby Haynes and Glenn Danzig represent the (equally silly) opposite of Gibbard's gummy courtship persona, they seem to have more to teach us about how soul meets body?
    </p>
<p>
    But wait: Suddenly this band with three songwriters begins to generate a singular vision, as the next few songs suggest Rufus Wainwright backed by an indie rock ensemble. But wait: Then they do committee-penned rock slumming as savvy acoustic singer-songwriter lonesomeness for a number! Then they do mild art-rock. Then emo gets a toss. Then they close with two bouncy ones reminiscent of Madness and Ben Folds being tumble-dried. These 12 songs are probably big fun for the band to play out, but the whole cocky mélange never rises elsewhere to the heights of its overwrought and cheese-risking (in the good way) midpoint ""The Jeopardy of Contentment"", and even that one gives listeners prosey, almost parental pause: ""We have to fess up and face the facts the best we can/ Or live with the consequence."" Effervescence and freshness are so doggone dissimilar. Thus, this quartet's assured sound-and-fury is perplexingly difficult to care about.

    You'd think that a song called ""The President's Dead"",
    especially coming from a brainy indie band like Okkervil River, would be a
    protest song, a wistful bit of liberal daydreaming, just as you'd think a song
    called ""In God We Still Trust"", especially coming from a Nashville country band
    like Diamond Rio, would be a very different sort of protest song. But Will
    Sheff's composition, which opens the Australian tour EP <em>Overboard &amp; Down</em>, isn't an executive
    threat or demonstration-ready sloganeering. Instead, it's merely
    a means of making the political very personal, of finding some humanity in the
    closed sphere of D.C. politics. It's ambiguous enough to apply to JFK or Bush
    or Martin Sheen.</p><p>
    The song begins, as many Okkervil
    River songs do, with Sheff's voice
    over an acoustic strum and eventually ramps up, as many Okkervil
    River songs do, into a passionate
    climax. Sheff uses national tragedy (""A shout from the crowd and a shot in the
    head-- the president's lying on the tarmac dead"") to consider the joys of life:
    waking up to his girlfriend, smelling coffee brewing and bacon cooking, walking
    around his new place. Reflecting on the assassination, he finds a small kernel
    of contentment-- a commodity so rare in the Okkervil
    River canon that ""The President's
    Dead"" sounds all the more endearing and powerful.</p><p>
    This being an Okkervil
    River release, that contentment is inevitably
    short-lived. Like all good storytellers, Sheff is interested in conflict,
    mostly of the man-vs.-himself variety, and he has the uncommon and perhaps
    unenviable gifts for speaking fluently through his misery-heavy characters. That conflict is also reflected in the music,
    which swells and fades to mirror the moods of the songs. There's nothing new or
    experimental on <em>Overboard &amp; Down</em>,
    no odd avenue they're exploring or new instrument they're incorporating, but that
    doesn't mean it's a casual assemblage of random songs. Rather, in addressing
    the vagaries of commitment and the contradictions of humanity in just five
    songs, this well-thought-out EP distills the complexity of their proper albums
    into a single, clear emotional trajectory.
    </p>
<p>
    The four tracks that follow ""The President's Dead"" dismantle
    that song's tentative hope and destroy it entirely. The characters aren't
    necessarily the same throughout this collection, but presumably they're
    anagrams of each other, hinting at an overarching narrative with a steep
    downward spiral. First come doubt and withdrawal on ""The Room I'm Hiding
    In""; with its nonthreatening shamble and curlicue guitar line, it's as pensive
    and interiorized as ""The President's Dead"", but with a casual air that makes
    the character's withdrawal all the more impulsively self-destructive and
    flagrantly self-deluding. That leads fluidly into the pleading and
    recrimination of ""O, Dana"", a surprisingly solid Big Star cover. Okkervil River
    don't change the song too dramatically, retaining its midtempo pace and halting,
    almost-falling-apart dynamic, but replace the scratchy guitar with horns and the boppy chorus with an exclamatory sing-along. 
    </p>
<p>
    Alex Chilton's idiomatic bitterness complements Sheff's
    desperate self-reckoning remarkably well, but ""O, Dana"" is just a warm-up for the
    one-two punch of ""Love to a Monster"" and a truly sinister-sounding live version
    of ""Westfall"". Together these two tracks comprise an emotional chasm: They're
    among the darkest songs Sheff's written, and their pairing at the end of <em>Overboard &amp; Down </em>only spotlights their
    unrelenting bleakness. On ""Love to a Monster"", whose lyrics give <em>Gentleman</em>-era
    Greg Dulli a run for his money, a relationship cracks apart and curdles into
    contempt and violence, as if discarding good memories and becoming emotionally
    masochistic were acts of survival: ""I hope your new man thinks of me when he sees
    what a number I did on you,"" Sheff sings, his measured cadence all the more
    unsettling. Further disconcerting is the spirited stage banter that prefaces
    the murder ballad ""Westfall"". Sheff addresses his audience amiably. Cracks a
    joke. Thanks the opening band. Then launches into a tale of a young killer
    remembering and rejoicing in the death of a girl named Lori. It's as if murder,
    whether literal or figurative, were the last stage in ending a relationship. 
    </p>
<p>
    Never allowing the songs to venture outside his head-- they
    chronicle the reminiscences of events, not the events themselves-- Sheff
    doesn't distance himself from his characters, but goes to great lengths to
    identify himself with the protagonist: On ""Love to a Monster"" he sings
    about ""each last letter sent you from the cheap little pen of this weak little
    man,"" then clarifies: ""this one singing."" It might be tempting at first to
    queasily dismiss these songs as emotionally masochistic confessions, but
    Okkervil River work their way to this extreme position quite logically: <em>Overboard &amp; Down</em>, like most of the
    band's releases, reveals how even the happiest of heights carries the potential
    for misery, how love holds a kernel of contempt. That Sheff reaches this
    conclusion from such an unexpectedly content moment on ""The President's Dead""
    only makes this EP all the more poignant.

On one hand, they have proper fans: people who buy their albums, people who care. On the other hand, they have, well, everyone else. Among fans of pop music and dabblers alike, it's surprisingly hard to find anyone who doesn't harbor some affection for this duo. When it comes to their 1980s output, this is UK pop success nearing the level of Prince, Madonna, Michael Jackson. Starting in 1991, the best shorthand for the PSB world was <em>Discography</em>, an 18-track singles collection that could be found perennially popping up-- like the dance-pop equivalent of Bob Marley's <em>Legend</em>-- in record collections of countless sorts and sizes. <em>PopArt: The Hits</em>, now officially available in the U.S., aims to replace that, adding an extra decade of hits, and splitting the whole of it over two loosely themed discs: ""Pop"" (more disco) and ""Art"" (more ballads).</p><p>
    It's worth nothing that we don't have much of this kind of act in America. Our pop stars are relentlessly young, and these days they're expected to be knowable, physical, and guileless; the words they sing are meant to dramatize who they actually are, and how great they are at it (just like you). We worship at the altar of the words <em>I Am</em>, <em>I Can</em>, <em>I Will</em>, and <em>I'm Gonna</em>. (We're also notoriously averse to frothy disco, except as a novelty: Our dance music comes from hip-hop.) The Pet Shop Boys belong in a British role that's irresistibly far from that, a lineage of pop laureates of the sort that Jarvis Cocker and Saint Etienne aspire to be. They're commentators, not dramatizers-- mature, arch, and crafty. (The point isn't <em>them</em>-- these two guys, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe-- but what they might write about the world.) It should be ironic, then, that their timeless first single, ""West End Girls"", was popular in America before it caught on at home, but notice how perfectly it packages and exports that whole laureate role. We meet Tennant not as a singer, not as an attention-getter, but as a <em>speaker</em>: He mumbles the verses to us not like a star, but like a stranger in a raincoat, slinking alongside you and pointing out the sights.</p><p>
    It's that odd twist that makes the group's 80s hits so easy to love, and so hard to dislike: They're too unassuming to be bothered by. The music may be clattering hi-NRG synth-pop, and full of high drama, but Tennant's thin, moneyed voice and cheeky play-acting cut against it: He's not a spotlight-hog, just a lone schemer in an expensive suit. It's these hits-- the same ones on <em>Discography</em>-- that a Pet Shop Boys compilation is <em>for</em>; these are their touchstone contributions to the history of pop music. You don't need to be told that they're fantastic, any more than you need to be told that <em>Thriller</em> is fantastic. These songs are, in a way, the urtext of dance-pop: The alternately ecstatic and ominous lilt of ""Suburbia""; the strangely mellow, downtempo Latin freestyle on ""Domino Dancing""; or the incredibly sly, stylish sing-speak on ""Left to My Own Devices"".</p><p>
    They are also the urtext of everything the modern American 13-year-old male would describe as ""totally gay"" (and possibly the modern American 50-year-old male, too)-- but this, ironically, seems like one of the main reasons Americans get to enjoy them. One of their greatest singles is a sappy Euro-disco cover of the Village People's ""Go West"", complete with house piano and horns and diva backing, over which Tennant sings with the dreamy primness of a drag-queen Twiggy; another is a grand trancey version of ""Always on My Mind"", on which the Boys sound like they're taking a pop-chart victory lap. It's euphoric, hands-in-the-air, heart-swelling dance-pop, the sort that's almost less for dancing and more for hugging the people you're dancing with. (See also: Daft Punk's ""One More Time"".) Calling it camp is like calling Madonna calculating: There's no point.</p><p>
<em>Discography</em>, of course, offered all of this-- and all in a row, ready to be thrown on at house parties and left there to do its work. <em>PopArt</em> is a longer dip, and given its non-chronological sequencing, it begins to feel more like an album than a greatest-hits compilation: Hanging around between those joyous scorchers are songs from the duo's second decade, during which their laureate role took them away from euphoria and into ballads, character studies, and even more subtlety. The value of this isn't just as a deeper relationship than <em>Discography</em> offered-- <em>Pop/Art</em> is like a two-week fling compared to <em>Discography</em>'s dazzling one-night stand-- but also as a contrast to the solipsism of America's pop. Tennant's level of nuance and introspection may be an obvious point of praise, part of the conventional wisdom of what this act is about, but it's still true: There's a depth to his writing, and to the premises and situations he starts from, that begs a lot of unraveling. (See: ""Can You Forgive Her?"" or ""Being Boring"".) It's this attention to the complexity of the world-- the switch from the teenaged <em>I Am</em> to the worldly <em>Are We?</em>-- that makes these songs captivating, even as the duo tries to navigate massive changes in the world of dance music, dabbles in Latino sounds, and drifts off toward milky, less vibrant ballads.</p><p>
    The collection certainly doesn't make the Pet Shop Boys look as good as <em>Discography</em> did, and if that's your yardstick for a good compilation-- creating the sense of endless, unfaltering brilliance, and then leaving you with nothing but good feelings for the act-- this might not do the trick; sometime during that two-week fling, you start to see the qualities that take time and inclination to love. At the same time, that makes this collection much more than an update of <em>Discography</em>: It's no longer just a string of pop hits to throw on when people are around, but something you can spend time digging your way through and coming to grips with-- less a greatest-hits package, and more a Portable Pet Shop Boys, in something approaching their totality. It's certainly worth it: As far as England's dance-pop laureates are concerned, this is right up there with Saint Etienne's <em>Smash the System</em> as your single-artist desert-island dance mix.</p></div>"|9487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9487-popart-the-hits/|8.1|Nitsuh Abebe

    subtracted for the band name. Just in case you think I've got an agenda, let me air it out for you right here: I like bands that remind me of my other favorite bands. Ho-Ag's latest, <em>The Word From Pluto</em>, has plenty of hip touchstones in their blizzard of sound-- Les Savy Fav, Brainiac, Devo-- but played with bravery, balance, and smarts, carrying with it the feel of basement shows rather than arty detachment. You'd be lucky to find a basement with these guys playing in it. I'm lucky to have come across it.</p><p>
    More on hip: These guys' haircuts are...often inadvisable. More on influence: Put together their CD collections, these five gentlemen probably have the entire Fishbone discography among them. More on why none of that matters: ""Paint the Navy"" blows out of the gates with metronome-steady rhythms, blaring guitars, and keyboards that seem as if they'll malfunction at any point. 
    ""Under the Maps"" features greater dynamic leaps, moving from windmill strums to head-bobbing bass
    and chicken-scratch chords, while singer Mat Parish plays along with whispered
    croons to megaphone-augmented emoting. ""Lemon Juice or Vinegar"" makes
    idle threats over muted guitars and seasick rhythms, but just in case they lost
    momentum (they didn't), ""TDPK"" resumes the sputtering chaos where guitars
    angle, the rhythm section stops and starts, and the synths squeal like pigs
    getting branded. But for a group that sounds like a science project with a
    drug stipend, everything's somehow in its right place. It's dance-punk,
    spazz-rock, rawk-revival, and post-hardcore-- all for a minute at a time at least.</p><p>
    Given that, there's a surprising amount of ebb and flow here, along with generous dollops of melody. No showing off, just demonstrable chops and the desire to write real songs from a more-than-slightly-askew angle. Parish isn't quite the strong personality that the bands name-dropped above have boasted, but he adds coy personality to ""Lemon Juice and Vinegar"" while still belting out the melodies needed to float the disjointed numbers like ""Paint the Navy"" and more. A more over-the-top vocalist would only clash with Ho-Ag's controlled chaos.
    </p><p>
    But as Levar Burton used to tell you in your cereal-and-pajamas days, you don't have to take my word for it. Start with ""American Mall"" if you get lost, let the keyboards lob you a life preserver while the band spits and seizes around it, and allow momentum-- something <em>The Word From Pluto</em> has in spades-- take you through to ""Pinhead"", the track that brandishes a 10-ton hook and rocks as hard as any 1970s arena act, except the drummer needs to be sober to pull off the ragged rhythms of the chorus. Some of the most welcome surprises are tacked onto the end of the record (""The Hoodoo Sea"" might be the record's best), but you should know by now whether this accessible, prodigious spazz-rock entry isn't for you. If it is, get to work already and find it.

    In the bringing-it-down-a-notch tradition of Cat Power's <em>The
    Covers Record</em>, melancholic Norwegian duo Susanna and the Magical Orchestra
    have followed its ice-veined 2004 debut with a collection of cover tunes.
    Speaking with the band members in August, they told me <em>Melody Mountain</em> was
    originally supposed to be an EP. They decided to record some of the covers
    they'd been doing live and the idea spiraled into a larger project. However
    they arrived at this 10-song collection, it plays to the band's
    strengths: Two years after the release of <em>List of Lights and Buoys</em>,
    their spare, unforgettable take on Dolly Parton's ""Jolene""
    remains the band's calling card.</p><p>
    Instead of coasting along with expected, aesthetically linked updates, <em>Melody
    Mountain</em>'s<em> </em>oddball set list includes imaginative revisions: AC/DC's
    ""It's a Long Way to the Top"", backed by, among other things, cembalo,
    a baroque keyboard instrument; a simplified, back-porch incision of Prince's
    ""Condition of the Heart""; a Cat Powered ramble through Dylan's
    ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"". To the band's credit, every
    choice, no matter how strange at first, ends up sounding real. They <em>own</em>
    each unironic, personalized revision; this isn't some indulgent Gus Van Sant
    meta game.</p><p>
    The honest sound could be a result of the pared-down, two-person lineup,
    coupled with the crystalline Deathprod production. Rather than lugging along
    some weepy string section, the ""orchestra"" is just one guy, ex-Jaga
    Jazzist and Shining member Morten Qvenild. His instrumental expertise and good
    taste lends intricately lush, deftly subtle keyboard/piano/church
    organ-based backdrops. More striking than the band's minimalism are the
    pristine, unpolluted vocals of Susanna Karolina Wallumrød. A true talent in the
    vein of Chan Marshall and Mira Billotte, she sings like a Norwegian mountain
    stream, never over-enunciating or throwing in unnecessary trills. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Melody Mountain</em>'s interpretations vary in shades and gradations.
    Kiss' ""Crazy, Crazy Nights"" becomes a shivery, damp-highway anthem for
    the dispossessed; Scott Walker's ""It's Raining Today"", a spooky, pedal-steeled, echo-chambered finale to a one-woman musical. Live,
    it was ""Hallelujah"" that made the people cry. Most versions of
    Leonard Cohen's transcendent ballad can send tear ducts into overtime, but it's
    a song Susanna and the Magical Orchestra have been performing for a while and
    Wallumrod's pacing and phrasing were masterful-- like she snuck herself into
    each note and lived an entire life inside it before moving onto the next. Here,
    as the hushed, funereal opener, it's pretty tough to top. 
    </p>
<p>
    The song earning the most attention is a taffy-stretched ""Love Will
    Tear Us Apart"", wherein Ian Curtis's most famous libretto is laid bare and
    slowed to half speed. The original's nervously bottled dance is replaced by a
    languid, nearly a capella drift. To go the pop culture route, if this version
    soundtracked <em>Donnie Darko</em>, that make-out scene would become more tenderly
    melancholic, less heady and nerve-wracked. 
    </p>
<p>
    In a great year for mountain albums (think <em>Blood Mountain</em> and <em>Return
    to Cookie Mountain</em>, among others), Susanna &amp; the Magical Orchestra
    contribute the most enigmatic collection to the pile. Of course,
    there's reason to be restrained in the praise: They do a nice job, but these
    are only covers, and it'll be interesting to hear their own songwriting
    developments on future records. In the meantime, <em>Melody Mountain</em> is
    an example of expansive restraint that, surprisingly enough, makes for good
    driving music. Maybe it's the ghosts of particular songs' rocker pasts
    propelling the molasses flow? Hypothermia's phantom aches?

Lots of bands are derivative in ways that expand the sound they're copping. For me there's a simple test to decide if an album is inspired homage or weak imitation: How many listens does it take to stop hearing their influences? Five is great, 10 or 15 is still pretty good. Get up over 20, and there's trouble.</p><p>
    I'm way past that number with Awesome Color, and I still keep hearing the Stooges. I still hear a pale ""Down on the Street"" in the lax guitar and straining vox of ""Grown"", a less catchy ""Loose"" in the labored rhythms of ""Free Man"", even a thin mix of ""Dirt"" and ""Fun House"" in the slow burn (and Steve MacKay-like sax) of the album's best track, ""Animal"". (I also hear the MC5 in ""Ridin'"" and Blue Cheer and Black Sabbath in ""Unknown"", but those aren't exactly big leaps from the Stooges rips.)</p><p>
    The fact that Awesome Color can evoke such strong influences is a decent feat, and there's nothing wrong with using the Stooges (or MC5 or Black Sabbath) as launching points. Fifteen years ago, Mudhoney's unearthing of extra grime from that sound was a revelation, and more recently Comets on Fire struck gold by fusing Stooges-like energy to magnetic Sabbath riffs.
    </p><p>
    But in light of those shining examples, <em>Awesome Color</em> sounds like a retread. Recall how Mudhoney's Mark Arm tweaked Iggy's addled desperation over a spilling Big Muff backdrop with lines like ""I'm full of rot"" and ""Spill my seed, suck my waste."" Compared to that, Awesome Color's generic riffs and lyrical clichés-- ""On the dance floor/ All over this town"", ""Take what you want/ Take what you need"", ""It's your time"" used as a chorus in <em>two</em> songs-- feel even flatter.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, <em>Awesome Color</em> is often enjoyable, mostly due to singer/guitarist Derek Stanton's ability to occasionally hit overdrive. His melodic fuzz and throaty howl catch fire during the frantic ""Ridin'"", and his clanging solos in the churning ""Hat Energy"" and the aforementioned ""Animal"" hit distorted peaks. None of it rises above mimicry, but it's still kinda fun, like a basement show of tribute bands featuring moonlighting musicians from better groups. 
    </p>
<p>
    Given those flashes, it would be unfair to say Awesome Color won't eventually grow into something more unique. These three seem to have enough playing ability to stretch into less-worn territory if their songwriting can manage to lead them there. But their current style has been around for almost 40 years, and many groups have needed no warm up time to carry the ball much farther. Just measuring by the history the band is trying to join, Awesome Color are already behind.

Displaced from its traditional role of party music by dance and hip-hop, rock has focused more than ever on introspection, aiming for resonant feelings rather than escapist fun.  Hence, pop-punk has given way to emo, hard rock acts dust off the power ballad to get airplay, and groups like Coldplay and Green Day fill stadiums with soul-searching anthems. It's only natural that the emotional ante would be rapidly rising, until it reaches the climax of triggering arena-rock's nuclear option: The Boss.</p><p>
    The Killers would seem unlikely participants in the battle to protect The Great American Rock Song, having drawn more comparisons to Duran Duran than Bob Seger on their awkwardly-titled debut <em>Hot Fuss</em>.  But for all the band's synth-pop dressings, their greatest success, both artistically and commercially, was with ""Mr. Brightside"", a woe-is-me epic that skillfully deployed the group's flimsy new-wave organ to shift the song into a second gear of cinematic sorrow.  No dummies, the Killers choose to stay on the horse that got them to the A-list with <em>Sam's Town</em>, spending an entire album looking to build on that track's unabashed glory and so drafting as their muse someone who knows a bit about glory, one Bruce Springsteen.</p><p>
    It's worth noting that the Killers aren't the only contemporary artist to recently start drawing inspiration from Jersey's poet laureate, with everyone from Destroyer to the Hold Steady making like they're the E Street Band this year.  Springsteen may seem like a weird indie-fluence, but given his talents for transforming the passions and struggles of the common people into earnest vocal-cord-splitting rock mythology, it all makes sense.  Just take a listen to the young man's melodrama of ""Born to Run"" without the ""Greatest Song Ever"" baggage it has accumulated, and wonder why Springsteen wasn't ordained as the patron saint of emo years ago.
    </p><p>
    However, emulating The Boss isn't as easy as hiring a sax player and tying a bandana to your head-- and missing the mark by mistaking Springsteen's broadness for simplicity can lead a band toward an ill-advised and pretentious flop.  On <em>Sam's Town</em>, the Killers attempt to incorporate several components of the Springsteen formula: super-sizing their guitar sound, creating fictional characters to externalize their angst, singing boldface banner statements in an impassioned vibrato.  Most tellingly, the band's willingness to flirt with ambition is so daring that they include an ""Enterlude"" and an ""Exitlude"", bookends that aspire to set these songs within a setting that may or may not be based on the Vegas townie casino of the album's title.
    </p>
<p>
    When the Killers hit their mark, they create refreshingly huge rock, the sound of a band unashamed of their success; when they miss, it's testimony that the right ingredients don't always create the same dish.  Both of these outcomes are simultaneously present in lead single ""When You Were Young"", which successfully inherits the thrilling synthesizer peaks of ""Mr. Brightside"" while tripping over the ""Thunder Road""-aping refrain ""he doesn't look a thing like Jesus,""-- clumsy, second-hand religious imagery masquerading as lyrical depth.  Over and over again, the Killers get the medium mostly right (the sledgehammer chords of ""This River Is Wild"", the canned-string crescendos of the title track), but whiff on the message, too often resorting to Cliff-Note Americana like highways and rivers or cartoonish character studies like the addict protagonist of ""Uncle Johnny"".
    </p>
<p>
    The easy target for these near-misses is the madeover Brandon Flowers, though the Killers' new image means he's faced with the difficult task of shifting abruptly from his Robert Smith nasal-whine to Springsteenish bellow.  For instance, quiet moments, like the bridge of ""When You Were Young"" or the outro to ""This River Is Wild"", reveal the heretofore unknown fact that aiming for Springsteen and missing even slightly results in Meat Loaf.  Not that Flowers' bandmates help out any, as a key element of the arena-rock epic, awesome fucking fist-pumping backing vocals, are bungled at every opportunity, from the awkward ""I SEE LONDON, I SEE SAM'S TOWN"" of the opening track to the faux-Queen (""multi-tracking is hard, what if we all just sing in unison?"") of ""Bones"".
    </p>
<p>
    Other places indicate that the band may have just gone for the wrong rock-icon; the reverb-chirp ""higher and higher"" peak of (seriously) ""Bling (Confessions of a King)"" indicates that the Killers are more successful impressionists of <em>Achtung Baby</em>-era U2.  Perhaps it's that the comparatively vague platitudes of Bono fit the Killers more snugly than Springsteen's folk-based specificities, approaching the epic from a universal top-down rather than blowing up life's small moments into monuments (something the Hold Steady album, released on the same day as <em>Sam's Town</em>, gets more consistently right).  Not fully realizing where their strengths and weaknesses lie makes <em>Sam's Town</em>, despite the drastic makeover, roughly equivalent to <em>Hot Fuss</em>, a mediocre album surrounding a few towering singles.

    Subtle recorded <em>for hero: for fool </em>at a higher-priced studio than their last disc, <em>A New White</em>, or their four home-recorded ""finding ourselves"" EPs, and boy, did they do their inflated budget justice: The instruments are vivid, the beats are harder, and the slow parts never just kinda...drift off on you, the way they have in the past. On <em>A New White</em>, Subtle leader Doseone's rhymes sometimes drifted into subliminal messages, and the five guys behind him would follow along into the fog, giving you a kind of resting space where Dose could talk directly to your subconscious.  In other words, you could space out-- or maybe it was the music spacing out on you.  But this time, the lights are on, no detail gets lost, and no matter how cerebral it may be, the whole thing's so loud that it bangs your head for you.  Welcome to Subtle's major label debut.</p><p>
<em>for hero: for fool</em>'s relentless pace will feel familiar to anyone who's witnessed their incredible live set. Dose is one of the tightest frontmen on the road right now, whether he's stalking the stage or yanking plastic utensils out of a black-and-white-striped skull, he's a constant stream of jerky, just-right gestures, and you can practically hear all of them on this recording.  The mic is in love with Dose no matter what he's doing, from the paper airplane high notes to the deep percussive grunts-- though the words move so fast that you won't appreciate any of the lyrics until you can sit down and read them, preferably someplace quiet.  Too soon to tell if America at large is ready for Dose's poems, his intricate imagery, or his ongoing story about a rapper named Hour Hero Yes.  (That's the guy with the black-and-white skull.)  But here, he's nailing what fellow motormouth Busdriver once dubbed ""stadium rap"": The words aren't dumbed down, but the crowds will come for the sheer calesthenics of their tongue-work.</p><p>
    The first four tracks lunge off the album, from the tight interplay of beats and staccato rhymes on ""A Tale of Apes II"" to the guitar riff on ""Middleclass Stomp"" that splits the difference between hard rap and hard rock.  Far more intense and less-- wait for it-- subtle than anything they led us to expect, the album starts to pace itself by track five, delivering a deft combination of the polished electronics of the 13 &amp; God project and the harsher fuzz of Themselves.  The intricate glitches and big synth swaths sound like they were programmed, not with a laptop, but on rice paper punch cards-- and then they melt into power chords and cavernous live drums that could've been taped in a bar band rehearsal space.  
    </p>
<p>
    But while you're trying to pick out the details, the main impression is that it's <em>loud</em>.  You would never know from his cameos that they have a full-time cellist (who sounds like he's bowing with a razor on ""Middleclass Stomp"").  And as clearly as the music comes across, most of the lyrics rush by without even a stray word or image catching your ear, and the slower songs like ""Call to Dive"" especially suffer from sounding so opaque.  And where the top songs on <em>A New White</em>, ""I Heart L.A."" and ""F.K.O."", had a sweet, mixed-up innocence and introspection, the first single here is ""The Mercury Craze"", which is fast, crazy-catchy, and so manic you can almost hear their teeth chattering.
    </p>
<p>
    For four EPs and one LP, Subtle didn't sound like a cohesive unit so much as six guys in a cloud of possibilities.  Now they've grabbed one or two directions and made their strongest disc to date-- but I <em>still </em>don't know what this band's about.  You could assume a lot about this album from what was happening in their lives when they made it.  The band almost broke up after the van accident that left keyboardist and central inspiration Dax Pierson paralyzed, and that cut short their first national tour.  Then Dose and guitarist/drummer Jordan Dalrymple locked themselves in the studio and started making demos again, and gradually brought in the other four-- including Dax-- to finish a new album.  Pierson is still a part of the band, and a part of this disc; he contributes vocals, and that's him, pre-accident, beatboxing and playing piano during the final song.  But the chemistry has changed, the music is harder, the frustration's more palable, and you can hear that this is some kind of a make-or-break moment. And this time they made it-- just.  I can't wait to hear who they become on the next one.

The Berlin duo (Mark Ernestus and Moritz Von Oswald) and its eponymous label were among the earliest German outfits to interface with Detroit techno's first generation; its fame came from steadily whittling down house and techno to unprecedented degrees of minimalism while making explicit the links between techno and dub reggae. In recent years, Ernestus and Von Oswald have largely backed away from techno, turning their attentions to reissues of classic dub and a pair of new projects, Rhythm &amp; Sound and Burial Mix, that approximate the sound of vintage dub reggae via drum machines, cool analog synths (or their virtual counterparts), and extensive effects. Each effort features vocal performances from singers like Paul St. Hilaire (aka Tikiman), Cornel Campbell, and the Chosen Brothers, who croon and mutter, alternatingly devotional and simply stoned, as though dancehall and gun talk never happened. It is, without a doubt, a kind of purist's music, approaching every cut as though trying to fashion, once and for all, the Ideal Dub Side; it's also all pretty great, and occasionally exquisite. But the sheer volume of the stuff, every record a version of a version of a variation, can feel like a glut.</p><p>
    So a remix compendium could have been tedious business; Rhythm &amp; Sound have basically been remixing themselves from the beginning. Instead, <em>See Mi Yah Remixes</em>, featuring reworks of a number of tracks originally released on 7"" in 2005 and later compiled as <em>See Mi Yah</em>, is deliciously eccentric: At once an homage to Basic Channel's dubwise legacy and a repudiation of reflexive brow-furrowing, it's also, in part, a welcome return to the dance floor.</p><p>
    Unsurprisingly, the most predictable versions come from within the Basic Channel camp itself-- although in no way should ""predictable"" be read pejoratively. Vainqueur, one of Basic Channel sublabel Chain Reaction's best artists, breaks a half-decade's silence with the blissful lapping of digital whitecaps laid over a pulse so steady it seems to come from the earth's core itself-- in other words, exactly what he's always done, and praise Jah for it. Chain Reaction artists Substance and Hallucinator-- both also mostly inactive for years-- and Basic Channel themselves offer more traditionally reggaefied versions; all ping and crackle and gently sloping skank, this is reggae from an ambient junkie's perspective, the sound of stretching out and wrapping yourself in a cocoon of filtered delay. Their tricks are dead simple, but you won't find music produced more subtly or generously.
    </p><p>
    Somewhat inexplicably, Francois K. breaks the unity of what otherwise would have been the year's best comedown albums with a drum'n'bass roller; I think this is what they call ""liquid"" d'n'b, but the effect is about as soothing as ice cubes thrust down your collar. Abandoning the 4/4 (or the 2/4) feels like an unnecessary provocation-- <em>especially</em> coming from a disco and house legend. And maybe he meant it as a provocation, or at least a reminder that dub isn't only music for stoners. But the dry, crisp breakbeats cut against the swirly, sodden motion of the rest of the song in such a way that doesn't feel so much schizo as merely arbitrary. 
    </p>
<p>
    Minimal techno darlings Sleeparchive and Vladislav Delay both turn in serviceable, if uncertain, cuts: Sleeparchive's sounds like he's searching for a way to drape dub's ample flesh over his dessicated, skeletal rhythms, and Delay's employs a breaks-based two-step pattern that's just sort of inexplicable. But these take-'em-or-leave-'em moments are more than made up for by the comp's three most outré offerings, all of which count among 2006's best singles. Soundstream, aka Smith 'n Hack's Soundhack, harnesses a bevy of string vamps and horn stabs to turn ""Free For All"" into a gently controlled free-for-all of disco soul; if all deep house were this good, the West Coast would be a much better place to live.
    </p>
<p>
    Ricardo Villalobos goes predictably bonkers with his contribution, spinning bleating woodwinds, organ wheeze and rubberized drums into a dew-flecked web that catches Ras Donovan's alto croon (and baritone gibberish) like so many iridescent flies, the flicker of their wings slowing as the inevitable approaches. And Carl Craig trumps everyone with ""Poor People Must Work"". On the one hand it's simply Craig doing what he does best, stretching a riff to inifinity as though filters were invented yesterday and were still believed infallible enough to serve as a sky-bridge to Mars. Just as on his remixes of Delia &amp; Gavin's ""Relevee"" and Theo Parrish's ""Falling Up"", those long. Chords. Just. Keep. Churning. But it's what he does with Bobbo Shanti's vocals that's so mindblowing, chopping them down to a truncated stutter and letting them strobe against the time, spitting and gasping and throwing sparks. Reset within the context of Craig's frantic rave-up, lines like ""There is no place to sleep/ There is nothing to eat"" lose the trappings of class solidarity and seem to speak instead to the frazzled clubbers of the neverending weekend-- proof that Rhythm &amp; Sound's raw material proves more malleable than perhaps even the ascetic Basic Channelers might have guessed.

After effortlessly painting a portrait of a jilted lover (""An illusion; it's just not true/ We've always been me and you""), she ends the track on a repeated refrain--  one of us, one of us.  Most folks will recognize that line from the movie <em>Freaks</em>, a twisted love story that turns into a tale of revenge set amongst a carnival freak show.  The circus freaks-- pinheads, hermaphrodites, an inchworm-like man made up of little more than a torso and a head-- use this line as a disquieting rallying cry, and it works the same way in Germano's song.  It's cold comfort for those that have been there to know they're not alone, even though they are. A chorus of Germanos-- breathy, exhausted-- against a plainly pretty piano backdrop only adds to the unsettling mood.</p><p>
    For Germano, this push-pull between pretty and unsettling is nothing new.  Most of her songs resemble lullabies, but they're the sort of songs only Wednesday Addams would find comforting.  ""In the Land of Fairies"" would be one of Wednesday's favorites, what with Germano affecting a deceptive sing-song cadence to talk about stupid ogres and monsters that aren't as much the stuff of the Brothers Grimm but of dementia (""Every little soul has/ Sides you've never seen"").  Germano's vocal affectations-- she sounds like she's waking up with a frog in her throat-- also work well on ""Red Thread"". The potentially clumsy call-and-response chorus of ""Go to hell/ Fuck you"" is redeemed by her self-awareness and lack of guile.</p><p>
    Whatever subtlety Germano's voice and lyrics might lack is buttressed by the deceptive simplicity of her music.  Perhaps her songcraft is too deceptive-- a casual listener might think these songs are just gauzy doodles of piano and guitar.  But an attentive ear will learn otherwise.  She knows when to hit a bum note, as on the flat chord struck during ""Land of Fairies"" or the sourness in ""A Seed"".  She can also conjure moments of surprising beauty.  The album's final track, ""After Monday"", veers into a tar bed of subtly distorted guitar, but then just as quickly swoops into a gorgeous piano passage.  Moments like this are indicative of Germano's talent.  She can unearth the darkness in the most innocuous scenes, as well as allow light to shine into the bleakest of corners, and does so while expertly straddling the line between poignant and absurd.  Would that we could all be freaks like her.</p></div>"|9486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9486-in-the-maybe-world/|7.5|David Raposa

    The latest album-- and first North American release-- from Swedish grindcore-cum-stereo selector
    trio Teddybears is like an aural Jackson Pollack painting, marked by splattered strands
    of color, but the whole picture never comes into focus. Instead the group
    once known as Skull offers a curious blend of electro, quasi-dancehall, krautrock,
    Detroit punk, dance-rock, and several other styles and applies them almost at
    random. There's a long, slithery bass line at the heart of most of
    the songs, but with guest vocalists chipping in on nearly half the album, the
    karaoke effect takes hold, siphoning a discernible personality from a band
    that's clearly experiencing some healthy genre-identity issues.</p><p>
    This kind of musical hopscotch isn't necessarily a bad thing,
    and at times <em>Soft Machine</em> feels like a <em>DJ-Kicks </em>compilation from Teddybears' backbone,
    Jonas and Klas Ahlund. The frisky Cybotron-esque ""Automatic Lover"", which features vocoder-style
    crooning over smashing cymbals, acts as fitting rejoinder to post-<em>Human
    After All</em> drudgery. If only the Teddybears could have spread that strand of paint a bit
    thinner.</p><p>
    ""Yours to Keep"" is the album's centerpiece. Built on the strength of a
    much-hyped duet between Annie and Neneh Cherry-- suddenly
    relevant in a post-M.I.A. world-- ""Yours to Keep"" should be a
    sassy treat. But their divergent voices make for a less than stellar
    combination: Cherry is all untrained edges and attitude, if slightly rusty,
    while Annie's airy delivery is a bit more precious. Thus you have a cloying
    mess. That song is sandwiched between Mad Cobra's oddly popular ""Cobrastyle""
    and Elephant Man's obnoxious guest spot on ""Are You Feelin' It?"" ""Cobrastyle""
    has been a commercial beast appearing over images of digitized soccer players,
    German lager, and professional wrestlers alike. This may have facilitated Teddybears' emergence in the U.S.
    as a production curio. Cobra's interpolation of Kid Rock's ""Bawitdaba"" on the
    track is hopelessly corny, and it's a shame because it's one of the few beats--
    a post-ska attempt at pop-- that's got replay value. ""Are You Feelin' It?,"" on
    the other hand, is mired in recycled reverberating guitars and Elephant Man's
    insolent toasting.
    </p>
<p>
    Save the minimal punk-funk forum for hero Iggy Pop (whose
    menacing oil drum of a voice still sounds great) on ""Punkrocker"", the latter
    half of <em>Soft Machine</em> is a garden for the group's singer Patrik Arve to plant
    pseudo-intellectual lyrics in his Teuton-travels-to-Jamaica moan. While
    Teddybears' fusion of funkier, organic styles with the rigid bloops and blips
    of European dance music are occasionally inspired, the vocals are fairly
    dreadful and the songwriting isn't quite engaging. Closer ""Alma""
    is a quiet, atmospheric journey that is hopefully a portent of things to come
    for the trio. It's languorous and thoughtful, in no rush to make an impression, unlike the eager lookey-here guest-laden tracks up front. Despite the major
    label-backing (Atlantic is distributing this album) and
    the cheers of a few outlying hep vocalists, Teddybears are perhaps best served
    doing them. Who that is, exactly, isn't yet clear.

""[The songs would] change depending on what mood you're in,"" imagines     Jonze. ""Or, depending on when you listen to them at a different age,     they'll mean something different."" In many ways, Beck's discography     embodies this idyllic malleability; from the sullen strains of Nick Drake to     food'n'sex funk to broken-down blues to awkward boho-beat hip-hop, his oeuvre     is a one-stop shop-- emotionally and sonically-- that defied stagnation for more than a decade. But his track     record took a hit with last year's <i>Guero</i>, the first Beck album that cited Beck     as its primary musical influence.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the same can be said for <i>The Information</i>, which is     made from a similar scattershot, self-referencing pastiche. But there are key     variations that give the new album a cohesion its predecessor lacked. This     time, über-producer Nigel Godrich is the main collaborator, and his psychedelic     studio wizardry one-ups the Dust Brothers' sample-based concoctions at nearly     every turn. The record also benefits from a future-sick quasi-concept worthy of     Philip K. Dick (or Thom Yorke). While still lyrically cryptic (sometimes     maddeningly so), Beck injects many tracks with the distress of an attuned     cultural observer raising a child in an age of phony wars, data saturation, and     government-sanctioned apathy. The deadpan delivery remains intact, but his     anxiousness and anger are more pointed than before.</p>
<p>Over a brisk groove, Beck states his frustrations on opener     ""Elevator Music"", a damning critique of prettified American culture.     The song details the troubling unreality of modern times, where the public is     relegated to ""fly on the wall"" status, distracted by media overflow     and the nine-to-five grind. ""When you're down and out, pounded, and     there's nothing that's real/ It's like a plastic heart too amputated to     feel,"" raps Beck. His trademark spoken-word rambles are still rhythmically     challenged and verbose, but, in context, the unorthodox flow can offer a vulnerable     counterpart to the scathing precision of lines like, ""If I could forget     myself/ Find another lie to tell/ From the bottom of an oil well/ Cell phone's     ringing to talk to my brain cells."" As with most Beck songs, meanings are     fluid, imprecise, and listener-specific, and <i>The Information</i>'s strange wordplay     lies somewhere between the straightforward heartbreak of <i>Sea Change</i> and the     non-sequitur absurdity of <i>Odelay</i>. While the music sometimes suggests the manic     hodge-podge of his mid-90s material, there's no more getting ""crazy with     the cheese whiz."" Nearly every word on <i>The Information</i> has a distinct purpose.</p>
<p>Whether quoting the robot strut of Herbie Hancock's     ""Chameleon"" on ""Cellphone's Dead"", driving a trippy     krautrock beat through the title track, or scratching up the hallucinatory dub     of ""We Dance Alone"", <i>The Information</i> pumps musical life into its     references thanks to Godrich's space-age sheen. Yet, this upbeat liveliness is     often subverted by Beck's increasingly hopeless obsession with death and decay.</p>
<p>With its graveyard calisthenics, windshield-wiping reaper,     and roving coffin, 1994's ""Loser"" video made this particular     preoccupation clear early on. But back then, at age 23, Beck was laughing at     death and vouching for the sexiness of the netherworld. Now, at 36, there's     little room for such frivolousness. Multiple appearances of words like     ""desert,"" ""cremation,"" and ""dust"" ground <i>The     Information</i> in stark morbidness. And the once-favored devil has been replaced     by a more sinister ""lord"" who will ""take his motorcade and drive     us into the dirt."" Religious cynicism and technological paranoia meet on     ""The Information"", an unforgiving apocalyptic vision: ""When the     information comes we'll know what we're made from,"" sneers Beck. Elsewhere, the ill-fated ""Soldier Jane""     lies comatose at best, and, whispering on the slow motion ballad ""Dark     Star,"" Beck sees the American dream perishing at the hands of misguided     warmongers: ""A widow's tears washing a soldier's bones/ Sterilized egos,     delirium sequels/ Punctured by the arrows of American eagles."" Meanwhile, the album's     most haunting eulogy ditches political commentary for something more personal.</p>
<p>Quiet and forceful, ""New Round"" sounds like a gift     from father to son. ""Every little step/ Every new direction/ The closer     you will get,"" sings Beck, taking full advantage of his underappreciated     vocal timbre. But, instead of ending up as yet another sappy ""dad"" song,     ""New Round"" looks ahead to the inevitable disconnect between parent     and child. ""And farther away/ You'll go from where we are,"" he     continues. Backed by spare acoustic guitars and a calm break beat, the     harrowing love letter exudes a fierce passion missing from other parts of <i>The     Information</i>.</p>
<p>While his lyrics offer few solutions to the current onslaught     of ones and zeros, Beck encourages user-side involvement by offering blank cover     art and a sheet of stickers that fans can arrange how they please (possibly a tribute     to his grandfather, a founder of the similarly democratic 60s art movement Fluxus). But participation is also required to comb through the album's low points-- as in deleting the duds from your iPod. ""Strange     Apparition"", on which Beck does a warbling Chris Cornell impression over     rollicking Rolling Stones piano, is too boisterous when stacked against the     album's stealthy charms. ""Motorcade"", on the other hand, is barely     there; it's a soured tangerine dream, reliant on Godrich's aural doodads and     little else. And, although Beck and friends goof around on the     accompanying DVD (featuring super lo-fi videos for every song), it     looks like the type of project that's more fun to make than it is to watch.</p>
<p>After Jonze gives his take on the ever-changing super     album at the end of disc, Eggers politely disagrees. ""I     don't like it when they change, it frightens me,"" he admits. ""It     makes me feel like someone's pushing me from below, trying to turn me over and     put me down."" As he edges close to middle age, Beck is stuck between the     spontaneity of old and a safer middle ground. Although <i>The Information</i> contains     some of his most aware, intriguing lyrical head-scratchers yet, the familiar     musical settings are something of a letdown from an artist famous for complete reinvention.     ""Thought I saw a ghost but it might have been me,"" he raps on     ""We Dance Alone"", ""might have been a world that was moving too fast,     caught up in a future that was drunk on the past."" It always used to feel     like Beck was years beyond us but, as <i>The     Information</i> attests, the universal struggle is finally catching up with him. Took     long enough.</p></div>"|9485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9485-the-information/|6.9|Ryan Dombal

On the tape McGonigal apparently included ""The Orchids"" by Psychic TV, introducing Rutili to a track that Califone has now re-interpreted as the evocative centerpiece for their amazing new <em>Roots and Crowns</em> album. Moral of the story: When McGonigal puts together a selection of songs, it might be prudent to pay close attention.</p><p>
    The latest issue of <em>Yeti</em>-- McGonigal's new post-<em>Chemical Imbalance</em> arts and music journal-- is another 244-page whopper chock-full of absorbing thoughts and visions. In addition to the proverbial smorgasbord of fiction and visual art, <em>Yeti #4</em> also includes a tour diary by Okkervil River's Will Sheff, Destroyer's Dan Bejar interviewed by a rambunctious eight-year-old tyke, and features on such disparate artists as sci-fi author Octavia Butler, comedian Todd Barry, and street gospel singer Rev. Louis Overstreet. Other fascinating tidbits include crime writer Peter Doyle's collection of vintage Australian crime-scene photos and a thought-provoking exegesis of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" by Drew Daniel of Matmos/Pitchfork.</p><p>
    As has become its hallmark, most of the material in <em>Yeti #4</em> initially appears to have little in common besides the general ability to attract McGonigal's voracious attentions. This same sense of wide-ranging curiosity also extends to <em>Yeti #4's</em> accompanying 28-track CD, which features rare or previously unreleased recordings from Destroyer, Okkervil River, Bright, and Page France. On this CD, McGonigal shows that there's equal room in his peaceable kingdom for the Blow's chirpy new wave, Alela Diane's dusky folk, electronic ""library"" music, and Eritrean field recordings. Beyond simply being a sequence of miscellaneous songs that he likes, however, McGonigal seems here to have hand-picked a collection of performers to whom he feels some deeper connection-- either through friendship, personal history, or simple geography-- which gives the compilation an added sense of intimacy and unsuspected continuity.
    </p><p>
<em>Yeti</em> is published out of Portland, Oregon, so it's unsurprising that this collection is weighted heavily toward acts from the Pacific Northwest, several of whose careers have not progressed much beyond their MySpace pages. Nevertheless, tracks like ""Azalea"" from Portland's enigmatic Ghosting and ""Blood Is Clean"" by Valet (aka Honey Owens from Jackie-O Motherfucker) are captivating discoveries, while Destroyer's two tracks-- both of which appeared on the 1997 self-released cassette <em>Ideas for Songs</em>-- find Dan Bejar operating in an almost Daniel Johnston-like solo melodic stupor. Also stellar is ""Music for El Dorado"", a homespun duet between folk eccentric Michael Hurley and Tara Jane O'Neil which was recorded in a friend's Portland kitchen, and ""She Who Makes Dogs Shiver"", a raucous post-grunge growl from Ohio's We March, one of the few tracks here that harkens back to <em>Chemical Imbalance's</em> noisy heyday. 
    </p>
<p>
    Another of McGonigal's biggest recent passions has been pre-war gospel blues-- <em>Yeti</em> is scheduled to publish his <em>Field Guide to Gospel Blues</em> sometime in the near future-- and here he includes Reverend E.W. Clayborn's stunning ""God Is Riding Through the Land"". Equally rousing is ""How Much I Owe"", a 1955 performance from family-gospel act Radio Four, which McGonigal admits he added in part out of resentment that nuevo post-punkers Radio 4 have gotten away with borrowing the group's name. And though there are naturally several clunkers that drag down the compilation's momentum--such as Somos Marquis Homos' written-and-recorded-in-one-day muddle ""Down and Out in Madrid and Barcelona""-- there are at least as many that could easily find ways to sneak into your daily routine. For further evidence of this set's inspirational possibilities, one need look no further than the gorgeous alternate mix of Califone's ""The Orchids"", a chance hearing of which might encourage a further generation of song traders to begin an avid search beneath all of <em>Yeti</em>'s newly upturned stones.

    The coolest thing about the first two albums of
    bludgeoning math-metal instrumentals by Norwegian trio Noxagt is that they were
    made without a guitar. Nils Erga's hard-sawing viola could certainly sound like
    a guitar, and sometimes like an actual viola, but mostly it spewed an
    unidentifiable mix of winding screech and stubbly drone over Kjetil D.
    Brandsdal's earth-digging bass and Jan Christian L. Kyvik's precision drum
    pummel.</p><p>
    The aesthetic shift on the cover of Noxagt's self-titled third album-- instead
    of shadowy Nordic imagery, we get a pinup of ripped buttocks in band-logo
    underwear-- suggests something has changed. Something has: Erga has been
    replaced by guitarist Anders Hana, Brandsdal's bandmate in jazz-noise
    juggernaut Ultralyd. Like the oddly blunt cover art, Hana announces himself
    immediately. The album-opening ""Histrionix"" begins with his
    blistering, right-angled chords, the kind of classically straight move Erga
    generally avoided.</p><p>
    Yet the overall effect of this key lineup change is smaller than one might
    expect. Certainly Noxagt's sonic affinities are clearer than before: the
    triangular formulas of Oxes and early Don Caballero, the hyper prog of Ruins
    and Lightning Bolt, and the dark crescendos of Scandinavian metal are all more
    discernible here, mostly due to Hana's simpler, riff-bending style. But the
    trio's essential elements-- lumbering rhythms, bombastic crashes, a mean cross
    of tight pound and blurring volume-- remain powerfully intact.
    </p>
<p>
    On ""Wall's End"", Hana's weighty noodlings recall Ian Williams'
    heavier moments, while Brandsdal and Kyvik plod forward like a B-movie robot
    leaving city-sized footprints until his batteries run out. The exploratory
    ""Soft Sugar"" meanders under Hana's reverberating slashes until a
    thunderous Brandsdal loop forges an atmosphere that Hana rolls through like a
    gathering storm cloud. Later, the 12-minute ""Impious One"" is Noxagt
    at its most symphonic. Here, Hana's messiest feedback sprays noise over the rhythm section's pooky lurch.
    </p>
<p>
    The only real misstep on <em>Noxagt</em> is ""Ninety Parallels Ago"", a
    slow-motion crawl that attempts momentum through lunging
    pauses, but never quite gathers steam. Still, Noxagt's musical gravity is so
    alluring that even its rare lulls feel earned and strangely hypnotic, like the
    sweaty bliss of a heavy-legged jog after a marathon workout.
    </p>
<p>
    It also doesn't hurt that the best track immediately follows: The algebraic
    ""Coefficient Ascender"" launches full-speed into a metal-noise
    maelstrom, with the trio sprinting up its own wall of sound like a waterfall in
    reverse. Heavy with black rhythm yet shining with vivid noise, the track offers
    a nutshell of this daunting group's past and future, both of which remain
    blindingly bright.

    Listening to Long Island's As Tall as Lions, I couldn't
    help thinking the band must feel caged in by its tour
    itinerary of small clubs. On their self-titled, sophomore release, ATAL's polished pop sounds like the work of a band starved for its
    moment in the spotlight. Aided by producer Steven Haigler, who engineered and
    mixed several Pixies albums, the band sounds huge. His labor-intensive approach
    to recording-- loads of minute sonic detail and layers of overdubs-- creates a
    rich tapestry of sounds, but it also comes across as smoke-and-mirrors, a
    flashy package more dazzling than the songs it dresses up.</p><p>
    That said, singer Daniel Nigro and his vocal
    pyrotechnics have been compared to Jeff Buckley-- particularly on the stale soul of album-seller ""Love, Love, Love (Love, Love)"". Like Buckley, Nigro reaches for expressive heights
    and never shies from falsetto, but his register is closer to an emo-whine
    than a shimmering croon. As airy as his vocals are, his lyrical musings are
    equally weightless. Whether finishing phrases with cursory Spanish in
    ""Song for Luna"" or lamenting ""even when I find the love, it's
    fake/ And everything I want to touch would break"" on opener ""Stab
    City"", Nigro's words are confined to the horse-blinded scope of teenaged
    feelings. And when he sings lines like, ""I'm an anthropophobiac/ A wolf
    from the steps/ With pills in my coat/ And wine on my breath,"" it's like a
    game of telephone with Nigro channeling Chris Martin channeling Thom
    Yorke.</p><p>
    Like Coldplay, ATAL trade in the emotional
    sucker-punches of soaring choruses and crushing crescendos. The album's best
    song, ""Ghost of York"", explodes with an insidiously catchy chorus and
    monstrous guitar chords. It's an alluring song, but with its galloping rhythm
    section, twinkling guitar arpeggios, and on-a-dime stops and starts, it sounds
    deliberately constructed to fit neatly into the landscape of modern rock radio.
    And these days, that's not the place to be looking for inspiration.

And she's right-- it's totally unavoidable. The guitar's way lower in the mix, and King has a singing voice that's...nice. The trouble is, that's about all it is. Even multitracked to high heaven, <em>...Until We Felt Red</em>'s conspicuous new breathy vocals hit like a half-pound handful of goose down-- a significant change from how King used to nimbly pummel percussive delicacies from her collection of guitars.</p><p>
    On previous album <em>Legs to Make Us Longer</em> King dabbled at the palettes of guitar colorists from Michael Hedges to Jim O'Rourke and highlighed her strengths (ornate fingerpicking, sedate slide electric, insistent slaps at six strings and body alike). But <em>...Until We Felt Red</em>'s suggestive title hints that King's facing down some perverse embarrassment over the assets that brought her to our attention in the first place. Her nascent wordiness, limp experimentalism, evident avoidance of high-wire guitar kung-fu, and this record's violent troughs and scant peaks make it a ""new direction for Kaki King"" and a fairly serious disappointment.</p><p>
    Originality remains a weak suit for King. That she's always borrowed heavily from 1990s Chicago post-rock explains Tortoise appendage John McEntire's involvement (as producer and performer) here. ""You Don't Have to Be Afraid"" is a gorgeous-if-familiar cache of Gastr del Solian compositionettes quilted together by a single quilt-worthy lyric (""You don't have to be afraid of the pain inside you""). Sadly, that doesn't stop her from cooing the sentiment for eight long minutes.  On ""Goby"", featherweight cymbals and a loping bass carry Kaki's electric guitar ever closer to Tortoise's <em>TNT</em> territory.
    </p><p>
    ""First Brain"" pits flighty acoustic against faraway trumpet but nobody wins. Stabbing at smoky jazz club croon is ""I Never Said I Love You"", with King's lithe arpeggio runs and bouts of manic, distorted chords fighting a big McEntire drum kit and her untight grasp on vocal pitch. Sans lyrics, ""Soft Shoulder"" wins by doing well what Davids Grubbs and Pajo have done before: put five or six picturesque guitar tracks over post-rock drums and an egg shaker. Call it ""undislikable."" And ""Gay Sons of Lesbian Mothers"", the album's softronica cooldown, should've been on somebody else's record entirely.
    </p>
<p>
    It's strange, though, about this new Kaki King. Occasionally, her inelaborate poetry says everything all at once. Here's ""Second Brain"" in its entirety: ""Ten years, 2000 stomach aches/ If I get one every other day/ Are we to have another century of guitar/ When the best instrument in the world is still the piano?"" This is whispered atop a lush bed of thumb piano and the acoustic antique King's straining to outgrow. Here among the album's strongest moments, King's attempt to musically move along is just another opinion about why we cling so to the classics. And she's right again.

    For a few years now, the Decemberists' stagey, hyperliterate folk-rock has played well at indie labels Hush and Kill Rock Stars.
    The quintet has occupied a small community-theater space with gleefulness
    and confidence, but now it's accepted a scholarship to Capitol Records,
    which means a larger stage and a bigger audience. Can the band still project, or
    will its voices be lost in a cavernous auditorium, rejoined only by
    crickets and barely stifled coughs of boredom? Will nine-minute mariner
    epics play in Peoria?</p><p>
    Given the band's graduation from minor to major leagues, <em>The Crane Wife</em> may prove to be the most
    crucial record the Decemberists will release in their lifetime.
    Fortunately, their fourth album further magnifies and refines their strengths.
    Winsomely balancing frivolity and gravity, the Decemberists assemble an oddball
    menagerie of the usual rogues and rascals, soldiers and criminals, lovers and
    baby butchers-- but they've got a lot more tricks up their sleeves than previous
    albums had hinted. <em>The Crane Wife</em> employs
    an impressive variety of styles and sounds to tell Meloy's imaginative stories: There's the band's usual folk-rock, honed to an incisively sharp point, but
    they also deploy a smuggler's blues (""The Perfect Crime""), a creepy lullaby
    (""Shankill Butchers""), a Led Zep stomp (""When the War Came""), and, perhaps most
    divisively, a multipart prog track (""The Island"") that stretches well past the 10-minute mark. No epic chantey this time, though.</p><p>
    Meloy's inventive
    songwriting is the binding force, emphasizing character but remaining ever in thrall to stories,
    savoring the way they always play out to the same conclusions. Along with the
    homosexual undertones that have informed Decemberists songs from every album,
    he jettisons most of the archetypes that inspired <em>Picaresque</em> and cuts his characters loose in their own tales. They
    still do what they're fated to do-- the thieves thieve and run amok, the lovers
    love and die tragically, the soldiers soldier on and pine for peaceful homes-- but
    they seem to do it more out of free will than authorial design. 
    </p>
<p>
    Meloy focuses mainly
    on matters of war (""But O did you see all the dead of Manassas/ All the bellies and the bones and the bile?"") and love (""No, I lingered here
    with the blankets barren/ And my own belly big with child""). On the duet
    ""Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then)"", Meloy plays the part of an errant, possibly
    dead Civil War soldier while singer-songwriter Laura Veirs cameos as his
    ""sweetheart left behind."" It's <em>Cold</em><em> </em><em>Mountain</em>
    writ poignantly small, its sweet, wordless chorus perfectly life-size. Lumbering
    menacingly, the martial march of ""When the War Came"" smells of gunpowder and
    singed hair, although it sounds like it's anchored in Neverland despite trying
    to comment on real-world events. 
    </p>
<p>
    Meloy's taletelling will always define the Decemberists, but
    <em>The Crane Wife</em> puts as much weight on
    the music as on the lyrics, and here the band gels
    into a tight, intuitive unit. The musicians give each song a particular spark and character, not
    just reinforcing the lyrics but actively telling a story. They create a breezy
    eddy of guitar strums and piano chords to enhance a windborne melody and an
    undercurrent of peril on ""Summersong"", and the tragedy of ""O Valencia""-- any
    good song about star-crossed lovers must end in death-- is countered by the pep
    of the music, especially Chris Funk's ascending and descending guitar, which
    seems to take a particular glee in the inevitable denouement. The band isn't
    just able-bodied, but ambitious to boot. It makes the brainy prog of that
    monster second track, a distillation of the musical reach of their 2003 EP <em>The Tain</em>, sound like a natural extension
    of their base sound. They troll confidently from the rumbling overture and
    heated exposition of ""Come and See"" to the final rueful notes of ""You'll Not
    Feel the Drowning"". The song is chockablock with progisms-- organ runs,
    dampered cymbals, laser synths-- but manages to shake off the genre quote marks
    as the band jam with convincing menace.
    </p>
<p>
    Their range allows them to be precociously diverse, but
    everything fits naturally. <em>The
    Crane Wife</em> sounds like their most shapely album to date, resembling a
    spirited story arc in its set-up, rising action, climax, and resolution. In
    this structure the three title segments, despite essentially bookending the
    tracklist, form the album's thematic centerpiece, the music and story meshing
    gracefully and tenderly to retell a Japanese fable. ""The Crane Wife 3"" opens
    the album with a ruminative flourish as John Moen's drums push the sensuous
    thrust of the music and Meloy's delivery of the lines ""each feather it fell
    from skin"" colors the resignation of ""I will hang my head hang my head low."" It
    opens the album <em>en medias res</em>,
    setting up the subsequent story-songs as the narrator's rueful reminiscences.
    </p>
<p>
    ""The
    Crane Wife 1 and 2"" comprise a medley towards the album's end, starting slow
    and soft but gradually reaching crescendo in an unfurling finale, with Meloy
    breaking the word ""heart"" into multiple syllables over an unraveling drum beat.
    Restrained
    yet resonant, the song's (and album's) climax is a remarkable moment. As it
    segues into the rousing coda of ""Sons &amp; Daughters"", the Decemberists sound
    like a band that knows exactly where they're going and won't be satisfied until
    you come along for the trip.

    You can look at the
    eight-year gap between Sean Lennon's first and second album two ways.  On the one hand, his sporadic output
    speaks to the luxury and security of belonging to a family whose net worth increases
    every time ""Imagine"" comes on the radio. But the other, equally plausible
    explanation is that Lennon isn't the sort of artist who needs or wants to be in
    your face all the time, and who feels an ongoing musical career shouldn't be
    guaranteed by birthright.</p><p>
    While the personal iPod list
    he revealed recently in <em>Rolling Stone</em> displayed an affinity for Lightning Bolt,
    Lennon's directed his more brazen, aggressive impulses to other people's
    projects, be it Cibo Matto, Soulfly, or his mom's noise-rock band IMA. His own
    music, by contrast, is humble and resigned to a fault. Like his 1998 debut,
    <em>Into the Sun</em>, <em>Friendly Fire</em> rarely raises its voice above a breezy-listening
    lilt. However, the new album is noticeably bereft of the pancultural pastiche that
    marked <em>Into the Sun</em> as a typical late-90s Grand Royal product. In its place
    are baroque piano-bar melodies, foreboding Jon Brion string arrangements, and
    a palpable sense of empty-bed despair.</p><p>
    The stately presentation
    of these 10 songs belies their recurring theme: Being the son of a rock'n'roll legend and an avant-garde matriarch doesn't make your romantic life any
    easier. The word ""love"" appears in pretty much every track here, but it's often
    followed by a well-worn oppositional metaphor-- love is ""like a hurricane"" and ""like the ocean"" and ""such a dangerous game."" (The simplicity of Lennon's sentiments stands in
    stark relief to <em>Friendly Fire</em>'s accompanying DVD of elaborately costumed period-piece
    videos, featuring Lindsay Lohan, Asia Argento, Carrie Fisher, and much
    sword-fighting.) Lennon's delivery is as plain as his words; he knows his wispy
    voice isn't the most powerful instrument and never tries to stretch it beyond
    its modest parameters, punctuating his most salient points with backing
    vocalists (including former flame Bijou Phillips) and organ swells. It's a tactic
    that contributes greatly to the swooning allure of ""Parachute"", but <em>Friendly
    Fire</em>'s meditations on romance beg for more impassioned performances; catharsis
    too often takes a back seat to composure. The pervasive soft-rock-seductive ambience
    serves to create a distance between singer and subject; on the opening
    invective ""Dead Meat"", Lennon sounds like he's pouring his spiteful thoughts (""you
    just messed with the wrong team,"" ""you get what you deserve"") into a carefully
    worded e-mail when he should be growling them in your face.
    </p>
<p>
    But encouraging signs emerge
    in <em>Friendly Fire</em>'s closing act, which finds Lennon getting more restless and
    risky. Though it may be churlish to say that <em>Friendly Fire</em>'s best song is its
    only cover, fact is ""Would I Be the One""-- a Marc Bolan obscurity given a
    wondrous, space-age makeover-- is Lennon's most persuasive showcase, thanks to
    a gloriously glammed-out guitar solo and a ghostly harmonizing effect that
    lends his voice a desperation that's too rarely heard on the other songs. And
    if the closing track tells us something we already know-- that Lennon's ""Falling
    Out of Love""-- its mounting orchestral pressure and laser-beam Moogs force
    Lennon and his band out of its usual languorous gait and establish a game-plan
    for the future: less friendly, more fire.

Even the three or four-minuters are pared down to the simplest statement possible, as if she took a pile of short stories and cut them all to that moment where the protagonist decides, ""This life isn't working."" The recording is bare and Nastasia makes her voice plain-- not in a bad way, but to cut down on frills-- and where she's always sung in low tones, <em>On Leaving</em> finds her singing to an airless, empty room.</p><p>
    Nastasia's first three albums were overtly moody: 2002's <em>The Blackened Air </em>moaned with swamp gothic charm, and 2003's <em>Run to Ruin</em>, her greatest work, took its eight songs in vividly different directions, each track making a significant musical leap. But <em>On Leaving</em>-- Nastasia's first record for Fat Cat--<em> </em>pulls back on the experimentation. This time the arrangements are bare, with one exception: Every note of Steven Beck's piercingly sentimental piano strikes like pictureframe glass hitting the floor, almost cracking Nastasia's non-reveries. We know she's sad-- that couldn't be clearer-- and the songs work best when they skip to the reasons why: the striking memories of unidentified men in ""Jim's Room"", or the unsatisfied daydream of ""Our Day Trip"". And ""One Old Woman"" stands out like a shout: The only song where she raises her voice, it's also the record's only catharsis.</p><p>
    After <em>Run to Ruin</em>, it's difficult to hear Nastasia pull back to a songwriter-with-guitar style. One longtime listener remarked to me, with some disappointment, that he considers this ""a lyrics album."" As a smaller, closer record, it's successful. Nastasia has said that she feels most comfortable in the studio, recording pretty much live to tape, and letting each song rest on the record exactly the way it happened. Perhaps thanks again to recording with Steve Albini, it works for her here; even when she's most ambivalent, she's intriguing and immediate. But <em>On Leaving </em>is also closed-off and pensive, and sometimes just plain mopey. Where her last albums felt like they were imperceptibly spreading wings, this time she's stuck on the edge of a decision, and eventually the listener wants to give her a shove.</p></div>"|9478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9478-on-leaving/|7.5|Chris Dahlen

    Plenty of dudes by now know to keep their rock lineups separate from their singer/songwriter outings. Like, um Bright Eyes has Desaparecidos, Elliott Smith had Heatmiser, and even John Mayer fronted his Trio (BlackBerry?). Jeffrey Lewis, a comic book artist and singer/songwriter who emerged from New York's antifolk scene, juxtaposes both sides of the acoustic/electric divide while making the unholy transition from lo-fi geek-folkie to studio-shiny part-time punk on third album <em>City &amp; Eastern Songs</em>, recorded with brother Jack on bass and some vocals.</p><p>
    Why do we even bother? Such questions keep Jeffrey Lewis up nights. On rambling urban-bohemian fantasia ""Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror"", an L-train-riding Lewis asks Bonnie ""Prince"" or a sunglass-clad doppelganger whether e-mail interviews and polite critical notices merit turning our dreams into hobbies-- i.e., ""Is it worth being an artist or an indie rock star, or are you better off without it?""-- and receives his admittedly lame, possibly sexist answer only after getting violently fucked, Palace-style. This song is witty, self-aware, and preposterous, like Art Brut set loose on hipsterdom with back-porch acoustic guitars.</p><p>
    Other quiet moments are sometimes also affecting, as restrained fiddles and his ""Simpsons""-like squeaky-teen vocals help offset a digital-age sterility absent from early tape-hiss soliloquies like ""The Chelsea Hotel Oral Sex Song"" and ""Back When I Was Four"". Lewis's self-hypercritical narrator is constantly on the verge of failure, whether in comic books, music, or-- amid the Velvets' ba-ba-bas and scary octopi of ""Don't Be Upset""-- love. Like filmmaker Andrew Bujalski, Lewis is an auteur of awkward youth, and he shares Mike Skinner's neurotic gift for examining mundane details so obsessively that universal feelings emerge. ""You'll never again see the angle of the street that you saw from that window,"" Lewis muses on why-didn't-I-ever-mop-before reflection ""Moving"", then slides the key under the door.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, Lewis just can't keep his rock side separate. Here faster songs like ""Time Machine"" and ""Something Good"" come off as boneheaded garage rawk-- think Ben Kweller's sophomore album-- compared to the ramshackle Beat Happening happeningness of such predecessors as ""Another Girl"". Meanwhile, even the acoustic ""Singing Tree"" would've been better had it been, as one often hopes, an elaborate <em>Three Amigos</em> joke. On ""Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror"", Lewis imagines being a ""a natural artist you love or hate but can't deny"". While <em>City &amp; Eastern Songs</em> occasionally exhibits an undeniable talent unique enough that Lewis really should keep torturing himself for his art (sorry, Jeffrey Lewis's girlfriend!), it's really an album to love <em>and</em> hate.

    Let's all give Canada a standing ""O"". Our northerly neighbor's universal healthcare and <em>de facto </em>cannabis tolerance provide a beacon of hope for sinus-congested, stone-sober freelance writers everywhere, while its winters make even Chicago seem habitable. Just a few years ago, the nation confirmed Ross Perot's worst free-trade nightmare by insourcing all the good indie-rock gigs (a giant <em>not</em>-sucking sound). On debut album <em>This Cursed House</em>, an Ann Arbor, Mich. septet not coincidentally also called Canada prove that their knowledge of recent indietastic touchstones is more than name-deep.</p><p>
    In fact, they do little else.</p><p>
    Half the time <em>This Cursed House</em> sounds less like Canada (the country) than like Sufjan Stevens (the precious cabin-folkie). Beginning and ending with cricket chirps, the album bets huge on Upper Peninsula layers of harmony, cello, Rhodes, harmonica, banjo, melodica, glockenspiel, zither, flugelhorn, sleigh bell, wineglass (crystal), pad (paper), etc. (etc.). Of four instrumentals, one is based around a typewriter rhythm track. On ""Beige Stationwagon"", a library voice sadly scolds: ""He should have kissed his wife/ Like only a husband could."" It's the 2005 album of the year.
    </p>
<p>
    No worries, as the rest of the time Canada (the septet) also sound like bands from Canada (the country). <em>This Cursed House</em> reaches for the somber midwinter mood, Renaissance Faire plenitude, and unrestrained grandeur of Montreal's Arcade Fire, though not the melodic chops or Byrnean paranoia-- no head, just talking. ""Look to the Trees"" opens with swaying ""Neighborhood #2 (Laika)"" accordion, and ""Madisonville, KY"" is a ""Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles)""-like sprawling slowdance about the deep meaning of everyday objects, while ""The King's Ashes"" and ""Cold Mouse Winter"" share the Butlers' fascination with easeful death and freezing loneliness. So, it's also the 2004 album of the year.
    </p>
<p>
    Too bad it doesn't quite work that way. The stylistic tics of any pop musician, from the Beatles to Beyoncé, are rarely the stuff of year-end lists without everything else-- tunes, pacing, performance, and sometimes even persona-- falling perfectly into place. Underneath their arty gestures, Canada's songs are soft, gawky freshman-rock, <em>Parachute</em>-era Guster without the wit, bongos, or ""Mona Lisa"" (ahem). Canada's acoustic guitar strums, the real meat of <em>This Cursed House</em>, are pretty much rotten, squeaky with misplayed notes. So, too, the lyrics: ""Where were you?/ When the trees started to fall/ ...When the birds began to call/ ...When the weeds were grown tall/ ...When our houses were still so small""... oh dear God please kill us all. Look, Canada are young, they could still flesh out their ambitions on some future record, and one day we'll probably even discover this is all somehow Dubya's fault. In the meantime, blame Canada.

    When Pitchfork finally received a full-art copy of <em>Boys and Girls in America</em>, it came with a Hold Steady coaster, a wink at the received logic that Craig Finn and his cohorts are members of ""America's #1 bar band."" That's an ill-fitting tag for a couple of reasons; first, because the vast majority of the bars in the U.S. feature DJs and jukeboxes not bands-- let alone ones as unique and powerful as the Hold Steady.</p><p>
    Second, and more importantly: Although the characters in the Hold Steady's beery tales are big drinkers, you can't imagine many of them bellied up to a bar. That sort of drinking-- introspective, sometimes done alone, indoors-- is the antithesis of the imbibing in Hold Steady songs. <em>These</em> characters are drinking at apartment parties, at festivals, in fields, in cars. In ""Stuck Between Stations"", the protagonist and his friends ""drink from [a] purse""; ""Massive Night"" has the boys ""feeling good about their liquor run""; and in ""Party Pit"" the female character is ""gonna walk around and drink some more."" They're not reflective or nostalgic, and when frequent Finn heroine Holly is contemplating the past, it's with regret she can no longer get as high as she used to.</p><p>
    So it's no wonder that critical darlings the Hold Steady aren't exactly indie rock heroes. Marginalized to that world almost by default-- radio and video are, for the most part, unkind to new rock bands not targeted at high-schoolers-- the Hold Steady craft classic rock-indebted music that would sound better sandwiched between <em>Born to Run</em> and <em>Back in Black</em> than <em>Illinois</em> and <em>Tigermilk</em>. In other words, the more likely you are to use music as a social lubricant than as a social balm, the more likely you are to enjoy the Hold Steady.
    </p>
<p>
    And if you dislike this band, you wouldn't be alone. After years of making detail-heavy music with both Lifter Puller and now the Hold Steady, Craig Finn enjoyed a critical breakthrough last year with the divisive <em>Separation Sunday</em>-- a loosely conceptual album based around a trio of characters named Charlemagne, Gideon, and Holly-- which wowed critics with its back-alley poetry and willingness to reach the cheap seats, but left many listeners cold over Finn's gruff sing-speak vocals and his band's tendency towards licks rather than grooves.
    </p>
<p>
    On <em>Boys and Girls</em>, some things have changed that will make the band more palatable to doubters yet could disappoint <em>Separation Sunday</em> fans: Finn sings more than speaks, and his lyrics have a big-picture approach, allowing listeners to fill details of their own lives into the songs rather than be required to commit fully to those of his characters. Putting less emphasis on lyrical detail than in the past, Finn claims in opener ""Stuck Between Stations"", a paean to poet and suicide-victim John Berryman, that ""words won't save your life""; later, on ""First Night"", he writes that ""words alone can never save us."" It's the difference between working more in character, creating a low-rent version of street and suburban life, and creating songs that, as Pitchfork's Stephen Deusner observed, ""Finn's characters might want to listen to.""
    </p>
<p>
    One way in which Finn does this is by ratcheting up the force and power of the music, layering guitar and trebly keys and multiple hooks on top of one another like a mid-1970s E Street Band or an E-boosted Happy Mondays. It's rock'n'roll before it was ashamed to do either, and unlike on past efforts, lyrics can sometimes be summed up by lines that approximate the effect of a chorus, even if they're presented more like a thesis statement: ""I've had kisses that make Judas seem sincere,"" ""When they kiss they spit white noise,"" the aforementioned ""Gonna walk around and drink some more.""
    </p>
<p>
    The lack of specificity also means Finn is acknowledging the universality of his themes, which-- although he's still mostly writing about the Twin Cities-- reflect the experiences of kids across the country. Whereas Finn's spiritual predecessors, Bruce Springsteen and Jack Kerouac (whose <em>On the Road</em> lends the album its title), romanticized the open road and the possibility of escape, his characters travel not to start again or get away but as a diversion, as on ""Chillout Tent"", in which a pair of kids so desperate for something big to happen in their otherwise humdrum lives-- he on his ""first day off in forever, man"" and she on a break from her studies-- awkwardly try to squeeze as much decadence as possible into a single afternoon.
    </p>
<p>
    Finn is less a 21st century Springsteen than he is an American Jarvis Cocker; he's the poet laureate for the U.S.'s have-nots in much the same way the Pulp singer was for the UK's common people in the 1990s. Unlike Cocker, however, Finn doesn't write angrily, perhaps a telling indication that the stereotypically British self-loathing is equitable to the ""colossal expectations"" and lack of discipline of the boys and girls in America. Just as one wouldn't imagine Cocker writing escapist fantasies such as ""Chillout Tent"", nor would Finn pen something as bitter as ""I Spy"".
    </p>
<p>
    In a sense, however, this album, thematically, is as self-aware as Cocker's work at his height of fame-- the ambitious, zeitgeist-grabbing <em>Different Class</em> and hangover album <em>This Is Hardcore</em>. But rather than moan about too many nights on the tiles, Finn channels his diminishing energy into characters older and younger than himself: His epitaph for Berryman (""he was drunk and exhausted but he was critically acclaimed and respected"") and Holly's laments over stoner burnout in ""First Night"" could both be read as autobiographical.
    </p>
<p>
    They could also be seen as a lament for the type of music Finn's making, the straightforward arena rock that, these days, often settles for critical acclaim and respect rather than connecting with lots and lots of people. For all of Finn's holding his lyrics at arm's length here, he remains one of the best writers in rock, demonstrating grit and spunk and wit and intelligence in each track. Unlike many of those who've translated big, arena-ready guitars into arena-sized audiences, Finn doesn't resort to confidently sung platitudes like ""It's a beautiful day!"", ""Look at the stars/ See how they shine for you,"" or ""I'm not OK."" He not only has a commanding, rousing voice but he also says something <em>worth hearing</em>, displaying gifts for both scope and depth that are all too rare in contemporary rock-- indie or mainstream.

    In recent interviews, Ludacris has been talking up <em>Release Therapy</em> as his classic album. The problem with that idea is Luda already made his great album six years ago: <em>Back for the First Time</em>, the first Ludacris album, isn't a classic album in the traditional sense; there's no tortured introspection or narrative arc or grand thematic sweep. It's a unique record in that it managed to be one of the best rap albums of the decade without ever reaching for anything. The album's construction goes something like this: banger, banger, banger, skit, banger. But as a collection of nervous, twerked-up blip-stomp riots, it's pretty much unparalleled. Luda's stutter-growl navigated Shondrae's jittery electro booms with a preternatural authority, and he managed to pull off violent threats without ever giving the impression that he took himself the least bit seriously.</p><p>
    But every one of Ludacris' four follow-up albums, including <em>Release Therapy</em>, abandon that seamless banger-parade setup for a dubious grab-bag of bangers, attempted bangers, ill-conceived life-is-deep ""serious"" songs, bad jokes, and ooky sex-jams. He's maintained elite status mostly by saving up his best material for guest appearances on other people's songs. On his own albums, he mostly stopped doing what made him great a long time ago.</p><p>
<em>Release Therapy</em> is probably Luda's best album since <em>Back for the First Time</em>, but it's not like that's saying much. For almost the first half of <em>Therapy</em>, he keeps his aim straight and ambitions low, wrapping that hyperactive rasp around a string of queasy synth burbles. ""Girls Gone Wild"" is the sort of track the Neptunes don't often make these days, a great example of the farting spaceship-electro clatterfunk on which they built their name. On ""Ultimate Satisfaction"", Luda gets some serious bounce back into his flow, riding the fuck out of Rich Skillz' streaky, damaged synths. But Luda's not as funny as he once was, sometimes even veering off into complete nonsense: ""Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis/ Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius."" Still, it's encouraging to hear him trying to breathe fire again.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, it doesn't take long for everything to go to shit: ""End of the Night"" is a wishy-washy saccharine sex-jam duet with Bobby Valentino, the sort of middling for-the-ladies fluff that threatens to derail damn near every high-profile commercial rap album of the last couple of years. Luda finds unexpected ways to flex his wit on the track (""Let's get it poppin' like Orville Redenbacher""), but he can't do anything with a track this fiercely boring. ""Woozy"", the next song, goes wrong in all the exact same ways, wasting R. Kelly on a plinky smooth-jazz nonentity. Later on, Luda sadly tries to get conscious, venting about the nine-to-five he doesn't have over cheesy nerf-metal guitars on ""Slap"" or trying his hand at fake gospel on ""Freedom of Preach"".
    </p>
<p>
    The weirdest misstep, though, is ""Do Your Time"" a well-intentioned track dedicated to people in prison. Here, Ludacris recruits three notorious former convicts (Beanie Sigel, Pimp C, and C-Murder), all of whom deliver terrifyingly vivid depictions of frustration and impotence but are forced to play backup to Luda's own ill-advised ranting. Bearing in mind that Ludacris has never been to prison, it's hard to know what made him think he was the right guy to put this thing together. When he goes the positive route, he just sounds confused: ""Give my eyes to Stevie Wonder just to see what he's seen/ But I'd take them right back to see Martin Luther's dream."" Huh? Only on ""War With God""-- a charged-up fuck-you to an unnamed opponent who sure seems to be T.I.-- does Ludacris really unleash his id, clamping down on his words like a pit bull over a gorgeously woozy soul beat.
    </p>
<p>
    All those interviews indicate Ludacris is worried about his legacy, and that's the sort of thing that leads to sad attempts at heartfelt uplift. He does his best work when he's not thinking about posterity, and that might explain why he's constantly spitting fire on other people's songs. Luda comes a lot harder on <em>Pre-Release Therapy</em>, the mixtape he released with DJ Green Lantern a few weeks ago. Without pressure to make a statement, he cuts loose and destroys an hour's worth of other people's songs. It's not built to last, but it'll be on my iPod a lot longer than the finished product.

    And so Mansun's epitaph is written: ""Nobody cares when you're
    gone."" But no, dear Mansun, we do care-- why else, in the year 2006, would
    we spare a moment (or 500 words) to consider a band that's been defunct for
    four years and barely registered even as a Britpop footnote on these shores?
    Maybe it's that Mansun's lavish rendering of razor-on-wrist solipsism with
    conceptual bombast seems oddly prescient to the current emo/prog crossover, or
    maybe it's just the void created by three years without a new Radiohead record.
    Whatever the reason, it feels like a fortuitous time to reassess another UK
    band from the 1990s that broke free of Britpop's straitjacket conformity to
    pursue their own dystopian vision, even if Mogwai ridiculed them for it.</p><p>
    Mansun's 1997 debut <em>The Attack of the Grey Lantern</em> emerged right before Oasis' champagne supernovas flamed out into Coldplayed complacency. It entered the UK charts at number one, but it's quite possible the band's limited sales in America were comprised mostly of confused mall goths who thought they were purchasing Marilyn's latest. Of course, Mansun weren't paying lip service to Charlie as much as the Verve, whose 1992 single ""A Man Called Sun"" allegedly gave the band its name, and whose swirling, rhythmic psychedelia reverberates through
    still-powerful early signatures like ""Wide Open Space"" and ""The
    Chad Who Loved Me"". ""Taxloss"" seems to encapsulate Mansun's opposition and
    adherence to Britpop tropes, taking the Beatles' ""Taxman"" as its source text while cranking up the cynicism and psych-funk groove, but with just enough reverence for the original to
    show they weren't totally taking the piss.</p><p>
    But even <em>Grey Lantern</em>'s widescreen vantage provided scant preparation
    for 1998's <em>Six</em>, a <em>Kid A</em>-sized curveball where Mansun essentially
    turned into the Britpop Mars Volta, compacting infinite, incongruous song
    fragments into eight-minute suites that were exhilarating and exhausting in
    equal measure. But its unwieldy material is ill-served by <em>Legacy</em>'s
    non-chronological sequence. Aside from stand-alone single ""Legacy"" (a
    glistening anti-love song that should've become Mansun's
    ""Wonderwall""), <em>Six</em> is mostly represented by awkward
    abbreviations: the Arthur Baker single mix of ""Six"" excises the
    track's manic middle section and instead piles on distracting backing vocals
    and drum machine fills, making the song's mantra of ""life is a compromise
    anyway"" seem especially ironic. The single edit of ""Being a
    Girl"" retains its hyperactive opening tract-- perhaps to emphasize that
    Mansun were doing new-wavoid power-pop six years before Franz Ferdinand-- but
    the song feels slight without its gorgeously glacial Eno-esque closing act. 
    </p>
<p>
    It could be the non-linear tracklist is supposed to create the same feeling
    of randomness as Mansun's records, or maybe the band just want to put material
    from 2000's undercooked <em>Little Kix</em> (<em>Legacy</em> opens with that
    album's prophetic ""I Can Only Disappoint You"") and the band's aborted
    fourth album on equal footing with their more lauded early work. Even so, the
    rather rote click-track rock of ""Getting Your Way"" and ""Slipping
    Away"" suggest the band was probably wise to call it a day. Mansun
    newcomers would be better served, however, by a straightforward reading of the
    catalog that would allow them to make better sense of the band's ambitions and
    evolutions, instead of having a string of <em>Six</em> tracks interrupted by the band's 1996
    debut single, ""Take It Easy Chicken"", a baggy flashback that's aged
    about as well as Shaun Ryder. But even with these dated digressions, <em>Legacy</em>
    offers up enough convincing evidence that Mansun's pomp can endure under
    different circumstances.

Silversun Pickups, named in     homage to a Sunset/Silver Lake liquor store, spurn the Beach Boys and Thrills     approach to California, channeling, instead, the weirder darkness of acts like     Autolux. <i>Carnavas</i>, the band's first full-length, comes off as something     of an aural spiderweb: glinty, silvery, and vaguely treacherous. Their spidery     technique for entrapping listeners is this: wrap them up in familiar noises     toward which they feel more-or-less favorably and count on imminent stupo</p>
<p><i>Carnavas</i> scores points for constructing dreamlike aural shrouds.     Those nostalgic for Smashing Pumpkins tunes of yesteryear will find them     nestled inside the minutes (and there are so many minutes) of ""Lazy     Eye"". Those desirous of music to play while gazing at Magic Eye pics will     appreciate the record for its fuzzy blur; it's possible that they'll even find     this album extremely rewarding, and find hidden, wonderful things in it, like     crosses or hearts, or whatever it is Magic Eye creators are putting in their     images these days.</p>
<p>Maybe it's a prereq for making this sort of racket, but Silversun     Pickups too often teeter into melodrama. Consider ""Future Foe     Scenarios"", which seems like it could be about a village raising fists to     heaven after plagues of something (Locusts? Boils?), dissolving into screams of     ""I must stop drinking"". And ""Common Reactor"", which also     winds up a screaming, terrifying display of pathos.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the music fails to justify the histrionics. Songs start out     exciting, drag on for too long, and/or become screaming. Lyrics seem like     they're poking fun at Corgan, or impersonating a high school version of him:     compare ""Rhinoceros"" (""Open your eyes-- to these I must     lie?"") and ""Tempo"" (""She said don't open your eyes/ Don't     open your eyes/ And said goodnight""). Words elsewhere are wholly     incomprehensible (""What was that scar situated from afar/ What was that     light integrated in your mind"" on ""Well Thought Out Twinkles"").     Other times-- OK a lot of times-- Brian Aubert's emo-boy voice gets to be too     much, worse than even Corgan's barely-tolerable nasal delivery. Girl parts,     offered by bassist Nikki Monninger, are welcome respite; also, she's way cute.     In the end, despite the band's valiant and respectable effort, <i>Carnavas</i> ends up too unfocused, too rambly, too boring to make any lasting impressions.</p></div>"|9428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9428-carnavas/|5.0|Rachel Khong

    I was first introduced to the Byrds in those ubiquitous 1980s television ads for
    Time/Life books. A flurry of iconic photographs from the 20<sup>th</sup> century spanning everything from presidential nominations to wars, famine, nuclear
    tests, moon landings, and celebrity glitz flashed by to ""Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)"" by the Byrds. That chiming 12-string, stopped by those harsh chords, the rush of the verses set
    against the placidity of the chorus-- I was maybe five or six, but, man, I wanted
    to know what that song was.</p><p>
    I found out soon enough-- my mother had the 45, a measure of
    how much impact the song must have had when it first came out in 1965, because
    she didn't own a lot of rock 45s. Years later, in high school, I found the 45
    in the basement and finally listened to the B-side, ""She Don't Care About Time"",
    a beguiling song that could have easily made the short trip to side A. There's
    something about that Byrds sound-- the original Byrds sound, before they went
    country-- that's beyond even the words that people have convoluted specifically to describe
    it, like ""jangle"" and ""folk-rock."" It's so clear, with that ringing, compressed 12-string chime, elementary drumming, and unique, floating harmony style.</p><p>
    I generally think of the Byrds as two bands. The first,
    which lasted for five albums, is the Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, Chris Hillman, Michael Clarke (and,
    initially, Gene Clark) group, which embodied
    that sound. You can't listen to much post-1965 rock without running into its
    influence sooner or later, and when something is descirbed as ""Byrdsy,"" it's likely this incarnation of the band that's being referenced. The second Byrds is something much
    less defined. It begins with the country-rock masterstroke <em>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</em>. It's fractious and never establishes a
    clear identity, but its influence is just as huge, even if its
    musical legacy is far more mixed.
    </p>
<p>
<em>There Is a Season</em>,
    the latest in a seemingly endless string of Byrds anthologies, splits its four
    discs evenly between the two distinct phases of the band and presents a strange
    mix of hit singles, album tracks, live material (including five previously
    unreleased recordings), and obscurities ranging from B-sides to songs that only
    saw their first release on reissues and the original 1990 Byrds box. The huge
    book comes with a lengthy and painstakingly detailed essay by David Fricke that
    tells the band's story as well as I've seen it written, and includes a bonus DVD
    with some (lip-synched) 60s TV appearances. But it's hard to tell what the
    audience for the set is, given that hardcore Byrdmaniax won't find much new
    sound here. It's sort of like a really big best-of set. 
    </p>
<p>
    That said, it's a well-chosen one, and it opens with some of
    its most enticing material: six songs the band recorded with Jim Dickson prior
    to the ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" sessions. The first of these, featuring McGuinn, Crosby, and
    Hillman as the Jet Set, reflects the trio's adoration for the Beatles in its
    composition but is basic folk in its arrangement. The next two, both
    recorded after drummer Clarke and troubled singer Clark joined the
    band, establish the Byrds sound, with the 12-string electric guitar and
    those unique two-part, three-voice harmonies. These tracks became the band's
    first single, released on Elektra under the name the Beefeaters, a tag
    chosen by Elektra head Jac Holzman in the hopes he could align the group with the British
    Invasion. Thankfully, the single flopped and they weren't stuck with the name. 
    </p>
<p>
    The first songs from the newly christened Byrds-- ""Airport Song"", ""You Movin'"",
    and ""You Showed Me""-- simmer with creativity, refining the Beefeaters-era sound and expanding
    its boundaries. ""You Movin'"" even hints at the band's forays into psychedelia
    with its manic guitar solo. But it's ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" that
    truly launched the band-- and helped make the British Invasion a two-way exchange. Bringing Bob Dylan to a much larger audience than he'd had
    previously, it's two perfect minutes that seemed
    to map out a way forward for U.S. guitar pop.
    </p>
<p>
    The rest of the songs on Discs One and Two are remarkably
    uniform in their brilliance and accessible risk-taking. ""I'll Feel a Whole Lot
    Better"", ""The World Turns All Around Her"", ""All I Really Want to Do"", and ""Have
    You Seen Her Face"" are positively exquisite pop, still as arresting today as
    ever. ""Eight Miles High"", inspired by the band's collective obsession with John
    Coltrane's <em>Africa/Brass</em> album and
    Ravi Shankar, is one of psychedelia's opening shots, as it's hard to think of a
    song that did more to move the plot forward while also giving us a great,
    memorable tune. By the time the band's original incarnation was coming to an
    end, they were expertly balancing sophisticated pop with open experimentation,
    and it's nice to see songs like Crosby's
    elegant ""Triad"" and ""Lady Friend""-- included here along with mind-warpers like
    ""Dolphin's Smile"", which features McGuinn mimicking dolphin calls with his
    guitar.
    </p>
<p>
    The last two discs are much less even. I've never thought as
    highly of the band's country phase as their early material-- for one thing, with
    both Clark and Crosby gone, they'd lost their two most accomplished
    composers and a huge element of what made them distinctive-- although <em>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</em> is an excellent
    album and a milestone for its deft blending of country and rock. Gram
    Parsons is better represented on this box than he was on the original album,
    with three of his unused vocal versions (all previously available on the <em>Sweetheart</em> reissue) in the tracklist,
    including his own read of his excellent ""100 Years From Now"". 
    </p>
<p>
    The years after <em>Sweetheart</em>
    are the band's least known, and by 1969, McGuinn was the only original
    member left, ultimately assembling a country-rock band with Skip Batten, Gene
    Parsons, and longtime Byrds studio hand Clarence White. McGuinn admits in
    Fricke's liners that he likely should have stopped calling it the Byrds after
    Hillman left to form the Flying Burrito Brothers with Parsons, but there
    is good material to be found in the band's latter-day recordings. You just have
    to look harder. This final version of the band was best in a live setting, and
    it's fitting that there are a slew of live tracks on Discs Two and Three. ""King
    Apathy III"", from <em>Live at the Fillmore,
    February 1969</em>, has a nasty crunch uncommon in the band's repertoire, while
    later live dates spotlight White's prodigious guitar talent. They also
    unfortunately emphasize how much McGuinn benefited from having Clark and
    Hillman around to double his lead vocals.
    </p>
<p>
    Late material from the <em>Byrdmaniax</em>
    and <em>Farther Along</em> albums does little
    to encourage a re-examination of those albums, and a version of ""Roll Over
    Beethoven"" recorded for the <em>Banjo</em>
    soundtrack just highlights the fact that none of these guys came up playing
    basic rock 'n' roll. Two songs from <em>Byrds</em>,
    the band's unlikely 1973 reunion album that came together at Crosby's urging, are
    strangely good, showing Gene Clark's songwriting prowess virtually
    undiminished. Ultimately, though, the Byrds became lost in the very
    country-rock scene they helped create. 
    </p>
<p>
    The box's DVD is essentially a collection of artifacts and TV
    appearances that make it easy to see why a lot of bands found miming in front of spastic teenagers tiresome. McGuinn's
    ever-present rectangular sunglasses and Crosby's
    penchant for parkas are good for a laugh, but genuine live performances would
    have added more value. <em>There Is a Season</em>
    does a good job of gathering material from across the band's run, while also
    giving proper weight to the best of it. It's nice to have such a comprehensive
    overview, but it can't help being mostly redundant for the biggest Byrds fans,
    while also being a bit of an earful for newcomers.

That's OK: It's easy enough to talk about <em>Gang of Losers</em>, the band's third full-length in their little-over-a-decade-long career, sans synopses of 1995's <em>End of a Hollywood Bedtime Story</em> and 2003's <em>No Cities Left</em>.</p><p>
    Opening track ""Sinthro"" hints straightaway at a departure: It's a synthy, barely there intro, evocative of spooky scenery-- balding trees, mist, cricket noises-- that fools us into thinking the Dears are now into
    sparseness in lieu of lushness. But it doesn't last long: ""Ticket to Immorality"" perks things up immediately, and from there the album's punctuated by ""doots"" and ""oohs"" throughout. So <em>Gang of Losers</em> is a departure, of sorts, tightening <em>No Cities Left</em>'s too-sprawling landscape. One line goes, ""I hang out with all the pariahs,"" establishing the record's oddly proselytizing music-for-outcasts mood: weirdly dark, reminiscent of Radiohead (see ""Death or Life We Want You""), despite a singer who, let's be honest, basically sounds like a grittier Ben Folds.</p><p>
    Something remains theatrical about it all: <em>C</em>loser ""Find Our Way to Freedom"" swells with horns and glissandos, and ""No one should have to live all of their life on their own"" (from ""Ballad of Humankindness"") could be the album's tag line. There are no plot twists from here, no surprises. There's a song called ""You and I Are a Gang of Losers"", and subject matter's stuff like ""You and I are on the outside of almost everything"" repeated ad infinitum.
    The band is, if anything, more confident than ever, but the sound's grandiosity too easily verges on melodrama, a too-bold-to-be-believable misery. ""Whites Only Party"" touches on topics of race; ""Ballad of Humankindness"" discusses poverty; both seem bigger issues than the Dears are equipped to deal with. When Lightburn croons, ""I swear I swear I swear it to you,"" he's making repeat promises like the promise-maker who needs first to convince himself. <br/></p></div>"|9463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9463-gang-of-losers/|6.7|Rachel Khong

    On Hells on Wheels' third album, <em>The Odd Church</em>, there's a moment
    when the verse of ""Perversion"" careers into the chorus like a
    rollercoaster hitting a freefall. The music sounds like it's being pulled along
    by gravity as much as by the musicians themselves, who might as well be
    screaming and waving their hands in the air as they take that plunge. It's a
    thrilling passage, and the fact that the next five songs contain similar
    moments robs it of exactly none of its power. Living up to the band's name,
    side one of <em>The Odd Church</em> is full of great blasts of manic guitar and
    manic-er melodies, played with breakneck abandon by a group with the unlikely
    talent for referencing a range of influences-- the Pixies, the Ramones, Phil
    Spector, even Belle &amp; Sebastian here and there-- while sounding completely
    confident and vital. The Swedish trio sells their hooks by sheer force of will,
    ratcheting up the tempo and the drama as Rickard Lindgren and Åsa Sohlgren
    trade lines like Black Francis and Kim Deal playing Tracy and Hepburn.</p><p>
    After the feint of the subdued but sarcastic ""Heard You on the
    Radio"" and the self-propulsion of ""Perversion"" comes
    ""Alexandr"", about an admirably literate athlete; Lindgren laments
    ""Most people of acquired taste have the anatomy of walking canes""
    like he's Stuart Murdoch-- with all the biting wit and brainy humor that comparison
    implies. He and Sohlgren nail the coda of the time-traveling ""As We
    Play"" as if they're all too aware of the folly of band life: ""At
    least we didn't die away"" sounds like a determined dream they've not yet
    realized.</p><p>
    With Lindgren's scribbling guitar and Johan Risberg's pummeling drums,
    ""Come On"" ends the first side with an indie grandeur that's a perfect
    climax to a this-close-to-perfect run of songs. If <em>The Odd Church</em> had
    ended here, or if it had continued on in that same vein, it would be easy to
    extol its virtues unguardedly. But this isn't an EP, it's an album, and an
    ambitious one at that. Starting with ""At Least You Still Pretend You
    Care"", Hell on Wheels take a different sort of precipitous drop-off,
    abandoning their concise structures and headlong rush for a plodding pace,
    vague synth atmospherics, and rangier, less urgent songs.   
    </p>
<p>
    Well, maybe that's not exactly fair. The songs have their moments-- like the
    stuttering rhythms of the impressively obscure Yaz cover ""Tuesday"" or
    the disappointing realizations on ""Handing Over the Heart"" that love
    isn't really about ""Tearing off the shirt/ Cutting up the chest""--
    but they suffer their proximity to side one, which means it's impossible to
    hear them on their own merits. But that's praising with faint damnation. In
    truth, side two sounds fine, if less immediate, less tuneful, less frenzied.
    You wait for the crucial freefall, but get a bit of a letdown instead.

""When I Wake"" opens the record, as it did their previous self-released EP, with perky keyboard lines, crooning vocals, and glistening guitars. It remains the group's most accessible song, but ""On a String"" comes close. With a rubbery robotic beat and layers of bells that should sound repetitive, it ends up melancholic and graceful instead, nodding to soft-rockers and new-poppers of decades past with a bit of the detachment of their hometown's Sea and Cake. The appropriation here is so sharp it's almost scary, boiling the influences down to a whole that sounds distinctive, while still broad and catchy enough for casual listeners.</p><p>
    So it's a slap in the face when ""Water of the Gods"" kicks in with some lame sub-French Kicks bullshit guitar skiffle, wiping away the image of four boys in lab coats with test tubes full of expertly distilled pop. What's even weirder is that it's their newest song. ""Sisters"" may even be worse, with a drum loop so past its sell date it sounds like a Lex B-side. I won't even mention the disco song (""Twilight"").</p><p>
    It's wouldn't be fair to pick on the Changes for recycling the best work from their demo (four tracks) on their debut, but that material towers over much of what they've come up with since. The exceptions are saved for the end of the album: ""Such a Scene"" is one of the few moments where the band drops its placid demeanor, with a heavy dose of Cure-like minor key paranoia. ""In the Dark"" follows that up with more simmering soft rock, milking a few notes of piano and the hiss of a  mechanical high-hat for all the drama they're worth.
    </p><p>
    All which flows into ""Her, You, and I"", the band's oldest song that refuses to get old, swiping the clipped guitar from the intro to the Cure's  ""10:15 Saturday Night"" before quashing it like a cigarette butt to croon the album's sharpest melody-- half lounge-pop and half guitar-flexing rave-up. Most listeners will be jumping on now and will hear a record with at least five great songs, and really, the album is much stronger than its worst moments. It just doesn't bode so well when their pastiche seemed smirking and effortless before (neither of which are bad things) but sounds flailing now.

On headphones it's a claustrophobic nightmare, a petty collection of scrapes and wavering tones passed off as finished-- and only on wax, and loud, does it burst.</p><p>
    This Baltimore quartet, who pronounce their name ""Wet Hearts,"" are-- like the newer Boredoms, the New Orleans guitar-sustain devotees Belong, or the mouth-breathing, om-ing New Yorkers Double Leopards-- in search of a kind of transcendence through repetition and incremental adjustments. They find it in their own way: Though they allude, convincingly and often, to the Boredoms' <em>Seadrum/House of the Sun</em>, their best moments are their most processed-- long, humid, sustained tones and almost desultory, lagging, melodic progressions.</p><p>
    In one spot static, drenched in echo, cascades over the circled drum patterns spun out by Shaun Flynn; in another, ghostly drips fall as their gradually echoed pings of sound bounce down different registers, their colors changing as they gradually fade. <em>Heat Chief</em>'s third movement rises, dark and ugly-- all toms and guttural noise-- while the fourth and final is the complete opposite, morning light gradually filtering into a cave.</p><p>
    To say it plain, <em>Heat Chief</em> could've been brilliant-- it isn't on CD, or in headphones, or anywhere else its remarkably poor fidelity and mix are audible-- and on my half-broken, static-y stylus, comes pretty close. <br/></p></div>"|9375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9375-heat-chief/|7.2|Zach Baron

If only it were that simple. Though ""Chasing a Bee"" remains a setlist staple, the well-oiled, workmanlike Mercury Rev that routinely tours the European festival circuit these days bears scant resemblance to the six Buffalo film-school misfits that jolted an unsuspecting underground with 1991's <em>Yerself Is Steam</em>.</p><p>
    For a band that's weathered its share of Pink Floyd comparisons over the years, the parallels between the two bands' histories are uncanny: After two albums of turbulent but bracingly innovative modern psychedelia, Mercury Rev turfed freakish frontman David Baker (their wildcard Syd Barrett character) and put the reins in the hands of Donahue (the steely Roger Waters-like musical director), with guitarist Sean ""Grasshopper"" Mackowiak playing the dutiful David Gilmour foil.</p><p>
    Like the Flaming Lips, that other band Donahue played with from 1990-92, Mercury Rev would go on to define pre-millennial cosmic American music-- songs the size of canyons filled in with Neil Young-fragile vocal trembles, heavily treated string-section effects, and vulnerable lyrics contrasting starry-eyed wonder with cold hard truth. No surprise that the Rev and the Lips were occupying the same headspace, given that their respective breakthrough albums (1998's <em>Deserter's Songs</em> and 1999's <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>) were both recorded at Tarbox Studios in upstate New York under the production aegis of Mercury Rev bassist Dave Fridmann.
    </p><p>
    But where the Lips arrived at their creative pinnacle through a series of complex boom-box/parking-lot experiments, Mercury Rev got to theirs through a process of refinement and focus, one that continued through the more conventionally structured <em>All Is Dream</em> (2001) and <em>The Secret Migration</em> (2005). Rather than chart this chronology, the 2xCD best-of/rarities compilation <em>Stillness Breathes</em> deploys a randomized tracklist to reinforce the connections between Mercury Rev's early and current incarnations. Beyond an ongoing fascination with New York State history and mythology (the Coney Island Cyclone, the Catskill Mountains), what unifies the band's work is an undefined temporality-- Mercury Rev songs sound like 1942 and 1967 and 1991 and 2026, often all at once.
    </p>
<p>
    While the epochal ""Chasing a Bee"" may have lured in the UK shoegazer contingent-- at the 3:07 point, the song introduces the most startling, cardiac-arresting guitar squall laid to tape in 1991, <em>Loveless</em> be damned-- its most remarkable features are the choir-like chorus of ""la la la's"" and calming flute refrain that bravely withstand the punishing onslaught of distortion. And to belie the notion that Mercury Rev lost their capacity for chaos following Baker's departure, there's ""Empire State (Son House in Excelsis)"" from 1995's <em>See You on the Other Side</em>, the album that effectively mediates between Mercury Rev's early and later output. With its piano-tapped Brian Wilson melody and regal flute line slowly intensifying into a ferocious brass-blasted Sonic Youth-ish eruption, this staggering seven-minute epic represents Mercury Rev in Excelsis.
    </p>
<p>
    The other early 90s selections nicely complement the band's later material: The sentimentality of<em> Secret Migration</em> tracks like ""Diamonds"" and ""In a Funny Way"" are hardly surprising in light of the charming 1992 single ""Car Wash Hair"" or 1995's ""Everlasting Arm"", the band's first foray into avant-schmaltz. Even Baker's swirling ""Something for Joey"" anticipates the orchestral pop gushes of ""Opus 40"" and ""A Drop in Time"". But the second disc's wild assortment of ephemera makes it difficult to discern any kind of logical through-line; think of it as the equivalent of a behind-the-scenes feature on a DVD, cataloguing the various inspirations and research that go into the finished product.
    </p>
<p>
    The bonus disc's dearth of quality leftover originals suggests that Mercury Rev enter the studio with their album tracklists already finalized; the outtakes included here are either inconsequential (<em>All Is Dream</em>-era B-side ""Observatory Crest"") or amusing time capsules (""Clamor"", a document of the band's late-80s origins as a Mission of Burma by way of Cocteau Twins post-punk band called Shady Crady). Instead, the disc mostly focuses on Mercury Rev's experiments with other people's material, some of which amount to mere classic-rock karaoke (the Beatles' ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", John Lennon's ""I Don't Wanna Be a Soldier""), but several of which explore the Rev's interests beyond the standard rock canon, including showtunes (""I Only Have Eyes for You""), folk standards (Johnny Cash's ""Streets of Laredo""), and surrealist beat-poetry soundtracks (""So There"" and ""Deadman"", recited by Robert Creeley and Suicide's Alan Vega, respectively). 
    </p>
<p>
    Individually, many of these outtakes challenge this collection's ""Essential"" tag (particularly a woeful trip-hop take on James Brown's ""It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World"", on which guest vocalist Carmen Quinones lays on the soul-diva ad libbing), but taken as a whole, they provide an impressive overview of a band that isn't afraid to journey through the past to find a new way forward. As Baker sang on ""Chasing a Bee"": ""What once was lost, will never be found/ Keep spinning in circles until you break new ground."" So even if Mercury Rev's recent albums reflect a certain stasis and contentment, their music always carries with it the possibility that we'll soon see them on the other side.

    Evan Dando makes more sense as a story than as a singer. Start in the late 1980s, when Massachusetts was still the mightiest indie rock state in the union and Dando was just one member of bread-and-butter Boston punk act the Lemonheads-- and then fast-forward to the turn of the 90s, when he took control of the band and began to reshape it in his own image. Dando was a folkie and a country fan, and he'd fallen in love with the genial jangle of Australian indie; his punk roots receded and pop became the central focus. Result: 1992's <em>It's a Shame About Ray</em>, an album that sounds surprisingly good to this day; there's an easy-going slacker charm to it, a puppyish campfire feel that backs up every hook. (Plus: Juliana Hatfield on backing vocals.)</p><p>
    Bonus result: The band scores minor hits with the title track and a cover of ""Mrs. Robinson""-- and since the 90s alternative-rock gold rush is picking up steam, some folks at Atlantic Records start thinking. This Dando guy sure has an awfully square jaw, doesn't he? Long-haired, sensitive, deep voice, teenage girls think he's dreamy. Suddenly it's decided all around that Dando's going to be a massive alt-rock heartthrob who makes top-selling records, and the sooner the better. Unfortunately, Dando's smoking too much crack (literally-- dude smoked crack) to either object or deliver an album that actually backs those plans up. Result: Used CD bins full of 1993's <em>Come On Feel the Lemonheads</em>, a mix of half-decent songs and dippy cast-offs. (It's actually one of the <em>better</em> songs that includes these memorable lines: ""If I was a booger, would you pick your nose?/ Where would you keep it? Would you eat it?"")</p><p>
    After that, Dando enters rehab, releases one more record (1996's <em>Car Button Cloth</em>), and then seems to spend the rest of the 90s wandering around with an acoustic guitar, playing his lovely old songs like some kind of high-profile busker. And the folks at Atlantic Records, not having learned their lesson, decide maybe they can turn Juliana Hatfield into a heartthrob instead.</p><p>
    It's not as if Dando hasn't released records since then, but this one is a major step-- it's his first using the Lemonheads name in a decade. He's also rounded up a couple of former Descendents for his band (plus J Mascis for some guitar cameos, check), and he's promising a return to the old loud punk. And while this is most certainly <em>not </em>the old loud punk-- not for a second-- there's a half-kernal of truth in there somewhere: After all that time as the acoustic guitar-toting hippie, Dando's clearly having a blast playing rock again, solos and breakdowns and all.  And weirdly, <em>The Lemonheads</em> even sounds like an actual reunion, like a bunch of guys getting the old band back together in the garage. There's not the barest whiff off Dando accommodating new trends, or shocking us with what he's learned-- the band just jams loose and happy-- <em>It's a Shame About Ray</em> with more guitar and fewer worthwhile songs.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, the songs on this record aren't always much to write home about-- they may be more sophisticated than most in the band's past, but they also feel a lot plainer. (Also, country number ""Baby's Home"" is actively horrible.) This leaves just Dando's charm and enthusiasm to carry the weight, which, after a few listens, it starts to manage. On the tracks that really work-- ""Rule of Three"", ""Poughkeepsie"", or the part of ""December"" that just rewrites <em>Ray</em>'s ""Confetti""-- the band sounds wonderfully breezy. It's windows-down driving-in-summer stuff, and a nice nostalgic contrast to a lot of the more pinched and nervy sounds of today. (It's not a matter of time, either: Dando's songs felt nostalgic in 1992, too.)</p><p>
    So far as the Dando story goes, it's a treat to see him recapture the vibe he very nearly got famous on-- all the old tricks, just with more riffs and bigger amps. Plus, he's still genial and dippy: Everyone else writes angry songs about the Bush administration; his feel-good take on it is called ""Let's Just Laugh"", because, umm, ""We can never do anything about anything anyway."" He writes the same candied uptempo hooks, and he still takes his voice up into a higher register when he wants to create the illusion of the last verse of a song being more exciting. 
    </p>
<p>
    Most listeners with a soft spot for those early-90s Lemonheads records will get a good spin out of <em>The Lemonheads</em>; it's always good to see old friends and have them come off this happy and unchanged, even if you don't really need them in your life anymore. The bigger question is whether anyone else will be sold on it. The 90s throwback vibe says no-- who's itching for strummy power-pop these days, and why not just pick up <em>Ray </em>instead?-- but Dando's damned unprepossessing charm just might drag a few fun-lovers across the line.

    Do the math: 1981's 16-year-old boy is 41 years old today. Old enough to
    have his own 16-year-old. Maybe on Friday nights he lets the guy stay out late
    so his high school band can cover ""Young Till I Die"" in a VFW hall.
    Or maybe he covers something else, cause his dad <em>wrote</em> ""Young Till
    I Die"". The first-wave hardcore boys and girls are now grown and, like
    their parents, are out there insisting that their days were the best days, and
    their kids are now, like <em>their</em> parents once did, recoiling in horror.
    Who wouldn't cringe at Mike Watt, cruising in his beat-up van, palpably longing
    for his Minutemen days in <em>We Jam Econo,</em> or at the sight of the
    corpse-parade over at CBGB-- a dying rock club embalming itself with the
    flop-sweat of old men trying to act young again.</p><p>
    This kind of generational self-promotion is inevitable, and disappointing
    only in how it sucks the vitality out of the very music and era these guys
    would like to promote. Touch and Go dodged this quandary a few weeks back by
    throwing a big show in honor of their 25 years, and instead of talking
    endlessly about how great those years were, had some of the major figures come
    out and demonstrate.</p><p>
    Conspicuously not among those who reunited in salute of the label were the
    Fix, but it's no wonder; they saw hardcore as a movement coming apart as far
    back as 1982. They broke up that year, on New Year's Day. In their liners to <em>At
    the Speed of Twisted Thought, </em>they remember the era like so:
    ""Iconoclasm gave way to style and bands of punks became every bit as intolerant
    of dissent as the society and pop culture that we all purported to wage war
    against."" These days it's heresy to doubt the legend status of bands from
    this era, and the Fix's first single goes for upwards of $1,700 on eBay. Time
    has proved them more or less right.  
    </p>
<p>
    Still, New Year's Day 1982 was probably a little premature to call it quits.
    Fellow area stalwarts the Necros limped all the way to 89, and in the Midwest
    alone, Negative Approach, Articles of Faith, Hüsker Dü, and the Meatmen were
    all still going or yet to come. But the Fix were genre purists; <em>At the Speed of Twisted Thought </em>harkens not to 1981's Teen Idles or
    Minor Threat records, not the Necros, not even Black Flag, but one band only--
    Bad Brains.  
    </p>
<p>
    Tesco Vee apocryphally wrote, in an early T&amp;G fanzine, that the Fix
    ought to be known as the band that played ""at the speed of twisted
    thought."" Indeed: Craig Calvert, their guitarist, played impossibly fast
    but almost psychedelically, playfully ripping four-chord melodies across
    scales, squirting out bursts of noise between verses (Byron Coley writes in the
    liners that ""the Fix seemed to have an interest or a grasp or <em>something</em>
    on fundamentals""); like Dr. Know of the Bad Brains, he was a virtuoso cut
    loose, and one of only a handful of hardcore stringsmen able to play way faster
    than his own drummer. 
    </p>
<p>
    The Fix's Steve Miller couldn't sing for shit (Coley again: ""a kind of a
    ripped-throat formalism"")-- on his best days he was Guy Picciotto from
    Rites of Spring, on his worst John Brannon from Negative Approach-- but he
    figured out how to thrash early on. ""Off to War""'s chorus, which
    starts the next line before the last one's finished, is one of 1982's
    best-- ""Everybody goes/ Everybody fights/ Everybody goes/ Everybody
    dies""-- and it's underpinned by a rising bass line that obliterates the
    whole bridge even as it hits the end. ""Famous"" is note-perfect Bad
    Brains, down to rapidly possessed vocal and solid-state guitar tone, Miller's
    voice stripped raw, totally urgent nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
    The Fix were just a little off-- a few degrees off the orthodoxy, perverters
    of the ""style"" they so deplored in their peers. They're gone, and
    good for them for not coming back.

    The NYC-based art rock collective Ike Yard emerged during the waning days of the No Wave movement, eventually becoming most noteworthy for being the first American group signed to Factory Records and for the fact that bass player Kenneth Compton reportedly once dated Madonna. But now-- as part of an ongoing mission to illuminate all the dark, neglected corners of the post-punk era-- Acute Records presents <em>Ike Yard 1980-82 Collected</em>. This comprehensive overview includes Ike Yard's self-titled LP for Factory America, their earlier <em>Night After Night</em> EP, and a generous assortment of previously unreleased live and studio rarities. And though it would probably be inaccurate to declare Ike Yard's work to have been particularly influential, on this collection their music appears to have aged quite well, as many of their jittery, post-industrial rhythms closely anticipate the thuggish motions of contemporary acts like Black Dice or Liars.</p><p>
    Cribbing their name from a record sleeve in <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, Ike Yard sculpted a doom-laden experimental sound that drew heavily upon first wave Krautrock (particularly Can and Faust) and the post-punk dub maneuvers of PiL and Joy Division. Unlike No Wave's many unschooled or self-taught musicians, however, Ike Yard's Michael Diekmann and Fred Szymanski both had an academic background in music, studying Stockhausen and modern composition at the McColl Studio of Electronic Music at Brown. It's perhaps due to these academic origins, then, that much of Ike Yard's work matches their sinuous, bass-heavy grooves with a rather dry, formalistic precision. This sense of clinical detachment is often accentuated by Stuart Argabright's clipped, semi-spoken vocals, his monochromatic announcements often struggling helplessly to compete against the dark music's forceful technological currents.</p><p>
    Recorded virtually live with few overdubs, the <em>Night After Night</em> EP was originally released on the Belgian label Les Disques du Crépuscule in 1981. At this time the group were experimenting with various instrumental line-ups, and beginning to incorporate early Roland and Korg MS-20 drum machines with Argabright's live scrap metal percussion. Combined with Compton's loping, dub-inflected bass lines, the interactive rhythms of tracks like opening ""Night After Night"" or the instrumental ""Motiv"" contain the echoes of Miles Davis' edgy 70s jazz-funk as well as Can's shapeshifting beat action. But tracks like the clattering, dissonant ""Cherish"" give a better hint at the direction Ike Yard would soon take, as their sound grew increasingly dependent upon the stark, alien textures of their modular analog electronics.
    </p>
<p>
    This evolution is apparent immediately on ""M. Kurtz"" and ""Loss"", the opening tracks from Ike Yard's 1982 Factory LP. On these later tracks, the music's cell structure is completely governed by the group's overlapping synthesized rhythms, with all other sonic and lyrical elements rooted in the tiny cracks between Ike Yard's densely compacted electronic pulsations. The Expressionist propulsion of ""Kino"" is shrouded by black veils of dense insect noise, while the aggressive minimalism of ""Half a God"" updates Suicide, with its lyrics (""We hear the drums again and fall back in step again"") obedient to the music's martial gravity. One can only imagine what Madonna must have made of this onslaught.
    </p>
<p>
    According to Michael Diekmann's exhaustive liner notes, Ike Yard continued to write and record music at a ferocious pace following the release of their sole Factory album, but the group began to disintegrate before they could get the label interested in another release. This collection features four unreleased studio tracks, as well as an live track that was mixed live by New Order's Peter Hook while the two groups were on tour together. While these additional tracks do contain the occasional tantalizing song fragment or idea, they do little to improve upon the bulk of Ike Yard's slim discography, and will likely be only of interest to true diehards. Upon Ike Yard's dissolution in early 1983, the group's members went on to front various underground dance and hip-hop projects, but largely abandoned their collective's avant-garde techniques and innovations. And judging by the documents gathered on <em>1980-82 Collected</em>, this would seem to be our small loss.

    Pavement fans might recall a <em>Brighten the Corners</em>-era B-side called ""Westie Can Drum"", in which Stephen Malkmus actually sings, ""Westie cannot drum."" These days, it makes for a less gripping debate-- Steve West has given up on drumming altogether post-Pavement, opting instead to tackle lead vocals for the sextet Marble Valley. And, on the band's third album, <em>Wild Yams</em>, Westie and co. turn in an eclectic set of the sort of indie rock you'd expect from the Pavement camp: sturdy songwriting, loose playing, catchy melodies, and smartass posturing.</p><p>
    West makes for an interesting frontman. Though he never strains for the poetic opacity of Malkmus' lyrics, his effortless vocal delivery exudes the same oblivious confidence, like a hung-over college kid who rolls out of bed to ace the final without cracking a book.  Yeah, okay, so maybe he doesn't ace the test, exactly. But there's so much comedy in these songs, the guy deserves a little mercy on grading day. In ""Diary of a Stone Mason"", he hilariously scats before crooning, ""In the darkness, I rock out/ And angels cry."" On the mid-tempo divorce song, ""I Could Drink an Ocean"", he paints the scene with, ""I took my fist and punched it through the wall/ You grabbed the kids and drove them to the mall."" And on ""Fag &amp; Ah Light"", there's Westie at the pearly gates, sweating St. Peter's judgment (""Oh, no! My sins!/ Will I get in?"") atop bouncy vintage keys.</p><p>
    But if listeners can count on West's deadpan approach to silliness (and yep, they can), Marble Valley's music is a bit less predictable: One minute the band might take cues from heavy metal (""Dirty""), and the next they might be exploring the propulsive glories of motorik (""Sunshine Rayland""). Yet throughout <em>Wild Yams</em>, there remains one constant source of pleasure: terrible synths.  Check ""Computer Man"", on which West pulls out a strikingly Les Savy Fav-like lyric (""Everybody sad about tragedy, tragedy!/ Everybody talk about CPU capacity!""), before a Kraftwerkish analog synth line blossoms at the chorus.  (Let's see if we can't all do our part to make the future sound this much like the late 70s.)
    </p>
<p>
<em>Wild Yams</em> isn't going to change any lives, but when West croons about getting high in his dreams and playing a gig in a UFO on ""Eric the Viking"", you might get a laugh out of it. And that's not a bad thing, considering this shit makes angels cry.

Remixing is now as popular as ever, but file-sharing has     pushed it into a different realm-- less a retail-ready statement and more     something for the truly committed to track down.</p>
<p>That Hebden has never tired of remixes, and has done them steadily over the     years, is not surprising-- they seem to suit his aesthetic well.     His DJ mixes suggest the guy has good ears, the first qualification for a good     remixer. And despite his forays into improv and his Fridge roots in     instrumental rock, he's way schooled on genres (drum'n'bass, hip-hop) in which     the remix is long embedded. So this 2xCD set collecting highlights from the     remixes Hebden's performed and the remixes he's received is of more than passing interest,     since it's coming from a guy who's put a lot of thought into something     that can so often be rote.</p>
<p>If Four Tet's remixing of other artists has a defining characteristic, it's     that he tends to bring the disorienting psychedelic aspects of the track to the     foreground. Never a 4/4 kind of guy, Hebden likes to give tracks a shove, knock     them off balance, and see which remaining elements keep the forward momentum.     When he's at his best, and especially given a song I'm only so-so on to begin     with, Hebden contributions are actually an improvement.</p>
<p>His spin on Radiohead's ""Scatterbrain"" (re-titled     ""Skttrbrain"") strips away most of the instruments save skittering     two-step drums and what sounds like a recording of a drunken stumble through a     junk shop, letting Thom Yorke's voice float above the fray, weightless. Hebden also     transforms Madvillian's ""Money Folder"", as he chucks the loping     jazz-hop and replaces it with a dense assemblage of neo-electro synths that     crowd out the vocal and add a layer of anxiety. The makeover of Madvillian's     ""Great Day"" is even more dramatic, with sliding backward guitars and     indistinct fragments of percussion dropping the vocal into a bad film print of     a forgotten low-budget Hong Kong film.</p>
<p>Surprisingly effective is the epic 11-minute     mix of Beth Orton's ""Carmella"", an organic drag'n'drop collage that     turns snaky guitar and thrusting drums on a Joni Mitchell melody to transform     it into a pleasingly broken bit of electronic folk. In general, Disc One is a     good selection of Four Tet remixes, avoiding tracks where Hebden's love of the     heavy pour can overwhelm a delicate song, as it did on two awkward takes on     Juana Molina's ""Salvese Quien Pueda"" (not included here) released     last year.</p>
<p>The second disc, where Hebden is remixed, is less interesting. A number of     tracks come from kindred spirits who share Four Tet's aesthetic and perfer     inter-genre tweaks over rethinking the tracks' original purpose. Both Manitoba     and Koushik, for example, remix ""Hilarious Movie of the 90's"". The former's     version, with its sentimental vocal cup-up and fast-forward glitches, has a     certain emotional tug but no real arc; Koushik, meanwhile, spins gentle     indie pop in the Plug Research vein, complete with his voice and a new melody,     but it never gels. Rapper Percee P adds rhymes to two versions of ""A     Joy"" that have no real reason to exist. ""It's the legendary Percee P,     reppin' with my man Koushik,"" which ends the latter's remix, isn't the     type of phrase to send battle-ready opponents running. Still, of the 24 tracks     total included in these two discs, at least 10 compel repeat plays-- a pretty     good ratio as these things go. Four Tet is a remix true believer, which makes a     difference.</p></div>"|9450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9450-remixes/|6.8|Mark Richardson

    In some ways it's a small miracle that Sparklehorse's fourth
    album, <em>Dreamt for Light Years in the
    Belly of a Mountain</em>, is seeing the light of day. Five years in the making,
    it was hindered by Mark Linkous' professional and personal frustrations,
    depression, and his well-documented fight with drug addiction. He shied away
    from recording and playing live, moved to North Carolina,
    and worked piecemeal on this record. He revived one song from the sessions of
    his previous album, recorded a few with Danger Mouse, remixed an old B-side, and
    laid down some tracks alone in his home, playing all the instruments himself.
    The resulting collection should sound fragmented and disparate, its songs
    disconnected from one another. Instead, <em>Dreamt
    for Light Years</em> is a surprisingly unified whole as well as a powerful
    statement about death and life.</p><p>
    All the elements that have garnered Linkous a small, but
    loyal, cult audience are present on <em>Dreamt
    for Light Years</em>, and he sequences the album to make the most of the
    contrast. Sad, delicate songs like ""Return to Me"" and
    ""Morning Hollow"" abut brittle, abrasive rockers like ""It's Not So Hard"" and
    ""Ghosts in the Sky"" or damaged ballads like ""Mountains"". The opener and second
    track comprise a solid one-two punch: ""Please Don't Take My Sunshine"" is full
    of Beach Boys harmonies and gently skewed
    folk-rock, but ""Getting It Wrong"" counters that deceptive sunniness with
    dungeon-dark lyrics and vocals that sound like they're decaying in the air
    between the speakers and your ears. ""They're playing our song,"" Linkous sings.
    ""They're getting it wrong"". That simple, inspired lyric sums up the Sparklehorse aesthetic: disassembling a song to
    make it stronger, getting it wrong to get it right. Static and distortion rise
    up regularlyas noisy punctuation to tender songs, creating a sense of fragility
    as if the music could crumble at any second.</p><p>
    Delivering his despairing lyrics, Linkous alternates between
    his insectoid falsetto, blemished tenor, and melting moan, each of which sounds
    fragile and human on its own but all the more affecting for stumbling into each
    other. Coming after the garbled vocals of ""Getting It Wrong"", his unfiltered
    voice-- deep and mic'ed almost uncomfortably close-- sounds joltingly natural and
    almost too intimate, a telling transition on an album that alternately
    lulls and unsettles.
    </p>
<p>
    For someone who has a reputation as a hermit, Linkous collaborates
    frequently. <em>Dreamt for Light Years</em>
    features an impressive lineup of guests, but anyone searching for those contributions could be disappointed-- only Sol Seppy's backing vocals on ""Please
    Don't Take My Sunshine"" and ""Morning Hollow"" stand out, her crystalline voice
    beautifully countering Linkous' grainy drawls. Tom Waits' piano and Joan
    Wasser's violin on ""Morning Hollow"" and Steve Drozd's drums on ""It's Not So
    Hard"" have been wholly absorbed into the Sparklehorse sound. Even Danger Mouse, reportedly a huge Sparklehorse fan who is
    planning a proper collaboration with Linkous, keeps the beats in check. ""Please
    Don't Take My Sunshine"" fades out on his high-hat beat, and his sturdy drum
    sample stitches ""Getting It Wrong"" together, countering its decay with
    clockwork steadiness. With its vocals buried in a film of white noise and its
    melody interrupted by regular guitar squalls, ""Mountains"" proves the highlight
    of both the album and Danger Mouse's contributions. Against synth burbles,
    ambient drone, and a fixed beat, Linkous quotes lines from ""Twinkle Twinkle
    Little Star"", conveying overwhelming gravity and wonder, its innocence
    sprouting not from naiveté but from real experience with true misery.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Dreamt for Light Years</em> proves less targeted than 2001's <em>It's a Wonderful Life</em>, but
    this is a check in the plus column: Linkous sounds best when he's warring with
    structure and sound, when his songs sound unsettled. It's less fascinatingly self-destructive than
    1998's <em>Good Morning Spider</em>, but that
    album's devastating self-sabotage seems unrepeatable. Instead, this sweetly
    weird <em>Dreamt for Light Years</em> finds
    the common ground between the polished songcraft of the latter and sculpted
    static sounds of the former, resulting in an album that has the feel of a long
    journey undertaken. That metaphor usually signals a difficult, tedious work,
    but in this case it means these songs in this sequence comprise a solid,
    absorbing album with a shifting musical landscape and as many contradictions as
    any 40-minute passage in anyone's life. At the end of this journey is the title
    track, a ten-minute instrumental with barely a hint of meandering melody and
    dissolving structure. It could be death. Or rebirth. Or a dream inside the
    belly of a mountain. It's sure something.

    Radio Citizen makes music poured straight from the melting pot, with the
    burner turned up so high that you can't tell the original ingredients apart.
    It's a genre slurry that treats live instruments and samples equally and makes
    a smooth amalgam of Latin percussion, funk, dub, Afrobeat, Ethio-jazz,
    post-bop, modal jazz, rock, soul, bossa nova, hip-hop, trip-hop, film noir and
    blaxploitation soundtracks, assorted Middle Eastern and South Asian modes,
    French jerk-beat, library records from the 1970s, and some other stuff I
    probably forgot to mention. Radio Citizen's mastermind is Berlin musician Niko
    Schabel, a member of excellent modern funk group Poets of Rhythm and a
    collaborator with musicians as disparate from each other as militant
    proto-rappers the Last Poets and Franz Ferdinand's Nik McCarthy.</p><p>
    Schabel is a musician's musician, playing a whole rack of woodwinds, keys,
    and percussion, and he keeps a loose collective around him to fill in the gaps
    he can't cover with his own instruments and his sample library. His bass
    clarinet and Rhodes piano are two of the greatest textural elements in this
    music and exemplify the schism between rough wildness and cool, dark smoothness
    that provides the album's central tension. With 16 tracks all doing something
    different, it's hard to pin <em>Berlin Serengeti</em> down, but the overall feel
    is something like what you might expect from the soundtrack to the greatest
    as-yet-unfilmed European cop/heist/spy drama, with scenes set in the Far East.</p><p>
    One of Schabel's many weapons is a vocalist
    called Bajka, who sings in a few languages (lyrics are about the last thing
    that matter in music like this anyway). Her voice has a certain jazzy tinge to
    it, low and crisp, but she also sings with a detachment that puts her squarely
    in today's world. 
    </p>
<p>
    A few tracks function as interludes, but most are full songs
    with imaginative melodies and intricate production. ""Density"" is
    one of the best, with a wicked flute arrangement and hyperactive swing beat.
    It's like Quincy Jones's <em>Walking in Space</em> condensed down to just a
    couple of minutes and played by students of John Coltrane, Rahsaan Kirk and
    Pharaoh Sanders, with a drummer informed as much by Amon Tobin as Jack
    DeJohnette or Max Roach. ""The Hop"" falls more into the cracks between
    rock, hip-hop, and funk, riding a thumping beat with distorted Rhodes licks and
    Bajka's filtered vocal. 
    </p>
<p>
    Beyond the quality of the compositions, the sound is fantastic-- Schabel
    knows how to record instruments and EQ his samples. The acoustic bass tone is
    phenomenal-- you can feel the low notes rolling around in the soundbox
    before popping out the f-holes. On ""Night II"" you might as well be
    sitting on the fingerboard with the player's hands slapping down around you.
    ""Night I"" has the bass a little more in the pocket, hitched to a
    barnstorming Cuban groove with a rimshot tone from Heaven. 
    </p>
<p>
    The trick, though, is that I can talk about the Cuban groove, the bass
    sound, the horn arrangements-- those freaking saxes!-- but the reason the music
    works is that it's never any one thing alone making the song go. The music is
    details upon details, hung meticulously on memorable songs where jazz can
    casually wave hello to dub as they pass through a pile of drums together. It
    leaps dozens of genres in a single bound, digs up all those old sounds I love,
    fits them together, and erects a temple to pop's melting pot.

    This summer marked the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of
    the NME's <em>C-86</em> compilation. The 22 songs on this mail-order cassette are
    so widely venerated for propelling cute, jangly indie pop-- yes, twee-- to cult
    popularity that it might as well be true. Never mind that the tape included
    plenty of raucous and discordant bands, or that <em>C-81</em> was clearly better. It's
    far from surprising, but still twitterpating, then, that UK club night How
    Does It Feel to Be Loved? has chosen to release new indie pop comp <em>The Kids
    at the Club</em>. Like its precursor, or our collective impression of it, this
    CD-06 (if you will) culls together a variety of sweet, bouncy, melodic, and
    dorky guitar pop, with a few moments of quiet genius easily offsetting some
    modest flaws.</p><p>
    The aggressive wimpyness of <em>C-86</em> and progeny is the
    focus here, but their awkward primitivism remains mostly lost down the memory
    hole. I'm From Barcelona's ""We're From Barcelona"" is, of course, the
    opposite of ""lo-fi""-- a ska-speckled ode to joy (and friendship),
    sung by a choir of love/hateable Swedes-- and it's among the giddiest indie pop
    delights in recent memory. Other highlights are nearly as polished, though some
    groups, like Swedish goofs Suburban Kids With Biblical Names, tend to dirty
    things back up a bit. Shimura Curves carefully apportion electro-pop, Jesus
    &amp; Mary Chain fuzz, and bilingual romantic confusion on sparkly
    ""Noyfriend"",
    while fellow Londoners the Gresham Flyers toy with panning synth effects amid
    the boy/girl harmonies of ""Blackpool"". Elegant string arrangements
    and hushed Belle &amp; Sebastian vocals on the Butcher Boy's ""Days Like
    These Will be the Death of Me"" lead into a bath-draining guitar outro
    straight from Blur's <em>Modern Life Is Rubbish</em> moper ""Resigned"".</p><p>
    Indeed, another difference between <em>The Kids at the Club</em>
    and the indie pop canon is the very nostalgia entailed by such an endeavor. The
    Pastels, Talulah Gosh, and the Field Mice all had obvious influences, but true
    to press-release cliché, they carved out identifiable sounds of their own; here
    even above-average bands sometimes seem like worshipful echoes of yesterday's
    heroes more than exemplars of today's greatness. Austin's Voxtrot basically
    take the rhythm and vocal tics of the Smiths' ""This Charming Man"" and
    leave out everything that might be awkward during dorm room intimacy:
    ""Don't call me boring/ It's just 'cause I like you."" London-based
    Lucky Soul jack much more than a beat from ""Be My Baby"", and their
    ebullient ""Give Me Love"" suffers for the comparison, while Language
    of Flowers' ""You're the One"" would be one of the few tracks here
    wispy enough for Sarah Records if it weren't just like the Cure's ""Just
    Like Heaven"". A true pop kid might not mind, but a critic wants more. 
    </p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, <em>The Kids at the Club</em> is a fine
    introduction to current indie pop up-and-comers, complete with detailed liner
    notes. Both longtime followers of the scene and curious newbies will all likely
    find their own tracks to love, from Swedish 60s obsessives Irene's Jens
    Lekman-esque ""Stardust"" to Manchester-based Amida's ""Virtue Was
    Your Downfall"" with its Easybeats guitars, to synth-led London group
    Fosca's neurotic rallying cry ""I've Agreed to Something I Shouldn't
    Have"". The beloved Amelia Fletcher, who fronted Talulah Gosh and Heavenly,
    even makes an appearance with her current group, Tender Trap, declaring
    independence amid the Pixies-like loud-soft of ""Ampersand"". The more
    indie pop changes, the more it-- ""Oh well,"" the Wedding Present sang
    to end the original <em>C-86</em>, ""I hope you understand.""

A lot of what Jucifer do is heavy and some of it is pretty metal, but they also have a sludgy alternative element that almost no one pulls off any more. There's a lot of that on <em>If Thine Enemy Hunger</em>, the group's Relapse debut, which sounds  as if it was recorded in the mid-90s.</p><p>
    The record's kind of fascinating, really: Jucifer hit the mark so accurately with some of these songs that it almost makes me nostalgic. There's more than a little grunge here, and some of the songs are a little indistinguishable, but considering that most of the sounds on the disc come from one of three sources (guitar, drums, vocals), they manage to squeeze variety in when it counts.</p><p>
    Consider the riot-grunge of ""Antietam"", which employs, of all things, a banjo in the verses before bursting into crackled-voice, screeching chorus that would make L7 proud. But then they can also stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Melvins on tracks like the album-opening ""She Ties the Deep"", a seven-plus-minute dirge of punctuated guitar rumbling and sleepy vocals. If you want something a little catchier, on ""Pontius of Palia"" vocalist Amber Valentine belts out the lines with a sneer but her voice's melodicism belies any contempt.  She can sound syrupy sweet or dark and dour depending on the song, either contrasting or blending in with the thick fuzz of the guitar. </p><p>
    If only there were one or two more upbeat numbers here to break up the monotony. The disc's 15 tracks range from mildly energetic to borderline doze-worthy, and pushing a few of the more garage-influenced numbers up another notch or two would help the whole disc. Fifteen songs is a lot, really, especially for a pony with two tricks at most. But whatever; they use those two tricks to pull in a whole mess of grunge-metal influences and turn them into something that's pretty uniquely theirs, so I guess hitting the skip button every now and then isn't the worst thing in the world.</p></div>"|9414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9414-if-thine-enemy-hunger/|6.6|Cory D.

    Reportedly, My Morning Jacket hate being labeled Southern
    rock. Who can blame them? Their ambitions transcend genre tags, and besides, Louisville, the band's
    hometown, is located in Northern Kentucky and is arguably
    more Midwestern than Southern. So it can't be a coincidence that for their
    first-ever live album, curiously called <em>Okonokos</em>,
    My Morning Jacket chose to record their performance at classic-rock homestead
    the Fillmore West in San Francisco, about as far west as you can get from
    Kentucky without getting wet. Their aim seems to be to prove that their brand
    of rural classic rock, abandoned-silo reverb, and farmyard psychedelia can connect anywhere across the U.S.</p><p>
    If they're trying to avoid the Southern rock tag, what are
    they striving for? <em>Okonokos</em> shows the
    band trying to find out. <em>Z</em> positioned
    them as one of few contemporary bands that could appeal to a broad swath of the
    populace, from indie kids to frat boys to soccer moms to older listeners
    wondering why they don't make 'em like <em>Led Zeppelin IV</em>
    anymore. On stage, MMJ shed their regional associations and their signature
    reverb, but they're still an American band, reinventing classic rock as a
    bluegrassroots movement. The Skynyrdisms remain, but My Morning Jacket have
    added Zep-heavy riffs, Springsteenian grandeur, Bonnaroo-ready jams,
    and breezy SoCal pop into the mix, while retaining an enigmatic presence
    reminiscent of earliest R.E.M.</p><p>
    So the music on <em>Okonokos</em>
    never sounds vague or really even placeless, but instead has a jolt of fresh
    energy. The current lineup may be the band's best and most dynamic yet:
    disciplined enough to love the sound of every instrument clicking into place,
    as on ""One Big Holiday"", but also restless enough to keep the songs
    constantly shifting. The grandiose ""It Beats 4 U"" launches into its strange
    whistling bridge (reminiscent of Goldfrapp's<em>
</em><em>Felt</em><em> </em><em>Mountain</em>) before closing out with Patrick
    Hallahan's driving snare-led groove. It's a pretty neat sequence, but never
    feels showy or disconnected. Similarly, the reggae strut of ""Off the Record"" dissipates
    into a long, moody outro that swirls around the stageset flora, sounding looser
    and less directed than the studio version, as if the band made that transition
    on a collective whim.
    </p>
<p>
    My Morning Jacket's move away from a regional
    sound has been gradually progressing
    from the rural sounds of <em>At Dawn</em> and <em>The </em><em>Tennessee</em><em> Fire</em>--<em> </em>with their jumbles of guitar, banjo, harmonica, and reverb-- to
    the noodlier <em>It Still Moves</em> and the
    more electric, eclectic <em>Z</em>. So it's no
    surprise that the older material on <em>Okonokos</em>
    sounds most revitalized since it must be updated most dramatically to fit the
    band's increasingly expansive sound. Standouts ""The Way That He Sings"", ""Xmas
    Curtain"", and ""Lowdown"" are chirpy and bright without their original
    reverb. And nothing else on
    these two discs beats ""O Is the One That Is Real"" for its fierce rock assault,
    with singer Jim James' best performance of the evening propelled by Hallahan's slicing
    high hat and Bo Koster's noirish keyboards.
    </p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, <em>Okonokos</em>
    still feels strangely unfulfilling, never quite living up to My Morning
    Jacket's reputation as one of the best live acts around. James botches the
    big moment on opener ""Wordless Chorus"", overselling those climactic yawps so
    they come out like out-of-tune brays. ""Runthru"" has an enormous riff that works
    well in this setting, but that theatrical grandeur, as well as the explosion of
    distortion, only underscores how silly the song is: ""Oh shit run,"" James sings,
    with complete seriousness, ""oh shit run through the ghetto."" ""Gideon"" jams
    aimlessly, and ""Mahgeeta"" never seems to end.
    </p>
<p>
    Any live show will inevitably have crests and valleys, but
    besides these specific performances, <em>Okonokos</em>
    disappoints on a more general level: It too seldom sounds like an actual live
    album. There's almost no interaction between the performers and
    their audience: James never addresses the
    crowd and crowd noise is mostly inaudible except during the intervals between
    songs. Furthermore, the set list favors recent songs over older materials,
    which means there are fewer opportunities for dramatic reinterpretations. Aside
    from a few moments when they achieve a barreling momentum or hit a particularly
    tight groove, My Morning Jacket follow the prescribed routes set by the studio
    versions, sounding occasionally more intense but too often predictable in their
    course. These are minor complaints, as that respectable rating attests, but
    taken together, these shortcomings prevent listeners from getting any real
    sense of who these musicians are individually and collectively beyond what they
    could have learned from listening to the studio albums.

    ""Until tomorrow,"" the Polyphonic Spree once promised, though tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow have crept by at a sure 'nuff petty pace in the two years since. It's been almost as long since the success of Harry G. Frankfurt's <em>On Bullshit</em> inspired me to write my opus <em>On Procrastination</em>, and I don't need to tell you how that turned out. About three months ago, I was supposed to review <em>The Fragile Army</em>, the yet-unreleased third album by Tim DeLaughter and his newly de-robed 23-person backing cult; that was delayed and now instead, the Spree's aptly titled iTunes-only <em>Wait</em> EP finds the group trammeling their grandiose sound on two new songs and three ambitious covers. Aw hell, I'll give 'em an extension.</p><p>
    Besides, the Spree have clearly been doing their homework during the interim. No longer is every instrument playing at once, as on 2003 debut <em>The Beginning Stages</em>, nor must we withstand the neo-hippie theatricality of 2004's <em>Together We're Heavy</em>. Sure, the <em>Wait</em> EP's fresh compositions still worship the sun, but they're particularly reverent toward big, manipulative pop hooks. ""I'm on my way,"" DeLaughter declares confidently on ""Mental Cabaret"", as alt-rock guitars, crisp piano, and disco hi-hat battle the post-Flaming Lips synth robots. ""I'm Calling"" follows Wayne Coyne &amp; co. further into drippy MOR territory, though its harmony-upholstered chorus-- ""If I can't make it, I'll make it out""-- renders the Lips' recent ""Mr. Ambulance Driver"" an even bigger carwreck by comparison. While ostensibly selling us on love, these songs will just as appropriately hawk mp3 players or buddy comedies, and fair play, but still.</p><p>
    More interesting, and occasionally wtf-worthy, are the covers, two of which are produced by celebrated Los Angeles composer Jon Brion. The Largo regular who broadened Fiona Apple's smoky expanses does his part here to restrain the Spree's past extreme more-is-betterness. In a lush but straightforward rendition, the weirdly messianic vision of love depicted in the Psychedelic Furs' <em>Wedding Singer</em> jam ""Love My Way"" proves a natural thematic match for the Spree's ""new religion."" Brion guides again as the Spree stride blithely through Nirvana's ""Lithium"". Accepting Kurt Cobain's ""I'm so happy"" near face value, the Spree exacerbate his song's subversive bipolarity, burying his angst beneath glassy-eyed choir vocals, tinkling keys, and triumphal horns. Yeahy yeahy uh yeah.
    </p>
<p>
    A third cover, ""Sonic Bloom"", best illustrates both where the Spree have been and where they may be headed on their forthcoming album. Here DeLaughter (producing with wife/bandmate Julie Doyle as the Speekers) reimagines a song from 1998's <em>Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb</em> by his prior band, Tripping Daisy, festooning the original's romantic surge with <em>Sgt. Pepper</em>'s strings, horns, and his choir's swaying, love-giddy response: ""I do."" It makes me hope the wait will be worthwhile, even if DeLaughter's songwriting these days is rarely so pure and cathartic. ""Something is coming, but softly,"" he observes on ""Mental Cabaret"". My editor just heard the same ploy.

    On paper, a Dani Siciliano solo album looks engaging. The partnership
    she's had with Matthew Herbert since his 1998 record <em>Around the House</em> has
    resulted in some of the finest work in his sizable catalog; she's got an appealing
    voice, a unique sense of phrasing, and instrumental and production skills. That
    Herbert chips in on her solo records, adding production and instrumental bits,
    would seem to make them even more of a sure thing.</p><p>
    During its best moments, Siciliano's 2004 solo album <em>Likes...</em> delivered
    on the promise. The lengthy opener ""Same"" was an effective mood
    piece, taking some of Herbert's experiments in organic sampling and stasis into
    seductive territory. And the ""Come as You Are"" cover, while not
    revelatory, reinforced the notion that Cobain's magic wasn't all in the
    delivery, that he had songwriting chops that could survive genre interpolation.
    Siciliano heard a lot in his original and did a nice job describing just what.</p><p>
<em>Likes... </em>had its share of dull patches, though. Siciliano's style can seem so assured that the music comes over as effortless in the wrong
    way, causing well-crafted tracks to sound a touch bland. This sense of
    controlled proficiency colors more deeply her second record <em>Slappers.</em>
    ""Didn't Anybody Tell You"" and ""Why Can't I Make You High""
    are bulging with fun little noises, all manner of squeaks and cut-up
    instruments, and both have decent chorus hooks. She even invests a bit of
    upper-chest groan in ""Why Can't I Make You High"", setting aside her
    usual remove to belt like a blues shouter (relatively speaking), letting the
    acoustic guitar and standup bass bring her into a musical world that references
    western swing. But the music on these seems fussy, labored over, and ultimately
    flat. Better hooks would help, but that's only part of the problem.  
    </p>
    Siciliano
    needs some hurdles to step over for her skills to reveal themselves, and the
    best tracks here have a few. ""Think Twice"" is tense and jittery, with
    tiny noises poking at the melody from every angle, threatening to push it off
    course, and Siciliano sounds strong and assured as she keeps it flying
    straight. The repeating vocal fragments of ""Repeats""
    introduce a little pocket symphony of layered voices, mixed at times with
    Siciliano's clarinet, which is powerful and more dynamic than anything else
    here. And ""Be My Producer"" (one of the tracks Siciliano produced on
    her own; Herbert lends a hand here and there) crafts a clever electro-scat
    rhythm from tiny packets of voice. These and a couple of other tracks stand up to
    multiple listens, and the album as a whole is moderately enjoyable while it's
    on, but that's about it. Siciliano is a talent, certainly, but the breakout
    solo record still eludes her.</div>"|9421.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9421-slappers/|6.0|Mark Richardson

    Paul Schneider has such a perfect power-pop voice that I almost wonder if it
    was genetically engineered. It's very nasal, comes right from the top of the
    throat, and has just a little bit of grit-- it's like the Bomp!/Yellow Pills
    platonic ideal for singing voices. It would, however, be oversimplifying things
    to claim that Schneider's music is power-pop; I mean, it's pop, and it's got
    some punch, but he channels that voice into something decidedly modern where
    most power poppers check over their shoulders for cues from the 1960s and 70s.</p><p>
<em>Forever Debts</em> is more of a full-band effort than Schneider's 2003
    debut <em>Escape Velocity</em>, and it's also more straightforward. It's darker
    by a shade as well, though not quite as downcast as its cover might suggest.
    The high-contrast image of a black-and-white-suited Schneider, his matching
    guitar and photo of some intimate moment seems to explore the same kind of
    open-ended emotion his songs do. His lyrics don't so much tell stories as they
    dig around in the feelings that well up during a story's climax, when the straw
    breaks the camel's back and the relationship ends or the robbery is set in
    motion.</p><p>
    ""Payments they are due/ On the fourth of the month/ We don't have it
    now/ But we will,"" goes the second verse of opener ""The Crimes of
    Sivwitz"", encapsulating the sting of financial insecurity that most of us
    deal with-- hopefully more constructively-- at some point in our lives.
    Schneider has some fun with wordplay at the other end of the album on
    ""Imaginary Numbers"": ""1 is the square root of negative one/
    That's the quantity I didn't want to become again/ I thought I could on two/
    But it's divisible between me and you."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Schneider and his band, credited as the Close Talkers, hover in the middle
    tempos, but they keep things moving with shifts in the arrangements.
    ""Crimes of Sivwitz"" nicely transitions from a fluid intro to a tense
    buildup that spills into a crashing passage, and those dynamics aren't unusual
    on the record. ""Occupation"" pulls back for some screeching lead
    guitar from longtime Schneider mate Oscar Rodriguez, while ""Aisle"" has
    an irresistible beat. Distortion is used sparingly for emphasis, making the
    dynamic shifts that much more effective. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Forever Debts</em> finds Schneider honing his craft as a singer and
    songwriter with enjoyable results, though it lacks a definite standout like <em>Escape
    Velocity</em>'s title track. Among the things he's got going for him is an
    unwillingness to deal from the usual singer/songwriter deck of basic
    drumbeats and strumming patterns, instead preferring moody, electric
    arrangements. And then there's that voice, about as perfect a vehicle for his
    songs as you could ask for. If only every songwriter were so lucky.

    aliases (he's released more than 100 albums), is quite a puzzle.  His last
    record as Señor Coconut, <i>El Baile Aleman</i>, found him sampling traditional
    Latin American instruments and arranging them to play straight Kraftwerk
    covers. It was a fun record that I ultimately found a little hollow, and I've
    barely listened to it since I reviewed it.</p><p>
    Little did I know then that <i>El Gran Baile</i>, Schmidt's first album of
    original material as Señor Coconut (and in the UK, technically Coconut's debut),
    borders on brilliant. This remastered and augmented version of the record is
    just now seeing its first stateside release, after European distribution on
    Schmidt's own Rather Interesting label in 1997. Unlike <i>El Baile Aleman</i>,
    I hear very little kitsch on this album.  Schmidt is able to extract
    concentrate the inherently pleasurable Latin rhythms and textures, but he
    transposes the familiar music to the digital realm, and adds a fascinating
    layer of playfulness and unpredictability. It's seriously fun music.</p><p>
    As with many of his recent projects, Schmidt seems to delight in confounding
    expectations about sound sources. Some of these rhumba, mambo and salsa beats
    are likely lifted directly from records; others are painstakingly constructed
    from microscopic samples on Schmidt's computer; still others might contain
    live drums and xylophones.  And flitting through all the traditional Latin
    paraphernalia are glitches, synth stabs, scratches and the like.</p><p>
    Any individual track might be constructed from any combination of these
    sources. Some have only the slightest ""Latin"" feel, while others offer
    straighter interpretations of the sound. ""El Coco Baile"" could just be
    the result of a pitch-shifted salsa record spun on 78, if it weren't
    for the stuttering digital stutters that threaten to knock the dancing
    girls off their zapatas. ""Suavito"" is four parts Acapulco lounge band
    and one part Autechre, as some of the sounds occasionally get ""stuck""
    and go off into infinite loops.</p><p>
    Further removed from the record's theme is ""Diarios Clave,"" which has a
    kind of woodblock percussion and vibes happening on one level, but features
    punishing bass sounds and dirty funk snares that seem to have been brought
    in from entirely different musical worlds. The fun here, and throughout all
    of <i>El Gran Baile</i>, is tuning in to see what happens when these musical
    worlds collide.</p><p>
    Even further from homage to the music of Central and South America is ""La
    Noche Cool."" It begins as a gorgeous drone, and then expands to include some
    unidentifiable hums and buzzes.  Eventually, a piano pattern and some lazy
    percussion fade up, finally revealing the slight Latin connection.  The woozy,
    modulating tone that swims through the remainder of the track is not far from
    the breathtaking textures of Jan Jenelik's Loop-Finding Jazz Records; of
    course, this version was laid down four years earlier.  For the adventurous
    abstract DJ, this track would make for one cool night, indeed.</p><p>
    Had I heard this record before <i>El Baile Aleman</i>, I might have had some
    deeper insight into what Schmidt was doing with that Kraftwerk business. I'm
    not sure how much it would have affected my enjoyment, exactly, but this
    record has tuned me into the idea that he makes records as Señor Coconut
    to explore the idea of choosing a viewpoint and then seeing how he might

    One of the most strangely memorable things from this year's
    Sónar Festival was Scissor Sisters' surprise appearance. Unbeknownst to the
    audience, they'd been smuggled onto the schedule under the name White Diet (UK), and when
    they bounded on stage to close out the later afternoon portion of the
    second day, it was obvious the techno-friendly crowd was thrilled-- maybe even
    relieved-- to see them. Of course, context had something to do with that,
    but as the chaser to anywhere from 48 to 72 hours of straight techno (depending
    on how early in the week one started), Scissor Sisters' triple-layer cake of showmanship, falsettos, and 1970s AORisms felt like a treat.</p><p>
    On record, though, their
    extravagance becomes a hurdle. Not only are the Sisters'
    bawdy pop tracks overripe with in-jokey musical gags, they're relentlessly, almost confrontationally
    exuberant. ""Subtlety"" is not a part of the band's vocabulary; they're practically
    incapable of committing a hook, rhythm, or vocal to tape that isn't amped to
    cartoonish levels. While this mostly works for their singles, it
    makes their albums a different proposition altogether.</p><p>
    In other words, if you're not already predisposed to Scissor
    Sisters' campy ways, <em>Ta-Dah!</em> isn't going to change your mind. Even more streamlined, pop-minded, and high-spirited than their 2004 self-titled debut, it's
    as if they're single-mindedly attempting to depose the world's problems with a
    rigorous dance and good times regimen. But by the fourth or fifth song to bite a
    rhythm from the Muppet Jug Band, it's hard not to feel suspicious-- which is why
    how you square up with this band ultimately hinges on exactly what you get from their
    singles.
    </p>
<p>
    I personally get a lot. Whether that's down to my generally
    liberal attitudes towards anachronistic bands or the fact that Elton John and
    Bee Gees records were household staples while I was growing up is hard to say,
    but so long as Scissor Sisters are turning out joyously overstuffed choruses
    like the laser-drenched ""I Don't Feel Like Dancin'"" and the rollicking glam of ""She's My Man"" (on which they surprise by
    pilfering from early <em>80s</em>-era John,
    specifically ""I'm Still Standing""), everything else is easy to overlook. Happily,
    about half of this record is potential single material, from the Ana
    Matronic-led near-electro of ""Kiss You Off"" or icy ""The Other Side""
    (complete with !!!-jacking arpeggios), to the slippery disco of ""Ooh"".
    </p>
<p>
    That still leaves you with a good 25 minutes to fill, though, and
    where Scissor Sisters had the luxury of consulting five years' worth of demos
    for their debut, you can tell they have a bit more trouble here. Frustratingly, they resort to mugging for the camera whenever at a loss for direction. ""I Can't Decide"" is a
    honky-tonk/cabaret hybrid that drowns in its own clever-cleverness; ""Paul
    McCartney"" plays a joke on funk by speeding it up to a comical tempo; and
    ""Intermission"" is a long two minutes of speakeasy piano curlicues and Vaudevillian
    affectations. As a strategy, it rarely works, but thankfully those moments are few
    and far enough between that <em>Ta-Dah!</em>
    is surprisingly recommendable. Turns out these guys can still write some songs;
    imagine how good they'll be if they realize they don't need to bother with
    jokes too.

    For all the contemporary rock bands who advertize their cult-like credentials (Polyphonic Spree, Danielson), Akron/Family come closest to forging a genuine communion between their church and your state. And they do it without even acting like a cult: no fancy white robes or matching uniforms to delineate between the pulpit and the pews, no religious rhetoric to impose their ideology. Heck, Akron/Family don't even need to stand up-- their seated performances giving new meaning to the phrase ""rocking chair.""</p><p>
    Onstage, the Brooklyn quartet resembles a campfire folk circle where the players suddenly go up in flames, their sets marked by a series of light-switch flips between harmony and anarchy. But however peculiar the sight of four shirtless guys with mouths agape may be, the Akrons, like the best preachers, inspire their congregations to lose all sense of inhibition and surrender to the moment. It's just that instead of interpreting the Bible, the Akrons simply do what we all do when trying to make sense of the unexplainable: scream real loud.</p><p>
    Clearly, strange powers are at work here, and, on album 2.5-- following 2005's self-titled debut and this year's spectacular split-release with Angels of Light-- Akron/Family (getting help from Chicago jazz percussionist Hamid Drake) give praise to their mysterious, indefinable guiding light with a nine-minute overture titled ""Blessing Force"". Like the stunning ""Awake""/""Moment"" opening suite from the Angels of Light disc, it's made up of a series of abrupt, jarring juxtapositions: high-voltage psych riffage, a cappella group chanting, wavy-arm-dance boogie-rock,  mandolin folk breakdowns, apocalyptic noise squall, free-jazz sax wig-out. But what's missing this time is a sense of dramatic momentum or resolution-- ""Blessing Force"" is less a song than an Akron/Family highlight reel, with little context holding the divergent strands together.
    </p>
<p>
    However, as <em>Meek Warrior</em> unfolds, the purpose of ""Blessing Force"" becomes more clear-- it's an exorcism of Akron/Family's chaotic compulsions (though these can only be suppressed for so long, as the late intrusion of Oneida-like organ grinder ""The Rider"" attests). Where their side of the Angels of Light split hinted at conventional indie rock anthemics (the majestic ""Future Myth"" could've marched in from a major-label-era Built to Spill or Modest Mouse record), <em>Meek Warrior</em> feels like a step toward a more elemental, back-to-nature ethos. Second track ""Gone Beyond"" is as simple as ""Blessing Force"" is cumbersome, a <em>Led Zeppelin III</em> throwback with a single repeated lyric (""Gone, gone, gone beyond/ Gone completely beyond"") that suggests a certain weariness with progression and a comfort in the act of retreat. And despite its name-check of the Rhode Island thrash duo, ""Lightning Bolt of Compassion"" is pure Nick Drakery (albeit unintelligibly so).
    </p>
<p>
    The Akrons' striking group harmonies are at a greater premium here than before, but the grainy, more intimate production retains a sense of communal participation. And just because the Akrons are turning down doesn't mean they've stopped stretching out: The mesmerizing  ""No Space in This Realm"" begins as a back-porch strum (with lyrics about ""booming bling and car alarms"" that playfully clash with the song's field-recording ambience) before achieving lift-off from a tabla-tapped raga rhythm, with interweaving horn and flute lines accruing into a dreamy drone-- in other words, psych-folk that doesn't feel like the simple mashing of two adjectives but a faultless melding of complementary ideals.
    </p>
<p>
    The song's chorus line (""space is love"") is echoed in <em>Meek Warrior</em>'s closing country hymn, ""Love and Space"", which captures the Akrons lost in some forest in the dead of night, throwing their guitars on the fire just to stay warm. Each Akron takes a turn singing to the Lord, asking Him to open up their hearts, if only to remind them how it feels to feel. Stripped of the spoils of technology and electricity, the Akrons repeat the song's title like some hypnotized barbershop quartet, resolutely singing into the black that they refuse to fade into. With all due respect to Josh Homme, meet the true Eagles of death mettle.

    In spite of Andy LeMaster's penchant for concept albums about
    break-ups and Conor Oberst-like melodrama, Now It's Overhead is an anomaly in
    the Saddle Creek stable. Omaha's indie powerhouse was founded (however
    intuitively) upon the notion that chaotic guitars, raw vocals, and
    unfettered recordings are the watermarks of authentic emotion. The
    label has evolved away from its emo-punk roots, but most of its acts
    still bear some trace of that ideological residue. Azure Ray traffics
    in pious delicacy, while Two Gallants shreds up rustic twang. Conor
    Oberst still makes room for accidental notes and off-key vocals amid
    the increasing polish of his music. The common thread is a tacit belief
    that a song's impact relies upon the palpable presence of a fallible
    human behind it: High premiums are placed upon the squeak of calluses
    on nylon strings, the voice that passionately falters, the ambient
    chatter of friends gathered in the studio. (As of press time, there is
    still no accounting for the Faint.)</p><p>
    With his dream-pop project Now It's Overhead, LeMaster turned Saddle
    Creek's lo-fi bias on its head. Tim Kasher's ruptured howl and sweeping
    guitarscapes owe an obvious debut to Bono and the Edge; LeMaster seems
    more interested in U2 producer Steve Lillywhite's expansive, densely
    stylized armatures. Now It's Overhead's underrated debut, where indie
    rock and electro-pop tangled in intricate chiaroscuro, had songs that
    were as pretty as their flamboyant gowns. They failed to surpass it on
    their sophomore effort, <em>Fall Back Open</em>, which contained plenty of
    compelling sounds, but nothing as infectious as ""Hold Your Spin"" or as haunting as ""With a Subtle Look"". That album's muzziness is
    dispelled on their third LP, <em>Dark Light Daybreak</em>, an album of austere,
    messianic indie rock that finds the band leaning harder on emphatic
    guitars than ever before. As always, Now It's Overhead revels in the
    seamless artifact, to the point where one starts wishing for seams--
    LeMaster's grand gestures veer dangerously close to turgidity at times,
    just as the album's carefully pruned mien flirts with anonymity.</p><p>
    You can hear echoes of the Flaming Lips' sculpted, spacey rock on <em>Dark Light Daybreak</em>, as well as Spiritualized's womblike enclosures. Individual parts hang in glittering suspension, connected by intricately programmed drum patterns and digital interludes. That the music intends to be monolithic is manifest on tracks like ""Let the Sirens Rest"", where LeMaster's reedy but resonant voice breaks majestically over a serrated horizon of insistent guitars and pulsating electro. You can hear it on the burred shoegaze of ""Estranged"", and in the luminous chorus that suddenly beams out from the gusty shadows of ""Believe What they Decide"". The album's hooks are more memorable than its predecessor's-- ""Meaning to Say"", ""Night Vision"", and the title track all revolve around swelling melodies that aren't outshone by their sumptuous appointments. But for an album with such a diverse sound palette, it spends too much time in one mode-- sincere, mid-tempo grandeur-- to be more than another solid, perfectly listenable album from a band that's going to do something truly terrific if their early substance catches up with their refined style.

    schizos its way between the monsters of art school post-punk,
    watered-down kraut rock, and late-1990s slacker electronica as curated by
    Beck. Throw in some one-off psychedelic frittering and this Londoner's
    seriously angling for the title of Renaissance Dude. Unfortunately, this
    purported acid trip through cerebral rock history is performed with smoke and mirrors-- it's a feat in versatility and sonic landscapes
    but a labored tour of influences.</p><p>
<em>Arts &amp; Crafts</em> compartmentalizes its touchstones with the
    organization of a spice rack. ""Ode to Immer Wieder"" and ""The Exit""
    bookend the album with candy-coated takes on Neu!, Can, and Berlin-era
    David Bowie. While this sequencing could bring about allegations of
    intellectual pandering or window dressing, these tracks possess the
    gravitas of Air's more cartoonish kraut takes. ""Ralph and Barbara"" melts the album's otherwise cold, electronic heart
    with an acoustic gem straight from the outtakes of an Elephant 6 jam
    session. Taking this lysergic aura and running with it, ""The Truth"" and
    ""TX81Z"" constitute the meaty crux of the album, glossing the surf-psych
    melodies over with layers of <em>Odelay</em> and <em>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</em>.
    Catchy, yes, but these saccharine babies rot the stomach pretty
    quickly. ""TX81Z"" especially reveals Webster's limitations, a seemingly
    endless chain of the same chord progression gone Groundhog Day, each
    repetition featuring a bland permutation of synths, keyboards and other
    sound effects.</p><p>
    The album's final third feels like the debris from this
    not-so-mind-altering explosion. Webster's clearly aiming for a
    second-half cool down reminiscent of <em>Low</em>'s but his diarrhetic
    tendencies pack too many bells and whistles on what should be sparser,
    subtler tracks. ""The Ghosts"" puts Pink Floyd's greatest hits in a
    blender and sets it to puree, topping off the sludge with a hint of
    Gary Numan's signature sci-fi synths. Sure, sometimes the heady stuff
    flies, but too often Webster's taking hits off <em>Dark Side</em>'s bong without actually inhaling, and the overly regimented genre-hopping totally ruins the high.</p></div>"|9439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9439-arts-crafts/|6.2|Adam Moerder

White male sensi-singers, predominately in
    their mid twenties or early thirties, dominated the airwaves. Chief among them
    was Clay Walker, who-- aside from scoring two feel-good hits that were
    essentially blue-collar translations of <em>carpe
    diem</em>-- climbed the charts with a handful of soulless, sad-eyed ballads about
    unrequited or abandoned love. Walker's
    voice was masterful, but he couldn't wrangle the
    right emotion out of lines about being a ""fixture on an old forgotten wall."" As
    such, country patriarch Hank Williams is to Clay Walker as, 10 years later,
    acoustic songwriting fixture Nick Drake is to Alexi Murdoch.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Like Walker, Drake, and Williams, the Scottish-born,
    London-raised, and Los Angeles-living Murdoch has the gift of voice: His
    mid-range tenor is rich and generous, perfectly suited for the autumnal imagery
    of ""Orange Sky"", the song that launched a major-label bidding war (which he
    escaped) after its placement on ""The O.C."" That track was the best moment on his 2002 debut EP, and it claims the same laurel
    on his 11-track debut LP, <em>Time Without
    Consequence</em>. Murdoch's not all hopeful
    tranquility, however; <em>Time Without Consequence</em>
    is also about searching for happiness, stumbling through darkness,
    dealing in desolate hours-- and Murdoch's voice is simply too pleasant and
    staid to express the range his songwriting implies. Nothing seems hard-won.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    ""And though I have the strength to move a hill/ I can hardly
    leave my room,"" sings Murdoch on ""Wait"", one of several <em>Time</em> tracks where he overplays love-as-life analogies. As
    he does elsewhere, Murdoch uses a surprising minor chord change to illustrate
    announced despair, but it seems as though he's left with those devices simply
    because he can't sing his way into evocation. Vocally, his sadness isn't
    convincing: The interminable length of lonely days Murdoch mentions on ""Song for You"" is described but not illustrated, and the anxious exuberance written
    and played about in ""Love You More"" never gets needed vocal confirmation.
    </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Because he seems largely incapable of pushing his voice beyond
    satisfied emotional stasis, Murdoch stretches the band that supports his
    careful finger-picking, experimenting with arrangements in a way that offers
    more promise than the rest of the album. Nuanced production decisions like an
    ambient pedal point icing through ""Wait"" or atonal string flourishes ripping far
    beneath the Delta-to-downtown acoustic guitar of ""Dream About Flying"" suggest
    that Murdoch, who produced the album and directed its pool of capable
    left-coast session players, is thinking beyond the archetypal austerity,
    orchestration and restraint of Drake and the Zombies' Colin Blunstone. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But, perhaps for that reason, the disc's biggest, loudest
    moments-- both almost entirely instrumental-- seem like conscious, awkward
    decisions to roar free of the hem of vocal-imposed nicety: ""12"" builds through
    post-rock clang and guitar shimmers before its seven minutes expire, and """"Home""
    elicits feedback and layers of tabla. Sure, Murdoch could sing his way into a
    wet kiss or a record deal, but, here, he can't conduct that, his best tool,
    into believability.

December 1991,     the annual ""Year in Music"" roundup, is a particularly edifying issue.     Tucked away in the record review section is a 170-word quickie about a new     album by Nirvana. Lauren Spencer gives <em>Nevermind</em> the green light (the     only ratings then were green, yellow, and red) and says, ""I swear you'll be     humming these songs for the rest of your life."" A couple pages later is a     lukewarm (yellow) review of a new My Bloody Valentine album called <em>Loveless</em>.     Jim Greer is bummed that it doesn't sound more like Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears.     Oh well. In a ""Ten Best Albums of the Year You Didn't Hear"" sidebar, <em>Spin</em> extols the virtues of Pavement's <em>Perfect Sound Forever </em>EP and Royal     Trux' <em>Twin Infinitives</em>. The ""Artist of the Year"" on the cover?     Perry Farrell.</p><p>One narrative for the decade, then, was pretty well laid out by December     1991. And Jane's Addiction were central to that story, even though, as Farrell     discusses in the accompanying interview, they had just broken up. After that     summer's Lollapalooza tour, the first, Jane's were no more. But it didn't matter     then that they were supposedly finished, since they'd already set the tone for     the next several years of youth culture. Greil Marcus argued that Bob Dylan     invented the 1960s with ""Like a Rolling Stone""; by similar logic, you     could say that Jane's Addiction invented the 90s in the time between <em>Nothing's     Shocking </em>and that first Lollapalooza.</p><p>Jane's were proud to be alternative music icons, and Farrell had the     dreadlocks to prove it. Though they were arty and just a little dangerous,     Jane's were oddly accessible, which helped push the underground up into the     sunlight. They sang about things like heroin and serial killers but seemed <em>relatable</em> somehow; whitebread Midwesterners could ""get"" them, no problem.     Authenticity was never an issue with Perry Farrell. You knew he grew up a     middle-class Jewish kid, that his father was a jeweler, and that, in the great     tradition of rock music, he was able to reinvent himself completely as a     chronicler of L.A.'s bohemian underbelly. He said ""motherfucker"" a lot,     like he was some street dude, even though he was a child of privilege. His     background didn't matter; what counted was who he wanted to be. Because of his     influence, we had a nation of college kids with more beer money than     sense serenading next-door neighbors with impromptu acoustic renditions of     ""Jane Says"". (I wasn't the only one, was I?)</p>
<p>And then there was the music, which brought several strands of 80s     underground culture under a single tent. There was the scratchy wah-wah     funk, the gothic undercurrent of Eric A's bass-- lines for the ages, truly, and     there will never be a Jane's without him-- and Dave Navarro's guitar, which was both     ""heavy"" in the metal sense but always ready to lose the weight and     drift off into a psychedelic space. Something for everybody who liked the music     chronicled in <em>Our Band Could Be Your Life</em>, really; a canny musical blend     from a very canny band.</p>
<p>Jane's weren't finished in 1991, of course, and even then people probably     suspected as much. The pull to see if something more can be salvaged-- and to     make more money-- is strong, and Jane's reunited live periodically and returned     with <em>Strays </em>in 2003. By then, the sound they helped create at the dawn     of the 90s had become rock's standard expression, and they seemed content to     blend in with the nu-metal multitudes. It's not a particularly good record. And     so when I remember Jane's Addiction, I like to remember the one that broke up     at the height of their powers in 1991, with two amazing studio albums and that     initial live document to their names.</p>
<p>Their brief initial run presents an immediate problem as far as compiling a     best-of: why whittle two discs, which together add up to 96 minutes of music,     to one? Filler on both <em>Nothing's Shocking </em>and <em>Ritual de lo Habitual </em>is     almost non-existent, so if you're looking for an introduction to Jane's     Addiction, why not just start with one of those? The answer provided by     this track selection-- so that you can also get ""Superhero"" and     ""Just Because"" from <em>Strays</em>, ""Whores"" from the live     debut, and a ""Jane Says"" recorded on the first Lollapalooza tour and     released previously on the vault-clearing <em>Kettle Whistle</em>-- doesn't wash.     This best-of exists because important bands are supposed to have best-ofs.</p>
<p>But still: ""Stop"", ""Ocean Size"", ""I Would for     You"", ""Been Caught Stealing"", ""Summertime Rolls"",     ""Mountain Song"", etc. Even ""Superhero""-- or, as I like to     call it, ""Rag Doll 2003""-- isn't so bad, for a knockoff of     late-period Aerosmith. But hearing ""Three Days"" and not having it     followed by ""Then She Did"", well, it hurts a little. And as for the     live ""Jane Says"", maybe everyone tired of the <em>Nothing's Shocking </em>version,     I don't know. I never did. Matter of fact, I'm looking at that guitar in the     corner that hasn't been tuned in five years and I remember how it goes-- just G     and A, isn't it? But OK, the live version is decent, and it's a nice reminder     that Jane's came so close to the best band breakup since the Beatles. No band     since has been as far in front as they were in December 1991, and though this     comp is unnecessary, it explains why.</p></div>"|9430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9430-up-from-the-catacombs-the-best-of-janes-addiction/|8.5|Mark Richardson

    in a bow of heavy yet cheeky conceptual art. Leaving aside its manifestos and jokes, which are undoubtedly a key
    part of the band's appeal, these pasty English folks were pioneers
    of electro, hip-hop, and even Latin freestyle and house. (You'll still catch
    ""Beat Box"" on many a U.S. urban station's ""Flashback Lunch"" hour.) <em>And
    What Have You Done With My Body God?</em> is a new 4xCD box that takes
    pages from the group's sketchbook of ideas, with something like more than 40
    unreleased tracks.</p><p>
    The lead instrument in the Art of Noise was the Fairlight CMI, the first
    digital sampler. You can hit up Wikipedia for much more detailed info, but
    suffice to say it was an incredibly expensive instrument. In its final
    version, the 1985 CMI Series III, it went for about £50,000-- all for
    features that you could get from a $400 yard sale PC today. As a result, it was used mostly
    by art rockers and big name studio techs and producers. (What's most amazing
    is that technology was moving so fast that only a few years later digital
    samplers would be cheap enough to be democratized, leading to hip-hop and
    dance music's sampling golden era.) Even a casual pop listener might
    recognize some of AON's tics and noises, the vocal stabs and stuttering
    hooks it built its name on. (The ""hey!"" vocal hook off of ""Close (To the
    Edit)"" would make the band a little richer when sampled by the Prodigy for
    ""Firestarter"".)</p><p>
    Already built on sampled drum breaks, ghostly choirs of multi-tracked
    vocals, and string loops, <em>And What Have You Done</em> sounds like the band
    never, ever left the studio, pushing a small handful of sampled elements
    into as many different shapes as it possibly could before it got bored or
    the money ran out. But despite the mad scientist nature of this creative over-abundance, the Art of Noise's music isn't cold or forbidding
    or boringly studio hidebound; it can even be lovely. The group's
    masterpiece, ""Moments in Love"", is a 10-minute new age make-out track
    built on floating motes of voice and shiver-up-the-nape-of-your neck
    strings, the kind of thing Harold Budd might throw in when it's time to knock boots.
    It gets three re-workings here-- including the 7"" mix on the <em>Into
    Battle</em> EP-- not counting the tracks that feature just a
    sound or two plucked from it.
    </p><p>
    Much of <em>And What Have You Done</em> barely qualifies as ""songs,"" just a few
    minutes of a beat being fucked with-- say, played up and down the octaves of
    the Fairlight or reversed and put through a filter. (There's also some
    seriously creepy circus music, experiments for voice, and solos for
    keyboard.) And some of is just studio fuck-around stuff that no one's life
    would have been any poorer had it stayed in the vault. But the sketchier
    tracks sound undeniably like first generation IDM-- the early records of
    Plaid and Aphex Twin, winsome keyboard melodies over crunchy hip-hop
    breakbeats-- obviously an important (and unheard until now) bridge between
    American street-level electro and the bedroom electronic producers of the
    90s. As a document of digital creative thrift, four discs of unfinished
    studio experiments and obsessive self-remixing is amazing and exhausting.
    And now that computer beats are no longer the strange, alchemical art of
    pay-no-attention-to-the-man-behind-the-curtain types, we'll never see
    another band like the Art of Noise, for better or worse.

A rather eccentric altar     boy who, on the Sleepy Jackson's 2003 <i>Lovers</i> debut, admitted to fantasies of ""wear[ing]     a miniskirt into town,"" but who also never forgets his humble position on the     celestial food chain.</p>
<p>Where <i>Lovers</i>' flights of glam-pop fancy concealed what     was essentially a bitter break-up album (see: the still-stinging double shot of     ""This Day"" and ""Acid in My Heart""), <i>Personality: One Was a Spider, One Was a     Bird</i> makes us privy to even more intimate conversations-- ones with the man     upstairs and the unruly tenant down below. Like another, more famous Australian     songwriter, Nick Cave, Steele presents God and the Devil less as religious     deities than mythical personifications of morality and temptation. But where     Cave's lyrics revel in the fire and brimstone of the scriptures, Steele simply portrays     God and the Devil as characters in an unfolding domestic drama, placing them in     mundane scenes-- ""Witches in my swimming pool/ Devils in my brother's room/ How     long 'til God knows that?""-- that are as confounding as they are grounding.</p>
<p>Fitting, then, that the war for     Steele's soul should take place on a musical foundation that was originally set     by a man who had a somewhat conflicted relationship with religion, to say the     least: Sir John Winston Lennon. (No surprise, given Steele's professed Fab Four     fandom, though <i>Lovers</i> had us believe he was more a George Harrision kinda guy.) To be completely reductive, <i>Personality</i> is the album Lennon didn't release in between <i>Mind Games</i> and <i>Walls and Bridges</i>. But then as Steele correctly assumes, symphonic 70s soft-rock is the closest that secular pop music ever got to capturing the     sound of heaven. Or at least it provides the cinematic dream-sequence version     of it: soft-focus melodies, a chorus of sexually ambiguous angels cooing helium-high     harmonies, a string section floating on a bed of the clouds, slide-guitar     sweeps that glide into eternity.</p>
<p>The album was recorded with a seven-piece band     and a 24-piece orchestra, and it's easy to imagine all of them playing their     parts while dressed in white silk pajamas.     But when you look past the high     concepts, clunky album subtitles, and ridiculously solipsistic cover art (featuring     a topless Steele carrying a wounded twin version of himself, seemingly marked with     stigmata), <i>Personality</i> is an immediate, alluring, and frequently arresting song     cycle that plays to Steele's core strengths-- his dreamily effeminate voice and     melancholic melodies-- while wisely abandoning <i>Lovers'</i> half-hearted attempts at     mod garage-rock (""Vampire Racecourse"") and electro-disco (""Tell the Girls That I'm     Not Hangin Out"").</p>
<p>If <i>Personality</i> is missing some of the cheeky charm Steele     brought to <i>Lovers</i>'<i> </i>pedal-steeled standout, ""Miniskirt"", the album's blissful     ignorance of prevailing indie faddism will serve it well in the long run. And     even though the God vs. Devil showdown ends more in a stalemate than apocalypse-- ""How was I supposed to know I was on my own?"" Steele asks on the closer,     gazing skyward while the orchestra pit blares-- hopefully it's just an easy     ploy to set up the sequel.</p></div>"|9319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9319-personality-one-was-a-spider-one-was-a-bird/|7.8|Stuart Berman

    Typically whenever I hear a line like, ""Hello my name is human/ And I come from love"", I leap across the room in one of those slow-motion
    Noooooooooo! shots to punch the EJECT button. But I'll give Sol Seppy a pass...this time. She sings that line on ""Human"", the second track from her debut
    album, <em>The Bells of 1 2</em>, so earnestly
    that I almost believe her, and she's backed only by an elegant piano theme that
    complements the lilt in her voice. It's a supremely pretentious moment, but
    undeniably heartfelt.</p><p>
    Sol Seppy is the stage name of Sophie Michalitsianos, a
    classically trained pianist and cellist who has collaborated and toured with
    Sparklehorse and is now releasing her own debut. <em>The Bells of 1 2</em> is intended to be an enormous statement about the
    nature of humanity and the metaphysics of love. To convey her message-- that
    love defines humanity, that humanity's potential for love motivates events
    large and small-- Michalitsianos adopts an approach that could best be
    described as immensely intimate. Opener ""1 2"" begins with what sounds like a
    child's music box playing a small tune; a few measures in, a colossal organ fills
    the space around it. This contrast between titanic and tiny defines
    Michalitsianos' music, as she mixes earthy pop elements (she knows her way
    around a hook) with airier Western Christian hymns and canticles. Despite its
    overindulgences and insistences, <em>The
    Bells of 1 2</em> proves enthralling as cathedral-size organs whirl majestically,
    synths pulse and flutter solemnly, violins swirl hypnotically, and piano notes resound
    tenderly. Drums are mostly absent, although programmed beats blare menacingly
    on the buzzy ""Slo Fluzz"" and ""Move"", sounding either like a retro nod to
    mid-1990s trip-hop or just a dated element.</p><p>
    In the middle of this joyful noise Michalitsianos sings in a
    breathy voice that alternates gentle confession and direct confrontation,
    intimating her beliefs and misgivings with obvious conviction. Despite the
    worldly reach of her lyrics, she makes <em>The
    Bells of 1 2</em> sound curiously insular-- lonely even-- as if she's alone
    in her room picking out melodies on the piano (to an extent this impression is
    true: She recorded in the album in her own studio and acted as engineer and
    produder). As a result, despite the calculation that obviously went into these
    songs, they still sound dreamily spontaneous, creating a spiritual space in
    which Michalitsianos can practice a very personal form of worship that invokes
    Ensh'Allah on ""Enter One"" (the phrase means God's will) and gently proselytizes
    happiness on ""Injoy"". True, the meaning remains a little abstract and, as
    quoted above, sometimes silly, but the music sounds truly inspired.

    Composer/multi-instrumentalist James LaValle has certainly generated his fair sum of impeccable music-- both in collaboration with sympathetic acts like Sigur Rós or the Black Heart Procession and as author of his ongoing project the Album Leaf. Past works like 2004's <em>In a Safe Place</em> or last year's <em>Seal Beach</em> EP have shown LaValle able to patiently craft sonorous ambient crescendos with the best of them, yet at some point even the most fastidious listeners have to be anxious to see him get his clothes a little rumpled. Unfortunately, however, on LaValle's latest release, <em>Into the Blue Again,</em> the operative word is ""Again"". Here he takes the Album Leaf on a romantic tour of all the familiar post-rock haunts, guiding the listener though another tranquil series of shivery watercolor instrumentals and hand-carved melodic scrimshaw, the music's gentle restraint quickly blurring into a needlessly restrictive caution.</p><p>
    LaValle recorded the basic tracks for <em>Into the Blue Again</em> at Bear Creek Studio in Washington, and then took the album to Iceland to be mixed under the watchful eye of Brigir Birgisson, the engineer at Sigur Rós' Sundlaugin studio. The Black Heart Procession's Pall Jenkins chips in with lyrics and vocals on a few tracks, while guests like violinist Matthew Resovich make brief but crucial cameos. For the most part however, LaValle handles the instrumental duties himself, building these pieces upon a reliable foundation of Rhodes piano, unobtrusive electronics, and a polite mix of acoustic and programmed drumming. Perhaps as a consequence of LaValle's increased self-reliance, much of <em>Into the Blue Again</em> has an air of stifled insularity, with many of his admittedly gorgeous melodies pressed nearly lifeless beneath the fingerprints of the album's antiseptic, fussed-over construction.</p><p>
    Several of the songs on <em>In a Safe Place</em> had a fruitful second life as background fodder on television soundtracks, and it's not much of a stretch to imagine several performances on <em>Into the Blue Again </em>enjoying a similar fate. On vocal numbers such as the lovely ""Always For You"", Pall Jenkins' lyrics have been trimmed down to their romantic essentials, stripped of all personal effects and identifying features. ""All these things we tried to change/ Were never easy to contain/ It was always meant for you,"" sings LaValle with exquisite, nonspecific ardor-- the song's potential dramatic utility only as limited as the screenwriter's imagination. Likewise, ""Writing on the Wall"" and ""Wherever I Go"" flawlessly hit their marks, matching LaValle's wistful pop melodicism with gracefully billowing strings and crisp, snappy drumwork. 
    </p>
<p>
    Despite the Album Leaf's studied textures and buoyant songcraft, there is a crippling lack of tension inherent within <em>Into the Blue Again</em>'s careful constructions. Instrumental pieces like the opening groundswell ""The Light"" or the rippling ""Red-Eye"" can be temporarily breathtaking, but ultimately feel confined by the self-imposed limits LaValle has placed on this material. Every sonic detail is gradually unspooled with such predictable and scrupulous precision that the listener can rest assured that nothing jarring or dissonant might ever be allowed to cast a ripple across the music's placid surfaces. And until LaValle proves willing to expose his compositions to more alien and/or volatile elements, the Album Leaf will have to content itself to a tasteful but restrained hothouse existence.

    Lupe Fiasco is not the artist you think he is: Though he's been touted as everything from deck-wielding hip-hop savior
    to carpetbagging poseur, Fiasco is actually more of a dilettante.
    Which is not to say he's untalented-- he is, extraordinarily so. The Chicago
    MC sports one of the slipperiest flows I've heard in a long time-- he's dexterous
    but never technical, sly but not arrogant. He rarely hangs on syllables too
    long and never wastes a word. And words are plentiful on his debut album, the long-delayed <em>Food &amp; Liquor</em>. Fiasco's a self-proclaimed
    entrepreneur wading against a current he can't seem to condone: Hip-hop circa
    2006. His first album's the work of an MC in love with rap's freedom of
    expression but at odds with its current
    landscape.</p><p>
    Where Fiasco misses classic status is his sonic approach. The
    album's sound-- produced in large part by the 1<sup>st</sup>
    and 15<sup>th</sup> Productions duo Soundtrakk and Prolyfic-- is clearly influenced
    by the bombastic derring-do of Kanye West's <em>Late Registration</em>, the record on which Fiasco was
    famously introduced. Much of <em>Food &amp; Liquor</em> is draped in stuttering, chopped
    strings and blaring guitar. Tracks like ""He Say She Say"" and ""Sunshine"", with their sweeping violas, sound like manipulative film music, undermining an MC bursting with enthusiasm by portraying him as
    some sort of epic figure, here to erase and rewrite rap lore. Call it Score-Hop-- only the sentiment doesn't match the performer, particularly for a rapper blowing
    up because he wrote a deft song about skateboarding. He also blogs,
    loves anime, and collects toys. Not exactly the stuff of Tolstoy.</p><p>
    Where West mined humor and pathos out of his delusional
    grandiosity, Lupe too often falls back on smug in-fighting. On the closing
    verse of the mostly sublime Jill Scott-assisted jazz joint ""Daydreamin'"", Fiasco-- with the wily tone of a nasally Chi-Ali-- mocks his peers. ""Now come on
    everybody, let's make cocaine cool/ We need a few more half-naked women up in
    the pool,"" he raps. Only seconds later he swallows
    the shit and stops grinning, opting for introspection: ""I'd
    like to thank the streets that drove me crazy/ And all the televisions out there
    that raised me."" Why the ridicule before the contemplation? Maybe it
    lies in Fiasco's faith, which dictates some of
    his preachier verses. The influence is
    clear on ""Intro"", which echoes the opening track of Mos Def's debut, and the
    brilliant screed ""American Terrorist"".
    </p>
<p>
    More troubling is Fiasco's apparent inability to write fly hooks. While his verses are
    packed with wit and double meaning, his hooks are mostly blandly-sung,
    unmemorable couplets. This highlights what may be <em>Food &amp; Liquor</em>'s biggest
    flaw: It's just not that fun. This is not to say there isn't a place for grand,
    thoughtful hip-hop-- there isn't nearly enough. But on the strength of his 1<sup>st</sup>
    and 15<sup>th</sup> mixtapes, the joyful ""Kick, Push"", and effervescent ""I
    Gotcha""-- one the best Neptunes tracks in years-- Fiasco's at his best when he's a bit livelier. This is to say nothing of ""Outro"", another
    grandiloquent production, minus the intelligence. It's 12 minutes (!) of Lupe
    shouting out people like MTV, his nieces, nephews, and his ""big homie Shondell.""
    It's barely listenable once, let alone repeatable. There is also a track on
    here produced by Linkin Park's
    Mike Shinoda featuring onelinedrawing's Jonah Matranga of which we will say no more.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, this sounds negative, but it's more
    the notes of a slightly disappointed fan. I never fell in love with the
    highly regarded leak of this album months ago, but this is an improvement, with
    futuro-funk tracks like ""The Cool"" (from Kanye West) and ""I Gotcha"" added to
    the mix. The album's best song, ""Hurt Me Soul"", is as ostentatiously conceived
    as much of the album, brimming with lush strings and a single plinking piano
    courtesy of Needlz-- his only solo production.
    </p>
<p>
    Lyrically, Fiasco is vivid and nimble
    and appealingly contradictory. He opens with the accusatory, ""I used to hate
    hip-hop, yup, because of the women degraded"" and then explains he was swayed by
    Too $hort's humor. He later questions Jay-Z (a noted supporter of Fiasco's) and
    his ""never prayed to God, I pray to Gotti"" credo from ""D'Evils"", only to become
    a convert after his 30th viewing of ""Streets Is Watching"" which has him
    ""back to givin' props again."" All essential battles for any serious hip-hop
    fan. But this is a tough tightrope for any MC to walk and Lupe is let down by
    what is supposed to be this album's selling point: the music.
    </p>
<p>
    Reportedly Fiasco modeled <em>Food &amp; Liquor</em> after Nas' adventurous
    if overblown follow-up to <em>Illmatic</em>, <em>It Was Written</em>. This illuminates
    everything. Fiasco's putting the Phantom before the horse, so to speak. He
    hasn't released a classic, gritty album yet. Instead he's attempted to ascend to a status he hasn't earned, and frankly, shouldn't
    want. This is no call for Lupe to tone down his aggressively thoughtful themes, merely to reframe them. He doesn't have to be a savior. There's no one to save.

    The cycle of tension and release is a well-worn musical ploy, but Michigan's Wolf Eyes have somehow managed to find new ideas in that technique's cracked façade. The band's best shows are an orgiastic symphony of hypnotic build-up and cathartic discharge. Every Wolf Eyes fan knows what to expect from the latter-- distorted, decaying beats, slashing noise from John Olson and Mike Connelly, and lung-killing rants from Nate Young-- and when to pump fists and jerk heads accordingly. The more abstract sections in between are trickier. Sometimes the trio's gnarled drift stops too abruptly, other times it out-meanders its welcome. But when these scientists hit on the right formula of slow-burning anticipation, the bombast that follows has the profundity of a drug-induced epiphany.</p><p>
    Previous Wolf Eyes records have struck that magic balance during individual songs or sides, but none have stretched it over an album's length like <em>Human Animal</em>. Here the group's pre-climactic swells seem coated with extra allure, such that the first three tracks can spend 15 minutes gradually gathering density without losing momentum. It's partially due to a patient restraint that makes the clanging ""A Million Years"" oddly quiet, similar to Sightings' shadowy retreat on <em>Arrived in Gold</em>; partially due to Olson's snake-charming sax (something he's perfected with his dirt-jazz trio Graveyards) on the war-torn ""Rationed Rot""; and very much due to the way even a purely textural piece like ""Lake of Roaches"" throbs with insistent pulse, mimicking time's relentless march.</p><p>
    Whatever the reason, this dark, transfixing three-part suite makes the subsequent peak of the title track pretty staggering. ""Rusted Mange"" extends the climax with rhythms that overlap like competing fireworks. Mixed with more Young vocal screech and Olson sax whine, the piece splits the difference between didactic pound and inscrutable cacophony, delivering the promise of the preceding simmer.
    </p>
<p>
    The trio's tension-release loop gets lathered, rinsed, and repeated on <em>Human Animal</em>'s final three tracks, this time in a quicker, sharper rotation. The six-minute ""Leper War"" detonates windy bombs over a smoldering static terrain, fading into the rippling march of ""The Driller"", whose deadened pound sprouts into a hummable lurch. As Young's moans rhyme with the surrounding din, the track actually becomes more like music than noise.
    </p>
<p>
    Which makes ""Noise Not Music"" a logical closer. Here instead of noise made from pure abstraction, we get music beaten until it shatters into noise, with what sounds like 100 simultaneous punk songs piled into endless climax. The song's chanted title may be a brutal manifesto, and Wolf Eyes' metronomic swing can sometimes be fascistically either/or. But <em>Human Animal</em> is far from black and white; it's more like its melted-face cover painting, a dripping swirl of different shades of gray.

The album even opens with a minuet, and then wanders through winter mists of harpsichord, classical guitar, and nightmare cello. In other words, it's almost as pretentious as it sounds-- a cramped bedchamber's Renaissance rejoinder to Band of Horses' keening big-sky sweep.</p><p>
    Almost, but not quite. Meta-reference, set-piece titles, and shroom-faerie orchestras may put Candy Bars' songs in intellectual context, but the weird, desperate romance of the most poignant pop gives them their heart. ""Your heartbeat is as average as a lie/ I hear you're having trouble sleeping at night,"" Martinez sings on ""Violets"", a chiming acoustic lullaby comparable to fellow Floridian Iron &amp; Wine-- at least until electric guitar and sleighbell swoop in for a festival-ready chorus. Melissa Castellano's cello throbs in sympathy as Martinez bitterly confronts a lover's lies on ""The Flood in Your Old Town"", set on edge by drummer Ryan Hastings' sighing cymbals. This is sad, freezing stuff, belying the band's sunny hometown.</p><p>
    Ultimately, Candy Bars' idiosyncrasies tend to reinforce their emotionally fraught compositions. ""I wanted to create depressing heroin pop,"" goes one self-congratulatory lyric from ""Works Cited"", which opens with martial drumrolls. Still, rather than collapse beneath its own portentousness, this song sleepwalks through the band's horror-film imagination. Just when the carnival-folk foreboding seems exhausted, the villain comes back to life in the final minute. Later, ""Enough to Choke a Cold Air"" veers between stormy Southern rock verses and multitracked Elliott Smith choruses, as Martinez paints from an equally diverse palette of images: Moses, ""skyscrapers, bookshelves, milk cartons,"" and brown bears. In short, this isn't your neighbor's band bearding up after downloading <em>You Forgot It in People</em>.
    </p><p>
    Martinez's voice cuts through even when the words are shrouded in reverb, a lost boy peering out from a haunted forest. His hushed, Jeremy Enigk-like anguish has the maniacal glint of a cartoon crone, but it grounds even Candy Bars' gassiest ideas-- like uncharacteristically banal ""The Birthday Song"" or incidental-noise dirge ""The Basque Country""-- in immediacy.

    It feels like mere months-- if not weeks-- since we've last heard from Makoto Kawabata and his psych-rock juggernaut Acid Mothers Temple, and yet <em>Have You Ever Seen the Other Side of the Sky?</em> also qualifies as something of a comeback. The album marks the return of the Melting Paraiso U.F.O. ensemble from a yearlong hiatus, an interval that probably seems more like a decade on Kawabata's busy calendar. During that time Kawabata kept himself occupied by touring and recording with his newly launched heavy-rock combo the Cosmic Inferno and collaborating with the kindred spirits of Afrirampo, while also providing himself steady work as a solo artist and who-knows-what-other communal activities.</p><p>
    From an outsider's perspective the distinction between Kawabata's various groups can seem pretty much academic, since they have each undergone continuous personnel shifts and they all direct their flightpaths towards the same general regions of interstellar lunacy. Nevertheless, there seems to be a special level of expansive, full-throttle improvisation that Kawabata is only able to fully achieve with the Melting Paraiso U.F.O. at his back, and <em>Have You Seen the Other Side of the Sky?</em> rockets him right back into this fertile zone. For this album the group includes longtime AMT vets like bassist Atsushi Tsuyama and keyboardist Hiroshi Higashi, as well as newcomers like vocalist Nao (who is also charged with ""astral easy virtue"") and reed player Ryoko Ono.</p><p>
    Ono's florid interjections on flute and alto sax give much of the album an additional jolt of free-jazz ecstasy, but here as usual Kawabata and AMT are in no frame of mind to stick to any single genre for long. The acoustic ""Buy the Moon of Jupiter"" is an idyll of semi-lucid stoner folk, while ""Asimo's Naked Breakfast: Rice and Shine"" builds upon feral vocals and Kawabata's fingerpicked guitars to sculpt a meandering, Kevin Ayers-like medieval fantasia. During this track, as well as on the droning ""Interplanetary Love"", the group happens across interludes of almost startling pastoral beauty, the limpid effects of which are immediately discarded by the excellently titled thrash meltdown ""I Wanna Be Your Bicycle Saddle"". The primary downside to AMT's methodology here is that they make no effort whatsoever to integrate these radical personality splits, and so <em>Have You Seen the Other Side of the Sky?</em> contains no shadow of the intuitive cohesion the group has displayed on transcendent full-length works like <em>IAO Chant From the Cosmic Inferno</em> or <em>In C</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, no AMT release would be complete without a least one sprawling, longform freak-out, and here they present us with yet another fucking doozy. Album-closer ""The Tales of Solar Sail - Dark Stars in the Dazzling Sky"", is a half-hour epic that, like the rest of this material, appears to have been composed in several episodes. The piece opens with a simple drone of flute/recorder and hurdy-gurdy that continues long enough for one to assume nothing else is going to happen, before Kawabata finally rips into the song's sturdy central guitar riff. As has come to be expected, the bass and drums are unfortunately muffled in AMT's homegrown mix, and far too much attention is provided to Higashi's relentless sci-fi keyboard effects. But such minor details have never prevented Kawabata and company (whoever they may be) from going utterly apeshit and so they do here, raising their color-saturated wash of free-form sax and guitar like desperate S.O.S. to the heavens. It's another formidable cosmic bleat from the flock that never tires. Same time next month?

    Like a family of circus performers executing daring feats of
    acrobatics-- only with blues-- the Dickinson boys Luther and Cody form an
    unbelievably tight two-man band, assaying riffs inspired by regional bluesmen
    like Junior Kimbrough and R.L. Burnside and hitting head-of-a-pin grooves like
    nobody's business. The Dickinsons got
    together with Jon Spencer, and the result is <em>The Man Who Lives for Love</em>, which was originally released exclusively
    in Japan in
    2001 but is finally available in the States with six bonus tracks. Honestly,
    it's difficult to see what all the fuss is about. The album is fairly predictable
    and only intermittently exciting, a sprawling record that showcases what the
    Dickinson boys do best and what Spencer does all the damn time.</p><p>
    Sounding livelier here than they did as John Hiatt's backing
    band on last year's <em>Master of Disaster</em>--
    which should surprise exactly no one-- Luther and Cody open things up with the
    galloping rhythm of ""It's a Drag"" and generally try to make each song snap
    perfectly into a groove. They create a considerable commotion on ""Flood (The
    Awful Truth, The Living End)"", which sounds like those symbols cartoonists use
    for f$%^(@#$kin' cuss words. In fact, the brothers sound fiercer and more
    dangerous here than they are with their full-time band the North Mississippi
    All-Stars, who have since sunk into lackadaisical Southern jamming. And dear
    old dad-- that's legendary producer Jim Dickinson to you-- captures all the
    texture in Luther's bottleneck squalls on ""I'm Not Ready"" and Cody's snappy
    snare groove on ""Cryin'"".</p><p>
    If the Dickinson
    boys sound bolder, Spencer just sounds the same, bringing the old tics and
    mockabilly mannerisms that he's been working for years and years. He's like
    Jack Nicholson, but not in a good way: He always plays himself, no matter what
    the part calls for. Spencer always sounds best when the music is abrasively raw
    and spontaneous, with an unrehearsed amateurishness to its skuzzy noise-- see
    his original band Pussy Galore or his early Blues Explosion albums. However,
    when the music's cleaner and the musicians more capable--  here as on last year's <em>Heavy Trash</em>--  Spencer comes across as a
    cartoon, an aged Elvis impersonator drained of his musical and sexual charisma.
    The first time he barks one of his ""Yeah!""'s over Luther's
    guitar riffs on ""That's a Drag"" is, admittedly, pretty electrifying, but he
    uses that very same ""Yeah!"" to punctuate nearly every track, each grunt identical
    to the previous one. Midway through the 10-minute ham-epic ""I'm So Alone"",
    you may wonder why the hell you ever took him seriously in the first place.

    There's plenty afoot in the metal underground-- it's the mainstream
    version that desperately needs a new set of heroes. While junior-high faves Ozzy Osbourne, Guns n' Roses, and Metallica look like they could no longer eat the rich without gnawing on
    their own fatuous fingers, Mastodon are on the cusp of arena-sized success. The
    Atlanta quartet's already released two excellent full-lengths, 2002's <em>Remission</em>
    and 2004's <em>Leviathan</em>, as well as formative material in 2001's
    <em>Lifesblood</em> EP (which resurfaced earlier this year on <em>Call of the Mastodon</em>). If <em>Blood Mountain</em>,
    their brilliantly upsized and unrelenting third album, doesn't confirm their position as the greatest big-time
    metal crew on earth, I demand a state-by-state recount.</p><p>
    Anyone paying attention to heavy rock knows <em>Leviathan </em>is held in near-religious regard in metal circles-- it's an album that tops
    critical checklists <em>and </em>makes the kids shit their pants. I've spent a lot of time listening to <em>Leviathan</em> and the new record in tandem, and at first I couldn't believe it myself but...<em> Blood Mountain</em> may be
    even better. No, I'm not fucking with you. These 12 new tracks
    operate on a similar sonic
    level as their predecessors: <em>Blood Mountain</em> has the same producer, ex-Minus the Bear/current
    metal tweaker Matt
    Bayles, and though he obviously spent a lot more time layering substrata this time around, the recording's a lovely shade of dense.</p><p>
    Here, Mastodon's songwriting technique is refined, built upon, and doubled up, pushing the ingredients from their last album toward a more complex assault. It lands the band in totally fascinating realms: <em>Leviathan</em>'s post-<em>Remission</em>
    exploratory impulse
    picked up and sharpened, with the entire band playing
    rich polyrhythms at a level that (for now) appears unsurpassable. I've
    heard shouts that the record's just <em>too</em> precise. Nope. Tech for tech's sake?
    How?  Stranger yet, some have even written that <em>Blood Mountain</em> doesn't have hooks. It certainly does-- especially when those syrupy,
    psychedelic choruses and bridges
    feature increasingly stunning vocal performances by Brent Hinds and Troy Sanders,
    who've further developed as lyricists and howlers. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Leviathan</em> left listeners reaching for <em>Moby Dick</em>, on which it was based. Now ditching those literary analogues,
    <em>Blood Mountain</em> moves from the white whale to the band's Ahab-sized vision-quest up a fabled peak.  For it, the band has concocted a conceptual world-- and like any good
    game of
    Dungeons and Dragons its journey includes trials, blizzard-condition
    soul searching, cannibalism, and various beasts, including a half-sasquatch cyclops (""Circle of Cysquatch"") and a monster constructed from various smaller, leafy creatures that, together, form a forest (""Colony of Birchmen""). It's a fantastical trek, and it allows the group to remain on an
    elemental theme-- <em>Remission</em> was fire, <em>Leviathan</em> water, and <em>Blood
    Mountain</em> is earth--
    while glorying in their own Maiden-sized storytelling. Considering all the farting that takes place in the band's
    <em>Workhorse Chronicles</em> DVD, I'm afraid of what they'll do for wind. 
    </p>
<p>
    Songwise, Mastodon break out of the gate with ""The Wolf Is Loose"", a
    showcase of rapid-fire technical skill and songwriting chops. As usual, the
    guitars jab and interweave, drummer Brann Dailor melts minds with his fills, and the switch between vocalists finds the lyrics jumping from gruff gut-checks (""The belly of the whale/ Refusal of return"") to
    Sabbathian soul (""As the solider walks through the crimson
    side""). There are more compelling costume changes and time shifts
    than you can count-- and from there, it never lets up. Starting with
    Dailor, this time playing 50-gallon drums like an shadowy marching band,
    the hydra-fed
    ""Crystal Skull"" includes a blistering vocal assist from Neurosis' Scott
    Kelly. ""Sleeping
    Giant"" opens elegantly with a gloomy Isis nautical feel, before ripping into another slow psychedelic streak. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's a taut,
    flaw-free opening triad, and looking beyond it, there isn't a dud in the bunch. Highlights?
    ""Capillarian Crest"" is mathy
    prog-metal that glides unrelentingly between whip-smart crescendos.
    ""Circle of Cysquatch"" tackles dark Meshuggah-esque thrashing and includes a bleak vocoder part. Jazz-fucking instrumental ""Bladecatcher"" layers Drive
    Like
    Jehu birdcalls over crunch and classical scale-riding. Guest vocalist Josh
    Homme adds trills to ""Colony of Birchmen""'s dense fun-house mirror, providing the album's catchiest moment. The record's final few tracks are increasingly
    huge, culminating in the ""Siberian Divide"", in which our
    hero eats his own flesh when his mind is fucked by the Snow Queen.
    The Mars Volta-style intro had me nervous, but it's yet another perfect
    shapeshift between psych density and metal growl. And props where
    props are due: Cedric Bixler-Zavala contributes and actually adds an interesting vocal angle. 
    </p>
<p>
    The one misstep? After the last track,
    following 17 minutes of silence, Homme stumbles over a supposedly
    self-penned fan letter to the band: ""Dear Mastodon, my name is Joshua,
    I'm a big fan from Southern Cal. Really diggin' on your new scene.
    That's why I hope you don't mind when I got your new demos for your new
    CD, I had to sing parts on them and send them to you as a tribute,""
    etc. Dorky, yeah, but giddy enough and easily overlooked. Plan: When
    you get to the final notes of ""Pendulous Skin"", press stop and start
    again.
    </p>
<p>
    The record's liners contain mountain-climber texts that add a great old school-sized aspect to
    <em>Blood Mountain</em>, but that trek to the snowy summit could also
    refer to Mastodon's ascension of the major label monolith. On the way, they may
    not have literally battled a cyclops or scored the crystal skull (though, guessing they found some
    okay weed), but they have returned to solid ground with their most awe-inspiring album
    to date. Please welcome the new monsters of rock.

Forget your MacArthur grants, your NEA
    endowments (if they exist anymore), your humanitarian awards, and your Pulitzer
    Prizes. Elliott deserves a kind of recognition that hasn't even been
    invented yet. In contemporary hip-hop and r&amp;b, she has no peer. As a triple
    threat-- singer, songwriter, producer/arranger-- she's bested only by Prince
    and James Brown. (And her raps certainly slay Prince's, if not JB's.) Throw
    her longtime production pal Timbaland into the mix-- ""we so tight that we get
    our styles tangled""-- and those other two start getting night sweats. That she does
    all this while being a wickedly funny, openly sexual, plus-sized woman in a
    waif-sized world is just gravy. That she does it while wearing a trash bag,
    hocking loogies in her videos to the tune of backward baby elephant
    talk-- well, that's the kind of shit that makes you start to believe in
    benevolent higher beings.</p><p>
    Forget the six albums she's released over the past nine years under her own
    name and check the résumé: She penned the best songs on Aaliyah's best album-- ""One in a
    Million"" alone earning her a place in heaven-- and major hits for Tweet,
    Total, 702, Monica, Ciara, on and on. Scene-stealing guest appearances,
    videos that make you care about the art of the music video in 2006-- Missy is
    the total package in an era of Cassies and Ashantis, a great bosomy hug of
    MORE in a time of miserly, single-serving mp3 blog ""pop."" <em>Respect
    M.E.</em> is the long-awaited-- and long-deserved-- best of. It is, amazingly,
    only being released in Europe. This is unconscionable. The suits at Missy's
    American label need to have their knuckles rapped, Catechism-style. (On the
    other hand, its Euro-only status means it includes Basement Jaxx's house
    remix of ""4 My People"". Some corporate cock-ups work out in the listener's favor.)</p><p>
    The early tracks like ""Beep Me 911"" and ""The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)"" still sound like funky
    faxes from Skylab a decade later. Like, what's with all the baby robot
    gurgles where the basslines should be? Depending on your point of view,
    Timbaland either beefed up the clickety-clackety drums of southern bounce
    with New York hip-hop muscle, or he took a hole punch to DJ Premier,
    snipping every third kick drum, every sixth snare. Missy's lyrics are rarely
    ""deep""-- you know, like, uh, Pastor Troy-- and her flow continues to be mocked
    by guys (and it's always guys) who conflate grad school rhyme schemes with
    good pop. But, good as they are, appreciating Missy singles for just the
    beats is like appreciating a car for <em>just</em> the engine. You wouldn't buy
    a souped-up '87 Hyundai hatchback, right?
    </p><p>
    Missy singles are about stuff like the way she sup-sup-sups on ""Get Ur Freak
    On"", her stoned izzy izzy ah patter on ""The Rain"", all the free-associative
    babble of an Afro-psychedelic sexpot who considers the package at least as
    important as the stuff being delivered. It's the sound of her lazy, horny
    drawl on the panting, lovestruck, dumbstruck ""Hot Boyz"". It's the way she
    bounces along ""jump in this b-e-d"" on ""Sock It 2 Me"". The way her voice
    scrunches up into a cartoon sneer on all those ""e"" sounds on ""Gossip Folks"".
    It's ""to the M-I, puuurrrrr, cat like a semi."" Then there are all the little
    sonic touches, ad libs, and the cherries on top of cherries-- the ""Double
    Dutch Bus"" gibberish on ""Gossip Folks"", two of Ludacris' best-ever guest
    verses, the whole of ""Work It"".
    </p>
<p>
<em>Respect M.E.</em> isn't perfect-- my editor and I will have to respectfully
    part ways on the merits of Missy's ballads, though I suspect I'm a bigger
    sucker for gospelized cheese than he is-- but you certainly get all the hits.
    And since it samples from all of Missy's albums, it gives you more of that
    <em>more</em> than any of them will on their own. <em>Respect M.E.</em> is also,
    thankfully, non-chronologically arranged. More recent Missy singles like
    ""Pass That Dutch"" and ""I'm Really Hot"" sound much better here than they did
    on the radio where they were merely ""not as good as ‘Get Ur Freak On'."" But
    here are the caveats: The first four Missy albums are still required
    listening, I'm still not sure about greatest hits packages in an iTunes
    world, and <em>Respect M.E.</em> is probably an expensive import wherever you
    live. Still, if you're some kinda sociopath who doesn't have all these songs
    on a hard drive/iPod/discman, buy the damn thing already.

(Just listen to the venom dripping from the opening lyric of the long-distance love lament ""Excellent News, Colonel"": ""I found someone... <em>in New York</em>."") Boasting new singer and multi-instrumentalist Janie Porche-- along with armfuls of tape experiments and wiry, elaborate songs-- <em>Appreciation Night</em> is the work of a complicated, unrepentantly local band.</p><p>
    The omnipresent fuzzy guitars will feel familiar, as will singer Bobby Gallivan's lolling country-mouse delivery, but every song has frequent change-ups in rhythm and tone. Even with a track called ""Refuse the Refuse"", such conciseness is unlikely: Bound Stems will grow up to be pack-rat grandparents with stacks of <em>National Geographic</em> and tins of cat food on their divans. Their meandering was hard to sift through on last year's <em>Logic of Building the Body Plan</em> EP, a format that usually demands a band be succinct (shit, even Fiery Furnaces put their normal songs on their EPs), but here the collage approach gets a chance to breathe. Suddenly, tape experiments like ""Pulling on Pigtails"", where a vocal practice gets deconstructed over dusty tape loops, seem like a pit stop to take in the scenery rather than an indulgence.</p><p>
    The EP had two strong moments where the cut'n'paste songwriting didn't diffuse a track's momentum, and they're both reprised here. ""Wake Up, Ma and Pa Are Gone"" glides gracefully towards its final takeoff of wrist-wrecking guitar strums and yeah-yeah-yeahs. ""Risking Life and Limb"" makes Gallivan maintain while the band sputters and spurts around him before completely overwhelming him at the last minute-- yet even that sounds natural and unforced.
    </p><p>
    And that's why, even if the best songs on the EP are the best songs here, I'm not mad at them: With the context of a full record, it feels earned. Ask yourself if you want impeccable formal songcraft or if you're a listener who takes a few perfect moments from your favorite songs. The latter will suit you best for <em>Appreciation Night</em>, even if Bound Stems elect not to decide at all. All these songs are a tug-of-war of intentions-- between navel-gazing and catharsis, between pulling the covers up to your chin or opening the front door for a lungful of crisp winter air and seeing what the hell's going on outside. Sounds like Chicago to me, but chances are it sounds like your city, too.

    For those few of you salivating for the follow-up to Dr. Dog's <em>Easy Beat</em>,
    the Philadelphia-based quintet has thrown you a bone. The six-song <em>Takers
    and Leavers</em> EP previews two tracks from the band's forthcoming
    as-yet-untitled album. Unsurprisingly, those two songs stand well above the
    other four for relative quality-- which isn't much of a compliment.</p><p>
    Dr. Dog lack the vision to synthesize their influences and create an
    inimitable sound of their own. On first listen, this can actually be a little
    alluring, playing name-that-influence for each song's constituent parts. But
    on repeated listens, <em>Takers and Leavers</em> sounds more and more like
    soulless construction masquerading as homage.</p><p>
    Take the EP's best track, ""Ain't It Strange"". It's a lo-fi 1970s
    radio pop amalgam, complete with the rollicking chords of a McCartney piano
    ballad, the jangle of Beach Boys' sleigh bells, and ELO-style backing vocals on
    the chorus. Even the lyrics sound phoned in: ""Ain't it strange how
    everybody says I love you/ Ain't it a shame how a word can tell you more than
    words can say."" It could be that the band strung together a series of clichéd
    one-liners while half-listening to soft rock radio. ""Goner"", also
    from the forthcoming album, is another piano-driven throwback with a more
    earnest vocal and beefier electric guitar leads. Both songs have their
    moments-- a multi-part harmony on ""Ain't It Strange"" and a lovely
    coda on ""Goner"" stand out-- but repeat listens merely make you crave
    the originals they conjure.  
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, the rest of the EP requires much more effort to wade through.
    ""I've Just Got to Tell You"" is a bouncy novelty full of hey-look-at-me
    goofs like ""I'm always a'roamin'/ Even when I'm in Rome."" If Dr.
    Dog's dreams about being the Beatles actually came true, Ringo would sing
    this one. ""Die, Die, Die"" is the band's comic death wish, opening
    with a jilted lover trying to chain-smoke himself to death. On
    ""California"", the band decides to explore some of the most bankrupt
    lyrical territory in all of pop music. Over acoustic guitar strums, the whole
    band harmonizes on lines like, ""California/ Where the warm sun shines""
    and ""The birds keep singing/ The bells keep ringing.""   
    </p>
<p>
    The EP picks itself up slightly with the closer, ""Livin' a Dream"",
    which is closer to the two opening tracks with its soaring harmonies and
    inevitable progressions. But while Dr. Dog may succeed in capturing some semblance
    of yesterday's styles, even the EP's strongest tracks lack enough inspired
    direction to contemplate Dr. Dog as their own band, distinct and separate from

    First things first: Ryan Gosling is not in this band. At least, if he is, he's not listed in the liner notes, which would seem like a pretty big oversight, given how the band's handlers are trying their hardest to position it as the Next Big Thing in alternative rock. You can really tell the band is trying, too: Each song bursts with aplomb, from faux-prophetic title to the anthemic choruses and indie ballads. Unfortunately, none of the songs on <em>Here Is...</em> live up to their own aspirations, instead settling for bland alterna-rock. Think one part Semisonic to two parts Flickerstick and you get the idea.</p><p>
    If Gosling sound familiar, the generic songwriting might not be the only reason. In the late 1990s, Gosling were known as Loudermilk, and they played a harder edged brand of alterna-metal. When that genre fell from favor, the band punted, changing its name and sound with no one the wiser. Except that, well, they aren't any more interesting now. Maybe it's admirable that they're giving it another go, but to go through a transformation like this to end up playing just another derivative style of alternative rock seems like a waste.</p><p>
    The band tries hard to show off its classic rock influences, but rely too much on imitating instead of updating. Layered backing vocals show that the band listens to Queen. Vague, perplexing metaphors nod to Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin (""Worm Waltz"" boasts the lines, ""You can't keep the sun in a hole underground, so why does the worm feel so profound? He's in the ground."") Hell, one track, ""The Burnout"", uses ""Bennie and the Jets"" as a bridge. But Gosling never does anything with these influences that you haven't heard everywhere from late-90s alternative radio stations to recent beer and car commercials. </p><p>
    Make no mistake: Gosling have the potential to be huge. There are a lot of people out there that will love this band, love the bouncy sing-alongs, the brash vocals, and the just-tough-enough guitars. Don't be surprised to hear their music on teen dramas or find it on ""Grey's Anatomy"". But as far as hooky pop-rock goes, there are plenty of bands to choose from, and Gosling do very little to entice the listener to choose them.

    On his first two albums, DJ Shadow-- mired in memories of Eric B., Brian Eno, and the Meters-- seemed worlds away from the conceits of mainstream rap. But underneath his detached exterior lies all the egoism and paranoia of the best hip-hop stars: ""There are songs on [<em>The Outsider</em>] that I think blow away almost anything else I've ever done. One thing’s for sure-- it's going to make it very difficult for people to imitate my sound,"" Shadow posted on his website. It wasn't just talk. His new album slyly sabotages the biters: Who'd be dumb enough to copycat all this watered-down exotica and epileptic hyphy?</p><p>
    It'd be impossible to ""sound"" like Shadow anyway, since there's no consistency (or <em>any </em>distinctive elements, really) to be found here. In fact, <em>The Outsider</em> may be one of the least cohesive records this year. Its total incoherence is actually kind of impressive: It's somehow even less structured than both the motley singles comp <em>Preemptive Strike</em>, and UNKLE's <em>Psyence Fiction</em>, which managed to begin with Kool G Rap and end with Metallica's bassist.</p><p>
    So then, <em>The Outsider</em> makes a pretty apt title: This album should alienate virtually everyone who's ever been a Shadow fan. Trance divas won't tolerate its madcap hyphy collaborations, cratediggers will shun its middling alt-rock tributes, and everyone else will wonder why samples and breaks are replaced by lukewarm synth washes. Nearly every track seems like a rote genre exercise, as if Shadow spent the past four years perfecting a parlor trick. Granted, <em>The Outsider</em>'s hip-hop tracks are better than its rock-influenced ones, but that's a backhanded compliment: Shadow's tracks are so dense and claustrophobic that even the most manic MCs-- Keak Da Sneak, the Federation, and David Banner--  falter amidst the onslaught.
    </p>
<p>
    That said, the production is sometimes engrossing, and occasionally more: Both ""3 Freaks"" and ""Turf Dancing"" at times flirt with something close to genius, popping with burped blips, convulsive beats, and synthesized froth. The grinding mixes echo everything from Too $hort to <em>Computer World</em>, and the psychotically dour ""Keep 'Em Close"" spreads coked-out cant over submarine sonar and icy department-store piano. But all these songs succumb to lazy speak-sing choruses that dull the clinical anger of their verses.
    </p>
<p>
    The record peaks with David Banner's elegy to New Orleans.  Part séance, part TV-movie, Banner's performance perversely resembles Katrina itself: Everything gets a hell of a lot whiter when it's over. Suddenly, the high-adrenaline hip-hop bids us adieu, to be replaced mostly by monotonous alt-rock instrumentals that play like a tour through mid-90s KROQ playlists. The Martin Denny vibe (complete with birdcalls!) of ""The Tiger"" is completely insufferable; the Southeast Asian strings of ""Triplicate/Something Happened That Day"" are littered with amateur field recordings; and while ""You Made It"" (featuring Charalambides' Christina Carter) is patently ridiculous, at least its ostentatious spoken-word will be familiar to Shadow fans. The same can't be said of ""Erase You""'s insipid Britpop bullshit. The only rock-tinged success here is ""Artifact""-- and its smoldering acceleration, funk synths, and pent-up thrash might as well be a mash-up of the Count Five and Bad Brains.
    </p>
<p>
    Again, most listeners won't have the luxury of praising or penalizing Shadow for his efforts. It's difficult to even discern whether his recent interest in pop production might prove rewarding with the benefit of hindsight. Nearly everything this record offers-- from the garbled hyphy to the <em>Private Press</em> soundalikes-- is lackluster, if not downright disappointing. Incoherence is not necessarily a fatal flaw, but accompanied by tedium and confusion, <em>The Outsider</em> sounds like a chore-- to record, to listen to, and to review.

While Metric's pedestrian neu wave often glosses over Haines' political and feminist tracts, <em>Knives</em> delves into her incisive gloom full-bore-- and her misery is good company. Metric's clunky riffage and hi-hat beats are replaced by simple piano figures and subtle adornments (strings, feedback, breathing organ) that draw out Haines' most stirring vocal performances to date, and the muted milieu highlights her natural, sensuous whisper, lending a sympathetic thrust to these broken-down anthems for a thirtysomething girl.</p><p>
    The daughter of an admired jazz poet, Haines takes advantage of the solo spotlight, crafting words that mix her world-weary bite with newly homed ambiguities and painful self-awareness. ""I really don't relate to the female singer-songwriter,"" Haines said in a recent <em>Under the Radar</em> interview. ""You're all precious and everyone has to hush while you go over the shadows of your emotions. I've always hated that."" The sentiment is admirable but misleading; while obviously taken with Chan Marshall and Juliana Hatfield confessionals, Haines adds her own peeking shadows-- coping with her father's sudden death, the instability of life on the road, and the currently confused feminist fight-- that make <em>Knives</em>' piano elegies dark like diary entries inked during anxious, sleepless nights.</p><p>
    As her surroundings crumble, Haines attempts to make sense of the ruin. Struck through the singer's prism of pessimism, her role as the driving force behind a successful indie act becomes emotionally ravaging on ""Crowd Surf Off a Cliff"". Dismayed with success (""it won't be enough to be rich""), contemplating two-and-a-half-kids normalcy (""All the babies tucked away in their beds, we're out here screaming, 'The life that you thought through is gone!'""), and exhausted by long-distance love (""You'd better make it quick 'cause this call costs a fortune and it's late where you live""), Haines doesn't seem ungrateful as much as drained.
    </p><p>
    There's no breathing room on <em>Knives</em>, no hint of forced uplift. Even when Haines seems to run from her own life with the dreamy observations of ""Reading in Bed"", she's quick to catch herself: ""With all the luck you've had why are your songs so sad?"" Though the unyielding dourness of death marches like ""The Last Page"" and ""Nothing &amp; Nowhere"", and confusing hallucinations like ""Detective Daughter"" add little to the minor-chord canon, Haines employs a skillful cast-- including Metric's Jimmy Shaw and Sparklehorse's Scott Minor-- to add textural variation. Both ""The Lottery"", a lament addressing the regression of feminist ideals, and the anti-pharmaceutical diatribe ""Doctor Blind"" benefit from flittering strings and distorted echoes that sounds like Jonny Greenwood climbing up the walls. At its most haunted, the album is reminiscent of Elliott Smith's final compositions, with Haines' voice sunken and drifting.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Knives </em>starkly places Haines' vulnerabilities on view. It's a brave move that trumps her usual combative cleverness with Metric. On the closing track, ""Winning"", she offers the album's loveliest lullaby melody and inherits the role of comforting parent: ""What's bad?/ We'll fix it/ What's wrong?/ We'll make it alright/ It's gone/ We'll find it/ Takes so long/ We've got time, all the time."" The brief respite from sullen existentialism is defensive but palpable; a deep, stipulation-filled grin-and-bear-it. But while often excruciating, <em>Knives</em>' catharsis is mostly inclusive. As a sobering meditation on modern melancholy, it's mired in loss but never completely loses.

    Brazilian Girls' biggest accomplishment is pretty much the same thing as
    their biggest problem, and it's that they have no audience. They have fans,
    yes-- devoted ones-- but there's no coherent market for them to aim at. They
    have their swank global groove, but they're too arty to home in on worldbeat
    fans or VIP loungers. They make freethinking dance music, but their grooves are
    too earthy to count on the electronic crowd, and they're too upscale, too
    going-out-music, to count on rock geeks. They play singles anyone could love,
    but they're just plain too weird to make it all converge on the Billboard
    charts.</p><p>
    So they're caught between a lot of worlds-- bohemians in carpenters' pants,
    bottle service, National Public Radio, fashion design, Herbert remixes,
    Bonaroo. People I've met who like them include a rapper, a woman who always
    knows about new restaurants, and a guy who's in love with Patti Smith. They
    call themselves ""Brazilian Girls"", but if there's any beach they
    sound like, it's closer to Monte Carlo. I imagine this is how Talking Heads
    must have felt, for a while.</p><p>
    Well, but: The best art creates its own audience (that's what they say), and so
    the fear with this second album was that Brazilian Girls might get impatient
    about it-- start catering to one crowd or another, possibly the <em>wrong </em>crowd.
    Terrific news: They haven't. <em>Talk to la Bomb</em>, in fact, swings in exactly
    the right directions. They've mostly laid off the kinda guilt-inducing
    call-and-response jams on their first record-- crowd-pleasing remnants from
    their time as a working house band, most of which came off a little lame on
    disc. What we get instead, actually, is far more imaginative with the
    electronics, and with the studio space.</p><p>
    It's special, really, and it certainly befits a band with this lineup: one
    glamorous, expressive, and very human-sounding singer, one well-trained rhythm section,
    and just one guy on keyboards and samplers to fill in the rest. This is a
    recipe for completely blurring the distinctions between a live band and an
    electronic act, and it's also a straight route to variety: ""Jique"",
    the album's first single, gets to kick off with a homey electro groove, then
    swell into an airy blur of strings and angels for the chorus, all without some
    guitar player wandering around it trying to figure out what to do. It sounds
    better the more mellow and inorganic it gets-- the gorgeous
    ""Sweatshop"" is their most laidback moment yet, only detailed with
    enough thrilling drum programming to make you break out your headphones. And
    it's all even more terrifically Mediterranean than before.</p><p>
    Still, though, this band retains all the odd qualities that keep it from
    sounding anything like an actual electronic act. Sabina Sciubba's voice seems
    too lazy and down-to-earth for it, as does her sense of humor: ""Tourist
    Trap"" has town guests pissing in the ocean and puking outside the casinos,
    while ""Never Met a German"" tries to draw black comedy out of war
    lust. (Not sure where an Italian woman gets off playing Germans for war lust,
    but we endeavor to be open-minded.) Even when they're playing straight house
    music (""Le Territoire""), there's some sort of stage implied-- by the
    muso bass playing, by the loose drum fills-- that keeps them sounding like
    people. Clever ones, even.</p><p>
    None of which is to say that the album's an absolute marvel. Sophisticated as
    all this is, bits of it still flop, and other bits seem like they've gone
    overboard on the sophistication: They're too slick, too showily multilingual,
    or too noodly-- on ""Rules of the Game"", too Édith Piaf. (For a few
    seconds, here and there, we might be tempted to imagine an audience for them,
    one consisting largely of Eurotrash and guys who play fretless bass.) Judging
    by the band's progression from first album to second, these don't seem like
    problems they're likely to get over quickly. But it's worth hoping they manage
    to bring together a non-theoretical audience nonetheless, because their best
    work is still too likeable to fall between the cracks: between music geeks who
    think they're too swank and jammy, Bebel Gilberto fans who think they're too
    coarse and noisy, jam-band enthusiasts who want more solos...

    If only J. Robbins could find a band that works as hard as he does. After
    Jawbox called it quits, Burning Airlines made one incredible record-- a
    near-perfect balance between musicianship and satisfying hooks-- and one
    confused one, a sophomore slump from a shifting lineup that may have eventually found its footing. Instead, band members keep evaporating on Robbins, leaving him to do decidedly
    un-punk-rock things like have families and hold down 9-to-5 jobs. Robbins,
    however, has done them one better by starting his own family while staying
    active as a prolific producer and an occasional musician. Slow on the heels of a
    2004 EP is <em>Waiting for the Next End of the World</em>, the first
    full-length from Robbins in five years and the first from Channels, a trio
    featuring co-vocalist Janet Morgan (aka Mrs. Robbins) from Shonben and drummer Darren
    Zentek of Oswego and Kerosene 454.</p><p>
    Robbins' time spent behind the production boards rather than in front of them pays off here:
    Channels' LP is an immaculate-sounding rock record, flipping through a library
    of hair-raising sci-fi guitar tones over an ever-crisp rhythm section. The
    guitar in ""Licensee"" alone stings like a toothache and then
    slides backward on its heels in the chorus. The bass work on this record, heavier than Robbins is used
    to while still remaining limber, is nothing to sneeze at, but Morgan is more a
    backup singer than a real songwriting foil-- a role Robbins benefits from. (See: The difference between the first and second BA records.)</p><p>
    Still, Robbins deserves credit for upping his lyrical game by more than a
    few notches. He's been prone to abstraction, but now Channels' songs are
    political without being topical, and paranoid without being heavy-handed, with
    far more pithy one-liners per capita (e.g. on ""Mayday"" he quips, ""Every
    survivor story reeks of alibis"").
    </p>
<p>
    It's a shame that all of that is applied to songs that sound mannered at
    best, and often clunky. ""Savory"" aside, Robbins' has never been a
    murderer at midtempo, and very few of these songs pick up the pace, bogged down by meandering melodies and hooks too obtuse to really land. The
    best moments are those that have the slightest trace of sweat: The trade off
    between he and Morgan over Morse-code bursts of distortion in ""Licnesee"", the landmine bob of ""Mayday"", the very-BA ""Chivaree"", or the
    floating near-psychedelia of ""Helen Mirren"".
    </p>
<p>
    Not a bad batting
    average, but even the blistering ""$99.99"" seems buttoned-up somehow,
    and everything else is aimed straight into Robbins' comfort zone. <em>Waiting
    for the Next End of the World</em> has all the trademarks of his previous
    projects, excepting the melody or the bite. There's nothing here that'll
    disappoint his well-earned fanbase, but that's all he's playing to as that
    section of the populace slowly dwindles with each year in between projects. If
    only he'd book a few less mediocre emo bands and put the baby down on the
    boards; we could always use more of Robbins' A-game.

    The Big Sleep are a trio from Brooklyn that play robotic, hypnotic, and
    mostly instrumental post-rock. Their name fits better than perhaps they'd like;
    while <em>Son of the Tiger</em>, the band's debut, is not going to kill you, you might
    find your mind wandering as it plays, only to snap back and realize that two
    songs have passed. The songs aren't dynamic-- they pick one melody, one mood,
    or one rhythm, and ride it out-- but sometimes a driving groove gets a
    mesmerizing hook in you and threatens to never let go.</p><p>
    Six of these 10 tracks are instrumentals, ranging from dark and gloomy to
    raucous and explosive. Big Sleep find most success within the tight framework
    of head-bobbing rhythm and buzz-saw guitars, as on opener ""Brown
    Beauty"", with its wash of fuzz and jerking beat. ""You Can't Touch the
    Untouchable"", a Trans-Am-esque stomper, built on menacing, droning
    guitar effects, is another winner. And the disc's strongest moment is the
    rollicking ""Are You Ready (For Love)?"" Over the course of its four
    minutes, it builds from low-key guitar blips to a cascade of drum fills and
    noisy melody.</p><p>
    The vocal songs are hit-or-miss. ""Murder"" makes great use of Sonya
    Balchandani's sultry monotone; even though her voice is mixed low, it remains
    the focal point. ""Shima"", on the other hand, features her voice right up
    front, dueling with the noodling guitar and droning bass and keys. Both of
    these tracks work, and neither strays far from the style developed in the
    disc's instrumental half. But ""SKB"", a dreamy, bluesy number, never
    gets off the ground, and the title track feels like an ""Are You Ready (For
    Love?)"" redux with buried vocals tacked on. Regardless, there are a few
    great songs on <em>Son of the Tiger</em>, though it may take a few listens for the
    disc's charms to work on you.

From his first releases as
    Palace Music, Oldham's whiskey-soaked vocals and lyrical obsessions with
    death, sex, and religion have made ""maturity"" something of a non-issue.
    And yet, with his most recent couple of releases as Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, the
    aesthetic antiquity of his earliest recordings seems to have slowly given
    way to a more mundane sense of age. On <em>The Letting Go</em>, the humor,
    dread, and resignation that inform Oldham's music are
    presented in blissfully unfiltered form, and whether the proximity one feels is to person or persona is
    ultimately irrelevant; either way, <em>The Letting Go</em> feels <em>close</em>.</p><p>
    With its pristine recording and prominent female backing vocals, opener
    ""Love Comes to Me"" evokes  Oldham's 2003 album <em>Master and Everyone</em>.
    Thankfully, the sound of <em>The Letting Go </em>proves to be more
    inviting and striking than that of its predecessor, as Oldham and Faun Fables vocalist
    Dawn McCarthy invariably find their way to beautiful moments-- even when
    the songs themselves aren't particularly engrossing. A late autumn
    stroll through the woods might not be the most exciting metaphor for an
    album, but it's a rare treat to hear something this organic and cozy<em></em>.</p><p>
    In fact, <em>The Letting Go</em> is so confident that its strangeness could
    easily go unnoticed. But this is, in many ways, one of the weirdest
    records Oldham has ever released. McCarthy's vocals never really
    coalesce into a distinct relationship with Oldham's-- she slips in and
    out of harmonies, backing parts, doubles, and absences. The album's
    arrangements are similarly elusive-- the string swells and ominous drums
    on ""The Seedling"" wash incongruously against McCarthy's vocals. And yet, nothing ever seems jarringly out of place.
    </p><p>
    Generally speaking, this is true of the album's sequencing as well.
    Though the more lo-fi and bluesy ""Cold &amp; Wet"" is a noticeable shift from
    the rest of the record, it's by no means unwelcome after the
    perhaps-too-understated ""No Bad News"". On the whole, <em>The Letting Go</em> is amazingly consistent, Oldham and McCarthy meandering tunefully
    through subtle but effective changes in texture and tone. Unlike
    Oldham's best work, <em>The Letting Go</em> doesn't pull you into its
    own emotional world; it doesn't ask much, and you're free to take as
    much from it as you'd like. The beauty and eccentricity of <em>The Letting
    Go</em> doesn't provoke deep absorption or self-reflection so much as a kind
    of fond familiarity.

Captained as always by singer/songwriter Joel Gibb, the group's latest album, <em>AWOO</em>, drops much of the doo-doo and the harps'n'horns extravagance of its predecessors in order to hump the crowded indie pop center like a musical David Broder.</p><p>
    ""We're entering a new Dark Age,"" Gibb told an interviewer back when the U.S. was about to finish off Iraq's last few ""Baathist dead-enders."" Two years later, of course, the world seems even more apropos of Gibb's golden showers and orchestra-swathed enemas, even if those still come across gimmicky. Nor is it ever too late for pointed, witty political salvos like 2003's ""Ban Marriage""-- <em>O'Reilly Factor</em>ers' phony ""gay agenda"" phobia <em>ad absurdum</em> and still the Hidden Cameras' blissful apex. What we get instead is a four-letter onomatopoeia of sorts (""AWOO"") and the band's typical ""Lion Sleeps Tonight"" high notes on some Barenaked Ladies fast-singing pop/rock trip, exacerbated by production glossy enough for a Dell commercial.</p><p>
<em>AWOO</em> finds the Hidden Cameras prettier than ever, but with little personality and less of the haunted subtext that shadowed previous albums' sunniest tunes. ""Silence from you is like the death of a tune,"" begins Gibb's clipped, John Darnielle-esque voice on ""Death of a Tune"", as staccato surf-rock guitar jousts with gently sloping violin. Meanwhile, hand-clapping ""AWOO"" incorporates chutes-and-ladders glockenspiel, an annoyingly repetitive title refrain, and absurdist lyrics that, based on the video, may or may not have something to do with wolves. Didgeridoo-enhanced ""She's Gone"" and baroque ballad ""Heaven Turns To"" lean closer to the band's AM-pop side, while the rattling Velvets riffs on ""Learning the Lie"" and the singing-alarm-clock trills of ""Lollipop"" rock more, relatively speaking.
    </p>
<p>
    There's little here that couldn't have been on previous albums; the difference is what's gone missing: the in-your-face homosexuality of Rough Trade debut <em>The Smell of Our Own</em>, the perverse grandiosity of 2004's <em>Mississauga Goddam</em>. Which isn't to say <em>AWOO</em> might not somehow be subtly subversive beneath its tame exterior, though no amount of mumbled Jung or Genesis references can save a pop album from drifting down the middle of the road. Finale ""The WAning mOON""-- get it-- again evokes wolves, on a willowy bed of softest piano and the title track's familiar chords: ""I never thought we would end this way,"" Gibb murmurs. I guess it all depends what your definition of ""AWOO"" is.

    Christina Carter has been so prolific over her 15-plus year career-- both as a member of Charalambides and with her various solo ventures-- that it might seem like the law of averages should dictate that she is overdue for an outright misfire. Yet with her latest solo release<em> Electrice</em>, Carter has once again bucked the odds, displaying anew her uncommon ability to slip almost invisibly between the spheres of the subconscious and the waking world. As with much of her work, <em>Electrice</em> is a study in quiet contrasts-- born of improvisation, but carefully edited and sculpted at the mixing board with layered vocal overdubs and time-stretching sonic effects. Recorded and mixed by Carter herself in Northampton, Mass., the album's four extended drones each share a profound sense of dislocation and existential yearning, as though these ethereal songs were constructed in full knowledge of their own fragility and impermanence.</p><p>
    Carter's music has always been marked by certain simplicity of form, and on <em>Electrice</em> she has further refined that simplicity by recording all these songs in the same key and using the same guitar tuning. Even with these self-imposed restrictions, however, her music sounds nothing like the product of a closed system. Unlike the more folk-based improvisations that appeared on her previous Kranky solo collection <em>Living Contact</em>, Carter here makes fuller use of her electric guitar's resonant frequencies, allowing her piano-like chords to linger and fold back upon themselves until they shape a fabric of elongated, overlapping drones. Against this hushed backdrop Carter's multi-tracked voice acquires an open-ended shimmer-- her often-wordless vocals so intertwined with her abstract guitar figures that at points it becomes difficult to gauge which is which.</p><p>
    ""My language will not die/ A second death/ It is gone,"" sings Carter on the transfixing opener ""Second Death"", perhaps as a means of giving voice to the ephemeral nature of the improviser's art. Soon enough her words do indeed fall away, her song slowly dissolving into a circular eddy of chiming guitar overtones and spectral wailing. Without losing their patient stride, her repeating chords then segue naturally into the following ""Moving Intercepted"". On this track the album's climate of dispossession takes a metaphysical turn, with Carter appearing to address an audience of unseen spirits as she asks, ""Will I be moving? Will I be undone? Do you think the body is a comfort?"" with expectant fervor. 
    </p>
<p>
    Conversely, the lyrics of ""Yellow Pine"" are stripped of all forward action, as Carter instead turns inward to offer what resembles a Gertrude Stein rhythmic tone poem. Underscored by flickering, unidentifiable drones, the piece appears shadowed by a dark, almost impassable stillness. ""Yellow dress/ All the time/ Yellow pine/ No pines,"" Carter sings in an otherworldly, trancelike whisper, as though spontaneously delivering the words as they are revealed to her, the objects of the lyrics seemingly as mysterious to herself as they are to the listener. This sense of channeling is further confirmed by album closer ""Words Are Not My Own"", which finds Carter offering her individual song back to universal wellspring from which it came, asking the listener, ""Are your words my words?"" It's another eerie, captivating performance from an artist whose career is studded with such memorable séances. And as long as she's to retain such ready access to this fertile spiritual realm, perhaps Carter will prove able to postpone that mid-career slump indefinitely.

    The return of Eric Matthews feels like randomly hearing from an old friend
    for the first time in ten years. Maybe you wondered about that person from time
    to time, but you never expected to cross paths again. You thought they'd probably changed in all that time, but they really haven't. And as much as
    you hate to admit it, in spite of all that's happened, you're still pretty much
    the same, too.</p><p>
    Which is to say: Where've you been, Eric? After leaving Cardinal, you kicked out two pretty good
    albums in the mid-1990s and then disappeared after 97, only to suddenly
    resurface last year with a seven-song EP. And now, a year later, with a 17-song album. With a five-song EP attached to the limited edition. That
    is a ton of songs, and what's more, they sound pretty much exactly like the
    stuff you were releasing 10 years ago.</p><p>
<em>Foundation Sounds</em> is precisely what you'd expect from Eric Matthews: Meticulously crafted indie pop songs with fey vocals, sometimes harmonized, and
    occasional orchestration-- mostly in the form of trumpet. If you've heard Matthews' work, you already know what this sounds like; likewise, if
    you enjoyed his old stuff, you'll almost certainly like this as well. 
    </p>
<p>
    Matthews might have considered splitting his 22 new songs into two albums,
    because my main problem with this record is that there's way too much of it. I
    keep getting lost in the running order, which also says something about the
    uniformity of the songs. ""Start of the Meltdown"", which
    deserves a lot of listens with its slow-motion horn arrangement and confoundingly
    memorable melody, is buried at track 13, and
    there's still more to come after that. The back end of the record is the most
    interesting stretch, actually, busting out the harpsichord for ""The
    Fly"", a quick romp through the garden of 60s orch-pop, jaunty trumpet solo
    and all, and changing the feel up for closer ""Till This Story Ends"",
    a cavernous ballad that opens with a long, billowy cornet figure before
    Matthews brings his vocals in with lines like ""I don't see your face/ No
    soul, no sex, no oxygen."" 
    </p>
<p>
    The lyrics are all like that-- fragmented, somewhat impressionistic, and not
    terribly important to the overall success of the songs. The vocal usually seems
    intended as just another instrument, which works on and off. Opener ""Our
    House"" demonstrates both extremes, with a memorable hook redeeming an
    otherwise rather blah tune. It's odd-- when his melodies don't work, it's as
    though he's become a victim of his own formalism, writing notes before singing
    them to see if they catch the ear. ""The Death of in Between"", a
    mostly acoustic song with a brief horn part, is a perfect example. Its melody
    does the things a melody is supposed to do-- going up and down, balancing long
    notes against short ones-- but it's totally forgettable, delivered with studied
    awareness of where the notes are, but not what to do with them. 
    </p>
    So
    if Matthews has picked up the baton from exactly where he left it, he's lost some of his running ability. But this goes partially back
    to the record's length-- if the less-eventful songs were cleared out, we'd have
    a much more solid overall outing. As it is, we've got an old friend back, still
    doing and saying all the same things, and it brings a strange mix of comfort
    and sadness.</div>"|9391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9391-foundation-sounds/|6.4|Joe Tangari

    If 1996's <em>Trainspotting</em>
    soundtrack was the Britpop generation's <em>Saturday Night Fever</em>, London quartet
    Scanners seem to be holding out hope for a <em>Staying Alive</em> sequel. Everything
    about ""Joy"", the first song on their first album, reeks of being 10 years past
    its best-before date: Sarah Daly lays on the ultra-vixen shtick extra thick (""My
    love leaves a permanent stain/ I'm in love with my digital toy,"" she informs us
    with a curled-lip purr) while her band plods away in a PVC-sleek synth-grunge grind
    that could've easily scored them the opening slot on an Elastica/Garbage bill, provided
    Republika or Sleeper weren't available. The chorus simply repeats the title ""Joy""
    over and over again, but the feeling is nowhere to be had here, unless you
    still hang out in bars with ultraviolet lighting. On paper, second track ""Lowlife""
    appears equally dubious: It shares a title with a New Order album and takes its
    chorus line (""this is a low"") from a Blur song. But remarkably, it sounds like
    the work of another band entirely. With its repeated, mournful guitar figure, motorik
    rhythm, well-timed violin strokes, and pensive lyrics about mortality, the song
    is everything its predecessor isn't: vulnerable, heartfelt, and, bleak subject
    matter aside, quite joyous.</p><p>
    Good thing they made it the
    first single, though those lured into <em>Violence Is Golden</em> by ""Lowlife""'s bookish
    charms should prepare themselves for a series of shocks and about-faces; the aforementioned
    1-2 opening miss/hit combo is but a microcosm of this brazenly inconsistent debut.
    One band's inspired eclecticism is another's existential crisis: Scanners sound
    like they can't decide if they want to pump out strobe-lit catwalk background noise
    for the Cobrasnake set (""Raw""), help wayward goth kids wean themselves off
    Evanescence and onto PJ Harvey (""In My Dreams"", ""Changing Times""), sell the
    records that the Sounds failed to (""Bombs""), or out-scum the Kills and Duke
    Spirit (""Air 164"").</p><p>
    And yet Daly's comfortable
    shifts from sneering to endearing, combined with Scanners' eagerness to use
    each song as a blank slate for markedly different arrangements (""Evil Twin""
    even introduces acoustic raga rhythms and slide-guitar psychedelia), carry
    with them the hope that the band will cast aside its more contrived poses and
    discover their natural voice. And in the album's last two songs, they finally find
    it. And blimey, it sounds a hell of a lot like the Cardigans: ""Look What You
    Started"" is a grand country-soul break-up ballad completely out of step with
    everything that comes before it, but Daly's wistful croon and Mat Mole's
    gleaming guitar line come together as gracefully as lovers running slow motion in
    a field; the closing title track serves as the darker sequel where the trysts
    turn to fists, its waltzing gait given a mean beating by an incessant, scabrous
    guitar riff. <em>Violence Is Golden</em> may start out dull as brass, but it's got a
    24-karat conclusion.

    The first thing you need to know is that neither of the two sets--
    the one disc set of previously released material nor the collector's edition
    with an extra disc of live tracks, rarities, and demos-- has ""Romance"" on it.
    So you'll want to hang on to the now out-of-time <em>Eponymous</em>, or at least burn the song before you sell the disc. The
    second thing you need to know is that the second disc contains a favorite track
    from each member, and Stipe chooses ""Time After Time (AnnElise)"", quite
    possibly to piss off Stephen Malkmus (how's that for a little bit of indie
    arcana?).</p><p>
    After that, you probably know everything you need to know: how the
    band was started by four UGA students; how their enigmatic frontman
    occasionally sang in a mumble; how he wrote impressionistic lyrics that made
    obfuscation a virtue; how the drummer played close to the chest to give the
    songs their tightly wound tension; how the guitarist updated Roger McGuinn's
    Americana strum; how they released a five-song EP and then a near-perfect full-length debut in 1983,
    followed by four more excellent albums, a rarities comp, and the aforementioned <em>Eponymous</em> on I.R.S. Records, before
    signing to Warner Brothers; how during those years they embodied Southern
    locality, effectively pinpointing Athens, Georgia, as a hotbed of indie
    music; how they eventually traded that locality for national and then global
    generality, the music suffering as their scope widened; how you and me and
    maybe every one else who heard <em>Around the
    Sun</em> wished the band would either pack it all in or take $500 and whatever
    equipment they could carry and record their next album in some kudzu-covered
    barn in the middle of rural Georgia.</p><p>
    As disappointing as their Warner Brothers trajectory has
    proved, R.E.M.'s I.R.S. years were a period of sustained and boundless creativity,
    which makes <em>And I Feel Fine</em>
    inevitably enthralling, and hearing these songs in the context of a late-career
    retrospective feels undeniably rewarding. In short, there's not a bad song on
    this tracklist. Hell, there's not even a single merely good song on here. <em>And I Feel Fine</em> is 42 mind-blowing
    tracks from a band that helped to define and codify indie rock.
    </p>
<p>
    With startling obviousness, Disc 1 begins with ""Begin the
    Begin"", the<em> Lifes Rich Pageant</em>
    opener, and spirals outward with no regard for chronology. ""Begin"" is one of R.E.M.'s
    rock songs (the kind they tried to replicate on <em>Monster</em>), and it immediately showcases their elemental sound,
    each instrument carrying democratic weight and creating a surprisingly
    aggressive whole, topped by Stipe's alternately precise enunciations and Weird Harold
    growls and barks. R.E.M. were an intuitively tight unit, a fact that often gets
    lost in the legend: Bill Berry, Peter Buck, and Mike Mills were a power trio, all rhythm
    section but all lead, and their expansive musical vocabulary-- encompassing power
    pop, folk, soul, classic rock, and even punk-- proved surprisingly malleable
    over time. The group was as dynamic on an early track like ""Radio Free Europe"" and the gentle
    ""Perfect Circle"" as on the countrified ""Can't Get There From Here"" and
    deceptive rock songs like ""Life and How to Live It"" and ""The One I Love"", with
    its contradictory declarations of romantic devotion and manipulation.
    </p>
<p>
    If the band was a traditional, yet inventive, three-piece,
    who knows what Stipe was? Possessed of a roomy, plainspoken tenor that could
    rise into a plaintive keen, he adopted new approaches for each song, sounding
    withdrawn on ""Perfect Circle""
    or mimicking a hick accent on ""Can't Get There from Here"". His fragile falsetto
    sounds like it could break on ""Feeling Gravitys Pull"", the perfect compliment
    to Buck's question-mark guitar chords. Stipe liked to adopt the posture of
    Southern enigma, but it was less a stance than an elusive ploy. He turned
    regional vernacular into lyrical puzzles, reading rural Georgia culture as
    poetry and philosophy, incorporating colloquialisms like ""I will rearrange your
    scales"" and ""can't get there from here"" (and later, more famously, ""losing my
    religion"") into lyrics that prized vexing obscurity and absorbing complexity,
    settling for no set meanings but only open-ended impressions. Remarkably, he
    sounded like he belonged to this marginal culture, writing and singing his
    songs with absolutely no class or intellectual condescension or any trace of
    irony, which seems sadly impossible today.
    </p>
<p>
    What's missing from Disc 1 are the album tracks that
    comprise the darker corners of the R.E.M. catalog, which, it could be argued,
    are the true essence of the band's legend. For this reason, the second disc of <em>And I Feel Fine</em>, heavy with less
    canonical songs but compiled with obvious care, proves just as revelatory and
    representative as the first: The tracklist presents a subterranean history of
    the band to complement the popular legend. Disc 2 has a palindromic symmetry,
    beginning and ending with band members' personal picks. ""Pilgrimage"" (Mills),
    ""These Days"" (Berry), and
    ""Disturbance at the Heron House"" (Buck) could just as easily have been
    first-disc hits, but ""Time After Time"" remains a strange avenue (although
    Stipe's affection for it seems understandable, like a mother's love for the
    runt of the litter). The second and penultimate sets of songs include alternate
    takes, demos, and unreleased rarities, including Hib-tone versions of two <em>Murmur</em> tracks, a wonderful slowed-down
    version of ""Gardening at Night"", and early demos of later tracks ""All the Right
    Friends"" and ""Bad Day"".
    </p>
<p>
    But it's the center of Disc 2 that's the true prize of
    the set: four live tracks that amount to a concert of sorts. These songs, three
    from 1983 and one from 87, show the band as a fierce and tight live act, Stipe
    commanding the stage (his lengthy spoken-word intro to ""Life and How to Live
    It"" is a beaut) and the band muscling (yes, muscling) up behind him with
    celebratory bravado. At so few tracks this section is just a tease, but it
    raises two important questions: First, in their storied two-decade-plus career,
    why the hell haven't R.E.M. released a live album? And second, when they do, can
    it be a double?

    Can it really be five years since Kompakt's <em>Total 3</em> compilation so dramatically won over the world at large to Germany's brand of minimal house? Listening to that seminal record back-to-back with <em>Total 7</em>-- Kompakt's latest round-up of vinyl releases and exclusive tracks-- the distance feels negligible. In fact, the patient unfurling of the label's sonic signature-- not to mention its continuing currency in dance circles-- is testament to the curious slowness with which this decade marches forward: While the label remains at the forefront of house and techno, it has done so by entrenching itself at the center of frantic back-and-forth movements within German dance music circles, shoring up its perennial fashionability rather than indulging in trailblazing daring.</p><p>
    Inevitably, this latest 2xCD overview lacks the air of excitement and anticipation which surrounded earlier editions-- that sense that Kompakt's vision was expanding forever outward, stealing and digesting a wealth of ideas from across the pop and dance music landscape. Having undergone no radical stylistic overhauls, the label's output now has the comforting familiarity of an old friend. Which is a shame, as <em>Total 7</em> is as strong as any in the series to date, besting its immediate predecessor in the consistency of its enchantment-- there is something to like in all 24 tracks here, itself a quietly remarkable feat.</p><p>
    Ranging from the cheerful demolition of Hug's aptly-titled ""The Happy Monster"" to the shimmering calm of Superpitcher's ""Tonite"", <em>Total 7</em> exhibits an unassuming diversity nearly as broad as the German house spectrum itself, but such open-mindedness sounds less startling than you'd expect. Inclusions are cherry-picked from numerous sub-labels-- the self-explanatory Kompakt Pop, the muscular surge of the Speicher series, and the thick, spiky tech-house of recent addition K2-- but here the divisions between the sub-labels feel arbitrary, more shifts in emphasis than radical transformations of identity. For once, there are no harshly grating noise experiments, but conversely the occasional flirtations with pop songfulness are more measured than before; while vocals grace several tracks, they are deployed strictly to complement the underlying propulsive grooves rather than attract attention to themselves. Simultaneously, the smattering of tracks from the K2 imprint reveal a more confident mastery of the straightforward dancefloor bomb, from the chugging organ melodrama of Steadycam's ""Knock-Kneed"" to the ubiquitous snake-hip wiggle of Gui Boratto's ""Arquipélago"".
    </p>
<p>
    But this is not where the label's heart lies. The drifting melancholy of Kontrast's ""Grey Skies to Blue"", the aching chords of Jonas Bering's ""Melanie"", the sparkling technicolor chime-loop confectionary of SCSI-9's ""When She Said Goodbye"", and the tremulous fragility of the Rice Twins' ""For Penny &amp; Alexis"" are testament to the solidity of Kompakt's core aesthetic. All variations around a theme of Detroit-inspired soft-centred emotionalism, those tracks' sleekly gentle beats and deliquescing synth patterns unambiguously choose romanticism over innovation and tear ducts over sweat glands. This willingness to revel in hyper-melodic soppiness has always been a Kompakt calling-card, but never has it seemed to define the label's identity so thoroughly as it does now. Not that we should complain-- I suspect this particular sonic blueprint will remain heart-meltingly seductive no matter how many <em>Total</em> compilations we are blessed with. And there are glimpses of life and change even here: The compilation's best track, the Field's ""Over the Ice"", twists this overbearing emotionalism into shapes hitherto unseen, with vocal samples from what appears to be Kate Bush's ""Under Ice"" cut up and looped into a strobing, sighing house epic, glistening with intermingled grief and longing.

    Those of you who have stayed up late watching ESPN2 may have stumbled across a very unusual bit of television: The Whitest Boy Alive competition.  Contestants from around the globe (the middle latitudes, at least) battle in a series of events designed to judge the breadth and depth of their Caucasianness, facing off in contests like Quickest Sunburn, Jumping Inability, Lack of Rhythm, Star Trek Fan-Fiction Writing, NASCAR Identification Quiz, and, of course, hockey.</p><p>
    Apparently I missed the season where Erlend Øye won the coveted golden-golf-ball belt of The Whitest Boy Alive, but apparently the musician is proud enough of his accomplishment to have named his latest project after the award.  It's no surprise that Øye was such a formidable candidate; after all, he hails from notorious WBA powerhouse country Norway, and despite being quite poor in the Lack of Rhythm competition, his Nordic skin resembles an Atomic Fireball with the most miniscule of sunlight exposure, and he looks like he'd be an encyclopedia of TNG-era Trek facts.</p><p>
    Øye's pride in his title might fool you into thinking the Whitest Boy Alive is, as the name would indicate, some kind of tee-hee ironic white-kid rap project; thankfully, it's not.  After making delicate whisper-folk as half of the Kings of Convenience, a collaborative electronic solo record, and rechristening himself ""The Singing DJ"" for a well-received <em>DJ-Kicks</em> set, Øye now takes the step of making electric music, ""rock,"" for lack of any better term.  Hewing close to the soft side of the genre, <em>Dreams</em> presents a sound that invokes every Scandinavian stereotype not yet broached by this review: socialism-clean, winter-wind crisp, expensive-sounding, and unfailingly polite.

    Like the similarly fussy Phoenix, Øye applies each element of his four-piece band with obsessive meticulousness, creating a tight, rhythmic sound that is so unfunky it comes back around to funky again.  Reflective of his DJ set's taste for Kompakt-style glossy house, TWBA's drumming is metronomic and efficient, while the bass, guitar, and keyboards gently entwine with drill-team precision, imagining if Kraftwerk had produced Fleetwood Mac.
    </p>
<p>
    Whether you find this winterfresh concoction to be electrifying or sedative depends on your temperament, or your thoughts on previous Øye work; all the new-fangled amplification doesn't do much to raise the singer's library-voice volume.  Øye attempts to mix things up by indulging a heretofore unknown taste for guitar solos, nothing too flashy, but still providing a bit of fang on an otherwise toothless record.  When the guitar spotlights are kept at a messy-chord rhythm-guitar level (as on ""Burning"", or the nicely inverted progression of ""Inflation""), they're satisfying, like intentionally making a mess of a neat freak's kitchen counter.  When the solos turn to extended vamps, as on ""Down with You"", they only magnify the music's hypnotic qualities, for better or worse (mostly worse).  Elsewhere, on ""Above You"", Øye tries to animate his stiff sound with playful keyboards: a crunchy clavinet that successfully adds some strut, and a bloopy synth that ruins the strut by making it sound like they're jamming with R2D2.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, despite the stylistic embellishments, Øye can't completely escape his now well-established persona; that same restrained voice, those same detached melodies, the same room left for silence, no matter whether it's set against folk, electronic, or rock trappings.  There's still life left in that formula, but transferring it from genre to genre must be getting exhausting-- Øye himself sounds a bit groggy by the drum-less closer ""All Ears"".  The taut, prim pop of <em>Dreams</em> does revitalize Øye's approach for a time, but by the end of the album the novelty is somewhat lost, a promising sound extinguished by the singer's refusal to expand his vocal horizons.  Blame it on a conflict of interest: The Whitest Boy Alive contest frowns upon excessive displays of vocal exuberance, and its champion and house band are obligated to comply.

    Last year, Chicago's Catfish Haven made a fine official debut with their <em>Please
    Come Back</em> EP. Pumping the energy of their punk rock youths into velvety
    white-boy soul and acoustic roots-rock, and with a raucous rhythm section chugging
    away beneath George Hunter's mellifluous howl, they managed to skirt snooty
    trad and revisionist indie pretensions alike by doing something obvious:
    charging passionately through emphatic melodies with strictly defined
    instrumentation. It's a simple formula they retain for their debut LP, <em>Tell
    Me</em>, which suffers from periods of drag that were absent from the tightly
    coiled <em>Please Come Back</em>.</p><p>
    There's another terrific EP on <em>Tell Me</em>, and you could put together a
    top-slot Catfish Haven record with both discs and a little iTunes pruning. The
    bright, perky strum of ""I Don't Worry"" is just the kind of
    haystack-rostrum from which Hunter is meant to proselytize, climaxing in what I'm
    afraid I have to characterize as a bona-fide hootenanny. The swamp-gospel
    shimmy of the title track is infectious, and the taut, cheerful funk of
    ""Crazy for Leaving"" is good slinky fun. The flayed soul of Hunter's
    vocals on ""All I Need is You"" resonates well with the song's spindly,
    sprightly lilt, while ""Let it Go (Got to Grow)"" profits from the same
    frantic yet controlled strumming found on last year's EP's stand-out title
    track.</p><p>
    Nevertheless, on <em>Tell Me</em>, Catfish Haven presents as a good band
    working in a format-- in this case, the long-player-- that just doesn't suit
    their music, at least not if it stays as circumscribed as it is now. It's built
    from such sparse materials-- hard-charging acoustic guitars, clattering
    rhythms, raspy soul vocals, and, as of this record, judicious keys and horns--
    and mines such a narrow strip of musical terrain that its interest has the
    potential to run out before the wax does. Hunter's lyrics don't assuage this
    intermittent sense of monotony. The same directness that works in the short
    format falters in the long one; the alternately broken-hearted and
    platitudinous catch phrases becoming less charming and more tiresome. Nor does
    it help that the album is rounded out by a handful of slow burners so thin they
    make a scanty impression. ""Down by Your Fire"" and ""Grey
    Skies"" meander like they've got nowhere to go, which, it seems, they
    don't. Hunter and co. have plenty of talent, but unless they significantly
    diversify their sound, they're going to be better known for the concise,
    exuberant rush than the sustained concept.

    Charlotte Gainsbourg, now an acclaimed French actress perhaps best known in the U.S. for 2003's <em>21 Grams</em>, made her musical debut as a <em>Lolita</em>-esque nymphet cavorting in bed with her notoriously lascivious father Serge Gainsbourg in 1984's ""Lemon Incest"".  In 1986, Gainsbourg <em>pere</em> penned his daughter's gloopy, synth-accented debut album, <em>Charlotte For Ever</em>, which accompanied a film of the same title.</p><p>
    Now, two decades later, Charlotte returns with her sophomore full-length. It's not the younger Gainsbourg's first time back in the recording studio; her new effort follows film soundtrack contributions in 1996 and 2005, a 2004 duet with French pop singer Étienne Daho, a 2002 guestspot with Badly Drawn Boy, and even a 2001 spoken-word appearance for Madonna (herself a Gainsbourgian provocateur, albeit with a cruder conception of the erotic). Still, on <em>5:55</em>, Gainsbourg again coos breathlessly in her father's well-worn sophisticate boudoir, adding little to the family musical legacy despite a star-studded supporting cast.</p><p>
    The album's central appeal lies in Gainsbourg's whispery, London-accented vocals. Like her mother, English actress and singer Jane Birkin, Gainsbourg has a limited tonal range that belies her beguiling interpretive powers-- and statuesque <em>je ne sais quois</em>. She can sing of love as surgery on sweaty lavalamp groove ""The Operation"" without sounding <em>totally</em> creepy, and moan about being ""drunk here on the edge of space"" on ""Af607105"" without recalling William Shatner doing ""Rocket Man"". Her biggest miscue is cool-jazz throwaway ""Nocturnal Intermission"", which stoops to its title with such murmured dialogue as, ""What is your favorite cuss?"" and ""Which side of the bed do you sleep on?"" Gainsbourg has said she did the album in English to avoid coming ""too close to my Dad,"" but her vocals nevertheless inevitably compare unfavorably to her mother's on classics like ""Je T'aime...Moi Non Plus"" or ""Ballade de Melody Nelson"".
    </p>
<p>
    So, too, Gainsbourg's contributors buckle beneath excessive reverence for the paterfamilias. Nigel Godrich's production dips more deeply into lounge nostalgia than during his work for Air, who proffer their own Serge-besotted talents. Lyricists Jarvis Cocker of Pulp and Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy add their highbrow storytelling and wordplay-- peaking with quips like, ""Never fall in love with a body double,"" or ""If I pull this off I'll refuse the Nobel prize""-- though most songs, including drippy acoustic ballad ""Beauty Mark"" and string-drenched first single ""The Songs That We Sing"", are atypically generic. A stylish but stilted pastiche, <em>5:55</em> follows a decade's worth of mostly superior homages, often involving the same artists. And this is the only immortality the album will share with the year's other Gainsbourg tribute, <em>Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited</em>.

    overthink. The witty lyrics toss biomatter into the same heap of vague
    ""things"" as technomatter; thus you get songs called
    ""Photocopier"" and ""Cassettesingle"" snugly beside songs
    called ""Collarbone"" and ""Ankle Injuries"". Obsessing
    about F&amp;M's obsession with thingness forces one to conclude that this
    album is a mysterious relic from an alternate 1971.</p><p>
    Think about it: In 1971, British writer Alan Watts released <em>Does It Matter?:
    Essays on Man's Relation to Materiality</em>, in which he argued (among other
    ""things"") that humans aren't really true materialists, with our
    reverence for materials, resources and craft. Rather, he typed, we're
    abstractists, caught in our preference for stockpiling plastic gewgaws. <em>Transparent Things</em> playfully spoofs and luxuriates in
    how we're possessed by our possessions. One song's speaker wants to ""kick
    it"" with a girl, but first he's ""got to get a new pair of
    shoes."" Another's chorus taunts, ""I'm just monkeying around with your
    furniture,"" after the verse cites spilled ""bodily fluids"" and
    how the subject ""must be off [his/her] bleeding rocker."" In context,
    ""bleeding"" suggests actual blood rather than the UK default pejorative.
    With comic detachment, the lyrics' casual violence contrasts with the music's
    antiseptic cleanness enough to make one recall the sterile/obscene,
    bodylike/inorganic sculptures from the milkbar and the murder victim's house in
    Kubrick's <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> (ahem, 1971).</p><p>
    Anyway: Alan Watts went on to become a Nipponophile, leading temple tours in
    Japan and even getting accused of faking his enlightenment; Fujiya &amp; Miyagi
    readily admit their impostorship in a chorus on this album, as if the whole
    thing was a meticulous piss-take: ""We were just pretending to be
    Japanese."" True: Fujiya's a turntable company, and
    Miyagi's the filmic Okinawan played by Pat Morita who instructs sullen white
    kids in martial arts. Fujiya &amp; Miyagi presumably relish urban Japan's
    cultural gizmosis, the fixation with gadgetry and the attention to detail paid
    even on the level of toy eraser design. F&amp;M's carefully constructed
    retro-futuristic electronica definitely suggests the quaint, boxy dawn of
    portable media. And what year did Sony begin selling televisions in Britain,
    prompting the Time Magazine cover story ""Japan, Inc""? That would be
    1971.
    </p><p>
    The ""coincidence"" continues: Can and Neu! are the acts whose
    production and syncopation F&amp;M most acefully cop; both
    acts were either recording or releasing their crucial work in 71. ""In One
    Ear and Out the Other"" bounces with Eno-era Roxy Music's eerie
    psychedelic-lounge sound; yup, they formed and recorded their debut in 71.
    ""Sucking Punch"" apes the falsetto vox, pimpy guitar, and whomping,
    slinky bass of both Curtis Mayfield's 1971-recorded <em>Superfly</em> and Serge Gainsbourg's 1971 LP <em>Historie de Melody Nelson</em>. And the name of the
    lengthy instrumental that best synthesizes (the 1971-recorded) <em>Kraftwerk 2</em> with
    the best of the rest of krautrock's stoner-jazz and metronome-prog? ""Conductor
    71"".
    </p>
<p>
    To be fair, Can and Neu! aren't the only three-letter outfits that F&amp;M
    echo: This band has processed bits of
    contemporaries such as Air, DFA/LCD, and BoC. At points, the funk and the
    unrhyming lyrics even mount to imply various UK greats: A muted Happy Mondays
    here, a stream-of-consciousness Streets there. And yet, F&amp;M's coy pose
    comes off as somehow original. David Best doesn't speak-sing about commodities
    with the abandon of say, Sisqo harmonizing ""thong-th-thong-thong-thong,""
    but he also sidesteps the posthuman staidness with which Ladytron tried to
    address blue jeans and cracked plastic (during ""Blue Jeans"" and
    ""Cracked Plastic"", respectively) back on <em>Light &amp; Magic</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    A kind of consumer-Zen can be heard in the way Best sings the fabulously
    confident title track's refrain, ""I look through transparent things and I
    feel okay,"" pronouncing the last word, ""O-kehh."" Is he talking about seeing
    through eyeglasses? Drink glasses? Or, by noting the behavioral norms (of
    litterbugs, cyclists, and college students) and their ""grids,""
    ""zones,"" and ""boxes,"" is Best referring to the matrixy
    systems in which most of us are transparently ensnared? Either way, F&amp;M's
    execution of old modes is authoritative enough to ward off soundalike syndrome,
    just as Interpol somehow dodge their ancestors' arrows. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album's weaker spots are its louder numbers about actual monogamous
    desire, which seem banal next to the whispered, anchorless prosaic observations
    of the songs that would only count as ""rave-ups"" at some secret
    librarian party held on a monastery's roof. A group so adept at merely creating
    an irresistible pulse seems overextended when trying to concoct a banger. I
    mean, come on, they begin this album with shy in-house brand enthusiasm, chanting
    ""Fujiya"" and ""Miyagi"" in barely audible voices!
    </p>
<p>
    The relatively effete and Euro-centric American poet Wallace Stevens is
    famously supposed to have said to the relatively dudeish and homelandy American
    poet Robert Frost, upon meeting: ""The trouble with you is you write about
    things."" To which Frost replied: ""The trouble with you is you write
    about bric-a-brac."" Via fiery slightness, Fujiya &amp; Miyagi humbly
    request that you dance to both.

I listened to <em>The Air Force</em>
    a dozen or so times without thinking much of it. In fact, Xiu Xiu's
    fifth album didn't click for me until late one night after the wrecking
    crew across the street had long stopped loading broken buildings into a
    dumpster. So at 3 a.m., Jamie Stewart's video
    game symphony, his battered love letter, was finally backed by the
    proper blend of party people buzzing inaudibly, occasional horns, and my
    over-caffeinated twitching.</p><p>
    Considering Xiu Xiu's output, it's understandable you might overlook any number of releases: the covers EP, <em>Tu Mi Piaci</em>, is still fresh from the oven; the Grouper collaboration, <em>Creepshow</em>,
    is just around the corner; album six, with its much talked about
    Michael Gira duet, is bubbling on the horizon. Take a few breaths,
    though, and give these songs time to lodge themselves in your brain. The album
    floats perfectly from ""Buzz Saw""'s opening piano (played by Deerhoof
    drummer Greg Saunier, who produced the record) through the
    quiet ""walla walla walla walla walla walla hey"" hook that tags the end
    of track six, ""Bishop, CA"". After that, koto
    instrumental ""Saint Pedro Glue Stick"" draws a line in the dirt,
    introducing the next act: torture, blood, suicide.</p><p>
    Largely focusing on love and death and what each means to individuals, the lyrics break from <em>La Foret</em>'s
    angrier, war-torn metaphors to sharpened details of small yet
    catastrophic heartaches. On tie-me-up-and-runaway love song ""Buzz
    Saw"", Stewart's thoughts are as fragile and bare as nervous high-school
    nothings: ""Your black hair is like black hair/ Mine I promise is a
    jerk's hair/ Your acne is like a pearl/ Mine I swear is brimstone.""
    Goose bumps? Imperfection as gorgeousness: A chipped tooth, a scar, a
    leather belt around a wrist. The song unrolls like a hymn from
    beneath a bed, ending with a three-part, pitch-lapping harmony and
    bells-- exclamations that leave bruises.
    </p><p>
    Stewart said he penned the harrowing anthem ""Boy Soprano"" for a trio of
    younger men, between 18 and 22, who he knows on some level. It's a
    confusing mix of fascination, attraction, fear: ""Look at me, nothing
    bad is ever/ Going to happen to you again/ Although you are a solid
    pile of hate/ You're still pretty like a cake."" He's paternal, but
    isn't a father figure: The cake-pretty toughs don't trust him because
    he drinks ""poncey"" things like vodka and is well beyond the age that
    people would suspect him of lighting fires, as ascending notes and
    noise formations echo his increasing (sexual? emotional?) frustration.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Hello From Eau Claire"", Caralee McElroy first full-on
    Xiu Xiu front-woman gig, offers a bit of distance from Stewart's typical work. Xiu Xiu are great at gender-bending (see, for instance, ""Sad Pony
    Guerrilla Girl""), so it's easy to think she's singing as a boy
    dreaming ""that you might think of me as a man."" When she lists her
    can-do's (""loose my own tie knot,"" ""pay my own debts,"" ""buy my own
    cigarettes,"" ""pluck my own mustache,"" ""rip off my own tights""), it's
    just as difficult to say: Girls wear ties; boys were tights; everyone
    has body hair, debts, and a desire for smokes. Regardless of how strong
    he/she thinks he/she might be, the strength crumbles in the final
    couplet: ""I can humiliate myself to your face/ I can weep through my
    own midnights."" Perhaps it's McElroy's vocals-- less dramatic than Stewart's-- but the
    song is the poppiest Xiu Xiu in memory. It's reminiscent of the Magnetic Fields before Stephin Merritt sang-- both because of the female vocal pattern, but also that tinny
    ""100,000 Fireflies""-like synth. 
    </p>
<p>
    And the love just keeps a-comin! ""Vulture Piano"" is among
    Stewart's catchiest hooks: He spells out the song
    title in full pitch-shift elf voice, before going into one of his
    ""whoop, whoop"" ""I Luv the Valley, OH!"" shouts. ""PJ in the Streets..."" is a
    tableau that references the Smiths' ""Panic"" and its ""But Honey Pie,
    you're not safe here"" sentiment. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Saint Pedro Glue Stick"" is that aforementioned,
    act-changing line in the sand. Sonically, it's a racket of Japanese
    koto (think: zither) and birds or human whistles. It's both boxy and spare; someone locked in a closet aviary. After it, violence becomes even more personal and
    intimate: Hands-on cutting and slicing. ""The Pineapple vs. the
    Watermelon"", a paeon to a father's suicide, is stripped down, thematically
    connected to the sounds before it: ""The bird I am looking for is
    not in me/ It is you."" A shift in vocal effects
    makes it sound as if Stewart's taking flight. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>The Air Force</em>
    closes with the one-man dialogue, ""Wig Master"". The
    instrumentation's simple: double bass, samples, and Stewart's
    pitch-shifting vocals. (The bass tone's amazing: a tea kettle half
    frozen.) Sounding childlike, Stewart speaks of a cactus bed
    and burning a lover's hair to stay warm, before switching back to his
    street voice to promise: ""I'm gonna spank your ass so hard you will
    hate/ The wig master."" ""Wig Master""'s definition of loneliness:
    ""Loneliness isn't being alone, it's when someone loves you/ And you
    don't have it in you to love them back."" Finding fault in yourself for
    an inability to take advantage of a potential connection. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's
    been a good year for the tortured. A couple of days ago I was
    scribbling my favorite 2006 albums on a napkin-- records by Scott Walker,
    Nachtmystium, Xasthur, the Knife, Junior Boys, and Tim Hecker, among
    others, creating a smeary Ian Curtis wish list. It made me wonder how
    Jamie Stewart feels about the turn toward a less smiley vibe. For a
    long time, it was <em>de rigeur</em> to label him the darkest, most
    fucked up guy in indie rock-- the dude that read Dennis Cooper and
    Mishima while listening to Morrissey and half-watching a documentary on hari-kari. That's romanticizing things, but Stewart's one of the more intriguingly dark, honest artists I've
    encountered across over the past few years. So hey, it's
    interesting then to note that just when the indie kids are switching
    their wardrobes to black, Xiu Xiu should unleash-- relatively speaking, of course-- their most
    understated, surprisingly sweetest album to date.

    I'm capable as anybody of early work-sentimentality, privileging the verve of the first album over the polished craft of the eighth, but not with Richard Buckner. Some artists build upon their sensibility over time, while some refine it in search of its essence. Buckner is the latter, and it's startling to revisit his 1994 debut, <em>Bloomed</em>, and be reminded how much he's changed. The raw twang and declarative simplicity of Buckner's debut marked it as a clear emanation of the folk tradition. While it had flashes of the singularity that would gradually emerge in his work, it lacked modern Buckner's melodic focus and lyrical depth, with a folksy emphasis on immediacy over poise.</p><p>
    But Richard Buckner doesn't play folk music anymore. After <em>Bloomed</em>, he set about dismantling the idiom, closing in on something gnomic and self-contained, with no clear connection to any tradition outside of its own. <em>Meadow </em>picks up where his 2004 Merge bow <em>Dents and Shells</em> left off-- amid icy pianos and warm swirls of electric guitar. The songs are melodically portentous (whipped into fine froths by GBV alums Doug Gillard and Kevin March); sung in a gruff yet honeyed voice so enveloping that it feels more like a place you go than a sound you hear. The lyrics are dense with subjectivity, attaching one hallucinatory image to another by obscure but inflexible dream logic. Buckner proffers up little bouquets of ambiguous pronouns and verbs that, petal by petal, are almost without content. It's in the total garland, the relationships between the colors and shapes, that meaning emerges.</p><p>
    The elliptical on-the-lam song ""Town"", where Buckner's voice skids over crashing waves of guitar, is a perfect example of the tense instrumental/vocal interface and compelling inscrutability that mark his modern style. There's an elusive ""it"" that scuttles off every time you think you've drawn a bead on it; there's a one-sided dialogue with an unknown interlocutor; there're clusters of self-negating language circling the unspeakable; and most of all, there's a sense of glittering stasis and temporal inflation, as if this one infinitesimal instant has become a recursive loop Buckner's trying to sing his way out of: ""Last night the rain just wouldn't fall,"" he sings, pregnant drops trembling in midair. 
    </p>
<p>
    The gritty drive of ""Window"" is as anxious as its lyrical noir, something namelessly sinister seething in lines like ""Darling, you won't forget/ Standing out of frame"" and ""Aren't you cold/ Standing by my window/ Curtained up and closed?"": Frames within frames, regressing infinitely. If it all sounds intangible, that's because it is, and all the better for it -- where Buckner used to tell, now he shows. He doesn't do metaphors, working instead with the raw stuff of perception to illuminate the contours of a particular shape in the dark, the back-story flowing in spectrally behind vivid innuendo, all in an attempt to thwart his cultivated inertia and, as he sings amid the gently panning snares and pulsing guitars of ""Kingdom"", ""Clear the door/ To another room.""

    this reunion album couldn't drop at a more apropos time. Combining the
    sounds of Jesus Lizard, Girls Against Boys, and pretty much every Steve
    Albini-led band, Uzeda are essentially a T&amp;G cover band with Kim Deal on vocals. And despite being the band's first album in
    eight years, <em>Stella</em> finds these Sicilians pummeling in
    mid-season form, hitting every mark in their noise rock assault.</p><p>
    Of course, it doesn't hurt that Albini's parked himself behind the boards, channeling
    reams of shit-stomping rage with the twist of each knob. The team-up again works wonders as Albini injects a bristled edge into
    Uzeda's sound, which doesn't naturally exude an immediate pissed-off
    aura. Opener ""Wailing"" drags its clanking feet so laboriously and
    loosely it could almost qualify as shoegaze-Shellac. Giovanni Nicosia
    and Agostino Tilotta's jagged guitars casually stab at a plodding
    bassline, while frontwoman Giovanna Cacciola provides unintelligible
    sing-song coos, a nursery rhyme told over a brewing storm. ""What I
    Meant When I Called Your Name"" tightens up this formula, swirling
    around a rough'n'tumble noise-blues riff and culminating in a
    femme-David Yow rant from Cacciola over screeching guitars.
    Occasionally though the band takes a chill pill, particularly when
    Cacciola's raspy vox combines with playful, more hook-based ax noodling
    to form faux-Breeders track ""Time Below Zero"".</p><p>
    Unfortunately, such changeups come too seldom on <em>Stella</em>, and too many tracks here sound stuck in second gear. At times, <em>Stella</em>
    blurs the line between consistency and homogeneity, which is probably
    nitpicking except that eight tracks in less than half an hour leaves
    little to explore. Still, closer ""Steam, Rain and Other Stuff"" wraps up
    the record nicely, with a herky-jerky drum beat and Cacciola's howls
    summarizing the entire album in a three-minute curtain call. While an
    album able to be condensed into such little space reflects poorly on
    the band's dynamism, <em>Stella</em> would still make a nice addition to any noise rock fanatic's collection.</p></div>"|9381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9381-stella/|7.2|Adam Moerder

The metal outcasts of the Providence scene, some of these guys were formerly behind the grind'n'grab As the Sun Sets, a band I once saw hit a girl in the face with a guitar.  And having gone the 10 songs in 11 minutes route on 2003's <em>Canada Songs</em>, they've found a new way to alienate their audience: a brand new, Beefheart-by-way-of-Mike Anderson gurgle, a gaspy moan of dissatisfaction in place of shredding vocals.</p><p>
    Daughters still play techy grindcore, but they're clearly listening to better records now: Birthday Party, who they covered recently; late-period Orchid; Racebannon and Rapider Than Horsepower. From the sound of things, they've even rediscovered the old Nation of Ulysses and Make Up records stashed between their couch cushions.  And though the assumption that they're actually going to offend somebody is as infuriating as that kind of thing always is-- ""Boner X-Ray"", ""The Fuck Whisperer"", har har-- their new gothic grind is, insofar as they've finally copped a great rhythm section to hold up their guitars, undeniably a good idea.</p><p>
    Bands like the Locust or Discordance Axis made a mid-1990s routine of throwing dozens of different riffs into one-minute-or-less songs; Daughters, to their credit, have realized that making actual songs involves returning to the stuff that works, if only for a few bars.  ""Providence by Gaslight"", for instance, alternates high-pitched, vibrating chords with double-bass and blast-beats, back and forth as both parts build, then slams ‘em together on the trumpet (played by Kayo Dot's Forbes Graham) punctured finale.
    </p><p>
    Like lots of the post-punk and art-rock they're raiding to make their robotic metal, Daughters have freed their guitars to explore and go fucking nuts by designating the melodic leads to their bass and bass drum. ""Daughters Spelled Wrong"" is a queasy, angled-lightning riff with what sounds like Marshall trying to speak even as he throws up; ""Fiery"" is almost pure drum solo, even as it has a kind of narrative arc; ""Cheers, Pricks""-- at six minutes, presumably the longest song Daughters have ever written-- coasts off a lazily bright bass riff that descends even as the track collapses on itself.
    </p>
<p>
    Daughters' uneasy marriage of Pussy Galore-cum-Locust attitude mirrors what they're attempting on <em>Hell Songs</em>: A unity of two different avant-gardes united mostly by a desire for shock and aural awe.  The resulting songs might even work too well-- together, the disparate elements of grind and trashcan-rock come together so naturally that the result is almost conventional, which one has to think isn't really their intent.  Forgive them for trying to freak us out: In the process, they've stumbled on to something.

    How Justin Timberlake must have sweated and strained over following his debut, <em>Justified</em>: As an album it was merely good, but it was graced by four singles so monumental they made him one of the decade's most celebrated pop icons. According to the laws of momentum which govern pop music, any sequel could only be either be a pale reflection or a hubristic monstrosity. With <em>FutureSex/LoveSounds</em> he unrepentantly chooses the latter.</p><p>
    If <em>Justified</em> was openly modelled on <em>Off the Wall</em>, <em>FutureSex/LoveSounds</em>' affectations are more panoramic: In reductive terms, it's the logical <em>Thriller</em>-style follow-up, steelier and sexier and more neurotic than its predecessor, but generally the album is more reminiscent of Prince-- not only the polished funk-pop of <em>Purple Rain</em>, but also the grandiose excess of Prince's last 20 years. Nothing is necessarily gained (and often much is lost) when pop music attires itself in notions of artistry and ambition, but with Justin it is, perversely, what makes him such a good pop star: As with Christina Aguilera, towering self-belief and stylistic metamorphoses provide a spectacle which papers over his stumbles and adds lustre to his successes.</p><p>
    Almost entirely produced by Timbaland-- and with a more pronounced
    hip-hop edge than its predecessor-- the album abandons the feelgood
    sheen which the Neptunes peddled so adroitly on <em>Justified</em>, but
    makes up for it with the largesse of its sonic embrace, with Timbaland
    resurrecting many of his most effective guises, from rubbery synthetic
    funk to pseudo-crunk blare to eerie Eastern opulence. Throughout, the
    grooves are defined by their melodic intensity: It's the searing synth
    riffs and skyscraping strings which grab your attention, not stuttering
    beats or startling sound effects-- although these, too, are present in
    abundance. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Here, Timberlake magnifies the persona he adopted on his debut,
    somehow both consummate lover and desperately needy. On hyperactive
    second single ""My Love"" his sexual propositions constantly elide into a
    proposal, as if anything less than matrimony is barely worth
    contemplating. Likewise, the suavely portentous title track-- poised between the carnal strut of Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"" (well, its verses) and the masochistic flutter of the Junior Boys-- derives its charm from its lofty aspirations, like a familiar lover staging an elaborately exaggerated seduction. It is this excess of ambition over achievement, as opposed to any real consistency, which makes <em>FutureSex/LoveSounds</em> more of an album than <em>Justified</em> was. Songs which sound puzzlingly self-indulgent in isolation-- most obviously, the smirking, tenuously tuneful first single ""SexyBack""-- are cloaked in a compelling intensity and purposefulness when played in succession. 
    </p>
<p>
    Most brilliantly, the tight, clipped disco-funk of ""LoveStoned"" descends precipitously into the gorgeous melancholy of ""I Think That She Knows"", all MOR-rock guitar churn and weightless strings, the same chorus (""She's got me love stoned…and I think that she knows"") transformed from infatuation to the paranoid and elegiac admission of an addict. This unselfconscious (or, rather, hyper-selfconscious) revelling in melodramatic gestures is among the album's attractions; even the handful of glutinous ballads are admirable for their lack of restraint or proportion-- in particular, the gospel-tinged morality tale ""Losing My Way"", graced by utterly cringeworthy lyrics, is somehow both a colossal disaster and deeply lovable. Such missteps are few, but also a necessary piece of this album's puzzle: By courting disaster so fearlessly, Timberlake's reach makes his music attractive-- even when it exceeds his grasp.

    Though <em>Fading Trails</em> is more minor-key, and less allusive, than past Magnolia Electric Co. efforts-- there are fewer baseball references and cruel women-- it would a mistake to write this record off as the product of diminishing returns.  The ghost-moons and wolf-Christs with which Jason Molina pays homage to the blues, again and again, are not lyrical crutches, but attempts to build through repetition.  He's a romantic, conjuring up handfuls of dust and crescent moons, empty baseball diamonds, and lost horizons in the service of a vision of a world that doesn't quite exist, though we might all feel, at one time or another, as though we've glimpsed it.</p><p>
    On the first Magnolia Electric Co. album, Molina had his own heart split in two, and his response was the only one we could expect: ""Half I'm going to use/ To pay this band/ Half I'm saving because I'm going to owe them.""  His stoic devotion to his own craft even over his own heart is, like it was and still is for Bob Dylan, both myth and more or less the truth.  The only thing that matters to him, even above his own songs, is the freedom to play them, which is why Molina's project is intelligible only as an ongoing one.  In recording sessions, he regularly tosses out whole records and writes new ones on the spot.  His live sets are populated with songs he wrote as recently as that day. Those like myself who miss Songs: Ohia, because they prefer directness over guitar solos and vulnerability over big chords, can comfort themselves with the fact that in the continuum of Molina's music, everything is equally yesterday's news and, at the same time, the beginning of yet another song.</p><p>
    On <em>Fading Trails,</em> Molina leans on the blues because there's nothing else to lean on.  ""Maybe if I send back the blues/ Her broken heart/ She'll send back my mine,"" he wonders on ""A Little at a Time"", then asks, ""You can't lose it all at once, can you really?""  The blues hold his heart and his life ransom.  ""A Little"", like opener ""Don't Fade on Me"", is minimal and twangy in the manner of Songs:Ohia's <em>Didn't It Rain</em>, on which cymbals kept time like rain and acoustic guitars were footsteps on dark, unlit and gravelly roads.  And the electric flourishes of Magnolia Electric here feel more like weather than the oft-cited Neil Young or Warren Zevon, all ominous snarls and quick flashes of slide guitar.  ""Don't fade on me,"" he begs, but everyone besides his band always does.
    </p>
<p>
    So what's left?  ""Harmony onward, friend"" is <em>Fading Trails</em>' one boast, nestled among ""Lonesome Valley""'s organ plunks and slide flourishes.  He's chosen solos and a backing band over touring and recording by himself, because being able to play every night, rain or shine, is the only redemption he believes in, and the more people, the more music.
    </p>
<p>
    But just because Molina's in man-at-the-brink, guitar-in-hand mode doesn't mean <em>Fading Trails</em> is a recast of <em>What Comes After the Blues</em> and the <em>Hard to Love a Man </em>EP.  Nor does it account for the Songs:Ohia records, which in my book are consistently better front to back-- less because I liked the old arrangements more (which I did), but because he soft-pedaled and sold his lesser songs better.  I'd say <em>Fading Trails</em> is the best Magnolia's done, unless you count the nominally Songs:Ohia-made <em>Magnolia Electric Co.</em>, which I do, and which is still the best Molina product out.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, <em>Fading Trails</em> better synthesizes the old solo Molina with the post-Newport 65, as it were, Molina.  There are more gems in gem form (some otherwise great Magnolia songs have turned out merely good, due to the way-long guitar breaks between practically every line)-- say, ""Don't Fade on Me"", ""A Little at a Time"", and ""Steady Now""-- and less full-on, Zevon guitar bleat on the ostensible burners.
    </p>
<p>
    Best is how fully realized Molina's always meta-blues have become, how his whole mythology is finally looking in the mirror and acknowledging mutual dependence, if not real love.  Molina, increasingly, is singing not at himself, the hard-to-love-man, but at the very Midwestern blues he's always been trying to create. ""Nothing lives for nothing,"" sings Molina, and he is figuring out song-by-song what's opposite those voids

    There was a time-- they call it ""the 1960s,"" I'm told-- when it was
    common in certain circles to propose love as a solution to all of the world's
    problems. This is temptingly elegant. Just love each other, man. Boom! No more
    problems. Well, this is not the 60s. This is the 00s, or the naughts, or the
    oughts, or...we still haven't figured out what to call this decade, but
    it's much later, at any rate. We have seen that love will not solve the world's
    problems, and we are cynical. There is terror out there somewhere, we're told,
    and it is coming to get us.</p><p>
    I sense that dancing away this terror will be about as effective as loving
    away war, but I like the idea of trying. I doubt that the members of the
    Capitol Years seriously intend the title of their third album (second as a full
    band) as true post-hippie sentiment-- more than likely, it's another in a long
    line of vaguely sarcastic references to orange alert level fatigue. If nothing
    else, the Capitol Years have spent the last few years getting progressively
    more danceworthy, rocking things up a bit and getting loose.</p><p>
<em>Dance Away the Terror</em> takes that well-earned looseness and turns the
    harmony hose on it, bringing the rawk of the Capitol Years' previous album <em>Let Them Drink</em> and the <em>Jewelry
    Store</em> EP into the candy shop of pop. Leader Shai Halperin has kept the
    punch in the band's arrangements while softening his vocal melodies-- in scope,
    this is closest to his first album, when he alone was the Capitol Years, but
    it's much more memorable than that record. For instance, when <em>Dance Away</em>
    dips closest to the insular folk he was trafficking in back then, on
    ""Seven Songs"", the directness of the melody and the sharpness of the
    three-part harmony send it right home as ambient flurries of electric piano
    fall around it. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Revolutions"" has a floating feel provided by a jaunty rhythm and
    pentatonic bass line, and the vocals fall in so naturally it feels like they
    were dropped there. The smoothness of the verses is offset by descending guitar
    runs and a series of double-stop interludes where the band piles on the spacey
    guitar and chiming keys. ""You Can Stay There"" is drenched in velvety
    vocal interplay, and the album closes with a solid one-two power pop punch.
    ""Oh Lord"" features Halperin's most impassioned lead vocal, paired
    with a catchy melody, while ""It's Not Okay"" teases after the opening
    verse with a chasmic pause, before redoubling and heading off for a huge chorus
    that takes hippie sentiment head-on with the line ""It's not okay to
    believe in love."" 
    </p>
<p>
    The album isn't perfect-- the title track and its companion ""As the
    Terror Dances Your Way"" don't do much other than provide a point of
    reprise-- but it's the band's best full-length yet, and shows their approach
    maturing and becoming more nuanced. For a rock album, it actually has a rather
    calming effect, and it certainly wouldn't make much of a soundtrack for the
    forget-the-world celebration of its title, but it stays with you either way as
    a satisfying album.

    Hella's aptly titled <em>Acoustics </em>EP consists of six acoustic renditions of previously released songs, recorded by a version of the group that doesn't really exist anymore. In other words, this release might seem to be the virtual definition of a stopgap product. Yet <em>Acoustics</em> appears at such a crucial juncture in Hella's history that it could achieve a heightened importance for the group's devoted following. The spazz-phonic outfit has recently expanded from the traditional duo of guitarist Spencer Seim and drummer Zach Hill into a full-fledged quintet, so in a large sense these six tracks represent the final frantic blurt of Hella's original stripped-down twosome. If so, Hella have certainly marked the occasion with an appropriate degree of bluster. Though shorn of their electricity, these six instrumentals retain every ounce of Hella's distinctive and bewildering sputter-- pounding the listener with a sonic impact akin to getting trampled by jacked-up centipedes.</p><p>
    Any appreciation for Hella's music must first begin with a healthy admiration for the duo's monstrous chops and intuitive sense for taking high-velocity hairpin turns in perfect tandem. Though the pair have incorporated various tangled electronics and 8-bit digital effects into recent works like 2005's epic double-album <em>Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard</em>, at heart their live act has always been based on their hyperactive and unwieldy guitar/drum duets. All of the tracks on <em>Acoustics </em>are drawn from either 2002's <em>Hold Your Horse Is</em> or 2004's <em>The Devil Isn't Red</em>, concentrating on established favorites like ""Cafeteria Bananas"" and ""Biblical Violence"". And on these acoustic versions, Hella recreate the original studio recordings with a precision that seems rather astonishing-- snarled riffs that at first glance might be misinterpreted as random noodling are here revealed to be compositions of manic, near-obsessive organization.</p><p>
    On their studio albums, Hella's music has always been a spontaneous collision of distinct styles and techniques, the results a mystifying concoction of avant-noise, speed metal, jazz fusion, and Nintendo trauma. The same is also true of <em>Acoustics</em>, but here the men of Hella make use of a slightly different skill set. On the opening ""1-800-Ghost Dance"", Seim plays with an almost flamenco-like delicacy, the sound of each isolated note held momentarily in crystal suspension. From there the two immediately blast into ""Women of the 90's"" in what appears to be one uninterrupted take. Here, as elsewhere on these six tracks, Hill seems to be taking a little something off his fastball, lightening his volume but not his workload as he issues a relentless fusillade of crashing cymbals and floor-toms. In fact, the nearest precedent for his work here can sometimes seem to be the tribal rhythms of the late-80s Butthole Surfers, a resemblance that is most remarkable since the Surfers actually employed two drummers at the time. 
    </p>
<p>
    The problems that naturally arise on albums like <em>Acoustics</em> are-- of course-- primarily due to simple familiarity. Anyone who owns Hella's previous albums should have a pretty solid idea of what to expect here, as the duo have made few noticeable changes to their songs beyond the switch to acoustic. Most of these performances even have virtually identical track lengths with the originals, so it is not as though Seim and Hill have used the album as an opportunity for extensive improvisation or experimentation. Rather, the album seems to have been designed as one last farewell to the first chapter of Hella's lifespan, and one final document of their righteous commotion as a duo. And since these two guys have never been inclined to leave much empty space available in their music, <em>Acoustics</em> also serves to build curiosity to see exactly how they plan to fit three more musicians into their chaotic din.

Then again, this is someone who sold millions of people on a synth-laden rap-rock tune back when rap was still in its unlaced Adidas.  But that was eons ago, and while the thought of Patton going mersh in a tongue-in-cheek manner sounds appealing, <em>Peeping Tom</em> doesn't deliver.  Ideally, this record would be a repository where Patton's musical ADD could be marshaled, recombined, and disseminated in succinct four and five minute chunks.  Unfortunately, <em>Peeping Tom</em>, a project that's been six years in the making, is less a display of Patton's remarkable range and eclecticism and more a display of Patton's remarkable lack of aesthetic restraint.  In short: the guy, bless his heart, is just trying too hard.</p><p>
    Kicking off the album with a quartet of turgid tunes does this record no favors.  A gong crash introduces ""Five Seconds"", which tries to pull off the well-worn soft/loud rock trick.  However, it can't find solid footing to bridge Patton's crooned verses and his shrill, sped-up chorus.  Rahzel's amazing lip service is the highlight of the record's first single, ""Mojo"".  The song's purposefully dumb lyrics and smoking and drinking and Britney Spears, in tandem with its bow-legged gait, are not.  ""Don't Even Trip"" finds an interesting groove that approximates locking Rufus' ""Tell Me Something Good"" in a haunted house-- credit Amon Tobin for that odd pairing-- but Patton kicks his own ass when he starts singing about assholes growing on trees and pulling out the pruning shears.  As for ""Getaway"", Patton's collaboration with Kool Keith, it's seemingly a contest to see which of the two can sound the least interested-- Keith's mundane scatology beats out Patton's stiff singing by a nose.</p><p>
    Only when ""Your Neighborhood Spaceman"" starts up does this album seem to finally do something.  While Patton's indulging an extended space/isolation metaphor, the tune swells and swoons atop swirling synth strings and some well-placed wah-wah guitar.  Of course, there's a hip-hop break squeezed in that tries to trip up the momentum, but the tune still works all the same.  A similar roadblock nearly stymies the Bebel Gilberto collaboration, when the smooth bossanova groove trades in the brushes for drumsticks.  This bait-and-switch tactic works much better with a track like ""Celebrity Death Match,"" where Kid Koala matches Patton's vocal elasticity with equally elastic backing music - one minute, the song's propelled by a fuzzed-out bass and hippo-sized drums; the next, it's Patton's whistling that drives the tune.
    </p><p>
    For the most part, <em>Peeping Tom</em> succeeds when it keeps things simple.  Massive Attack's work on ""Kill the DJ"" isn't anything spectacular, but its a perfect accompaniment for Patton's rock-star turn.  ""Sucker"" (aka The Song Where Norah Jones Says a Bad Word) is the album's shortest and slinkiest track, and Jones' saucy cameo at the mic is equally short and sweet.  And, of course, the album's best track, a remix of the Dub Trio/Patton collaboration ""We're Not Alone"" (previously found on the Dub Trio's <em>New Heavy</em>), is also the album's biggest pop move.  With a little luck and a little payola (and a tolerance for the pinched wheeze Patton uses in the verse), that tune could find itself on heavy rotation at rocks stations all across America.  Part of me wishes the rest of the album was this eager to please.  For all the great ideas and fantastic moments sprinkled throughout <em>Peeping Tom</em>, it turns out that Mike Patton's idea of pop is as uncompromising as his other musical notions.

    Oh, what a heavy burden the Rapture must bear.  When ""House of Jealous Lovers"" dropped out of the sky like a bomb filled with hi-hat and cowbell, it set in motion dual music-crit ripples: The rise of the internet's ultimate game-of-telephone hype, and the promise of a chiropractic procedure on the stiff spine of indie rock.  The resulting frenzy over dancepunk or discopunk or indie-dance or many other compound words powered the band into a contract with Universal and buoyed the release of 2003's <em>Echoes</em>, still the definitive statement of 21st century indie rock rediscovering dance music.</p><p>
    Then, almost immediately, things began to fall apart.  The internet, fickle mistress that it is, began dissipating the aura around the Rapture as quickly as it had conjured it up, with listeners speculating that they were mere puppets for the DFA, or plagiarists of the early 80s, or merely the Emperor's New Hipster Jeans.  Meanwhile, dancepunk went on to disintegrate before our very eyes, flaming out even faster than most hastily-classified genres, with nobody digging past the most obvious influences (read: Gang of Four) to do more than echo <em>Echoes</em>. As the general opinion of the heady dancepunk days of 2003 faded into disdain, the Rapture-- as the sound's most-recognized face-- took the brunt of the negativity.</p><p>
    Into that unwelcome environment comes <em>Pieces of the People We Love</em>, the Rapture's third full-length and very patient followup to <em>Echoes</em>.  Even with the three-year vacation, <em>Pieces</em> seems destined to face a tidal wave of righteous anger from those who felt scammed by dancepunk's brief promise, a piñata to absorb the beatings of the jilted.  Fortunately for the band, <em>Pieces</em> turns out to be a strong (at times even spectacular) album, one that finds the band evolving from where they left off with <em>Echoes</em> while restoring some of the old hope that indie kids have, indeed, learned how to dance, and no longer have to be quite so obvious about it.
    </p>
<p>
    What the Rapture have returned with is a sound less concerned with retaining the raw, gritty punk half of the equation: From the fade-in harmonies and discrete four notes of bass-synth that announce the album, it's clear the group is going for a cleaner sound, surely helped by Paul Epworth and Ewan Pearson, who man the boards for eight of 10 tracks.  While nothing on <em>Pieces</em> reaches the velveteen club-readiness of ""I Need Your Love"", the band's previous muddy immediacy is replaced by a more meticulous approach: the keyboards polished to a glossy sheen, the guitars eased back into a supporting role, percussion real and programmed blended seamlessly.
    </p>
<p>
    It's impressive then, that even with this newfound attention to detail, the Rapture still maintain a flailing energy and enthusiasm that most of the other dancepunk bands could only fake.  The idea that one can, you know, actually <em>dance</em> to the Rapture is sometimes mocked, but tracks such as the sharp, sax-supplemented ""Get Myself Into It"" and the delirious Afro-funk guitar vs. merrily popping bass of ""The Devil"" approach that elusive concept known as ""groove.""  As with <em>Echoes</em>, Luke Jenner helps the songs he sings drop their inhibitions with his loose-hinged voice, building to a fake-orgasm crescendo on ""The Devil"" that's absurd yet logical.
    </p>
<p>
    ""The Devil"" keeps getting mentioned, since it's one of the standout tracks on <em>Pieces of the People We Love</em>, all of which share a common feature, or more accurately, familial resemblance.  The Talking Heads were, suspiciously, largely absent as an influence upon the dancepunk boom of 2002-03, but here the Rapture are avid pupils of their teachings, specifically mimicking the punk-to-funk transition period.  I'll leave it to the caretakers of music propriety to hem and haw; the Rapture do the tribute thing well, most noticeably on ""W.A.Y.U.H."" where the band bottles the itchy guitars, ringtone keyboards, and pseudo-tribal chants of <em>Remain in Light</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    However, what ultimately makes <em>Pieces</em> a step or three down from <em>Echoes</em> is a drop off in consistency, reflecting a higher percentage of songs that fail to ignite. Two of these are the tracks produced by Danger Mouse (the Cee-Lo-guesting title track and ""Calling Me""), which are content to coast along on fairly pedestrian beats.  Even though the group sticks mostly to what they know (read: songs about dancing) and they've stopped drawing inspiration from ""The Ladybug Picnic"", the Rapture still sometimes trip on the untied shoelaces of their lyrics; for instance, the incessant groove of ""First Gear"" would eventually win listeners over if not for Matt Safer endlessly stuttering with irritating dyslexia ""my-my-my Muh-Muh-Mustang Ford.""  Ambition also tends to get the better of them, like the ""Setting Sun"" vs. ""Firestarter"" electronica-hit pastiche of ""The Sound"", or the dopey psychedelia of ""Live in Sunshine"" (this album's counterpart to <em>Echoes</em>' equally out-of-place departure ""Love Is All"").
    </p>
<p>
    These missteps aren't deal-breakers, though, and for lovers of <em>schaudenfreude</em> expecting a Hindenburg of hype, <em>Pieces of People We Lov</em>e will be a disappointment.  The time for a statement on behalf of dancepunk is probably long past; it surely died when LCD Soundsystem spat ""Everyone keeps on talking about it/ Nobody's getting it done,"" or when it morphed into colorful dance-not-punk from the likes of the Go! Team or Cansei De Ser Sexy.  But <em>Pieces</em> nevertheless makes a statement on behalf of the Rapture alone, that they're a group with the exuberance, the right producer rolodex, and the right ear for influences to string together multiple albums that will persist long after their newsworthiness fades.

    to similarly bombastic, mouth-foaming performances. It's
    understandable. The boys have created an
    oeuvre that, while technically adventurous, is more or less a
    hodgepodge of ADD prog trope noodles. That said, I
    carefully
    cross my heart at the news of each release, hoping that
    approaching these guys with an open mind will unearth the pleasures that make bong-toting college boys and <em>Total Guitar</em> subscribers purr. But hard as I tried (again), <em>Amputechture</em> tested,
    bent, and eventually broke me: Synths lap, strings weep soppingly,
    ham-fisted fingers tap, time signatures flash, and the amphetamine Beat
    poetry...is amphetamine Beat poetry.</p><p>
    Now, I dig indulgence when it's done well (see: <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, that skinny guy who wins all the hot-dog eating
    contests), and what got me through multiple listens to <em>Frances the Mute</em> was
    the album's overall ludicrousness, that weirdo King Crimson
    corn-dogging. I enjoyed some of the vocal lines, and it had an
    intriguing concept-- characters flesh-out from found objects-- but the
    endless boogie eventually flatlined. It wasn't good rock music, but
    it was fun in a beer-helmet sorta way. But unless you do keg
    stands for a living, party tricks usually only work once. To the band's credit, at least they didn't
    aim for another classic-rock crapper like Frances's ""The Widow""-- if your <em>raison d'être</em> is sitcom-length epics, why plop in that
    one radio-ready single?</p><p>
    Here, the closest the Mars Volta come to a stadium-sized anthem is opener
    ""Vicarious Atonement"", in which slow-drip Led Zeppelin histrionics and
    drama-queen guitar wanks waddle over space ambiance, modem sounds,
    piano swirls, and free-jazzercise horns. The effect? Climbing a
    mountain with a noodling Sam Ash balladeer. (Actually,
    it's probably John Frusciante, who plays guitar on just about every
    track here.) Of course, the 7+ minute
    ""Been Caught Stealin'""-on-DXM shower ballad could've been
    trimmed by three minutes, but that's not a bad percentage for these guys.
    </p><p>
    As
    is illustrated by the 17-minute ""Tetragrammaton"". The move from
    ""Vicarious Atonement""'s saxophone bleats and Cedric Bixler-Zavala's mutant whine to
    the hyperspeed Dream Theater schlep is nice enough: The track's first few
    minutes show promise, but before long it's
    veered off into unlistenable, meth-addled Rich Little territory.
    ""Tetragrammaton"", of course, is the Hebrew name for God, but seriously, there's no
    reason to try to squeeze the entire dude into one track. How many
    scales can a person take? Leave the room, come back, go to sleep,
    take a walk: They're still at it. 
    </p>
<p>
    This
    isn't to say <em>Amputechture</em> is without redemption: ""Vermicide"" has a
    couple mellow and pretty guitar parts; actually, though, that's snuffed
    by the word ""sacrosanct,"" a ricocheting vocal effect, and
    late-period funk spunk. Heady hand drums, acoustic guitar flumes, and drifty gleams at ""Asilos Magdalena""'s opening are promising, but a quivering Cedric gets weepy
    on us. My guess: Mary Magdalene's pissed at Jesus for not taking her
    with him. Then I thought of Devendra Banhart for a second, before
    wiping off my windshield. The religious imagery's knee-deep in each
    track: ""Viscera Eyes"" rages about ""a crown of maggots"" and ""the
    border we're watching."" Somewhere Fred Durst nods along with a copy of
    <em>The Dharma Bums</em> in his back pocket.
    </p>
<p>
    The demonizing, idol-worshipping
    ""Day of the Baphomets"" opens with and sustains the most energy, but then comes a number of
    unnecessary shifts, including fun-house vocal effects and wavy gravy
    Lynchian midget sounds. The song features a legitimately kinetic
    vocal turn-- ""Poachers in your home/ Poachers in your home""-- that
    echoes Nation of Ulysses, but my finger's still off a few inches.
    </p>
<p>
    None of this is surprsing: It's the Mars Volta's
    third proper album and a blizzard of onanism is
    expected-- to quite a few people, it'll be highly anticipated. Hell, it even had<em> me</em> interested: This is ex-At the Drive In bassist Paul Hinojos' first studio stint with the band after he started touring with them in 2005. Maybe he'd
    turn back the clock and force his comrades to look in the mirror and
    see how far they've strayed off course? Sadly not. Which reminds me: Bixler-Zavala and Volta keyboardist Ikey Owens guest on Mastodon's<em> </em>new <em>Blood Mountain</em> album. Maybe they'll brainwash Atlanta's finest metal band into
    this kinda bullshit so the world can celebrate the crushing loss of two great bands together.<br/>

    Music blogs are totally the new solitaire. When I pad my midnoons with them, here's my mantra: Gimme gimme intelligent fandom-crit, just enough to make feverish mp3 consumption seem more sophisticated than gorging on Tootsie Rolls, right? But not all blogs worry with editorial panache; many are just hard-drive-clogging equivalents of the lunchmeat sample-lady at the grocery store, recommending semi-fresh (and free) carcass-morsels. The reception of (deserving) blogger darlings Tap Tap has consisted mostly of sub-paragraphs that sound like ads for cologne and perfume knockoffs: If you like Band Name Here, then you'll love Tap Tap! Days (or hours) later, multiple other seconding blogs refer (sometimes twice) to ""reading"" about Tap Tap via such prior brief slogan-entries. Folks, if that counts as reading, then the authors of parking tickets should be teaching advanced composition courses.</p><p>
    The lack of a critical dimension in Tap Tap's paperless trail is due largely to how desperately talented frontman Thomas Sanders appears to be-- these songs seem forced into the world by a buckling, overcrowded brain. The popcraft exhibited is light enough and ""now"" enough to reduce the listener to booster-mush on a first listen: perfect vouch-fodder for the busy, scoop-minded blogger. Tap Tap also juggles the freight of being a literal blog-baby: In a mess of conflictable interests, their record label is also a blog, run by a Pitchfork-linking, Pitchfork-staffer-Matt-Lemay's-band-releasing lover of the smart, yelpy, male white indie aesthetic.</p><p>
    ""Ryan Catbirdseat,"" as he calls himself, is someone to whom I feel comfortable typing Destroyer-nerd e-mails, after we exchange disclaimers about our mega-lofty label-head/CD-reviewer roles. (His label even encourages direct-to-artist ""tipping,"" as if to offset his Dischord-caliber pricing and the fact that bloggers, out of a weird courtesy to <em>each other</em>, try to give away distinct songs, resulting in much of their consensus-faves' music being yankable without purchase.) And goshdamnit, at the last drunken staff meeting, both of my editors introduced two temporary imperatives: 1) stop mentioning Pitchfork in Pitchfork content, and 2) actually describe music instead of A) analyzing imagined politics supposedly swarming around said music, and B) listing other band names as shorthand for said description. But poor Tap Tap can't help that their name, probably coincidentally, is a perfect blend of the double-word band-naming phenom and the net-buzzed Tapes 'n Tapes and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. Sure, they are totally in line with the many stellar smart, yelpy, male white indie bands with which Canada has lately blessed us. But nothing about <em>Lanzafame</em> sounds cannily preconceived (á la the Bravery, et al) or tested on hipster focus groups.
    </p>
<p>
    Thomas Sanders and his Reading, England associates are the real things of mimicry-core, in that they are obviously influenced by acts predating Wolf Parade and Arcade Fire, despite the vocal and momentum-doling similarities to those fine outfits. Various tracks all but homage boy-bands beginning with Beach and Soft. ""Here Cometh"" is an arch offering of Kinks blues, while ""Off the Beaten Track"" imagines a bizarro Belle &amp; Sebastian preoccupied with Kinks rock. Tap Tap will trigger the most vivid flashbacks in devotees of the founding fathers of the current smart yelpy male white indie aesthetic: New Zealand groups from the eighties. Taming psychedelia and punk into sloppy/pristine DIY pop, with more hooks than Leatherface's timeshare: that describes both Tall Dwarfs and (the more compact) Tap Tap. If you like Catbird Records, you'll love Flying Nun!
    </p>
<p>
    Reservations: The album employs one drum beat. The album contains session-muttering and little mistakes that besmirch the proceedings' ambition and class. The primitive-homemade vibe is more redundant than charming. Except for the forgettable finale, which might exist just to help <em>Lanzafame</em> hit the half hour mark, each song's quality is consistent, but the album is aurally incoherent, with engineering and fuzz levels of each instrument varying distractingly from track to track. Whatever, though, I could listen to Sanders sing ""can't"" like ""Kant"" all day, and all of the night. More infectious than viral, Tap Tap's promising debut revolutionizes nothing, and yet it sweetens almost any(white-indie)thing.

Despite cloying instrumentation and schmindie vocals extolling things like the virtues of Matthew Modine, the quartet's eponymous recordings got by on an awkward amateurish charm.  Part of that charm was a result of the group still finding its voice.  Even when the results were less than favorable (and a song about Matthew Modine's lusciousness is a hell of a thing to choke down), they were giving it the old DIY try.</p><p>
    On its debut full-length, <em>Make Love to the Judges With Your Eyes,</em> the quartet has come a long way, but often not for the better. Whatever darling ramshackle insouciance Pony Up! once flaunted has been subsumed by a boring ramshackle sincerity.  See one emo-esque record title for Exhibit A of this newfound maturity, and whenever they put away their toys and get serious, their po-faced songs write a check that their musical chops just can't cash.</p><p>
    The album starts with a prime example of this clumsy seriousness.  ""Dance for Me"" is a turgid ballad that tries to be both somber (""You rode in on a horse/ I took him, I took him down"") and sinister (""Because I've got that look in my eyes/ And you know I could just eat you alive"").  Maybe in someone else's hands, or maybe when Pony Up! get more miles under their belt, these moods would be evoked successfully.  Instead, we get four minutes of a peppy indie-pop group proving that they just can't drive in the slow lane.
    </p><p>
    They also can't do country-- ""The Best Offence"" is a game attempt at twang, but gets tangled in its dreary tempo and rote end-rhymes.  The production/engineering tandem of Arcade Fire knob-twiddler Howard Ian Billerman and Amerindie everyman Brian Paulson does the group no favors.  They simply record the band as-is, letting the group sink or swim on their own.  In the case of the slower songs, they should stick to the shallow end.
    </p>
<p>
    That said, this growing-up the group went through did wonders for its more spry numbers.  Exchanging their EP's pop-culture fixation for more serious considerations in this album's lyrics, however, lends their zippier compositions some welcome ballast.  Numbers like ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs (Is That They Die)"" and ""Make, Model, #"" manage to work out relationship-spawned angst without succumbing to it.  The album's best song, ""What's Free Is Yours"", plays off this friction perfectly, selling a line like, ""I don't care if you take my heart"" to both believers and cynics.  When Pony Up! are good, they're very, very good, and it's moments like this that give me hope these girls figure out their strengths when they return to the studio.

Unfortunately, mono-aural Adem's <em>Love and Other Planets</em> essays few (original) guesses about the Universe's mysteries-- it's an album about love and space that sounds an awful lot like, well, an album about love and love. The jacket for <em>Homesongs</em>, Adem's well-liked solo debut from two years ago, featured two hybrid bug-rooster-human creatures, one holding an umbrella, floating high above a sepia-toned cloudscape. It wasn't extraterrestrial, but it got up higher than this gravity-afflicted follow-up.</p><p>
    It seems a natural progression, at any rate. One seldom finds nuance screaming across the galaxy. <em>Love</em> is a gentler affair than its predecessor, perfect for hangovers and clear, breezy September mornings (I'm not even joking). Adem's breathy, pub-dued folk comes two ways: soft and Downy-soft. ""Launch Yourself"", a soggy pastoral driven by glockenspiel and brushed drums, generates the most momentum of any track, which ought to tell you everything.</p><p>
    But energy, besides being a function of rhythm, is also an act of will, and a strong will is something Adem lacks. <em>Love</em>'s percussion, for instance, is a shot in the dark: ""X Is for Kisses"" is dappled with lovable just-rushed staccato smacks, like Adem was tapping on his knee in the booth. I wish I hadn't figured out the song's not-so-dynomite lyrical gag, though: starting from A, every line begins with a letter one higher than the last, all the way up to Z, twice. </p><p>
    The record crests early (track five of 12) when Adem breaks from his usual sweater guy mumble to deliver a sort of album motto: ""On a clear night/ If you look close enough/ You can just make out love/ And other planets/ We are not alone."" But his voice is otherwise too retiring to animate such lyrical deadweight. Wallpaper your room with it when, on ""You and Moon"", which chimes like a clock shop come alive, he channels Robert Wyatt. Or let it bore you into a peaceful trance on ""Launch Yourself."" But for the kind of soul-caressing folk bobbins Adem aspires to deliver, go with Grizzly Bear.</p></div>"|9408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9408-love-other-planets/|6.2|Sam Ubl

    Many Yo La Tengo fans suspected the band's best days were behind them after <em>Summer
    Sun</em>. Even the title was a bummer. In my mind I saw it as <em>Setting Sun</em>,
    and later thought of <em>Around the Sun</em>, both of which brought to mind
    autumn twilight, a slow fade into darkness, and the onset of a deadening
    winter. And while the music wasn't terrible (and had at least an enjoyable
    ambience), it sounded like it came from a band that was locked into something--
    like Yo La Tengo had found a measured style they could tweak until they got
    bored of the band and called it quits. ""If this is truly the next step in
    Yo La Tengo's move toward some abstract concept like artistic maturity,""
    Eric Carr wrote in his <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/23360/Yo_La_Tengo_Summer_Sun"">Pitchfork
    review</a>, ""I don't think I want to stick around for the
    conclusion.""</p><p>
    Hearing their newest record, I'm hoping Eric hasn't left the building.
    From the opening bass growl of ""Pass the Hatchet, I Think I'm
    Goodkind"", it's a new morning on planet YLT. Right off, Georgia Hubley and
    James McNew are thriving on a riff and Ira Kaplan has his meanest distortion
    pedal out of hock kicking up clouds of noise because he can. And I'd forgotten
    how <em>cool</em> he can sound when singing. Here he's Joe Walsh bragging about a
    fully stocked medicine cabinet and the processing of
    his voice is perfect, with flanged midrange to accentuate his knowing calm. But
    Yo La Tengo wouldn't truly be <em>back</em> if they stayed in one place, and the
    following ""Beanbag Chair"" is a complete 180, a cuddly piano-driven
    ditty with velvety harmonies that wants nothing more than to find its way onto a
    prospective girlfriend's mixtape.</p><p>
    And that's the story here. Yo La Tengo have always sounded more in love with
    music than pretty much any indie band going, and they've let their diverse
    interests settle into a comfortable and productive place conducive to growing
    good songs. Everything they've done well in the past is found on here
    somewhere, even a couple of the gossamer mood pieces that previously threatened
    to smother their career like a damp wool blanket. An album of songs like
    ""I Feel Like Going Home"" might be trouble, but here it sounds just
    fine: There's lovely and subtle processing behind the piano and violin, and
    Georgia Hubley's voice has become a remarkably supple instrument. It's a real
    trick when you have her limited range to avoid sounding distant and bored, but
    completely inhabits her leads. The jaunty ""The Weakest Part"" hits the
    same sweet spot. It could be a nice Belle &amp; Sebastian song, with its bouncy
    piano, easy harmonies, and taut construction.
    </p>
<p>
    The production is simple but not minimal. It feels overtly
    ""classic"" more than anything, with arrangements and instrumentation
    deliberately plucked from a wide range of rock and r&amp;b sides from the past
    half-century. The horns backing James McNew's and Kaplan's falsettos on
    ""Mr. Tough"" are ladled from Memphis soul stew, punctuating the
    playfully phrased dancefloor challenge to a bully. ""The Room Got
    Heavy"", with its bongos and Martin Rev organ, is part skuzzy 70s-NYC racket,
    but Hubley humanizes and prettifies the drone and turns it into something
    approaching a song. The long instrumental ""Daphnia"", probably
    inspired by Yo La Tengo's now substantial movie-scoring side career, is more
    engaging than it has any right to be. It's just a guitar plucking a couple
    notes over and over while some crackly sound effects rustle in the background,
    and a creepy piano line ghosted from a John Carpenter score. And then, the
    scrappy ""Watch out for Me Ronnie"", with Kaplan half-yelling through a
    busted microphone, sounds like a lost <em>Nuggets</em> classic having a drink
    with the closing theme from ""WKRP in Cincinnati"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Yes, ""Black Flowers"" is underwritten and drab, and ""Songs for
    Mahila"" is pretty enough but just sort of floats out the window, but hey,
    there are 15 songs and 77 minutes of music here, and it's not a perfect record.
    But rather than sounding overstuffed, <em>I Am Not Afraid of You...</em> sounds
    like a double album in the 70s sense, a chance for the band to
    stretch out and try everything in their repertoire even if the end result is a
    little shaggy. Really, this kind of committed and sincere musical sampler is
    the most natural place in the world for Yo La Tengo to be, but it wasn't clear
    if they'd ever find their way back.

    The Black Keys were never meant to be classy. For one,
    they're from Akron,
    a city that's not quite East Coast or Midwestern and has vaguely smelled like
    burning tires every time I've driven through it. For another, they're playing
    blues-rock in 2006-- no irony, no kind of pretense to authority or being some
    new band of purists, just a blues-rock band. But even if their so-called ""raw""
    panache had been recycled a few times over, they had the kind of songs (""10
    a.m. Automatic"" chief among them) that demanded the car windows be cranked
    down and the volume knob twisted firmly to the right for anyone weaned on
    classic rock radio.</p><p>
    Now signed to elegant major-label imprint
    Nonesuch, their set up remains the same: one guitar and a set of drums. Singer/guitarist
    Dan Auerbach plays these unadorned riffs like the guitar was a harp, like their
    blues pillaging was a stately and noble pursuit, and these familiar riffs
    should be admired in and of themselves like museum pieces. I didn't expect to
    hear a 13-piece orchestra on <em>Magic Potion</em>, but nor did
    I expect to hear such a dry, austere record after the warmth of <em>Rubber
    Factory</em>. They whip up everything they can between just the two of
    them, Auerbach and drummer Pat Carney, but what they work up this time isn't a
    sweat-- it's restraint. On <em>Magic Potion</em>, the pleasures are
    coyer and the variations much more subtle from riff to riff, song to song. In
    other words, it's not the record I want to hear from the Black Keys.</p><p>
    There are few attempts to push the two-man band into newer
    territory, but those that do aren't necessarily welcome. ""Strange
    Desire"" is a worked-up staccato paean, leaning on cymbal tapping and heavy
    reverb like a ""No Pigeons""-style aggrandizing retort to the Kills'
    ""The Good Ones"", but squelches any of its novelty by rhyming
    ""fire"" with ""desire."" At the end of each verse. There are
    three verses. ""You're the One"" fares better, a slow honey drip of gorgeousness
    with some much-needed vocal doubling to further sweeten the deal, but it's not
    half as palatable as, say, ""The Lengths"" from <em>Rubber
    Factory</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    There's very little spark to early sequenced numbers ""Your
    Touch"" or the ""Heartbreaker"" retread ""Just a Little
    Heat"", but the latter half of the album does slow down and start to
    smolder. The title track makes the most of its space as Carney pounds in all
    the right places, showing restraint without losing the track's pulse. ""The
    Flame"" is a molten slow jam, as is ""Goodbye Babylon"", a
    stop-start stutter that stretches its quiet tension over a tricky chorus riff
    that would be awkward in the hands of any other band. But as <em>Magic
    Potion</em> shows, it's difficult to sustain an entire album of that
    almost-but-not-quite letting loose (and being a two-instrument band obviously
    doesn't help).
    </p>
<p>
    I'm not willing to
    rehash the argument over whether they have the right to play their sparse,
    occasionally unpredictable take on blues-- one of the most tired arguments there
    is-- because I couldn't care less whether they jacked their swagger from Muddy
    Waters, Led Zeppelin, or even White Stripes. They used to be a good time. They
    used to have songs. <em>Magic Potion</em> is a record where
    overwhelming competence meets measured restraint, but for me, sacrilege trumps
    sincerity, and I'd rather hear tuneful blasphemy than a tasteful snoozer of an
    album. Shit, give me Blueshammer any day.

    In some circles, Roman Candle have been one of the great unsubstantiated rumors of modern pop-rock. The Chapel Hill quintet's whip-smart 2002 LP <em>Says Pop</em> earned them a dedicated cult following, although it did little for their national profile: Hollywood Records furnished promos to critics, but never quite managed to get the record into stores. <em>The Wee Hours Revue</em> gives <em>Says Pop</em> a fresh coat of gloss courtesy of producer Chris Stamey, and new song ""I Can't Even Recall"", a languorous slow-burner in the vein of Van Morrison.</p><p>
    Stamey was a savvy choice: We already know from his overhaul of Whiskeytown's debut, <em>Faithless Street</em>, that he's adept at helping good songs hampered by uneven recordings achieve their full potential -- not to mention that Whiskeytown is the North Carolina band Roman Candle most resembles, although they're informed more by soul than country. While this is a passionate record (the word ""baby"" practically deserves an instrumental credit), Skip Matheny doesn't emote with alt-country's cowboy melisma. He belts out tough, full-bodied syllables with the barest intimation of a ragged edge. <em>Says Pop</em>'s unimpeachable melodies couldn't be contained by the occasionally tinny recording, but couched in Stamey's amply spacious production, they're explosive.</p><p>
    Instead of resting on the laurels of authenticity its direct, earnest songwriting would garner from some corners, <em>The Wee Hours Revue </em>aims for broader appeal by combining it with detail-oriented pop production. The percussion is remarkably crisp and buoyant, holding the crunchy snarls of guitar, spangles of Rhodes organ, and Matheny's towering voice effortlessly aloft. Pithy structural embellishments speak to the band's interest in various qualities of recorded sound -- the muffled drum section prefixing the bright acoustic lope of ""You Don't Belong to This World"", for instance, or the glitchy percussive overture that bursts seamlessly into the soul meltdown ""Another Summer""; the ambient static that Victrolas up the bittersweet cellos of ""I Can't Even Recall"" and the film-projector whir that sets the stage for the splashy ballad ""Baby's Got It in the Genes"".
    </p>
<p>
    These sharp compositional choices are also manifest in Methany's finely-drawn lyrics-- they create specific senses of place, situated at that nexus of lament and joy that's so much more stirring than either alone. On ""Something Left to Say"", summer is evoked by ""pollen on the beer bottles in the garbage cans."" On ""New York This Morning"", a city ""where father and son relations just deepen like a coastal shelf"" looms vividly, by way of pigeons on a savings and loan and candles at St. Patrick's cathedral. Such visual flair permeates the songs -- a kid playing guitar by the subway ""rolls a toothpick in his mouth,"" a strange woman packs ""cigarettes against her wrist,"" and ""an old button down with a cigarette scar"" evokes a Proustian reverie.
    </p>
<p>
    Like its namesake, Roman Candle coaxes incandescence from humble origins, and in this context, it's worth making the distinction between Southern Rock and rock that happens to be played by Southerners. The South, here, isn't about reconstructed stereotypes, and it isn't an end point. It's a literal space in which universal hopes and anxieties -- lost love, homesickness and wanderlust -- play out against robust pop-rock aerobics. You can check your dualie and shotgun rack at the door.

<em>Another Thought</em> was originally released in 1994, just two years after Arthur Russell's death from AIDS in 1992. At that time the enigmatic downtown NYC cellist/composer's work appeared to be in danger of fading into obscurity, with nearly all of his recorded material either hopelessly out-of-print or unreleased entirely. But in the last few years-- thanks to recent compilations like Soul Jazz's <em>The World of Arthur Russell</em> and Audika's <em>First Thought Best Thought</em>-- Russell's back catalog has undergone serious renovation, and his work has finally begun to receive the broad-based recognition it deserves. Within the context of this freshly refurbished discography, Orange Mountain's new reissue of <em>Another Thought</em> takes on a slightly different character, as this excellent collection can now better serve to connect the routes between Russell's various musical galaxies.</p><p>
    As most of his fans have doubtless noticed by now, Russell was an artist whose career defies easy synopsis. Formally trained as a cellist, his music seemed to effortlessly draw links between the outwardly incompatible vocabularies of No Wave/post-punk, space disco, and avant-garde modern composition. So it is probably for the best that <em>Another Thought</em> was never intended as greatest hits package or a comprehensive career overview. The collection was instead compiled by producer Don Christensen from the countless hours of unreleased tapes that Russell had recorded over the final decade of his life. Most of this material consists of eccentric, deceptively simple solo pop songs for voice and cello. And as suggested by the album's cover photo-- which depicts Russell nonchalantly sporting a newspaper pirate hat-- there's a boyish innocence and playful romanticism to many of these tracks, resulting in some of the warmest and most intimate performances of his career.</p><p>
    It remains unclear what exactly Russell's intentions had been for this material. He recorded so extensively during the 80s-- reportedly leaving behind as many as a thousand unreleased tape reels-- that it becomes difficult to determine which of these tracks he considered to be finished, and which were simply fragmentary sketches for future projects. In a strange sense, however, the unvarnished quality of these recordings generally works in Russell's favor. Unlike much of the homespun dance pop that appeared on Audika's 2004 collection <em>Calling Out of Context, </em>few of these tracks feature any of the lyrical or production earmarks that would necessarily date these recordings to the 1980s. Beguiling love songs like ""A Little Lost"" and the title track have instead a winsome, out-of-time quality that has aged them well-- an impression accentuated by the still-alien impact of Russell's percussive cello work and unique, expressive vocals. 
    </p>
<p>
    Over the course of the album, however, echoes of Russell's innovative work as a disco producer begin to reverberate on full-group tracks like ""This Is How We Walk On the Moon,"" with its exotic hand percussion, vocal distortion, and Black Ark-style horn section. On ""Keeping Up,"" Russell gets vocal assistance from the soundtrack-friendly pipes of Jennifer Warnes, their refracted voices doubling back on themselves as they encircle the cello's propulsive, almost subliminal pulse. And on the spellbinding ""In the Light of a Miracle,"" a longer version of which appeared on <em>The World of Arthur Russell</em>, the composer displays the full breadth of his peculiar alchemy by interweaving vocals and elements of classical Indian percussion and minimalist textures into his meditative proto-house rhythms. 
    </p>
<p>
    The inclusion of melancholic tracks like the world-weary ""Losing My Taste for the Night Life"" or the existential ""A Sudden Chill"" can give <em>Another Thought</em> an elegiac appearance-- and a certain air of finality-- that probably seemed more appropriate back in 1994 than it does today. These days, Arthur Russell's creative legacy seems to be in better health than ever, and with labels like Audika continuing to unearth previously unreleased Russell material it seems like it could be a long time before there's any need to finish writing his epitaph.

    Guess I should start by admitting that I know very little
    generally about the music made by ethnic minorities in Northeast Cambodia. If I
    have an area of expertise as a music critic, this is not it. Since we're talking about Alan Bishop's Sublime Frequencies
    label, the role of context is fluid. This is the 27<sup>th</sup> release in the
    series since it started a few years ago, and in that time Sublime
    Frequencies has become notorious while completely reconfiguring the way a
    certain audience-- indie kids, mostly-- understands the music of other cultures.</p><p>
    Sublime Frequencies' approach has ensured that the music is
    heard in a new way. Paradoxically, while the packaging and record titles
    present the music as coming from a weird, alien ""other,"" the
    haphazard presentation also encourages the listener to confront the content as
    sound first, divorced from culture. With all the scrambled signals and ensuing
    discord, the vague sense of guilt and legitimate questions about Orientalism,
    the first thing to do is put the CD in, press play, and see what happens.</p><p>
    Sublime Frequencies releases are generally split between
    radio collages, cassette assemblages, and field recordings, and this falls
    under the latter classification. Label associate Laurent Jeanneau spent three years wandering and recording in Cambodia's mountainous northeastern
    Ratanakiri province, where only 20% of the population is ethnic Cambodian. He
    recorded people making music in their villages in a wide array of styles, and
    edited the results down to this. As Sublime Frequencies releases go, it's
    notated pretty well, and Jeanneau has obviously done his homework about what
    the music means. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album begins with what one can only assume is a very old
    man half speaking something called ""Brao Legends"" as a baby and
    mother coo to each other somewhere in the background. The voice seems to be
    using some sort of throat singing technique, drawing up an impressive
    bass-heavy gurgle every few bars to alternate with words in his normal register
    with a Parkinson's quiver. Hearing it makes me think about the range of human
    expression available in the human voice-- it's like marveling over the phonetic
    pleasure of an unfamiliar language, how a different set of tools can take you
    to a similar place. 
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, the music impresses with its universality,
    suggesting that folk musics have common sources if they can be traced back far
    enough. More familiar to my ears is ""Jarai Ayin/Ayon Love Song"", sung
    by a woman accompanied by a man on acoustic guitar. Her clear, direct
    expression with the simple backing evokes devotion and tenderness, and the
    sense of dislocation is eerie, as the twisting melody and guitar backing are
    reminiscent of British folk. The vaguely Appalachian ""Jum Ho"" is played on a 10-stringed
    guitar-like instrument called a Gungteng and a one-stringed Krung, which is
    bowed and sounds like a droning violin recorded off a Victrola. 
    </p>
    Other
    tracks sound more like what I would expect from the region, with gongs, gourds,
    and bamboo flutes accompanying the singers. Some of it is rather shapeless and
    hard to latch on to, as pieces seem to slow down and almost stop at whim, while
    other moments are hypnotic and immersive. A mixed bag, to be sure, but that's
    to be expected from a somewhat random smattering of recordings from such a
    diverse region. Listening to it, I think less about what I'm learning about the
    music of Northeastern Cambodia and more about the specific character of each
    piece from moment to moment.</div>"|9324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9324-ethnic-minority-music-of-northeast-cambodia/|7.1|Mark Richardson

Despite the fact that two or three generations of music fans will secretly believe you have no soul if you don't announce your allegiance to it, despite that you probably already own it (in some cases, two or three times over-- if I could only remember where I put my 24-carat gold CD version), or that you may even have written an article for Pitchfork years ago making fun of anyone who dared criticize it, well, that's no reason to feel any pressure to make sure it's displayed prominently for guests, or worry that you haven't met your monthly ""God Only Knows"" listening quota.</p>
<p>Despite (or because of) the ""pressure"" to adopt pro-<i>Pet Sounds</i> stances in today's high-powered world of hanging out with your friends or staying home and getting high whilst listening to ""Let's Go Away for Awhile"", I'd wager most people are only too happy not to discuss the merits of the oft-oft-reported Beach Boys masterpiece. Certainly, regardless of what I write here, the impact and ""influence"" of the record will have been in turn hardly influenced at all. I can't even get my dad to talk about <i>Pet Sounds</i> anymore.</p>
<p>This isn't so bad. Beyond my personal preference for the records immediately following <i>Pet Sounds</i> (1967's <i>Smiley Smile</i> to 1971's <i>Surf's Up</i> in particular), I'd argue the actual sound of much modern music purportedly influenced by the Beach Boys is closer in execution to what the band did in the wake of <i>Pet Sounds</i> (and for that matter, <i>Smile</i>). ""Influence"" is a loaded concept here, because there's no foolproof way to measure how someone might channel inspiration from a single record, <i>Pet Sounds</i> or otherwise; however, much more certain is the feeling that very few musicians are making active decisions to ""try to top <i>Pet Sounds</i>."" In this light, just as with other perennially lauded pop/rock records, <i>Pet Sounds</i> is as much tautology as musical document. (Interestingly, this also seems to have been Brian Wilson's attitude beginning in mid-1967.)</p>
<p>Forty years after release, then, while the album's initially disappointing (at least to Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys) chart showing has been vindicated by a perpetual reservoir of new fans and adoring critics - not to mention still being commercially viable enough to support recent live productions and similarly perpetual ways of reissuing the music-- talking about the music, or how the music makes you feel isn't much easier than it was in 1966. Very famous people waste no time in offering testimonials to <i>Pet Sounds</i>' greatness, but (probably wisely) stick to short statements about how important the record was to them as artists and musicians, or just how beautiful its music is.</p>
<p><i>Pet Sounds</i> was made during the period in 1965-66 when Brian stopped touring with his band, preferring to stay home and work on tracks. His decision to work with lyricist Tony Asher for most of the songs freed him further to focus on music. This not only translated to backing tracks of considerably more nuance and subtlety than even Brian's recent apexes ""California Girls"" and the <i>Beach Boys Today!</i> LP, both from 1965, but similarly well-crafted chord progressions and choral arrangements. Almost predictably, as the deserved praise for the vocal arrangements may never wane, I've heard more fine things said about the instrumental tracks recently than any other aspect of the record. In any case, the technical achievements of the record (only given further support by the stereo issue of the record in the late 90s) have tended to overshadow the emotional and spiritual ones, at least in my lifetime.</p>
<p>This anniversary issue of <i> Pet Sounds</i>, including both the mono and stereo version of the record,      and a bonus DVD with several documentary features, surround sound mixes      and promo clips, will be of immediate interest to longtime fans for      obvious reasons (of which ""collecting"" isn't necessarily the least      important). In particular, the ""Pet Stories"" feature, with      recent interviews with Brian, Asher, session drummer and Beach Boy pal      Hal Blaine, and even an illuminating cameo from Elvis Costello, sheds      light not only on the original sessions and song origins, but on all      concerned parties' attitudes about the music now. Also very      cool is the footage of Brian and famed Beatles producer George Martin      listening to the original tracks; at one point, Martin twists a few      knobs and Brian is convinced he’s finally perfected <i>Pet Sounds</i>!</p>
<p>Also included in the set, of course, is the album; mono and stereo mixes of <i>Pet Sounds</i>, recapping the tracklist from the 1999 CD issue. The most famous songs-- ""God Only Knows"", ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"", ""Sloop John B"", ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"", ""Caroline No""-- are no less gorgeous than they have always been. The hymnal aspect of many of these songs seems no less pronounced, and the general air of deeply heartfelt love, graciousness and the uncertainty that any of it will be returned are still affecting to the point of distraction. Currently, there is a minor surge in support for the record's two instrumentals ""Let's Go Away for Awhile"" and the title track, though later efforts like ""Diamond Head"" and the quasi-instrumental ""Fall Breaks Into Winter"" (not to mention its parent track, ""Mrs. O'Leary's Cow"" from the <i>Smile</i> sessions) seem both more idiosyncratic and intrinsically interesting to me.</p>
<p>As it happens, Brian's instrumental arrangements for the album, while again justly praised (especially by other musicians), were related to concurrent productions by Juan Garcia Esquivel, Les Baxter, Martin Denny, and a host of other exotica producers, in both the kinds of instruments used, and the stylistic appropriation of, say, percussion and string instruments from other countries. In fact, Brian was the only one of these people not producing music in stereo at the time, which might explain why it took so long for bands (and not just the Stereolab kind) to borrow as much from his instrumental tracks as from his vocal ones, which cut through mono mixes much more effortlessly than the backing tracks.</p>
<p>So, the unfair question is: Do you love <i>Pet Sounds</i> enough to buy it again? Before you answer, here's a fairer one: How often do you need help recalling the emotions <i>Pet Sounds</i> provokes inside you? If you haven't lived with the record day in and day out, chances are, it's still a pretty fresh experience, and I'd recommend this set with absolutely no reservations. However, if the music is practically family to you already, I'd say check out the DVD stuff when you can, keep your current version, and watch the album's effects wind and rewind their way through lives and cultures in the meantime.</p></div>"|9371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9371-pet-sounds-40th-anniversary/|9.4|Dominique Leone

    You know the Bible story about Lazarus? Not the one where he becomes one of the first zombies, but the indecipherable parable that Jesus tells to piss off the Pharisees, about the rich guy who gives the beggar Lazarus his table scraps, and later the rich guy torments in fire while Lazarus goes to an afterlife cafeteria/lounge? Well, see, Pinback are the rich man (hey, their last album title referenced spending a hot season in a biblical-Jerusalem garbage dump synonymous with hell), and Lazarus represents Pinback fans, who will likely be paradisaically/purgatorially happy to feast on these surprisingly substantial scraps.</p><p>
    How low were the stakes for this back-in-the-day leftovers comp? Pinback have warned in publicity interviews that many of these tracks are ""half-done"" and that they ""fell through the cracks"" of lowly tour EPs. Yet the sound of early Pinback-- anemic grooves and clockwork beauty-- is so cohesive that <em>Nautical Antiques</em> avoids seeming scattershot.<span> </span>Of course, six of these tracks are even titled in the globetrotting-but-Eurocentric world-history mode of the band's self-titled 1999 album (""Versailles"", ""Clemenceau"", etc.). Such proper-nouning was presumably an artistic choice and not an attempt at savvy marketing for extended European releases, but it does seem like a fancy allusive smokescreen for what always appeared to be a pretty idealess band with a great sound/formula and fans who love the indie aesthetic that Pinback often encapsulates with era-specific dignity.</p><p>
    For example, several of these tracks feature spindly guitars over too-simply processed or programmed-sounding drums, whether or not they're actually being performed by Tom Zinser-- the demo of ""Seville"" is a fetching, white-funk riff played over one of the most overused breakbeat samples of the 1990s. Though this comp's offerings are dated, they're on par with (if not more musically interesting than) the best of the Folk Implosion's similar efforts, and way better than <em>fin de siecle</em> Primitive Radio God percussion-loop forays by alt-mainstays from Butthole Surfers to They Might Be Giants.
    </p>
<p>
    None of the Pringle-snap of recent Pinback is on display here; this comp is mostly about fructifying the lope and the plod. ""Avignon"" seems to tear the roof off the sucker by merely implying that it was crafted by beings with metabolism. That track is one of two fine piano-based dalliances included that alarmingly reveal Rob Crow to have been some kind of proto-Sufjan. (And lo, NPR loved them some Pinback in 2001.) Man, this guy can do palatable well, and then he can still go nuts as Goblin Cock.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Nautical Antiques</em> works both as a nostalgic springboard to the misty days of Milemarker and Versus, and as a relic of the nerdy, secular sexlessness of so much pre-9/11 post-punk. This version of Pinback was the opposite of Modest Mouse off-the-rails-ness; they made sober concentration-music at stoner-rock tempos, as if scoring a debate between Adderall and codeine. The soothing vocals hot up the mathiness, proving that an act can be calculatedly flaccid, yet seductive.

    The title of the Citizens' second album rather nicely
    captures 10,000-ish years of human history. Seriously, no one really knows
    where this is all going. We're just riding history wherever it may take us, be
    it to glory, ruin, or some boring place in between. The newspaper-hatted
    chimp in the cover painting captures drift perfectly-- his expression is so ambiguous  that you can read anything you want
    into it. Perhaps he's realizing he forgot to evolve.</p><p>
    The band behind the album cover-- now a quintet-- has evolved somewhat in the past two years. Though the basic sound of the Citizens is still the same, they exert more control over it this time out, locating a
    balance between the grit and sophistication their earlier material veered back and
    forth between.</p><p>
    Mark Lesseraux's songwriting is odd-- free-associative in a
    way that still implies a story, but always full of vivid imagery. His powerful
    delivery is a big part of making it work-- when he sings, ""We stopped for
    pancakes/ With buffalo wings on the side"" on ""Apache Strobe Light"", he sells it
    as something more profound than an incongruous meal. Likewise on ""The Creator"",
    which opens with the unforgettable couplet, ""I guess it must be true, I saw it
    in the newspaper/ The karate instructor weighed well over 300 pounds."" The song
    has a new wave bounce, but it's not really new wave-- the synths swirling through
    the beat have more of a science experiment vibe to them than a spiky call to
    dance.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Interstate Prayer"" is one of the band's best songs yet, a
    song about a kid who goes road-tripping alone to follow in the footsteps of his
    heroes, principally Jack Kerouac. The lines ""He read about it in books/ His
    friends and family giving him looks/ When you're a rebel/ They do that,""
    encapsulate the naïvete of the character's quest for identity through travel
    over a burbling bassline, thoughtful drums and floating guitar. Opener ""The
    Surfer"" is a mini-suite that begins as a clear, aquatic pop song with a
    crystalline chorus and then simmers down for a slow, plodding build-up to a
    crunching finale.
    </p>
<p>
    The band's ragged edges come out in the clanging guitars of
    ""In Your Stars"", which would make a great finale for the record. Instead, the
    band ends with a fine but inessential cover of Gary Numan's ""I Dream of Wires"".
    Still, to say that the band's originals are better than their covers is no
    great insult, and it's hard to find genuine false notes on <em>Post Cro-Magnon</em> <em>Drift</em>. The Citizens are still a young band with
    some evolving left to do, but it sounds like they're on the cusp of something
    great.

    Orange County-based surf-industry giant Clark Foam's sudden closure last December stoked fears the world over that the custom surf boards popular since the 1960s would be replaced by mass-produced models deemed fit only for noobs. Musically, of course, the good guys have already lost. The innocent grandeur of the Beach Boys and the dizzying guitar ripples of Dick Dale or the Ventures have long since faded into the Dave Matthews lullabies of Jack Johnson, the word's luckiest human being.</p><p>
    Over the course of three albums, Echo Park beach bums the Tyde have posed an alternative of sorts, with varying degrees of success. The group's core lineup remains intact on newest effort <em>Three's Co.</em>, natural successor to 2001's <em>Once</em> and 2003's <em>Twice</em>. Singer/guitarist Darren Rademaker and brother Brent played together in a shoegaze-influenced 90s band, Further (the latter Rademaker also belongs to Byrdsian space cowboys Beachwood Sparks); Darren's wife Ann Do Rademaker handles keyboards. Like its predecessors, <em>Three's Co.</em> mixes the sun-soaked power pop proclivities of Teenage Fanclub with the sylvan jangle of Felt, though the Tyde too often seem afraid to really make waves.</p><p>
    Maybe that's because they're thinking too much about other records-- a common plight, I confess. The Tyde's love of surfing, so evident on the last album in tracks like boogie-woogie ""Shortboard City"", is present here mostly in spirit, as the songs more frequently turn to music-geek griping and self-conscious reference-making. ""To the pastiche police/ Jealousy will get you nowhere,"" Rademaker spits through pre-2005 Strokes distortion on ""Brock Landers"", backed rather inconspicuously by the Thrills' equally seashore-sick Conor Deasy. ""The girls just keep on singing at the lamest shows,"" Rademaker whines more nasally on draggy, druggy ""Lamest Shows"". Copping a swampy two-step close to Bob Dylan's ""Things Have Changed"" for the verses of ""Ltd. Appeal"", Rademaker cannonballs into a harmony-drenched chorus of forced rhymes, noting, ""It won't matter who I steal my sound from.""
    </p>
<p>
    He's right, but probably for the wrong reasons: Despite their varied and estimable antecedents, the Tyde's tunes tend to spill together, notwithstanding a few catchy moments. Like ""County Line"", a ""Victoria""-joyous stomper, or vivid JAMC romance ""Separate Cars"". But then Maroon 5 bassist Mickey Madden guests, apropos of nothing, on ""Pilot"", a brash, choppy I'll-be-there-for-you (""When your dreams have let you down/ I'm the one who'll come around""). ""Aloha Breeze"" reclines into lap-steel balladry, while ""Glassbottom Lights"" jumps from chunky power chords to dreamy, synth-washed choruses to, on the U.S. version's bonus tracks, a moody James Figurine dance-pop remix. If everybody had an ocean, everybody'd still be surfing, but <em>Three's Co.</em> isn't ushering in a new golden age of foam quite yet. Just one word, surfers: plastics.

    According to most reasonable criteria, Beyoncé's second album <em>B'Day</em> is a success, outpacing her solo debut <em>Dangerously in Love</em>. Here, Beyoncé delivers precisely what many listeners have always wanted from her: a short, tight, and energetic set that's heavy on upbeat numbers and funk affectations, and light on the balladry and melisma.</p><p>
<em>
    B'Day</em> captures the r&amp;b singer at her warmest and most in-the-moment: There's a certain ramshackle messiness to these grooves, elliptically orbiting the classic pop song in a manner more reminiscent of Amerie's ""1 Thing"" than Beyoncé's sonically similar ""Crazy in Love"". Beyoncé sounds more relaxed as a singer, expanding on the Tina Turner resemblances she's been toying with recently, her performances growing ever-more instinctive and unpredictable in their appropriations of soul hollering. Most radically, the siren-assisted caterwaul of second single ""Ring the Alarm"" sounds genuinely (and marvelously) incoherent, her voice thrillingly sharp with anxiety and paranoia.</p><p>
    Remaining in soul mama character throughout, her newfound expressiveness fits so hand-in-glove with Richcraft or Neptunes-style funk drum patterns and surging horns that even when she departs from this style sonically-- such as on the percussive, Diwali-esque jam ""Get Me Bodied"", or the stiffly blaring ""Upgrade U""-- the shift feels negligible, and you can still hear the ghosts of horn sections. Beyoncé's lyrics are also funnier and more idiosyncratic than ever: ""I can do for you what Martin did for the people,"" she boasts on ""Upgrade U""'s extreme makeover hard-sell, and I suspect she knows she's the only r&amp;b singer who could deliver the line with a straight face.</p><p>
    So far so good, but what prevents this from being the classic pop album the above would suggest is that, well, Beyoncé simply isn't making classic pop anymore. By resolving the criticisms of her earlier work (too strident, too deliberate, too driven) Beyoncé has weakened her perfect pop technique. <em>B'Day</em> lacks the precision with which her earlier hits were crafted-- the alluring poise of ""Baby Boy"" is nowhere in evidence, and the glittering impregnability of the great Destiny's Child singles feels even more distant. <em>B'Day</em> sounds like an entire album of third and fourth singles, which is still better than an album of filler, but in a genre so overwhelmingly defined by its hit singles, a ""Crazy in Love"" or a ""Baby Boy"" can punch above its weight-- the consistency of ""Déjà Vu"" in this regard becomes a double-edged sword.</p><p>
    Most of all, though, Beyoncé just sounds too <em>real</em> here: It was her pitch-perfect plasticity which gave much of her earlier work its majestic aura, as if she had transcended ordinary goals in a narcissistic drive for perfection. Having voluntarily stepped down from her pedestal, she now struggles to inspire the same sense of awe: Her songs emote as intensely as before, but their emotions are all too human.</p><p>
    Ironically perhaps, this switch delivers its biggest pay-off, and <em>B'Day</em>'s best song, with the ballad-of-sorts ""Irreplaceable"". It's as if, having lost the Midas touch of gleaming pop perfection, Beyoncé has opened up the possibility of stumbling on brilliance by accident. ""You must not know 'bout me/ I can have another you in a minute/ Matter-fact he'll be here in a minute,"" she boasts to a swiftly exiting lover, in a hopelessly unconvincing attempt at callous indifference. Before, Beyoncé's approach to heartbreak was always literal, her voice and her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. ""Irreplaceable"" is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.

    The first line of any Mouse on Mars bio always says
    something about Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma meeting at a death metal concert.
    I think of this factoid whenever a loud and heavy MoM track comes on, something
    like <em>Idilology</em>'s ""First:Break"" or <em>Niun Niggung</em>'s
    ""Distroia"". While these tracks are obviously not ""metal"" in
    any sense, something about the way Mouse on Mars play with distortion and
    construct a godlike low-end thwack references the genre, however obliquely.</p><p>
    And now, they've released an album on Ipecac, the label run
    by Mike Patton, who certainly knows from metal. Appropriately, Mouse on Mars
    give Patton their heaviest and loudest album yet. This is alleged to be their
    more experimental offering, while they simultaneously work on another record
    that furthers <em>Radical Connector</em>'s pop experiments in collaboration with
    the Fall's Mark E. Smith. <em>Radical Connector</em> has its fans-- and it was
    certainly an original go at pop, taking riffs and hooks and melodies and wrapping
    them around sonics of baffling complexity-- but it only brought me with it about
    halfway. A few of the tunes still run through my head and I put the record on
    now and then, but large chunks of it I've forgotten.</p><p>
    But this is a different sort of experimental album from what
    we've heard from these two before (and it is two-- drummer Dodo Nkishi is
    absent here). In a sense, <em>Varcharz </em>takes the bouncy instrumentals of <em>Niun
    Niggung </em>and transforms them into something colder, blockier,
    louder, and flatter. The heavy thunder is most apparent on ""Düül"",
    which opens with a detuned bass riff run through a distortion pedal, recalling
    Lightning Bolt or Ruins if they were chained to a sequencing grid. It's a
    remarkably opaque and thick sound, and when during a break the spazzy
    electronic bleeps come pouring in, you begin to wonder how much more
    information can possibly be packed onto a CD. It's a terrifically fierce track
    that rocks harder than anything they've done. 
    </p>
<p>
    This being Mouse on Mars, the aggressiveness is cut with an
    undercurrent of humor, as the big loping riff of ""Düül"" sounds
    slightly lopsided and wrong. If Mouse on Mars has a unique identifier, it is
    this goofy, hobbling gait that always points to electronic music's more knowing
    new wave roots, the side of Ralf &amp; Florian that repressed a smirk when they
    went on about robots. So while this record is their most jagged and noisy yet,
    everything is done in a similar playful spirit, the half-smile helping to
    alleviate some of the fatigue that sets in when listening to the album straight
    through. It is, certainly, a tiring album, with thudding riffs caked with the
    sort of 8-bit distortion that wears you out. ""Igoegowhygowego"",
    squishy funk that contains a winking reference to Giorgio Moroder's yawning and
    dramatic synth drone in Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"", is a rare
    moment of levity. 
    </p>
    Most
    of the time there's a lot going on and it can be difficult to pull the
    individual units of sound apart. If you heard Jan St. Werner's 2003 album <em>Scrypt</em>,<em>
</em>there is a parallel here with the palette. There are no vocals, and few
    identifiable instruments; this is certainly a record born of machines and, I
    imagine, much of the raw material is computer-generated.<em> </em>For a band that
    began enamored with dub, letting instruments breathe while silence became
    another tool of composition, Mouse on Mars now seem concerned with density,
    trying to see how far they can go with layering without the whole thing
    unraveling. Turns out pretty far, but to what end, I'm not exactly sure. This
    is an impressive record in many respects, and its hooks and patterns only
    emerge after many plays, but it's also an oddly distant one. Which somehow
    seems appropriate to the subject matter. <em>Varcharz </em>is a tool, a weapon,
    not a place in which to live.</div>"|9379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9379-varcharz/|7.1|Mark Richardson

    In his review of Hu Vibrational's <em>Beautiful: Boonghee
    Music 2</em>, Dom Leone called eclecticism a luxury, the kind of thing that's
    ""more attainable when you don't have to sweat the basic shit."" That
    record featured Adam Rudolph and Hamid Drake applying their percussive talent
    to everything within reach in service of a neo-exotic vision where esoteric
    instruments were squeezed into every form imaginable; it was produced by the
    Los Angeles-based Carlos Niño, also of Ammoncontact, whose latest project is
    the Lifeforce Trio. Mr. Niño must not have to worry about the basic shit,
    because on the evidence here, eclecticism appears to be his middle name.</p><p>
    Niño's partner in the Lifeforce Trio is
    multi-instrumentalist Dexter Story, and the third member of the trio is filled
    out by whomever else they happen to be working with at the moment (eight people
    fit that description on <em>Living Room</em>). There's no overarching style at
    work, so they go where the music takes them. And here that means <em>TNT­-</em>style
    post-rock (""Tone Poem""), neo-shoegaze indie pop (""Space
    Flowers"", which leads to the carnival-of-sorts melody ""Carousel""),
    and lyrical after-the-rain jazz fusion (""Luminous""). What binds it together is a sense of restraint and economy. You expect an album like this
    to drag on too long, but at 37 minutes, <em>Living Room </em>feels thoughtful and
    precise. It's as if they had 20 ideas fleshed out and chose their nine best
    ones for the record.</p><p>
    Albums that jump around as much as <em>Living Room</em> does,
    like, say, Max Tundra's <em>Mastered by the Guy at the Exchange</em>, typically
    have a meta layer built in; they seem to be <em>about</em> music as strongly as
    they are <em>of </em>it. That's the feeling you get here, of an album
    interrogating various corners of music to see how they work. So
    ""Starship"", a 2:30 interlude consisting of a gently
    modulating Moog and dinky electric piano melody, is a puzzling but somehow
    correct lead into the three-part album centerpiece ""Blue Line, Watts Bound/The
    Shadows Took Shape/Soul Mates, Like Thunder and Lightning"". Here an
    opening rumble of field recordings and moody drones that sound captured from a
    misty wharf at 2 a.m. pile onto a freight train, hop off a few minutes later with
    splashy acoustic drums and Fender Rhodes chords, then close with a blue lamp
    soul groove complete with a small chorus of guys singing together wordlessly
    like the lost children of the Stylistics. Not the first combination that comes
    to mind, but it works.
    </p>
<p>
    The sense that anything goes is amplified by the two closing
    tracks, which are both tributes to influences. ""Alice!"" is likely
    about Ms. Coltrane, but features no harp or piano. Instead, it references the
    feel of her ""with strings"" records, as violin and viola saw away at subtly
    dissonant drones while a swell or organ and accordion bubble underneath. It's
    dramatic and striking, and builds nicely to a pitched climax. Then ""Orbit
    (Spaceways Radio Theme, Forever)"" closes the record, nodding to Sun Ra--
    another artist with a feel for eclecticism-- in its simple keyboard melody and
    ghostly voices that hear the cosmos as an extension of mid-century Disney's
    vision. What it all means, I can't tell you, but when the last clicks of thumb
    piano echo into the distance when the track comes to close, it's awfully
    tempting to hit the Play button again. It's too subtle to be a grand statement
    but as an entertaining way to spend half an hour with the stereo, <em>Living
    Room </em>delivers.

    The concept album is dangerous territory to tread, but apparently the Kingdom didn't get that memo. On the band's debut EP, <em>Unitas</em>, Kingdom singer/songwriter Charles Westmoreland fictionalized the life and NFL career of the legendary Johnny Unitas, recasting the crew-cutted Baltimore Colts QB as some sort of celestial body throwing touchdown passes across the cosmos. No, seriously.</p><p>
    Now, on the band's debut full-length, Westmoreland turns to narrating a heroic race in which ""the Kingdom racer"" pilots motorcycles, hydrofoils, airplanes, and even snowmobiles. To be fair, the record's conceit is hardly that transparent. Instead, Westmoreland simply weaves abundant vehicular imagery in with lyrics about pregnancy and hospitals, mountains and lakes, and a recurring color motif. But revisiting these images doesn't result in interesting associations between songs or a greater sense of coherence. Speeding by at a scant 25 minutes with three of the album's 11 tracks recycling the same melody, <em>K1</em> lacks much substance-- even if a number of these songs are incredibly catchy.</p><p>
    Songs like ""Motorcading"" and ""All I See Is the Sun"" burst with a concise energy, as if, like the racers Westmoreland sings about, they are trying to speed their way to the finish line. The band itself is tight enough to pull off the trick, exemplified in the hyperactive bounce of its rhythm section and the ridiculously nimble guitar solo that erupts in the middle of ""Die All Over Me"". But even when the music succeeds, Westmoreland's grating vocals threaten to kill the mood. As with his over-reaching concept, Westmoreland strains to sing in a pinched and affected timbre that reaches for soaring and expressive heights. On the cheeseball piano ballad, ""Polaris"", Westmoreland's nasal whine dances over chords, singing lines like, ""Your leather snowmobile jacket fits like a dream."" On ""Pilot"", the album's <em>a cappella</em> closer, he attempts to use his distinctive voice to his advantage, but it hardly ends the album on a high note. In echoing, multi-part harmony, Westmoreland concludes the album-long race, declaring, ""I'll be walking down the concourse with my helmet stained with stars."" 
    </p>
<p>
    In the end, the poor decisions that plague <em>K1</em> are all the more frustrating because of the potential the band clearly possesses. ""Higher"", which is augmented with some sweeping string flourishes, shows the band to be more than capable of writing succinct, irrepressible pop music. And the fragmentary ""Motorcading"", with its crushing drums and spindly synth riff, evidences that the Kingdom can inventively tinker with the mechanics of pop, as well. But even the most buoyant music can't keep Westmoreland's leaden concept from sinking.

    Over its decades-long existence, heavy metal has undergone several transformations, at times fading into the background, biding its time before emerging again as something new and refreshing. Throughout the early 1990s, bands like Death and Deicide seemed to inspire every longhair with a guitar to write blurred, panic-stricken riffs, and then growl painfully bleak lyrics about demonic possession or involuntary surgery. That's cool, though; there were some great bands back then. But just as with thrash metal a few years earlier, before death metal's initial light began to fade, critical mass was achieved. Too many bands were doing the same thing, forking every devil horn in the same manner, every head banging to the same beat.</p><p>
    A few years later, though, things were looking up as a new breed emerged, blending old-school death metal mentality with an increased emphasis on melody as well as hardcore's muscle and groove. But now here we are again, with Norway's Purified in Blood, whose <em>Reaper of Souls</em> tries its hardest to drive listeners to sacrifice a potato or something (the band are staunch vegans), but in the end just ends up sounding like a rote hardcore-influenced thrash band. The riffs are mighty, the tempos are appropriately blazing, and the vocals growl and screech with an admirable amount of bestial rage, but in the end there's not a lot to set the band apart from their peers.</p><p>
    That's not to say this is a bad album. On ""Gates of Gehenna"", the bridge riff is at once so familiar and exciting that if I didn't know better, I'd swear it was lifted from somewhere else. But it's just the bridge, a few seconds out of a four-minute song. The mid-section of ""Venom"" is also striking when the pounding double bass drops to a slow throb before launching into one of the album's most melodic riffs. It's a build up Dave Lombardo would be proud of, but it seems like Slayer-aping is the band's go-to trick to mix things up.
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, not every song houses even these minor moments of individuality. These tracks are so uniform that it becomes hard to tell them apart. The length of each track falls within a minute of the others, and every moment is relentless with guitar-noodling and vocal barking. Over a year ago, in a review of the Black Dahlia Murder's <em>Miasma</em>, I commented on how that band was able to take many of death metal's characteristics and update them without sounding derivative. It's disappointing that while Purified in Blood attempts the same feat, they rarely sound all that inventive. Frankly, they just end up sounding a little too much like the Black Dahlia Murder.

    Consider Grizzly Bear's cover of Yes' ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"",
    recorded some time ago and included on <em>Sorry for the Delay</em>, the
    mini-album collection of demos and early recordings released earlier this year.
    It finds leader Edward Droste struggling to meet the challenge of the song's
    strange angles and tricky construction with just an acoustic guitar, mostly by
    piling on intricately arranged vocal harmony. He slowed the song to half-speed,
    in part because half-speed is how Grizzly Bear like to do things, and in part
    because he needed the extra time to get the voices just so. Ten years ago such
    a cover may have seemed like an ironic appreciation of a corporate rock
    standard; that Grizzly Bear looked to the pop Yes back then is key, because it suggests
    that Droste is not afraid to get complicated and that he believes in the
    potential of widescreen sound.</p><p>
    This faith in something bigger is all over <em>Yellow House</em>, the band's
    second full-length and debut on Warp. It's not what you might expect from
    Grizzly Bear after hearing the apartment-recorded <em>Horn of Plenty</em>, the
    2004 debut that was essentially a Droste solo record. Grizzly Bear seemed there
    like any number of post-Microphones indie bands stuck in the realm of lo-fi for
    lo-fi's sake, ready to let pinched, tinny sound create intimacy when the songs
    themselves couldn't quite manage. None of this early Grizzly Bear material is
    bad, but it has a tendency to drift away completely once the music stops, and
    after the remix companion to <em>Horn of Plenty </em>came out, people seemed to
    lose interest in the originals.</p><p>
    That's all behind us. Grizzly Bear are a full band now, Droste being joined
    again by Christopher Bear (on drums, the only holdover from <em>Horn of Plenty</em>),
    Chris Taylor (on electronics, woodwinds, and bass) and Daniel Rossen (who
    sings, contributes to songwriting, and plays guitar). They're still recording
    themselves, but they've grown more ambitious and seem to have acquired some
    decent gear. The studio this time was a living room in Droste's mother's place
    near Cape Cod; their own private Big Pink is, indeed, yellow, and they
    apparently had a lot of time to think about arrangement. No question this
    grander sonic space is where they belong. Opening track ""Easier"" lays
    it all out: flutes, a descending intro tapped out on a rickety upright, sustain
    pedal to the metal, a smear of fake strings (Mellotron?), and then the acoustic
    picking and Droste's voice, clear and full-spectrum for the first time and
    sounding, finally, like it should.
    </p>
<p>
    The following ""Lullabye"" is the album's calling card, the
    production this time supporting a meandering tune that skips up the side of a
    mountain. Grizzly Bear exhibit here a tendency that recurs throughout the record,
    of showing the seams in their songwriting and dividing the songs into
    mini-suites through jarring moments that signal a shift in emphasis. A
    discordant guitar tears ""Lullabye"" in half, separating the tuneful
    opening, which sounds like a lost Disney tune written to send a rosy-cheeked
    imp off to sleep, from the dark tower that looms behind. The second half's
    swirling harmonies and crashing drums evoke a Bob Ezrin-sized edifice that
    would leave a four-track recorder in a dozen pieces before the first brick was
    laid. 
    </p>
<p>
    Such attention to detail and the larger well of resources improves Grizzly
    Bear at both ends of their range. The quieter songs sound better laced with
    effects and with the guitar and voice ringing true, and the climaxes carry
    greater weight. Another example of the latter is ""Plans"", which
    begins with a modest shuffle, picks up a chorus of whistling dwarves and some
    horns on loan from Tom Waits, and finally piles on some go-go nightclub
    percussion and laptop dissonance as it begins to buckle under its own weight.
    The imagination of its arrangement is impressive, as is the perfect 30-degree
    slope upward to its peak. 
    </p>
<p>
    That's one end of the spectrum. But then they slip in something like the
    regal waltz ""Marla"", which was written by Droste's aunt in the 1930s
    and carries the sparkling dust of its vintage. Grizzly Bear infuse the song
    with a palpable atmosphere, the live instruments mixing with indistinct sounds
    courtesy of Chris Taylor's slippery electronics. He seems to be filling a role here
    similar to David Sitek in TV on the Radio, folding in odd noises at just the
    right moment to color the tunes in a very specific way. So ""Marla"",
    with its strings and accordion, suddenly opens up at the two-minute mark, when
    an echoing memory of a ""sweet"" big band 78 streams in for just a few
    seconds. ""On a Neck, On a Spit"" contains similar tweaks during its
    crashing instrumental break, with hard-to-peg wails that could be voices or
    could be strings but jack up the drama regardless. 
    </p>
<p>
    Beyond production, Grizzly Bear have stepped up their songwriting in every way,
    assembling melodies that proceed in a logical fashion but never sound overused
    or overly familiar. <em>Yellow House </em>is a much better record than we could
    rightfully have expected from these guys, better, even, than we could have
    imagined them making. And I find myself wondering how much further they might
    go, whether another layer of sheen and more production possibilities would push
    them to even greater heights. There are still moments here where the sound
    isn't quite all it could be. More money, a better studio, and who knows what
    might happen. And hey-- what's Trevor Horn going for these days? Ah, a question
    for another day. For now, we have <em>Yellow House</em>, one of the year's best
    records.

    Per the billing in its subtitle,<em> Serene Velocity</em> is an anthology of Stereolab's 11 years on Elektra Records: a career retrospective, primer, beginner's guide, portable collection, or any of the other names we give greatest hits albums from bands who can't claim to have actual conventional hits. Not the most exciting concept in the world, but it's certainly a useful one. This is a band we talk about a lot-- in passing references and comparisons, as critics' shorthand, as a touchstone. And yet a curious newcomer who tracks down their bin at the store may well find 10 full-length albums, four collections of EPs and singles, and plenty of sundries besides: Fifteen years (and counting) of fairly varied work, with a partisan somewhere to claim any given era is the best one. For the curious newcomer, it's daunting.</p><p>
    And of course with every year that passes since the starting point of rock, there are more and more perfectly brilliant, worthy bands we just couldn't possibly find the time to listen to in any comprehensive way, which is precisely why things like this exist-- so that, assuming this package doesn't get one-upped, someone ten or fifteen years from now can ask the question: ""Do I need to buy all those Stereolab albums, or is <em>Serene Velocity</em> pretty much going to get the point across?""</p><p>
    Which makes it a bit harder to judge this package in the present. It's certainly a sensible approach: 18 chronological tracks (released between 1993-2004), with a title that references both an avant-garde film and the odd duality that marked the band's early work-- speedy organ buzz meets sedate, elegant swing. Stereolab is a touchstone, and this is a collection of touchstone tracks: It even starts with the 7"" edit of ""Jenny Ondioline"", the 18-minute slice of droning, Germanic pop that first made them seem genuinely important. (In 1993! When even Sonic Youth were flirting with the conventional alt-rock gold rush! When-- trust me-- even music geeks didn’t necessarily talk much about Neu!) There's ""French Disko"", the band's signature organ-rush pop single; ""Ping Pong"", the minor hit that announced their turn toward moon-landing dreams and mini-skirt swing; three tracks from <em>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</em>, still their best record; two from the skittery digital world of <em>Dots and Loops</em>; and six check-ins from records hence, on which the band didn't seem to be doing anything <em>wrong</em>, and yet started to feel the slightest bit mannered, routine, and lifeless.
    </p>
<p>
    Not much you can argue with, touchstone-wise. And it's all still terrific listening, thanks mostly to that whole odd-duality thing. The beauty of this band, through the 90s, was the way that their ""experiments"" were always experiments in pop: Even when their obscure influences now seem fairly common, and even when their stylistic oddities have been copped by enough other acts to make them seem standard, the songs themselves still come off fine-tuned and lovely, passionate and convincing, each one individual. The liner notes here are right to point to Stereolab's fixation on retro-futurism-- the way ""futuristic"" visions from the 50s and 60s now seem so quaint and idyllic, like the past and the future at the same time-- and to hope that Stereolab's sound will age just as well. Gone is the feeling of importance and progress that used to attach to this act. But give it a decade or two, and that'll leave their records feeling exactly like the dreamy period oddities they themselves admired. Future discoveries of the strange psychedelic pop on <em>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</em> may feel a bit like today's discoveries of the strange psychedelic pop on an old Free Design album; future discoveries of the sedate swing on <em>Dots and Loops</em> might feel like today's purchase of an old Françoise Hardy LP.
    </p>
<p>
    The only funny part is the vaguely defensive tone of those liner notes, which go out of their way to point out that Stereolab ""are very much an active band today,"" and to let guitar player Tim Gane express surprise that people ask him whether it's time for a change; it feels almost like an apology to the band for releasing yet another back-looking collection, another sign that things are wrapping up. But if this were to go down as the definitive Stereolab summary, Gane and company could certainly be proud: The first two-thirds of this record contains some of the best music of the 1990s, flat-out. And of course every greatest hits album needs to trail off a bit at the end, if only so you know which albums not to be as interested in. The main sense in which I can imagine anyone one-upping this as the go-to summary is just by giving you...more.

    It's been 25 years since we last heard from
    Australia's mighty Radio Birdman, long enough for even their most devout fans
    to have consigned them to history. Formed in 1974 by Michigan-to-Sydney
    expatriate guitarist Deniz Tek and vocalist Rob Younger, these proto-punk
    pioneers actually disbanded in 1978 before their last album <em>Living Eyes </em>ever
    saw a commercial release<em>. </em>But their powerhouse body of work-- as now
    best appreciated on Sub Pop's <em>1974-1978: The Essential Radio Birdman </em>collection--
    has since continued to garner the band an extensive and enthusiastic
    international fanbase.</p><p>
    Radio Birdman re-formed in their original line-up in
    1996 to play Australia's Big Day Out festival. That performance eventually led
    to further European tours, festival gigs, and now to the wholly improbable
    appearance of <em>Zeno Beach</em>, their first album of new material in nearly
    three decades. The album features four of the band's original six members--
    Tek, Younger, guitarist Chris Masuak, and keyboardist Pip Hoyle-- but this
    reunion is no mere nostalgia trip. As with the resurgent Mission of Burma, here
    Radio Birdman return from their long absence with all engines lit and burning,
    crafting an album whose astonishing force and vitality matches and at points
    even surpasses their vintage material.</p><p>
    Along with such U.S.-based groups as the Dictators or the
    Flamin' Groovies, Radio Birdman in their original incarnation actually belonged
    to the generation of bands that emerged immediately prior to the outbreak of
    punk rock in New York and London. Like many of their peers, Radio Birdman drew
    inspiration from the primal sounds of <em>Nuggets</em>-era garage and Detroit
    rock-- their name is borrowed from a Stooges lyric-- but also routinely nicked
    from such pre-British Invasion influences as surf instrumentals and Little
    Richard. (They were one of the few proto-punk acts to regularly employ keyboards.)
    All those classic pro-rock elements remain firmly in place on <em>Zeno Beach</em>,
    and are here further juiced by the addition of the burly new rhythm section of
    bassist Jim Dickson and former You Am I drummer Russell Hopkinson. 
    </p>
<p>
    This revamped rhythm section wastes no time in throwing
    around their considerable weight, helping to deliver the opening ""We've
    Come So Far (To Be Here Today)"" with an almost Jesus Lizard-like pummel.
    On this track vocalist Younger sounds every bit like a man who has been waiting
    years for this moment, snapping into the song's wry lyrics with an audible
    relish. His voice has weathered the intervening years remarkably well, and his
    slippery, smoke-cured croon recalls Mark Lanegan on tracks like the chiming,
    elegiac ""Die Like April"". Guitarists Tek and Masuak, meanwhile, have
    apparently spent most of the past couple decades stockpiling riffs. In their
    prime, Radio Birdman were always as much about crafty songwriting finesse and
    deft musical interplay as big punchy choruses, and that tradition continues on
    the enfolding, hook-filled likes of ""Remorseless"" or ""You Just
    Make It Worse"". 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Who were you in your heyday? Did you blow up or
    lose your face?"" asks Younger on the slinky ""Heyday"", one of
    several tracks on <em>Zeno Beach</em> that reflects openly upon the hard mileage
    of the passing years. There are moments-- such as on the lukewarm E-Street
    upswell of ""Found Dead""-- when Radio Birdman threaten to show their
    age (and their old fondness for Blue Öyster Cult) by slipping a bit too comfortably
    into rote classic FM rock gestures. Like all their classic work, however, the
    best songs on <em>Zeno Beach</em>-- like the bizarre, secret-handshake anthem
    ""Brotherhood of Al Wazah"" or the title track's hot-wired surf rock--
    sound like they'll absolutely shred in a live setting, and the final impression
    is that of a talented group of friends ecstatic to be once again in each
    other's creative company.

    The Relapse logo on comedian
    Brian Posehn's debut album pretty much says it all: if his fellow ""Mr. Show"" alum David Cross is the funnyman of choice for indie-rockers, Posehn speaks to
    another perennial underclass-- the metal-heads.  Or rather, thirtysomething middle-class metal heads who,
    between getting married, walking the dog, and mowing the lawn, have lost the
    follicular capabilities to bang a full head of hair. On more than one occasion
    on <em>Live In: Nerd Rage!</em>, Posehn refers to himself as a ""total metal dork"" and (of
    course) ""nerd,"" but the constant declaration of his loser status starts to feel
    like a forced attempt to assert an identity, reducing his entire act to an easy
    game of word association (see Seinfeld: nothing or Gallagher: watermelons). When
    Posehn recounts anecdotes about being pestered by jocks, I don't doubt he
    speaks from experience. The irony is, they're the very audience that would lap
    up his potty-mouthed stoner shtick.</p><p>
    Despite Posehn's imposing physical
    presence (metal height: 6'66"") and Deicide shout-outs, <em>Nerd Rage!</em> doesn't rage very
    much at all; it's more like Nerd Resignation. Posehn is an affable character,
    and as crude as he can be, his vulgarity is more jovially immature than aggressively
    offensive. But those drawn here by Posehn's ""Mr. Show"" pedigree will be surprised
    at how little the material here deviates from standard brick-background
    stand-up fare: petty arguments with the wife, jerking off to porn, the sexual proclivities
    of household pets, the absolute suckiness of <em>Star Wars Episodes I and II</em> (though
    Posehn is the first comedian I've heard compare the experience of watching <em>The
    Phantom Menace</em> to having your uncle force his weiner into your mouth).  Consistent with Posehn's self-professed
    addiction to marijuana and Halo, <em>Nerd Rage!</em>'s 90-second riffs fly by with scatterbrained,
    channel-surfer randomness, meaning his anecdotes never really accrue momentum or thematic resonance. Forays into weightier political territory-- like his
    inspired supposition of a post-war future where Iraq becomes America's cultural
    ally, like Japan after World War II-- unfortunately last as long as it takes to
    read a news-scroll item on CNN Headline News.</p><p>
    However, if Posehn's ""Mr. Show""
    tenure has taught him anything, it's a studied self-awareness about his chosen
    medium: Perhaps it says too much that my loudest laugh came when Posehn suddenly
    switches topics from dogs to religion and shrugs, ""I haven't written a segue
    since 1990."" Posehn scores most consistently in meta mode, a point driven home
    by <em>Nerd Rage!</em>'s three bonus musical tracks: A song called ""Metal by Numbers"" (featuring
    Anthrax's Scott Ian and Armored Saint's Joey Vera) where Posehn's Cookie Monster growl guides you through the song's cookie-cutter structure (""this
    is the gay part with melody!""), a rehash of ""Mr. Show""'s second-best metal spoof-band, Titannica,
    prefaced by a radio interview where the DJ decries unnecessary reunions. It's a good thing Posehn's congenial, everydude demeanor allows us to overlook meta-comedy's potential pitfall: that jokes about clichés can easily
    become clichés themselves.

    In any other year Brisbane's cute-as-a-lifestyle garage
    rockers the Grates would own the title for best female-led rock band to
    needlessly work ""motherfucker"" into a song. High praise, huh? Unfortunately, Be
    Your Own Pet claimed that crown on their 90-second rally cry ""Bunk Trunk Skunk"",
    from their self-titled debut album. On the BYOP song, lead singer Jemina Pearl
    riles the sort of knuckle-cracking fury only a teenager could conjure as she
    shouts, ""I'm an independent muther-FUCKER."" The Grates' Patience Hodgson, with
    nearly the same pitch, but a tamer style, opens ""Inside Outside"" with the
    cheekier ""Some motherfuckers think they're born to dance."" Slight discrepancies,
    but sometimes that philosophical divide is the difference between a searing
    debut and stylish reach.</p><p>
    The electric Hodgson, who sounds like she's riding a
    jet-fueled pogo on almost every song, is joined by guitarist John Patterson and
    drummer Alana Skyring, who make a sweet, playful style of basement band music. Occasionally
    it steers straight, but it mostly just zooms rudderless. On the strength of
    ""Trampoline"", a sloppily recorded gutbuster brimming with coy sexuality (sample
    lyric: ""Use your bed like a trampoline, just for love if you know what I mean"")
    from their debut EP, <em>The Ouch. The Touch</em>, the trio gained notoriety in their
    native Australia.
    That song is included here, in a re-recorded form thanks to boardsman Brian
    Deck, whose sturdy hand has
    the band recording cleaner, tighter versions of songs that probably shouldn't
    be so tidy. He sucks Patterson's guitar dry of feedback, crystallizing the
    grubby quality that made Hodgson's chirpy wails so enticing. The rank
    comparisons are already flowing on Hodgson: An adorable Karen O, Ari Upp on
    crunk juice, a hornier Corin Tucker, and so on, hardy-har-har. Don't buy it.
    She's not a fully-formed songwriter yet. In a live setting she looks ready to
    burst into flames, bouncing around on one foot, whipping her head around like a
    NASCAR crowd following the track. On record, her charisma seems like it's
    fighting in spite of itself.</p><p>
    What the Grates have got going for them on record is a foot-stamping simplicity to nearly all of their tracks. ""Lies"", which lifts a Pixies riff during the bridge, is one of
    the few muddy numbers here, and it excels. Even shrill opener ""I Won't Survive"" has a winding melody thanks to Patterson's
    reedy tuning. When Hodgson avoids Gwen Stefani circa <em>Tragic
    Kingdom</em>, she's liable to write to
    write a hit, too. Bluegrass-stained stunner ""Sukkafish"" isn't that song, but Hodgson
    gets to be brassy, whilst the band gets to make chord changes for a change,
    shifting into banjo-plucked serenity and out of chockablock riff-town. But only
    the scorched rainbow jam ""Science Is Golden"" completely accomplishes what this
    band shoots for. Here, Hodgson lets her lippy vibrato stretch out, but she
    doesn't push her limits too far. And the band never rushes her through the
    perfectly sung chorus.
    </p>
<p>
    What's great about the Grates, is also what vexes (see,
    we didn't do the Grate/grate pun). They're spunky and funny. Their sound is
    consistently chippy. And they're happy! Which is swell for 16 minutes. Over the
    course of a usually-digestible 40 minutes, the candy starts to get stuck in

    banjoes, and a clean recording atmosphere. They might be better served heading
    back to the basement.

    be its drunken papacy. Two men who have spent their career outrunning the
    disco loop that would try to contain them, each new Basement Jaxx record has
    been a cowabunga leap forward in an often conservative genre. Where others
    say go slow, Basement Jaxx says more, now, faster. And loudly. A day-glo
    spooge of all the best bits from every genre known to man, their last
    record, 2003's <em>Kish Kash</em>, was a Lisa Frank trapper keeper come to
    life.</p><p>
    But while the new <em>Crazy Itch Radio</em> is still a rainbow-colored world
    inhabited by puppy boomboxes and talking unicorns, it's not as concerned
    with grabbing you by the lapels and shouting ""look!"" every 15 seconds. My
    esteemed Pitchfork colleague Tim Finney compared the album to the
    Avalanches, and like the Australian band's <em>Since I Left You</em>, there's a
    sparkling glide, a connective boomp, a disco snare that attempts to reign in
    all of the Jaxx's excesses. It makes <em>Crazy Itch Radio</em> feel less manic than
    it actually is. If <em>Kish Kash</em> was like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, this is an
    Epcot Center monorail trip through Basement Jaxx's record collection.</p><p>
    At the time, I thought <em>Kish Kash</em> was something close to the perfect
    pop album. It's more like the musical equivalent of playing Katamari Darmacy
    for eight hours straight or eating an entire bag of fun-size Hershey bars:
    feels great at the time, but oh that headache/toothache/feeling of
    recrimination the next day. Maybe I'm just getting older and need more
    roughage in my diet, or maybe the iPod has rendered the whole concept of ""an
    album as the world's greatest mixtape"" irrelevant. Listening to Prince and
    gypsy music back to back is no longer a big deal, if it ever was.
    </p><p>
    And yet I'm not 100% keen on the less spazzy <em>Crazy Itch Radio</em> either.
    Despite the sandblasted smoothness of its surface, <em>Crazy Itch Radio</em> is
    still very much Basement Jaxx showing off how eclectic they can be. Much of
    it sounds like the two spent the past three years listening to the
    roller-boogie bounce of mid-80s r&amp;b and Latin freestyle. And there are
    certainly worse sounds to revive. Lead single ""Hush Boy"" takes off from
    interim single ""Oh My Gosh"" with sassy female lead vox, bopping b-line, and
    parping horns. You almost forget it's two middle-aged men trying to be
    cutesy rather than the puckish sass that comes natural to vulgar teenagers
    who would think Radcliffe and Buxton were, like, all old and shit.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Hey You"" is the album's standout, a gypsy/klezmer mash-up along the lines
    of the recent, excellent, and Jaxx-compiled <em>Gypsy Beats and Balkan
    Bangers</em> compilation. New single ""Take Me Back to Your House""-- do
    yourself a favor and hit up YouTube for the video-- rollicks along to a
    jangling country house banjo. They're fun little songs, but they're songs
    that put all the hard work of having personality on the bits and pieces they
    stole from other countries and cultures. And those who were fans of the old
    records' ragga dancehall roughness and rave'n'roll noise will have to wait
    for the inevitable remixes. (Also, fake radio jingles between your songs
    haven't been a good idea since <em>The Who Sell Out</em>.) But if, as Martin
    Clark asserted in his recent Month In Grime column, London pirate radio is
    steady banging to the sound of funky house these days, then Basement Jaxx
    might have their finger more firmly on the pulse of inner city London than
    you'd suspect from <em>Crazy Itch</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    They're big on groove and three-ring spectacle and cheeky jokes, but
    songwriting has never been Basement Jaxx's forte. ""Red Alert"" and ""Where's
    Your Head At?"" aren't pop songs, they're tarted-up dance records, and that's
    probably why they ended up in Coke and Dortios commercials and not on heavy
    Top 40 rotation. This year's Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake
    singles are <em>very</em> Basement Jaxx-- better, in fact, than anything on
    <em>Crazy Itch Radio</em>-- and work better as pop songs to boot. And this is
    the first time it feels like Basement Jaxx is maybe kinda sorta pastiching
    themselves. Rent-a-diva vocals, a beat that's too fast to be pop and too
    slow to be house, and a lot of crazy noises…that's <em>so</em> Basement Jaxx,
    right?
    </p>
<p>
<em>Crazy Itch Radio</em> isn't a bad album by any means; it just doesn't
    scream ""best album of the year"" from the moment you put it on. On the other
    hand, it could be a brand new kind of Jaxx album: A grower, one that doesn't
    exhaust you the first time around the track but one that accrues meaning and
    gets more enjoyable with each new spin. (It's certainly less front-loaded
    than their first three records.) We all slow down as we age, and while no
    one wants to be the old guy in the club in the too-hip T-shirt, the idea of
    a ""mature"" Basement Jaxx is an intriguing-- if potentially terrifying--
    idea.

Stretching from the 1979 release of his eponymous second album to the 1992 ""love symbol"" record, the collection follows in the footsteps of
    1993's <em>The Hits</em> (two separately available CDs, also packaged with <em>The B-Sides</em> in a box set) and the skimpy single-disc collection <em>The Very Best of Prince</em>, which was lost in the shuffle upon release in mid-2001.</p><p>
    It's nice to see this material given chronological treatment, given <em>Hits</em>' haphazard sequencing; Prince started out in a world of his own, but it was one quite different from the place he would occupy by the mid-80s.  Early tracks like ""I Wanna Be Your Lover"", ""Uptown"", and ""Controversy"" (anything calling itself <em>The Ultimate Prince</em> should have also included ""When You Were Mine"") were lean and economical, getting by with spare instrumentation and deliciously cheesy synths.  Then came the radical shift: When the opening hook of ""1999"" kicks in, you can almost feel the stagelights flaring and Prince's world flooding with color (mostly purple; some blue, magenta, and gold).  The first shot fired in Prince's ruthless assault on the 80s pop charts, the song also began one of the most creative and productive runs in popular music history: From ""1999"" until the end of the decade, you could count on Prince to make the radio a lot better a couple times a year.</p><p>
    Nearly all the big hits are included on <em>Ultimate Prince</em>, but one unusual decision is going to leave some listeners cold.  While the first disc is filled with radio edits of singles (an exception is the 8:40 album version of ""Purple Rain""), a number of significant additions are included only on the second disc in extended dance remix form.  So while ""Let's Go Crazy"", ""Pop Life, ""Kiss"", and others are present, none is shorter than six minutes, and ""Little Red Corvette"" alone runs well past eight.
    </p><p>
    It's an unusual strategy, but one that works for the most part.  Most of the remixes are by Prince himself, so the fact
    that ""Hot Thing"" and ""Raspberry Beret"", for example, are only available here in longer mixes doesn't diminish the set.  It <em>could</em> be an issue for someone new to Prince who hasn't already committed the songs to memory, but for someone like me, who hasn't pulled out the old vinyl in a while, hearing these familiar songs get some modest tweaking is enjoyable.  If the absence of ""When You Were Mine"" is the biggest complaint on Disc 1, worse is the lack of ""Erotic City"" on Disc 2: The seven-and-a-half minute-long classic would have been perfectly suited for the extended mixes disc, and indeed, seems like the best reason for such a collection to exist.
    </p>
<p>
    What most comes to mind while revisiting these tracks is how Prince conquered the world with such a singular vision.  His world of sex, love, sex, political commentary, and sex managed to seem universal, even as the person behind the music remained unknowable.  His music brought out the freakier side in everybody, and his erotic obsessions-- for as much heat as he once took for them-- now seem surprisingly healthy, predicated on mutual pleasure created by equals.  If I had a son and he was going to learn something about sex, he could do a lot worse than listening to Prince records.
    </p>
<p>
    James McNew of Yo La Tengo named his 2001 Dump album of home-recorded Prince covers <em>That Skinny Motherfucker With the High Voice?</em>.  The title was a reference to one of Prince's stranger 80s tracks, ""Bob George"" from <em>The Black Album</em>.  The line jumps out because it was, one imagines, the gut reaction of a certain segment of listeners who first encountered this strange man.  Rolling Stones fans who booed him offstage during his opening slot on the <em>Still Life</em> tour were booing ""that skinny motherfucker with the high voice"" (although they may have added ""in his bikini underwear and thigh-high stockings"").  But the amazing thing about Prince is that he eventually won these people over, and just about everyone else, too.  You'd never expect such a big-tent approach from a pop star this strange and mysterious.  Imagine anyone who cares about music being unable to find least one track in the Prince oeuvre to love.  He eventually reached almost everybody, and he did it by forcing us to see the world his way.

    On his first proper solo album, <em>To the Races, </em>Eric Bachmann continues the exploration of American folk music he initiated with Crooked Fingers. Stripped down to Bachmann's gravelly timbre accompanied by acoustic guitar, these 10 songs are restrained and unadorned, making this his most austere release. For most songwriters, boiling songs down to such spare arrangements is a risky move; there's no veneer of glossy production to hide behind. But Bachmann's elliptical picking patterns are always tasteful and his voice is rich and engaging enough to fill the space.</p><p>
    Opener ""Man O' War"", in which the narrator is ""caught up in a dangling sting off the shore,"" unfurls like a landscape at dawn. Calling to mind the density of vintage Bob Dylan lyrics, Bachmann layers image upon image in this sprawling song, set in Spain, which acts as a metaphor for displacement and loneliness. Augmented by Miranda Brown's delicate backing vocals and spacious, echoing piano accents, the naked arrangement of ""Man O' War"" charges the song with an affecting emotional honesty.</p><p>
    Where <em>To the Races</em> falters is when Bachmann lapses into the sort of posturing that plagues many singer-songwriters. Like Dylan or, particularly on the hoarsely whispered ""Home"", Bruce Springsteen, Bachmann can adopt a detached and knowing persona, weathered by experience and weary of the world. When, in ""Carrboro Woman"", Bachmann sings, ""I came upon a wounded beast/ She was laying in the sand/ Her heart held in her hand,"" he exudes all the self-importance and arrogance of Leonard Cohen, but lacks the same poetic elegance to pull it off.
    </p>
<p>
    In spite of its flaws, <em>To the Races</em> charms with its somber atmosphere. Evenly paced and modestly scaled, the album sustains a mood that effectively supports Bachmann's vulnerable material. And by limiting outside influence to Brown's gorgeous backing vocals and Tom Hagerman's violin contributions-- most notably on the jaunty title track-- the album has a hermetic feel, recalling other intimate statements such as Cat Power's haunting <em>Covers Record</em> or Kristin Hersh's elegiac <em>The Grotto</em>. And although <em>To the Races</em> isn't as affecting as either of those projects, it's an admirably understated record that reveals yet another side of Bachmann's prolific career.

    There are a number of reasons why <em>Rogue's
    Gallery</em> shouldn't have
    worked. As the subtitle helpfully states, this a collection of old ""pirate ballads, sea songs and chanteys""
    recorded by the motliest of crews, artists ranging from indie (Akron/Family) to
    auspicious (Sting, Bono), from predictable (Nick
    Cave) to surprising (cartoonist
    Ralph Steadman). Furthermore, it is a hush-hush tie-in (albeit not a soundtrack)
    to <em>Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's
    Chest</em>-- director Gore Verbinski and 
    Johnny Depp originated the project, and their involvement no doubt gives it
    a boost. The collection gives the immediate impression that it wants to do for
    pirates and chanteys what<em> O Brother, Where
    Art Thou</em>? did for yokels and Appalachian music.</p><p>
    But top billing on that Odd Nerdrum-goes-Hollywood cover art
    goes to producer Hal Willner, perhaps best known for 1989's Disney tribute<em> Stay Awake</em>, a true gem in the otherwise
    lackluster Various Artists file. For Willner, <em>Rogue's Gallery</em> seems as much a research project as a commercial
    venture: He reportedly compiled a library of more than 600 tunes from which to
    whittle a tracklist. The pairings of singer and song make for some great
    moments and disasters alike, but Willner allows the musicians to be as maudlin
    or as bawdy as they want. Those accustomed to the Decemberists' modern maritime
    re-creations will hear very few smirks or winks on these 43 tracks. (That said,
    Meloy is conspicuously absent from this collection, despite having re-introduced the
    maritime ballad into the indie lexicon with compositions like ""Shanty for Arethusa""
    and ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"".)</p><p>
    Despite its connection to this summer's all-ages blockbuster,
    <em>Rogue's Gallery</em> is definitely rated
    Arrrrrrrr (sorry). Parents whose kids loved the adventures of Cap'n Jack Sparrow will
    want to keep the l'il buggers out of earshot of Nick
    Cave's reading of ""Fire Down
    Below"", which assigns many meanings to that three-word phrase, from the
    nautical to the spiritual to the sexual. But Cave's work here is schoolboy stuff compared to Gavin Friday. In his take
    on the gleefully pornographic ""Baltimore Whores"", Friday describes...my mom reads this site sometimes. And you'll just have
    to guess as to what Loudon Wainwright III rhymes with ""Good Ship Venus"", a song
    that seems designed purely to make a sailor blush. His take, however, is more
    than just a ribald recounting of sexual antics at sea; Wainwright seems to be
    having more fun here than anyone else.
    </p>
<p>
    Instead of ribald humor, Joseph Arthur goes for inspired
    silliness on ""Coast of High Barbary"", abandoning his typically brooding vocals
    for an uncharacteristically exaggerated and almost unrecognizable tenor, and
    stunt-guitar-player and throat-singer Baby Gramps shapes his voice into a
    digeridoo on the seven-minute opener, ""Cape Cod Girls"". Actor John C. Reilly
    acquits himself very nicely on two tracks, the staggeringly dignified drinking
    song ""Fathom the Bowl"" the better of the two, and Ralph Steadman (you know him
    as Hunter S. Thompson's visual collaborator) may hardly be the very model of a
    modern major label crooner on closer ""Little Boy Billy"", but he relishes each
    roll of consonants and relates his tale of attempted cannibalism like's he
    playing parlor games. On the other hand, when musicians try for the overly
    dramatic, as on Jarvis Cocker's ""A Drop of Nelson's Blood"" or Bono's
    excruciating ""A Dying Sailor to His Shipmates"" (Worst. Eulogy. Ever.), the results
    are stultifying.
    </p>
<p>
    Not everyone works blue (Eliza Carthy drops the word ""ass""
    from ""Rolling Sea"",
    a curiously squeamish omission), nor does every song on <em>Rogue's Gallery</em> demand a hoisted stein, a cheery sing-along, or a
    theatrical flourish. In fact, many songs muster 
    startling gravity from bare voices. Lucinda Williams infuses ""Bonnie
    Portmore"" with a cracked solemnity, communicating the sadness of seeing a
    beautiful ship consigned to the scrapyard. But the droney keyboard behind her
    adds a superfluously cinematic backdrop that actively detracts from her
    performance. Mary Margaret O'Hara fares better on ""The Cry of Man"", her voice
    swelling and falling beautifully and unpredictably as if mimicking the motion
    of the sea, and Bryan Ferry's gruff sailor's voice joins in a call-and-response
    with Antony's otherworldly siren on ""Lowlands Low"", the contrast between them generating
    a peculiar drama of its own. In comparison, Andrea Corr's barely a cappella
    reading of ""Caroline and Her Young Sailor Bold"" sounds waterlogged; think
    Kristy McNichol in <em>The Pirate Movie</em>
    instead of Keira Knightley.<em></em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Rogue's Gallery</em> is
    almost by definition scattershot, alternating between discoveries and
    atrocities, crests and troughs. However, like<em> Stay Awake</em>, it is an immersive experience: Willner's attention to
    historical detail and his artists' derring-do absorb you fully into the world
    of these songs, without becoming dry or daunting. First and foremost these
    songs are entertainments, but taken together, they offer a useful corrective to
    the swashbuckling of the film, trading in the dark desires and darker doings of
    desperate seamen.

    If the Village Green's name conjures the Kinks' landmark album of pastoral pining and nostalgia, it's no coincidence. No, the Village Green don't traffic in Ray Davies-style social critique or British parlor music. But the Portland, Oregon-based band is a preservation society of sorts, practicing a kind of genre slumming that sees the band veer from bluesy boogie one minute to skankin' guitar the next. But like so many contemporary bands dedicated to digging up the past, the Village Green never really forge a sound of their own or rise above a mix and match of styles. Instead, they play it safe, sticking close to well-charted classic rock territory.</p><p>
    Opener ""Om: The Meaning of Life"" is one of <em>Feeling the Fall</em>'s best-- and least typical-- songs, a slow-builder that forks and splits without losing its way. Calling to mind a less quirky version of Olivia Tremor Control, the band packs abrupt shifts and unexpected transitions into its version of smooth 1960s pop. Over folky acoustic strums and a snaking electric guitar line, singer J. Nicholas Allard layers syrupy oohs until drums steer the song into its transitional middle section. After the multi-part passage culminates in a false ending, the song takes a bouncy detour. And before the song shifts a final time to revisit its first section in double time, Allard spouts some vintage hippie drivel about ""living in the institution"" and inevitably rhymes ""revolution"" with ""evolution."" In other words, even the lyrics languish in well-worn pop models.</p><p>
    While ""Om"" uses a less predictable structure to resist classic rock trappings, the rest of the album seldom succeeds on this level. Following ""Om"", the Village Green open ""When the Creepers Creep In"" with jumpy upstrokes and a growling bass line. Over these ska elements, the band adds fuzzed-out garage rock guitars and a hackneyed chorus in which Allard inexplicably sings, ""I saw you late last night/ Sleepin' by my side/ There ain't no room to run when the creepers creep in."" Caveman rock poetry aside, the Village Green's songs never make for unpleasant listening. But there's something so familiar about them that they sound utterly unexciting. From the sprightly ""Country Road"" to the epic sprawl of ""Rosa Glynn"", <em>Feeling the Fall</em> is full of melody. Still, without any risks or surprises or even emotional crescendos, the album remains unapologetically conventional.
    </p>
<p>
    With each passing year, originality is allegedly inching closer to extinction. But entering the rock dialogue five decades in shouldn't result in such rote parroting. If anything, the music that's come before gives bands a foundation to build on-- if not flat-out demolish. The Village Green, though, seem more interested in fortifying rock music's bedrock with <em>Feeling the Fall</em>, as if it actually needed to be guarded from collapse.

    Many adventures begin in the familiar and end in the unknown, but Dave Pajo's is more Odyssean in character-- picking up in the musical map's far-flung regions, his voyage has been a circuitous quest to reattain the familiarity of hearth and home. With Slint, he helped to invent the stark, dissonant style of post-rock that was rampant in the Midwestern 1990s underground; he spent a time coolly noodling in Stereolab; left a thumbprint in Tortoise's apocalyptic jazz; crafted minimal and lucid math-rock as M and Aerial M; survived Zwan. After the turn of the millennium, on <em>Papa M Sings</em>, <em>Whatever, Mortal</em>, and his self-titled 2005 LP, Pajo quite literally found his voice, and his glittering instrumental/electronics became backdrops for pensive, traditionally inclined folk songs instead of ends unto themselves.</p><p>
    So if <em>1968</em> feels like a milestone in Pajo's career, it's not because of any quantum leap in his songwriting-- he's sturdy and deliberate as ever-- but because it feels like a hard-won denouement. With its emphasis on traditional craft and instrumentation instead of brooding experimentation, <em>1968</em> finds Pajo fully inhabiting the rootsy folk-rock he's been warily circling for years. His songwriting aesthetic comes into sharp focus-- Pajo coaxes out serene, overcast melodies from music that's as ineffably weird as it is unostentatious, maximizing the subtleties of his utilitarian voice to wring every available drop of aphoristic intrigue from his meditations on spirituality, folkloric revisions, and sinister love songs.</p><p>
    Pajo has a long track record of releasing good albums that don't have any one mind-blowing song, working instead as impressionistic totalities. <em>1968</em> bucks that trend, and any discussion of it<em> </em>has to start with ""Who's That Knocking"", which sets the bar impossibly high for its consistently fine yet pale-by-comparison remainder and has two things that Pajo's dreamy washes usually lack-- an instantly memorable melody and subtle yet devastating dynamic shifts. Beginning at an ominous acoustic slither, it deftly pivots into a glassy lilt decorated with silvery tracers of electric guitar, and then effervesces into an airborne chorus, cycling seamlessly through these three modes for almost six minutes. Lyrically and vocally, Pajo rises to the occasion, engaging himself in a gnomic interlocution seething with gothic anxiety. His lyrics here bear traces of his time in Will Oldham's band, with their circumspect intimations about death, deals with the devil, and oedipal angst. 
    </p>
<p>
    The rest of the album plays out Pajo's typical restraint, although it has more pep than anything he's heretofore produced as a solo artist. ""Foolish King"" finds him introspecting about the infinite subjectivity of personal morality over a winsome, ringing guitar lead: ""Am I sinner or saint, oh, which one will I be?/ Only I may know this useless mystery."" We get eerie flashes of specificity-- on the crunchy, spark-throwing rocker ""We Get Along, Mostly"", a cancer reference balloons up like a dark cloud in the summer-sky melody. This sort of razor-in-apple juxtaposition-- serene melodies with dark apparitions drifting at their peripheries-- is <em>1968</em>'s dominant trope. On the idyllic ""Cyclone Eyes"", for instance, you have to listen closely to realize Pajo's singing about locking someone in a basement with a gun to his head. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's the sort of stuff that Xiu Xiu would dress in squalling tones more obviously suited to its content. Pajo favors the soft-sell, so that his poisoned valentines stay with you for even longer than it takes for them to psychically resolve, a little at a time, into the fullness of their horror and awe. If this is his spiritual homecoming, it reminds us that while home is where the heart is, the heart is filled with things much squirmier and harder to quantify than the sense of complacent well-being with which the maxim is associated.

    The sacred and the profane make such exquisite bedfellows.
    Gospel and funk, presumably, represent each one respectively, somewhere on the
    musical continuum. Gospel is evangelical, righteous, calling people to the
    cause, while funk is...well now wait a second. Funk is righteous, too, and
    what's James Brown doing when he takes it to the bridge if not evangelizing,
    calling people to the cause? Funk is a feel as much as anything-- you can do
    what you please with that feel, and the groups on this comp turn the groove
    into a soul train to God's Kingdom.</p><p>
    Anyway, nothing brings out the fire in the soul quite like
    the fire down below, so whatever's going on here, it smokes and wails and
    sounds like Hell giving it up for Heaven. The Numero guys built this comp from
    scraps of religiously tinged funk found scattered across B-sides, more
    traditional gospel albums, and gospel label catalogues-they're funky aberrations
    from a more generally staid realm, and they're all so raw that I'm not even
    sure it's possible to get these sounds anymore with modern equipment. If you're
    a militant secularist worried about getting Jesus on your shirt or whatever,
    stop it. These songs are plenty righteous, but they're not preachy, and it's so
    easy to lose yourself in the grooves and the atmosphere that they might as well
    be singing about the separation of church and state for all it matters to your
    shaking hips and slipping backbone.</p><p>
    Religious though they are, a few of the groups here seem
    to have forgotten one commandment: Thou shalt not steal. The Modulations' ""This
    Old World Is Going Down"" cribs directly from the Temptations' ""Shakey Ground""
    for its chorus, the Universal Jubileers' ""Childhood Days"" rather appropriately
    nicks from Al Green's ""Love and Happiness"", and on ""I Thank the Lord"",
    the Mighty Voices of Wonder snatch their chorus from ""I
    Thank You"", a hit for both Sam &amp; Dave and ZZ Top. Oh, but what's a little plagiarism when the funk is as heavy as the 5 Spiritual Tones' ""Bad Situation"" or the
    Mighty Walker Brothers (no relation to the other Walker Brothers), who bring their message of salvation on a swinging bass line and tick-ticking hi-hat that makes me
    picture a sweaty disco more than a crowded revival tent.
    </p>
<p>
    The Mighty Walkers recorded their contribution to this set
    in 1980, but it sounds more like 1968. These recordings didn't usually spring
    from big-budget sessions, and the sheer screaming rawness of the music is
    definitely an asset. These beats don't need sheen to kill (or save), and the
    vocal testifying just works better competing with the ride cymbal for your
    ears. The most stunning track sounds like it was recorded with one, maybe two
    microphones. Voices of Conquest were a church choir with a secret weapon:
    Benjamin Wilson's drum kit. It's just the voices and him, slamming away with Keith
    Moon-ish ferocity; record the guy by himself for 10 minutes and a thousand DJs
    could eat for a year sneaking his breaks into their sets. As basic as it is, it
    still sounds way out there, and the effect of that wall of drum colliding with
    that wall of voice is overwhelming.
    </p>
<p>
    Other oddities include Sam Taylor's funk overhaul of Webber
    &amp; Rice's ""Heaven on Their Minds"", and a second musical theater track,
    LaVice &amp; Company's ""Thoughs Were the Days"" (sic), which features a bizarre
    lead vocal that sounds more like a caricature of a preacher than actual
    preaching remembering when ""Hell was a swinging place."" These songs illustrate
    the gray areas this comp operates in well: Neither is intended as actual
    gospel, but they fit the funky religion theme. And if it wasn't for the God
    thing, this would be just a regular old comp of whomping, phenomenal funk obscurities.
    Hell, a few songs, like the Triumphs' ""We Don't Love Enough"", have a pretty
    universal message and are hardly more pious than the average Bobby Bland or Aretha
    Franklin track from the same era.
    </p>
<p>
    So we're back to that tangled place on the continuum, where
    we find that extricating two genres with such similar roots from each other is
    nearly impossible. Ultimately, the story of this comp is about gospel
    artists embracing the funk, however temporarily, and the little, hard-working
    labels that made these records possible. The 45 labels in the typically lavish
    booklet sport everything from crosses-on-Calvary overkill to austere type-only
    simplicity (my favorite label logo is One-Way's,
    which shows an arrow, pointing up), illustrating the widely varied funding levels
    available to the people involved. Best of all, though, this represents the
    culmination of years of devoted crate-digging, so baggage aside, every track is
    excellent, and the selection doesn't bother with anything sub-standard. That
    makes for one solid disc full of music rescued from the brink of being
    forgotten. Praise someone for that.

    As early hardcore schtick, Code of Honor's central conceit-- an actual, 11-part honor code-- ranks somewhere below 7 Seconds' eye-black and batting gloves stage-wear, and a little above Minor Threat's X-ed up hands.  Totally ridiculous, but explicable: Eighties hardcore, famous for being Neanderthal music (see: Youth of Today), was still remarkably conceptual-- ridiculous, goofy, but nevertheless thought through.  So there's really no good way to contextualize, or even describe, the weirdness of the rebirth of bands like Code of Honor into the contemporary, and wildly inhospitable, review cycle.  Where today's bands generally have their context handed to them-- all things being equal on the internet or in the digital download store-- Code of Honor are a relic of a different time when bands fought fiercely merely to explain what the fuck they were.  Hence the honor code.</p><p>
    Code of Honor guitarist Michael Fox was, then and now, a linchpin of the San Francisco punk scene.  Co-founder of Subterranean Records, the label that released Flipper onto the world (plus the seminal <em>SF Underground</em><em> </em>7"" comp), Fox was a <em>Maximumrocknroll</em> darling who played in a series of respected Bay Area bands: Tools, Sick Pleasure, and eventually, Code of Honor.  In California, Black Flag, Bad Religion, and the Adolescents already had records out; in their native San Francisco, Code of Honor were immediately and consistently eclipsed by the Dead Kennedys. In the east, Minor Threat and Bad Brains ruled; in the Midwest, it was Hüsker Dü and Die Kreuzen.  Like Articles of Faith, Chicago's proto-emo thrash band of that era, Code of Honor were known by many but only loved by a very few. Even Code of Honor's label was better known for issuing records from the San Fran ""freak scene,"" including what Simon Reynolds called ""the San Francisco counterpart to <em>No New York</em>,"" the live comp <em>Live at Target</em>.</p><p>
    Articles of Faith, a similarly marginal band, embarked on a reissue campaign in the 1990s and when the recordings resurfaced, they were a shock.  Here was a band, it turned out, that had been obviously worshipped by acts as diverse as Born Against and Rites of Spring, presaging a far thrashier hardcore even as they laid down a bunch of the groundwork for emo as an eventual genre.  Code of Honor, graced with the re-release of their <em>Complete Studio Recordings: 1982-1984</em>, turn out to have no such surprises in store.
    </p>
<p>
    They were an average era group. They showed flashes of Minutemen funk (""What Are We Gonna Do??"") and flirted with the type of melodic hardcore that Dag Nasty and others would later perfect (""Attempted Control"").  ""Beware the Savage Jaw"" is a better 7 Seconds than 7 Seconds ever managed.  But their songs are less visionary than completely of their time.
    </p>
<p>
    As gentle reprimand, then, to today's largely apolitical music world, the decision by Subterranean to release Code of Honor's <em>Complete Studio Recordings</em> makes a lot more sense.  Having had their entire context demolished-- when these recordings were originally released, the band was part of a popular and widespread first wave hardcore movement that loved speed and loathed Reagan in equal measure, and made song after song about it-- they're not wrong to remind people they once existed.  This a band, after all, that wrote the following in <em>1982</em>: ""The destruction of peace in the Far and Middle East/ They playing their game/ We all know what it's for/ Their eyes are money/ They're planning for war.""
    </p>
<p>
    Code of Honor were inspiring, though, for the same reason that it's almost impossible to get through <em>Complete Studio Recordings</em> in one sitting: a relentless, monotonous, note of a protest.  You don't have to miss four chord thrash and atonal yelling to wonder why it's so difficult for another act, any act, to say something as simple as ""Kill your leaders/ They all must go/ Like Ronald Reagan's fascist soul/ They're like a plague that never ends/ They create death/ They're not our friends...Fight or die!""

    The way ?uestlove keeps telling it, that initial meeting
    with new boss Jay-Z sounds like a fully-hocked saliva rocket in the eye of every asshole who
    tried to force the Roots to compromise their status as studied hip-hop altar
    boys in pursuit of the bottom line. Like the tough-ass principal with a heart
    of platinum, it seems Mr. Def Jam was full of charity, spewing
    quotables like, ""Don't come to me playing a whole bunch of Clear Channel
    songs thinking I'm gonna be cool with it,"" and, my personal favorite,
    ""If y'all come here with snap music, I'm snapping y'all the fuck out of my
    audience.""</p><p>
    So the Roots were sent off to make a Roots album...you know, that
    ""artsy shit."" For a band known for the occasional indulgence (the $300,000+ price tag to complete <em>Phrenology</em>'s
    horrendously overwrought ""Break You Off"", a concert mentality that equates
    excruciating length with awesomeness), such a mandate could have birthed a
    freewheeling disaster tipsy on its own pretensions. Miraculously, art-hop's
    highest get concise on <em>Game Theory</em>-- cutting song lengths,
    spoken-word tedium, and call-and-response nonsense. Fourteen years deep, the Roots avoid the wild sonic
    tangents of yesteryear, zeroing in on a svelte, safe, and solid
    take on what we've come to expect from a Roots record.</p><p>
    Light years away from the jazzy bap of their early days, the Roots continue to embrace their band-dom and musical acumen here, with studio guru ?uestlove
    tweaking with purpose; unlike the sometimes directionless experimentation of
    <em>Phrenology</em> and the preternatural smoothness of <em>The Tipping Point</em>, each sonic
    decision sounds measured and precise yet still alive and heaving. Beat-wise, the
    bounding throb at the center of ""Here I Come"" pumps hardest, with
    key-man Kamal striking futuristic synths while ?uest lays down an unrelenting
    boom that's rewarded with a fizzy solo outro. Wet drums return on doom-y
    ""In the Music"", adding grit alongside a horror movie bassline
    and simmering guitar-- clearly (and thankfully), Scott Storch is nowhere to be found. 
    </p>
<p>
    Pop music writer Chuck Eddy once described Bruce Springsteen as someone whose
    ""muse can't be separated from his ego; he's too palpably concerned with
    how he'll be documented in the history books"" and the same can be said
    about the Roots. They sometimes mistake experimentation with progress while preaching holier-than-thouisms to the choir. Both ""Take It There"", with its over the top piano
    melodrama and the listless ""Livin' in a New World"" falter, relying
    too heavily on questionable texture and knob tricks. Tellingly, though, they are also
    two of the album's shortest tracks. Whereas such noble risks were once epic, they're now
    miniaturized-- the Roots have learned from their mistakes. More than ever, the
    band uses its know-how skillfully, as on the stunning title track, which beefs up Sly
    Stone's early 1960s song ""Life of Fortune &amp; Fame"". On the original,
    Stone all but predicts the paranoia and doubt he'd perfect with 1971's <em>There's a Riot Goin' On</em>. That album's claustrophobic murk is felt
    throughout <em>Game Theory</em>, and its musical moodiness is echoed by Black Thought,
    who unpeels himself ever so slightly while charging hard with anger and
    desperation. 
    </p>
<p>
    There's been much debate about Thought recently, spurred
    by recent critical drubbings deeming him dull and uncharismatic. Even ?uestlove
    chimed in on the
    Okayplayer message boards, dismissing the hate as a mere ""trend."" Such rationalizations can't hide the monotonous nonchalance of Thought's natural delivery or his often second-rate bread-and-butter battle rhymes. Though technically proficient, his passivity is
    the Roots' most noticeable handicap. <em>Game Theory</em> partially solves this problem
    with a healthy dose of guest shots from old friends Malik B (making a strong
    return as a non-member after being booted for drug dependence about six years
    ago) and Dice Raw, along with welcomed mixtape all-star and Philly native
    Peedi Peedi (aka Peedi Crakk) and newcomer Porn. 
    </p>
<p>
    All four are gifted with lively styles that juxtapose nicely
    with Thought's steady cadence. The two best vocal performances on the
    disc come courtesy of Dice, who annihilates ""Here I Come"" with a
    one-eye-open, nervy confessional, and Peedi, who shows off an uncharacteristically
    tender touch on the warm Illadeph ode ""Long Time"". Although he gets the dubious distinction of Least Googleable Rapper,
    Porn haunts with his unique sing/cry style on the hook for ""In the
    Music"". Indicative of the LP's troubleshooting nature, Thought is wisely relieved from most of the album's hooks, and he trades in his half-huff boasts for pinpoint post-Katrina polemics that deride Bush, the creaky state of American democracy and the urban drug trap as he plays modern black editorialist. 
    </p>
<p>
    The Public Enemy-inflected ""False Media"" finds him
    voicing Dubya as a multitasking evil empire unto himself (""Send our
    troops to get my paper/ Tell 'em stay away from them skyscrapers"") and it
    does an excellent job of summarizing five years of fear-heightening boogey-man
    hunting into a few tidy lines. ""Baby"", a loose, Jay Dee-esque
    highlight that serves as a superior sonic tribute to the late producer than the
    album's well-intentioned but sappy Dilla shout ""Can't Stop
    This"", has Thought sing-songing through hallucinatory tales of rape and
    lust-- it's the pitch-black flip to ""You Got Me"". The MC's anxious musings become overbearing and repetitive by the album's end, but his bravura
    bursts on ""Long Time"", where he tempers his dread with home-grown
    hope, and especially the convoluted drug-feud terror of ""Clock With No
    Hands"", show that getting past his aesthetic pitfalls is a worthy pursuit. 
    </p>
<p>
    When I interviewed ?uestlove earlier this year about the
    progress of <em>Game Theory</em>, he admitted that ""it's a challenge to not over
    think"" his band's work. Of course, the album is over
    thought-- it is a Roots album after all, and superfluous embellishments along
    with high-concept artwork and sequence second-guessing are part of the
    excitement. But now, the excess brainpower is mostly used to cover-up past blemishes
    en route to a streamlined product that die-hards can justly revel in. President Carter
    should be proud.

    Snowglobe was at one point a normal, cohesive rock band. But
    it seems that on <em>Oxytocin</em>, the band's third album, it's become more of a
    collective helmed by Brad Postlethwaite-- there's a message in the artwork
    claiming that this is the first in a series on ""solo-directed projects by
    the members of Snowglobe."" The sound is still huge, layered like a Bryce
    Canyon cliff face. It's the kind of music that strokes the nerve that makes
    critics and P.R. people compare anything with a musical saw to Neutral Milk
    Hotel, and the comparison holds to a point. The instruments are densely piled
    on-- and yes, there is a saw-- but Postlethwaite's songwriting aims for
    something less impressionistic. There's more of a sense of communal
    music-making, rather than a feeling of being trapped in someone's
    free-associating head.</p><p>
    Big vocal harmonies figure prominently across the album, and I mean big.
    Postlethwaite and a couple of backup singers layer their voices into freakily
    homogenous choirs. It plays well into the overall aesthetic, and the melody is
    never lost in the complex arrangements and exceedingly dry production. The best
    vocal arrangement comes on ""December Ghost"", a pensive song built on
    a series of patterns that jump from one instrument to another, beginning on
    acoustic guitar and ending on the violin. The harmonies waft in and out, and at
    times the backing voices separate from one another to sing brief melodic
    phrases.<br/></p><p>
    ""At Times a Nightmare"" is a slow, country-inflected song that
    suddenly lurches skyward after three minutes into a second movement-- it's far
    too substantial to think of as a coda-- and after the vocal portion there's a
    minute of flat-out wailing on analog synthesizers. It's the most cathartic song
    on an otherwise even-keeled album, and the lyric ""Never wanted this to
    end/ Sunday morning it was back to the mourning/ It was back into the pain
    again"" is among Postlethwaite's best.
    </p>
    Little instrumental interludes are sprinkled across the album, and rather
    surprisingly, they offer some of the most appealing moments. ""Intro to
    Dry"", um, introduces ""Dry"" with a bit of broken-backed trumpet,
    ""Cellos"" is a dramatic, charging instrumental that builds from a
    quiet cello ostinato to a roaring pile of instrumentals and then breaks back
    down to just a bass line in less than two minutes, and ""Piano"" is a
    brief stab of melancholy before the floating ""Caroline"", which is
    like the Radar Brothers with less stationary inertia.
    <p class=""MsoNormal"">
<em>Oxytocin</em> is full of little surprises and details that reward repeat
    listens, but very few of the decorations seem merely tacked on. As full as it is, there are certain moments on the album where it oddly lacks atmosphere, perhaps
    a side effect of the saturated production. That's a small complaint, though, and <em>Oxytocin</em> is  a resounding success that makes me wonder
    what else is on tap in this solo-directed Snowglobe series.

    And number one on the list of phrases we'd never expect to
    see in the liner notes of a New York Dolls album: ""String samples courtesy
    of Vienna Symphonic Library."" But its appearance in the fine print on <em>One
    Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This</em> is only slightly less surprising
    than the existence of the album itself. Even after the glam-punk pioneers'
    triumphant, Morrissey-goaded reunion performance at London's Meltdown festival in
    June 2004, the concept of a new New York Dolls album seemed unfathomable, given
    that their star guitarist Johnny Thunders had been dead for 13 years and
    drummers Jerry Nolan and Billy Murcia had checked out long before that; with
    the sudden, leukemia-related death of bassist Arthur Kane coming just weeks
    after the reunion gig, the surviving Dolls were barely holding on to their
    plural status. But if there are only two original Dolls still alive to make a
    new record, they may as well be the ones who wrote all the songs (guitarist
    Sylvain Sylvain) and the one whose voice gave them personality (David
    Johansen). No strangers to prescient album titles (see 1974's career-killing
    <em>Too Much Too Soon</em>), with <em>One Day</em>, the Dolls
    play with a humble restraint that suggests they're just grateful to be here.</p><p>
    While the Dolls' songwriting was always
    smart enough to transcend their image, the initial shock
    of the latter is what ultimately secures their place in the pre-punk canon. Beyond
    their gender-bending veneer-- more of a theatrical device than a political
    one-- the Dolls' intent was regressive rather than progressive, shamelessly
    asserting their love of antiquated forms like rockabilly and doo-wop in a
    post-hippie era preoccupied with 20-minute guitar solos and multi-sectional
    prog suites. Though an essential text for the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and
    Ramones, the Dolls' self-titled debut is really no more threatening than 1972's
    other ragged rock'n'roll masterwork, <em>Exile on Main Street</em>. So it follows then that <em>One Day</em> sounds less like the work of punk provocateurs than a Keith Richards
    solo album: grizzled rock vets backed by a nominally gritty if
    too-well-rehearsed troupe of young(er) hired guns (guitarist Steve Conte,
    bassist Sami Yaffa, keyboardist Brian Koonin, and drummer Brian Delaney). In a
    sense, the Dolls personify the changes their hometown has undergone in the past
    three decades; the streets still bustle with tension and excitement, but the
    fear of getting mugged has subsided considerably.</p><p>
    One thing working in the new New York Dolls'
    favor is that the band's most enduring songs (""Personality Crisis"",
    ""Trash"") weren't confined to the typical preoccupations of young men
    looking to get laid. So where Mick Jagger still tries to play the sympathetic
    devil, Johansen is happy playing the sentimental fool. His voice has ripened
    considerably over the years-- evidence of his years belting out blues standards
    with his band the Harry Smiths-- but as charismatic a frontman Johansen
    remains, much of the new repertoire never rises far above sub-Stones pub-rock
    (""Runnin' Around"", ""Take a Good Look at My Good Looks"") or
    self-tribute (""Dance Like a Monkey"" revives both the ""ooh
    ooh"" harmonies from ""Trash"" and the safari rumble of
    ""Stranded in the Jungle"").
    </p>
<p>
    Aside from the spirited soda-shop strut of
    ""Rainbow Store"", it's actually the bittersweet ballads that fare
    best: the Tom Waitsian stroll of ""Maimed Happiness"" and the
    Springsteen-sized climax ""Dancing on the Lip of the Volcano"" (featuring
    effective backing vocals from Michael Stipe) both bear evidence of the wounded
    blue-eyed soul that always lurked behind the Dolls' mascara'd lashes. But more
    importantly, they're genuine displays of vulnerability from former bad boys who
    are wise enough to know you can't put your arms around a memory.

The meaning of ""post-war"" changes depending on whether or not
    your side won. The term is likely to keep its basically positive connotation
    in the U.S. at least until everyone who remembers the late-1940s is dead.
    I'm unsure what war M. Ward is referring to in the title of his fifth album,
    or even if he had a specific war in mind, but a time of active war seems
    like an odd time to consider the sentiment. The reality of human nature also
    means that every post-war is also a pre-war-- every generation spills blood
    sooner or later.</p><p>
    The title track sheds a bit of light on where Ward's mind is, and that's to
    say he's right about where he usually is. Ward's post-war is internal,
    relational; it's adjusting to new realities, both pleasant and not. Backed
    with electric piano and shaker-- a sort of slow-motion r&amp;b setting-- Ward's
    endearingly creaky tenor softly draws the line between then and now: ""You
    say the money just ain't what it used to be/ Man how we used to tear apart
    this town/ Put a dollar into the machine and you'll remember how."" The
    humidity is so high in the arrangement that I swear my speakers got wet.</p><p>
    That humidity comes and goes on <em>Post-War</em>, Ward's first record with a
    full-time backing band. Having the band doesn't
    fundamentally change his approach, but it does boost the immediacy of
    some of his songs. The overall flow of the album is also much more focused
    than in the past, with 12 songs and very few transitional scraps and
    mood pieces. If those little bits of ephemera carried a large part of the
    charm load on his earlier albums, they're not missed very sorely
    here-- beautifully realized songs and great musicianship have a way of making
    up for something like that.
    </p><p>
    And these are some truly beautiful songs. Live strings spar with mellotron
    strings on ""Poison Cup"", a gorgeous and intense love song that begins, ""One
    or two won't do/ 'Cause I want it all...I hope you know what I'm thinkin'
    of/ I want all of your love."" The song leaves Ward's familiar intimacy behind
    for timpanis and grandeur, but he doesn't shed a drop of emotion in the
    transition. ""Requiem"" storms in with raw blues picking, and from there
    twists Ward's most-visited theme-- loss-- into an unusually triumphant tribute
    to a man who ""stormed with his feet and clapped with his hands/ (And)
    summoned all of his joy when he laughed.""  ""In war he was a tiger/ And in
    peace he was a dove"" is just one of the dualities Ward gives his character
    in the kind of obituary anyone would love to have written about him.
    </p>
<p>
    Ward nearly equals the shear majesty of My Morning Jacket's ""Golden"" on
    ""Chinese Translation"", which features MMJ's Jim James on backing vocals. The
    song's ""what do you do with the pieces of a broken heart"" refrain and
    acoustic/electric guitar duel hit home like hammers. The cover of Daniel
    Johnston's ""To Go Home"", with Neko Case handling the harmonies, is amazing,
    musically reminiscent of Wilco at their <em>Summerteeth</em>/<em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> peak. Not everything
    is so substantial. ""Magic Trick"" is essentially a quick joke about a girl
    whose only trick is disappearing, while ""Neptune's Net"" is a fun but
    inconsequential surf instrumental (strangely, it doesn't sound out of
    place).
    </p>
<p>
    Changing his approach has rewarded M. Ward pretty handsomely on <em>Post-War</em>.
    <em>The Transfiguration of Vincent</em> is still my favorite Ward album by a
    hair, but this one
    isn't going far from my player for long. <em>Post-War</em> isn't perfect, but it's
    all the more listenable for that fact.

<em>Kelis Was Here</em> is a study in contradictions and a difficult nut to crack, an album whose appeals seem straightforward and yet are curiously hard to pin down. Having abandoned the Neptunes entirely in favour of a revolving cast of collaborators (Scott Storch, Will.I.Am, Shondrae, Raphael Saadiq), the r&amp;b singer who proudly describes herself as “the first girl to scream on a track” rifles through a myriad of styles over the course of 70 minutes, haphazardly throwing everything at the wall, 1990s Prince album style. It's simultaneously exhaustive and exhausting: A struggle to digest in one sitting, but curiously accommodating to repeat listening. 
    In this, the record is reminiscent of Kelis's 2001 album, <em>Wanderland</em>, which was so devoid of obvious hits it wasn't even released in the U.S.</p><p>
    Also like <em>Wanderland</em>, Kelis's latest album is formally varied but feels consistent-- even monochrome in parts. She remains indebted to the Neptunes' production nous even in their absence, regularly adorning herself with the sort of production touches one would expect from the duo. But where the Neptunes gave Kelis consistency by always drawing attention to their own unmistakable sound, this album's consistency is a direct result of its coolly competent eclecticism, with both Kelis and her producers trying to fade, chameleon-like, into the fabric of the songs. 
    With the oddball charisma toned down and the lens zooming in on Kelis' melisma-adverse vocals, one is left with the sense that all of these songs could be bigger and more distinct, but it's hard to pinpoint how exactly. This drawback is also ultimately the album's draw: Given time to settle in, many of these songs are among Kelis's most charming, ingratiating themselves with surprising ease.</p><p>
    It seems strange to say that this album feels understated, as Kelis is going in more directions than ever before, and pushing herself harder in the process: It's impossible to reconcile the grill fetishism and rudimentary beats of first single and opener “Bossy” with the extended Spanish guitar jam of closer “Have a Nice Day”. We witness the singer at her most deliberately generic (the grinding club banger “What's That Right There”) and her most perversely far out (the breezy nu-jazz and flower-child rapping of “Circus”, which oddly reminds me of 4 Hero and Ursula Rucker's “Time”); her most brazenly confronting (the urgent and almost crude “Blindfold Me”) and her most winsomely sentimental (the Southern fried motivational anthem “Lil' Star”).
    </p>
<p>
    Indeed, Kelis frequently seems hellbent on sounding like anyone but herself: The shouty glam shuffle of “I Don't Think So” could be a lost Rachel Stevens single, while the spare quasi-dancehall thud and heavy petting raps of “Aw S***!” owes more than a bit to Missy Elliott. Content to play dress-ups, Kelis alternates between her usual throaty, multi-tracked hum hovering around about five notes, and whatever vocal style she thinks will fit the mood. It's the moments when Kelis slips back into herself that give this album not only an air of comforting familiarity but all of its most magical moments: Kelis who sounds both astonished and drained on the airy love song “Living Proof”; Kelis who tries to be menacing but just sounds goofy when she promises “Keep my name out your mouth/ I'll keep my foot out your gut” on bonus track “Fuck Them Bitches”; Kelis who brilliantly allows “I'm not trying to wear the pants/ They fit you right” on the respect-hungry “Appreciate Me”, a mournful choir cheering on her heartsick moan. No sane r&amp;b singer would risk it; who else could it be?

    raining, until, eventually, the rain just turned into snow. Coffee shop
    regulars told me it was an especially bad winter for the Pacific
    Northwest, but even amid the sleet breezes, I made plenty of treks to
    Mt. Tabor. When the weather was good, I jumped fences to pick
    fruit. If you were lucky enough to find a car, you could make a quick
    jump to the coast. Of all the cities I've temporarily called home,
    Portland coexisted best with the land it was built upon:
    Trees didn't feel like decorative afterthoughts.</p><p>
    Named for the
    fragrant, incense-burnt Agarwood,
    dark-metal quartet Agalloch are the perfect Portland band. Beginning as
    an idea in Montana sometime in late 1995/early 1996, founding members
    John Haughm and Jason Walton relocated to Oregon in 1996, where they
    met guitarist Don Anderson. Currently a quintet with drummer, Chris
    Greene, Agalloch's functioned as a proper group since releasing the
    1997 demo, <em>From Which of this Oak</em>. The band's third album, <span style=""font-style: italic"">Ashes Against the Grain</span>, the first full-length since 2002's <span style=""font-style: italic"">The Mantle </span>and
    sundry EPs, is their hugest, most artful collection to date. It
    features an endless amount of hooks-- songs appear to be going out to
    sea when things pause and change direction, ushering in another lap. If
    you think this stuff's boring, you aren't listening.</p><p>
    Ten-minute opener ""Limbs""
    floats Godspeed striations atop an Isis crunch. Gaining momentum,
    the swirl eventually moves toward an acoustic interlude, which offers a
    breath-catcher before the next spiral of echoing water-logged guitar
    and distorted drums. Floodgates open, close again, reopen. Lyrically,
    the ""limbs"" of the title refer to both human arms/legs (""Hacked,
    severed and forgotten"") and branches/roots: ""Earth to flesh, flesh to
    wood, cast these limbs into the water."" Time gets cast, ""Whispering
    from tree to tree/ Through every lonely bough it sings.""
    </p><p>
    Speaking
    of words, Agalloch might lose a few less hardy souls when vocalist John
    Haughm enters the mix: Instead of Slint speak/sing, buried shoegazer
    wails, or the by now acceptable doomy Ocean scowl, Haughm's gruff,
    slick, snarled black metal-style voice seethes above the sound. Once he
    clears his throat, everything else becomes a backdrop to his
    dry-rot laryngitis: ""The texture of the soul is a liquid/ That casts a
    vermillion flood/ From a wound carved as an oath/ It fills the river
    bank, a sanguine fog."" (Unless you have a degree in black metal, good
    luck getting that without a lyric sheet.)
    </p>
<p>
    But then, to my ears at
    least, where groups like Godspeed and Mogwai function merely as
    background music to my daily occurrences, Agalloch consistently
    engages and overrides. Some name-check arboreal, less urban Swans--
    especially when Jarboe stopped by the garden-- but Michael Gira was never
    about riffs like this. Comparisons
    to Opeth can and will also be penned. They work to some degree, but
    Agalloch add a shoegaze element to their intricate compositions: Unlike <span style=""font-style: italic"">Ghost Reveries</span>,
    the pieces don't feel as stitched together, and songs are long only if you pay attention to the display
    on your stereo. Keep your eyes closed and the anthemic ""Limbs"" could be
    divided into four pieces of occasionally proggy, neo-folk doom.
    </p>
<p>
    Same
    with ""Falling Snow"", which locates a catchy 1990s alterna-wavelength, as
    sludge guitars nestle behind psychedelic licks. The expressive, poppy
    notes make for a wonderful contrast between Haughm's cackled
    naturalistic lyrics: ""Red birds escape from my wounds and return as
    falling snow/ To sweep the landscape/ A wind haunted; wings without
    bodies."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Yup, the first two tracks require fist pumping, but
    Agalloch are much more than dog-and-pony rockers. ""This White Mountain on Which You Will Die"", a minute-and-a-half of sleepy, somber ambience,
    is a swath of Gregorian chant minus the chanting. A quintessential
    embodiment of that 1997 Oregon chill, the 10-plus minute ""Fire Above,
    Ice Below"" places watery guitar over acoustic strums. As it grows, the whispery vocals contrast with the more
    mannered folk-metal sound. The end of ""Fire Above, Ice Below"" sinks and
    recedes, blending into the AM
    static-ocean of the next track, ""Not Unlike the Waves"". It builds from
    that midst to major guitar-chug riffs, balancing a heaviness and a
    fragile sort of beauty. Like the forms made when a stone's dropped in a
    pond, the layers keep coming. For instance, acoustic interludes often
    signal things are about to grow exponentially magisterial: Multi-track
    vocal drone; a Malefic-mixed dry rot howl (lyrically, ""the midnight
    wolves who watch over the dawn"" makes perfect sense); submerged double
    bass drum. It's a Medieval doom madrigal built on a sea bed fault-line.
    </p>
<p>
    As
    if none of this was huge enough, the album closes with the grandiose
    three-part ""Our Fortress Is Burning"". The crux? Overall ambient
    submersion. The opening section moves from piano to
    strumming-n-drumming against falling stars and fuzz bath; a drum roll
    links it to the second part, and the track ends where Agalloch often does-- in melancholic triumph.
    The finale, subtitled ""The Grain"", is the one time the record lags a
    tad: It's pretty, but it lacks the propulsivity of what came before it.
    Agalloch squeeze enough ""epic"" into each ""endless horizon of ice"" that
    appending a self-consciously three-part finale could be taken as
    superfluous.
    </p>
<p>
    I've
    used the word ""metal"" a few times, but don't let that scare you
    off. I'd offer more qualifiers and nifty neologisms, but that seems
    equally tired. No matter what you call it, <span style=""font-style: italic"">Ashes</span>
    finds Agalloch burning down the forest, replanting it, watching shit
    re-grow. In the process of that intense musical exploration they've
    become an intriguing band, regardless
    of genre designation.

    In the most disquieting dreams, the horrible thing doesn't just <em>appear</em>; you suddenly realize it's been there, unnoticed, all along. This dream-sense of something unspeakable about to break into the open permeates Spielerfrau's debut LP. Recalling a sedate Nick Cave or Scott Walker-- no overstated theatrics here, just darkly glistering innuendo-- Spielerfrau's elegant gloom manages to be stately and spry at once. Fluid acoustic guitars crack into hard-edged starbursts; a Wurlitzer burbles and moans; subtle shifts in emphasis outline the disaster without naming it. And lest the band be perceived as no fun, here's ""Alt"": A sleek, Krauty burner complete with smarmy robot-voice, ""pseudo-bisexual bobbysoxers,"" ""Ms. Arulpragasam's paper tigers in press releases,"" ""a Midwestern hausfrau's dirt-thirst."" It's a great, over-the-top diversion on a record that's otherwise the model of circumspection. Vocalist and Pitchfork contributor Michael Idov could never get away with lyrics like ""November Third""'s ""I want to kick someone in the face"" if it weren't for the subtlety of his posh-ghoul murmur, the starry funeral march seething beneath the sentiment, and the subsequent motivational softening-- the violent act is  an attempt to ""bring back better days,"" when impulse trumped decorum.</p><p>
    The tension between politesse and rapturous sensation is Idov's central theme, and over the course of <em>The Sad Part</em>, he develops it with wit, tact, and striking language that serves specificity and beauty, not Decemberists-style ostentation. Symbolically loaded artifacts sweep across the somber record like blushes of candlelight in a dim room-- tablespoons of ash and thimbles of asbestos, garden fountains and marble wells, shards of glass in cocktail ice and seagulls in car parks. The gently unspooling ""Social Call"" is a digest of buttoned-down, post-break-up banality, except for the one erumpent image of a ""hate-fuck, pressed against a subway grate, in yellow snow, with trains below."" But the dissatisfaction cuts both ways. On ""Long &amp; Happy"", the burglar-protagonist-- and who could be freer from social constraints than someone who invades the homes of others?-- sits on a stranger's bed, closes his eyes, and sees ""a long and happy life,"" which he can obliquely access only through the theft of objects: ""Some money, a hi-fi, a chef's knife."" In Spielerfrau's world, one sings about objects and scenes because one isn't allowed to sing about feelings and events. And at any rate, the actual murder is prosaic compared to the looming shadow of the knife, or the knife itself, pulsing with the coiled menace of no context. </p></div>"|9315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9315-the-sad-part/|7.5|Brian Howe

    Here's
    that last summer blockbuster hurrah. Well, for dance-punk at least. On
    their followup to 2005's <em>Always Never Again</em>, Washington D.C. outfit
    Supersystem (formerly critics' punching bag El Guapo) have mostly outgrown the annoying tics of their former band, but no amount of synthesizer layering, glitchy beats,
    or other sparkling special effects can mask the album's famished
    backbone.</p><p>
    It's all a
    shame too-- especially since these guys are so much smarter than your
    run-of-the-mill dance-punk fodder. They almost never make the same
    mistake twice, but rather find new ways to sound mediocre, save for
    their potentially flash-in-pan single ""Born Into the World"". ""The Lake"" showcases this phenomenon perfectly.
    Saddling up on a cyclical bassline and sprinkled guitar lines, the
    song's got all the trappings of DFA <em>je no sais quoi</em> but lacks the spirit, instead riding the same four notes to dullsville.</p><p>
    Ironically, Supersystem's tragic flaw as dance-punks stems from their desire to be a pop
    band, a strange twist considering the legions of pop-oriented bands
    grandstanding as Cure/Gang of Four brethren these days. As a result,
    Supersystem mortgage any rhytmic muscle for the sake of half-baked
    sing-along choruses and painfully fist-pumped anthems. ""White Light /
    White Light"" winks at the Velvets classic, though the hipster cred is
    lost amidst a flurry of sci-fi beeps and blasts that want to trick
    listeners into thinking they're plugged into the Matrix. ""The Pinnacle
    of Experience"" suffers from similar Information Age diarrhea, the
    half-rapped vocals crammed with a few too many lyrics and drug culture
    commentary, the song bogged down by shrill synth lines that grate like
    a 56k modem dial-up.
    </p>
<p>
    As far
    as highlights go, there's a lot that sticks but little worth
    revisiting. For every pretty melody on the album, such as the opening
    synth harps of ""Eagles Fleeing Eyries"", 10 garden variety new wave
    hooks sprout up, each barely more sophisticated than nursery rhymes,
    though equally aggravating when repeated. For all its
    intellectualism-on-sleeveness, <em>A Million Microphones</em> gets a mulligan after <em>Always Never Again</em> and botches it in almost the exact same manner, leaving another clump of misshapen ideas for the dance-punk community to shun.

With each new record since 1997's stellar <em>Time Out of Mind</em>, music writers and editors have been tripping all over themselves trying to sputter out the best, most dramatic encapsulation of Dylan's rebirth (which, given the relative late-career flops of his peers and his own 1980s shitstorm, still seems strange and thrilling). Now, 45 years into a perfectly studied, over-anthologized, well-chronicled career, even talking about the cult-of-Dylan seems clichéd: Analysis of Dylan-love, Dylan-backlash, Dylan-histrionics, and Dylanology is moot. Books have been published, academic treatises have been defended, documentaries have been ordered and directed, cover stories have been savored and parsed-- but every time Bob Dylan cranks out a new record, we still try, again, to figure out what it all adds up to.</p><p>
<em>Modern Times</em> is Bob Dylan's 31st studio LP, and an obvious companion piece to 2001's <em>Love and Theft</em>, offering new tracks of jazz-inspired, rockabilly-scamming, ragtime-aping rock'n'roll, more heavily indebted to blues and honky-tonk than Woody Guthrie and Folkways. The record does little to persuade disbelievers, will continue to infuriate those who cheered when Pete Seeger jerked the plug at Newport, and isn't entirely unfamiliar: Anyone who's seen Dylan play in the past five years will recognize the silhouette here, hunched over a keyboard, all crags and angles, brambles of hair puffing out from under a big black hat, pencil mustache combed into place, pounding keys, infinitely more compelled by his fellow players than his sycophantic audience. Unsurprisingly, <em>Modern Times</em> is musically intricate, thick, and expertly played, more the product of a well-rehearsed-- but still gorgeously mellow-- band than an auteur. It also contains some of the softest, funniest, and most charming songs of Dylan's late career, as he snickers to himself, cooing about love, God, and doing it (""I got the pork chops/ She got the pie"").</p><p>
    Dylan recently spat a series of (now-notoriously) curmudgeonly comments to Jonathan Lethem in <em>Rolling Stone</em>, pining that nothing sounds like shellac-- and while his complaints seemed depressingly stodgy, they were also promptly misconstrued and yanked out of context; as it were, Dylan was deriding contemporary production/studio techniques and not the whole of modern music, which becomes instantly and weirdly obvious to anyone who listens to the lyrics to raucous opener ""Thunder on the Mountain"" (""I was thinking about Alicia Keys, couldn't help from crying/ When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line/ I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be/ I been looking for her even clean through Tennessee""), or considers the fact that Dylan produced this record himself (under favored stage-name Jack Frost).
    </p><p>
    Still, it's obvious that Dylan's most beloved songs are old ones, and he borrows gleefully from Nina Simone, Memphis Minnie, Carl Perkins, Muddy Waters, and, in the grand tradition of AP Carter and John Lomax, plenty of unnamed songwriters whose work long ago slipped into public domain. ""Rollin' and Tumblin'"" (Muddy Waters famously recorded the song in 1950, but its origins date back to at least 1929) is given a new workup, infused with Dylan's signature clatter and wheeze and punched up with peppery guitar and even spicier lyrics (""I got trouble so hard, I just can't stand this dream/ Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains""). Meanwhile, ""Nettie Moore"" (a well-worn 19th century ballad) is staggering, a spare blend of vocals and light, airy instrumentation, Dylan's decaying pipes tut-tutting sweet proclamations of love: ""When you're around me/ All my grief gives way/ A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day/ Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong."" ""Workingman's Blues 2"" is similarly gentle and lapping, and ""The Levee's Gonna Break"", with its familiar Zeppelin-via-Memphis-Minnie refrain (""If it keeps on raining/ The levee's gonna break""), seems almost self-referential (""I paid my time/ And now I'm as good as new…Some of these people are gonna strip you of all they can take"").
    </p>
<p>
    The biggest disappointment here is that <em>Modern Times</em> is probably Dylan's least-surprising release in decades-- it's the logical continuation of its predecessor, created with the same band he's been touring with for years, fed from familiar influences, and sprinkled with all the droll, anachronistic bits now long-expected. Dylan's voice, sinking further into grit, is all wheeze and mew, rolled in salt but still instantly recognizable. And now that he's eyebrows-deep in the rock'n'roll canon, maybe the heart-stopping appeal of Bob Dylan has less to do with his output-- which, tangentially, remains outstanding-- and more to do with his cowboy boot-saunter. Maybe we all want a little bit of Dylan's superhuman restraint, and whether it's real or brutally calculated doesn't actually matter: The fuck-off detachment, the unconcerned genius, the squinty-eyed disdain, the arid, gut-punching humor, the total (if feigned) disinterest in his growing superhero status. He's the boy who doesn't love us back, the one everyone yearns for, the Holy Grail, the last American hero.

In the middle of their 2005 tour, they decided it would be their last, without any big announcement or farewell extravaganza.

<em>Thunder Down Under</em>, like a lot of live albums, doesn't differ dramatically from the recorded versions of its songs. So this album isn't incontrovertible proof of Hot Snakes' live prowess, but there's enough to clue us in-- there's an obvious nonchalance from the in-jokes and spontaneous setlist decisions that never undercuts the performances. What raises its consideration even further is a) Its timing, as not a redundant cash-in but a gift to still-hungry fans, and b) Its fidelity, culled from in-studio performances for Australia's Triple-J station.</p><p>
    But weren't their albums essentially live in-the-studio anyways? And didn't those albums have excellent production in their own right? Yes, and on <em>Thunder Down Under</em>, something's lost and something's gained. The bass is lost behind the clarity of the twin guitars, and the drums are somewhat muffled, nowhere close to the expertly-recorded rhythm section on the band's fine three-album run. Yet whether it's a conscious choice or just the difficulty of keeping up his consistent forceful bleat from the records, Froberg pulls his voice back a bit and adds more character to these songs in the process.
    </p><p>
    As this was recorded while Hot Snakes toured behind <em>Audit in Progress</em>, the setlist leans heavily on material from that record, an exemplary rock album that's not quite as exemplary as the two that came before it. Still, I'd take most of these versions over the ones on <em>Audit</em>-- the throbbing bass chords in the latter half of ""Braintrust"" add palpable chaos, and Froberg's alternating between a scream and an aloof taunt on ""Hi-lites"" bring more dimension to a previously straightforward strummer. If only he'd used that subtlety on ""Plenty for All"", the song that closed their final studio album and hinted at uncharted, more melodic territory. Here, it's charged through nonchalantly mid-album, slagged through like an old standard instead of a new digression. 
    </p>
<p>
    Worth noting are the songs from the band's best record, <em>Suicide Invoice</em>. The stops and starts of ""L.A.X."" were tailor-made to impress live, and they don't disappoint here: the single-note guitar lines weave gracefully above a menacingly tight band. Same goes for ""Who Died"", the record's toothiest performance, but ""Suicide Invoice"" is the album highlight, adding not only mania but real dread to the album's final third. 
    </p>
<p>
    To quote some common sense, a great record is probably a sign of an even better live band. A great live record, however, is a much rarer thing. But the Hot Snakes were a rare band: Three untouchable records, a peerless live show, and now a live record
    that does more than hold status quo, occasionally
    improving upon and revealing more than their brief recorded output. That's worth more than faint praise, and worth releasing.

The artwork is telling: After temporarily closing shop for several years, the old market leader in minimal house has returned, shorn of any residual intellectual pretensions. New label-star Unai mixes label releases and drafted-in contributions from like-minded associates, in the process revealing a near across-the-board generational change. The selection of Unai to helm the release is logical: His brand of glitchy, romantic disco-pop is highly reminiscent of old label hero Luomo, and is thus the closest thing to a link between the label's different incarnations.</p><p>
    But while previous editions in the series flirted with overt songstructure and polystylistic eclecticism, Unai's mix perversely returns to the scrupulous deepness of the label's 2001 Andrew Weatherall mix <em>Hypercity</em> (although it understandably lacks the epochal feel of that mix). Most of the tracks here are drifty instrumentals, delicately constructed from roaming keyboard melodies, warm electronic basslines, multi-tiered house percussion, and scintillating dub atmospherics. Where <em>Hypercity</em> frequently flirted with arctic severity-- the arrangements rarely doing more than they absolutely needed to-- the tracks here revel in their own voluptuous layering: the keyboard melodies often feel like enormous transparent clouds of vapour, filling up the entire room. It's not that the grooves are busy-- far from it-- but that they derive their notion of ""deepness"" as much from Plastic City-style tech-house as from minimal, and in this sense ""deepness"" equates with ""plumpness."" At its best, much current minimal resembles a beautiful profusion of bristling thistles, but while <em>Digital Disco 3</em> can be prickly at times, it mostly wants to embrace you in the soft, warm folds of its flesh.</p><p>
    Perhaps it was inevitable, though, that the only bona fide anthem here would the album's most ""minimal' moment-- the sublime high-register syncopated arpeggios of Ame's ""Rej"", whose slightly Latin feel and universal popularity makes it something of a modern-day ""Strings of Life"". Even ""Rej"" fits the project's brief perfectly: Avoiding any climactic release, it instead captures that brand of tense equilibrium that has long been spooky tech-house's calling card; all that is left is a captivating sense of anticipation-without-end. After its arrival in the middle of the album, the second half of the mix drifts closer to an electro-house sensibility: The synth riffs become more prominent, the beats slightly more stiffly propulsive, the basslines more grinding, the vibe more overtly ""futurist"" (in a perhaps unintentional piece of Space Age commentary, John Tejada's bouncy Voyager is mixed into Crane A.K.'s churning Sputnik). But Unai doesn't abandon his emphasis on deepness-- only soundalike remixes of Unai singles by Martinez and Trentemøller offer the sort of songful pop thrills you might expect, and then only in carefully measured doses. </p><p>
    While its sweep is fairly broad, at least alluding to the entire spectrum of current European house sounds, between this distaste for climaxes, the unobtrusive track transitions and the general consistency of the contributions, Unai's mix feels like it covers hardly any ground at all. Those looking for a State of the Nation on house or techno will doubtless be disappointed, but if, like me, you have a high tolerance for largely faceless but rhapsodically rippling electronic house, you'll find much to enjoy in its decadent pulse.<br/></p></div>"|9320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9320-digital-disco-3/|7.8|Tim Finney

    The second album by Canadian singer/songwriter Lullaby Baxter hints at
    multiple pasts and a candy-coated, just-out-of-reach future. The title, <em>Garden
    Cities of To-morrow</em>, is a reference to British urban planner Ebenezer
    Howard's 1902 tome of the same name, which laid out a futuristic vision of
    communities that married town and country life in a single setting. Howard was
    also an avid Esperanto speaker and is partly responsible for inspiring Disney's
    Epcot. Baxter's jazzy alto, meanwhile, carries echoes of singers like Ella
    Fitzgerald, with a sprinkle of pixie dust rather than the venti cappuccino
    smoothness of such like-minded chanteuses as Norah Jones and Madeline Peyroux.
    Pop duo Hercules, who produce, lavish Baxter's songs with the 1960s baroque-pop
    perfectionism of their overlooked 2004 album, <em>In the Alleyway</em>.</p><p>
<em>Garden Cities of To-morrow</em> lacks the touches of artful noise that
    intermittently added texture to <em>In the Alleyway</em>, though a few storm-like
    tendrils do strike the lounge penguin-cruise of ""Antarctica"".
    Hercules' Peter Baldwin and Ben Sumner are like French duo Air with a yen for
    orchestras instead of synths and fewer TV commercial gigs. Flugelhorn leans
    against shy acoustic guitars on ""Little Song"", while standout
    ""Sugar"" opens with pulsing ""I Am the Walrus"" Mellotron
    before dissolving in country-rock lead guitar licks, delirious strings,
    whirling Wurlitzer, and ostinato bass line. A flute quartet, harp, timpani,
    marimba, and even djembe dress up other tracks in full Herculean garb, with
    Ennio Morricone's flair for the cinematic.</p><p>
    Baxter herself carries on the quirky yet sophisticated style of her 2000
    debut <em>Capable Egg</em>, with one foot in over-the-rainbow whimsy and the
    other in the contemporary singer/songwriter tradition. She's prone to eccentric
    figurative language that straddles the line between endearing and irritating,
    depending on your taste: the relatively spare ""Cardboard Armoured
    Car"" is full of 'em, culminating in ""The world is my potato,""
    while the most Jones-like track here, ""Fontana Fontaine"", jumps from
    ""you loved me like a circus"" to ""good old Kansas City"". She
    gets the mixture just right on the aforementioned ""Sugar"":
    ""Cursed at the moon/ 'til you both turned blue"", as Wurlitzer bends
    nostalgia into pathos. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Garden Cities of To-morrow</em> is an acquired taste: both too weird and
    too ordinary at once, but when Baxter matches her urbane oddities and Hercules'
    pastoral popscaping just right, it's like a stroll through leafy, tree-lined
    city blocks in early autumn twilight. While Baldwin and Sumner have yet to work
    with songs that perfectly suit their approach, this album's best moments set
    their distinctive arrangements alongside bits of jazz and fairytale magic, a
    masterwork of urban planning for a city out of an enchanted kingdom. Not Epcot,
    though.

    August is a hot month in Atlanta, and the weather these last few days has been a little unsettling, as if it's tricking us into thinking that fall is here when we all know it's still two months away. But looking out the window at the gray haziness, I can't imagine a better musical match than Venice Is Sinking's dreamy pop; with its co-ed harmonies and wandering streams of dense melodies, it is the perfect soundtrack for unexpected overcast days.</p><p>
    The Athens, Geo., band's sound is reminiscent of the early days of alternative rock, when the term ""college rock"" still had significance. The violins recall Camper Van Beethoven, but the music is lush and romantic. Throughout each track, co-vocalists Karolyn Troupe and Daniel Lawson weave their voices through one another, and while Lawson is traditionally in the lead role, it's the combination of their voices that works so well.  ""Pulaski Heights"" establishes the album's mood with layers of guitar and violin over a driving beat. But the real atmosphere comes from the vocals that ohh and ahh in the background, as if echoing up from the bottom of a cave or simply seeping out of the back of your brain. Perhaps the disc's biggest fault, though, is that this mood never changes. There are songs that are a little more upbeat than others, but beyond that, they are all very similar. As a result, the songs sort of drift by, at times settling into the background.</p><p>
    But if doleful, nostalgic pop is your bag, there is little to complain about with this set. The band employs a wide range of auxiliary instrumentation to round out the traditional guitar-led lineup, and often it's these instruments that define the tracks in a way. ""Tours"" features bells and a variety of strings, creating an echo effect that works well with the dusty shuffle of the drums. On ""Buried Magnets"", it's the piano tinkling over one of the album's most explosive beats that captures your attention and create a cohesiveness that a lot of bands struggle to achieve on a debut. The album's only drastically different track is ""Blue By Late"", which concludes the disc with 20 minutes of ambient droning. According to the liner notes, the sounds that make up the track are all sliced up and blended from the other nine tracks. So while it's an odd choice for a record that is so strong on melody, they ultimately pull it off, and it ends up working as a unique closing chapter, tying the rest of the album together.

    mostly on songs (not style). Broadcast are the sort of particularly
    good band that usually manages to offer both. That's not just to say
    that their sound is inventive, or their production alluring, or any of
    that other brainy stuff, true as it may be. It's to say that they
    sound flat-out convincingly <em>cool</em>, something that's more important that
    most rock folks like to admit.</p><p>
    Since their terrific first EPs, collected on <em>Work and Non-Work</em> (1997), Broadcast have had more turtlenecked Euro beatnik chic than you'd expect from a band that's actually English: jazz swing, an elegant Françoise Hardy
    singer, Godard-film sleekness, cosmopolitan intrigue. Their
    influences were psychedelic without the usual ""rock"" hanging around
    after it, and yet they seemed somehow more in line with the kind of
    leftfield electronic music they never actually made. They produced
    some kind of special, languid reverb that made it so you could have
    listened to them fart around on organs for ten minutes and been
    reasonably happy about it. And yet you never had to, because they
    wrapped those things around such gorgeous, fully coherent songs--
    Bacharachs next to Stereolab's ""Louie Louie"". All thanks in part, I'm
    guessing, to the kind of work schedule that made us wait a good three
    years before they even got around to recording a proper album.</p><p>
    So after the grand changes and breakthroughs of last year's <em>Tender
    Buttons</em>, they're releasing this package, a set of EP tracks (and two
    compilation rarities) spanning the gap between that first collection
    and the present. The 18 tracks here are a battleground of that whole
    style-versus-songs thing: In between an impressive number of great
    second-string pop songs, you get a few full-on tastes of what it
    sounds like when the band really is just paddling around in its own
    style and atmosphere. Here and there we zone out into the background,
    into the incidental music for the parts of the imaginary tourfilm
    where Broadcast are just catching flights and setting up their
    equipment. And if you're devoted enough to this group's style,
    incidental music turns out to be likeable enough-- especially when, as
    on ""Minus Two"" or ""DDL"", it sees the group testing out new electronic
    ideas and production tricks. Elsewhere, it's just sleek instrumental
    swing, spy-movie soundtracks gone sci-fi, and only very occasionally
    irritating.
    </p><p>
    The praiseworthy part, though, comes as you sink into this, find your
    away around, and finally notice the significant number of pop tracks
    that could have slipped unobtrusively onto any of the band's LPs--
    sometimes as decent additions, sometimes even as stand-outs. (It can
    take a few listens to slip through the alluring atmospheres and start
    differentiating.) The band's 60s-psychedelic influences get clearer
    than usual on ""Unchanging Window"" (a modern ""White Rabbit"") and ""Poem
    of a Dead Song"" (which cops its structure direct from ""Some Velvet
    Morning""). ""Illumination"" and ""Where Youth and Laughter Go"" are the
    kind of sleepy jazz-combo psychedelics that stocked <em>Work and Non-Work</em>,
    the latter with a tremolo guitar hook that's the most golden moment on
    here. Then, like the musique concrete minimalism of ""Echo's Answer""
    (not included), there are tracks like ""Small Song IV"" and ""Distant
    Call""-- proving again that these folks can wind Trish Keenan's voice
    through the barest dots of sound and come off better than ever. Which
    is something they should do more often, and-- these days-- just might
    be.
    </p>
<p>
    Listening through all this is actually a strange experience, even to
    someone who heard most of these EPs as they first came out. This is a
    group that's always seemed stylish, even vaguely ""experimental""-- and
    yet they've released albums and compilations (<em>Work and Non-Work</em> chief
    among them!) that felt far more focused and consistent than that.
    Here's the first full-length Broadcast product that pulls back the
    veil and lets us hear big stretches of what it's like when they're
    trying sounds out, getting abstract, being well and truly difficult--
    exactly the sort of stuff other bands this stylish can be a little too
    quick to call finished and request your money for. It makes you think
    well of their quality control-- always taking extra time to refine
    themselves into a fascinating pop band, even when they sound this good
    without bothering, just having their fun with the ""interesting"" part.

    Lambchop seem to roll around the
    Middle Tennessee countryside like a giant blob, absorbing every musician in their path. Their line-up regularly tops double digits, and on 10th album <em>Damaged</em>, the total comes to 14, including Ryan Norris and Scott Martin of
    Nashville-based laptop group Hands Off Cuba, who hooked up with the band for last year's <em>CoLab</em> EP. Just as gospel singers gave <em>Nixon</em> its trippy joyousness in 2000, and Tony
    Crow's elegant piano lent 2004's<em> Is a
    Woman</em> its studied grace, Hands Off Cuba's contributions, while limited,
    seem to have determined the shape of this album.</p><p>
    The duo stand out most on the opening track, ""Paperback
    Bible"", which was inspired by Swap Shop, an East Tennessee
    radio program where people can sell anything from tractors to appliances to
    farmland-- sort of like an Appalachian eBay. Commissioned by Long Haul Productions
    for a short documentary segment broadcast on Chicago Public Radio,
    Lambchop's head songwriter Kurt Wagner took the lyrics directly from the show,
    and the opportunity allows him to consider pie safes and prom dresses as if
    they're poor Yorick's skull. Hands Off Cuba provide the shimmering intro and
    coda, a patient fade-in and unraveling fade-out that mimic radio waves but evoke
    rural dusks.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the band's work with Hands Off Cuba is limited to just a few songs,
    defusing the promising potential of combining Lambchop's organic sound with Norris
    and Martin's synthetic aesthetic. The duo is largely absent from the nine songs
    that follow ""Paperback Bible"", aside from one or two brief, superfluous
    interludes. However, Lambchop does absorb a lesson from Hands Off Cuba: <em>Damaged</em> emphasizes ambience above all
    else, setting a mood redolent of empty rooms and dusty sills on ""Prepared [2]""
    and rarely deviating from that space. It's a nice setting for Wagner's
    household poetry, which explores the mundane vagaries of family life. These
    songs generally depict the everyday tensions that pervade a home following a
    disagreement or argument, although he rarely specifies the event that inspires each
    track. Instead he focuses on the fallouts and the small epiphanies that follow,
    which range from the mundane (""It's been a lousy day,"" he concludes on ""I Would
    Have Waited All Day"") to the apologetically oddball (""I am the most
    undisciplined of man,"" he acknowledges ambiguously on ""Prepared [2]"").
    </p>
<p>
    But Wagner is a very disciplined songwriter, and Lambchop are
    a very disciplined blob, which makes <em>Damaged</em>
    sound repressed. The music is all pristine veneer, stripped of any trace of the
    country or soul that marked their earlier material and made them sound like the
    most involved pick-up band ever. So <em>Damaged</em>
    is lovely but dull in spots, lacking the fuck-all adventurousness of previous
    albums. It's not until the final song that Wagner and Lambchop really cut
    loose. ""The Decline of Country &amp; Western Civilization"" is a
    fire-and-brimstone rant against contemporary music that makes Dylan seem like a regular pop enthusiast. Wagner name-checks Nathan Bedford Forrest in the first
    line (perhaps as a condemnation of Southern rock?), laments that people still
    think Lambchop peaked with<em> How I Quit
    Smoking</em>, and remarks that he prefers Jim Nabors to anything this site
    covers. Lyrically and musically, the song is thunderous and over the top, but
    after so much restraint, such spirited hostility is a salve.

    I know you gotta suffer for your art, but damn.<em> Over the Mountain, Across the Valley, and
    Back to the Stars</em>, indie folk singer Jennifer O'Connor's third album and
    first for Matador, includes songs inspired by the deaths of her two sisters, which make the stormy break-up that also precipitated the album
    seem like just another day in the life. That's a lot of gravity for one record;
    fewer losses have inspired dismally funereal records or bounce-back albums full
    of forced recovery aphorisms. O'Connor, thankfully, isn't looking to sob or
    even really to commiserate. The percolating bassline and gently ascending
    chorus on the opener ""Century Estates"" signals as much at the earliest
    opportunity.</p><p>
    These songs sound like the culmination of a deeply personal
    process of coming to terms rather than four-minute therapy sessions, which
    means O'Connor can pull off a plainspoken chorus like ""Sister I miss you"" on
    ""Sister"" without sounding maudlin or manipulative. When she sings, ""And he
    calls twice a week/ Just to hear me speak/ And we don't talk about what's gone
    or who's left without,"" it takes a minute for the implications to settle in:
    She's talking not to you, but to her sister, about her father, and she caps the
    song with the devastatingly simple observation: ""There's no way it's ever gonna
    be okay/ Ever again."" O'Connor's forthrightness-- both lyrical and vocal-- makes
    ""Sister"" one of the most genuinely affecting pop songs you'll hear all year,
    capably expressing adult pain without any delusions that pain makes you
    particularly soulful or special.</p><p>
    To strike this balance between the emotional and the
    plainspoken, O'Connor has stripped away most of the atmospheric elements that
    lent her previous albums their moody gravity, and the pared-back aesthetic
    suits her unpretentious voice and plainspoken lyrics, which generally eschew
    the poetics of likeminded performers Laura Veirs and Azure Ray. It's as if any
    artful veneer applied to these songs might up-end their message or dilute their
    impact. Even the headstrong rock songs like ""Bullshit Maze"" and ""Perfect Match""
    come across as austere and elemental. In this environment, Britt Daniel's
    backing vocals on ""Dirty City Blues"" or the plaintive violin on ""Complicated
    Rhyme"" sound like full orchestration.
    </p>
<p>
    Not every song here is about death, but every song is about
    loss. Parts of<em> Over the Mountain</em> were
    inspired by romantic fallout, and at the core of each track is a stinging
    absence, either one she is experiencing or one that looms before her. On ""Exeter,
    Rhode Island"", the album's most upbeat
    track, O'Connor longs for a secure life in a small town, but the distraction of
    pop radio and the barely audible sigh in her voice suggest it's a hollow dream.
    On the tender ""Today"", over a lone acoustic guitar, she readies herself to make
    a romantic leap, but on the abrasive next track, ""Bullshit Maze"", she castigates
    herself for a string of bad decisions. And it's clear that the apology that
    forms ""I Was So Wrong"" comes way too late. Instead of ending on the down note
    of ""Tonight We Ride"", O'Connor at least closes <em>Over the Mountain</em> with the sing-along ""I'll Bring You Home"", which
    sounds particularly joyous even if its lyrics describe the same bullshit maze
    she's been running through all along.

    Folk rock compilations have been sprouting like dandelions in recent months, as various labels have tried to get their arms around the ongoing profusion of new and reissued folk-related material. Complicating matters is the fact that the current international folk revival is less a unified movement than a series of smaller, overlapping sub-movements that might include any variety of American Primitive guitarists, free-form avant-folk collectives, ramshackle campfire pop, medieval-tinged electronica, or wayfaring acoustic singer-songwriters. Predictably, the general upshot has been that a large number of wildly disparate acts have frequently been lumped together under the same banner despite sharing little or nothing in common.</p><p>
    The latest collection to attempt to make sense of it all is <em>Folk Off!</em>, a 2xCD set from UK label Sunday Best. Dubious pun notwithstanding, the album's title is intended rather literally. The compilation is cheekily packaged as a competitive folk-off, with North America and the British Isles each getting one full disc to prove their supremacy, ignoring for the moment the enormous musical debts the two regions owe to one another. For the occasion, Sunday Best's curator Rob Da Bank has used a broad and imprecise definition of the term folk, casting a perimeter wide enough to corral such decidedly borderline folkies as Micah P. Hinson, Acid Casuals, and Magnétophone. Unfortunately, the set also chooses to ignore the massive free/drone/psych wing of contemporary folk almost entirely, instead focusing an unflattering degree of attention on sleepy-eyed acoustic pop and tepid bedroom electronica.</p><p>
    Fortified by familiar, previously-released tracks like Sufjan Stevens' ""Decatur, Or, a Round of Applause for Your Stepmother"" and Animal Collective's ""Kids on Holiday"", the North American half of <em>Folk Off!</em> is its most uniformly satisfying. If you want to get pedantic about it, however, few of these tracks genuinely owe much of anything to American folk tradition. To domestic ears, Hinson's opening ""Yard of Blonde Girls"" might skew more closely to standard alt-country, while Baby Dee's luminous ""Morning Holds a Star"" appears as a mystical sort of space cabaret. Philadelphia's Espers prove the exception to the rule, and their reverent take on the traditional ""Rosemary Lane"" sounds just as handsome in this mixed company as it did on their 2005<em> The Weed Tree</em> EP. 
    </p>
<p>
    The selection criteria gets even more lax and confusing on the album's British Isles side, which ranges from the strictly traditionalist (Deep Elem's ""Lost in the Woods') to the not-identifiably-folk-whatsoever (Same Actor's ""Nothing Yet""). Of course, such genre distinctions wouldn't matter much if the mix were consistently entertaining. Vashti Bunyan's ""Here Before"" and Song of Green Pheasants' ""Nightfall"" provide a pair of dusky highlights, but too many of the remaining soporific tracks combine into a lukewarm, treacly mush. James Yorkston &amp; Reporter's ""Woozy With Cider"" is a meandering bit of digital spoken-word that brings any momentum to a crashing halt, while the inclusion of Acid Casuals' neo-sock-hop ditty ""Bowl Me Over"" just seems inexplicable, unless the <em>American Graffiti</em> soundtrack is now considered some kind of folk relic. 
    </p>
<p>
    In the liner notes, Pete Paphides credits some of the current folk revival to the music's easy portability, a point that seems somewhat ironic since it appears that many of the artists on this collection did all of their recording home alone in their bedrooms. By omitting such significant (and adventurous) folk-inspired voices as Ben Chasny, Richard Youngs, Josephine Foster, Charalambides, Matt Valentine, Vibracathedral Orchestra, etc. <em>Folk Off!</em> is woefully incomplete as a primer on the contemporary folk scene, and thereby fails to adequately illustrate the extraordinary artistic value our shared folkloric traditions might have for tomorrow's more enlightened musicians and listeners.

Spare, one-man acoustic songs, disjointed blues, melodic lo-fi indie, lush classical string arrangements, and bristling electro-- Longstreth's dived into all of it with equal aplomb. But if his last LP, <em>Getty Address</em>, showed off his ability for synthesis, he had yet to make an album on which he played it <em>all</em>.</p><p>
    That is, until the release of <em>New Attitude</em>, a once-tour-only EP that's now enjoying rebirth as a proper release. Several past modes of Projectors are revisited here, providing a peek at the seams in Longstreth's style, as well as one live track that gives fans a taste of what they might be missing at the band's increasingly stunning concerts.<em> </em>The record opens with ""Fucked for Life""-- a  pop track that does everything in its power to hide that it's a pop track-- with a bewildering call-and-response between Longstreth's caterwaul and the pluck of dusty acoustic strings. The opening multi-tracked wail brings a cold-water shock I often get when first reapproaching Dirty Projectors, but the ambling bassline soon affirms that something far more accessible lurks just beneath the surface.</p><p>
    ""Two Sheep Asleep"" uses much of the same instrumentation to a less compelling end, as Longstreth employs a strange, breathless yodel/grunt over more acoustic guitar and staccato synth stabs,  here more percussive than melodic.  But ""Two Young Sheeps"", the album's lone live cut, expands ""Two Sheep Asleep"" into
    an ecstatic exclamation of young love, with Longstreth shouting
    about ""him and his girl"" over the breezy, vaguely funky beat.
    Unfortunately, the gaiety of the electric piano and flute doesn't quite
    translate in its (roughly) recorded version, despite being a truly
    unencumbered moment and a smiling breath of relief. <br/>
</p><p>
    Elsewhere, ""Imagine It"" features more hyper-deconstruction, as guitars loop and sputter while Longstreth switches on the falsetto to sound like a girl-group singing a 1950s radio jingle. Admittedly, much of the reason Longstreth draws attention is the power of his delightfully over-the-top voice, and there's not much showboating on <em>New Attitude</em>. Fans of <em>Slaves' Graves and Ballads</em> will appreciate the classically-minded ""Likeness of Uncles"" or ""Darkened Car"", where a  suitably dramatic string chart plays second fiddle to the yearning and anguish in Longstreth's voice.</p><p>
<em>New Attitude</em> does nothing to diminish Longstreth's singular talents, but even for a tour EP-- even for a <em>Dirty Projectors</em> tour EP-- this is pretty spotty. While the release is understandably more suited to those already familiar, it's worth keeping in mind that Projectors fans also have older, weirder releases to relish (<em>Morning Better Last</em>, for starters). I appreciate a more relaxed look at Longstreth's group, but the band could stand to apply that attitude to a stronger batch of songs somewhere down the line-- even if they've already moved on to something completely different.

That's more than enough to make for a striking career in itself: It's 1983, and the Cure is already epically great. But there's a difference between a great rock act and the kind of long-running international pop favorite this band was bound to be, and the music that comes next is what makes that difference.</p>
<p>The mid-80s are the years in which the Cure ceases to be a rock band and becomes a vehicle to plumb Robert Smith's imagination. Asian art, psychedelics, hallucinations-- with the act's lineup effectively swapped to bits, Smith takes up the reins of the studio, and he seems to see each individual song as a chance to literalize some particular dream of his, using pop arrangements to create little worlds that feel astonishingly visual. It's a shame these reissues can't include the band's already-compiled singles from this era, because it's in their ever-changing styles that you get the best sense of what he was doing: trying on a joyous fake-jazz strut for ""The Lovecats"", making ""The Caterpillar"" sound like a broken-down music conservatory for fairies, doing bratty, funky synthpop on ""Let's Go to Bed"" and chilly electro on ""The Walk"". Rock bands sound good within the context of being rock bands; pop songs like these carried their own context with them, each one a dream to step into.</p>
<p><i>The Top</i> (1984), however, is not that Cure. Yes, ""The Caterpillar"" is on here, and ""Dressing Up"" has a sexy pop-song elegance that's certainly new. But this full-length is the sound of a rock band stretching out in a much less controlled and occasionally bitter way: There are shades of gnarled psychedelia scattered throughout. Songs like ""Give Me It"" and ""Shake Dog Shake"" scream and blurt with a grim, bristly rage. The band's signature dirges suddenly feel formless and lethargic in a <i>bad </i>way. The rough home and studio demos on the bonus disc are hard listening in spots, but also instructive: In hearing Smith labor to make this material whole, you get a better sense of how the scattershot styles of the album could be stemming from the same source.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Smith was also recording and touring as a guitar player for fellow goth travelers Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees-- which is part of how we get the Glove, a psych-pop side project for Smith and Banshees bassist Steve Severin. This series is kind enough to include a deluxe package of the band's sole, hard-to-find full-length, 1983's <i>Blue Sunshine</i>. With singer Jeanette Landray taking Siouxsie-like leads on most tracks, the sound is about what you'd expect from a Cure/Banshees crossover, or at least one entranced by Beatles psychedelia. (The band's name comes from <i>Yellow Submarine</i>; around the time this was released, the Banshees were enjoying a hit with a cover of ""Dear Prudence"".) For most of the record, though-- ""Like an Animal"", or the Smith-sung ""Mr. Alphabet Says""-- what you'd expect is something fairly great, and a definite treat for Cure and Banshees fans who haven't gotten their hands on this yet.</p>
<p>Then there's <i>The Head on the Door</i> (1985). Saying that this is the Cure's most focused pop album-- with a crucial new band lineup solidified, Porl Thompson's guitar on board, and everyone sounding keen and intent-- might seem like a massive compliment, but that designation turns out to be a bit tricky. The singles here were the band's most straightforward to date: An ingratiating rush of guitar on ""In Between Days"", a jolly twinkling love song on ""Close to Me"", sappy 80s drama on ""A Night Like This"". The songs in between make for the sole 80s Cure album you could think about playing at a beach party-- check the strangely Van Halen-ish sustained chords on ""Push."" And Smith's dreamy imagination of far-away places gets pleasantly touristic: plinking atmospherics on ""Kyoto Song,"" super-speed Spanish guitar on ""The Blood"". It's a tight, terrific package, and more imaginative than albums this controlled usually get, but it's oddly removed from one of the qualities people have always loved best about the Cure-- the deep, sprawling sound of an album like <i>Disintegration</i>.</p>
<p>But then there's <i>Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me </i>(1987), the place where every one of these things comes together. This band is best remembered for <i>Disintegration</i>, yes-- it's the kind of epic, single-minded ""statement"" that asks to be put up on pedestals. Thing is, you don't get the kind of teenage-bedroom devotion this band got by making epic, single-minded statements. In order to get people to dress like you-- to make a whole world out of your music-- you have to <i>offer </i>them a whole world, one that encompasses all of their moods, every waking moment of their days.</p>
<p>The 18 tracks of <i>Kiss Me</i>'s double-LP do exactly that. Every major mode of the Cure is here, and sounding better than ever, each one a realm of its own. There's grand, tormented wailing (""The Kiss"", ""Fight"") next to tender, sunny numbers (""Catch""). There are creepy-crawly Orientalist nightmares (""The Snake Pit"", ""If Only Tonight We Could Sleep"") and slow, sparkling romances (""One More Time""). There are bitter shouts (""Shiver and Shake""), all-pop numbers (""Just Like Heaven""), and complex intersections between the two (""Hot Hot Hot"", ""Why Can't I Be You?""). Smith's lyrics even find, among the usual animals and anguish, a set of linchpin images that reflect in each of those directions. There is a mouth on the cover, and the songs are full of devouring-- both the devouring mouths of desire and the fear of being consumed. Christmas gets to evoke both gaudy colors and sad nostalgia. There's the deep, dark water that would soon be all over <i>Disintegration</i>, and there's an endless romantic push and pull: someone so perfect that Smith asks ""Why can't I be you?"" and someone else so perfect that Smith asks, ""You want to know why I hate you?"" Some of these songs play out mixed-up emotions-- weird crossovers of depression and joy, love and loathing, anger and resignation-- that we barely have names for. Bitter torture and giddy excitement and desire, desire, desire: They all come together into one almost maniacally impassioned thing.</p>
<p>This is the world of the raccoon-eyed, mumbling, moping, endlessly sensitive late-80s Cure fan in one gorgeous, totally immersive package, and it's one of the most convincing, emotionally whole, and individual albums of the decade-- an entire imagined land, complete with sounds, visions, and styles, huge on romance and drama. If you were only ever to buy one Cure album, most people would point you to that landmark <i>Disintegration</i>, and there's every chance you'd be amazed by it. But for the whole breadth of the Cure-- and what seems like the whole head of Smith-- in one glorious package, this is the one that matters.</p></div>"|11887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11887-the-top-the-head-on-the-door-kiss-me-kiss-me-kiss-me-blue-sunshine/|6.9|Nitsuh Abebe

That's more than enough to make for a striking career in itself: It's 1983, and the Cure is already epically great. But there's a difference between a great rock act and the kind of long-running international pop favorite this band was bound to be, and the music that comes next is what makes that difference.</p>
<p>The mid-80s are the years in which the Cure ceases to be a rock band and becomes a vehicle to plumb Robert Smith's imagination. Asian art, psychedelics, hallucinations-- with the act's lineup effectively swapped to bits, Smith takes up the reins of the studio, and he seems to see each individual song as a chance to literalize some particular dream of his, using pop arrangements to create little worlds that feel astonishingly visual. It's a shame these reissues can't include the band's already-compiled singles from this era, because it's in their ever-changing styles that you get the best sense of what he was doing: trying on a joyous fake-jazz strut for ""The Lovecats"", making ""The Caterpillar"" sound like a broken-down music conservatory for fairies, doing bratty, funky synthpop on ""Let's Go to Bed"" and chilly electro on ""The Walk"". Rock bands sound good within the context of being rock bands; pop songs like these carried their own context with them, each one a dream to step into.</p>
<p><i>The Top</i> (1984), however, is not that Cure. Yes, ""The Caterpillar"" is on here, and ""Dressing Up"" has a sexy pop-song elegance that's certainly new. But this full-length is the sound of a rock band stretching out in a much less controlled and occasionally bitter way: There are shades of gnarled psychedelia scattered throughout. Songs like ""Give Me It"" and ""Shake Dog Shake"" scream and blurt with a grim, bristly rage. The band's signature dirges suddenly feel formless and lethargic in a <i>bad </i>way. The rough home and studio demos on the bonus disc are hard listening in spots, but also instructive: In hearing Smith labor to make this material whole, you get a better sense of how the scattershot styles of the album could be stemming from the same source.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Smith was also recording and touring as a guitar player for fellow goth travelers Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees-- which is part of how we get the Glove, a psych-pop side project for Smith and Banshees bassist Steve Severin. This series is kind enough to include a deluxe package of the band's sole, hard-to-find full-length, 1983's <i>Blue Sunshine</i>. With singer Jeanette Landray taking Siouxsie-like leads on most tracks, the sound is about what you'd expect from a Cure/Banshees crossover, or at least one entranced by Beatles psychedelia. (The band's name comes from <i>Yellow Submarine</i>; around the time this was released, the Banshees were enjoying a hit with a cover of ""Dear Prudence"".) For most of the record, though-- ""Like an Animal"", or the Smith-sung ""Mr. Alphabet Says""-- what you'd expect is something fairly great, and a definite treat for Cure and Banshees fans who haven't gotten their hands on this yet.</p>
<p>Then there's <i>The Head on the Door</i> (1985). Saying that this is the Cure's most focused pop album-- with a crucial new band lineup solidified, Porl Thompson's guitar on board, and everyone sounding keen and intent-- might seem like a massive compliment, but that designation turns out to be a bit tricky. The singles here were the band's most straightforward to date: An ingratiating rush of guitar on ""In Between Days"", a jolly twinkling love song on ""Close to Me"", sappy 80s drama on ""A Night Like This"". The songs in between make for the sole 80s Cure album you could think about playing at a beach party-- check the strangely Van Halen-ish sustained chords on ""Push."" And Smith's dreamy imagination of far-away places gets pleasantly touristic: plinking atmospherics on ""Kyoto Song,"" super-speed Spanish guitar on ""The Blood"". It's a tight, terrific package, and more imaginative than albums this controlled usually get, but it's oddly removed from one of the qualities people have always loved best about the Cure-- the deep, sprawling sound of an album like <i>Disintegration</i>.</p>
<p>But then there's <i>Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me </i>(1987), the place where every one of these things comes together. This band is best remembered for <i>Disintegration</i>, yes-- it's the kind of epic, single-minded ""statement"" that asks to be put up on pedestals. Thing is, you don't get the kind of teenage-bedroom devotion this band got by making epic, single-minded statements. In order to get people to dress like you-- to make a whole world out of your music-- you have to <i>offer </i>them a whole world, one that encompasses all of their moods, every waking moment of their days.</p>
<p>The 18 tracks of <i>Kiss Me</i>'s double-LP do exactly that. Every major mode of the Cure is here, and sounding better than ever, each one a realm of its own. There's grand, tormented wailing (""The Kiss"", ""Fight"") next to tender, sunny numbers (""Catch""). There are creepy-crawly Orientalist nightmares (""The Snake Pit"", ""If Only Tonight We Could Sleep"") and slow, sparkling romances (""One More Time""). There are bitter shouts (""Shiver and Shake""), all-pop numbers (""Just Like Heaven""), and complex intersections between the two (""Hot Hot Hot"", ""Why Can't I Be You?""). Smith's lyrics even find, among the usual animals and anguish, a set of linchpin images that reflect in each of those directions. There is a mouth on the cover, and the songs are full of devouring-- both the devouring mouths of desire and the fear of being consumed. Christmas gets to evoke both gaudy colors and sad nostalgia. There's the deep, dark water that would soon be all over <i>Disintegration</i>, and there's an endless romantic push and pull: someone so perfect that Smith asks ""Why can't I be you?"" and someone else so perfect that Smith asks, ""You want to know why I hate you?"" Some of these songs play out mixed-up emotions-- weird crossovers of depression and joy, love and loathing, anger and resignation-- that we barely have names for. Bitter torture and giddy excitement and desire, desire, desire: They all come together into one almost maniacally impassioned thing.</p>
<p>This is the world of the raccoon-eyed, mumbling, moping, endlessly sensitive late-80s Cure fan in one gorgeous, totally immersive package, and it's one of the most convincing, emotionally whole, and individual albums of the decade-- an entire imagined land, complete with sounds, visions, and styles, huge on romance and drama.

    Like Bill Murray, Demi Moore, and Pac-Man, Jason Molina has a thing about ghosts.  In the singer-songwriter's lyric vocabulary, ""ghost"" ranks alongside ""moon"" and ""blues"" in the top three most-used nouns, and in 2000 he named an album recorded under his previous guise, Songs:Ohia, <em>Ghost Tropic</em>.  But Molina's phantasm fetish goes beyond linguistics; often, when his songs, voice, and production are at their best, Molina even begins to <em>sound</em> like a ghost, a reasonable approximation of what folk music from beyond the grave would resemble.</p><p>
    Molina's recent incarnation as the frontman of the southern-fried Magnolia Electric Co. has moved him away from that obsession, as despite the frequent use of the word ""ghost,"" spectral visitations don't usually come with slide-guitar solos.  Since the retirement of the Songs:Ohia alias, Molina's records have become more and more crowded, a progression away from his sparse, vacant beginnings to a more full and collaborative sound.  <em>Let Me Go</em><sup>3</sup>, on the other hand, represents a visit back to those alone-in-the-studio early days, and in doing so restores the haunted to his house.</p><p>
    Or maybe I should say ""haunted mansion.""  While most folk singers go automatically to a production style that screams intimate, aiming to sound like they're sitting right next to you on the couch playing their songs, Molina's solo work emphasizes space-- you might be in the same room, but he's on the other side of an empty great hall.  Rather than whispering in your ear, his voice is all about projection, surrounding you on all sides with thousand-mile echo on ""It's Easier Now"" and ""Some Things Never Try"", proving again and again that meager instrumentation doesn't have to sound diminutive and cozy.
    </p>
<p>
    In their paradoxically rich emptiness, many of the songs on <em>Let Me Go</em> don't settle for simple guitar-and-singing either, with Molina adding touches of piano and wheezing pump organ to ""It Costs You Nothing"", and a tortoise-speed drum-machine murmur to the album's final three tracks.  Meanwhile, analog hiss fills every available nook and cranny, with occasional creaks and studio clatter that will thoroughly freak out anyone who dares listen on headphones in an empty apartment.  Dynamics aren't ignored either, as after eight tracks of post-storm hush Molina abruptly pulls out the electric guitar on the final song, tuned to an awful clanging tone and blurting out shockingly loud string-bending notes in between verses.
    </p>
<p>
    But any successful ghost knows that it's not just the medium that's important in a good haunting, it's also the message.  Molina once again proves himself the master of the opening line, from the thick imagery of the very commencement of the album (""Behind these eyes/ A desert spirit/ Sea serpent heart/ Inside a sunken ship"") to apocalyptic weather forecasts (""The dark outside the world/ I think it looks like rain"") to eerie, desperate paranoia (""Something must've happened to both of us"").  The two songs with repetitive titles (the title track and ""Get Out Get Out Get Out"") come off especially ghostly, the perseverance only strengthening their purpose as either urgent warnings or longings for release, which presumably are the priorities of most spectral beings.
    </p>
<p>
    So is <em>Let Me Go</em> the long-awaited return to world's end folk supremacy for Molina, a retreat from the Crazy Horse fantasy camp of Magnolia Electric Co.?  Probably not, given that its release is timed almost simultaneous to another Magnolia record, and the fact that Molina continues to only rarely play shows without the protective layer of a full band.  But for fans missing the pause-in-the-thunderstorm pregnant solitude of Songs:Ohia, <em>Let Me Go</em> will get you that fix you've been craving, a teasingly short half-hour reminder of his old persona.  Impersonating the paranormal must be an exhausting task, but at least Molina is willing to give us a brief haunting for old time's sake.

    Here's a theory: John Wiese's mechanistic obsessions, his deliberate inhumanity as an artist, explain his need to collaborate so frequently-- with rock acts in particular. Former and current partners Sunn0))), Wolf Eyes, Cattle Decapitation: these are bands who explore sound from the complete other end of the spectrum, wringing sweat and pushing air with big amps and analog equipment. On his own, Wiese will edit his granular, computer-based synthesis to its own death-- literally the sound of a Max patch disintegrating. His act, unlike, say, Merzbow, or Runzelstirn &amp; Gurgelstock's CD packed in shit, is not an attempt to overwhelm the listener. Wiese often doesn't allow for the idea of a listener at all.</p><p>
    His music is alternately seductive and impossible: seductive because it begs you to follow sounds that are entirely foreign, to listen intently to a new language. But also impossible: sometimes Wiese's sound takes over the room, and you want that room back.</p><p>
    So there are few acts more suited for collaboration with Wiese than Chicago noise-hippies Metalux, who build their own wobbly sound off processed vocals and jagged rhythmic bits, garbled and uneven noise from a world closer to our own; they are constantly audible as creators in a way Wiese rarely is. <em>Exoteric</em> manages the magical noise trick of making over the familiar-- the over-heard, the raw and evocative-- into a kind of tangible environment. On the first track alone, the trio morphs vaguely Geography Channel<em> </em>aboriginal mouth-harp boings into something more akin to frogs croaking laser-blasts, turning circles while pedaling on sticky wheels. Together, the detritus of a thousand previously unmade connections form a new kind of whole. 
    </p>
<p>
    Wiese will take sounds that are essentially nothing-- clanking, jackhammers, statics, waves, patterns, phasers-- and bind them into a pounding rhythmic logic that the Metalux girls play call and response with. ""Esoteric Four"" bleeps and moans a super-minimal squeak that repeats ever so imperceptibly, like a really long floor pattern. ""Esoteric Five"" has a middle passage that will play hell with listening equipment, a sub-audible thrust that plays by rattling the speaker cones as much as making sound come out of them. 
    </p>
<p>
    Wiese tells a story about this collaboration. Out on their last West Coast tour, the two women who are Metalux stopped by Wiese's apartment to record <em>Exoteric</em>; they wired up, began to jam, then bam! Faulty connectors shorted, and a lightning bolt burst forth. Something like this, by the end, also happens on record. ""Esoteric Seven"", the final track, is a quiet storm of gauzy tape-slowdowns and tiny stuttering clouds of crunchy static. Metalux throw bolts of distant, semi-tonal exhalations through Wiese's widening circuits and it's genuinely beautiful. These guys should start a band.

    Um, some bloggers have spoken. The medium that may one day be more immediate than whatever medium Pitchfork didn't replace has christened a new band deserving of our appreciation and concern. And that new band is...a jangly Everclear? Die, stagnant rock radio, die, finally, at the hands of the people!</p><p>
    Yeesh. My ears feel like they've been listening to 10 not-diffuse-enough acts, all of them requisitely ""indie"" and marinated with just enough Springsteen to seem congealed. Almost every white-rock sound since the mid-1980s is on display here, and energetically, too. Peter Arcuni's agreeable-emo voice wants to be loved so much that you will feel like a total condom if you don't hop on board their website that only sells girls' tees and the typo-seasoned, teen-rhetoric band-blog. (Google image search these dollcakes for maximum cuteness.) Listen to Arcuni's (literally) heartfelt inhaling! He means those clichés! Check that manly chirrup when he double-means them! I stopped keeping a curmudgeonly list of them after the one about the hand in the cookie jar and the one about at night while the city sleeps and the one about lend me your ear and the one about wanting what was in the store window and the one about you can have it all. Only a petty deskbound wanker would be embarrassed for Arcuni, right?</p><p>
    Joy Division and Radiohead and Blue Sky Studios certainly don't own the phrase ""ice age,"" but Birdmonster settles for treating it like a Jimmy Buffett version of the apocalypse on ""Ice Age"". Which leads to another problem: For a band whose singer is constantly acting like he is freaking out about some intense something or other, Birdmonster's debut full-length hosts a disproportionate number of songs about how everything's going to be okay or alright. In a recent <em>The New York Times</em> column, Aaron Britt argued that ""alright,"" in the context of rock, meant ""sublime"" and not just ""mediocre."" Birdmonster's ""alright"" seems like the latter. They kick in precisely when a kick-in is due, and they break it down at a too-appropriate breakdown interval, and they speak body-movement commands to the dance-club crowd as if they're recording in an expansive, sold-out bedroom. And hey ladies, the ""thing named Rita"" stuff, and the stuff about saving a ""darling"" from ""the dark side of life,"" just reeks of Candlebox's heroic chest hair.</p><p>
    Concession: The dual guitar play between Arcuni and David Klein is unimpeachably graceful and thunderous, even on the derivative dancepunk (ahem, disco-rock) outings. Only the unpredictable Buddy Holly moves on the finale ""Spaceman"" hint that this band has higher goals than to appear on a future compilation called <em>Obnoxiously Earnest Careerists</em>, alongside Rock Kills Kid and OK Go.<br/>

    The ever-tightening vise grip of sampling laws has damaged the careers of
    golden age hip-hop luminaries from Diamond D and Pete Rock to Biz Markie and
    Marley Marl, rendering once-unimpeachable producers ineffective or forcing them
    to adopt styles they shouldn't be attempting. These artists relied on the
    ability to stack sounds both familiar and alien atop each other without rebuke.</p><p>
    P.E.'s production team, the Bomb Squad, redefined what could creep into a rap
    record. When De La Soul was sued by The Turtles in 1989 for sampling ""You
    Showed Me"", thus altering the trajectory of hip-hop production permanently,
    no production crew took a bigger hit. P.E.'s post-<em>Apocalypse '91...</em> output has
    been scattershot to say the least, and though Chuck D's preacher-cum-prophet perspective began
    to wear on listeners, the noticeable dip in beat quality played a huge role in
    the group's decreasing importance. So the idea that someone is looking for a
    remix project reworking songs recorded in their later, lesser period is
    bemusing at best.</p><p>
<em>Bring That Beat Back</em> is not an incompetent or scurrilous work. In
    fact, P.E.'s famed ""Shut 'em Down (Pete Rock Remix)"" stands as one of
    the filthiest revisions ever created. It just happens that this album takes
    some of the few highlights of their post-Def Jam era (""MKLVFKWR"",
    ""Superman's Black in the Building"") and hands them over to either
    less seasoned producers like P.E.'s current beatmaker of choice, C-Doc, or
    veterans like Johnny Juice, whose best days may be behind them. The only early
    period track that gets a makeover is ""Public Enemy No. 1"", their first
    single. It's still my favorite P.E. song and remains as dominating a statement
    of purpose as has been recorded. The remix, by J. Coleman is subtler, relying
    on a jazzy bassline and simple cuts that drain the original of its off-kilter
    synth curls and abrasive mood while leaving Chuck's booming echo vocal as-is.
    It's a bloodless take on a classic. 
    </p>
<p>
    When word dropped a few years ago that Moby would collaborate with P.E. on a
    benefit track, pangs of disgust ran down the spines of most of the hearing population.
    But the thin-on-themes ""MKLVFKWR (Make Love Fuck War)"" was a banger
    in retrospect, thumping with a clipped bullhorn and lacking any of Moby's
    cutesy tricks. Juice's remix shoots for a brighter arrangement, indulging his
    scratching abilities (which are potent) but also painting the track with a limp
    orchestral swoon that'd better fit an episode of <em>Six Feet Under</em> than a
    sloganeering call for the end of all wars. A bright spot is C-Doc's downtuned
    ""Put It Up"" remix. Since the <em>Revolverlution </em>track doesn't have a
    legacy, the song, again reliant on cuts and horn samples, is able to gain a
    measure of dignity. Extra props for the ""Time Up"" samples. It's a
    rare improvement on an album with a mere ten tracks. 
    </p>
<p>
    As Public Enemy's influence lessens by the minute (did anyone pay attention
    to this-year's <em>Rebirth of a Nation</em>, their co-op project with Paris?),
    the outpouring of mediocre projects is doing nothing to reestablish any sort of
    reign. Today's rap themes aren't thoughtless, but when bombast becomes the
    order of the day, it's with regard to swagger on the streets or the dance
    floor. Very rarely does top-shelf, Billboard-ruling rap music feature the overt
    social themes that P.E. flexes. Which calls to mind the question: Where are they
    bringing the beat back to, exactly? Not the masses, that's for certain.

    I introduced myself to John Darnielle after his performance at this summer's Pitchfork Music Festival, and this conversation happened:</p><p>
    Darnielle: Have you heard the new album?<br/>
    Me: Yeah, I just got it.<br/>
    Darnielle: What do you think?<br/>
    Me: I've only heard it a couple of times; I'm still processing.<br/>
    Darnielle: Do you have a girlfriend?<br/>
    Me: Yeah, she's right over...<br/>
    Darnielle: I hope she leaves you. Then you'll understand it.</p><p>
    He was joking. I think.</p><p>
    But he's right; my girlfriend is now my fiancée, and I'm not sure I get this record. I sort of hope I never do. <em>Get Lonely</em> comes right on the heels of <em>The Sunset Tree</em>, Darnielle's gut-wrenching 2005 album/memoir about an abusive stepfather. It wasn't an easy record to listen to, but
    the songs had an anthemic roar that united Darnielle with those who've had to rise above their stations, and it all fit together to create something triumphant and tangible. It even had a clear story arc, a clear villain, and even something approaching a happy ending: Darnielle gets out alive, the stepfather doesn't, and the final song, ""Pale Green Things"", is a postmortem remembrance of a happy morning with the man who once made his life a living hell. It was inspirational-- the sort of peaceful, warm reminisce that can only happen once the villain no longer presents an immediate threat, sort of like Darth Vader 
    rematerializing as a benevolent ghost in the closing seconds of <em>Return 
    of the Jedi</em>.</p><p>
    There's nothing inspirational about <em>Get Lonely</em>, and there's no story-arc or clear villain-- even though every song is about one particular feeling. That feeling is a sort of existential dread, the thing that happens when the most important person in your life walks out. It's a complicated emotion; you can blame yourself or the other person but you still won't come any closer to feeling better. So Darnielle doesn't sing about anger; he sings about loss, and in a way the results are as dark and brutal as <em>The Sunset Tree</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    Darnielle writes about all this stuff indirectly; we don't even learn the reason for the narrator's crushing disconnect until the third song, when he finally comes out and says he's lost without her. Even then, he sings his most horrifically sad lyric (""What are the years we gave each other ever gonna be worth?"") as a quick aside. Mostly, he just sings about wandering aimlessly around town, trying to figure out what's going on. Most of the songs seem to take place on cold mornings, and they all involve meticulous descriptions of ephemera: the cracking ground, the vacant lot across from the gas station, the amorphous shapes in his dreams. 
    </p>
<p>
    A few of these songs are narratives, but even those are disconnected slivers of action. On ""Half Dead"", Darnielle sings about spending a morning cleaning his house just to take his mind off things: ""Try not to get caught, try to think like a machine/ Focus in on the task, try not to think what it means."" And on ""Woke Up New"", he sings about the day after she leaves: ""On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time, I felt free, and I felt lonely, and I felt scared/ And I began to talk to myself almost immediately, not being used to being the only person there."" It's devastating stuff, and it has none of the satisfying closure that <em>The Sunset Tree</em> provided.
    </p>
<p>
    The album also further represents Darnielle's removal from his early four-track days. Acoustic guitar is still the main instrument here, but it has none of the stomp-and-scratch urgency of his ancestral work. Sometimes, as on ""Moon Over Goldsborough"", he's on some Streets shit and the music feels perfunctory, like it's just a quick and colorless backdrop to his lyrics. Other times, as on ""New Monster Avenue"", he has a slight and pleasant groove behind him, drums rippling and guitar amiably ringing along. The backdrop of ""Woke Up New"" is gorgeous; there's something Afropop about the ways the guitar and bass intersect. ""If You See Light"" has subtle flecks of organ and horn.
    </p>
<p>
    So<em> Get Lonely</em> isn't musically monochromatic, but everything is warm and light and well-recorded, and it sounds like a self-conscious rebuke to his blood-and-thunder old days. And so does his singing voice, which was once a strained yelp and which now see-saws back and forth between a placid speak-sing and a weirdly airy falsetto.  He hasn't been a young turk for a long time, and now he doesn't sound like one either.

    Legend has it that Chad VanGaalen has written literally hundreds of
    songs over several years of home-recording and busking on the
    streets of his native Calgary. But he'd still be a songwriter of note
    even if his output was limited to just ""Clinically Dead"", the track that
    welcomed us into his private world on 2004's <em>Infiniheart</em> (given wide
    release by Sub Pop last summer). It's his entire oeuvre distilled into
    two perfect minutes: fragile/fearful vocals, cerebral sci-fi imagery,
    threadbare guitar and glockenspiel arrangements, and inventive instrumental
    economy; when its snare and fuzz-pedal usher in the
    panic-stricken chorus, the effect is seismic. The song should've become
    an indie anthem on par with the Shins' ""New Slang"", but <em>Infiniheart</em>'s 19-track sprawl-- marked by
    slumberous drum-machine rhythms and tinker-toy sampling experiments-- made it clear this guy wasn't trying to endear himself to any teen-soap
    music supervisors.</p><p>
    The word ""insular"" gets thrown around a lot when
    describing VanGaalen, but his work-- both his music and his visual art-- doesn't convey a fear of the outside world so much as a fantastical,
    sometimes horrifying re-imagining of it. Like his Robert Crumb-style
    drawings, VanGaalen's songs transmogrify their childish appearances
    into disarmingly perverse shapes. But if we were to judge VanGaalen by <em>Skelliconnection</em>'s opening
    track alone, we'd draw a very different conclusion about him: This
    dude must <em>love</em> Queens of the Stone Age. Following 20 seconds of
    circus-organ noodling, ""Flower Gardens"" explodes into a
    two-minute rampage that, if nothing else, should at least have his Sub Pop bosses thinking twice about putting him on tour
    with James Mercer. Of course, <em>Infiniheart</em> fans can rest assured it's a total
    lark: The rest of <em>Skelliconnection</em> finds Chad VanGaalen being very
    much himself, albeit with less ""Infini"" and more ""heart.""</p><p>
    Although VanGaalen sounds like he could hum Neil Young's
    <em>After the Goldrush</em> in his sleep, his lullabies are in no
    way bound to classic-rock tradition: The spirited ""Burn 2 Ash"" cruises
    on a fidgety snare rhythm and a one-finger organ squelch before
    dissolving into a denouement of psych-folk acoustic plucks, mellotron
    swells, and violin slashes. ""Wind Driving Dogs"" accelerates its cowpoke
    lope into an elated double-time gospel chorus. And even if ""Rolling
    Thunder"" references Dylan's famous revue, its medieval ambience and
    ghostly harmonies define it as folk music of a decidedly more sinister
    nature.
    </p>
<p>
    The modest amount of touring VanGaalen
    did for his first album has made him a more confident singer,
    and perhaps the interaction with appreciative audiences has inspired
    him to open up the more accessible side of his songbook and limit his
    electronic doodles to brief bursts.
    Like <em>Infiniheart</em>, <em>Skelliconnection</em> is undermined by seemingly random sequencing,
    still feeling more like a hodgepodge compilation than an album with a
    purposeful arc; that VanGaalen subverts the poignancy of penultimate
    acoustic ballad ""Sing Me 2 Sleep"" with a closing burst of synth/drum
    spasms  (""Systemic Heart"") suggests a lingering discomfort with the
    ideas of canonization and grandeur. But <em>Skelliconnection</em> still stands as
    an impressive document of VanGaalen's intuitive and inventive
    songwriting, and its best
    songs lay bare VanGaalen's gift for turning the simple into the
    spectacular.

    DJ Quik is the least heralded figure in Compton's
    holy trinity of rap: Eazy-E
    made a name on sheer force of will, while Dr. Dre let bombing sonics cement his
    now-unshakeable rep. But Quik is an enduring figure for subtler reasons. Spinning records and
    making hype beat tapes when he was all of 14 years old, Quik found ways to mix
    the languid funk and squeegee electronics of Zapp and George Clinton with a gangsta aesthetic. Though David Blake, who dropped the ""C"" from his DJ
    name as a pointed shot at his Tree Top Bloods' rival gang the Crips, dabbled in
    criminal posturing, he also had a weak spot for party jams. This is
    clear on <em>Born and Raised in Compton</em>,
    the third greatest hits release for Quik in the past five years, as well as the most consistent example of his strengths.</p><p>
    While Quik's squeaky tone resembles Eazy's shrill chirp, he's always been a slicker, sharper MC. On a number of tracks here he flashes narrative grace as well as fist-pumping braggadocio. The bottom-bass beat and sleigh bells-laced song ""Jus Lyke Compton"" did both and it delivered an odd tale of unity at a time when the media-fueled East Coast vs. West Coast war raged. On the track, from 1992's <em>Way 2 Fonky</em>, Quik notices while on tour that relatively rap scene-less cities like St. Louis and San Antonio bear a resemblance to his hometown. About Oakland he says, ""We did a show up in Oak-land/ And niggaz was kickin' up sand/ To them bangin' ain't nothin' new/ And slangin' ain't nothin' new/ And for every nigga we done shot/ They done shot two."" By conflating regional similarities with biting, he displayed an arrogance that offended few. But there weren't too many hip-hop shout-outs to Denver at this point, so who could really be mad?</p><p>
    The Roger Troutman-inspired ""Tonite"", one of Quik's biggest hits, was thuggish and scandalous but his tone is inviting, a stark contrast to N.W.A.'s. Unafraid of r&amp;b, collaboration, or self-deprecation, Quik-- though gang-affiliated and from one of the worst ghettos in the U.S.-- set himself apart from an increasingly rote pack by doing more than nihilistic hedonism: Even the stomping ""Dollaz + Sense"", a piercing shot at fellow Compton rapper MC Eiht, has a danceable hook and some bars about conciliation. <br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>Born and Raised</em> speaks only to Quik's impressive solo career, featuring music up until 2000's uneven <em>Balance &amp; Options</em>; there's nothing here from his wide-ranging production career, for obvious label reasons. His genial West Coast style extended to artists as diverse as Whitney Houston, Ludacris, and Janet Jackson without abandoning local talents (and oftentimes friends) like 2<sup>nd</sup> II None, AMG, and Suga Free. Quik's best-known work had an immediately recognizable vibe-- heavy on cuts, wobbly keys and funk bass. This has sometimes been a disadvantage for him (see his contribution to Jay-Z's <em>Black Album</em>, the treacly ""Justify My Thug""), but makes for a rocksteady hits collection.
    </p>
<p>
    Quik is currently incarcerated for a five-month bid on charges of assaulting his sister last year, and he hasn't charted a solo song on Billboard's Top 100 in more than a decade. But Quik released an overlooked album, <em>Trauma</em>, last year independently on his Mad Science label and dropped a live album this year, too. Though he isn't the presence he once was on the ailing West Coast scene, <em>Born and Raised in Compton</em> is as strong an indictment of the fallacious coast-labeling of the early 1990s as any album of the era.

At heart     she's a folk singer, possessed of a physical voice similar to Suzanne Vega's     and a lyrical voice all her own. Her primary instrument is her trusty acoustic     guitar, and her loyal band supports her with banjo, percussion, and fiddle.     What set her apart from her peers on those two albums was the technology mixed     fluidly with her traditional music. She and producer Tucker Martine decorated     her earthy songs with ethereal effects: synth cascades, keyboard squiggles, and     the occasional programmed drumbeat. This has been done before, of course, but     rarely to such specific effect. Instead of floating her music aloft, these odd     sonics actually anchored her expansive melodies to the rumble of the real     world.</p>
<p>In the interim between <i>Meteors</i> and her next release, Veirs is     reissuing two early albums through Kill Rock Stars, a stopgap of sorts for     those few fans who have yet to track them down. <i>The Triumphs and Travails of     Orphan Mae</i>, from 2001, sounds essentially unplugged compared to subsequent     releases. Sure, ""John Henry Lives"" marries Danny Barnes' scars of national     steel with a Casio-derived beat, and ""Raven Marching Band"", with its     ominous guitar line, dissolves into a static of dissident instruments. But the     overall aesthetic is barebones baked in a western sun. It's the same     atmosphere-- simultaneously wide-open and constrained, claustrophobic and     agoraphobic-- that colors <i>Glaciers</i>, but here it's in service of a     concrete conceit: <i>The Triumphs and Travails of Orphan Mae</i>, as its title     implies, is a kind of musical picaresque, a loose travelogue across a hostile     American landscape.</p>
<p>Feminizing the Woody Guthrie mythos, Veirs kicks things off with     ""Jailhouse Fire"": ""Hopped a train and headed West/ Free woman     I'm just like the rest/ All the hobos on the train call me a liar."" That     last line is crucial, as Veirs acknowledges the distance between a     postmillennial indie folk singer and a desperate Depression-era itinerant.     Instead of comparing her touring life with riding the rails, she sounds like     she's trying to lose herself in American traditional music. Having noted the     chasm between herself and her subject matter, Veirs applies this self-aware     authority to the rest of the album, convincingly delivering a lament over a     murderous brother in ""Up the River"" and the musings of a wayward     cowgirl in ""Blue Ink"".</p>
<p>Lacking such a cohering concept, <i>Troubled by the Fire</i>, from 2003,     sounds a little scattershot, but it represents a surefooted step in the     direction of <i>Glaciers</i>. Starting with a few patient moments of ambient     noise, Veirs and Martine gradually introduce new sounds into her music,     creating a space where an electric guitar or the combination of cello and piano     can sound otherworldly. She even gets a rock makeover on ""Cannon     Fodder"", a brazenly abrasive protest song that makes you long for a fully     electric album even as you cringe at lyrics like ""Every war is brutal,     stupid, expensive, and mean.""</p>
<p>Despite these developments, <i>Troubled</i> remains a reverent folk album,     with voice and guitar still its main elements and a fiery populism in its     heart. Alluding slyly to Guthrie's ""This Land Is Your Land"",     ""The Ballad of John Vogelin"", based on Edward Abbey's novel <i>Fire     on the Mountain</i>, features a yodeled chorus that's quietly but angrily     defiant. ""Midnight Singer"" concludes the album on an equally quiet     note, mingling country guitars and carnival organs in an eerily erotic minor     key. As with <i>Orphan Mae</i>, it's hard not to read a little of Veirs into     this song. Of course, she's not the title character-- she's far too modest for     that-- but lines like ""Sing inside my heart / And oh mysterious, like no     other song"" sound like her hopes for how her own compositions might be     heard.

<em>Songs From the Coal
    Mine Canary </em>could very well be Cruella De Vil's long lost album, what with Little
    Annie Bandez merging eerie and sexy, warm and fuzzy as sultrily as her
    two-dimensional Disney counterpart smokes skinny cigarettes.<span> </span>Except you couldn't vilify Little Annie any
    more than you could demonize a puppy: Bandez is harmless, taking carpe
    diem to dizzying, exhausting heights, and finding inspiration, perhaps
    a little nauseatingly, in everything.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Little Annie-- who is allegedly an ordained minister--
    has no shortage of other monikers and hobbies.<span>
</span>Sometimes she goes by Annie Anxiety; in lieu of high school she fronted
    Annie &amp; the Asexuals, whom Frank Zappa saw at a New
    York venue and enjoyed, later calling them ""real
    personal and disorganized"" (held-over teen angst becomes apparent on <em>Songs</em>). <span> </span>Myriad job titles include: ""adventuress,"" ""juvenile
    delinguint,"" and ""post modern cabaret queen.""<span>
</span>She's a ""self-taught painter"" and ""multimedia artist,"" painting
    religious-themed paintings of bright saints with halos in the colors of girls'
    dresses.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Likewise, when it comes to music, she's a prolific
    genre-hopper (Reggae! Hip-hop!) and collaborator (Coil!).<span> </span>Produced by Antony (of, and the Johnsons)
    and Joe Buedenholzer (Backworld), <em>Songs From the Coal Mine Canary</em> seeks a coat tail ride on Antony's
    recent success.<span> </span>And while the album is
    mostly cohesive-- while there are, indeed, truly lovely moments, usually
    involving jazzy piano parts-- it somehow still sounds like a collection of experiments. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    This is music for drama kids to dye their hair
    black to after school: passionate and wholly heartfelt, to be sure, but surface-level.<span> </span>Once upon a time, Annie recited words to a weird
    Coil song-- sounding profound, or trying to-- and it's the same with ""Freddy
    and Me"", which is to say, like spoken magnetic poetry. <span> </span>While the smoky snarl of ""derma covers all"" resembles
    deepness, it ultimately doesn't say much.<span>
</span>Boycut and low-voiced, Little Annie croons ""If I Were a Man"" but gender
    swaps less gracefully than Antony's
    warbling ""For Today I am a Boy"": her version seems more like entertaining a flitting
    thought, a passing ""What if?""-- ""I'd be the type of man with a blue-eyed bitch
    at every port""-- than Antony's bone-chilling meditation.<span></span>

    Wait, people actually care about lyrics? Without them we couldn't have the same powerful, personal connections with people who make songs? Okay, fine. Words are important. But screams are better. That's something Cursive frontman Tim Kasher seemed to understand a decade ago, when he ripped out his heart, sewed it on his sleeve, and called it <em>Such Blinding Stars for the Starving Eyes</em>. But around Y2K, a funny thing happened-- he seemed to decide he'd rather his lyrics be understood than his voice be heard.</p><p>
    The result of that millennial crisis was <em>Domestica</em>, Cursive's first concept album, which told of the messy decline of a relationship in stanzas even the tinnitus-stricken could discern. Kasher still screamed plenty, but mixed in were plain-English zingers like, ""The night has fallen down the staircase/ And I, for one, have felt its bruises."" By the time <em>The Ugly Organ</em> dropped in 2003, even his throatiest bray had taken on tone.</p><p>
    For the scream-deprived, the band last year offered <em>The Difference Between Houses and Homes</em>, a career-spanning compendium of B-sides and rarities that had a whiff of posthumousness to it. Now <em>Happy Hollow </em>confirms the death: Cursive's salad days are over. They're officially a words band, more interested in meaning than feeling. And they're celebrating by tackling some big topics.</p><p>
<em>Happy Hollow</em> is simultaneously Cursive's most and least worldly album yet, with songs encompassing both infinite realms (the universal ""Big Bang"") and mundane ones (suburban lead single ""Dorothy at Forty""). All the while, Kasher mixes messages and metaphors, bitching far too much for his own good. 
    </p>
<p>
    The first seven songs kill, but the album's second half drags on longer than a Def Jam debut. Even so, there's still stuff to dig. The single is a surging mass of vitriol- and trumpet-packed orchestral emo, while ""Bad Sects"" is one of the best American Football songs never written. The latter lays down a slow, stargazing groove while Kasher unveils a feathery, unexpected falsetto. It also features the album's consummate lyrics, accessing the spiritual through the quotidian: ""A new recruit, 25 years old/ He joined the habit with a chip on his shoulder/ Some nights he'd proclaim his preference/ But only flat-back drunk on a bottle of Jameson.""</p><p>
    Tales of lost faith permeate the album. ""This is all we are, we simply exist,"" sings Kasher by way of an introduction on ""Opening the Hymnal/Babies"", though it's unclear at first whether the line constitutes an apostasy or just an observation. If you ask the brassy ""Big Bang"" it's the former: ""In a world of entropy, why can't we just simply be,"" goes the song's pivotal line, kicks underlining each word. On ""Dorothy at Forty"", a meditation on hypocrisy in picket-fence America that uses <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> as an allegory, Kasher sings, ""Dreamers never live, only dream of it."" His storytelling may have grown more abstract since <em>Domestica</em>, but his existential observations have never been pithier.</p><p>
    Cursive could be a great rags-to-riches story: Catholic schoolkids purge repressed childhood memories by starting emo band, grow up to be a sort of Hold Steady for high schoolers. But the band's maturation has come in awkward fits, as if forced. Growth is something bands can't force-- it either happens or it doesn't. And even when it works out, people will still say your first album was your best. That's just life. Tough reality, but Tim Kasher will probably write an album about it someday.

    Before his untimely passing this year, Detroit producer and MC J Dilla had established himself as one of hip-hop's most reliable auteurs. ""He didn't overthink things,"" said Karriem Riggins, whom Dilla enlisted to finish the nearly completed <em>The Shining </em>shortly before his death, to the <em>Detroit Free Press</em>. Dilla's knack for intuitive and engaging beats served MCs well: His lucid, live-instrument-and-breakbeat-intensive production is synonymous with socially conscious rap's 1990s heyday-- a milieu on which Dilla left huge footprints with production credits on staples like the Pharcyde's <em>Labcabincalifornia</em>, A Tribe Called Quest's <em>Beats, Rhymes and Life</em>, and De La Soul's <em>Stakes Is High</em>.</p><p>
    Yet his prevailing focus on soulful, dynamic listenability instead of jazzbo hokum (let us pass over Common's <em>Electric Circus </em>in silence) instilled a durability in his music that allowed it to survive the seismic shifts in aesthetics that rocked hip-hop over the past decade. Despite the erratic quality of his own group Slum Village's output, Dilla's consistently sharp production kept the flame alive for the soul-jacking, pop-friendly rap that would enjoy a resurgence with recently influential records by Common and Kanye West.</p><p>
    A good hook, in other words, never goes out of style, and in a rap climate broad enough to allow for everything from deep-space funk to minimal snap music, Dilla's classicism acts as a control group amid more exotic strains. His other 2006 release, <em>Donuts</em>, with its profusion of brief instrumentals, was his record for heads-- a glorified beat tape that put the raw stuff of his vision on enticing display. In contrast, <em>The Shining </em>is more of a general audience record, by virtue of its song-length tracks and pervasive vocals from Dilla and his crew. As such, it presents challenges that <em>Donuts</em> didn't. 
    </p>
<p>
    On a beat tape, you can make your point in a few bars and move on to the next boom-bap, but an album wants structure and continuity. Dilla imposed this structure upon <em>The Shining </em>by<em> </em>two primary methods, with varying levels of success. The first was by cultivating a sense of unified variety, and this is where <em>The Shining</em> truly excels-- it's a great digest of Dilla's various moods and modes. We get sumptuous neo-soul: ""Love"" recreates the Impressions' ""We Must Be in Love"" as a crackling swoon punched up with hearty brass, while ""Baby"" uses sped-up infant samples as bold, primary-color accents for its supple pastels. We get vertiginous, Madlib-esque fire: ""Geek Down"" weaves a sinister net of thunderclap drums, weird wavering bass, demonic incantation, and a dominant line like a sliced-up kazoo; the rock-solid stomp of ""E=MC<sup>2""</sup> radiates as variegated vocoder textures swell and decay. And we get straight-up trunk-rattle: ""Jungle Love"" laces wowing sirens over skeletal trash-compacter percussion, while ""Body Movin'"" carves up a cymbal-heavy wash with off-kilter squelch and abrupt vocal drops. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>The Shining</em>'s second layer of structural integrity resides in the guest vocals that dominate the album. Many of the record's guests also rose to prominence in the 1990s, though none of them remind us how much hip-hop has changed since then more starkly than Busta Rhymes: The guy who once had one of the most bugged-out flows in rap squanders ""Geek Down"" with thuggish, boring ad-libs that pay homage to the ""fucking godfather Dilla"" while contradicting the essence of his playful spirit. Common fares a bit better on ""E=MC<sup>2""</sup>, dropping innocuous party raps into the tight slots between the scratches and drums. He's equally passable sparring gently with the always sublime D'Angelo on ""So Far to Go"", which sports the sort of inventively dreamy yet perfectly coherent landscape Dilla also showed off on Steve Spacek's ""Dollar"", reminding us that the producer was as good with r&amp;b atmosphere as he was with rap thwack (he makes Dwele sound way better than he has any right to on the ""Dime Piece"" remix). MED and Guilty Simpson spit nails that are well-suited to the junkyard jangle of ""Jungle Love"", while Black Thought mounts a commanding presence amid the overlapping click-tracks of ""Love Movin'"". Dilla embeds his own utilitarian rhymes in the deep digital swirls of ""Won't Do"", and while they don't add much force to the track, they pretty much stay out of the way. 
    </p>
<p>
    Staying out of the way was one of Dilla's assets-- one hears his productions, first and foremost, as songs, not as stylized renditions of his brand. This is why his music is at once so enduringly listenable and why it never fully cracked a mainstream obsessed with personality and trademarked tics-- Dilla's trademark was self-effacement in the service of the groove. The mainstream wanted him, but he mostly didn't want <em>it</em>, preferring to work with friends and kindred spirits, admitting as much with the sample that closes out ""Baby"": ""How do I feel about radio hip-hop? I think it's wack. Most of the shit they play is straight garbage."" Whether or not one agrees with the sentiment is beside the point in the context of <em>The Shining</em>-- it's simply an expression of Dilla's steadfast commitment to his own vision amid the shifting tides of rap culture at large.

    When the topic is Wooden Wand (aka singer-songwriter James Toth) the discussion has almost invariably centered first upon his superhuman productivity. And for good reason--as a solo artist and with his regular tribe the Vanishing Voice he has released somewhere upwards of eight album-length works in the past two years. On these records Wooden Wand has shown indications that his music's chameleon-like versatility might just match its sheer abundance, drawing elements of free-form Martian blues, fractured jazz, and loner folk into his genre-gobbling transmissions. So in a sense it should come as little surprise that on <em>Second Attention</em>, his first album with his new backing group the Sky High Band, Toth has made yet another distinct stylistic leap, this time to craft what is --at least by his far-flung standards-- his most accessible and song-oriented collection to date.</p><p>
    For his Sky High Band, Toth has enlisted the aid of musicians like Glenn Donaldson (Thuja, Blithe Sons) and Shayde Sartin (Skygreen Leopards), both of whom have strong connections with Wooden Wand's spiritual kinfolk in the Jewelled Antler Collective. The appearance of these accomplished psych-folk pilgrims might leave one to expect a full-blown communal freakout, but in fact the results are much the opposite. Instead, the Sky High Band appears fully content to remain in the background, providing the coastal prairie scenery for Toth's unhinged gospel-blues and starry-eyed cowboy anthems.</p><p>
    The closest precedent for <em>Second Attention</em> in Wooden Wand's back catalog is his 2005 solo album <em>Harem of the Sundrum and the Witness Figg</em>. On that release, however, Toth often sang his lonesome, backwoods folk in a spirited mumble/whisper reminiscent of Skip Spence or David Crosby at their most dissolute. But on <em>Second Attention</em> Toth's still-quirky vocals are placed confidently front and center, and his loopy drawl at times sounds like Robyn Hitchcock channeling the wanton spirit of Doug Sahm. Recorded live in San Francisco on vintage equipment, these performances have an animated, one-take-only freshness that allows Toth's burgeoning talents as a traditional songwriter and wordsmith to achieve our full attention.
    </p>
<p>
    As titles like ""Crucifixion Pt. II"" and ""Madonna"" indicate, the songs on <em>Second Attention</em> are replete with New Testament references, although Wooden Wand's lyrics are usually abstract enough to cloud what his actual religious intentions might be. Some of these references seem to be made as much for rhyming convenience as anything (""Lazarus, come and gather us,"" sings Toth on the driving apocalyptic blues ""Hot Death"") but tracks like ""Portrait in the Clouds"" and ""Madonna"" have an outwardly earnest country-gospel swing to their shoulders. ""God's portrait in the clouds/ I am bloodthirsty no more,"" Toth proclaims on the former, while the Sky High Band gather around the mic in their Sunday best before somebody lets fly with a delirious, tube-glowing guitar solo. 
    </p>
<p>
    There's different forms of worship happening on tracks like the gleefully pagan Sun Studio-style hop ""Rolling One Sun Blues"" or the inscrutable cinematic narrative ""Sweet Xiao Li."" Yet throughout <em>Second Attention</em> Wooden Wand and the Sky High Band are able to infuse his dim prophecies with an obvious delight for the surreal and a general sense of cosmic optimism, such as on the wistful closer ""Los Angeles Manna,"" when he rapturously envisions ""dogs in the house of God"" and ""A baby...born from thin air."" These imaginative flourishes allow Toth to continue to claim new ground while still managing to sound resolutely like himself, a nifty arrangement that seems a good omen for what are likely to be his numerous expeditions to come.

    In 2005, as a part of Temporary Residence's Travels in Constants series, Explosions in the Sky released <em>The Rescue</em>, an eight-song ""mini LP"" (their words) that condensed the band's normally epic sound into smaller, bite-sized nuggets. Several months later, Mogwai released <em>Mr. Beast</em>, their fifth album, and surprised fans when no song crossed the six-minute mark. This, from a genre where anything under eight minutes feels short. These albums show that tension can exist within the confines of each riff and melody, not just the song as a whole. Continuing this trend, San Marcos, Texas natives This Will Destroy You's debut LP <em>Young Mountain</em> proves that when the mood is there, it doesn't need 15 minutes per song to develop.</p><p>
    Much like Explosions in the Sky and Mono, This Will Destroy You use their instruments expertly to create a brooding anxiety that threatens to erupt at any moment. They often build in traditional instro-post-rock fashion, starting calm before growing to a dense wall of guitars and cymbals, but they never really feel bound by that formula. The opening track, ""Quiet"", is more about repetition than evolution, as once the instruments kick in early in the song, they don't spend much time further developing the melody. That's not a bad thing, though, because the atmosphere is there, hidden beneath the swirling guitar noise.</p><p>
    But mostly this is an exercise in controlled arrangements. The band employs its fair share of effects, especially delay and reverb, but rarely does the noise spiral out of control. ""I Believe in Your Victory"" bucks this trend, exhuding a more triumphant and upbeat spirit. All of the foreboding elements are still there, but a slight shift in the melody makes all the difference. ""Grandfather Clock"" also sets itself apart, this time with a skittering electronic beat that flutters behind the guitars and keys up front. These two tracks offer a brief respite from the bulk of the album, which is dark and intense.
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, the disc ends far too abruptly. At a scant 36 minutes, this feels more like an EP than an LP. Given that Magic Bullet's release is actually a reissue of what the band self-released last year, I can't help but wonder if another song or two wouldn't have strengthened it. After all, if you're going to call your band This Will Destroy You, you damn well better. As it is, I feel like they've only delivered the initial blows.</p><p>

    It's not like an Elephant 6 membership card ever got you
    instant groupie sex, champagne-room VIP bottle service, and free Gucci swag
    bags, but the association has served Martyn Leaper well. Without his connection
    to the Apples in Stereo's Robert Schneider, the reliable but understated brand
    of Ray Davies-inspired pop he creates in the Minders could very well have been
    lost in the mid-90s lo-fi cassette avalanche. Leaper's songbook displays the
    requisite knowledge of the Kinks/Beatles catalogs required of all E6
    applicants, but as the lone Brit in the collective, he's always been a bit of
    the odd man out-- his songwriting as plaintive as his peers' was whimsical.<em> </em></p><p>
<em>It's a Bright Guilty World </em>is a typically unassuming
    affair, falling softly somewhere between the concision and clarity of <em>Face
    to Face</em>-era Kinks and the in-the-bedroom immediacy of Elliott Smith's <em>X/O</em>.
    Schneider plays a key supporting role on lead guitar and keyboard, but his
    mischievous exuberance and fuzzed-up production style are reined in until the
    coda of track 12, ""357"", where the song's sitar-like guitar riff
    yields to an encroaching parade of booming bass drums. And though violins,
    electric guitar solos, organs, and horns make effective periodic appearances, <em>It's
    a Bright Guilty World</em> is first and foremost a showcase for Leaper's simple
    songwriting: direct glad/sad/mad emotions, breezy, unfussy melodies, linear
    acoustic arrangements, verse/chorus/verse/chorus and out.</p><p>
    Which is to say, <em>It's a Bright Guilty World</em> is only
    as spirited as its performances, of which revved-up power-pop pleasers
    ""Accidental Joy"" and ""Same Time, Same Place"" (written by
    former Remy Zero drummer Louis Schefano and featuring the all-too scarce
    backing vocals of partner Rebecca Cole) are the most engaging. But
    Leaper is a more captivating vocalist when he's not making nice: the
    exceptional ""Jenny"" introduces a welcome sense of tension and urgency
    (""You love to see me down, don't you Jenny"") that distinguishes
    itself from the Minders' more congenial fare, and ""In the Middle of Your
    Love"" is a striking, solitary piano piece haunted by subliminal Mellotron
    swells. 
    </p>
<p>
    Such glimpses into Leaper's heart of darkness (or, rather,
    heart of dimness) are few and fleeting. Where fellow second-generation E6
    survivors Of Montreal stay true to the collective's playfully anarchic vision
    even as they incorporate more contemporary electro/disco elements, the Minders
    exist in a state of splendid isolation from the modern world, a proudly
    introverted feeling that permeates Leaper's modest songs. ""This time is
    going to pass me,"" he laments on the militaristic psych-pop march
    ""Red Admirals"", but he doesn't sound like he's in a rush to get off
    his sofa and play catch up.

The band's third album, <em>The Body, The Blood, The Machine</em>, conjures an America piloted by some sort of Christian-fascist regime (""They'll pound you with the love of Jesus...They'll own your days/ They're only God's babies/ They follow, they know""), and traces the frantic, fiery flight of an ex-pat and his girl (""I can see she's afraid/ That's why we're escaping/ So we won't have to die, we won't have to deny/ Our dirty God, our dirty bodies""). <em>The Body</em>'s story is just vague and gruesome enough to be weirdly terrifying, totally Orwellian, and grander, louder, and more electrifying than anything the Thermals have spit out before.</p><p>
    Original drummer Jordan Hudson ditched the band in 2005, meaning that during the recording of this album guitarist/vocalist Hutch Harris and bassist Kathy Foster were twitching for three, bouncing around from instrument to instrument, filling in the gaps, injecting percussion, keyboards, organs, bass, and plenty of guitar into their lo-fi basement punk. Produced by Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty, <em>The Body</em> is appropriately reminiscent of the Thermals' previous two full-lengths, but far more ambitious in narrative and sound-- the production is cleaner, Harris' vocals are less prickly and more impassioned, and every slammed chord soars. Both in theory and execution, <em>The Body, The Blood, The Machine</em> hits like a less playful, less suburban <em>American Idiot</em>, its apocalyptic, heavily religious iconography conveniently layered over pounding, Ramones-style pop-punk.</p><p>
<em>
    The Body</em>'s unrelenting lyrical gravity is also its single biggest strength-- this isn't the first time the Thermals have gotten political (on 2004's <em>Fuckin' A</em>, Harris bleakly instructed us to ""Pray for a new state/ Pray for assassination""), but, from the opening organ chord of ""Here's Your Future"", it's clear that this is the band at its most somber-- when Harris seethes ""So here's your future!"" a few beats after inciting ""the new master race,"" it's impossible not to feel like you should transfer all the energy you'd usually waste pogo-ing around your living room into scrawling letters to elected officials.  ""Returning to the Fold"" employs a classic post-grunge melody, Harris' big, punchy wails poking through his guitar-web like it's 1994 and you're watching ""120 Minutes"" in your parents' basement. ""St. Rosa and the Swallows"" is a thorny ode to escape (""Passing the corners, we kissed in the rain/ Passing the old rusted warning signs/ What did they say?/ I think they said run!""), while closing cut ""I Hold the Sound"" is spare and weirdly engrossing, the closest the band comes to recreating the impossible catchiness of ""No Culture Icons"", before bowing out in a haze of feedback.</p><p>
    Foster's drums and Harris' weird vocal syntax (which contains echoes of the Mountain Goats' John Darnielle) are nicely propulsive, and <em>The Body, The Blood, The Machine</em> cuts off before it runs the risk of getting too repetitive. But the results of its 38 minutes are still chilling. Harris' imagined landscape is severe and grisly, leaving us all to sprint for cover, curling under desks, hands over heads, fingers crossed: These tracks land like bombs.<br/></p></div>"|9328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9328-the-body-the-blood-the-machine/|8.5|Amanda Petrusich

    On ""Disappear"", My Brightest Diamond, aka Shara Worden, sings, ""I don't think we're meant to stay here very long."" Given her penchant for high drama and brooding atmospheres, it could be read as a bout of fatalism. But, on her debut, Worden is practically obsessed with the ephemeral, acquiescing that love, life, and beauty are as fleeting as songs. Like many card-carrying aesthetes, she focuses on isolated moments in which innocent fascination and something much darker collide. And like a collector preserving her specimens, she runs a pin through these memories to anchor them, whether observing a dragonfly struggle in a spider web in ""Dragonfly"", discovering a dead robin in the backyard in ""The Robin's Jar"", or lying in the crook of a lover's arm in ""Golden Star"".</p><p>
    Musically, <em>Bring Me the Workhorse</em> blends the artsy end of indie rock with classical touches. On the one hand, My Brightest Diamond sounds like an indie band, with its tasteful but precise rhythm section and Worden's tough, distinct guitar playing. But, throughout, strings take a central role in the composition of the songs; they're woven into the songs' fabric, rather than added as decorative post-production flourishes. Coupled with Worden's operatic voice-- which ranges from a sinister growl to a glassy delicacy-- the accomplished, graceful music places her closer to the avant-pop of Antony and the Johnsons than a typical Asthmatic Kitty pop-kid troupe.</p><p>
    The songs themselves can be subject to the moments of unsettling beauty that occur in the lyrics. And, typically, it's Worden's voice that delivers them: the subtle mimicking of a ringing telephone in ""Something of an End""; the piercing vocal that soars during the chorus of ""Golden Star""; the husky torch-singing of ""The Good &amp; the Bad Guy"". At the album's center, ""We Were Sparkling"" marries these two halves to best effect. With a cool and breathless delivery, Worden recounts meeting someone (a lover? a childhood friend?) at the edge of a river to tie ""pretty things"" to a thread that dangles from a tree. Over fragile strums and harmonics, she weaves a succession of images together like the pretty things on the thread: ""Lipstick and feathers, pieces of glass/ Chandelier baubles and empty bottles of wine."" After exhuming these memories, she whispers, ""I'm afraid to forget you,"" and the music soon swells with a chorus of angelic voices, an eerily tinkling music box and a distant skitter of feedback.
    </p>
<p>
    All of this may sound a little over-the-top-- and it is. There are definitely times when the songs would benefit from subtler handling. But Worden takes herself seriously, and such unapologetically dramatic material will make her a tough sell to indie fans who still hold irony and emotional detachment dear. It is, though, impossible to miss her confidence as a performer and it allows her to tread territory that would make others look clumsy, to string together multiple moments of beauty.

    These are fertile times for apocalyptic visions, and it appears that
    electronic duo Wasteland have designed the grim-faced <em>All Versus All</em>
    accordingly. The project is the long-running collaboration between London's DJ
    Scud and NYC's I-Sound, and <em>All Versus All</em> is their fourth and most
    vividly dynamic release. And though the album contains lingering echoes of the
    dubstep and Ambush-style hardcore they're known for, here they nudge their
    sound further towards scorched-earth experimentalism and free improvisation, as
    potent, near-subliminal beats are gradually overtaken by dark alkaloid clouds
    and shadowy noise.</p><p>
    Which is not to say that I-Sound and DJ Scud have lost their knack for
    deceptive, captivating songcraft. Throughout tracks like the prowling
    ""Mavericks"" or the aptly named ""Enticer,"" translucent
    snatches of melody briefly emerge and then evaporate, faceless, back into
    Wasteland's ever-crackling ambient channels. The opening ""Intro""
    rides a mass of surging percussion through a graceful construction of
    high-resolution drones and effects, building in elevation almost imperceptibly
    as it rises through the stratified urban atmosphere. Conversely, the processed
    drones of ""In Strength"" seem to make their slow expansion
    horizontally, moving outward in soft, vaporous billows that can summon the
    filtered, shimmering frequencies of Fennesz or Belong.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, however, Wasteland alternates these more temperate tracks with
    extended passages of furious dissonance. The barely-controlled trauma of the
    title track wouldn't sound out of place on a Wolf Eyes album. Virtually
    beatless, it combines abrasive electronic squalls with sinister aquatic noises
    for a deeply unsettling, broken-levee impact. Though more traditionally
    structured, ""Himmel"" bends tortured snatches of jazz trumpet into
    clipped interjections that sound like the desperate sonar blips of a grounded
    submarine, its distant repetitions continuing on helplessly as the piece slowly
    builds to a full-on maelstrom of heat and noise. And the title
    ""Technology"" seems intended as something of a backhanded joke, as the
    track's heavy-lidded dubstep walks unsteadily across a landscape strewn with
    severed vocal samples and fried electronic circuitry. 
    </p>
    The
    most immediately striking aspect of <em>All Versus All</em> is Wasteland's
    restless and dogged invention. Each of these tracks exhibits great attention to
    detail, but they also seem to unfold as real-time events, with every minute
    aspect of the music's structure open to continual alteration and improvisation.
    This is especially true of album finale ""Hold Out"", on which the
    song's stately, elegant hook is revealed with an overriding patience, allowing
    its sinuous dub to bottom-out into silence while periodically cutting the track
    with dry, chemical-burn synths. It's compelling stuff as apocalyptic forecasts
    go, and ultimately rather optimistic in tone. For even within the harsh,
    degraded environments of <em>All Versus All</em>, Wasteland prove able to
    illustrate the tenacious persistence of life and the human imagination.</div>"|9290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9290-all-versus-all/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

    know which way the gloom blows. There's even a round or two of throat-rent
    Casablancas on the surprisingly romantic ""Stop Your Bleeding"", while

    in a way that pleasantly betrays its origins far from the potentially
    stultifying self-consciousness of the only city that really matters, even as it
    bitterly mocks your ""fashion drugs"" and too-cool silence. ""One
    time we believed, but now it's passing and cliché,"" Jeffares' deep voice
    tells me, ""And she'll say anything to make you move again.""
    Fuzz-bass-smoked ""Between the Rent and Me"" cuts closer: ""What do
    you think I am/ Or do you think at all?""</p><p>
    The haunting chill that pervades such easeful deaths as ""My Murmuring
    Darling"", the arms-crossed stomp that distances dance-rock revival
    revivifications like ""Black Eyes""-- they're just an enjoyable front,
    see, like Orr's stupidity in <em>Catch-22</em>. Pretty soon guitars cry out for
    grease and Jeffares cries out for change and before proper cynicism can be
    mustered for a track called ""Kill the Power"" it turns out, shit,
    dude's been getting all political. When <em>Anti-Anti</em> isn't calling a poseur
    a poseur, it's just as likely to call a bloodthirsty motherfucker a bloodthirsty
    motherfucker. Slow, harmony-bloodied ""Victim Card"": ""We've been
    losing for quite some time now/ Across desert sands and across the land.""
    Elsewhere, nervous head-nodders could easily miss ""the only thing to
    fear,"" as told on TV in paranoid ""Counterfeit Rules"".

<p>
    Everybody knows that bashing Bush and/or hipsters is the surest ways to
    boost page views, but <em>Anti-Anti</em> isn't that obvious, and Snowden don't
    stop there. If the album's dour dance party eventually grows a tad monotonous,
    finale ""Sisters"" spells out a different direction, all squeaky frets,
    lo-fi hiss, and double-tracked falsetto, like Jeff Buckley fronting <em>XO</em>-era
    Elliott Smith. ""So many ways to break a man/ And one is not to touch him
    at all,"" Jeffares moans. The original Snowden taught Yossarian that man is
    matter-- kill us and we're dead. It's OK for stylish post-punk to matter, too,
    and <em>Anti-Anti</em> does so without forgetting to be fun.

    In the whiskey wake of last year's <em>Donkey Stock</em> EP, British quintet Absentee extend their louche Silver Jews twang and lush 1960s pop shuffle to <em>Schmotime</em>, a debut album of deceptively vulnerable songs about banging, boozing, and the weird bootleg chemistry of the whole boy/girl/bed gestalt. Beerlight punk'd baritone Dan Michaelson undermines his macho-ironist pose with subtle sissydom which, along with sharp tunes and still sharper wit, creates a tension that makes <em>Schmotime</em> more than just another indie-country-rock moper.</p><p>
    Absentee would gladly let you believe that Michaelson's a Hemingway-grade misogynist asshole, down to un-British drunken drawl. ""Will you be there/ If I leave her for you?"" he ponders on opener ""More Troubles"", gutted by guitarist Babak Ganjei's barbed Malkmusisms. But drummer Jon Chandler kicks in with the ""Be My Baby"" beat, horns waft woozy with Spectorian grandeur, and all of a sudden the dude's hair might as well be emo-cut. Michaelson fronts even bigger on ""We Should Never Have Children""-- ""Some people never should have met,"" he explains-- but kids actually sing in the background, so haha. Riotous single ""Something to Bang"" scores the chicks out of 10 and gets an 8 for sloppy effort. ""I'm an animal/ And you're an animal, too,"" Michaelson cunningly reminds on ""Weasel"".</p><p>
    Imagine peeling off David Berman's beard and finding Stuart fey Murdoch. If feelings are taken as weakness signs, that's just another reason men drink, but Michaelson's got a surprisingly decent bead on his feminine side. ""I'm tired of being a man,"" Michaelson admits moments before ogling some boobage. Feminine sidewoman Melinda Bronstein edges off his macho bluster with graceful backing vocals, as if the girl-group rhythms weren't enough. ""You Try Sober"" tries on Loretta Lynn's nightie (don't come home a-drinkin', hon), while ""Duck Train"" finds Michaelson imploring, ""You're the only one I want."" By closer ""Treacle"" Absentee are waxing silly on the infinite sweetness of love, but check the title. 
    </p>
<p>
    Much of <em>Schmotime</em> reenacts one of the oldest farces in the mating game: the sensitive man's misguided attempts to come off dickhead to get women. In the meantime, the buoyant brass and plaintive pop shine through the cigarette-cloud bar-howdy, even if the arrangements occasionally melt together in the haze, and ""Truth is Stranger Than Fishin'"" is as tenuous as it sounds. Dark humor gets through his deep-down scared-shitlessness; on the remarkable ""There's a Body in a Car Somewhere"", he imagines the police taking samples of his dead lover's teeth and hair. Unsure whether to laugh or cry, Michaelson wonders: ""Is it not enough to have lived and to have loved?"" I'll get back to you on that.

From there, ""Your Old Street"" shifts gears,     transforming into an upbeat pop number with vibes twinkling over bubbly keys, completing the most     intricate arrangement on <i>Kill Them With Kindness</i>. Sadly,     the rest of the album fails to live up to that song's promise.</p>
<p>On one hand, such eclecticism makes for a rich album, as the band slips     from sunny, straightforward pop into slower, less immediate material. There's a wealth of ideas between Fein and <span class=""postbody"">Wraight</span>-- the bouncy ""TV"" rubs elbows with the skewered rhythms and organ drone of     ""Songy Darko""-- but over the course of the album's 14 songs, the     diversity undermines any sense of coherence. Instead of a singular aesthetic, <i>Kill     Them With Kindness</i> splinters into genre exercises and referential     production values. It's all too easy to hear Grandaddy in the slow, melodic     building and arpeggiator flourishes of the outro to ""Signs Point To Yes     (But Outlook Not So Good)"". And it sounds like the band had the New     Pornographers stuck in their heads when the recorded the saccharine harmonies     and predictable hooks of ""Lions"". Likewise, ""Pity City"" is     every bit the emo anthem its title suggests. As Wraight whines that he's     ""just a stupid boy who falls apart,"" it borders on parody.</p>
<p>When <i>Kill Them With Kindness</i> works it's because of Fein and Wraight's keen attention to     melody and the way their voices complement one another and inject these songs with warmth     and emotion. Unfortunately, <i>Kill Them With Kindness</i> never follows the     statement of purpose that opener ""Your Old Street"" assuredly     outlines. Instead, the songs on Headlights' debut seem pulled in too many directions, often recalling the work of more accomplished indie rock contemporaries but rarely distinguishing the group itself.</p></div>"|9139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9139-kill-them-with-kindness/|6.7|John Motley

    Outkast have never made the same album twice, and each new one requires that
    you go to the mountain your own damn self. Most contemporary rap albums are
    indigestible because they’re too damn long, but Big Boi and Andre 3000's full-lengths require
    <em>effort</em>. Their handful of big pop moments aside, Outkast have never been
    about single-serving hooks. Even on their 1994 debut, <em>Southerplayalisticadillacmuzik,</em> these two dope boys in a Cadillac were
    bouncing along the smoothly paved roads of perfect G-funk, their rubbery verses racing toward the horizon, daring you to
    play catch-up.</p><p>
    By the 2003 release of <em>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</em>, Big Boi and Dre had moved into separate bedrooms but
    kept eating breakfast together for the sake of the kids. On <em>Idlewild</em>,
    they’re once again sitting next to each other at soccer games, but this record is still the product of two
    brains contained in butting heads.</p><p>
    It’s gotta stick in your craw when your farewell ends up your ticket to pop immortality and finally gets studio
    cats to greenlight the movie you’ve been sitting on for nearly a decade.
    <em>Idlewild</em> is the soundtrack to Outkast’s forthcoming film of the same name, which means a
    lot of it is only vaguely comprehensible for those of us who haven’t seen
    its parent flick (which, at this point, is all of us). Now, <em>Purple Rain</em> this isn’t. His own wilderness period makes us
    forgetful, but Prince was once one helluva fastidious editor, and when it came time for his film debut, he smartly yoked
    his most outre ideas to nine of his most indelible songs-- all clocking in at
    less than 45 minutes. Outkast-- or at least Andre-- prefers a P-Funk-like mess. But where P-funk floored the engine without fear of
    either the edge of the vinyl or a club’s operating hours, their motor
    was an endless stroke-stroke-stroke.
    </p>
<p>
    But hip-hop’s compartmentalized three or four minutes don’t lend themselves
    to endless vamps. And so where <em>The Love Below</em> spluttered
    through an uncontrollable bout of creative diarrhea, <em>Idlewild</em> is
    overloaded with hooks and ideas stuffed into songs. Initially, it’s
    thrilling in the way that any spectacle is. You admire the creative
    largesse, and there’s no doubt a strong 12-song album here. But at 79 minutes,
    exhaustion sets in by the midway mark, and the whole of the album takes on the
    feeling of someone trying to cap a broken water main. “Too much
    inspiration,” Big Boi ad libs at the beginning of (the pretty great) “N2U”. No shit.
    </p>
<p>
    The breakdown goes like this: The best tracks are the ones on which the two are
    performing together, like the 40-yard-line funk of “Morris Brown”. Opener
    “The Mighty O” marks the reunion-- both men finally rapping again on the same track-- but it never fully congeals. The second best tracks are the nominal Big Boi solo joints, bass-heavy struts
    like “N2U”, or “Peaches”, with its beat like a screen door slapping in the
    wind. And the least best are the ones on which Andre is alone in the studio-- when he decides to play the blues on “Idlewild Blue” it’s difficult not to
    wince. The album sputters hardest when it plays on the movie’s
    Depression-era setting, padded with charmless jump blues and hot
    jazz pastiches.
    </p>
<p>
    I don’t say Big Boi’s tracks are better than Andre’s because they’re the
    most traditionally hip-hop; I say it because they’re more pleasurable, more
    memorable, and funkier. His lyrics are funnier and more biting than the
    hippie-funk simp drool Andre tends toward whenever he stops rapping, and even how he sounds is now more engaging. As
    happy as I am to hear Dre rapping at all, it’s undeniable that his time away
    from the mic has atrophied a natural skill that once outshined the competition
    before he could even vote. Meanwhile, the dips and dives of Big Boi’s
    booming voice just get more nimble with age.
    </p>
<p>
    People who hate on Outkast haters get a lot of mileage out of the fallacy that people dislike the idea of two men attempting to poke day-glo exclamation points through the restrictive language
    of 21st century rap. Mostly I’m hating on the unfortunate degeneration
    of one of my favorite acts of all time. Even having to write a semi-negative Outkast
    review is sad for me. Frankly, I’d rather remove chunks of my
    forearms with a melon baller.
    </p>
<p>
    Talk to you about the future of Outkast? The future of Outkast is either a
    break-up when <em>Idlewild</em> flops or, if it’s a success, a few more mixed bags. Now that they’ve purportedly made a whole movie that
    plays off the idea of their oil-and-water personalities and irreconcilable
    differences, it’s starting to feel like a shtick-- one that they’re
    actively pimping. Anyone hoping for the return of the spark that made their
    great stuff great is, sadly, as big a fool as the kid sitting up nights waiting for
    his folks to get back together.

People love this band's M83-on-Wellbutrin sound for its one great gimmick-- multiple styles of music mashed together
    under digital anesthesia and performed with waiting room Muzak primness. They're the Urban Outfitters of recorded sound: everything chewed up, fed through a ringer, or otherwise
    digested, and handed down two years later to the kids as avant and edgy. Wham, bam, 4.2.</p><p>
    Except Ratatat complicate things by busting mad hooks.
    ""Seventeen Years"", ""El Pico"", and ""Breaking Away"" from their self-titled debut were all
    anthemic and new-sounding enough to hold ears through the album's
    filler. Those songs hinted at great heights (never reached) and
    profound depth (never plumbed to). Listeners probably wouldn't have
    been so patient if Evan Mast and Mike Stroud weren't expert
    programmers, indulging in pretty atmospherics that they seldom dared
    disturb with industrious tempos or outsize dynamics.</p><p>
<em>Classics</em> is more
    varied in texture and tempo and tone than its predecessor. But aside from ""Lex"", a pretty
    obvious ""Seventeen Years"" rehash, and ""Wildcat"", which samples actual
    fucking panther roars, there are no curtain raisers, just a whole lot
    more suggestion. The album downplays the group's flair for booming
    ghetto blaster beats, so now we can actually hear all the styles being
    watered down. ""Tropicana"" almost pulls off ""Magical Mystery Tour"" psychedelia,
    employing jittery string plucks and marching drums to inoffensive
    effect. ""Gettysburg""'s title promises garrisons and battlefields of clay, but the song's galloping beat and ethereal organ are less
    evocative.
    </p><p>
    Many tracks involve atavistic or vaguely ethnic sounds.
    ""Montanita"" flips a deconstructed tango rhythm but a lounged-out
    xylophone confuses things. ""Swisha"" aims for a
    roiling spaghetti Western feel, which is almost exciting. Its cinematic
    quality is no accident. Like the band itself, <em>Classics</em> sounds like it was
    designed to <em>serve</em> something-- a movie or a video
    game or a Power Point presentation. The biggest difference is brow
    height: <em>Ratatat</em> would've sounded great behind a game of Tetris; <em>Classics</em> strives to soundtrack the next Wes Anderson flick. Both
    albums beg for a visual component. This one just assumes applying for a more complex job is the same as actually being more
    complex. <br/></p></div>"|9326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9326-classics/|6.0|Sam Ubl

    Like a surfing cowboy wearing a Nehru jacket, the Sadies' music blends
    elements of country &amp; western, Americana, surf, and garage rock. But
    nowhere in their catalog do these elements gel quite so perfectly as on their
    new live album, <em>In Concert Volume One</em>, which they recorded over two
    nights at Lee's Palace in their hometown of Toronto. That this is a highlight for
    the band shouldn't be surprising. In addition to their wide-ranging musical
    sources, the Sadies are renowned as an electric live act, and <em>In Concert</em>
    is a persuasive argument that the stage, not the studio, is the natural place
    to hang their hats and wax their boards. So of course it's a double album. And
    of course it's a doozy.</p><p>
    The Sadies pretty evenly split the discs between their own songs and covers.
    The first disc features the band mostly drawing from
    all their albums and featuring the austere vocals of Dallas Good. From the
    opening note, the Sadies sound more confident and directed than on their
    admittedly sturdy studio albums, running through lean, fierce versions of
    ""Cheat"" and ""Why Be So Curious?"" and tackling the Band's
    ""Leave Me Alone"" and Bob Wills' western swing classic ""Stay a
    Little Longer"" with excitable energy. It takes them only 30 seconds to
    rumble through ""16 Mile Creek"", and barely three minutes for most
    other tracks. It's a tight set and the only bum number is ""Higher
    Power"", a traditional song they recorded for their album <em>Pure Diamond
    Gold</em>. Despite Larry Good's barreling banjo, the gospel call-and-response
    sounds soggy compared to the crisp concision of the rest of the show.</p><p>
    If the Sadies prove an impressive live band, this collection suggests that
    they might be even more remarkable as a versatile backing band, a pack of
    mercenaries able to compliment a range of guest vocalists while disappearing
    behind them. On the second disc of <em>In Concert</em>, they support some of the
    usual suspects: Jon Langford, Kelly Hogan, Andre Ethier, Neko Case, Gary
    Louris, Jon Spencer and Matt Verta-Ray of Heavy Trash, and Rick White of
    Elevator and the Sadies side project the Unintended. The Sadies give themselves
    over to Spencer's grandstanding on ""Back Off"" and ""Her Love Made
    Me"" and even rev up Verta-Ray's much stronger ""Justine Alright"".
    With Jon Langford they blast through ""American Pageant"" and
    ""Strange Birds"", and Gary Louris does a surprisingly solid job of
    memorializing Syd Barrett on the cover of ""Lucifer Sam"". But the
    Sadies' best collaborator remains Neko Case: In addition to replicating the
    lively desperation of her own ""Hold On Hold On"", they stomp through
    two Roger Miller covers, the spirited ""Home"" and the swinging encore
    ""Jason Fleming"", nicely complimenting her brassy vocals but never
    distracting from her formidable stage presence. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>In Concert</em> ends with a bravado cover of the Mekons' ""Memphis,
    Egypt (Eagle Bauer's Rock &amp; Roll)"", sung by Langford (obviously) but
    featuring the Sadies and almost all their guests. It's one of the set's finest
    moments, not just for the song's headlong momentum or even for its reclaim-rock
    lyrics. Rather, this bravado finale showcases all the musicians catching that
    gigantic riff like it's the wave of a lifetime and shredding the hell out of it.

    DJ Clue might've managed to go platinum once, but the
    history of mixtape DJs who release officially licensed albums is dubious. Guys
    like Clue and Funkmaster Flex always seem to coax an impressive-on-paper lineup
    of rappers onto their vanity projects, but they're only getting dregs and
    outtakes, the tracks and verses that weren't good enough to go on the rappers'
    own albums. And since the albums aren't really mixtapes, they're subject to all
    the troublesome sample-clearance headaches and focus-grouped micromanaging that
    mixtapes always manage to avoid. In short, they're the worst of both worlds.</p><p>
    So it's almost shocking that DJ Khaled, the Palestinian-American Miami radio
    and mixtape DJ, has managed to put out a remarkably consistent album.
    Especially when you consider that his actual mixtapes tend to be
    slogs and that his vocal-drop shouting is almost as obnoxious as Clue's. The
    difference isn't in the rapping; Khaled's guests skew heavily Southern, but
    everyone is still pretty much on autopilot. There are a few exceptions. Bun B
    manages to elevate ""Gangsta Shit"" above a standard showcase for Young
    Jeezy's boring CTE posse through sheer force of will. Twista impresses by
    fitting the word ""antidisestablishmentarianism"" into one of his breakneck
    speed-raps. Kanye West gets back into his irrepressibly egotistical
    pimp-stride: ""Hi, haters/ I'm back off hiatus/ I feel just like you/ I
    mean, even I hate us."" And even after the ""Kiss Ya Ass Goodbye""
    remix, it's still an unexpected pleasure hearing Beanie Sigel and Jadakiss on
    the same track, spitting absolute gutter shit: ""Get serious, I'd gladly
    involve ya moms/ Al-Qaeda Jada, I'm only involved with bombs."" But that's
    to be expected: When you've got a guest-list as long and impressive as
    Khaled's, you're going to get a few good lyrical moments even if no one's
    really trying.</p><p>
    What elevates the awkwardly titled <em>Listennn...The Album</em> is the one thing
    no officially released mixtape has had before now: a consistent aesthetic.
    Miami has always been the place where New York rappers go on vacation, and it's
    also home to the dependably great Slip-N-Slide stable, but lately it's started
    to feel like the center of the rap world. Florida producers like Cool &amp;
    Dre, the Runners, and Khaled himself have developed a style that fully
    integrates some of the best elements of Houston screw, Italo-disco, freestyle,
    electro, epic synthpop, the hard-plastic post-bounce that Slip-N-Slide's house
    producers have been doing for years, and even (sometimes) New York rap. It's a
    strikingly sleek, epic, and versatile approach, and Khaled takes full
    advantage, commissioning tracks from most of the region's best beatmakers.
    Beanie and Jada's ""Problem"" unites buzzing synths with horror-movie
    pianos, and ""Watch Out"" lets Akon get his Phil Collins on over
    streaky Miami Vice keyboards. But the clear standout is the über-propulsive
    posse cut ""Holla at Me"", which slows down a sample from Afrika
    Bambaataa's ""Looking for the Perfect Beat"" enough that its
    oscillating beeps have room to breathe while Lil Wayne, Paul Wall, Fat Joe,
    Rick Ross, and Pitbull put their heads down and ride the beat beautifully.
    Club-rap doesn't get a whole lot better than that.

    You</em>, Jeff Chang called Tortoise a hip-hop band. What might seem like
    craziness on the surface is actually a perfectly logical statement. Like
    most hip-hop artists, Tortoise put groove and texture out front-- and groove and texture
    were a lot of listener's primary obsessions in the 1990s. For a few insane
    years people were actually arguing that the song should be left for dead.</p><p>
    Back then, Tortoise appeared on comps like <em>Headz 2</em> and <em>Macro
    Dub Infection</em>, surrounded by jungle, techno, and trip-hop artists. When
    the odd, oblong, bass-forward grooves of <em>Tortoise</em> dropped in 1994,
    Kurt Cobain had recently, uh, retired. Two years later, it was hard not to
    feel like the band's <em>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</em>-- and a billion
    other things-- had finally killed grunge dead. Premature and bullshit in
    retrospect, of course, but excuse us for getting excited.</p><p>
    So here we are a decade later with <em>A Lazarus Taxon</em>, a 3xCD/DVD box set collecting singles, B-sides, and remixes originally created between 1995 and 2001. Wrapped in beautiful grayscale, the box has a
    definite, if unfortunate, tombstone vibe. Tortoise continue to tour and
    release records, of course, but in many ways they remain emblematically tied
    to the mid- to late-1990s, a time when indie rock remixes were a real mind
    blower and everyone was scrimping for their own marimba.
    </p><p>
    In fact, <em>A Lazarus Taxon</em> is an inadvertent lesson in how indie
    rock has changed in the last 10 years. Onstage in 1996 on the DVD, the band
    locks into its intricate, multi-part music with the implacable faces of
    tenured calculus professors. The wide-eared listening habits Tortoise helped
    to foster remain active in 2006, but it's hard to imagine a sweaty, bearded
    Dan Bitney striding across the stage in a stained babydoll dress any more
    than John McEntire changing his name to Moonchild McFlowerpot or Koala Bear.
    </p>
<p>
    And though bookish indie heartthrobs can now make a mint singing
    about the Cook County chamber of commerce over Steve Reich
    pastiches, Tortoise offered no such easy ins. At their best Tortoise were
    either anthemic or hypnotic; the first disc of
    <em>Lazarus</em> opens with 1995's ""Gamera"", which hits the anthemic/hypnotic
    axis dead center and is still the band's high point and American post-rock's
    most epic 11 minutes.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Gamera"" begins with John Fahey-esque picking so intimate you can
    hear the squeak of fingers on the frets. A beat somewhere between the funky
    drummer break and Neu! builds and crests for a small eternity, finding room for
    both country twang and Edge-like harmonics. The bass modulates constantly between
    rhythm and melody, one of the band's favorite tricks. Much of Tortoise's
    material from this era has a slight drum'n'bass feel, twisted just enough to
    avoid dating itself. ""The Source of Uncertainty"" is dance music played on
    empty tin cans and Coke bottles dangling from twine, abandoning the good
    stuff kids go for like hooks and melody and drawing lines between
    then-current jungle's polyrhythmic motion and shit like Can, This Heat, and
    Miles' <em>On the Corner</em>. You know-- dance music you can't dance to.
    </p>
<p>
    Earlier singles like ""Why We Fight"" and ""Whitewater"", both from the
    same 1995 7"", have the same spectral, late-night quality-- all muted xylophones and lonesome guitars and the hum of
    orange street lamps. Later tracks veer between pure electronica, outright
    jazz, and the band's most rocking moments. In between, 1998's ""Madison Ave.""
    and ""Madison Area"" turn out radically different versions of the same
    material, another favorite Tortoise trick, Jeff Parker's guitar melodies on
    one song becoming puddles of abstract color on another.
    </p>
<p>
    Tortoise were notoriously promiscuous with their own work, a very 90s philosophy that said just because a song had been finished didn't
    really mean it was ""finished."" The best of the box's versions is Nobukazu
    Takemura's remix of the title track from 1998's <em>TNT</em>. A kind of
    jazz-lite take on ""Gamera's"" krautrock groove thang-- complete with Rob
    Mazurek's watery, tremulous trumpet-- Takemura adds a glossy spray of digital
    sparkle, the difference between his ""TNT"" and Tortoise's earliest records
    being something like the difference between computer animation and a
    daguerreotype.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Lazarus</em> also includes two typically bristling Autechre remixes,
    ""To Day Retrieval"" and ""Adverse Camber"", Rob Booth and Sean Brown applying
    their lateral, chattering machine logic to Tortoise's organic forward
    momentum. Missing in action: The whole of 1996's <em>Remixed</em>, featuring
    two astounding Oval remixes where Markus Popp and crew shatter Tortoise into
    a million pieces and then refashion the shards into wind chimes.
    </p>
<p>
    The third disc is given over to the whole of the band's long
    out-of-print 1995 remix EP <em>Rhythms, Resolutions, and Clusters</em>, the
    title of which is perfectly chosen. John McEntire's ""Alcohall"" is a series of
    cymbal crashes, tumbles on his tom toms, stereopanning snare cracks,
    drumrolls, and cowbell fed through an echo chamber. (There's also some
    wooshy stuff in the background, as was the style at the time.)
    </p>
<p>
    Some of the tracks aren't so big on the ""resolutions."" Rick Brown's
    ""Your New Rod"" isolates a Tortoise bass twang and irregularly repeats it
    over a drum machine that sounds like all sorts of leaves and debris would
    fall out if you shook it. Casey Rice's ""Cobwebbed"" sounds a bit like an
    Aphex circa <em>Selected Ambient Works II</em> DAT discovered a few decades
    later in a storage unit out by the highway.
    </p>
<p>
    But it's also on <em>RRAC</em> that Tortoise most live up to Chang's
    hip-hop take. ""Not Quite East of the Ryan"", by Bundy K. Brown, features not
    only a hard, shuffling breakbeat, but Minnie Ripperton and A Tribe Called
    Quest samples, stabbing funk guitar, echoing horns weaving through the mix.
    Only the vibes, which sound more Bobby Hutcherson than Pete Rock, would keep
    an enterprising DJ from throwing an a capella on top. The bonus is a
    previously lost Mike Watt remix of ""Cornpone Brunch"" that doubles the
    already doubly bass heavy <em>Tortoise</em> sound.
    </p>
<p>
    Aside from disc three, the contents of <em>A Lazarus Taxon</em> are
    chronologically jumbled, but the DVD provides an inadvertent trajectory, the
    stern, black-and-white footage from UK rock toilets circa
    <em>Millions Now Living</em> eventually giving way to color clips of the band
    performing a big jazz/world music style festival, the kind of thing where
    men unashamedly wear fanny packs. There's also a great TV segment with the
    band performing (miming?) ""Seneca"" while dressed in matching Devo-style
    janitor's suits and monkey masks for an audience of grade schoolers, lest
    anyone claim they lacked a sense of humor.
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe it's more generous to think of this box set less as a tombstone
    than as a time capsule. It's thankfully a little early for 90s nostalgia,
    and it's also hard to imagine today's Sufjan Stevens or Clap Your Hands fans having
    much time for a band (wrongly) tagged as ""too intellectual"" or ""too austere""
    even in its heyday. Indie fashion may have passed them by-- happens to everyone, and
    many people do their best work out of the spotlight-- but Tortoise are still a
    great band. <em>A Lazarus Taxon</em> might be the best album they never
    released.

While their friends were busy becoming indie rock heavyweights (Mogwai) or fielding record deals from the Beastie Boys (Bis), the Delgados were the responsible ones who woke up early in the next morning to mail out those other bands’ promos-- just one part of their daily duties running the redoubtable Chemikal Underground label. But it’s no understatement to say that without the Delgados’ guiding hand, those bands would’ve been hard-pressed to get heard outside out of Glasgow; remember, this was at the height of Britpop-- Alex Kapranos was just a guy playing keyboards part time in Urusei Yatsura, while London major-label A&amp;R reps were looking for the next Oasis in Wales. But if the Delgados’ fanbase was relatively modest in size, it did include the most important fan a fledgling indie act could ask for: late BBC broadcaster John Peel, who-- judging by this impressive 2xCD, 29-song Peel Session collection-- seemed to invite the band to his Maida Vale studios whenever The Fall weren’t available.</p><p>
    The spirit of the Peel Session-- the opportunity for bands to test-drive new material prior to release or mess around with cover versions-- serves the Delgados’ music especially well, and <em>The Complete BBC Peel Sessions</em> provides valuable insight to their eight-year, five-album evolution from typical Sonic Youth/Pavement-worshipping distorto-rock junkies to soft-rock sophisticates. The first disc shows that the aesthetic leap from the adrenalized noise-pop of 1996’s <em>Domestiques</em> to the highlands pastorales of 1998’s <em>Peloton</em> was not nearly as unexpected as it seemed at the time: from the first session here (actually recorded for a Radio Scotland program before being rebroadcast on Peel’s show), Alun Woodward and Emma Pollock’s signature lilting melodies and wry vocal interplay-- like Steve Malkmus trying to pick up Kim Deal-- were already in full effect; the difference between <em>Domestiques</em>’ “Primary Alternative” and <em>Peloton</em>’s jolly “The Arcane Model” is the latter has less fuzz and more flutes. As Woodward recounts in his winsome liner notes, it was a July 1997 Peel Session-- an experiment with acoustic arrangements and string players-- that inspired the Delgados to trade in noise for nuance.</p><p>
    And it’s the <em>Peloton</em>-era songs (comprising the bulk of disc one) that provide this collection with its most inspired moments, capturing a band hitting its stride and brimming with confidence with each new song; the superior takes of “Everything Goes Around the Water” and “The Weaker Argument Defeats the Stronger” possess a forcefulness that their more reserved album versions only hint at. The Delgados’ next album, 2000’s Dave Fridmann-produced <em>The Great Eastern</em>, was arguably their greatest, so it’s somewhat disappointing that it’s only represented by a single four-song session (though the versions of “No Danger” and “Aye Today” prove those songs don’t need Fridmann’s Bonham-esque bombast to connect). The Delgados would continue on the orchestro-rock trajectory with 2002’s <em>Hate</em> before scaling back for 2004’s uneven <em>Universal Audio</em>, but the second disc here bears little evidence of these developments. As The Delgados’ music grew more serious, their Peel Sessions seemed to get more silly: the September 2002 set shows them to be the rare band that can cover ELO (“Mr. Blue Sky”), Dead Kennedys (“California Uber Alles”), and Cat Stevens (“Matthew and Son”) with equal abandon.
    </p><p>
    However, the final <em>Universal Audio</em>-era session in September 2004-- highlighted by Woodward’s affectingly stark “Is This All That I Came For?” and a stern cover of Ewan MacColl’s “Ballad of Accounting”-- feels almost presciently somber: Peel would pass away a month later; bassist Stewart Henderson would leave the Delgados the following April, portending the dissolution of the band. Though <em>The Complete BBC Sessions</em> is not a definitive Delgados collection-- there’s no “Monica Webster” or “Akumulator” or “American Trilogy” or “All You Need Is Hate”-- it stands as a lovingly compiled tribute to two greatly admired and greatly missed UK pop institutions.

This blogger-approved Toronto quartet has the potential to become a real five-tool player in indie for a long time; Pretty Girls Make Graves' agility, Les Savy Fav's curveball, the Strokes' sweet swing-- there's no questioning the latent talent here.</p><p>
    Strangely, most bands follow a developmental arc similar to those of professional athletes. Just as the minor leagues help hone those nascent all-star skills, there's almost an unwritten rule that bands should become road-tested to refine their power-chord angst into slick, nuanced songwriting. Without even knowing Tokyo Police Club's ages, you can hear the greenness in their excessive handclaps, their ham-handed sci-fi narratives, and their opening alarum, ""Operator, get me the president of the world!"" The band may have spawned some of these tracks from a bored biology class daydream, but when they're on musically, the post-adolescence imbued in their sound doesn't even matter.</p><p>
    For all the raging hormonal awkwardness, the Club knows how to self-edit like the most scrupulous adults. The seven songs here contain no extra gristle, each weighing in around a svelte two minutes. Even tighter are the twitchy micro-Strokes riffs adorning tracks like ""Cheer It On"" and ""Nature of the Experiment"". Frontman Dave Monks even apes Casablancas' vox-via-megaphone a bit, though with more nasal, less growl. The Strokes comparisons only hold for so long though as the EP's second half forks off into Pretty Girls/Q and Not U hyper post-punk and straight-laced emo. ""Shoulders &amp; Arms"" demonstrates the band's ability to pull off the former, a bustling juggernaut of stratospheric guitars and squalling synths. Meanwhile, ""Citizens of Tomorrow"" headlines the emo-minded selections, swelling to a futuristic climax that's three parts Sunny Day Real Estate, one part Sparta.
    </p><p>
    While for now any genre may be their oyster, I hope these guys stick to the prickly garage rock prominently featured early on the EP. Not only do they do it best, but the cushy-sounding stuff closing the release lacks the idea density of the rest of <em>Crime</em>, and choosing to pursue more of this ethereal fluff could result in an overblown LP letdown not unlike that of Rahim's or the Chinese Stars'. Either way, we-- and the rest of the indie rock world-- are waiting and listening for their next move.

    From Pat Boone's <em>In a Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy</em> to the Moog Cookbook to Paul Anka's <em>Rock Swings</em>, we're used to hearing the soundtrack of our teenage rebellions defanged for easy-listening entertainment. But the 2004 debut from Nouvelle Vague-- a collection of post-punk classics simmered down to a breezy, bossa nova lilt-- worked as more than shtick by playing up similarities as much as differences. The emotionally detached delivery of Joy Division's ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" and the Clash's ""Guns of Brixton"" complemented the disaffected coos of Nouvelle Vague's ersatz-60s chanteuses, while both songs' two-chord melodic cadences could be easily grafted onto skeletal bossa nova frameworks. Not to mention that the aching rendition of the Undertones' ""Teenage Kicks"" sounded particularly poignant following the death of that song's greatest champion, John Peel.</p><p>
    So a sequel was inevitable, if only because 1980s nostalgia now seems less like a fleeting phenomenon than a permanently ingrained facet of our musical nomenclature. Judging by <em>Bande a Part</em>'s reverential and well-researched liner notes, Nouvelle Vague producers Marc Collin and Oliver Libaux are obviously in it for more than just a laugh. The track list may contain its share of obvious 80s touchstones, but it also features a handful of obscurities familiar to only the most studious post-punk archivist. And though the versions of the Buzzcocks' ""Even Fallen in Love"" and New Order's ""Blue Monday"" successfully mimic the first album's bossa nova bounce, <em>Bande a Part</em> aspires to something greater than the application of one genre's conventions to another. The arrangements are more richly detailed and cinematic in scope, and the singers are free to wail as much as whisper.</p><p>
    By widening the project's parameters, however, <em>Bande a Part</em> often loses its predecessor's balance between novel and novelty. Where the first record's subdued, sighing performances often meant the source material didn't fully reveal itself until the chorus hit, <em>Bande a Part</em>'s garish rendition of Billy Idol's ""Dancing with Myself"" sounds like a show tune from some failed <em>Post-Punk: The Musical!</em> production, while the staid version of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" is far more Tracy Chapman than Astrud Gilberto. On the other end of the spectrum, the version of Bauhaus' ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" is so evocative of the original's despairing ambience that its inclusion here seems pointless. Perhaps these songs are too shackled to their era to be reinterpreted meaningfully, but the ""Look at me!"" arrangements they're given reduces them to an easy selling tool for attracting thirtysomethings that can afford to drop an extra $14.99 at the Starbucks counter. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's no coincidence that <em>Bande a Part</em> is frontloaded with the more familiar songs, but hopefully casual listeners will stick around for the closing triptych of lesser-known pleasures: a string-swept lullaby take on Heaven 17's ""Let Me Go""; a funereal, accordion-abetted march through Visage's ""Fade to Grey""; and the dreamily seductive closer ""Waves"", a recasting of a song by Brit new-wave curios Blancmange that sounds like the secrets Hope Sandoval keeps when she's talking in her sleep. For a project built on contradictions, it's only fitting that Nouvelle Vague's most lasting work stems from its most forgotten inspirations.

    Rick Ross is a great rapper. Just ask him and he'll tell you. Weird, though: For such a blowhard, we hardly learn anything about Ross on <em>Port of Miami</em>, his lavishly promoted Def Jam debut. If anything, the album proves you can listen to someone expatiate on himself and walk away feeling like you've learned nothing about that person; it is-- not insignificantly-- a paean to saying a lot without saying anything.</p><p>
    Credit Def Jam for an admirable con job. <em>Port of Miami</em> sounds so good, you might be duped into thinking Ross can actually spit. The first line of its first single, ""Hustlin',"" is a fucking beast, the best 12 words Ross ever strung together: ""<em>Who</em> the <em>fuck</em> you <em>think</em> you <em>fuck</em>-in' wit' <em>I'm</em> the <em>fuck</em>-in' BOSS."" Ross accents against the beat, giving the line a free-falling feel. His ""boss"" is the sound of a trillion-pound weight hitting the ground.</p><p>
    But that's about the deepest this guy runs. In a gross perversion of lyric-writing fundamentals, Ross usually eschews the specific for the general. We know he made big bucks selling coke but (unlike Young Jeezy) he glosses over the dark side of black market entrepreneurship. We know he spends liberally and audaciously but (unlike Pharrell) he spares us colorful sketches of his favorite wardrobe items. We know he took a woman home from the club last night but (unlike Lil' Wayne or Art Brut) he withholds prosaic details like how many times they stumbled making it to the bed or what was breakfast the next morning or even, God forbid, what she wore. We never learn for sure where Rick Ross came from, and that prevents us from truly knowing <em>where he's coming from</em>. He's that rare, mythical creature: a rapper without a back story. </p><p>
    As if digesting trap-hop wasn't beguiling enough, here's an album presenting perhaps the starkest gap in quality between production and personality since Puff Daddy and the Family's <em>No Way Out</em>. The first six tracks are absolute titans, all sweeping synths and hypnotic organs and <em>Scarface</em> samples. ""Push It"" flips the same-named track from that movie's soundtrack, slowing the beat to match Ross' phlegmatic gait. Grim, creeping arpeggios lend themselves to opening tracks, and this song's twinkling piano line recalls the menacing string plucks Young Jeezy used to open <em>Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101</em>. The similarity's no accident. ""Blow"" sets gale force tuba farts against Dre's fairy dust hook. To call Ross' verses redundant, however, would be just that: ""Mo' trips (mo' trips)/ Mo' whips (mo' whips)/ Mo' money (mo' money)/ I'm mo' rich (mo' rich)."" </p><p>
    ""I'm Bad"" contains some of the album's most syllabically ambitious stanzas, but also some of its worst stumbles. Which is a shame, because the hook Ross delivers over the song's speedboat bass and sparkling horn hits is legendary: ""I'm bad (I'm bad)/ I'm back (I'm back)/ I'm mad (I'm mad)/ I'm strapped (I'm strapped)."" For a few, thrilling seconds, Rick Ross is Mr. T. ""Boss"" offers a blueprint for a successful slow jam, emphasizing the first and third beat as much as possible without grinding the song to a complete halt. It's the kind of track Lil' Wayne would absolutely obliterate, but Ross fades into the background, overwhelmed by Cool &amp; Dre's euphoric flybuzz synths. ""For Da Low"" might be the record's biggest surprise: a ""jazze phizzle pro-duck shizzle"" with exactly zero (0) sine wave synths. Jazze Pha, probably under instructions to keep the mic away from Ross as long as possible, does a particularly belabored version of his homicidally annoying intro drop. If anything his voice reminds us how bad we could have it. </p><p>
<em>Port of Miami</em> is a case of invention begetting necessity. Sure Ross needs these beats-- he has all the charisma of a cold meatloaf. But they need him all the same. He's a supporting actor, second fiddle to the real, Pro-Tooled stars, desirable not for his authority or presence but for his utter blankness. Def Jam could heli-drop any bozo into such glorious ambiance and score some hits; the album facilitates sedentariness. By contrast, Trina's ""Told Y'all"" is a quicker, snappier production than anything on <em>Port of Miami</em>. No coincidence Ross sounds a hundred pounds lighter in his guest verse on that track from four years ago. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Rick Ross may be bumbling and redundant and charmless, but he's not a disease. Drugs juke and jive with the zeitgeist, in and out of authority's searchlights, and this fall's college freshman won't blow lines or not because of Rick Ross. The fact he can't articulate himself for shit makes him more joke than jailbird. He's simply incapable of portraying the coke trade with Jeezy's glamour or Clipse's fatalism, of making a persuasive endorsement either way. Ross' real danger is the type of effort he countenances for mainstream rap. His girth belies his drive: He's not hungry at all. <br/>

I had taken half a year off to travel alone, and I'd just left London, where a friend had given me a copy of the <em>Birthday</em> EP. I'd heard the single once or twice in passing before, but my first meaningful interaction with it wasn't until later that week, on a nine-hour night train ride from Austria to Budapest. I listened to the whole EP on repeat that night, its brittle rhythms and gleaming synths coalescing with the dark shapes and city lights in constant renewal on the other side of my window, the unfamiliarity of my surroundings giving it all a further resonance.</p><p>
    There are special songs, and there are special memories, but if you're one of those nostalgia-bitten people for whom neither seem quite vivid enough on their own, nothing matches what happens when the two dovetail. The beauty of these moments is they refuse to be architected-- we can't force them any more than we can explain them. And while the Junior Boys aren't magicians, they speak the language of that magic as well as anyone making music today. (In the band's official bio, K-Punk blog's Mark Fisher writes that <em>So This Is Goodbye</em> is a ""travel sick"" record-- I'd go him one further and say that specific sensation of travel sickness is at stake every time they set out to make music.)</p><p>
    Just their second full-length overall, <em>So This Is Goodbye</em> isn't just an improbable notch above 2004's <em>Last Exit</em>-- it's also among the best records you'll hear all year. The first complete album made by vocalist Jeremy Greenspan without the aid of founding member and presumed rhythmic engine Johnny Dark, it finds the Boys (now rounded out by onetime engineer Matthew Didemus) working within comparatively streamlined song structures, the rhythmic capriciousness that so strongly informed their debut all but erased from the whiteboard. And yet, despite this radical formal departure, <em>Goodbye</em> draws out so many of the same sensations and colors that it feels like a natural next step. If anything, the absence of those slippery rhythm tracks puts the focus even more squarely on Greenspan, who delivers with a record full of elegant melodies.
    </p><p>
    Beyond the glowing synthlines, frigid percussions, and Greenspan's marvellously tensile voice (imagine Ben Gibbard with much higher cheekbones), the Junior Boys' greatest weapon is space. With an economical 10 tracks spread out over nearly 49 minutes, the pop in <em>So This Is Goodbye</em> is hardly immediate; instead, its songs are allowed to percolate and unfurl. On paper, especially to the average thrillseeker, that might sound a bit offputting, but it's not like these are all ballads, either. Opener ""Double Shadow"" begins with a gentle pattering sequence of synth beads but blooms into a smartly melodic slice of electrohouse that Booka Shade would be proud to call their own. Elsewhere, with its serrated analog lead, gushy pads, skipping rhythms, and pressurized vocals, ""The Equalizer"" accounts for one of the album's finest arrangements, while the uptempo first single ""In The Morning"" finds Greenspan merging icy r&amp;b with 4AD's warm guitar sounds to beautiful effect. 
    </p>
<p>
    In the end, though, the biggest goosebumps come courtesy of the slowburners. The penultimate track ""When No One Cares"" recasts the Sinatra standard as a wobbly space ballad, closer ""FM"" crosses the finish line in an unhurried cloud of staccato arpeggios and warm harmonies, and standout ""Count Souvenirs"" marries liquefied synths and keening minor-key melodies with the album's starkest imagery (""Empty stalls and shopping malls that we'll never see again/ Hotel lobbies like painful hobbies that linger on""). Finally, the album’s title track finds
    Greenspan singing: ""So
    this is goodbye, no need to lie/ This creature of pain, has found me
    again/ So
    this is goodbye,"" possibly in reference to Dark, or to his departed
    former

While the Wu-Tang Clan ready another reunion tour, many members seem to feel out of place in 2006's hip-hop landscape, as if they're unsure if their style can compete with the modern 50s and Jeezys of the Rap Machine. There's no better evidence of this phenomenon than Pitchfork contributor Tom Breihan's fascinating Method Man <a href=""http://www.villagevoice.com/blogs/statusainthood/archives/2006/07/status_aint_hoo_11.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> for <em>The</em> <em>Village Voice</em> in which the MC speaks about the corroding influence of the music industry on the WTC, ""They just take the flavor out of shit after a while. But people just get used to you or tired of you. I hate to say it."" With patience and skill, the Wu's own ""quiet one,"" Masta Killa, has managed to evade the commercial trappings that have tainted so many of his brethren. After sticking with an in-house, classic-Wu style with his years-in-the-making 2004 debut, <em>No Said Date</em>, he comes back relatively quickly with another reliable nostalgia trip with <em>Made In Brooklyn</em>.<br/></p><p>
    The 37-year-old rapper's entrenched style-- an amalgam of GZA and RZA's off-kilter philosophizing, Meth's blunted-lothario charm and U God's laconic punches-- makes it seem like he's never heard a non-Wu track in his life. Which, of course, is not necessarily a bad thing. And it makes sense considering Masta Killa didn't even start rhyming until he joined the Clan as their final official member in the early 1990s. With a flow diametrically opposed to that other Killah's emotional thralls, he's a steadfast rock whose lack of dynamics prohibits him from royally fucking up; it also eliminates his chances of producing a true Wu pillar.</p><p>
    Considering his limited range as an MC, Masta Killa's beats become extremely crucial. Simply put, the quicker the BPM, the more nimble his flow. And though RZA sits out yet another Wu venture on the production side, contemporaries like MF Doom and Pete Rock along with a slew of young <span class=""postbody"">disciples</span> dutifully fill in. ""Brooklyn King"" has him coolly blowing localisms over old-school NYC minimalism-- just a jazzy drum track and a quick bass run. The faster-is-better maxim also holds up on the horn-funked Rae and Ghost showcase ""It Is What It Is""-- the most electric out-and-out banger-- and the sweet-smelling ""Pass the Bone (Remix),"" a 9<sup>th</sup> Wonder-style Al Green soul cut from Brooklyn producer Jig Sor. Also helping his cause are RZA and especially Method Man, who show remarkably vital signs of life on the stutter step horn pop of ""Iron God Chamber"". With its wealth of stellar collaborations, <em>Brooklyn</em> bodes well for the next full-fledged Wu LP, should it ever come to pass.
    </p><p>
    The album falters, though, when it breaks from the Clan's formula (the canned r&amp;b of ""Let's Get Into Something"", the jolting, out of place reggae closer ""Lovely Lady"") or lags (the plodding, Doom produced ""E.N.Y. House"", the limp loverman track ""Nehanda and Cream"", which utilizes the same Gladys Knight sample Kanye used to brilliant effect on Scarface's ""In Cold Blood"", with lesser returns). Still, Masta Killa's slow-but-steady cadence lingers lovingly on the clipped ballad ""Street Corner"", featuring Inspectah Deck and GZA spitting raw, unflinching pain over mournful strings. <br/></p>
<p>
    Truth be told, nobody in the WTC really fits into the trends and fads of today. The group's no-frills aesthetic defines their legend but it also prohibits their progress. But the Clan's consistency-- once again proven by this solid effort from their least recognizable contributor-- is utterly staggering. Countless rap crews from G-Unit to D12 to Dipset have tried to copy the Wu model only to peter out artistically by the time the third or fourth member drops his solo long player. So, until 40 Cal releases an album as effortlessly listenable as <em>Made In Brooklyn</em>, the Wu's domination as a collective is secure. <br/></p></div>"|9295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9295-made-in-brooklyn/|7.2|Ryan Dombal

Robert Johnson set the precedent. You thought Steve Vai was acting in <em>Crossroads</em>? He's recording a tribute album for displaced Sudanese right this second to try and stave off the inevitable. In the pit, down there, in a room with no light, Django Reinhardt is forced to play non-stop while a drop of water falls on his forehead every other minute, for the rest of eternity. Link Wray is being flagellated with his guitar still in hand, while hundreds of expired Gen-X-ers clamor from all sides, begging him to him play the ""Pulp Fiction Song"" one more time. And Alan Sparhawk can hear all of it.</p><p>
    Calling your record <em>Solo Guitar</em> calls some unfortunate and maybe indulgent preconceptions to mind, but if you recognize Sparhawk's name from his day job as frontman for the infamously minimal Low, all those notions fall away. There's no noodling to be heard here, despite calling one track ""Eruption by Eddie Van Halen"". (Let no one accuse Sparhawk of lacking a sense of humor.) It's a little more like the finale to Low's ""Do You Know How to Waltz?"" stretched for 45 minutes-- and much, much scarier. <em>Solo Guitar</em> has less in common with <em>Van Halen</em> than it does with <em>Drum's Not Dead</em>, as Sparhawk tries to move past where music pokes at well-worn emotional centers within us and starts shifting the physical space around us.</p><p>
    Since it's just one man on guitar (in case the title didn't clue you in), that's quite the uphill crawl. Every note has a precedent, has been played a thousand different ways through a thousand different pedals-- getting a ""new"" sound is hard. But, to hammer a cliche, it's the space around the notes: all the dark, industrial corners of Sparhawk's sweetest Low songs take full court, like the dream of his band evaporating into the blackness of sleep. Any note Sparhawk hits is just to shove at that blackness, pushing it into an interesting corner.
    </p><p>
    ""How the Weather Comes Over the Central Hillside"" starts with a few discernible chords and what almost sounds like a bow hitting the strings, but the fog of distortion and reverb drown out any traces of a corporeal trigger. Sparhawk mostly aims for a sound bigger than himself. Later, the 13-minute ""Sagrado Corazon de Jesu (second attempt)""-- the first attempt being much more brief-- will spiral out of his hands as three distorted notes are plucked, looped, echoed, and eventually pierced by what sounds like high-pitched surf guitar with its flesh torn off in its final minutes. He imitates more recognizable (but no less abrasive) sounds with the grinding metal screech of ""How the Weather Hits the Freighter..."" and the rattling reverberation of ""How the Engine Room Sounds"". The cheekily-titled ""Eruption"" brings it back to man-with-guitar as Sparhawk makes the same spastic fretboard leaps of Van Halen without any of the discernible space between notes. The Low frontman's played disembodied-force-of-nature pretty well thus far, but it's not hard to project a more human smirk on him here. 
    </p>
<p>
    Everything Sparhawk tries is pretty successful with a pretty constrained pallette of sounds, from the screeching of ""Frieghter"" to the more watery Low-friendly tones of ""How It Ends"", and not much in between. Don't play it at your next party, but put it on it if you want to feel something else immediately: like, uncomfortable. Or overwhelmed. Or whatever Sparhawk felt when he thought this needed to be communicated to others. Something big is coming through these speakers, twisting at the most unexpected moments and changing the air just enough for you to notice.

    I haven't read <em>Blood Meridian</em>, the novel by Cormac McCarthy, but it's said to be violent and western. Blood Meridian's <em>Kick Up the Dust</em> is plenty western, a little violent, and full of hardscrabble big-sky anthems captured in shimmering clarity. Smart money blows the whistle here: This is reference porn at its most full-frontal. What's more, McCarthy's grisly tale isn't even the only BM the band name channels. Lead singer/songwriter Matthew Camirand plays bass in <u>B</u>lack <u>M</u>ountain, and you'll recognize that Vancouver band's noirish, dissociative stomp in this Vancouver band's noirish, dissociative gallop. The differences are subtle but they add up: Blood Meridian are more concise and more drinky than druggy. They take no interest in discursive instrumental passages, but they sure love tremolo guitar.</p><p>
    Like Neil Young, Camirand writes laconic lyrics about personal struggle, but he doesn't have Young's humanist empathy. He's the simpler, shallower sort: a guy with a guitar and some problems. Narcissism has its musical advantages, though. Lacking worldly ambition, Camirand has an easier road to hoe. His music never sounds all that dogged or overburdened, the way it might if he possessed a more demanding conscience. His lyrics infuse the songs with a sense of resignation, a contented nihilism that prevents <em>Kick Up the Dust</em> from being moving or profound but keeps the album easygoing and fun throughout.</p><p>
    The album doesn't score big points for originality-- ""Soldiers of Christ"" sounds like a million White Stripes songs, and not just in the vague sense that the bands share the same tradition-- but breaking new ground isn't the m.o. here. ""Kick Up the Dust"" overcomes its plodding predictability by sheer dint of sonics: Like most of the album, it's just so easy on the ears. A towering guitar slides in around the three-minute mark, sounding as sultry and soulful as anything on the Band of Horses record. Blood Meridian does most swimmingly when it truncates its songs. ""Work Hard, For What?"" lets a stutter-growling organ riff do its thing for a piece before arriving suddenly at a decisive conclusion: ""Take that job and shove it up your ass."" At 2:48, the only track that's shorter is opener ""Your Boyfriends' Blues"", which delivers verses in groups of three sentences yet somehow finds room for a beautiful bridge of banjo and twinkling tremolo guitar. But that doesn't mean you should bypass the longer tracks: ""Let It Come Down"" lays down six minutes of comfy, sun-bleached guitar spirals; I'd take a day lounging on such blissful shores.

    When we last heard from Say Hi to Your Mom's Eric Elbogen on <em>Ferocious Mopes</em>, the youngster was warbling about vampires atop a perch of sturdy if unremarkable indie rock. By way of contrast, his fourth LP finds him warbling about vampires atop a perch of sturdy if unremarkable indie rock, while working in a couple of odious ""Star Trek"" references that make no sense whatsoever within the broader context of metaphorically overdrawn vampires. If it seems that undue weight is being placed upon two brief instances of questionable judgment, it's because these gaffes are so emblematic of the thematic confusion, overreaching cleverness, and phony artlessness that make <em>Impeccable Blahs</em> such a frustrating record.</p><p>
    Weak lyrics don't necessarily tank an album if the music's good enough to distract, and Elbogen's music <em>is</em> pretty good-- he's quite handy with affable melodies. His voice is unexceptional, but has a winsome charm, and his blend of rigid indie rock and twittering synth-pop is always at least passable, when not borderline inspired. The sinuous buzz and sparse handclaps of ""Blah Blah Blah"", the sleek new-wave rush of ""Angels and Darlas"", and the Postal Service rip ""Sweet Sweet Heartkiller"" are lively and memorable. But with clean simplicity as his m.o., there's not much to hide behind, and the way his long, sometimes unwieldy lines unevenly straddle rigid 4/4 pulses makes them seem even more crisply delineated in the foreground.</p><p>
    Basically, imagine if Ben Gibbard fancied himself Bob Pollard. We get incomprehensible images (""Walls that jut from the earth like frozen trajectories of superheroes""), extravagant similes (""We're as big as the Russia the mapmakers made, and mighty as a big anvil hammer""), dead-end word games (""Goes gray prematurely and never intends to <em>die</em> it out""), clunky surrealist humor that doesn't hit home (""We liked your headshots but your head could've been better""), and hokey naiveté (""It'll be over faster than you can say ‘snowcones and puppies and watching you sleep'""). And did you ever realize how subtly all things vampiric-- the bloodsucking, the invisibility, the not-quite-aliveness, and so on-- can be symbolically transposed onto plain old human romance? Don't worry; you will. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's possible to afford bald-faced pretension a measure of grudging respect for its sheer audacity, but Elbogen squanders even that consolation by trying to disguise his with a phony humility. He mistakes the assembly of consistent yet random tropes with a singular vision. Not everyone needs to be a visionary; some people can just write good songs that don't smack of private fixations (the latter are admittedly compelling, but as this album attests, you can't fake it). Elbogen would do better if he would leave the rarified sensibility to people who've come by it naturally and focus instead on his talent for lucid craft and engaging melody.

What do you expect out of a remix? Do you want to hear a composer take the song and create an even better one from its parts? Create some sort of parallel universe version that's vaguely reminiscent of the original? Or attack it Lego-style and build something entirely new with no regard to the instruction manual? Such remixes work perfectly as B-sides and EP filler material, where they often exist shoulder-to-shoulder with their original counterparts. Entire albums of rock remixes, however, like <i>Alter</i> by Switzerland's Knut, tend to slog on and on with little coherence or direction.</p>
<p>Knut's music-- a hyper-aggressive blend of technical hardcore and thrash metal-- isn't exactly prime remix material. They're not the first metal band to attempt it-- for one, labelmates Isis released <i>Oceanic Remixes/Reinterpretations</i> last year-- but I can't help but wonder why metal bands feel that this much de/reconstruction is necessary. In Knut's case, it's to commemorate the first 10 years of their career. The mixes range from stark, fragmented noise tracks to completely restructured, almost-dance numbers. While there are a few interesting offerings, it's almost impossible to listen to the album from start to finish. Honestly, I feel bad for the artists who appear towards the end of this 1:17 trek.</p>
<p>Godflesh/Jesu main man Justin Broadick's remix of ""H/armless"" is by far the most interesting here. He creates a completely mechanical, robotic rhythm with a perpetual guitar chug, leaving plenty of room for Knut vocalist Didier to bellow and wail. Similarly, Dälek's work on ""Deadverse Remix"" builds atmosphere in the swells of effects and thundering instruments. Other notable entries include ""Repressed Babylon"" by Ad's, a skittish, chopped up reconstruction that bounces from speaker to speaker, and Lad and Andres' ""Engine Pillsmix"", which evolves from broken guitar squawks to a glitchy, fragmented dance tune. But overall, these mixes reduce the original versions to either repetitive riffing with beats on top, or complete washes of noise. The former, such as Spectre's ""Psychopathic Engine"" make Knut sound far more like boring nu metal than they actually are, while the latter, such as ""Untitled #154"" by Francisco López, suck out all the life, leaving nothing engaging behind. Overall, <i>Alter</i> feels like a stroke-job, and while I'm sure it's cool for the band to hear these skewed versions of their songs, it's hard to imagine many fans getting pumped up about them.</p></div>"|9256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9256-alter/|4.9|Cory D.

    Two months ago, nearly 100 acts played the sixth annual Primavera Sound festival, in Barcelona. Among them were Animal Collective, Deerhoof, Lou Reed, Sleater-Kinney, Television Personalities, Yo La Tengo, and a 29-member pop collective that claim to call the Catalan city home. Of course, Barcelona has had its share of visitors-- from the Romans, Moors, Franks and 1992 Olympians to new Raven-Symone jawn <em>The Cheetah Girls 2: When in Spain</em>-- but this time, it really is just a clever name: I'm From Barcelona hail from Jönköping, Sweden. Principal songwriter Emanuel Lundgren is a redhead. ""This one is for you, and for you only,"" he told the crowd at the fest, who were soon chanting like Barça faithful at the Camp Nou.</p><p>
    Lundgren's cajoling conveys an intimacy that has always been essential to indie pop. In the mid-1990s, casually recorded tapes and seven-inch singles made listening to Tullycraft or the Softies feel like a private conversation, while the music's girly prettiness deterred the ""Stairway to Heaven""-weaned. On early 2006 EP <em>Don't Give Up on Your Dreams, Buddy!</em> and now with debut full-length <em>Let Me Introduce My Friends</em>, I'm From Barcelona prefer to imagine grand indie pop symphonies, replacing the tape hiss and squeaky guitars of previous decades with multi-part harmonies, strings, horns, banjo, accordion, and kazoos-- while still scaring off anybody who gets carsick from precious songs about chicken pox and tree houses. Rather than superficial gestures of authenticity, I'm From Barcelona's
    cola-commercial chorale extends an invitation: One of these voices
    could be yours.</p><p>
    The voice at the center of these vivid arrangements is Lundgren's, a matter-of-fact salutation just on the square side from Beck's hipster deadpan. With the slightest trace of a Swedish accent, it's an everydude delivery well suited for light-hearted songs about everydude stuff like tape recorders, sleeping too late, and uh stamp-collecting; the lyrics are simple, but nearly always manage to find something transcendent in the mundane. Midtempo ""Chicken Pox"" applies the lesson of childhood illness to love: ""Can't have it once you've had it,"" while ""Rec &amp; Play"" makes its eponymous buttons the center of a multi-voice metaphor about capturing the moment. ""This will be my favorite song,"" Lundgren beams. Fellow Swede and recent Sub Pop signee Loney, Dear lends his falsetto to ""This Boy"", battling Boy Least Likely To-like against maturity: ""There's always gonna be this little boy inside of me/ And there's always gonna be this little girl inside of me.""
    </p>
<p>
    The group's size makes the white-robed hordes of Polyphonic Spree an obvious comparison, but I'm From Barcelona's taut songwriting renders their numbers largely incidental-- these songs were meant to be shared by many voices. The multifarious instrumentation comes off as necessary, not schizophrenic, something like what you might expect from Beulah if they were Swedes. And at less than 38 minutes, <em>Let Me Introduce Your Friends</em> is too short for the lavishness to wear thin. In fact, I'm From Barcelona are at their best in their long farewells, from the end of modestly utopian ""Treehouse""-- which impossibly bends and branches off in new directions as the choir basically just repeats, ""I will build a treehouse""-- to the apparently Swedish-language hidden track. ""We never wanna say goodbye,"" I'm From Barcelona cheer on the penultimate song, ""Barcelona Loves You"".
    </p>
<p>
    Anyway, why Barcelona? Why <em>not</em> Barcelona, the la-la chorus, familiar vocal abundance, and slight ska feel all seem to ask on ""We're From Barcelona"", far and away the album's best song. I'm From Barcelona explain, in their slightly skewed way: ""I'm gonna sing this song with all of my friends/ And we're I'm from Barcelona/ Love is a feeling that we don't understand/ But we're gonna give it to ya."" Like ""Treehouse"", it's about a ""perfect place,"" but the choice of place itself may as well be arbitrary-- just, Barcelona, man, all right? Pop music, particularly the indie variety, has always been about belonging, yet there is always so much conflict over who belongs where. I'm From Barcelona are the band that wrote the song that could make Israel and Hezbollah get along-- don't these folks realize we're all from Barcelona? We bring them love! Next up, global warming.

    Everything and nothing has changed for Comets on Fire on <em>Avatar</em>, the Sub Pop group's latest LP. While the band had previously found a way to boil its pedigree of proto-metal influences into pure adrenaline, suddenly it seems to be using the entire pot, slow songs and all. Fans of the group's previous album, <em>Blue Cathedral</em>, will wonder what's happened to its full-bore rock: Mid-tempo opener and tone-setter ""Dogwood Rust"" sounds rollicking when compared to some of the piano-led tracks that follow it. On ""Dogwood"", Ethan Miller's vocals have relaxed, though the musicians haven't, still jamming and stretching to the ends of their abilities, just a little quieter this time. The relative calm of the track can't hide its vintage metal melody, and the band shortly drops back to let the bass march it into more improvisational territory.
    <em></em></p><p>
    The relentless patter of the drums rolls on through the even gentler ""Jaybird"", and listeners may begin to welcome Miller's sweeter, softer tones-- as long as a guitar still squirms with spite in the distance, of course. Many of these tracks promise a heavier freak-out after their initial pussyfootin', but the change always comes smoothly and naturally. Divert your attention for a minute, and you might assume ""Jaybird"" is over, but it's just the heavy blues riff finally clearing its throat and making itself heard.</p><p>
    For a band that trades in sounding over-the-top, wistful suits Comets on Fire pretty well.  It's strange to hear them croon over a teetering piano, but it's worth noting how comfortable they sound in that role, and how easily they slide back and forth through it. Of course, someone busts out with an abstract squiggle or a squealing lead whenever the cliché meter veers toward the red (see ""Lucifer's Memory"", the closest the band come to a power ballad). And Comets on Fire have been mining the sound for so long, those self-sabotaging moments sound completely natural-- it's the perfect time in their career to throw a curveball. 
    </p>
<p>
    It helps that the record is excellently paced: starting with the heavy hook of ""Dogwood Rust"", getting quieter and quieter until the nearly-instrumental ""Swallow's Eye"", then returning with the forceful backdraft of ""Holy Teeth"", a tantalizing three-minute burst of the band at top speed. The weak spot is ""Sour Smoke"", a meandering two-organ stomp that creeps like a giant trying to sneak down a hallway. All other tracks never lose a sense of purpose despite their detours, and are surprisingly tuneful. 
    </p>
<p>
    Their loose, improvisational style still falls under some people's definition of ""jamming,"" but just as it seemed to me with <em>Blue Cathedral</em>, it's textural above all else. The chops are easily discernible under the surface, but they don't put a hand up in the air or a spotlight on anyone (including Ben Chasny, now a full-time Comet) when it's time for the hot licks, they just charge forward. Moreover, you don't need to count every note to understand what they're aiming for. It could be on headphones, car speakers, or in the distance during a barbecue and I would understand what Comets on Fire were getting across: They have to honor their influences not by merely updating their sound, but by beating them at their own game. Skirting indulgence just isn't an option. Put on the record when your all-night party prepares to cower and squint in the first rays of daylight, or maybe just play it as side 2 to <em>Blue Cathedral</em>'s side 1, the comedown section to a massive slab of unrepentant hard-rock musicianship. Just like last time around, <em>Avatar</em> is something for the plebes, the purists, the dabblers, and the old heads all at once-- a crossover in the best sense of the word.

    St. Louis' So Many Dynamos have their feet firmly planted on the same shaky, unstable ground as Les Savy Fav and Q and Not U. The tracks on their sophomore release, <em>Flashlights</em>, feature upbeat tempos and driving melodies bursting through chaotic arrangements. Their debut garnered plenty of Dismemberment Plan comparisons, and while vocalist Aaron Stovall still sounds a bit like Travis Morrison, they've built on that foundation to create their own sound-- complete with horns, banjo, piano, and a 30-piece choir. So just like the band has done, let's leave the comparisons behind and let the album hit us head on, with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>
    What initially strikes me as impressive about <em>Flashlights</em> is how in control of the chaos the band seems. Most of these songs are brimming with excitement, at times pushing things into post-punk territory. In addition, there are curveballs galore, where the band turns a song on its ear, breaking into something completely different for seconds at a time. Take ""Search Party"", for example. It begins as a jangly indie rock song with a dance beat and catchy guitar leads. Stovall's shouted vocals carry the verses to a sing-along chorus before the song transforms into a series of blasts of percussion, squawking horns, and group shouts.</p><p>
    The album's Chris Deckard production-- featuring up-front group harmonies and airy drums-- gives the impression of a live performance, but the guitars are crisp and clear. On tracks like the reserved ""How High the Moon"" this lends a darkness to the mood, while on ""Inventing Gears"" it helps reign in the chaos, with the buzz of the bass guitar cutting through the noodling guitars and spastic drumming. Stovall's vocals, unfortunately, sometimes rely too heavily on tuneful speaking rather than actual singing or shouting. His phrasing is usually great, but there are moments when the vocals are distracting and end up working against the momentum of the song. Thankfully, the disc's final two tracks, ""In Our Sleep"" and ""Let's Move Mountains"", shut things down on a high note. Both feature lengthy instrumental interludes where the auxiliary instruments are woven seamlessly into the band's established sound. And while some people may find it hard to get past the band's no-qualms policy of wearing their influences on their collective sleeve, that would be a shame given the strength of <em>Flashlights</em>' more adventurous moments.

    Over the course of his three previous full-length albums as Eluvium, Portland-based composer Matthew Cooper has carved himself a handsome niche by working a wide range of minimalist textures, ranging from solo piano pieces to densely layered immersive drones. His latest four-track EP <em>When I Live By the Garden and the Sea</em> perhaps makes most sense when considered as brief addendum to his gorgeous 2005 album <em>Talk Amongst the Trees, </em>but also serves as a tidy recapitulation of all his career's main themes and techniques to date. Working again in a wholly beatless environment, Cooper presents another thoughtful assortment of ambient waveforms, all crafted with a patience that can cause them to resemble time-lapse footage of a twining vine slowly climbing towards the sunlight.</p><p>
    Though they vary in their construction materials, each of the album's four tracks seem built to gradually reveal themselves as one seamless whole. In fact, the song titles here can almost be read in order as one continuous, unwieldy sentence. ""I Will Not Forget That I Have Forgotten"" opens the session with a vibrant, piano-centered surge that hearkens back to Eluvium's 2003 album <em>An Accidental Memory in the Case of Death</em>. Here Cooper rides a lovely circular piano pattern through intermittent whitecaps of translucent guitar effects until the piano is eventually capsized, its distant keys growing ever fainter as they echo away into the depths, never to be heard from again on this record.</p><p>
    On the following ""As I Drift Off"", Cooper makes the cryptic choice to open with an incongruous snatch of movie dialogue courtesy of Tom Hanks in <em>The 'Burbs</em>. This is an effective strategy if his intent is simply to jar his sleepier listeners out of their collective stupor, but it's left unclear if this sample has any further narrative purpose to the track's grainy flightpath. The remainder of the piece seems built entirely from gentle, disembodied guitar wash, with Cooper recalling Kevin Shields as he allows the lightest trace of dissonance to edge the music's surface. This leads effortlessly into the beautifully shifting drones of ""All the Sails"", a piece that sits cozily alongside the dreamy cascades of such peers as Stars of the Lid or Windy and Carl. 
    </p>
<p>
    The set-closing ""When I Live By the Garden and the Sea"" uses a similar technique as well, but adds a subtle layer of bell-like tones above Cooper's luminous electronic drift. And though he manages to sustain this piece's fragile ecosystem for over seven minutes, like all of Eluvium's best work the track seems to pass by in a solitary whisper. Overall, however, the EP's relatively short duration and sheer unadulterated prettiness can leave <em>When I Live By the Garden and the Sea</em> feeling rather weightless and impermanent, as though one strong gust could blow the whole delicate structure away to nothing. Yet throughout the album Cooper's meditative focus, attention to microscopic detail, and hands-on workmanship allow these pieces to continually yield new discoveries, while clearing a route for the next stage of Eluvium's ongoing ambient explorations.

But if you see them perform, there will come a point when Bo Madsen is playing metal-style power chords, while the long-haired 1970s-prog keyboard player unleashes his “epic” wash settings, and singer Jonas Bjerre soars up into his sappiest, most atmospheric register, and you’ll notice that they’re
    good with hair gel and look like soap stars, and it’ll all come clear.
    These guys are not “cool”-- these guys are like <em>Queensryche</em>. Queensryche meets Sigur Rós, but still.</p><p>
    And maybe that’s the pinnacle of style in Denmark (what do I know), but over here it’s uncool, and that uncoolness is part of what makes <em>And the Glass-Handed Kites</em>, now released in the U.S., one of the better rock records of the year. The band’s reference points are normal enough in the indie world-- Radiohead, My Bloody Valentine-- but the ambitions they draw out of them are not: These are some of the only guys around who still believe in hard-rock Valhalla, the kind of lavish, stratospheric, fairy-tale prog that’s less about making aging boys geek out and more about making young girls swoon. Who else does this-- would Stars ever rock out like this? Even a grandiose pop band like Coldplay wants to act down-to-earth, and here are these guys with their dreamy thunderstorm pop.</p><p>
    The payoff, of course, is that they really are nearly as magnificent as they’re hoping to be. For one thing, they’re not actually throwbacks, and their rock is cutting-edge elegant: Madsen’s rhythm guitar scratches through odd chord voicings like Radiohead, his lead lines match the dreamy buzz of any shoegazer act, and the keyboard and piano lead both through epic builds and breakdowns with only the slightest winks at “cheesy”; on first listen, they sound more like a better-funded Swirlies than a laser-light show. These grand songs-- the whole record is technically one continuous piece, but whatever-- are complicated in a way that’s <em>theirs</em>: Bjerre’s doe-eyed vocal melodies come in strange, lilting figures, and the band switches through tricky half-measures, endless changeups, and sly, slick rhythms to wrap around them.</p><p>
    This stuff might even be considered “difficult,” if it didn’t always come back to the starry-eyed soaring. Like “The Zookeeper’s Boy”, which acts like it might be a great knotty rock song for approximately 30 muscular seconds. Then the keyboards start sparkling, and then Bjerre teases you with the most unapologetically glorious chorus here-- a heart-clutching, soaring-through-clouds, upper-register plaint: “Are you/ My lady, are you.” All 53 minutes are packed full of ideas like that, often to the point of over-egging things: oceanic dream-pop on “Chinaberry Tree”, interstellar hard rock on “Apocalypso” (seriously: how prog is that?), or geologically huge melodies on “Saviours of Jazz Ballet” (which sounds like Yes album covers look). They have song titles like “The Seething Rain Weeps for You” and lyrics about girls with “meringue-colored hair.” </p><p>
    It’s a terrific accomplishment, and it’s tempting to imagine one reason why-- that these guys are playing not out of fashion, but out of pure belief. What’s stranger is to imagine how this fashion-bucking record could pull fans from so many different classes of listener: arty cloud-buster for Coldplay fans, sensitive hard-rock opus for Guitar Center techies and Dream Theater devotees, a masterpiece for people who haven’t smoked weed yet but are thinking about it, Bambi-faced European dreamers to match the unicorn poster on the wall. For our readers-- at a time when indie rock is enamored of scratchy post-punk minimalism, and even a grand-ambition pop act like Bloc Party pretends to be bristly-- this could be the escape of the year, a curve off into the lush, ambitious stargazing that used to happen all the time. No matter which direction listeners come from on this one, they’ll find the same thing: If you’re up for that fairy-tale rock glory, these guys have it down.</p></div>"|9285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9285-and-the-glass-handed-kites/|8.4|Nitsuh Abebe

Since this disc-- really more of a single-- is bound to be eclipsed in a month, listeners must treat it as a superficial preview of grander ambitions. In fact, the new album (<em>The Letting Go</em>) is the legitimate heir to the straggling elegies of 2003's <em>Master and Everyone</em>. But, apparently, fans can't wait to discover how the erratic Will Oldham has consolidated his ghoulish antiquity with the sort of burnished pop melodies found on <em>Greatest Palace Hits</em> and <em>Superwolf</em>. Of the EP's three songs, only the titular track reveals any hints of a great synthesis. The other two are seductive cult songs that emphasize texture over tunefulness; they sacrifice emotions and choruses for clever flamboyancy. There's nothing wrong with that emphasis, though, and Oldham's songs exude an effortless coolness and humor even as they taunt the singer's wounded heart.</p><p>
    ""Cursed Sleep"", <em>The Letting Go</em>'s first single, ornaments a conventional Western folk song with all sorts of fanciful effects: clinking percussion, squeaking keyboards, and a fitful orchestra whose flourishes and trills sound like they're hurled out of a doddering electric guitar. Drums and violins are drenched in mud and soot, and smooth classic rock emanates from the fringes. Sifting through this debris, the chorus reveals itself as one giant, garish shriek. It's an unkempt arrangement, soiled and torn, barely held together by Oldham's disconcertingly confident and centered voice.</p><p>
    The single's B-sides are vastly more irregular and inventive. ""The Signifying Wolf"" starts as a parody of 1990s lo-fi, but the fuzz escalates and the vocals dampen until the whole track takes on an impression of saliva-choked convulsion. The voices are somewhere between comatose and possessed: huffing hollers, drooled mumbles, and the sort of bar-band rhythm section that people throw glass bottles at. It's an entire song covered in orgasms, asphyxiations, and pagan chants, and the production lets vaporous feedback roll around the perimeter. ""God's Small Song"" is nearly the opposite: calm-before-the-storm apprehension that's both narcoleptic and nervous. Oldham wanders lazily through long, yawning vocals and sun-spangled guitar. But, for all that abstraction and foreboding, the smiling chorus strikes and evaporates like a vague recollection.</p><p>
    Without the context of <em>The Letting Go</em>, <em>Cursed Sleep</em> is mostly content to stand as a slender digest of Oldham exotica. Whatever the songs lack in ambition, they make up for in charisma. But, of course, they're only brief-- and rather meager-- preliminaries. Unless you make it a point to listen to music in duplicate, you may as well continue to wait for the final product.<br/></p></div>"|9268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9268-the-cursed-sleep-ep/|6.9|Alex Linhardt

    After disappearing off the map for several years, former
    market leader Force Tracks have quietly returned to stake their claim as the
    European electronic label with the most radical trajectory, abandoning
    completely the continental theory and austerity of sister labels Force Inc. and
    Mille Plateaux, and emerging as an unashamed ""proper"" house label.
    Shorn of its former star roster, the label has settled on Swedish producer Unai
    (real name: Erik Møller) to be the ambassador for their reincarnation,
    selecting him to mix the label's recent <em>Digital Disco 3</em> compilation.</p><p>
    Which makes sense, as Unai's debut album for the label (his second overall) is
    a quintessential Force Tracks record: obsessively tweaked digital disco for
    (pop) lovers. Pitched somewhere between the not-terribly-distant poles of
    Luomo's <em>The Present Lover</em> and Richard Davis' <em>Details</em>, <em>A Love
    Moderne</em> is similarly captivated by house's capacity to convey desire of
    near-cosmic proportions. As with Luomo, these tracks are at once superficially
    pretty and tightly compressed, bristling with a swelter of contained emotions.
    Unai's key weapon here is burbling, jumbled-sounding keyboard riffs that
    gradually coalesce into a functioning but internally conflicted house groove,
    as if charting a journey from confusion to bittersweet insight. Taken to its
    extreme, as on ""Lucky Bastard"", the effect is as reminiscent of the
    stuttering synth-disco grooves of Rockwilder as much as any house producer, but
    there is never any carnal quality here: the prickly stutters and burbles
    restrict themselves to evoking the palpitations of the heart.</p><p>
    With their foggy synths, fleeting hooks, and delicately propulsive beats,
    Unai's grooves can tend toward the shapeless, and he relies on his own
    songwriting and singing to hold them together. His vocals are fundamentally--
    perhaps intentionally-- weak, caught somewhere between indie whisper and
    soulful croon, but more tentative and nebulous than either. He fashions his
    lyrics to suit: on ""I Like Your Style"" he pours forth a quiet litany
    of time-wasting equivocations and humble intimations, the conclusion in the
    title being the most forthright declaration of love he can manage. Mixed front
    and center, such handwringing might become unbearable, but Unai's sighs hover
    always in the background, an uninvited guest in his own songs, proffering
    messages of desire that are repeatedly dashed against the rocks of
    impossibility. </p><p>
    It's a strategically sound and effective move-- on ""Modern Love"" he
    transforms into a ghostly choir whose refrain combines frustration,
    fascination, and resignation. Still, this perpetual backgrounding underscores
    what is perhaps the album's main weakness: a lightness of touch that conceals a
    reluctance to forge direct emotional connections. Modern love, we can only
    assume, is a fragile affair, glimpsed in stolen glances and whispers, furtive
    text messages and on-line exchanges. Which is all well and good as a theme, but
    many of these songs would benefit from some of the declamatory openness and
    physicality they carefully exclude. On the album's stronger songs, such as the
    breathy, sighing first single ""Oh You And I"", this handicap is
    actually endearing. But these songs rest precariously on the memorability of
    their hooks and refrains; in contrast, ""Heart Is To The Left""
    meanders aimlessly, searching for something that can break it out of its
    straightjacket of restraint.</p><p>
<em>A Love Moderne</em> only abandons tentativeness in the face of love's death
    throes: ""Steps to Heaven are Steps to Me"" staggers forward doggedly,
    its groove heartbroken and perhaps mortally wounded, all lurching beats and
    gasping asthmatic synths, the soundtrack to the execution of a death pact by
    star-crossed lovers. Its sequel, the haunting closer ""Exit Wounds"",
    gathers clouds of shimmering chords and staticky hiss around itself in a dazed
    reverie brought on by fatal blood loss. Such breakthroughs are painful, moments
    where the elaborate façades of Unai's sweeter songs are sharply punctured. That
    these exceptions are staged with such exquisite precision suggests that Unai
    has more of a flair for full-blooded melodrama than he perhaps realizes: he
    should allow himself to indulge it more often.

    NYC electroclasher My Robot Friend (aka Howard Rigberg) is most celebrated for his live shows that find him performing in a self-designed robot suit complete with a flame-shooting phallus. So it should probably go without saying that a full appreciation for My Robot Friend's recorded work requires a heathy tolerance for daffy-ass gimmicks and novelty. But if one is able to ignore (or even celebrate) some of his more frivolous high-concept shenanigans, Rigberg's second full-length album <em>Dial 0 </em>boasts a generous handful of surprisingly thoughtful, well-constructed songs that linger long after the spectacle fades.</p><p>
    As with his 2004 debut album <em>Hot Action</em>, here Rigberg attempts to get as much mileage as possible from his wry, detached robo-commentary on human relations. Fortunately, however, <em>Dial 0</em> also features a number of productive cameos from such guests as Antony Hegarty, Autojulie 3000, and Jay Kauffman that greatly help expand the music's breadth and increase the shelf-life of My Robot Friend's ongoing shtick. <em>Dial 0</em> opens inauspiciously with a kitschy sample from an old self-hypnosis record that sounds like it might've been lifted wholesale from a Man or Astroman? album, but quickly comes to full speed with My Robot Friend's unlikely cover of Luna's ""23 Minutes in Brussels"". Here Dean Wareham's languid post-VU guitar excursion is transformed into a vibrant, jittery landscape of chiming bell-like tones, spiraling electronics and urban fatigue as Rigberg takes a dramatic detour from his standard Howard Robot persona.</p><p>
    Even more revelatory is the brilliant ""One More Try"", on which guest vocalist Antony takes a virtually flawless turn as full-on disco diva, showcasing yet another side of his formidable range over My Robot Friend's percolating, pitch-bent synth-pop. Other highlights include the propulsive, Devo-informed electro-rock of the title track, which has been previously released as a single, and the captivating chiaroscuro ""Dead"", which is further augmented by the looming, Apparat-style strings of Autojulie 3000. 
    </p>
<p>
    Robot or no, however, Rigberg evidently can't seem to resist engaging in a little cheeky pop psychology. ""Everything you do is a reaction to the way your mother combed her hair,"" he intones mechanically on ""Problems"" before helpfully concluding ""You and your problems/ No one can tell you apart."" Considerably less charming is the salacious dry-hump ""Swallow"", featuring a guest performance by Crasta Yo, on which Howard launches into an omni-sexual patter in his best deadpan robotic monotone, sufficiently wringing the life out of the tedious one-joke riff. 
    </p>
<p>
    Equally disappointing is My Robot Friend's tepid version of Blondie's ""Rapture"", which substitutes Deborah Harry's vocal with cut and pasted spoken-word samples to give it a ransom-note discontinuity that grows slightly more insufferable with each successive listen. Packaged alongside throwaways like the Kraftwerk-lite ""City Sounds"" or the goofy, folk guitar-accented non-sequiters of ""Electric Pants"" (""The pants that I am wearing are mathematical"") even My Robot Friend's undeniable triumphs can lose some of their inventive luster. Several of the best tracks on <em>Dial 0</em> have been or will be released as singles, accompanied with remixes by the likes of Modeselektor, Safety Scissors, Freelance Hellraiser, and Derrick Carter, and one can't help but think that perhaps some of these tracks might be best enjoyed with that extra degree of remove from Rigberg's overactive theatrics.

    exploding speakers, filleting his vocal chords, and working-up a sweat in the brilliantly venomous
    Motörheaded power trio High on Fire. Now, as if seeking a
    post-<em>Jerusalem</em>/<em>Dopesmoker</em> golden mean, he's fronting Bay Area doom rockers, Kalas.</p><p>
    It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that Pike's a great
    guitarist. What is unexpected: This new outfit finds the axe-grinder
    sans main weapon, focusing his energy on those familiar High on Fire snarls
    and hollers. The reason? Who knows, but that this master riff-churner attends
    band practice sans six-string is bad casting: Doing a
    blow-by-blow comparison between High on Fire and this quintet, Pike's
    single guitar rains heavier intonations than the two dudes backing him
    on Kalas' self-titled debut.</p><p>
    The role switcheroo reminds me of
    another Tee Pee band, Witch. In case you forgot, that doom band finds
    folkie Feathers guys fronting J Mascis on drums. In Witch, Kyle Thomas
    and Asa Irons totally rise to the occasion, making Dinosaur J's
    presence merely a bonus addition to their nasal dead meadow lark. Kalas are pleasant enough, but in the context of Pike's other accomplishments, they aren't nearly as compelling. If Pike wasn't up front, there wouldn't
    be much reason to listen.
    </p><p>
    Of course, it's not just Pike: Kalas
    includes guitarists Andy Branton of Econochrist/Samiam and Paul Kott of
    Cruevo; Cruevo drummer Scott Plumb, and bassist Brad Reynolds. It's
    a California supergroup. But then, High on Fire aren't just Pike either.
    On <em>Blessed Black Wings</em> the trio was Earth/Melvins/Sunn 0)))
    collaborator Joe fucking Preston, aka Thrones, on bass and the mighty Des
    Kensel on drums. (Outside of Mastodon's Brann Dailor is there anyone
    doing such interestingly heavy stuff in a bigger-time above-ground metal crew?)
    </p>
<p>
    One
    of the best songs here, ""Frozen Sun"", is the only tune where Pike snatches
    his guitar and plays lead. It's a treat: He has a way of turning it
    into an extension of his voice, which explodes or lulls accordingly.
    Strumming out some chilled, bluesy progressions, he wails (in total
    anguish) about the fucked-up state of the human condition. In general, these songs about
    addiction, death, technological amnesia, and unjust legislations are
    more socially engaged than Sleep's ""drop out of life with bong in
    hand"" stuff and less steeped in the dark devilution fantasia of High on
    Fire. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are a some other good bits, though they don't sound
    as tuneful. ""Monuments to Ruins"" sports a nice bass line, two-pronged
    guitar groove, and an oddly emo theme: ""Cry for the children who die/
    For the ones who hang below the bridge/ Are punished for their
    crimes."" ""Godpills"" also delivers the goods with a nice slow-build to
    dark-clouded thunderstorm. On it, some of Pike's scowls remind me of John Brannon in
    his Laughing Hyenas days, which is always a plus. The problem is that these
    highlights occur at the beginning of the record and by the time you
    move past song five, ""Things Done and Undone"", the feel is set and
    expected and there are very few surprises. Bring on the grubby
    caffeinated sludge! 
    </p>
<p>
    This is a pretty relaxing listen.
    Maybe that's its purpose: Smoke a bowl and doze to Sleep and then shake
    yourself out of it a tad with Kalas until you're in the proper
    mind-state to handle High on Fire. Well, yeah, if your entire record
    collection consists of Matt Pike-related bands. Otherise, I'd suggest you just check out St. Vitus.

    in the band's fragmentary, boom-hiss salad days, the 23 tracks strike
    a ragamuffin balance between the two songwriters and collaborators at their idiosyncratic prime. That history's been mapped thoroughly, but in 1991, part of the appeal sprouted from a certain mystery. The unknowability's gone; still, reissued with an 18-track bonus CD and new liner notes written by the band, the original indie masterpiece hasn't aged a bit.</p><p>
    Hitting the record bins after <em>The Freed Man</em> and <em>Weed Forestin'</em>, <em>III</em> added bassist/drummer/third vocalist/middle man Jason Loewenstein, solidifying the band's prime formation. Song-wise, Barlow was still smarting about his unceremonious firing from Dinosaur Jr.-- along with his anxious relationship with on-off girlfriend and future wife, Kathleen
    Billus. Accordingly, his best songs call out Mascis (""The Freed Pig""'s
    insistently angular guitar jab) and/or pine for/praise his lady (the
    gorgeous ""Kath""). Gaffney, on the other hand, displays a darker vibe,
    documenting his fucked-up family life (""As The World Dies, The Eyes of
    God Grow Bigger"", with his dad fried on liquid LSD, young Eric's head hitting concrete, grandma getting stoned), ""Violet Execution"", and ""Scars, Four Eyes"" (co-written with Barlow). Even the covers-- the Minutemen's ""Sickles and Hammers"" and a warped rendition of Johnny Mathis' ""Wonderful, Wonderful""-- comfortably snuggle into the grainy, duct-tapped landscape. There are some Loewenstein-penned stinkers (see ""Smoke a Bowl"") and average bits (the country jangle of ""Black-Haired Girl""), but the lows are so fucked up and indulgent, they become an integral part of its imperfect charm. If you remove one, the structure topples.
    </p><p>
    I remember seeing Sebadoh live at Maxwell's in Hoboken right around the release of <em>III</em>. Barlow had a big-ass pimple on his cheek, his guitar was held in parts by tape, and he was peddling Sebadoh shirts he'd made with magic markers. Between songs, he bent down and pressed play on a boom-box, launching pre-recorded salvos (including a ""three is the magic number"" sample): ""Turning personal vendetta and small-minded revenge tactics into eventual cult status. The only man in the world who truly appreciated the genius of the Swans, Lou Barlow,"" ""Sebadoh, featuring that guy who played bass in Soul Asylum,"" ""another evening of oppressive noodling,"" ""metaphorically pissing in your mouth,"" and ""Your postmodern folk-core saviors, Sebadoh."" These one-liners and non-sequiturs are available on the reissues bonus CD, as a track called ""Showtape '91"". I approached Barlow at that same show and asked him some dumb teenager question about Mascis and he sorta told me to fuck off.
    </p>
<p>
    Today, I miss that snotty, anti-PR indie-- it was both the piss and romanticism that made Sebadoh vital. Once Barlow got over Mascis (see Dinosaur Jr. reunion tour) and tied the knot the band felt hollow. Fifteen years ago, his bile was best, most humorously encapsulated on ""Gimme Indie Rock"". Beyond its right-on satire, if you changed the dates around a bit, it offered a musical biography of just about everyone I knew at the time: ""Started back in '83/ Started seeing things differently / Hardcore wasn't doing it for me no more/ Started smoking pot, thought things sounded better slow..."" Then comes the gallery of in-scene disses: ""Cracking jokes like a Thurston Moore/ Pedal hopping like a Dinosaur J.../ Taking inspiration from Hüsker Dü/ It's a new generation of electric white boy blues."" That fight song, along with the four other songs that joined it on a 1991 7"", appear on the bonus CD with a four-track demo of ""The Freed Pig"", a super flanged almost throat-sung ""Stars For Eyes"", and a 2004 ""Violet Execution"" remix.
    </p>
<p>
    Reviewing an album that functioned as such a personal watershed obviously presents the opportunity for nostalgia-induced hyperbole, but even after taking a step back from <em>III</em> it still deserves every last bit of praise. Sebadoh followed this effort with other fine moments; nowhere else did they so perfectly meld rickety folk, tin-can guitar, Shrimper-style ambiance, feedbacking ""power sludge,"" eccentric compositional constructions, carcinogenic hooks, and poetic sincerity. Over the years since its release, the ""I'm just me! Listen to me! A whole all-American original!"" mantra that surfaces amid the trembly acoustic boom of ""Downnmind"" has become more than just tongue-in-cheek tomfoolery: Even if Lou, Eric, and Jason didn't know it at the time, those stoner fucks created something essential. I haven't heard anything like it since.

    If Sigur Rós were gonna try to shock listeners with an off-the-cuff Iron Maiden homage-- and it's not as if they haven't got
    the singer to pull it off-- this indie EP would be the place to do it. Well... there's always the next one, I guess. A collector-baiting addendum to last
    year's exquisite <em>Takk</em>, this CD/DVD bundle includes the title track, three previously
    unreleased outtakes, and videos for ""Glósóli"",
    ""Hoppípolla"", and ""Sæglópur"". As for the new tracks, instead
    of briefly leaving their comfort zone as they did on the Inuit-scat rain-dance
    finale of the <em>Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do</em> EP, Sigur Rós merely offer a few characteristic, subdued denouements. And while it's refreshing to see their latest vids in
    high-gloss-- as opposed to today's <em>de rigueur</em> YouTube
    pixilation-- they all reiterate past visual tropes (kids, slow-motion) yet lack the emotional impact of career bests ""Viðrar Vel Til
    Loftárása"" (gay soccer teens)  and
    ""Untitled #1"" (apocalypse recess). For a band that's commonly
    criticized as pretentiously one-note, Sigur Rós seem more than happy to feed
    into that notion here.</p><p>
    Plus, let's face it, the grand scope
    of Sigur Rós' music is best heard over the course of an album; it all but demands ample gestation time for the bows to begin bearing
    down and singer Jónsi Birgisson to start calling
    the seals. Unfortunately, the group
    doesn't attempt to adapt to the shorter medium here. Rather, they use the muted limelight to simply showcase their milder
    side; apart from the title track's wailing bombast, nary a distorted guitar is
    heard on the rest of the audio disc.</p><p>
    The tone of <em>Sæglópur</em>'s soft-focused extras stands in contrast to the title song. Possibly <em>Takk</em>'s
    finest moment, the eight-minute ""Sæglópur"" skews Sigur Rós' typical
    long-buildup/short-peak trajectory, breaking well before the
    halfway point, and then barreling like a warship in a <em>Deadliest Catch</em>-style tempest. The
    brooding-piano instrumental ""Refur"" could be rewarding as an
    interlude but here it's largely pointless. ""O Fridur"" provides the release's only fresh vocals over a repetitive elegy of
    shimmering strings and flutes. Closer ""Kafari"", meanwhile, barely raises above a whisper,
    although its smoothed-out take on the band's rise-and-fall formula-- pushed along by
    raining glockenspiel plinks-- makes it the <em>de facto</em> highlight amidst the
    lulling unreleased material.  
    </p>
<p>
    The package's
    accompanying DVD finds the band playing it safe as well. As one of the only
    contemporary rock groups to deserve the ""cinematic"" tag, Sigur Rós can be brilliant at capturing their unique sonics on
    film. Famous for emphasizing the collision between childlike innocence and the
    oppressive world of adulthood, their Neverland visual fables often add gravity to
    the accompanying supersonic howls and airy atmospherics. But, while <em>Takk</em> found the band
    emphasizing their aural strengths in revelatory fashion, its videos halt that
    momentum, instead relying on rehashed kid's stuff. 
    </p>
<p>
    Set against surreal skies
    and a craggy landscape, ""Glósóli"" is a marvel to look at and its widescreen
    cinematography outdoes most studio features. Yet its little-tyke Pied Piper
    march lacks the visceral conflict that defines their best sound/vision pieces.
    ""Hoppípolla"" is worse; the cheap thrill of having senior citizens act like kids is too easy a twist to their favorite motif. ""Sæglópur""'s video
    is the darkest but it could also be band's least compelling yet: Its live-action underwater adventure features a (spoiler alert!) young man being chased by an
    octopus-like creature... and that's basically it.
    </p>
<p>
    It's funny to think about all the Radiohead comparisons that
    greeted Sigur Rós when they initially took off six years ago; whereas Thom Yorke and co. thrive on experimentation and change, Iceland's premier pool-recorders seem immune to it.
    Since they have such a singular sound-- one which remarkably has yet to be successfully emulated-- slight improvements here and there are often good enough. But <em>Sæglópur</em>'s
    quiet dabbles, while quaint, are unnecessary when held against
    the triumphant <em>Takk</em>. And, dudes, next video? How about some grown-ups doing
    grown-up things. Crazy, I know.

    Playing the theremin for the first time can be a revelatory experience for
    guitar players-- accustomed to pulling music out of an instrument, you're
    suddenly confronted with one where you push it back in. Personal pride gives
    way to humility at the sovereignty of sound. The improvisational electro troupe
    Excepter makes sound art in the latter mold. After all, if you want to get
    abstract, writing a song is a pointless exercise, like carving an apple into
    the shape of a smaller apple. Raw sound naturally resolves into patterns that
    Excepter, using strands of synthesizer, percussion, and sampled electronics,
    repeatedly try and fail to disrupt. Rubble still describes a system, and in the
    absence of intent, a system creates its own meaning.</p><p>
    So Excepter's stance is classically formalist-- the message subsides beneath
    the medium, then reemerges profoundly changed. We're used to their recordings
    working one idea through copious face-melting permutations. On <em>KA</em>, they
    explored coruscating Krautrock, while <em>Throne</em> was all doomy incantation. <em>Self-Destruction
    </em>and <em>Sunbomber</em> were static and sparse, like grotesquely deformed
    parodies of house music. But on <em>Alternation</em>, Excepter is flirting with
    coherent variation and bona fide songs.</p><p>
    While cutting a swath through a variety of electronic genres, Excepter still
    fucks with dance music-- ""Lypscnm E6! X"" festoons a disorderly tinkle
    of percussion with Soulwax-precise blips as warbling synths bend in paper-clip
    formations and Suicide's slow throb pushes along toneless vocals. But
    atypically, the strands almost fit together, describing a clean rhythmic thrust
    rather than a densely involuted spiral. ""The 'Rock' Stepper"" is
    broke-down acid house, but there's only low-level tension. There's no release,
    no blissed-out shortcuts to derangement, just patient mutation, a long slow
    slide toward an edge that recedes as it's approached. ""He walks like his
    legs are broken,"" goes one of two lyrics on the album that might not be
    red herrings (more on the other soon)-- Excepter locomotes, but only with
    profound difficulty.
    </p>
<p>
    On the brutally spare ""The Ladder"", distant dino percussion, an
    off-time bleat, mumbled vocals, and a gyroscopic pulse allude to the most
    rudimentary, gestural deep house imaginable. ""Ice Cream Van"" builds a
    sort of monstrous synth-pop from twiddly snake-charming electro and rigid
    percussion, with vocals about the existential plight of an ice cream man in the
    winter that incomprehensibly segue into ""Do Your Ears Hang Low?"".
    ""Back Me Up"" alludes to early, electro-influenced hip-hop, while
    ""Op Pop"" has roughly the same relationship to dub that a cave
    painting does to a bison. And ""(The Pipes)"" is ""house""
    music in the most literal sense-- the clank of actual plumbing mingles with a
    high synthetic whine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    The
    glistering nighttime glide ""If I Were You"" contains the second
    instructive lyric-- ""I'd like to introduce our machines to you, but I
    forgot their names/ I'd like to shake hands with each and every one of you, but
    I'm onstage."" Unlike many electro-noise acts, Excepter aren't gear fetishists.
    Their machines are a means to an end, creating noises that matter less for
    their specific qualities than their infinitude. And the creators themselves
    never really occur in these gusty, revenant-smeared corridors. While <em>Alternation</em>
    is their closest brush with deliberate order, it retains the reverent slippage
    and self-effacement of their previous work. They still seem unconcerned with
    the ratification of their existence through art-- it's more than enough to be
    obliquely perceived, and to leave a residue of the phenomenon behind.

Janine Rostron, aka Planningtorock, is among the latter. Rostron left England for Berlin and ran into Peaches, Kevin Blechdom, Jamie Lidell, and Chicks On Speed along the way. While Planning... doesn't sound much like her fellow expats, she does share their flair for the theatrical-- she performs live in Elizabethan costumes and masks-- which is fitting considering her video work predated her music.</p><p>
    Part travelogue, part self-help manual, Rostron's debut album details the transformational powers of getting the fuck out of town (in her case Bolton, England), and using the self-imposed alienation to examine personal truths and discover survival skills. ""Bolton Wander"" is a straightforward narrative of her move and the reasoning behind it. ""Local Foreigner"" moves on its belly, with eerie percussive vocal stabs and tambourines slithering in and out and Berlin's empty buildings echoing in the song's hollow corners.</p><p>
    If half of <em>Have It All</em> is about leaving home, the other is about never going back. The sprightly ""Changes"" explains her metamorphosis. Here her lower vocals are backed by a higher, ghostlier version of the same, as if her different stages are duking it out for supremacy. Eventually the more confident Berliner wins out. On album centerpiece ""I Wanna Bite Ya"" Rostron flips ""I hate your guts"" on its head : ""What happens if/ I start on your little finger/ What happens if/ I'm halfway up your elbow."" This is Rostron's central strength: Her ability to collapse the distinction between threat and enticement, and make you forget that there ever was a distinction in the first place. It's violence rendered playful with a flirty xylophone trill, and sex stripped of any innocence by a guttural growl.
    </p><p>
    Despite her location and label, Rostron doesn't make dance music. Planningtorock also separates herself from her label mates by keeping her vocals pure, expressive, and soulful; she eschews electro's lifeless monotones and IDM's synth manipulations. The title track has the album's only true beat and bass lines. Most of tracks on <em>Have It All</em> stay away from bass-heavy dance beats, but her songs are more flexible without that backbone. Rostron's Janis Joplin-like runs are able to cover the distance between melody and primal scream, leaving her free to exploit her entire expressive range. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>
    Have It All</em> is only one part of a three-part system (along with her costuming/performance and her videos). After all, the album's first track, ""The PTR Show"" welcomes you to her show, not her album. But <em>Have It All</em> is unique on its own, and sounds like nothing else that's come out this year. The Knife's <em>Silent Shout</em> could be a reference point (and Rostron has remixed a song for them) but their otherworldliness and theatrics alienate the listener. Rostron invites us to become a part of her alienation, and injects the experience with a sense of humor. It repulses as it beckons; the more you ignore her, the closer she gets.

While it isn't exactly lo-fi, it's far from polished-- and perhaps because Moore handpicked the songs from several demos, production value and style is highly erratic. Not to mention that out in the broad demographic, singers, perhaps unreasonably, are expected to be able to sing. In the strictest sense of the word, Tam can't: She treats key more like a suggestion than a rule. Flat stentorian vowels waver raucously between toothmarked consonants. It's no great stretch for the Silver Jews crowd, but to the John Mayer set, it's going to sound like Wesley Willis. Maybe Moore just liked the idea of horrified Borders patrons spewing breve foam onto listening stations.</p><p>
    If Tam's raw divagations fairly shout ""outsider artist,"" this is illusory-- she's been a fixture on the Montreal music scene since the 1990s, playing in Django Reinhardt and Oasis cover bands as well as her own Vampires; she wrote some lyrics for and toured with the Unicorns; and she told the <em>Montreal Mirror</em> that she made Régine Butler jealous by jamming with Win (the accompanying photo of the singer in a saucily modified Department of Corrections uniform lends credibility to the claim). In fact, she covers the Arcade Fire's ""Nocarsgo"" on her album, and while she plays it in her usual bare-bones style, it's reverent and heartfelt, the refrain of ""Between the click of the light and the start of the dream"" blending seamlessly with the gnomic snippets she wrote herself. So Tam's no fringe crazy, just a pop fan with a pragmatic punk sensibility born of a combination of technical limitation and compositional acuity.</p><p>
    Somewhere between Kurt Cobain and Exene Cervenka, Tam manages to evoke apathy, nihilism, and queasy romance at once, leavening her throttled lines with ridiculously catchy hooks. The garage rock stompers ""1000 Watts"" and ""Deadman Brings the Luck"" reveal how unexceptional Tam's music could be if she played it safe, dressing up her voice in the slacker-punk riffage it begs for, although the rock approach also produces one of the album's best songs, ""Incest at Best"". Over tooth-grinding guitars, Tam fully indulges her potential to sneer, and her lyrics glitter with the ecstasy of teenage depression: ""Incest at best/ It must have touched you somewhere/ We're so much less than friends."" But usually, she's better when she's exploring styles of music that suit her less obviously-- electro-pop, indie folk, digital psychedelia. Her gentler songs are especially effective because there's no timidity in her singing, but neither is there a sense of blustery caricature. She softens her burlap balloon of a voice with a counterintuitive tenderness, and it floats with endearing, awkward grace. On ""You're Not Mine"", we get a dreamy pulse, slide whistles, and aching vocals, striking a stark contrast to the brusque rock numbers. ""Top"" is depressive seether, darkly lagging and surging. ""Modern Man"" and ""Stop"" creak with damaged electronics, as Tam croaks winsomely amid the smoldering wreckage. Paradoxically, there's a daring nudity to these efforts that's absent from the superficially dangerous punk ones.
    </p><p>
    There are at least two kinds of singing: the technically refined kind we admire because we can't do it, and the weirdly poignant kind that reminds us of all the things we could do, if we had the conviction to try. The latter, a manifestation of beauty predicated upon sheer force of will rather than talent, is where Tam excels. She uses rudimentary tools to carve homely artifacts that have the quiet dignity and durable utility of handmade carpentry. They may not be much to look at it, but with their emphasis of function over form, they're a pleasure to settle into. <br/>

We are in a post-9/11     world, where American citizens hoard duct tape and look for     suspicious crop dusters, where we are at war,     the powers-that-be deliberately confused and conflated the reasons     for this war, and the most prominent members of the fourth     estate long avoided asking important questions.  A few     musicians have taken to asking some of these questions in their own     work, with mixed results.  Erase Errata-- frontwoman Jenny Hoyston     in particular-- has never shied from topical issues,     though a direct route from expression to meaning was rarely taken.      But, as President Bush has said so many times, things change.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">Back in the day (2001, to be exact),     Erase Errata were a four-piece quartet mixing and mashing together all     sorts of skronk and skree to create a glorious racket reminiscent of     a no-wave group going for the new-wave brass ring.  Hoyston     spit out imagistic lyrical fragments in a fashion that mirrored the     fret work of both guitarist Sara Jaffe and bassist Ellie Erickson,     while Bianca Sparta rumbled across her drumkit.  They recorded two     albums, they toured, they kicked ass.  But they hit a speed bum when     Jaffe decided to leave the group to attend graduate school.  Hoyston     took over on guitar, and while the group temporarily experimented     with a new (male) singer, the remaining trio decided to go it alone,     and spent two years trying to rediscover and, ultimately, redefine     themselves.  The result of that search is <i>Nightlife</i>,     a focused and more powerful version of the group's scattershot     aesthetic.  While it's not a drastic departure from previous works,     this album finds the group marshaling their powers to cut to the     quick both musically and lyrically.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">Previously, Hoyston's voice was just     another off-kilter instrument, joyously bounding about the racket her     bandmates created.  Her fragmented musics, while still audible, were     often subsumed either by the ruckus, low production values, or     megaphone static.  Now, Hoyston's words are exacting and precise, and     her voice is front and center.  Eli Crews and especially Chris     Woodhouse (a producer for the A-Frames) deserve credit for getting     the new Erase Errata down on tape so successfully, working perfectly     in tandem with Hoyston's lyrical approach.  When she says “Yes, I     really got away/ With murder, manslaughter/ All funded by my tax     dollar,” or “They've got a law in the desert ...where everybody     has a gun/ Everybody has a knife,” you hear what she's saying--     literally and metaphorically-- without question.  Any advantages lost     by Hoyston eschewing her trademark oblique phrasings are regained by     the blunt impact of the words.  In her most brilliantly simple     moment, Hoyston gets monosyllabic on the lesbionic love song “Take     You”. “I'm gonna take both of you/ To my secret cave,” she     coos, subverting the clichéd caveman-dragging-girl image (and, by     proxy, traditional gender roles) in multiple ways while the music     behind her bangs and booms like rocks on logs.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">Even on more impressionistic songs like     “Giant Hans” or “Cruising"", Hoyston cuts to the quick.  Hoyston's     trumpet is also employed sparingly, but precisely-- it sets a     mournful tone for the beginning of “Hotel Suicide”, and provides     some recognizable bleats on “Another Genius Idea”. This     less-is-more approach also applies to her work as a guitarist.      While Jaffe played guitar in a showy fashion, Hoyston uses the     instrument more often to accent the song with scrapes or brief     squalls.  Still, there are moments where she puts her foot on the     monitor to shred, such as the Sabbath-like break in “Dust”.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><i>Nightlife</i>, much     more than the other Erase Errata records, is all about the rhythm     section.  If there's a guitar hero to be had on <i>Nightlife</i>,     it's Erickson.  Her off-kilter plucking and mangling, in tandem with     Sparta's locked-down drumming, defines this album right from the     beginning.  It's to their credit that this mostly mournful or     menacing-sounding album rises above its own morass.  Sunshine and     lollipops aren't in great supply when denouncing U.S. foreign policy or     wiretapping programs, but the band's work on “Tax Dollar” and     “Another Genius Idea” keeps the message from ossifying.

Before they came along, many people still assumed that in order to make aggressive, energetic noises, the members of rock bands had to actually move around, do guitar windmills, and look engaged. The JAMC did not like this situation, because those poses tended to be either uncool or boring, and often made one look like a complete twat.</p>
<p>But after a brief scientific study of their equipment, it came to the JAMC’s attention that electric guitars, when paired with high amplifier volume and harmonic distortion, could create feedback, thereby producing aggressive noises mostly on their own, and freeing their actual players to stand around looking half dead, depressed, and generally too contemptuous and disgusted to really bother playing-- all of which seemed, in 1985 and in the particular case of the JAMC, totally super-awesome.</p>
<p>Obviously the drummer for such a group couldn’t sit behind a big kit looking like he knew what he was doing, so the JAMC stood Bobby Gillespie (yes, that one) up behind only two drums-- a floor tom and a snare-- and had him bash away like he was pissed off at them but either too bored or too drunk to finish them off. A similar approach was taken to bass guitar and vocals.</p>
<p>If the band had applied these tactics to knotty, difficult music, you would never have heard of them, and Dominique Leone would be reviewing these reissues. Luckily-- intuitively-- the JAMC wrote pop songs, basic three-chord rock’n’roll and all-hook melodies, vaguely in the style of early Beach Boys, girl groups, or the laid-back end of the Rolling Stones. Only...as played by lazy, spiteful, nearly hopeless people who didn’t care one way or the other and therefore covered the whole thing in screeching. (See also: the Velvet Underground.)</p>
<p>And thus we get <i>Psychocandy</i> (1985), the JAMC’s enduring contribution to the annals of rock history.</p>
<p>Sometimes people tell you that a 20-year-old album “sounded like nothing else,” but when you listen with today’s ears, it seems rather quaint and unsurprising. <i>Psychocandy</i> is not one of those albums. Its noise isn’t the thick, tactile noise of the new millennium: It’s thin, trebly, and drowned in indistinct reverb, such that this record <i>still</i> sounds like it’s being played in the apartment across the street at staggering volume while someone intermittently runs glass through a table saw. The music stumbles its way from stoned, lazy beauty (“Just Like Honey”) to speed-freak noise (“Never Understand”) to almost-bouncy pop (“Taste of Cindy”). Jim Reid chants his melodies in the selfish, mostly monosyllabic vocabulary of rock’n’roll (“I’m in love with myself,” “I don’t want you to need me,” “oh yeah,”). And just about every song comes out ideal: You’d think they’d sound like jerks, or toughs, and yet it all comes off so vulnerable, so pretty.</p>
<p>The UK loved it, and it’s worth asking why. One reason, I think, is that people in the stylish 80s were thrilled to see their own personal resurrection of the same rock’n’roll “cool” myth that runs through fellow heroin enthusiasts like the Stones, the Pistols, and Nirvana-- which is to say, a band that doesn’t seem to give a fuck about much, including pleasing its own audience, and thus lets that audience live out its own (sensibly unfulfilled) fantasies of alienated non-fuck-giving and antisocial moping. <i>Psychocandy</i> remains a perfect record for states of feeling so bratty, depressed, or disgusted that you actually start to enjoy it. Also, like with most heroin rock’n’roll bands, there’s an earnest, romantic belief in something beautiful and unattainable in the midst of it, which might be drug-related for them but doesn’t have to be for you. The many fun and pretty songs here still seem tired and hard-won, like the band’s grasping at beauty rather than just claiming it exists.</p>
<p>The JAMC also sent a couple massively influential messages to everyone else. One was that-- as mentioned-- you could make big noises without being or acting big. The other was a reminder that the ethos of a band could be wrapped up not in the notes or the songs they played, but in the actual <i>sound</i> of their records; that stuff could be content, not style. These lessons, put together, account for a good 75% of the shoegazer scene that followed.</p>
<p>With all of that accomplished, the JAMC’s next four albums were spent figuring out what in the world to do next. Decisions were made as follows:<i><br/> </i></p>
<p><i>Darklands</i> (1987): With Gillespie gone and replaced by an unobtrusive drum machine, the band turns down the noise attitude and works on developing the back-to-basics pop songs that were always underneath. The singles (“Happy When it Rains”) are a joy, big hooks laced with just the right amount of vintage leather-and-shades cool.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Automatic</i> (1989): Conventional wisdom wrongly calls this the dud. With the band reduced to the brothers only, things go artificial: The drum machine is foregrounded, the bass is played on keyboards, the feedback’s on vacation. In that space, the Reids take their biggest shot at doing full-on pop, something that-- on a global alternative classic like the Pixies-covered “Head On”-- feels like a career peak. The rockier album cuts get pretty turgid, and both Reids start to feel like parodies of themselves, but at points they fall into a synthetic rock grind that’s almost industrial-- fascinating, in a time-capsule kind of way.</p>
<p><i>Honey’s Dead</i> (1992): Conventional wisdom wrongly calls this the return to form, mostly because they got a drummer and wrote some lively tunes. The problem is that the well-recorded feedback and effortful Jagger yowling here sound like two guys straining to be cool, the exact thing that <i>Psychocandy</i> evaded. It’s also their first fully contemporary grunge-era record, so if you wanted to hear a rock band <i>try</i>, you could just buy something current.</p>
<p><i>Stoned and Dethroned</i> (1994): Back to the beauty thing-- the band breaks out a few acoustic guitars and settles gracefully into a bunch of drawling Stones-type numbers. How convenient that William was dating Hope Sandoval, of popular acoustic drawlers Mazzy Star: Her duet with Jim on ""Sometimes Always"" really is a standout.</p>
<p>And these five discs offer those five records, each remastered, and each with a DVD face on the flipside containing all relevant music videos and a hi-res album version.</p>
<p>There is only one warning that must go with them: Do not try this at home. Since the turn of the millennium, a staggering number of rock bands have put a staggering amount of effort into seeming like they don’t care. Some have studied the poses and sounds like engineers; others have reduced themselves to the point of intolerable blandness, all because actually <i>trying</i> something might leave them open to embarrassment, open to criticism.

Before they came along, many people still assumed that in order to make aggressive, energetic noises, the members of rock bands had to actually move around, do guitar windmills, and look engaged. The JAMC did not like this situation, because those poses tended to be either uncool or boring, and often made one look like a complete twat.</p>
<p>But after a brief scientific study of their equipment, it came to the JAMC’s attention that electric guitars, when paired with high amplifier volume and harmonic distortion, could create feedback, thereby producing aggressive noises mostly on their own, and freeing their actual players to stand around looking half dead, depressed, and generally too contemptuous and disgusted to really bother playing-- all of which seemed, in 1985 and in the particular case of the JAMC, totally super-awesome.</p>
<p>Obviously the drummer for such a group couldn’t sit behind a big kit looking like he knew what he was doing, so the JAMC stood Bobby Gillespie (yes, that one) up behind only two drums-- a floor tom and a snare-- and had him bash away like he was pissed off at them but either too bored or too drunk to finish them off. A similar approach was taken to bass guitar and vocals.</p>
<p>If the band had applied these tactics to knotty, difficult music, you would never have heard of them, and Dominique Leone would be reviewing these reissues. Luckily-- intuitively-- the JAMC wrote pop songs, basic three-chord rock’n’roll and all-hook melodies, vaguely in the style of early Beach Boys, girl groups, or the laid-back end of the Rolling Stones. Only...as played by lazy, spiteful, nearly hopeless people who didn’t care one way or the other and therefore covered the whole thing in screeching. (See also: the Velvet Underground.)</p>
<p>And thus we get <i>Psychocandy</i> (1985), the JAMC’s enduring contribution to the annals of rock history.</p>
<p>Sometimes people tell you that a 20-year-old album “sounded like nothing else,” but when you listen with today’s ears, it seems rather quaint and unsurprising. <i>Psychocandy</i> is not one of those albums. Its noise isn’t the thick, tactile noise of the new millennium: It’s thin, trebly, and drowned in indistinct reverb, such that this record <i>still</i> sounds like it’s being played in the apartment across the street at staggering volume while someone intermittently runs glass through a table saw. The music stumbles its way from stoned, lazy beauty (“Just Like Honey”) to speed-freak noise (“Never Understand”) to almost-bouncy pop (“Taste of Cindy”). Jim Reid chants his melodies in the selfish, mostly monosyllabic vocabulary of rock’n’roll (“I’m in love with myself,” “I don’t want you to need me,” “oh yeah,”). And just about every song comes out ideal: You’d think they’d sound like jerks, or toughs, and yet it all comes off so vulnerable, so pretty.</p>
<p>The UK loved it, and it’s worth asking why. One reason, I think, is that people in the stylish 80s were thrilled to see their own personal resurrection of the same rock’n’roll “cool” myth that runs through fellow heroin enthusiasts like the Stones, the Pistols, and Nirvana-- which is to say, a band that doesn’t seem to give a fuck about much, including pleasing its own audience, and thus lets that audience live out its own (sensibly unfulfilled) fantasies of alienated non-fuck-giving and antisocial moping. <i>Psychocandy</i> remains a perfect record for states of feeling so bratty, depressed, or disgusted that you actually start to enjoy it. Also, like with most heroin rock’n’roll bands, there’s an earnest, romantic belief in something beautiful and unattainable in the midst of it, which might be drug-related for them but doesn’t have to be for you. The many fun and pretty songs here still seem tired and hard-won, like the band’s grasping at beauty rather than just claiming it exists.</p>
<p>The JAMC also sent a couple massively influential messages to everyone else. One was that-- as mentioned-- you could make big noises without being or acting big. The other was a reminder that the ethos of a band could be wrapped up not in the notes or the songs they played, but in the actual <i>sound</i> of their records; that stuff could be content, not style. These lessons, put together, account for a good 75% of the shoegazer scene that followed.</p>
<p>With all of that accomplished, the JAMC’s next four albums were spent figuring out what in the world to do next. Decisions were made as follows:<i><br/> </i></p>
<p><i>Darklands</i> (1987): With Gillespie gone and replaced by an unobtrusive drum machine, the band turns down the noise attitude and works on developing the back-to-basics pop songs that were always underneath. The singles (“Happy When it Rains”) are a joy, big hooks laced with just the right amount of vintage leather-and-shades cool.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Automatic</i> (1989): Conventional wisdom wrongly calls this the dud. With the band reduced to the brothers only, things go artificial: The drum machine is foregrounded, the bass is played on keyboards, the feedback’s on vacation. In that space, the Reids take their biggest shot at doing full-on pop, something that-- on a global alternative classic like the Pixies-covered “Head On”-- feels like a career peak. The rockier album cuts get pretty turgid, and both Reids start to feel like parodies of themselves, but at points they fall into a synthetic rock grind that’s almost industrial-- fascinating, in a time-capsule kind of way.</p>
<p><i>Honey’s Dead</i> (1992): Conventional wisdom wrongly calls this the return to form, mostly because they got a drummer and wrote some lively tunes. The problem is that the well-recorded feedback and effortful Jagger yowling here sound like two guys straining to be cool, the exact thing that <i>Psychocandy</i> evaded. It’s also their first fully contemporary grunge-era record, so if you wanted to hear a rock band <i>try</i>, you could just buy something current.</p>
<p><i>Stoned and Dethroned</i> (1994): Back to the beauty thing-- the band breaks out a few acoustic guitars and settles gracefully into a bunch of drawling Stones-type numbers. How convenient that William was dating Hope Sandoval, of popular acoustic drawlers Mazzy Star: Her duet with Jim on ""Sometimes Always"" really is a standout.</p>
<p>And these five discs offer those five records, each remastered, and each with a DVD face on the flipside containing all relevant music videos and a hi-res album version.</p>
<p>There is only one warning that must go with them: Do not try this at home. Since the turn of the millennium, a staggering number of rock bands have put a staggering amount of effort into seeming like they don’t care. Some have studied the poses and sounds like engineers; others have reduced themselves to the point of intolerable blandness, all because actually <i>trying</i> something might leave them open to embarrassment, open to criticism. Don’t try this at home: These days we could use more of the opposite end of the 80s, the unembarrassed striving and the unselfconscious quirk.</p></div>"|11882.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11882-psychocandy-darklands-automatic-honeys-dead-stoned-dethroned/|7.6|Nitsuh Abebe

    Covers albums can be more than a little indulgent. But they can also give listeners some salacious insight into what makes a songwriter tick; it's kind of like perusing the bookshelves of your favorite author. Composed of covers from the band's EPs and singles, the lovingly compiled <em>Lunafied</em>, which is available exclusively as a digital download, works precisely in that way. There's scarcely an essential interpretation or jaw-dropping overhaul of any of the material. But it's an opportunity to observe the kinds of songs Dean Wareham is attracted to in one tidy package and play connect-the-dots with a host of diverse influences.</p><p>
    Wareham has always been a fan of covers. With Galaxie 500, he recorded hazy renditions of songs by Young Marble Giants, New Order, Yoko Ono, the Modern Lovers, and, of course, the Velvet Underground. Perhaps unsurprisingly, both the Velvets and the Modern Lovers figure among the 14 covers on <em>Lunafied</em>. Wareham's allegiance to the three-chord composition places him in a logical lineage with the work of Lou Reed and Velvets-obsessive Jonathon Richman. On ""Ride into the Sun"", taken from the <em>Slide</em> EP, Wareham and Co. manage to transform the <em>Loaded</em>-era outtake into a song more typical of the Velvet Underground. In its version, Luna dumps the organ, the chorus and the ""It's hard to live in the city"" coda for a slow-paced and sprawling workout full of searching guitar solos.</p><p>
    As the album's title suggests, Luna does make the songs it covers its own, even if the band's reworking of the material is often faithful. For example, effects-laden guitars stand in for vocal harmonies on Blondie's ""In the Flesh"" and Wareham's modest, nasal delivery replaces Harry Nilsson's emotive croon on ""Everybody's Talkin'"", but the essence of the originals remain in tact. One exception is Luna's take on Beat Happening's ""Indian Summer"", which, like ""Ride Into the Sun"", stretches the song out into an epic guitar workout. In this version, Wareham speak-sings the wistfully nostalgic lyrics, letting the imagery sink in over expansive layers of guitar. By contrast, Calvin Johnson's croaking, unimpassioned delivery in the original made his words sound like haphazard rhymes, undermining the sweetly innocent portrait of summer that they paint.
    </p>
<p>
    While there is plenty of variation in the songs, which range from Donovan to Wire, a few patterns in Wareham's choices do emerge. There's an ample sampling of New York New Wave, as Luna tackles Blondie, Talking Heads (""Thank You for Sending Me an Angel""), and Suicide (""Dream Baby Dream""). And Wareham can't resist a couple opportunities to show off his French on Michel Polnareff's ""La Poupee Qui Fait Non"" and the two versions of Serge Gainsbourg's ""Bonnie and Clyde"", in which Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier plays Brigitte Bardot to Wareham's Serge. There are also a few omissions, most notably Luna's versions of Kraftwerk's ""Neon Lights"" and G ‘n' f'n R's ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" But, in the end, it's a strong collection of covers that showcases Wareham's excellent taste and reminds how underrated Luna truly were.

Amazing, then, that he did not even see music as his central life’s work. That, he felt, was working the land and tending to his family. He held true to this belief strongly, spending most of the last decade of his life in his northern Mali hometown of Niafunké and “retiring” from the spotlight more times than Roger Clemens. He was elected mayor of Niafunké in 2004, and claimed he’d only return to music if duly inspired.</p><p>
    It was around that same time he was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer, against which he’d struggle for his final two years. Somewhere in that fight against disease, he found inspiration, and channeled it into his final work, a collaboration with kora player Toumani Diabate (<em>In the Heart of the Moon</em>) and <em>Savane</em>, recorded simultaneously by longtime Touré producer Nick Gold at Bamako’s Mandé Hotel. <em>In the Heart of the Moon</em> won him his second Grammy just weeks before his death, while <em>Savane</em> stands as his posthumous defining statement, a deeply felt album that stands among his best.</p><p>
    The album flows like a river, at times, tumultuous, at others placid, but always full of life and movement. Mixing his instantly identifiable electric guitar sound with a band that includes bamboo flute, ngoni (a four-stringed lute), traditional percussion instruments and a one-stringed violin called an njarka (all of which Touré himself played well), he conjures an elemental thrum on <em>Savane</em> as organic as the soil of his farm. Harmonica and saxophone make cameos, and Touré’s raw, powerful voice is answered by understated chants and choral vocals.
    </p><p>
    Album opener “Erdi” is a mesmerizing swirl of American and African blues, matching hypnotic rhythms with scorching blues harp and ragged guitars. The music is intense and sharply focused, and Touré sings as though in a trance. Surely he was aware that these were the last notes he would commit to tape, and he makes them count. Touré spoke seven regional languages, and this album bestrides the music associated with all of them, especially his own Sonrai people and the Kel Tamashek, better known as the Tuareg, of extreme northern Mali. It seems that modern Saharan bands like Tinariwen and Etran Finitawa learned much from Touré.
    </p>
<p>
    One of the most powerhouse performances of Touré’s entire long career comes on the remarkable title track, a song that capitalizes on the contrast between restraint and baroque flourish. The rhythm is simple, repetitive, and quiet, just a few chords played on guitar, and Touré’s raspy vocal is similarly controlled. Meanwhile, his focused electric guitar solos spar with a wild, almost totally unchecked kora part.
    </p>
<p>
    Touré was never supposed to be a musician-- his noble lineage discouraged it-- but he claimed that he was drawn to its power, and so became a musician by calling. On <em>Savane</em>, his final recordings demonstrate how well he was able to wield that power. It is beautiful, emotive music, literally and figuratively entrancing. Touré may be gone, but on this album you get the sense that he is still very much with us, and that his spirit is in no danger of fading.

One wishes that he would. Few comedians are as nimble and imaginative, but Mirman oversettles for the slapdash and scattershot. Perhaps his loving, ""in the know"" audiences aren't offering him enough of a challenge-- this disc captures folks full-on cackling at ho-hummers-- but he could easily morph into a titan if he concentrated on the friction between Mirman the humor artiste and Mirman the mere entertainer.</p><p>
    Mirman ""gets political,"" but thankfully, he lacks Lenny Bruce's self-absorption and Bill Hicks' lone-rebel shtick. He riffs on pop surreality and isn't afraid to crowd-please, but he never ventures into the safety-first, Abercrombie &amp; Fetchit consumer-hoedown of Dane Cook. But (to be presumptuous) some nugget of slacker cowardice seems to be holding him back from taking more interesting risks than wallowing in TV minutiae and making glib (but okay, funny) sport of Republicans and Christians. His bit on the New Testament's being repackaged as a teen magazine is all but plagiarized from multiple primary-source routines that David Cross did with Christian pamphlets, dating guides, and sandwich liners.</p><p>
    One's heart goes out to Mirman, though: Reality competes fiercely with his fantasias, and he appears lazy next to it. That the New Testament was actually repackaged as a teen magazine is so hilarious; Mirman's like a guy at a car wreck autopsy pointing out that the proceedings are kind of gross. His first album was called <em>The Absurd Nightclub Comedy Of...</em>, but his absurdity isn't the alienated, despair-at-irrationality kind. Rather, he comes across as adrift in pop cultural dross. This album's title testifies that he doubts comedy's revolutionary power. ""Society"" once saw fit to fear comedians: sounding almost like Hitler's invections against degenerate painters, Time magazine ran a story in 1959 on the mostly (like Cross and Mirman) Jewish stand-ups, calling them ""Sickniks"" and citing their ""disturbing hostility to the world."" Certainly 2006 is as anxiously provocative a time to be alive as 1959, yet Mirman is (okay, hilariously) targeting VH-1? And the short films on the accompanying DVD are a snooze; several of them circulate via YouTube. A funnier time can be had playing the <em>Requiem For a Dream</em> soundtrack while watching that video of televangelist Pat Robertson leg pressing a thousand pounds.</p><p>
    Consumption links Mirman's greatest non-sequiturs, such as jokes about burgers stuffed with failure and trading abortion anesthesia for Papa John's pizza. He can mine his Russian Jewish heritage without getting everything all illuminated. He deeply resents false authorities. He's not as misanthropic as Sarah Silverman. But when he's only ""cute"" or ""silly,"" listening to this disc is a poor substitute for a conversation with a witty friend. Hopefully your life is vivid and your crew produces enough observational banter to prevent you from having to outsource your yucks by purchasing any but the most deliberate comedy commodities. Where's the danger, Mirman? Where's the focus? In pop's own haggard terms: This plane needs more mothafuckin snakes.<br/></p></div>"|9253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9253-en-garde-society/|6.7|William Bowers

    Furnaces for any number of reasons: too many 
    keyboards, fleeting pop moments lost amidst elaborate 
    arrangements, unusual vocals, wordy lyrics, the 
    insulting concept that an album might grow better with 
    time rather than be immediately accessible.  Suffice 
    it to say that I don't agree with any of those 
    arguments, but I'm certainly not so fanboy-blind as to 
    foolishly believe the Friedbergers' music will or should be 
    universally accepted.  Yet what has become abundantly 
    clear over the band's prolific four-year existence 
    is that it's averse to 
    compromise, despite the divisive response that 
    attitude tends to breed.</p><p>
    One might suppose that solo album(s) from 
    the chief Furnaces songwriter Matthew Friedberger would magnify his flaws/assets, 
    and in the case of <em>Winter Women</em> and <em>Holy Ghost 
    Language School</em>, one would be correct.  The first albums released under his given 
    name reflect an even less compromised vision than the 
    comparatively commercial (chortle) work of his day 
    job.  Alone in the studio (save some drum parts from 
    Tortoise's John McEntire), Friedberger is free to indulge his 
    obsessions with offbeat production and musical 
    storytelling, to different degrees of success between 
    the two records.</p><p>
    A major tenet of the Friedberger philosophy has been 
    to grant each album a unique sound, and here <em>Winter 
    Women</em> is designated the pop record, while <em>Holy Ghost</em> 
    carries the label of rock opera.  Nevertheless, <em>Winter 
    Women</em>’s popness is only relative to previous Furnaces’ 
    efforts, sporting structures less likely to suddenly 
    veer down unexpected routes but thick with instrumental and lyrical peculiarities.  The 
    straightforward melodies of ""Up the River"" or ""Ruth 
    vs. Rachel"" rudely abut against the disorienting 
    drum-machine clatter of ""PS 213 Mini School"" or the 
    jarring guitar solos of ""I Love You Cedric"".
    </p><p>
    Throughout <em>Winter Women</em>, Friedberger explores the denser sound the Furnaces have 
    gradually approached over their career, sometimes to 
    the point of overcooking-- songs like “Under the Hood 
    at the Paradise Garage” suffer from one keyboard too 
    many being added to the mix.  Often the instruments 
    threaten to overwhelm Friedberger’s voice entirely, 
    low in volume and prone to muttered spoken-word 
    asides.  The muddy sonics make moments of simplicity, 
    like the soft mellotron on ""Hialeah"" or ""Quick as 
    Cupid""'s wistful vocal, particularly welcome reminders 
    of the songwriter’s restrained-by-necessity 
    <em>Gallowsbird's Bark</em> days.
    </p>
<p>
    No such respites are to be found in <em>Holy Ghost 
    Language School</em>, Friedberger's second album-length 
    narrative after the polarizing <em>Rehearsing My Choir</em>. 
    The story of one Scot Dombrowski, a Pentecostal 
    businessman who starts a school for using speaking in 
    tongues for business negotiation purposes in China 
    (obviously), it’s a plot that makes <em>Rehearsing My 
    Choir</em> look like an episode of ""The Golden Girls"".  Further 
    boosting the ambition, Friedberger also lets his music 
    do the talking in a lot of places, substituting 
    extended instrumental passages for exposition along 
    the lines of ""Sparks"" from <em>Tommy</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, combined with the once-again quiet 
    radio-play vocals, this method makes the story 
    extremely difficult to follow, a struggle that isn’t 
    helped much by the liner-note lyrics.  The record also 
    sounds sucked dry of the pop talent Friedberger 
    usually preserves amidst his conceptual wanderings, 
    filled with dizzying smears of drum machines run amok and backwards vocals, with ominous piano riffs running in loops on the instrumental segments.  Without many 
    melodic islands to look forward to, trying to sort out 
    the plot becomes something of a chore, appropriate as 
    the discomforting sound may be to the themes of the 
    album. Thus, the downside of the ""every album should have a 
    different sound"" policy may be, carrying with it the 
    risk of producing the occasional stumble, a record 
    which is weighed down by religious dedication to its 
    concept or sound.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Blueberry Boat</em> still stands as 
    Friedberger's finest accomplishment due to the 
    multiplicity of angles from which it can be enjoyed; 
    as a distant echo of British Invasion rock, as 
    exploration of a pop song's limitations, as an 
    evocative collection of musical stories.  <em>Winter Women</em> 
    and <em>Holy Ghost Language</em>, with their more narrow aims, 
    each represent only a fraction of that whole, and as 
    such may provide Furnaces haters with more ammunition 
    than their defenders.

    Fans of overlapping covers can, now more than ever, safely play Six Degrees of Jamie Stewart as the <em>Tu Mi Piaci</em> EP-- the title means, ""I like you""-- adds four new renditions of classics and subclassics (and five covers altogether) to a repertoire that previously included the work of Joy Division, Pixies, Tracy Chapman, the Smiths, Devendra Banhart, Nick Cave, and Throwing Muses. For example, in Six Degrees, the category of hip-hop is now wide open. You can suddenly link Xiu Xiu to Kanye West, Talib Kweli, and countless other rappers who sample Nina Simone since Stewart has droningly and gorgeously covered her (not to mention Jim Guthrie, 16 Horsepower, and Cat Power).</p><p>
    If your opponent challenges you to link Xiu Xiu to the Violent Femmes, then all you have to say is that Gnarls Barkley covered the Femmes' ""Gone Daddy Gone"", and that act's singer, Cee-Lo Green, wrote ""Don't Cha"" in 2004 for (Outkast backup singer) Tori Alamaze, who got covered/robbed by the prefab Pussycat Dolls. And then you if play a lightning round in which you switch the organizing principle from covers to mash-ups, ""Don't Cha"" is like some universal ore, having been garter-belted and bootlegged up against Bloc Party, the Human League, Black Eyed Peas, Juliette &amp; the Licks, the White Stripes, Jimi Hendrix, and many others. (David Letterman even used the song as a false update on the crisis/war
    in the Middle East, having his announcer preen across the stage and
    tease the audience with his unbuttoned hotness and rawness.)</p><p>
    Stewart's elegantly industrial handling of that fabled track is going to be called ""weird,"" but only because he did it. The original track was already plenty deviant-- I mean, undermining someone's fidelity to an established relationship with such carnal come-ons is just plain uncivil. Some folks will resent Stewart's take as ""artsy,"" whereas the Pussycat Dolls' was ""pop,"" and thus supposedly not a thinkpiece. I see similar responses when, in my day job as a teacher, I have my students read Joe Wenderoth's <em>Letters to Wendy's</em> in which a man makes love to a Frosty. Students claim to be appalled by such perversity. Then I inquire how many of them own the DVD of that hilarious romp about the boy fucking an American pie, and their hands go up like I'd asked them who wanted five dollars.
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, Stewart does soft justice (complete with some ingenious household/studio clamor) to Alex Chilton's pleading ""Kangaroo"", giving 4AD props by citing it as a cover of This Mortal Coil's cover. Forgive my identity politics, but I wish that the family-beguiled Stewart had done ""You And Your Sister"", the song by Chilton's tortured gay Big Starmate Chris Bell that This Mortal Coil also interpreted. Ah well, sometimes a mozzarella stick is just a mozzarella stick.
    </p>
<p>
    The showstopper is the version of Bauhaus' ""All We Ever Wanted Was Everything"". The stand-up bass and flinchy strings at first suggest some synthesis of Arthur Russell and Final Fantasy, and then the tune settles into a sexy torch song. Stewart's voice is familiarly about to burst with longing but it is unusually controlled-- like a Chet Baker tune from a spazzier <em>Let's Get Lost</em>, without the muted trumpets. I even thought of a recent session by Elvis Costello on Marian McPartland's radio show ""Piano Jazz"", and how my esteem for it made me feel a million years old. Oh but then: at the halfway point, Stewart spoofs Peter Murphy's imperious, wizardy intonation and a wall of distortion and screeches rides out the back half in explosive glory.
    </p>
<p>
    This project comes across as unrandom, in that these songs seem to set up the subject matter of forthcoming long-player <em>The Air Force</em>, which eases up on abused children and concentrates on unrequited adult desire. <em>Tu Mi Piaci</em> is arterial, whereas <em>The Air Force</em> is ventricular? At any rate, I say we name Stewart's genre ""glom"" and thank him for this appetizer, even if he denied us his inevitable ""Blue Monday"" and his whole aesthetic is, you know, morbid hunger.

    The Long Winters frontman-cum-producer John Roderick may
    have spent formative years in Anchorage, Alaska but there’s nothing overtly chilly about the Seattle quartet’s third full-length, <em>Putting the Days to Bed</em>.<span> </span>Never mind that on “Hindsight” Roderick
    deliberates about holding a snowball of a girl and croons about “craving the
    sun” (all in that crazy awesome voice of his: part dude from Okkervil River,
    part Craig Finn), this stuff’s about as wintry as possible,
    arriving mid-summer as balmy noise for the heat-waved and bummed vacation-reeling.<span> </span>Since 2002’s <em>The Worst You Can Do Is Harm</em>, the Long Winters have made names for
    themselves as purveyors of hard-to-pigeonhole, mostly likeable-- if not staunchly
    consistent-- pop.<span> </span>The back-to-back
    bounciness(es) of “Fire Island, AK”
    and “Teaspoon” on <em>Putting the Days to Bed
    </em>are further proof of the band’s leanings toward not so much power pop or
    even necessarily <em>powerful</em> pop-- just
    powered up pop, all horns and echoes and toe-tapping parties.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But emotional pick-me-ups these aren’t, per se: With
    Roderick, everything’s about “me” and “you,” either angsty correspondence/confrontation
    or words to the wise.<span> </span>“(It’s a)
    Departure” finds him explaining, “I like the old days/ But not all the old
    days/ Only the good old days”: With <em>Putting
    the Days to Bed</em>, L-Dubs’ trademark aural cheeriness hasn’t vanished-- if anything, it’s
    even upped-- but Roderick’s songwriting, here, is at its best and maybe
    bleakest.<span> </span>Lyrically, the album concerns
    itself with let-downs and hard truths concerned with what suckers humans really
    are: sad affinities for self-destruction (on “Hindsight” he asks “Is this new
    move just to keep moving?” and bails water out of a pretty but dilapidated boat
    because he likes the shape of it) and insatiable idealism and whatever.<span> </span>On “Honest,” at the album’s center, a mother
    tells her daughter: “Honest, it’s all right to be a singer, but don’t you love a
    singer, whatever you do” followed by what sounds like a choir reiterating
    “whatever you do”, like an updated “Que Sera” for a would-be groupie.<span> </span>Lines off <em>Putting
    the Days to Bed </em>are mostly hit or miss (misses come across as standard,
    petty gripes) but at their finest, they’re beautiful: “Did you see me the way I
    imagined? Every eyelash a picket or a wire?”<span> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The most anthemic and orchestral approach something only one stop shy of the grandiose gloom of ""Do You Realize?"" and the Long Winters are closer than they've ever been to perfectly executing the huge sounding sad song.  Still, they miss the masterful mark: Maybe it’s that there are too many wannabe huge songs stuck
    side-by-side, maybe they’re dwarfed in the process, maybe those kamikaze echoes
    wind up more grating than agreeable.<span>
</span>Regardless, <em>Putting the Days to
    Bed</em> is a solid effort-- a step in a promising new direction.

His Vancouver-based quartet Ladyhawk-- which occasionally enlists the vocal and percussive skills of Black Mountaineers Josh Wells and Amber Webber-- may have much in common with their better-known Vancouver peers (namely a love of Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse's <em>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</em>, and an aversion to razors), but this isn't a record for getting high; it's for crashing down.</p><p>
    You can hear it right there in Driediger's voice: in stark contrast to Stephen McBean's smoke-ring sighs and druganaut jokesterism, Driediger is forthright and at times brutally frank. (Remember this doozy for your next break-up: ""Your looks are fading fast/ So fuck who you will."") His band doesn't make his barbed sentiments any easier to swallow: Ladyhawk songs are loud but sparse, and seemingly delivered with a pained grimace, as if the players were all suffering from food poisoning. Seven-minute centerpiece ""Long 'Til the Morning""-- a nocturnal stoner blues that bears the closest resemblance to the company Ladyhawk keep-- sets the album's unhurried pace, with a thick-fog atmosphere that makes the song's Floydian guitar-solo climax all the more startling. But not all of Ladyhawk's slow-motion workouts employ such effectively dramatic devices: when sequenced together, grunged-up invectives like ""Advice"" and ""Sad Eyes/Blue Eyes"" feel sluggish, and make you less inclined to entertain Driediger's post-relationship purging.</p><p>
    Fortunately, Ladyhawk work up just enough energy to overcome the lethargy: clap-along pop gallop ""My Old Jacknife"" evokes fellow Vancouverites the New Pornographers if only by osmosis, while ""Teenage Love Song"" plays like a brash, amped-up update of Big Star's ""Thirteen"" (""Meet me outside the skating rink/ Your mama's a bitch, I don't care what she thinks of me""). But if Ladyhawk are to soar above Mountains both Black and Pink alike, it'll be because of one song: ""The Dugout"", an open-freeway anthem that, if we are to extend the titular baseball metaphor, is Driediger's first grand slam, and perhaps the most affecting display of sensitive-guy southern rock since Kings of Leon's ""California Waiting"", or even .38 Special's ""Caught Up in You"". This is the song that fans will be hollering for at all Ladyhawk gigs till the end of time-- their very own ""Freebird"", complete with orgiastic guitar finale (at only a third of the length). Boys, keep swinging.</p></div>"|9249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9249-ladyhawk/|7.1|Stuart Berman

    I've begun to envy the 16-year-olds who get to live with and cry on the shoulders of Ashlee or Skye and not feel the least bit sleazy or bad about it. Teenpop is riding a creative wave right now, but that doesn't mean grown-ups should try and hang 10.  In teenpop, the old suck the vitality, spontaneity, the sheer unselfconsciousness from the young.  Grown men wait for their MySpace queries to be personally answered by jailbait like Brie Larson, or endlessly discussing, on internet forums and elsewhere, the personal lives of starlets too young to have their last names printed in public spaces.  This is ugly stuff, even if there are a lot of smart critics trying to point these guys in at least the right musical directions.</p><p>
    And one could ask: Should a grown-man go out of his way to critically beat up on sensitive teenagers, even if said grown man has at least had the grace to avoid the music videos and other uncomfortable, potentially illegal forms of gawking?  Even worse: Can we criticize kids for not being enough like kids without sounding like a bunch of sleazy pedophiles, even if we're talking about music and not sex?</p><p>
    Meg &amp; Dia are the newest twin-poppers to turn 21 and 19, respectively, out in the hot and burning public eye, but they come bearing the best defense of all: They already sound depressingly old. Unlike recent records from bands such as Be Your Own Pet, who sound enticingly young and psyched about it, or the mostly-grown Joan Jett wannabies Damone, who sound accidentally young and psyched about it, Meg &amp; Dia sound just plain adult; worse, they sound like they're as bored with being grown-up as the rest of us are.  That's a far cry from Ashlee and her peers, who are constantly, inevitably, if accidentally, wearing their hearts on a very public sleeve.  Meg &amp; Dia at least had the right idea, naming their newest record <em>Something Real</em>.  But the title feels like a lie.
    </p>
<p>
    Like Aly &amp; AJ or the Veronicas or M2M before them, Meg &amp; Dia are two siblings (or close-enoughs) who grew up playing music together. Unlike their contemporaries, they write songs about ""the two ‘L's': love and literature.""  The younger one, Dia, sings, and the older one, Meg, writes the songs and plays them on her guitar.  Goofy, nerdy kids like these starting bands this young should be ruling the world.  Instead they're playing adult contemporary for the parents of their target audience.
    </p>
<p>
    For one thing, what's more grown up or boring than singing about books? Their lead single, ""Monster"", in addition to being alterna-guitared schlock, is apparently about something by Steinbeck; another song, ""Indiana"", is named after the novel by George Sand.  And though the latter's not bad-- snakily melodic guitars segue, more than once, into Smashing Pumpkins ""Today"" guitars, and even breakdown into shredding, stuttering palm-muted guitars-- it's not nearly as assertive as you'd want it to be. Courtney Love might be the ideal model for these young angry women, but Dia tends to sing like she's doing karaoke, not getting things off her chest.  And when she does manage to raise her voice, as on ""Masterpiece"", it's about not lost love but god: The chorus asks, ""Aren't you glad that you're the one that made me?""  Nothing wrong with god-- but face it, he's right up there with books when it comes to prurient interest.  For youthful vigor, then, we're left with ""Nineteen Stars"", on which both of the sisters sing, and is a nice piece of bubblegrunge about wishing on stars for boys.  But the track is an exception, not the rule.
    </p>
<p>
    So how creepy is it to wish they sounded younger?  Most sensible people value teenpop not for the age of those who make it but for its pristine and easily consumable values: crisp production, sugary harmonies and Max Martin melodies, a sheer upbeat exhilaration.  But it's no coincidence that kids make this kind of music more frequently than adults, Avril Lavigne excepted.  They're just less bored than we are.  So surely, lurking somewhere under the AOR balladry and platitudes are Meg &amp; Dia. And it might even be admirable that they're trying to tackle something beyond the high school bullshit that Dia ended up missing anyway, after dropping out to join her sister's band.  If only <em>Something Real</em> didn't sound like what teenpop usually doesn't-- shiny but without a hint of any kind of heart, young or otherwise.

My rare and unreleased tracks, demos, B-sides, live performances, videos, and valuable ephemera?"" I hear your cries, and I feel your pain. If you need consolation, however, try putting on the <em>Inches</em> DVD-- you know, the one you watched half of once?-- to reaffirm your devotion. <em>3/5</em>, Les Savy Fav's debut album, has been reissued for the oldest and dullest of reasons: It up and went out of print.</p><p>
    The new art is a clever facsimile of the original vinyl that actually came packaged inside three shower caps (which was actually a terrible idea if you ever planned to listen to it). Your legacy is not at the forefront of your mind when you're wrapping your first record in bath gear, and listening back to <em>3/5</em> only makes this clearer. ""Teen Anthem"" is not quite as advertised, and the band's original two-guitar setup made a noise that was convincing, if not so discernible from the other noise of the time. ""Cut It Out"" shows singer Tim Harrington's ability for turning nearly any innocuous couplet into a come-on or a manifesto (I'd long misheard a lyric from ""Pluto"" as, ""Every song's a sex commercial."" If only that were true: I couldn't be more concise than that.) Despite Harrington-brand non sequiturs, ""J'Taime"" is the album's real anthem, though nearly any lyric would sound that way over that track's cutting sobriety. In between, there's a non-stop saturation of jagged guitars that often lags without the dynamics of the band's later work.  The record's lost none of its bite or charm-- and I've always appreciated of the vicious rhythms of ""Cut It Out"" or ""Scouts Honor""-- but it's still a long way from the confidence in their songs and in the studio exhibited on <em>Go Forth</em>, or the bold <em>Inches</em> compilation.</p><p>
    I get all moist in the face reading the list of comrades in the ""Chorus"" section of the faithfully reprinted liner notes-- the Make-Up, Brainiac, Trans Am-- but the Fav were still playing catch-up at this point, not quite redefining their influences like they would from the <em>Emor</em> EP onward. While LSF managed to cram more then enough mania, muscle, sexual frustration, and French-speaking people into their record to instantly assert themselves as a cut above the rest, <em>3/5</em> is outshined by each of the band's subsequent releases. It's a shame that a merely great record gets dusted by a band that improved with every step, but there you have it. There's just a little more punk here than personality, the twin-guitar crunch overcrowding Harrington's delivery and the band's more distinctive corners. A pre-DFA James Murphy recorded the album, but the reissue sounds as unvarnished as it ever did. <em>3/5</em> does its best to capture the raucousness of their live show, but Les Savy Fav records only got really interesting once they realized they didn't have to. <em>3/5</em> is a document of the undocumentable; coming up short was just inevitable.
    </p><p>
    Tim Harrington's behavior at shows has become so consistently unpredictable that all fans must trade anecdotes and all reviewers feel inclined to include their favorites. But back then, they were playing to small audiences, and those audiences weren't into moving. I've always thought Harrington's extremism was nothing but inclusive in spirit, but would that reckless shtick have developed if most backs weren't turned? Would Les Savy Fav have pushed themselves so hard in concert if digital pictures and smoke-blowing live reports were showing up on a dozen blogs the following day?  And would they have pushed themselves in the studio in the same way, or rested on their laurels, as they have now that everyone knows about which curly hairs your face might get rubbed in if you're too close to the front of a Savy Fav show?
    </p>

    Pitchfork writer ""Chip"" Chanko wasn't misled in his enthusiasm when this was originally handed an 8.2. However, I knock it back a few tenths for how it measures up to the rest of the catalog now, and maybe a couple more for a lack of extras-- an oversight that's hard to complain about considering this was seriously out of print. Don't get me wrong: Every savvy Fan should own this, should have ""J'Taime"" and ""Blackouts"" mentally marked for their own internal best-of comps, and should know just what 1970s omni-hit they're quoting in the beginning of ""Cut It Out"". These details are so essential that you can take them for granted, just assuming the record's on your hard drive and moving on. Some extras would have been rad, yeah, but there's no need to see the naked baby pics when these
    guys, now full-grown, are still wearing tin foil hats and putting cucumbers in their Speedos. This record-- a sweet souvenir from the last word-of-mouth band-- is just sweetly awkward enough as it is.

The brevity of the thing proves it. Everyone knows EPs are better than albums. TV on the Radio will probably go on to release 14 masterpieces but never top <em>Young Liars</em>. It's simple: The music you don't make is only as good as the music you do, never worse. The greatest song ever &gt; the greatest album ever. I didn't make the rules.</p><p>
<em>Rides the Subway</em> starts with concussive locked-elbow drumming and someone yelling, ""That's right, we came to party,"" over West Coast G-rap synth squiggles. It ends 15 minutes later in dreamy ocarina echoes, the urge to go bananas supplanted somewhere along by the pull of reflection. I love music that covers big ground in small time without feeling rushed or overambitious. It's like the <em>Star Trek</em> fantasy of traversing the Universe on button's push.</p><p>
    Ironists dig campy pop because they think it's stupid fun, but <em>brainless</em> more accurately describes it. The fun comes not from thinking stupidly but from not thinking at all. This NYC quartet does plenty of thinking, primarily about how to have fun, which is a stupid way to use a real brain and a great way to use a musical one. ""Champion"" lays into a totally discombobulated groove, rim clicks slipping in and out of phase, someone (probably the frontman) playing sloppy frontman tambourine, the actual drummer pounding quarter notes with leaden feet. There's skill involved, don't doubt it-- these boys got their anti-finesse down pat. The beat sweats but never drags, bassdrops like falling cinder blocks. For a song that's basically all rhythm-- and stiff, juddery rhythm at that-- the band still churn up huge atmosphere, using synths to evoke sputtering computers. </p><p>
    Despite the rhythm-heavy opener, Professor Murder aren't a drum circle or conga line. To wit, ""The Mountain"" foregrounds the band's melodic component: two bassists and, here, a purple-faced melodica blower. Bullhorn-shouted lines like, ""50 dollar check, KRS-One,"" aren't exactly euphonious but they temper the percussion's aggressiveness and probably incite live crowds to clap offbeat. (This must happen a lot at Professor Murder shows.) The mellowed-out ""Free Stress Test"" closes this eyeblink-quick song cycle, and it's where the band finally showcases its songwriting muscle. The synths here lay down colorful, trance-inducing textures, as opposed to the cacophonous blips and whirls on ""Champion"". Bass, vocals, and percussion all quiet down in deference to the melody, the drummer even resting his foot for a few bars. It's as if the dudes caught something fiery and beautiful shooting across the sky and have huddled together to watch it.</p></div>"|9254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9254-rides-the-subway-ep/|8.3|Sam Ubl

    Will Holland
    comes at music from every conceivable angle: producer, listener, record
    collector, musician, and DJ. As Quantic, he brings all of those angles together
    into a relentlessly funky sound that seamlessly mixes live playing, programming,
    and sampling. Since debuting in 2000, he's been implausibly
    prolific-- in addition to numerous producing and remixing engagements, he's cut
    three albums as Quantic, two as Quantic Soul Orchestra, and another as half of
    the Limp Twins. <em>An Announcement to Answer</em>
    is the fourth straight-up Quantic album, and it finds Holland headed further down the Latin-flavored path he
    laid on last year's <em>Ritmo Tropical</em>
    EP.</p><p>
    Though he's got a deep sample library, programs his rhythm
    tracks, and plays organ, guitar, bass, and sax, Quantic has never been
    quite satisfied with being a one-man band, and he's always employed guests to
    great effect. One of his most rewarding collaborators, Alice Russell, is
    unfortunately absent here, but vocal contributions from Ohmega Watts, the
    Rebirth's Noelle Skaggs, and Candela All Stars' Tempo keep things interesting. Holland has also pulled in Puerto Rican trumpeters Major and Javier Marrero to up the
    Latin ante-- these guys were part of the glory days of Fania records, a catalog
    that seems to provide Quantic with at least a few samples.</p><p>
    The Marreros and Tempo take their turns on ""Sabor"", the album's
    hardest dance track, which hitches Fania horns and Holland's sax playing to
    a funked-up disco beat for a seven-minute workout. Tempo sings in Spanish, and
    his short, economical phrasing becomes almost like another sample in Holland's hands. Skaggs
    sings in a more direct nu-soul style, and Holland
    backs her with roiling Afro-Cuban breaks. Watts
    gets two vocals on the album-- he really gets some air off the crazy bounce of
    ""Blow Your Horn"", on which he obeys the title. ""Ticket to Know Where"" is better, though, with an Afrobeat-inflected
    backing for Watts' street violence lament, a balance of simply counting down
    the horrors of ghetto life (""puddles of blood,"" for instance) and offering
    solutions to ""break the chain,"" including better education.
    </p>
<p>
    The vocal tracks are balanced by five instrumentals that range from okay to great. ""Tell It Like You Mean it"" closes the album by
    layering funky sawtooth waves, a killer beat, and gentle sax intrusions into a
    strangely emotional mix. ""Bomb in a Trumpet Factory"" earns it title, sounding
    like an old Raymond Scott romp filtered through the afterfuture. The others
    suffer from being a little too static, though, and while that doesn't make them
    unpleasant, they don't positively contribute to the album.
    </p>
<p>
    In spite of a little filler, <em>An Announcement to Answer</em> comes on strong when it counts and winds
    up being a satisfying listen. Most importantly, the record's complex, earthy
    sound stays with you, meaning that beyond their immediacy, the songs have
    emotional depth. Quantic's total approach to music makes his combinations
    organic and his records a funky good time.

    us slack-jawed, mouth-breathin' Yanks. We like our innings three outs
    long, our pies made with apple, and our indie rock easily categorized
    into readymade labels like ""post-punk"" or ""freak-folk."" However, in the
    same manner Almodóvar can mash up comedy, drama, romance, and magic
    realism into a feasible feature film, German pop group Klee acts like
    they've never seen the genre dividers on a Tower Records CD rack. While
    practically any throwaway tag fits the group, the trio's first
    stateside release stands for, above anything else, effete pop, no
    matter what accessorized genre it's grafted on.</p><p>
    That's not to say <em>Honeysuckle</em>'s a triumph in genre-bending. Far
    from it. Instead, the band parlays Suzie Kerstgens' versatile
    voice into an album varied enough to draw attention away from otherwise
    humdrum craftsmanship. Kerstgens, an Annie/Amy Millan/Gustav hybrid,
    hedges her mostly guttural German lyrics with a breathy delivery,
    allowing her to toy with emo, twee, shoegaze, and electro-pop
    interchangeably. Providing a fluid backdrop, the rest of the band shows
    off their cosmopolitan tastes with hints of the Cure, New Order, Stars,
    and My Bloody Valentine, albeit backhandedly.</p><p>
    On a cynical level, <em>Honeysuckle</em> seems to serve merely as a
    vehicle for uber-hip dance single ""Gold"". The song appears twice on the
    tracklist, both in English and German versions, and it's the album's only true
    new wave cut among a throng of sleepy-eyed, atmospheric pop numbers. Of course, when the song's prickly reverb riffs
    out-muscle the rest of the album's guitar parts combined, the
    favoritism makes sense. Too much of <em>Honeysuckle</em> lollygags
    through bucolic scenery reminiscent of today's post-Britpop guitar bands.
    While songs like ""Two Questions"" and ""With You"" contain enough
    provocative ideas to gather no moss, the album opens and closes with a
    spattering of shapeless dream pop, bloated to the gills with jangly
    guitar and plastic strings.</p><p>
    Perhaps the best solution to Klee's eco-heavy sound lies in the urban
    sprawl of <em>Honeysuckle</em>'s few electronic numbers. ""Two Questions"" and ""As
    Long As You Live"" sport compact electro hooks while not sounding
    entirely unctuous to slapdash dance-rock. ""Not
    Even Ten Horses"" veers into Pixies territory with its melodic,
    charged-up bassline and ""Gigantic"" sing-song vocals. For all the praise

    The repetition of the word ""weird"" is no coincidence. Weird Weeds' blend of experimental structures and traditional pop is, after all, a confounding thing. There are scarcely any verse-chorus-verse progressions to speak of on <em>Weird Feelings</em>. Instead, the Austin, Texas-based trio composes non-linear pieces of music that range from hushed atmospheres to spastic explosions. And while these songs are unpredictable, they never sound haphazard or improvised; instead, the band plays and composes with high regard for subtlety. But, as is often the case with the experimental end of indie rock, these songs can be too slippery to grasp.</p><p>
    On the title track, for example, a sparse rhythm ushers in syncopated bass thuds and hi-hat spills. From there, a scraping, bowed guitar tone stretches out over the punctuated beat. The song continues to build tension with the addition of clanging, trebly chime sounds. Finally, a wobbly chorus, which includes Rory Seydel and Caila Thompson-Hannant of Shapes and Sizes, sings ""You feel so alive"" twice and-- poof-- it's over. Given its title, ""Weird Feelings"", and its succinct lyric, the song seems to function as some kind of study in moods. It's a piece of music that is as understated and tonal as a Rothko canvas. In other words, it's evocative and engaging if you give it your full attention, but fades into the background if you're the slightest bit distracted.</p><p>
    The instrumental ""Nose to the Wind"" is more energetic and, throughout its duration, seems poised to take off. The sustained guitar tone of ""Weird Feelings"" resurfaces here in a more abrasive mode, as if the instrument's strings are being raked by a blunt object, Lee Ranaldo-style. A second guitar provides a foil in the form of a sprightly, nimble picking pattern and revs up to a sturdier strum before Nick Hennies clobbers his drum hit in a controlled burst of noise that conjures Deerhoof's orchestrated eruptions. (In fact, guitarist Aaron Russell has played with Deerhoof's Greg Saunier in THETEETHE.) But like ""Weird Feelings"", ""Nose to the Wind"" simply recedes into another quiet passage, content to ebb and flow but do little more.
    </p>
<p>
    When Weird Weeds delve into more straightforward, linear songwriting, as on the methodically paced ""Tupper"" or the light-hearted ""Broken Arm"", the band tends to forego its experimental impulses entirely, rather than integrating them to create a more fully realized whole. ""Alley"", on the contrary, manages to marry the two halves, abruptly moving from acoustic strums and slow motion cymbal crashes to chirping sounds and odd percussion to divide vocal sections.
    </p>
<p>
    On<em> Weird Feelings</em>, Weird Weeds excel at creating moods and demolishing formulaic songwriting. In spite of a few unexpected fits of volume, the album quietly demands patient listening to follow all of its structural tweaks. But, in the end, the payoff for listeners' investment is a host of cool sounds and not a collection of compelling songs.

Criticism is dangerous. Don't try this at home, kids.</p><p>
    Ironically, Herren was taking violent issue with a largely positive review, albeit one in which my praise had been obscured by what, in retrospect, was an ill-conceived joke about cultural sensitivity.  My main thesis, unclouded by the jest, was that Savath &amp; Savalas' mini-album finale, <em>Mañana</em>, had outperformed the project's previous output because it started to tweak rather than reverently reproduce the Catalan folk music at its heart.  Admirable as Herren's efforts to explore the music and culture of half his genetic background were, these excavations only truly took flight when he incorporated the rest of his heritage, up to and including his recent history as hyphenated-loop-splicer extraordinaire.</p><p>
    Thankfully, A Cloud Mireya picks up somewhat from where that previous pseudonym left off, retaining that project's ethereal, soothing atmosphere.  This time around, Herren trades in Eva Puyuelo Muns for Claudia Deheza, formerly of the excitably named On!Air!Library!, to fill the role of muse/singer/collaborator.  Despite being detached from her twin sister Alley, Deheza still contributes characteristically strange but plush vocals, helped by Herren's manipulations and occasional low-part harmonization.
    </p><p>
    Musically, Herren contributes a fascinating mélange of his international influences without tipping the balance toward any one locality or ignoring the technology of his work as Prefuse 73. Songs like ""These Nights"", with its mellow psychedelia simmering over a loosely funky drum kit, or ""Illustional"", which travels from skittery bossa nova to a vaguely Middle Eastern conclusion, reveal a more successful hybrid of Herren's myriad influences.  It's enough to sustain songs much longer than the typical ADD Herren runtime, most notably the sprawling, 12-minute suite ""Bliss Inseclusion"", which repels boredom by evolving through several different phases of Savath-ish fingerpicking, post-rock crecendos, and backward-loop mayhem.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, this kind of music always runs the risk of altitude sickness, chilling out to the point of hypothermia.  ""Another Day"" and ""These Flowers"" run afoul of this fine line, mostly due to Herren's decision to eschew the use of his signature itchy percussion; without his unpredictable ear for rhythm as a tether, Deheza's airy singing floats off all too easily.  Those highly processed vocals, when coupled with relatively straight backing, also occasionally wander into dangerous Enya/Sade territory, as on ""Safety in Number One"".
    </p>
<p>
    But to the duo's credit, these new-age moments are rare relative to placid but intricately detailed compositions like ""Winter Sleep"".  Exotic without being curatorial, sparse without being simple, <em>Singular</em> suggests that A Cloud Mireya may be the first of Herren's personae to give the Prefuse 73 work serious competition for flagship status...and I'm not just saying that to avoid his hate mail.

    Fovea Hex's <em>Huge</em> EP is the latest installment in their <em>Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent </em>series, an ongoing trilogy that has served as a captivating introduction to this self-described ""labyrinthine ensemble of associates."" As with their recent debut <em>Bloom </em>EP,<em> </em>this second edition has once again united an impressive roster of collaborators-- including Brian Eno, film composer Carter Burwell, and the Hafler Trio's Andrew McKenzie-- around the talents of former Mellow Candle singer-songwriter Clodagh Simonds. And despite Fovea Hex's rotating cast of supporting players, it is evident on <em>Huge</em>'s three tracks that the experimental collective is truly starting to get their legs beneath them, as their assembled voices can sound as closely attuned as a single shivered bowstring.</p><p>
    Prior to the late 2005 release of <em>Bloom</em>, Simonds' recording career had been largely dormant for the better part of the past two decades. Since her reemergence, she has gone on to collaborate with acts like Current 93 and Matmos in addition to her work with Fovea Hex. Perhaps as a result of all this sudden activity, her vocals on <em>Huge</em> have taken on an additional glint of confidence, and her cloudless voice now drives these tracks with increasing authority. Her unique, asymmetric songs are written with an obvious self-assurance as well, as Simonds bypasses traditional song structures to instead interlace her gossamer-thin melodic and lyrical strands until they're sturdy enough to withstand nearly any degree of electroacoustic reconstruction.</p><p>
<em>Bloom</em> was largely assembled and mixed by Andrew McKenzie; this time many of those duties were done by Colin Potter (Current 93, Nurse With Wound), whose deft touch is most evident on the instrumental ""A Song For Magda"". Woven from assorted fragments of layered voices, psaltery, and Potter's electronic ""shifting and sieving,"" this drone track's striking subaquatic bass gives it a vivid depth of field and provides an atmospheric interlude between the collection's two lyrical meditations, ""Huge (The Joy of Trouble)"" and ""While You're Away""-- both of which seem borne from the same hypnagogic state between sleep and waking. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Night returns dissolving all/ And leaving me no face at all,"" sings Simonds on ""Huge (The Joy of Trouble)"", her tranquil words overshadowed by nameless dread or, as she puts it, ""Some sense of a missing thing...the light of ill-ease."" This vague sense of anxiety is mirrored in the song's arrangement of Eno's evocative keyboards, Hugh O'Neill's shimmering trumpet, and Simonds' various sound effects listed as ""recycled glass and waltz bed."" But on finale ""While You're Away"" Simonds takes a more comforting view of the transition to nightfall. ""Between the mystery and the fact arrives the sweetest sliver of the day,"" she proclaims, her voice joined by the ethereal harmonies of Laura Sheeran and Sarah McQuaid. Before its closing, the piece is turned over to Cora Venus Lunny's delicate string arrangement and Burwell's ghostly piano, while field recordings of songbirds call out across the ever-dimming meadows. 
    </p>
<p>
    For Simonds and the far-flung members of Fovea Hex, <em>Huge</em> is another impressive achievement, particularly when considered as a continuation of the music on <em>Bloom</em>. With a running time of just under 20 minutes, however, it's hard to know exactly why the group have chosen to release this cohesive, unified work in such piecemeal fashion. Perhaps it is simply that their collective enthusiasm for this project is such that they wish to deliver their freshly created music to their listeners as quickly as possible no matter the portion size, and if this is the case one can hardly blame them for their zeal.

    Priestess. The band’s take on fast-growl stoner-boogie never gets beyond 1978, and everything about <em>Hello Master</em>, its
    debut album, screams pastiche. When so many metal bands are pursuing
    weird new avenues and hunches or taking their elemental blastbeat roars
    way beyond logical extremes, it’s vaguely disheartening to see a band
    so tied to old-school formalism getting that RCA money. But not too
    many metal bands write hooks the way Priestess do. The first time you
    hear one of these things, it’s glorious; the band’s pedestrian 7-11
    parking-lot choogle all of a sudden soaring up and out into triumphant
    euphoria. When that’s happening, little things like originality don’t
    matter much.</p><p>
    Still, it couldn’t possibly be any easier to play spot-the-influence here; everything on <em>Hello Master</em>
    can be traced directly from Black Sabbath or Ted Nugent or Motörhead,
    and all those bands pulled off the same tricks better most of the time.
    And when the band doesn’t manage to pull off one of those big choruses,
    as on “Living Like a Dog”, the results are just oppressively shitty and
    uninspired pieces of snort-stomp riffage. Also, the choruses wouldn’t
    sound so great if the band’s verses weren’t so consistently
    workmanlike and inconsequential, Mikey Heppner’s strained howl gurgling
    frantically while the guitars chug away underneath him, everyone just
    gathering their energy for the big moment that’s about to come.</p><p>
    But I can’t argue with a song like “Talk to Her”, a thunderous,
    elemental blast of old-school rock escapism; it earns every grunt and
    howl. “Time Will Cut You Down” is another amazing achievement, a power
    ballad that doesn’t sacrifice one iota of force or grandeur when it
    slows the tempo down and gives the chorus a little more room to
    breathe. They make this stuff sound easy.</p><p>
    Comparing Priestess to fellow stoner-metal revivalists the Sword,
    though, a couple of things become immediately apparent. First,
    Priestess are a lot more terrestrial than many of their peers. Their
    lyrics tend to be about girls, not dragons. That anchors their songs in
    real-world angst, but it doesn’t offer the same ridiculous lift. Also,
    the band tends to play a lot faster, keeping their guitars stuck on ""bar-rock."" The Sword’s <em>Age of Winters</em> remains
    one of the most viscerally satisfying albums of the year in large part
    because the band knows how to play slow enough to give their riffs a
    serious punch. If Priestess learned to follow suit, they might have
    more to offer than their ridiculously great chorus hooks. But then, a
    ridiculously great chorus hook is usually enough.<br/></p></div>"|9264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9264-hello-master/|7.3|Tom Breihan

    It’s almost too easy to call Leeds foursome Forward, Russia! the New Kids on the Bloc Party: From the slashing one-note guitar lines, ceaseless rhythmic momentum, panicked vocal
    delivery, and the Soviet signifiers in both bands’ names, they dare
    you not to compare. But Forward, Russia! take their glasnost-algia even further,
    assigning their songs numbers instead of titles to represent the order in which
    they were written. It’s a tactic
    that seems to echo communism’s sublimation of the individual in favour of institutions,
    and the emphasis on process over product, because actual titles are clearly a bourgeois construct.</p><p>
    The numbers game should also shed
    some light on the band’s evolutionary arc, but the songs on <em>Give Me a Wall </em>(aka
    songs “Seven” through “Nineteen”, minus numbers “Eight"", “Ten”, and “Fourteen”)
    are so unvaryingly anxious, that even when you sequence the album numerically in
    your iTunes, it’s difficult to make any definitive conclusions about Forward
    Russia!’s creative trajectory. “Seven” is plaintive Orange Juicey scrap-pop; “Eleven”
    introduces pile-driving riffage and quiet proggy passages that betray an
    affinity for the At the Drive-In/Refused school of post-hardcore; “Fifteen” is an
    inexplicably successful marriage between nu-metal aggression and new-romantic balladry
    that’s so dramatic, the band need to break it up into two parts. But with “Seventeen”,
    Forward Russia! revert to writing pogo anthems for campus communist-party
    student mixers, while on “Eighteen” they go reggae and on “Nineteen” they go “Heart
    of Glass”, because all new-wave-indebted bands have to, eventually.</p><p>
    This random survey may suggest
    a lack of focus, but Forward Russia! deploy all of their slight stylistic shifts
    within a very rigid and very familiar post-punk schematic: by the end of <em>Give
    Me a Wall</em>, you’ll want to strip the lug nuts off of drummer Katie Nicholls’
    hi-hat, simply to force her out of 4/4 time. And though frontman Tom Woodhead possesses
    an impressive, full-bodied bellow-- not so much Robert Smith by way of Kele
    Okerke as a young Julian Cope by way of the Wilderness’ James Johnson-- it too
    becomes exhausting through overuse. But Woodhead's ability to hit the high notes with ease
    and finesse (as on the soaring choruses on “Nine” and “Fifteen”) suggests that
    he’s selling himself short with the standard staccato-shriek shtick. <em>Give Me a
    Wall</em> gives many clues but few definitive answers about where Forward Russia!
    are heading-- but the important thing for now is that they keep on moving.

It divides outside from inside, light from heat, and watcher from watched, rendering objects beyond with picture-frame distinctness: the sun, the moon, the ballerina who lives across the courtyard. A world viewed only through a window, like a life lived only on cinema screens, may offer the illusion of clarity-- particularly comforting in an era parted between people too aware of their own fallibility and those convinced they can do no wrong-- and yet, as James Stewart's character learns in <em>Rear Window</em>, sometimes the illusion is real indeed.</p><p>
    On debut album <em>Through the Windowpane</em>-- which follows this year's mini-LP <em>From the Cliffs</em>-- London-based quartet Guillemots burst from the conventional pop frame with grand gestures, bold strokes, and bright colors, founding their songs upon both Nick Drake's elemental absolutes and the new psychedelia's omnivorous expansiveness. ""Sometimes I could cry for miles,"" singer/keyboardist Fyfe Dangerfield warbles over dystopian piano on ""Sao Paolo"", a 12-minute genre-hopping victory lap that closes the album. If, in Guillemots' world, emotion is measured in distance, surely it's on a massive scale. <em>Through the Windowpane</em> is at times a last-dance hallelujah, at other times an open wound, but it's never meager, and hardly ever mundane.</p><p>
    Such overwhelming nimiety is best administered in small doses, at least at first. In 2005 and 2006, the release of Guillemots' full-length was preceded by three EPs (one online-only) and three singles, each representing the band's ecstatic side. With a ""You Can't Hurry Love"" rhythm and carnival brass, ""Trains to Brazil"" discovers Dexy's pop ebullience in an accidental police killing, celebrating life even as the lyrics of ""prophets and their bombs"" (and trains!) draw an apparently coincidental tragic parallel to last year's London bombings and the sober reality of life during wartime. The whirring percussion of ""We're Here"" again invokes rail travel, though the words may point more toward <em>Aladdin</em>: ""The world is our carpet now,"" exults Dangerfield, leaping to keep up with strings that match the giddy new-love joy of a truly successful ""second dinner date.""
    </p><p>
    Dangerfield's voice is strange and beautiful, enlivening the tender (if exhausting) assuredness of Jeff Buckley with a few sublimely bizarre tics. On Guillemots' third and arguably best single, the aggressively chiming ""Made Up Love Song #43"", Dangerfield lavishes the bridge of a near-perfect lovesong (in the self-aware Divine Comedy mode) with gut-pounding avian squawks that blur the line between lover and madman, while a backing choir oohs and ahhs as if Phil Spector were there pistol cocked. ""There's majesty in a burnt-out caravan,"" Dangerfield explains in advance; Guillemots' hugeness is tied inextricably to a fundamental weirdness-- which should shield the band from ill-considered comparisons to the dull bombast of Keane and their ilk. <em>Through the Windowpane</em>'s whirring, windblown title track reverses Dangerfield's limber vocal, then casts it aloft for further wordless invocations.
    </p>
<p>
    Where such fellow maximalists as Go! Team stick to cheerleading and Animal Collective opt for distance, Guillemots extend their vivid, explosions-as-the-costars-kiss style of songwriting even to wussy topics. Opener ""Little Bear"" drapes Dvořák-esque strings over a simple, faltering melody as Dangerfield paints a bittersweet breakup in sky, soil and bracken wood. ""If I had you, all the stars wouldn't fall from the sky/ And the moon wouldn't start to cry/ There'd be no earthquakes,"" he adds unadorned over plinking orchestration on ""Blue Would Still Be Blue"", putting longing into hyperbolic, through-the-window language sure to sicken the unsentimental. ""If the World Ends"" is an incantatory slowdance swooner, ""Redwings"" is where Sondre Lerche meets ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"", and ""A Samba in the Snowy Rain"" is an abstract choral vision evoking Talk Talk's ""New Grass"".
    </p>
<p>
    And yet a window is not merely a transparent frame, but a physical part of the view, too. Guillemots surely know this (they're named after a bird, after all). Even as they cast an eye on their surroundings with unreal clarity-- sun, moon, love, stars-- Guillemots can't help but step into the framed picture, looking out and confronting their own reflections in the dark: jazz, samba, classical, Motown, AM-pop, indie-rock, anthem-rock. On 2001's ""Life in a Glass House"", Thom Yorke sang of a desire to paper over all the panes; Guillemots guitarist MC Lord Magrao once played his guitar facing a set of mirrors that reflected the crowd back to itself. The doors of perception may never be cleansed, but on <em>Through the Windowpane</em>, these four bring the infinite, as much as the binary, a little closer to sight.

    Three albums and one EP deep, Jurassic 5 have now lasted exponentially
    longer than any of the old-school South Bronx pioneers they so
    slavishly imitate. The L.A.-based group, now a quintet after the
    departure of DJ Cut Chemist, has spent the past ten years recreating
    the aesthetic of early rap crews like the Treacherous Three and Crash
    Crew, intricately weaving their voices in and out of each other,
    finishing each other’s lines, and harmonizing their choruses. It works
    like a decade-long experiment, an attempt to take forgotten techniques
    and turn them into 21st-century pop music. There’s nothing wrong with
    this kind of retro formalism, and a group like the Stray Cats had a
    nice early-80s pop run doing the exact same thing with a different set
    of sources. But then, the Stray Cats didn’t write songs about how Def
    Leppard weren’t true to their art form.</p><p>
    When they’re kicking harmless, meaningless call-and-response cliché,
    it’s difficult to hate Jurassic 5; there’s an airy, fluid effortlessness to
    their vocal interplay and a good-natured hamminess to their
    crowd-pleasing pyrotechnics. But they run into trouble when they start
    talking about their brand of retro-cheese as the only true form of
    hip-hop, calling out street-rappers who couldn’t have less to do with
    them. There’s a discomfitingly conservative and reactionary edge to a
    line like “They never end that quest for the house on the hill.” It’s a
    gallingly self-righteous statement from a group with only one rapper
    (Chali 2na) who manages to project anything resembling a personality.
    2na’s commanding, buttery baritone works more often than not but even
    he isn’t above the occasional numbingly bland line (“You live life; the
    next part is you die, too/ And there’s no one on Earth that
    doesn’t apply to”). The other emcees are technically impeccable but
    thoroughly interchangeable.</p><p>
    The group has been consciously distancing itself from contemporary
    versions of rap for so long that its not particularly surprising when
    the only big-name guests on <em>Feedback </em>are the Dave Matthews
    Band. What’s surprising is that “Work It Out”, the DMB collaboration,
    is probably the best song on the album, a slow, sunny, weightless jam
    about how we should all understand each other or whatever with a great
    growl-sung chorus from Matthews. We’re firmly in G. Love territory
    here, but it’s gentle and unassuming enough to work beautifully. The
    album’s other successful songs work pretty much the same way, letting
    the group’s harmonic tag-team style slow down into a contemplative
    mutter; the opener “Back 4 U” is laid-back and disarming enough to
    evoke “Fallin’”, the De La Soul/Teenage Fanclub collaboration from the <em>Judgement Night</em> soundtrack.</p><p>
    But too much of the album either throws the group into truly
    unflattering contexts (the hyperactive Black-Eyed Peas-esque
    for-the-ladies nonsense of “Brown Girl”) or returns them to the
    hamster-wheel formalism they’ve been running into the ground for years
    now. The group continues to complain about how everyone in rap is after
    money, but they still can’t seem to come up with anything nearly as
    emotionally resonant as, say, the Game’s “Like Father, Like Son”. Two
    separate songs find the group in full-on reminisce-mode, and a few
    others find the group talking about being the sound of the future while
    pushing the same throwback pastiches they’ve always done. It would be
    nice to hear a group like this take the time to sit and wonder why the
    rappers on the radio are finding fans when they aren’t rather than just
    bitterly complaining from the sidelines, but I’m not holding my breath.<br/>

    It's hard these days to play traditional music with no modern or ironic
    twist and not be consigned to some marginal concert circuit, with your albums
    filed away from the heavy retail foot traffic. The four men of Chatham County
    Line not only play an extremely faithful brand of traditional country and
    bluegrass, they write their own material in the style as well. While they
    haven't quite come up with the next ""I'll Fly Away"", ""In the
    Pines"", or ""Cash on the Barrelhead"", they've done well over
    three albums capturing the essence of great folk and mountain music.</p><p>
    The band's mostly acoustic approach-- the slightest shades of pedal steel
    and organ from bassist Greg Readling are the only noticeable electrification--
    certainly lends an air of authenticity. The recording on <em>Speed of the
    Whippoorwill</em> has an inclusive, participatory feel, like anyone with a bow
    or a few strings to pluck could jump in any time. You could drag an upright
    bass, banjo, guitar, fiddle, and mandolin to the street corner and play this
    stuff without amplification, just harmonizing for whoever walked past.</p><p>
    Like their last album, <em>Route 23</em>, this one contains two fantastic
    instrumentals that showcase the band's thoughtful interplay and impressive
    fingerwork-- ""Savoy Special"" goes for speed, while ""Brice's
    Crossroads"" is quiet, almost meditative, centered on trembling mandolin
    lines. Main songwriter Dave Wilson has penned a fine set for the band this time
    out, and his voice has the warm nasality needed to get his prison and mining
    narratives off the ground. Chugging numbers like ""Company Blues"" and
    ""Coming Home"" are fun, but the ballads are the album's meat. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Waiting Paradise"" follows a sickly
    child's progression into a soldier at war with an evocative melody, backed by a
    drifting, improvised arrangement. The two-part harmony gets a portion of the
    last verse to itself for one of the album's most arresting moments. A quiet
    organ enlivens ""They Were Just Children"" and its story of a
    father exploiting his sons' talent and ultimately losing them. ""By the
    Riverside"" hits between the two extremes, arriving at a loping two-step
    that gives John Teer some room to move on his fiddle. 
    </p>
    Not
    every song is perfectly written, but the playing generally picks up any slack
    in the compositions. The album ultimately feels like a casual good time had by
    musicians genuinely connected to an era when a lot more people played
    instruments and your neighbors were likely to know all the same songs you did.
    It's never going to be in style, but it'll never sound passé either, and <em>Speed
    of the Whippoorwill</em> is timelessly enjoyable.</div>"|9233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9233-speed-of-the-whippoorwill/|7.1|Joe Tangari

    Despite a great deal of progress over the last few years, the sad truth is
    that the laptop remains a second-class citizen in rock band formats. Sure, more
    bands have come around to the idea of having a laptopist on full display in
    their live performances, but in many instances these folks are the 00s
    equivalent of 90s alt-rock's cellists-- less a stylistic embellishment than a
    way to bring your best pal on tour. Even when the sonic potential of the laptop
    features prominently on a group's records, its contribution to the live mix is
    usually marginal; I remember trying to determine at a Wilco show in 2002
    whether Mike Jorgensen was a band member or the monitor guy sitting unusually
    close.</p><p>
    Perhaps the inability of the laptop to truly infiltrate the rock-instrument
    status quo has to do with very simple, aesthetic reasons; theorize all you
    want, it's just really hard to rock out while pointing and clicking. No
    surprise, then, that a major exception to that rule, the thoroughly spastic
    Jason Forrest, is attempting to rectify this regrettable situation through his
    label, Cock Rock Disco. One of those acts, the Dutchman recording under the
    adverbial alias of About, proves himself valuable to the campaign with his
    debut CD <em>Bongo</em>, using the mulching capabilities of the computer to
    create an intriguingly nervous brand of pop-punk.</p><p>
    About's sound is not unlike what you'd expect to get if Forrest's mish-mash
    ""My 36 Favorite Punk Songs"" started influencing actual bands, filled
    as it is with impossible drumbeats and roller-coaster-jerk tempo shifts.
    However, Rutger Hoedemaekers' compositions aren't nearly as abrasive as those
    of most laptop jockeys, largely conforming to new wave conventions in spite of
    the electronically volatile rhythm section. With his nasally voice,
    Hoedemaekers often sounds like he's pirating the dweeby sound of The dB's
    (never more so than on ""Strike You as the Enemy"") rather than the
    sonic terrorism of Kid606, while including enough technological spice to avoid
    being your cool uncle's weekend nostalgia trip.
    </p>
<p>
    While a handful of songs stick to the ""rock band plus scratched-disc
    drum samples"" format, About's toolbox goes deeper than routine loop
    juggling. The subdued piano chords of ""Nogato"" are gradually
    accompanied by a horn section, gleefully capped off by an unexpected tuba on
    the final verse-- few things in music being as welcome as unexpected tuba.
    ""Think Niles Drink"" and ""Stack of Marshalls"" find
    Hoedemaekers interrupting himself with volleys of vocal samples, while
    ""Band Dynamics"" employs a female singer and raved-up synthesizers in
    a giddy facsimile of Max Tundra's joyous 8-bit pop.
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately,
    the middle section of <em>Bongo</em> gets bogged down in half-sketched
    experiments and instrumental doodles, stumbling over the barrier between
    rhythmically inventive and skittishly obnoxious on ""Boo (Hoo)"" and
    ""Furry Dice"". But the percentage of songs that fall victim to
    over-mechanization is much lower that most artists who attempt this sort of
    hybrid; for the most part, Hoedemaekers effectively uses his cut-up drums to
    take the energy of pop-punk to new levels of sugar-highness rather than letting
    the machines overwhelm the songs. If only more groups could so skillfully
    unleash the hidden rock-out potential of the laptop, perhaps it can someday
    successfully break the oppressive instrument barrier, becoming more than an
    onstage fashion accessory.

    Our Brother the Native's songs are loose and sprawling,
    pieced together with acoustic guitars, sloppy percussion, fragments of field
    recordings, toys raided for circuits to bend, and unison voices that sound at
    home around a campfire. If that sounds familiar, it's because everything about
    them slots with the ramshackle junkyard folk of early Animal Collective, from
    their music style to their name to their album title to their label. There's a
    lot of this sort of thing going around, of course, but Our Brother the Native
    have an additional hook: Two of these guys are just old enough to drive; the
    grizzled vet is just old enough to vote.</p><p>
    Their tender ages adds an initial tinge of interest because
    this sort of music usually comes with certain assumptions. First, you generally
    want bands to learn the rules of songwriting before they start breaking them.
    Second, you expect they've absorbed a wide range of music before deciding to
    work in this narrow vein (see the Nurse With Wound list enclosed with
    their debut). Neither of those things seem possible with Our Brother the
    Native, when you have two 16-year old guys making music in their bedroom in
    Redford, Michigan, and e-mailing parts to an 18-year old in California so that
    he can tinker with them. We have to assume, then, that Our Brother the Native
    liked what they heard from the Paw Tracks catalog and decided to do something
    of their own.</p><p>
    Nothing wrong with that, of course, and in the end all we
    have is an album of songs to contend with. The good and bad of Our Brother the
    Native stick out right away, and further listens do little to smooth these
    extremes. The production, even with the bedroom recordings and e-mailed files,
    is consistently engaging, busy with unnamable noises while leaving enough holes
    to let light through. Of particular interest is the subtle use of voices taped
    from movies, which at their best bring to mind The Books. These recordings give
    an added feeling of dislocation and uneasiness, coming on like a TV humming in
    the background of an institution while residents bang around on instruments
    spread across the floor.
    </p>
<p>
    The vocals, typically a warbling and tuneless falsetto that
    makes Ariel Pink sound like Jeff Buckley, are the album's undoing. You get the
    feeling that the songs rendered thus are supposed to sound
    ""disturbed"" and ""creepy"" but the effect is just the
    opposite-- an amateurish annoyance robbing the clattering musical background of
    its earned dark vibe. Lyrics are mostly incomprehensible, which is to the good,
    especially when you hear the syrupy love poetry tossed off in ""Tilia
    Petiolaris"", the only song sung in a normal register.
    </p>
<p>
    Teenagers, man, what are you going to do? Still,
    have to give respect where it's due: bad singing and clunky lyrics can be
    fixed, and all things considered this is a very promising debut. I mean,
    ""Welcome To The Arborary"" as-is would sound really good tucked
    somewhere on <em>Here Comes the Indian</em>, and that's something. Our
    Brother the Native have ideas and a feel for atmosphere and I'd love to hear
    what they're doing in five years.

    I always knew there was a secret love lurking deep within the psyche of Death from Above 1979, a love they were afraid to expose to a world that just wouldn't understand. The scarves, the mountain of keyboards that they brought on tour but rarely touched, the remix album; all signs pointed to an inner desire to drop the indie-metal façade, to dispense with the chugging riffs and hyper-macho lyrics. Sure, noisy two-man bass-and-drums acts were what the kids wanted, but Death From Above could only live the lie for so long. They...just...gotta...dance!</p><p>
    OK, maybe those assumptions are only half-right, as thus far only bassist Jesse Keeler has fully given in to the seductive groove of dance, under the guise of his side project MSTRKRFT. Already glimpsed doing the remix thing on DFA79's ""Sexy Results"" and tracks from Wolfmother and Bloc Party, Keeler hinted at a desire to make rock/dance hybrids that would buck the fizzling trend of loose-limbed post-punk in favor of a more classically house-minded approach, albeit with the four-on-the-floor adorned with crunchy guitar rather than blippy synths.</p><p>
    To his credit, Keeler doesn't pander to DFA79 fans wondering where the guitars went: Drum machines provide the rhythms, keyboards color in the rest. Every vocal is slathered in vocoder, and lyrics use dancing to signify fucking and fucking to signify dancing (for entendre at its worst, see ""She's Good for Business""). It's all a bit too directly filtered (no pun intended) through Daft Punk's <em>Discovery</em>, but there are plenty worse albums to emulate for one's side project. 
    </p>
<p>
    In fact, MSTRKRFT so religiously adheres to the disco/house production instruction manual that the album sadly lacks an original twist that could've been scavenged from Keeler's background. Where DFA79's hard-rock singing could have added much-needed edge, the vocoder is instead omnipresent, and while it occasionally adds cybernetic charms to a track like ""Work on You"", the instrument is largely used to cover up lifeless, leering vocal melodies like ""Bodywork"" and ""Easy Love"". The sampled guitar-riff drops that made some of <em>Romance, Bloody Romance</em>'s better remixes studies in electronic vs. rock dynamics are hardly employed on <em>The Looks</em>, even though the sound succeeds in rare moments like the rumbling ""Paris"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Whereas DFA79 got considerable mileage out of the tension of playing dance-based music using the weaponry of hard rock, MSTRKRFT isn't conflicted enough to warrant more than a shrug. Keeler succeeds in meticulously reconstructing the electronic music he clearly has a taste for, but without stirring in any of his own personality the songs do little more than run in place, joylessly hitting the marks without changing the rules in any meaningful or attention-grabbing way. Just as a little repression can make a person's behavior that much more interesting, so too could MSTRKRFT's sound benefit from being a bit less in touch and open with Keeler's formerly-hidden inner desires.

In the self-proclaimed supercorner, you've got blue-fingered false prophets like Cream and twiddly sex-comedy fodder like Asia-- groups ultimately gibbeted on their own dead seriousness, man. More common, however, are all-star bands like the Traveling Wilburys, which take a friendly, beer-oriented approach antithetical to any presumptions of superness.</p><p>
    Predictably, Midwest veterans Golden Smog fall into the latter camp, with casual backyard-barbecue Americana that's either late for the Fourth of July or early for Labor Day. The band originally comprised Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy, Jayhawks co-founders Gary Louris and Marc Perlman, Soul Asylum's Dan Murphy, and sometime Jayhawk accompanist Kraig Johnson (also a member of Run Westy Run, Iffy and the Program). After a 1992 covers EP, the group garnered attention for 1995 country-rock full-length <em>Down by the Old Mainstream</em>, an earthy excursion into nasal twang, soused guitar solos and plains-state heartache. ""She don't have to see you to see through you,"" Tweedy groans on a cover of little-known Texas soul singer Bobby Paterson. 1998's <em>Weird Tales</em> continued the group's alt-country trajectory, to more modest acclaim.</p><p>
    Cool, but that was eight years ago. In the meantime, the Jayhawks broke up, Soul Asylum lost founding bassist Karl Mueller to cancer, and Wilco, well, you read Pitchfork, right? <em>Another Fine Day</em> finds Golden Smog joining the present decade's post-alt-country migration and settling in as deans of loose, sweaty dad-rock, which as ruts go is as cozy as a sofa-cushion ass groove on <em>24</em> night-- not hating! The sound is still loose, but tends toward Badfinger's ""Hey Jude""-styled anthem-pop and the Band's ragged harmonies more than Woody Guthrie folksiness or god-fearing Louvin Brothers Appalachia. Dudes haven't mellowed, exactly, so much as grown a little too comfortable, but <em>Another Fine Day</em> offsets some of what it lacks in freshness with aw heck poker-night camaraderie.
    </p><p>
    Like previous Golden Smog efforts, which can veer from cutesty Tweedy throwaway ""Pecan Pie"" to Johnson slide-guitar mini-epic ""Yesterday Cried"", <em>Another Fine Day</em> is a typically schizophrenic all-star side project. The tuneful title track and sprawling, Guess Who-vamping ""Beautiful Mind"" show flashes of Wilco's recent abstraction, while ""Corvette"" charges into Cheap Trick power-pop shortly after ""5-22-02"" incorporates horns and an <em>Abbey Road</em> guitar solo. Murphy's blues-based ""Hurricane"" is a fiery barroom singalong. Muni Loco, wife of producer Paco Loco, sings on banjo-twinkled ""Cure for This"", which would have fit on the recent Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs '60s covers album. Speaking of covers, Louris and Tweedy tear through an organ-fueled duet on the Kinks' Dave Davies' touching ""Strangers"", one of the album's highlights.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Another Fine Day</em> is not called <em>Another Super Fine Day</em>. In other words, its creators didn't destine it to be an emetic pile of self-important suck. Still, its midtempo classic-rock radio chug tires; its lyrics are occasionally silly, as in ""surprise, surprise, everyone dies,"" from Louris/Tweedy flamenco-tinged Western waltz ""Listen Joe"". However, the relaxed spirit of the album's predecessors remains, even as the sound has grown a little bit more rock'n'roll. Non-supergroup supergroups at least aren't likely collar-poppers, but that doesn't mean they're always perversely super; sometimes strangely fine is enough for family fun. Yes, dads included.

It is, of course, closer to Super Furry Animals or Belle &amp; Sebastian than current faves like Lily Allen, Nelly Furtado, or Girl Talk, but the album evokes a distinctive lull particular to these oppressively hot months. So, as I endure the sun and humidity, I like to think Vapnet is really singing about rabbits and swimming holes and first love.</p><p>
    Language, after all, is relative. These lyrics obviously mean something to the band members, and whether or not I grasp the finer points of these songs is mostly beside the point, because Vapnet speak fluent pop. As someone who often prizes lyrical boldness over musical innovation, I don’t make this claim lightly. Vapnet <span lang=""EN"">conjugate pop’s structural and instrumental elements to create</span> brightly melodic, lushly orchestrated music that doesn’t let its ambitions or its inventiveness get in the way of setting a perfect mood or having a good time.</p><p>
    Songwriter and guitarist Martin Abrahamsson and singer Martin Hanberg formed Vapnet as an offshoot of the group Sibiria. In 2005 they released the EP <em>Ge Dom Våld</em>, which in retrospect didn’t hint at the complexity of arrangements or the texturing of instruments that highlights<em> Jag Vet Hur Man Väntar.</em><strong> </strong>On the full-length, “Ingång” sets the tone with nearly a minute of ambient noise that leads into a wistful ballad titled “Storgatan”, whose melody is picked out on bells and tugged along by a simple drum machine and Anna Modin’s decorous flute. By contrast, the hand-clapping, finger-snapping “Thoméegrand” is more upbeat, although the expressive guitar riff, out-of-nowhere trumpet solo, ominous backing vocals, and Hanberg’s lead maintain the plaintive tone.
    </p><p>
<em>Jag Vet Hur Man Väntar</em> moves back and forth between the jaunty pop of “Rådhusgatan”, the marching pace of “Brunflovägen”, and the absolutely killer coda of “Färjemansleden”, sung by Modin. As varied as the album is, no song deviates from the album’s dreamy tone, although each one seems to expand and complicate the mood. With its piped-in applause suggesting a live experience, the instrumental “E 14” shape-shifts mercurially and false-stops repeatedly, fully revealing the band’s range. Vapnet layer indie keyboards over Abrahamsson’s distinctive guitarwork and horn fanfares, anchoring everything to real and programmed drums churning out clever disco rhythms. On “Stuguvagen” an amiably shambling verse swells into a gently arching chorus as Hanberg hits the high notes and Abrahamsson’s guitar shuffles off into the sunset. 
    </p>
<p>
    These songs confidently strike a delicate balance: they’re poppy without being twee, moody without being dark, pensive without being precious. Still, I can’t deny that I’ve been tempted to look into translating these lyrics, to find out what these songs <em>really</em> mean. But after spending a few evenings on my back porch drinking Shiners, watching fireflies, and listening to <em>Jag Vet Hur Man Väntar</em>, I’ve come to the conclusion-- a minor breakthrough for me-- that I don’t really need to know what these songs are about. I understand them enough to enjoy them as they sound.

    Over the past few years, several of Finland's various interrelated underground acts-- Kemialliset Ystävät, ES, Kuupuu, the Anaksimandros-- have engaged in what seems an unspoken competition to see who could craft the wildest and most singularly damaged psychedelic utterance. And though the contest is hardly yet settled, it appears that scene linchpins Avarus have once again brought out the heavy lumber. On their latest release <em>Vesikansi</em>, the avant-rock collective attain new peaks/depths of crude free-form bewilderment, plunging the listener into a sonic wilderness so dense and impenetrable that one must fight the urge to begin foraging for food and building a treehouse.</p><p>
    It's the second Avarus album to be released by Secret Eye in conjunction with the group's own Lal Lal Lal imprint, following 2005's <span class=""italic""><em>Jattilaisrotta</em>. </span>Last year, the San Francisco-based tUMUlt label also released <em>Ruskeatimantti, </em>a generous 2xCD set that collected material from several of Avarus' earlier self-released recordings. And while <em>Vesikansi </em>is no match for that collection in terms of bulk or general diversified clamor, it does showcase Avarus working with a heightened degree of focus and communal potency. The album was recorded live in 2005 at the Lazybird Club in Dublin, although it should be noted that Avarus' lo-fi improvisations can make the distinction between studio vs. live recording seem somewhat moot.</p><p>
    As with most of their loose-knit Finnish compatriots, Avarus' lineup is in a regular state of flux, with most of their work roughly organized around the dexterous noisemaking talents of Roope Eronen and Arttu Partinen. Guest vocalist Tara Burke (aka Fursaxa) joins on two extended tracks here, but her contributions-- along with the rest of the group's individual voices--are typically submerged within the wider currents of Avarus' continual hive activity. 
    </p>
<p>
    Avarus have previously been proclaimed to be Finland's most ""regressive"" musical export, and judging from the evidence on <em>Vesikansi</em> it's hard to disagree. The color-saturated electronic wails of the opening ""Lapsivesi"" sound like they could be the amplified love cries of the walrus that peer out from the album's cover. Though it lacks the percussion of some of Avarus' earlier tribal jams, the piece does manage to pick up a faint, ghostly pulse along the way and patiently builds to some sort of near-invisible waveformed climax. Somehow the group are able to pick up this slender thread again on the tumultuous ""Loylyvesi"", a track that pieces together slurred vocal effects, growling tape machines and the occasional recognizable snatch of guitar or keyboard in a manner that resembles Excepter at their most lost and drugged. 
    </p>
<p>
    Although Avarus do occasionally incorporate acoustic instruments into their cyclonic din, their work on <em>Vesikansi</em> is wholly divorced from anything that even remotely approaches folk. This fact is brought home vigorously on the two-part, Burke-aided closer ""Vissyvesi,"" a boundless epic that bears close ancestry to the howling, full-scale noise manipulations of the Dead C or American contemporaries like Double Leopards. Occasionally Avarus take a detour from the ongoing maelstrom to indulge in a brief mantric campfire rhythm or goofy synth interjection, but then it's quickly back into the fray with little concern for continuity or structure. Instead, Avarus seem to take an almost child-like interest in the imaginative possibilities of pure sound, creating on <em>Vesikansi </em>another immersive Finnish environment of endless surprise and discovery.

    Rob Tubb?) in a light blue vinyl jacket with the familiar Daft Punk robot
    helmet pasted over his head. It's a bold move, putting Daft Punk in listeners'
    minds before they've heard a note of your album, especially when you're making
    surging dancefloor electro with anthemic pretensions. Can anyone's music really
    cash that check?</p><p>
    The third Cursor Miner full-length is indeed his most
    dance-oriented release yet, foregoing the new wave pop prominently featured on
    earlier records. While we no longer hear his voice, which reminded me of Beck
    imitating Gary Numan, there's a pop holdover in Cursor Miner's heavy slant
    toward riffs. In fact, a few of these tracks are nothing but riffs-- pretty
    good ones, too-- that are presented, tweaked, amplified, twisted, and then laid
    to rest after five or six or eight danceable minutes. But there's not much Daft
    Punk happening here-- no glittering surface or soft edges or unexpected
    emotions. Cursor Miner serves his electro cold, and the 10 new tracks here
    find him working that particular mojo in myriad ways.</p><p>
    When his hooks are on, as with ""Hair of the Dog"",
    you want him to keep kneading the acid centerpiece like taffy, as he finds
    another funky shape around every corner. Almost as good is the title track's
    ripping and heavily soiled synth lead. ""Exult"" is less blocky than
    the bulk of the album, as it opts for a smooth, shimmery take on a New Order
    build; some vocals would be just right here, but it's still enjoyable.
    ""Open the Box"" makes creative use of an extended sample from ""Six
    Feet Under"", wrapping a Nathanial Senior monolog in an Orbish bath of
    disquieting reverb.
    </p><p>
    The hook-centric focus is reinforced by a cover of Van
    Halen's ""Ain't Talkin' Bout Love"", another gutsy turn considering
    that Jason Forrest introduced it to the fist-pumping sampledelica canon at the
    tail end of ""Ten Amazing Years"". Cursor Miner's version is oddly
    restrained, like you're listening to it while immersed in a swimming pool as the
    band plays up on deck. An opportunity to go way over the top, sadly, is missed. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Cursor Miner Feels Good"" uses the same formula as
    ""Hair of the Dog"" with less inspiring original parts, and grows
    tedious. And that's the issue with the record as a whole: Too many of these
    tracks sound like something to be dropped into a DJ set for a minute or so to
    give a specific transition effect, and they wear out their welcome at pop song
    length (or longer). <br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>Danceflaw</em> closes with a 20-minute megamix that puts
    some of Cursor Miner's better ideas from this and earlier records into a
    suitably ADD context. It's a solid overview that shows how many fun little bits
    he's managed. And it also reinforces the notion that Curor Miner is more adept
    at idea generation than follow-through.

Brent correctly pegged Brighton, England's the Pipettes as leading lights in a new wave of Brill Building-inspired indie pop but guessed that the seven-piece band-- three female singers along with four shadowy male musicians known as ""the Cassettes""-- would be ""unlikely to match"" early single ""I Like a Boy in Uniform (School Uniform)"".</p><p>
    Happily, Brent was mistaken, as three subsequent singles, ""Dirty Mind"", ""Your Kisses Are Wasted on Me"", and ""Pull Shapes""-- each an improvement on its predecessor-- have demonstrated. All three recent A-sides, plus a handful of other previously released tracks, now provide the bulk of debut album <em>We Are the Pipettes</em>. The album therefore doesn't maintain the band's forward momentum for those of us who have been collecting 45s and mp3s for the past year, but it's a giddy encapsulation of the best from a group enchantingly embracing both longstanding pop roots and a contemporary musical culture characterized by collisions between past and present and/or by seemingly incompatible musical styles.</p><p>
    On <em>We Are the Pipettes</em> the band's synchronized winks and nods and finger waggles to patriarchal 60s girl-group music are not so much retro as they are post-retro, the product of an age in which progression in pop music has all but been replaced by cultivation and fusion. The Pipettes' carefully constructed look-- polka-dot dresses, choreographed dances-- and promise to reclaim music from its post-Beatles devotion to ideas of authorship, technique, and ""worthiness"" are meant to frame them as out-of-step throwbacks, but thankfully their album instead recalls the lo-fi wall of sound and communal spirit of fellow indie block party bands the Go! Team, I'm From Barcelona, and U.S.E. That distinction makes the difference between karaoke and creating something that sounds unabashedly Now, as all great pop should. </p><p>
    The twist is meant to be that these three are sexually aggressive, have read their French feminism, own some riot grrrl records, and have distinct, unique personalities in a sort of Spice Girls way (you could call them Desperate Housewife Pipette, Sexy Librarian Pipette, and Mod Pipette). And while these three shrug off suitors, prefer one-night stands, and love a dirty mind, that's hardly a distinctive quality: Smart, sassy girls asserting their individuality and sexuality have been Page One of the female-voiced chart pop playbook for years.</p><p>
    No, the twist isn't that these are girl-group songs as performed by post-ERA females-- it's that they're girl-group songs as performed by three singers who are, well, no longer girls. If Brent and others are lamenting that <em>We Are the Pipettes</em> doesn't contain the outstanding single ""I Like a Boy In Uniform (School Uniform)"", a reason for its exclusion could potentially be found in its parenthetical title-- it's meant to be voiced by teenagers. <em>We Are the Pipettes</em> contains a few references to schooldays-- the central metaphor of ""ABC"", in which the girls feel cockblocked by book learning; the backstory to the cautionary bad-girl tale ""Judy"" (tellingly, two of the oldest songs here). But the bulk of the record is clearly about and by carefree young adults-- away from their parents' disapproving eyes, experienced enough in both love and loss that neither cuts as deeply as it once did, and enjoying feeling young and alive and free.</p><p>
    And while the consequences and theatricality of girl-group songs are, therefore, toned down here, so too is the music. While <em>We Are the Pipettes</em> often swells and soars, thanks to production from Gareth Parton (the Go! Team, Futureheads), it doesn't come near the symphonic grandeur of the best of 60s girl pop. At its best, however, these pocket-sized songs still burst with verve and vitality, mixing heart-pumping melodies with carefree, almost conversational vocals. Along with the previously issued A-sides, former flip ""Because It's Not Love (But It's a Feeling)"" and new tracks ""Sex"", ""Why Did You Stay?"", and the disarmingly tender and direct closer ""I Love You"" ensure that the group steers clear of the cul de sac of revivalism.</p><p>
    In the end, <em>We Are the Pipettes</em> is a modern indie pop album, and a classic one at that. Like the initial twee and p!o!p! kid movements, it embraces an unhip element of the past, understands that indie pop-- even in its tiny, homemade guise-- is a mix of escapist fantasy and big gestures doubling as private conversations, and is unabashedly girly. It's a welcome reclamation of indie pop as the work of bright kids with more ideas than money at a time when the genre's reigning kings, Belle and Sebastian and the Decemberists, are embracing theater-sized, 1970s-aping rock.</p><p>
    That the Pipettes are doing Shangri-La's impersonations on stage is almost a moot point. The necessity and charm of the Pipettes could have just as easily manifested itself had they framed their approach around replicating any other dormant indie pop totem. (Voxtrot, the Clientele, and Camera Obscura already have, respectively, shambolic jangle-pop, reverb-soaked expressionism, and Northern Soul down; the world now needs 21st century versions of yé-yé girl music and Field Mice-like acoustic pop.) Ideally, in this case the group won't get lost in the slipstream between being too pop for indie fans and too indie for pop fans, because there's a lot here for both camps to love.<br/></p></div>"|9244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9244-we-are-the-pipettes/|8.4|Scott Plagenhoef

While Blood Brothers hole up in the studio, recording the follow-up to 2004's <em>Crimes</em> with Fugazi's Guy Picciotto, they offer the <em>Love Rhymes With Hideous Car Wreck</em> EP to tide their audience over until the new album is delivered. Of course the EP's namesake, maybe the most Fugazi-like of the songs from <em>Crimes</em>, opens the EP in unmolested form. Should the fans assume this is the direction the band is headed in?</p><p>
    While it's reminiscent of Picciotto's own projects, the winding
    single-string guitar lines, start-stop rhythms, and abstract lyrics  (alternately muttered and
    wailed by singers Johnny Whitney and Jordan Blilie) are perfectly
    representative of the Blood Brothers' current <em>modus operandi</em>. But its inclusion on an EP with six other rare tracks (plus a video for the title track, played in its own special tiny-ass window) is a formality, a justification for the release of a grag bag of other material.</p><p>
    So what are the goodies here? Two decent B-sides from a UK single, two lukewarm unnecessary remixes, a Blood Brothers remix of an entirely different band, and a live version of-- you guessed it-- ""Love Rhymes With Hideous Car Wreck"". New B-side ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" is much like ""Love Rhymes..."" though it leans more on the band's metal side, building a quiet/loud dynamic that's as effective, if not quite as surprising or stunning, as the title track. ""Metronomes"" is far more divergent, a moody gothic trudge led by Whitney as he drags the rest of the band behind him by one heavy chain.  Its sterile sound-- devoid of any seizure-like spazz-outs-- is just as ominous as their older, more abrasive material.
    </p><p>
    The remixes are extraneous. ""Crimes"" gets stripped down and gets a little more swing with some open space, and ""Peacock Skeleton With Crooked Feathers"" gets a guy pretending to rap over the beginning. The band's remix of Gang of Four's ""Anthrax"" is less embarrassing than many that appeared on <em>Return the Gift</em>, but their hopped-up drumline version barely merits inclusion here. And while I won't dispute that the band is great live, the only difference between the live version of ""Love Rhymes..."" and the recorded version is the applause at the beginning and end. 
    </p>
<p>
    This in-between-albums EP is a missed opportunity, one that could have offered a peek at new material or just a peek at <em>something</em>, any unexpected detour outside the band's usual oeuvre. Instead, we're forced to second-guess the band's next step from material that offers no new insights. I called it a holdover, but it's meant to hold over just one group of people: the fans. I can't see this market-clogging EP satiating them.

    Hush Arbors is the work of the enigmatic, Virginia-born Keith Wood, a man
    whose restless travels have led to loose associations with such premier
    underground outfits as Sunburned Hand of the Man, Wooden Wand and the Vanishing
    Voice, and Six Organs of Admittance. On recent recordings each of those
    form-shifting acts can be heard nudging away from more definable acid-folk
    territories, so it seems only reasonable that artists like Wood should be
    standing ready to move in and tend the mystic fires in their absence. Following
    a pair of releases on Digitalis as well as the usual crop of handmade CD-Rs,
    the five-song <em>Landscape of Bone</em> now appears as part of Three Lobed's
    intriguing new <em>Modern Containment</em> series, and it again provides instant
    transport to Hush Arbor's singular lost domain.</p><p>
    The most prominent distinguishing feature of Hush Arbors' music is Wood's
    gentle, slightly dazed falsetto. His fragile vocal delivery-- which here seems
    generated somewhere northward from Neil Young or Pearls Before Swine's Tom Rapp--
    can lend even his most straightforward material a strange, asymmetric wobble.
    This vague discombobulation is further heightened by Hush Arbors' gauzy,
    outstretched fields of phased guitars, hand percussion, and unmoored
    drones-- all recorded with a lo-fi naturalism that recalls the open-aired
    environments of Jewelled Antler Collective acts like Skygreen Leopards or
    Blithe Sons.</p><p>
    True to the album's title, each song on <em>Landscape of Bone</em> works the
    word ""bone"" somewhere into its lyrics-- ""Broken Bones"",
    ""Oar of Bone""-- as Wood dreamily sifts through the tangled knots of
    memory and regret. Despite this mini-album's brevity, he makes use of his
    limited space to consider a full spectrum of emotional terrain. His blurred
    enunciation sometimes makes his words indecipherable, but the opening
    ""Bones of a Thousand Suns"" has a distinct elegiac quality, its
    mournful liturgy framed by deep-earth hums and soft coils of fuzz guitar.
    Adorned with subtle slide guitar work, ""Broken Bones"" could almost pass
    for a particularly fried Townes Van Zandt creation, filled as it is with empty
    whiskey bottles and lost-love despondence (""I've died and I've died and
    I've died some more."") Soon, however, the album's mood reverses on the
    spirited ""Bones By the Sea"" which matches Wood's ecstatic garble to a
    melodic, tradition-steeped Appalachian folk cadence. 
    </p>
<p>
    Wooden Wand himself (aka James Toth) makes a cameo appearance on the
    dazzling ""Nine Bones"", a grainy 10-minute recessional that closes
    this short collection with a heady blast of free-rock drumming and
    barely-harnessed electricity. Like his friend and sometime collaborator Ben
    Chasny-- who last year also contributed liner notes to Hush Arbors' self-titled
    album-- Keith Wood here shows the ability to take the barest ingredients of folk
    and psych-rock traditions and transmute them into his own unique form of
    sorcery. Three Lobed have already announced that future installments of their <em>Modern
    Containment</em> series will feature EPs from the likes of Bardo Pond, MV &amp;
    EE, Mirror/Dash and Sun City Girls, so hopefully this engaging <em>Landscape of
    Bone</em> might also serve as a harbinger of further treats to come.

    To many people, the name ""Don Caballero"" is more or less synonymous with the dubious music sub-genre known as ""math rock."" While the pejorative connotations of the term itself are not necessarily unwarranted, it seems unfair that such an awesome band would be forever tied to such a lame style of music. Sure, Don Caballero make use of looped, minimalistic guitar figures, and irregular time signatures, but every meticulous pattern gets pushed well past its logical conclusion, transformed, sped up, slowed down, broken up, and/or reassembled. A good Don Cab song is every bit as much ""meth-rock"" as it is ""math-rock.""</p><p>
    While drummer Damon Che has always been Don Cab's main attraction, guitar duo Ian Williams and Mike Banfield were a crucial part of the band's signature sound-- best represented by 1998's incredible <em>What Burns Never Returns</em>. Unfortunately, the Don Caballero we all know and love broke up in 2001. Aside from Che, the band responsible for <em>World-Class Listening Problem</em> is entirely Non Caballero, assembled instead from fellow Pittsburgh natives Creta Bourzia. Given that band's metal leanings, and the fact that Relapse is releasing this record, it's not surprising that<em> World-Class Listening Problem</em> is harder and crunchier than its predecessors. Underneath that crunch, however, there isn't really all that much going on.</p><p>
    Which isn't to say that there's a shortage of complicated rhythmic and melodic permutations on <em>World-Class Listening Problem</em>. Structurally, these are definitely Don Caballero songs. The difference, really, comes down to the quality and feel of the album's ongoing shifts and modulations. For lack of a better description, <em>World-Class Listening Problem</em> just doesn't sound as intuitive as its predecessors. Changes come and go, but very little sticks. Even Che's drumming seems less inspired than usual-for whatever reason, <em>World-Class Listening Problem</em> realizes very little of the dramatic potential that comes with a drummer who can play faster and harder than should be humanly possible.</p><p>
    Amidst the relative lack of excitement, there are some pretty cool moments to be found. ""Palm Trees in the Fecking Bahamas"" borders on catchy, but never quite makes it there. Album closer ""I'm Goofballs for Bozzo Jazz"" actually hints at some of the humor in its title, but outstays its welcome as it approaches the four minute mark. Yes, Damon Che is still an awesome drummer, but <em>World-Class Listening Problem</em> does little to emphasize the strength or the energy of his playing.

    The name ""First Nation"" had me thinking of Brightblack Morning Light's Deep Ecology. Song titles like ""Cave Jam"" coupled with the hoof-n-feather cover art also suggest that this Brooklyn trio's on the increasingly popular back-to-nature kick. Regardless of the sylvan daydreaming, Melissa Livaudais, Nina Mehta, and Kate Rosko are more closely aligned with fellow urban bird watchers Animal Collective (their label honchos) and Our Brother Native (accent on ""native"") than those soulfully ambient bread-frying river children. Sure, First Nation might be happy to go weekend backpacking with Brightblack, but their sound isn't nearly as complex or satisfying.</p><p>
    In fact, the chirruping crew stocks its cage with fewer sounds than all aforementioned aesthetic/conceptual compadres. Stepping outside our amber waves of grain, Finnish-folk fracturer Islaja offers a closer textural comparison. Imagine Islaja's trio, Hertta Lussu Ässä, stranded in a rain forest, reciting Trickster Tales as Raincoats-pitched nursery rhymes.</p><p>
    The album has its moments. For instance, ""Awakes"", an intro of sorts, is a slow sunrise, opening the powwow with a forked-tongued vocal slap. First Nation is interesting when undergoing this sort of disembodied transmogrification, approximating the birdhouse at the Bronx Zoo. The next song, ""Creation (Exquisite)"", an off-kilter morning-prayer service built with guitar scrapes and slippery tonal rings, is more of a slightly straight-up, slightly warped neo-folk incantation. The voices don't harmonize seamlessly and that messiness is quite pleasing. Still, like many of the tracks, it lacks a lift-off. Even the best offering, ""Female Trance"", fails to cast a convincing spell via its catchier Gang Gang Dance two-step. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>First Nation</em>'s overall scrawniness can get boring. ""Monkey"" meanders as it howls and sighs over noodles and drums; the plodding, flute-laced ""Cave Jam"" steers listeners into a dead-end rather than some sacred grotto; ""Child's Eyes"", which feels like some deep-woods musical, pushes toward something skyward-- everyone singing/chanting together-- but swerves into meanderville. It ends with a few seconds of a quietly mixed tribal jam, a sort of campfire raga, and I wish these moments were upped and looped into an endless boogie. 
    </p>
<p>
    On the freak-pop side is a pair of hook-less tunes reminiscent of Deerhoof: The high-pitched shouts of ""Omen"" and synthesized junkyard dub of ""Swells"". On the latter, drums build promisingly, but someone loses time and flails. However, I do like the finale's spastic distorto guitar (I imagine it as one of those with a speaker built into it). Actually, this one reminded me most of Melissa Livaudais' other band, Telepathe, a shamefully overlooked Brooklyn quartet anchored by the excellent drummer/percussionist, Busy Gangnes. First Nation's more skeletal and tentative sound isn't anywhere as pleasing as Telepathe's baroque actions. 
    </p>
<p>
    I grew up on a farm in the Pine Barrens and can dig this trendy rural thing because it reminds me of home, but the indie bird watching movement still confounds me. There are plenty of trees in Brooklyn, sure, but First Nation were obviously perched elsewhere when they scribbled the creation tale lyrics that shows up on the back of the CD jacket: ""They traveled across the / grassy plains grass growing / taller and taller. With each / step losing each other they learned / to listen to the birds,"" etc. I donned my headdress and tried to recreate the moment in McCarren Park, but a bar-league softball game kept distracting me.

You know them, and you know they're amazing. What I want to ask is this: Is there any other artist in the world who isn't dead, 25 years past their prime, or bankrupt that has released, re-released, re-mastered, re-issued, re-packaged, re-bundled and re-offended more than Björk? It's ridiculous, it really is. But it's not until you trundle through the pages and pages of her back catalog that you realize just how brazen she's been. Back when people still bought CD singles, she was one of the worst offenders; not content with being a proponent of the standard two-part CD5 set (remember those?), she'd frequently roll out triple-disc releases, and issue them in packaging purposely made to feel incomplete unless you had them all. Then, inevitably, three months later she'd release a Ugandan Maxi-EP of the same single with most (but not all) of those B-sides plus a rare Fluke/Alec Empire/Mark Bell re-edit and it'd be robbery with a smile all over again. It would have been faster just to burn my money.</p>
<p>In this decade, Björk's release schedule has ballooned from excessive to patently opportunistic. Since 2000, she's augmented her usual stream of full-lengths, CD singles, DVD singles, 12"" singles, bobbleheads, pudding spoons, and pogs with (deep breath): the <i>Cambridge</i>, <i>MTV Unplugged</i> and <i>Live at Shepherd's Bush</i> DVDs; the <i>Inside Björk</i> documentary DVD; four separate live CDs spanning <i>Debut</i>, <i>Post</i>, <i>Homogenic</i>, and <i>Vespertine</i>; the <i>Vessel</i>, <i>Later With Jools Holland</i>, and <i>Miniscule</i> DVDs; three additional iterations of her 1999 video omnibus <i>Volumen</i> (<i>Volumen+</i>, <i>Greatest Hits: Volumen 1993-2003</i>, and <i>Volumen II</i>); <i>Livebox</i>, a repackaging of those four aforementioned live CDs with a bonus DVD thrown in for kicks; the <i>Live at Royal Opera House</i> DVD; the 6xCD <i>Family Tree</i> box, which contained a sum total of 90 minutes of rare and unreleased material spread out across five mini 3"" CDs as well as a best-of compilation; a single-disc <i>Greatest Hits</i> compilation with a completely different tracklisting; the <i>Medulla Videos</i> DVD; a <i>Medulla</i> documentary DVD; the <i>Live DVD Archives</i> and <i>Live Television DVD Archives</i> boxes and, probably the <i>piece de resistance</i> and ultimate harbinger of her total and utter lack of quality control, the 20-track <i>Army Of Me: Remixes and Covers</i>, on which Patrick Wolf and 19 musicians you've never heard of offered their unique and highly fast-forwardable interpretations of ""Army of Me"". That's right. One CD with the same song 20 times in a row. (It sold at full price.)</p>
<p>Where to go from there? Surely not into hiatus-- not when there's royalties to be made. Instead we get <i>Surrounded</i>, a 7xCD box containing DualDisc remasters of each Björk full-length. Don't get too excited: The remasters don't extend to the regular CD audio portions of each disc (which are heard here exactly as they are on their original pressings), but rather, to new Dolby 5.1 and DTS Surround Sound mixes. Then, presumably in an effort to further infuriate those who've dropped a small fortune on the <i>Volumen</i>s, Björk's gone and parceled all her videos across the DVD portions of each album as well. What you end up with are seven full-lengths containing CD mixes, 5.1 mixes and videos from each era. And since <i>Vespertine</i> and <i>Medulla</i> have previously been released in 5.1 iterations, not even the surround stuff is entirely new.</p>
<p>One last thing about <i>Surrounded</i> merits mention: It is, of course, packaged beautifully. Like most of Björk's stuff, there's a real fetishization of the physical artifact at play here. That makes sense: If you're going to cash in on variations on a theme, you may as well elevate those variations to the stuff of high art. If the Ramones were the ultimate working-class band, Björk's the ultimate art director's crush. But despite the presentation, do you really need to drop $100 on this? Probably not. And even if you did, you'd kick yourself for it eventually, 'cause she's pretty much guaranteed to come back with another one that's bigger and better in a few years' time anyway. Built in obsolence-- it's not just for hardware anymore. And they wonder why people stopped buying CDs.</p></div>"|9250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9250-surrounded/|5.9|Mark Pytlik

    The future ain't
    what it used to be, so these days the past can seem like a thing of the
    future. To wit: The sophomore LP by Texas-based rock group Midlake opened at
    #14 on the UK indie charts more than a month before gracing its
    sullen native shores. Similarly, Midlake take a step back from the synth-age psychedelia of their solid
    2004 debut <em>Bamnan and Slivercork </em>on follow-up <em>The Trials of Van Occupanther</em>, an encouraging
    but ultimately disappointing contemplation of time's ceaselessness, love's
    promise, and <em>Harvest</em>-era Neil Young.</p><p>
    Speaking of time,
    Midlake waste little at first. Opener ""Roscoe"" keeps getting compared to Fleetwood Mac but actually comes closer to the
    pristine, high-concept chug of the Alan Parsons Project's paranoid 1982 hit
    ""Eye in the Sky"" (in a good way, gang) or the similarly anxious
    space-rock of the late Grandaddy. ""Whenever I was a child, I
    wondered/ What if my name had changed into something more productive like
    Roscoe/ Been born in 1891, waiting with my Aunt Rosaline,"" whispers
    frontman Tim Smith, his phrasing elusive, his grassy tenor warming into
    multi-part harmonies after one of the year's most casually compelling
    pop moments.</p><p>
    Alas, nothing else here comes close: A fuzzy guitar
    solo goes Lindsay Buckingham's way on the legitimately Mac-like ""Head Home""; monotonous single ""Young Bride"" chases
    ramshackle dance beats and skittery violins through a haunted and hookless
    forest; and ""Bandits"" pairs anachronistic wit (""Do you want to
    be overrun by bandits?"") with mild woodwinds, an acoustic intro recalling ""Mother Nature's
    Son"", and gray Coldplay piano. 
    </p>
<p>
    Throughout the
    album, the desperation for meaningful human contact glimpsed in the record's lonesome centerpiece ""Van
    Occupanther"" underpins images of mountaineers, stonecutters, and frozen
    pines. The album's second most affecting track, horn-sprouting
    ""Branches"", further illuminates the protagonist's heartbreak through
    ominous minor sevenths, ""Exit Music (for a Film)"" triad-inversion segues,
    and a canny reference to the Jackson Browne-penned classic ""These Days"".
    ""It's hard for me but I'm trying,"" Smith delicately repeats, his
    voice falling between Young's woozy falsetto and the sinuous
    timbres of Thom Yorke. The second half of the disc, however, drags amid bell-like
    vintage synths, pastoral singer/songwriter strums, and a stolid mountain of
    midtempo melancholy. ""On a clear day I can see my old house and my
    wife,"" intones Smith, still struggling against the passing seasons for an
    irrecoverable romance. 
    </p>
<p>
    After <em>Bamnan </em><em>and</em><em> Slivercork</em>'s Flaming Lips progressivism, <em>The Trials of Van Occupanther</em> may seem like a
    retreat. Yet
    despite all the shag-carpet throwbacks, Midlake's new one rises above
    retro pastiche to probe its central character, the lovelorn,
    calendar-confined Van Occupanther; spacey production and allusive songwriting
    mark the album as a present-day artifact. ""We'll pass by for the
    last time,"" the disc concludes, but surely a band this promising will be back for more.

    Reggae. Canada.</p><p>
    If that doesn’t seem like a logical pairing to you, you’re hardly to be blamed, but since the mid-1960s musicians from Jamaica and other West Indian nations carved out a scene for themselves in Toronto-- Canada’s most populous city. The music they made wasn’t all reggae-- many of these musicians also helped create Canada’s funk and soul scenes-- but nearly all of these Jamaicans, Barbadans, St. Vincentians, and Trinidadians had a background in ska, rocksteady, or reggae.</p><p>
    What developed in Toronto was not entirely unlike what happened in the West Indian communities in London (England, not Ontario)-- immigrants far from home creating something familiar. And the reggae names who showed up in Toronto-- either for extended stays or brief cameos-- weren’t exactly small potatoes. No less a figure than Jackie Mittoo-- the organist who helped define the very basis of reggae with the Skatalites, Soul Vendors, and Sound Dimension-- split time between Kingston and Toronto, operating an Ontario record store with Lord Tanamo and cutting records in both cities. Jackie Opel, Johnny More, Alton Ellis, Lloyd Delpratt, and Johnny (aka Johnnie) Osbourne are all here, but no one had a bigger role than guitarist Wayne McGhie, who wrote six of the 16 songs on this compilation and played on at least seven of them.
    </p>
<p>
    The material compiler Kevin “Sipreano” Howes and Light in the Attic have unearthed runs the gamut from hard funk to deep soul, reggae, soul jazz, and rock, and most of it is excellent. Jo-Jo Bennett puts on a clinic in throat-shredding soul on Jo-Jo &amp; the Fugitives’ “Fugitive Song”, but the group betters itself on the funky, McGhie-penned “Chips-Chicken-Banana Split”, a song that slides into a sweet pre-“Cold Sweat” James Brown groove stuffed with stabbing horns and rapid-fire backing harmonies. Bob and Wisdom check in with an amazing cover of Mac Davis’s “I Believe in Music” that really sells the idea of music as a salve for problems with sharp two-part harmonies, and McGhie’s short-lived band Ram mines the same funky rock ore as Sly Stone and Rare Earth on “Love Is the Answer”.
    </p>
<p>
    Delpratt and Osbourne each contribute instrumentals-- the organ and horns of Delpratt’s “Together” flow gorgeously, while Osbourne’s “African Wake” is one of the deepest roots tracks in the set. Noel Ellis, son of the great Alton Ellis, also heads for the roots on his blessed-out “Memories”, a song from 1983 that falls outside the timeframe of the rest of the set but feels like it belongs in its spot late in the running order as an arrow forward.
    </p>
<p>
    As great as all these songs are, there’s one particular track that stands out: The Cougars’ cover of “I Wish It Would Rain”, a Whitfield/Strong/Penzabene composition originally recorded by the Temptations. Though it has some rhythmic echoes of reggae in places, this song is so oddly arranged that it feels completely out of time or genre. The verses are minimally arranged, with Jay Douglas and Jackie Richardson trading leads over heartbeat drums and a lone, regular guitar chord. Smears of organ color the front and back of each verse, and there are two bridges of instrumental soul that rip right into the starkness of the verses with towering horns and thick bass. It’s an improbable interpretation, but it’s utterly haunting.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Jamaica to Toronto</em> is an interesting artifact for a few reasons. The quality of the music is obviously the most important of these, but there are some great storylines here as well. The free mixing of English-speaking West Indians in Toronto, the exodus from the poor environs of Jamaica (many of these musicians were from Montego Bay, across the island from Kingston, reggae’s ground zero) to Canada in search of a better life, and the creation of a northern micro-Jamaica where music was currency that bought you memories of home all have resonance as themes of their own. <em>Jamaica to Toronto</em> tells all of these stories through music, and they’re all worth hearing.

    Ejigayehu ""Gigi"" Shibabaw is almost certain to be filed in the ""world"" section of your local megastore-- the back of this CD case even says ""File under: world/Ethiopia."" In actuality, Gig's music is just another link in the ever-lengthening chain that girds the world in a pangaeic culture and doesn't deserve such a pigeonhole, despite the fact that she sings in Amharic. It's an imperfect world, though, one in which our way of thinking hasn't caught up to the reality of global interchange, so for now she'll slot right into our weird and essentially uninformative classification systems.</p><p>
    Ethiopia has a vibrant history of excellent pop music whose distinctive blend of traditional pentatonic scales with jazz and r&amp;b influences has persisted in spite of dictatorship, censorship, and war. The greatest curator of that music, and especially of the 1960s and 70s ""Swinging Addis"" scene, Francis Falceto, has criticized Gigi's work as being somehow impure. It's hard to see how the Ethio-jazz and r&amp;b that Falceto has done so much to preserve is any ""purer,"" whatever that might mean. What Gigi has done is stepped outside of Ethiopia to embrace electronic music and dub.</p><p>
    She's brought the guttural language, melismatic singing, and pentatonic scale with her, though, and puts a distinct Amharic spin on her otherwise polyglot records. Check the lineup on <em>Gold &amp; Wax</em>: producer Bill Laswell brings together musicians from Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America, including Bernie Worrell, Karsh Kale, Ustad Sultan Khan, Buckethead, Midival Punditz, and original Swinging Addis saxophonist Moges Habte. Naturally, Laswell gives the record a luscious low-end, and dub elements are never far from the surface, but he keeps it funky and adapts many of the old rhythms of the classic Black Lion and Sensation bands of the mid-70s. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Salam"", especially, has rhythmic echoes of classic Kaifa and Ahma 45s. With its triple meter and swaying bassline, the track plunges Habte's sax into a cavern of reverb while Gigi cuts loose. She alternates sharp enunciation with pure scat passages where she draws out long, tremulous notes and lets them take her where they will. The blend of these elements is so seamless that it's easy to forget that the tablas, drum sets, djembes, and congas you might hear cranking away in the same rhythm section were all developed in completely different parts of the world. 
    </p>
<p>
    If there's a criticism here, it's that the record can be a little <em>too</em> seamless. Laswell can get wrapped up in a texture and forget to focus the spotlight on his star. A few more standout hooks-- Habte has the only knockouts-- might have driven home the individual songs on their own terms, whereas the album as it stands feels almost continuous. A tendency to stretch the songs out well past five minutes contributes to this feeling. 
    </p>
<p>
    As a pure listening experience, though, <em>Gold &amp; Wax</em> is still worth having. I don't limit that recommendation to the usual marketgoers of the ""world music"" ghetto, either. In spite of its exotic elements, this is an accessible record for people brought up on all kinds of music, from P-Funk to Madonna. And if you're knee-deep in Mulatu and Tlahou Gessesse records, check this to see where the music they helped to liberalize has ended up. You may be surprised by how much you like it.

The kudos for this return to sonic form go to engineer Wharton Tiers, the guy that midwifed the creation of Helmet's first two albums, <em>Strap It On</em> and <em>Meantime</em>.  It helps, of course, that Page Hamilton has his hands all over the guitars on this album.  Second guitarist Chris Traynor strapped on the bass for these studio sessions, bridging the gap between Frank Bello's exodus to rejoin Anthrax and former Jets of Brazil member Jeremy Chatelain finishing up other commitments.  There's also a new drummer, the second since Helmet reconvened.  That this new rhythm section fails to gel as well with the front of the group as the original pairing of John Stanier and Henry Bogdan is a sad fact, but ultimately immaterial.  What matters most is, with <em>Monochrome</em>, Helmet is back to doing what they do best.</p><p>
    Caveats still apply, of course.  For one, Hamilton sounds an awful lot like a 46-year-old on this record.  His bark (available for your listening pleasure on ""Swallowing Everything"" and ""Bury Me"") used to be part drill sergeant, part drunk frat bro, and part Ozzy (pre-Rhoads).  Nowadays, it's hoarse, shrill, and, worst of all, weak.   That said, it does the job in the right situation, especially when he goes for (hopefully intentional) chuckles on ""Brand New"", screaming ""Now I need! Somebody! Just like you! Somebody! I can talk to!"" like a MySpace stalker.   Hamilton's other limited modes of vocal expression are also used effectively-- his bored moan is a perfect fit for the title track, while his regular singing voice (nasal, sneering) works well on snotty know-it-all songs like ""Money Shot"" (about you-know-what) and ""On Your Way Down"" (also self-explanatory).  Couplets like ""Up to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter/ Man, your feet don't even touch the earth"" also show that Hamilton's penchant for slappy lyrics remains intact.</p><p>
    Of course, basking in the glow of Hamilton's poetic muse takes a distant back seat to basking in the glow of that gorgeous guitar tone, the distinct razor-sharp sheen that made him a guitar gear god.  It can't save a turgid overlong stinker like ""Almost Out of Sight"" from nearly ruining the record, but it goes a long way toward making this album more enjoyable than it has any right to be.  Whatever magic Tiers worked in these sessions could probably be sold at medicine shows for a tidy profit.  This album covers a fair amount of ground-- ranging from the pseudo-balladry of ""Monochromatic"" to ""Howl"", a skronky 40-second instrumental that lets Hamilton exorcise his inner Van Halen (or Derek Bailey)-- but still manages to cohere without sounding like a patchwork mess (like 2004's <em>Size Matters</em>).  Some might take the title of the final track-- ""Goodbye""-- to be a not-so-veiled hint that this is the end.  However, with a new label footing the bill, an upcoming stint as the headliners for this year's Warped Tour, and a new album that revisit the group's glory days without resorting to crass nostalgia, there's a good chance that Hamilton could be getting his second wind.

    In
    the canon of great American duos, Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo-- better known
    as hip-hop’s paragons of icy minimalism, the
    Neptunes-- rank somewhere between Laurel &amp; Hardy and Hall &amp; Oates. So
    one’s got to wonder, with that pedigree, why the hell
    Pharrell would leave his longtime partner out of the production process for his
    debut solo album, I<em>n My Mind</em>? The dark curls and eccentric lazers in the Neptunes’ music
    have always been attributed, at least in part, to Hugo. One listen to Kenna’s
    overlooked 2003 post-new wave album <em>New Sacred Cow</em>-- produced entirely by Hugo--
    reveals the evil synths and cold kinetics he brings to Williams’ airy
    theatricality and bougie Turks &amp; Caicos yacht-rap.</p><p>
    Without that dark core, Pharrell is left to focus expressly on the bouncy and bounce-able.  Not that there’s anything wrong
    with his brand of quasi-philosophical, brazenly materialistic
    music-- see Jay-Z’s ""I Just Wanna Love U (Give It
    2 Me)”, for example. But stretched
    over the course of 16 songs, with few contributions from those who owe
    him for part of their success, leaves a moist, spoiled aftertaste. It’s all pizzazz, no pathos. <br/></p><p>
    Granted, there are impressive moments: The arresting “Keep It Playa”, featuring Slim Thug, features some rattling snares and a familiar series of
    guitar plucks that rumbles into a hilarious falsetto bridge about J. Lo’s ass. It's the same kind of breezy thrill afforded by “Frontin’”, Williams’ hit with
    Jay-Z from the 2003 compilation <em>The Neptunes
    Present...Clones</em>. However, that brings us to “Young
    Girl”, a mediocre paean to (maybe) underage ladies that sounds like a cross between very
    bad Prince-aping and “Sunshine”-era Jigga. It’s the first song in a truly ghastly second half of an album that didn't need to exist in the first place.
    </p>
<p>
    And it's all downhill from there. The less said about “Number 1”--
    perhaps Kanye West and Pharrell’s lowest four minutes ever-- the better. Even
    Pusha T of the Clipse strikes out on the limp “Stay With Me (Dim the Lights)”,
    a song that has me wondering what happened to the guy that laced Noreaga’s
    brain-bursting “Superthug”. Or Mystikal’s assiduous “Shake Ya Ass”. Or
    Britney’s irrefutable “I'm a Slave 4 U”.<br/>

    Williams’ hard sell on the album, more than a year ago, was a
    split work: Eight R&amp;B songs and eight rap songs, speaking to his production
    history. It was  also an opportunity for Skateboard P to spotlight not just his
    mosquito-throated singing style, but also his bric-a-brac cadence and
    elocution. Unfortunately, that's exactly what we get.
    </p>
<p>
    There’s no denying that Pharrell wasn’t completely built for this
    kind of forum, but the idea that a producer of his caliber can’t put together
    something resembling a likeable LP-- particularly in light of his endlessly
    amusing Gangsta Grillz mixtape, <em>In My Mind: The Prequel</em>-- is insane. Here,
    he’s shot himself in the foot. Where the mixtape exploded with enthusiasm and
    wit, <em>In My Mind</em> the album is corroded and ineffectual. Worse, it’s predictable. 
    </p>
<p>
    One
    of the album's few redeeming tracks comes early on “Best Friend”, an
    autobiographical ode to friendship in the face of struggle. At one point P raps
    about the exit and entrance of two important figures in his life: “Seventh
    grade it was cursed and sad/ But the gift left within it is when I first met
    Chad/ But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed/ Grandma died on
    12/19.” It’s a rare open-hearted moment, unaffected by “black Carl Sagan”
    proselytizing or BBC chain boasting. The brief but recognizable sample from
    Outkast’s “Ms. Jackson”, is a knowing nod to the kind of sentiment Pharrell
    looks to duplicate. Only, without a clear perspective or a best friend to hold
    his hand, he’s left with little but a cool T-shirt and a pair of new BAPE
    sneakers.

    This is the part where I should tell you about a one-album crash-and-burn wonder that
    shocked and changed the world.  But you already know the story-- pop
    music meets political dissent meets counter-culture zeitgeist meets
    an ossified establishment meets two fingers in the air.  Many a sentence could be spent recounting any number
    of publicity stunts or anecdotes that flower throughout the Sex Pistols'
    history and, of course, when telling
    their story special attention must
    be paid to Malcolm McLaren, the shameless svengali who used these loitering ruffians as clothes horses for his
    bondage-trouser boutique while dreaming of champagne, caviar, and
    chart-topping riches.  The importance of the Sex Pistols-- as a
    symbol, as a lightning rod, as a flashpoint-- cannot be overstated. 
    It transcends the songs they performed, the genre they epitomized,
    the lifestyle they sold to an entire generation.  But, of course,
    there's still the music to consider.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Even if the actual quality of the
    tracks comprising <em>Never Mind the Bollocks</em> has been
    subsumed by its overwhelming importance as the Rosetta Stone for the
    safety-pin set, that certain something is still there when the record's
    actually played.  It's there in Johnny Rotten's voice, as incisive
    and invictive a weapon as anything that's come in front of a
    microphone.  It's there in Steve Jones' one-trick guitar moves.  It's
    there when Paul Cook bangs on his cymbals.  It's even there when you
    imagine Sid Vicious standing to Rotten's right on stage, lip upturned
    slightly like a young Elvis, an audience member's spit rolling down
    his cheek like a defiant tear, looking like a proper punk rock bass
    player (even if his chops didn't match his pose, and even if original
    bassist Glen Matlock is actually the guy in the studio making the
    magic happen).  Where it's not, however, is in the plethora of
    posthumous releases-- compilations, demos, live recordings--
    foisted upon folks ever since the Pistols walked off the stage at
    Winterland.  Rotten's famous last words at that concert certainly
    ring in the ears of consumers that find themselves listening to yet
    another shitty version of “Satellite”.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Of all those <span class=""postbody"">extraneous</span> releases, <em>Spunk</em> was there first.  First issued (surreptitiously, of course) in the months before
    <em>Bollocks</em> hit record stores, this bootleg was
    comprised of demos from recording sessions with producer Dave Goodman
    mostly made before the release of the Pistols' debut.  The version that Castle Records sees fit to legitimately
    release 30 years later is a variant that was once called <em>No
    Future UK?</em>-- in addition to the 12 Goodman sessions,
    there are three more demos also dating from 1976.  The most notable
    thing about those three bonus tracks (versions of “Anarchy in the
    UK”, “Pretty Vacant”, and “No Fun”) is that they
    illustrate how fine a line there is between good Sex Pistols and
    crappy Buzzcocks.  “Pretty Vacant” in particular, with the echo
    on Rotten's vocals and the turgid pace of the performance, sounds an
    awful lot like the Shelley-Diggle Experience after one too many huffs
    of glue.
    </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    As for the actual <em>Spunk</em>
    tracks, McLaren has publicly expressed a preference for these
    demos over the more polished <em>Bollocks</em>.  He claims they give the
    listener a better sense of what the band was like live.  Given that
    he's rumored to have played part in releasing this bootleg back in
    1977, however, his opinion might be slightly suspect.  When
    in doubt, go with the well-worn path-- the version of any
    Sex Pistols track a listener will enjoy most is the one
    that's available on <em>Bollocks</em>.  <em>Spunk</em>
    does feature non-<em>Bollocks</em> tracks like “Satellite”
    and “Just Me” (released, as “I Wanna Be Me”, the B-side to
    the “God Save the Queen” single), but only the latter is worth listening to more than once.
    </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    The rest of the
    session features the band stumbling their way through <em>Bollocks</em>
    tracks.  The musicians seems to be taking the slow-and-steady
    approach, seemingly still finding their way through the songs. 
    Meanwhile, Rotten's haphazard mewling and howling is a long way from the disdainful
    sneer he'd perfect on the group's debut.  It ruins the classic tracks
    like “Anarchy” (here called, oddly, “Nookie”) and “God Save the Queen” (here called,
    appropriately, “No Future”).  His voice makes it even more difficult to
    slog through the lesser lights of <em>Bollocks</em>, like
    their “Roadrunner” ripoff “Who Was It” (better known as
    “E.M.I.”), or their happy-fun-time gay anthem “New
    York (Looking For a Kiss).”  If there's any service provided by
    <em>Spunk</em>, it's to show how remarkable <em>Bollocks</em>
    actually is.
    </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Ideally, this set of tracks would be
    paired with <em>Bollocks</em> in a multi-disc configuration. And 10 years ago, Virgin UK
    did re-issue <em>Bollocks</em>, and included a bonus disc that
    featured the <em>Spunk</em> sessions and other demo
    recordings.  Unfortunately, folks curious to hear this particular
    configuration of well-worn Pistols tracks  will have to settle for
    purchasing this collection all by its lonesome. Those looking for
    some heretofore revelatory insight into the inner workings of the Sex
    Pistols will have to settle for the knowledge that, yes, the
    legendary Sex Pistols can sound just as shitty as any other
    run-of-the-mill punk band.

    Kentuckian Mark Fosson grew up as a skinny kid in the 1960s. Too small to make
    his high school football team, he got a guitar instead. Years later, from
    1971-1974, he honed his skills on the instrument while killing time in
    the Air Force, eventually making a demo. There was exactly one place at that time to
    send a vocal-less solo acoustic guitar tape: John Fahey's already
    legendary (and, by then, almost defunct) Takoma Records. Included in this Drag City release, <em>The Lost Takoma Sessions</em>, is the critique card Fahey wrote upon receipt of that demo; it reads, ""Sighn Him Quick"".
    The spelling was characteristic of Fahey, as was a more general
    malfeasance: By the time Fosson made it to Takoma's studios-- with a new mane of
    freshly permed hair and his guitar-- it  was sunk into the kind of
    debt that had plagued Fahey his entire life. The master sold Takoma to
    Chrysalis, drank
    himself into another marriage, then handed Fosson his masters back.
    Fosson, his chance near-missed, handed the tapes off to his garage,
    where they sat for nearly 20 years.</p><p>
    The upside of entering the frenetic Fahey orbit is that rediscovery
    and rehabilitation are as fundamental to the myth as the players
    themselves; so when Fosson's cousin discovered Fahey for herself, in
    this decade, his moment was again yet to come. Tiffany Anders, the
    cousin, made some inquiries: ""My grandmother called me an hour later
    and exclaimed, 'John Fahey! Shoot, I went on a date with him! We went
    to the Troubadour and all he said the entire night was ‘I'm scared!'""
    Anders tracked her cousin down, one thing led to another, and <em>The Lost Takoma</em> <em>Sessions</em> were reborn.</p><p>
    Clad in typeface echoing Tom Weller's work on early Fahey covers-- large, bubbly letters, equal parts psychedelic and graffiti-- <em>Takoma Sessions</em> is the last great record Takoma was never able to release. As a testament to how well Fosson plays, Fahey also scrawled on the tape, ""best demo tape I've heard since Kottke"". Where Fahey's manner was deeply steeped in blues, minor scales,
    and funereal syncopations, Fosson expresses far less pathos and far
    more, well, sunshine; rather than stomp or wail, he saves his most
    expressive moments for mutes, slides, harmonics-- he has a light touch,
    literally.
    </p>
<p>
    Fosson, when he plays, drones not with the bass note (as Fahey
    did-- it sounds like death himself knocking at your door) but with the
    higher end of his picking pattern. Thus the gravity in his play shifts,
    as he feints one way or another (one song is called ""Variations on a
    Thumb""). It also allows him to riff more than many in the Am Priv
    school: ""Jubilaya"" sees him rip off flurries of precise and clean
    harmonic mutes, breaking up his flow so he can slap right back with it.
    Or he'll sound accents with string bends (in this, he sounds something
    like his now contemporary Currituck Co.) and hammer-ons, as he does on
    ""Wind Through a Broken Glass"".
    </p>
<p>
    Technical skill isn't all: Fosson is also a purely
    American-sounding player. The raga, drone, and concrete that
    almost inevitably make their way into solo players' repertoire are
    largely absent in Fosson's play. ""Quarter Moon"" evokes lazy, deep,
    Southern riverbanks and muddy sun-drenched afternoons; ""Chillicothe""
    occurs on the same day, but later, as the light fails and the players
    have reported to their own porches and families. It's uniquely
    beautiful.
    </p>
<p>
    On the way, apparently, is a more recent collection of
    Fosson's work. Finally, after 30 years, it looks like he will again
    have a go at a career slinging his guitar around the country. This is
    good news: <em>Lost Sessions</em>,
    as lovely as it often is, also sounds like an artifact. We need more
    living artists on this same tip, working with the younger
    generation-- of which Jack Rose, the Philadelphia-based guitar player,
    is by far the most serious-- so that music as good as this doesn't stay
    stuck in past.

    White Whale may hail from land-locked Kansas but on <em>WWI</em> that doesn't stop the band from dreaming of life on the high seas. Throughout the album, imagery of admirals, ships, and overseas travel ride the crest of the band's anthemic rock-- which is often as expansive as the ocean itself. Musically, it's the stuff of 1970s rock radio: Melodic verses give way to huge choruses as the band chugs along with both toughness and panache.</p><p>
    There's also a generous hint of glam, courtesy of former Butterglory member Matt Suggs' breathily dramatic delivery and impressively constructed, elliptical lyrics, which are so full of effortless alliteration and internal rhymes that, as on David Bowie's ""The Bewlay Brothers"", it takes a while to realize that he isn't saying a damn thing. On the downtempo intro to ""Fidget and Fudge"", Suggs feigns meaningful statement, declaring, ""Oh, what parasites we are/ Sniffing through the darkness with our snouts."" Elsewhere, he surrenders to wordplay and silliness, as on opener ""Nine Good Fingers"", where he urges a lover to ""lay your nine good fingers on me"" and ""keep that lone one wrapped in gauze."" As capably as the band-- which also includes three members of Thee Higher Burning Fire and the Get Up Kids bassist Rob Pope-- <em>rocks</em>, it's Suggs' theatrical charisma that steals the show.</p><p>
    White Whale's roots may be in classic rock, but the band still has the good sense to embellish its music with less expected accents. When, in ""O'William, O'Sarah"", the middle section boils down to a bass line and reserved drumbeat for several minutes, the rest of the band keep things interesting with circular piano flourishes, screeching guitar, and chaotic, megaphone-treated vocals. On ""The Admiral"", <em>WWI</em>'s best song, the tune is introduced with programmed beats, burbling synth bass, and a whirling delay effect before transitioning to more organic instrumentation.
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, as with music that draws from familiar musical influences, White Whale occasionally lapse into more predictable territory. If it weren't supported by more compelling material, ""Nine Good Fingers"" would be bar-band fare. And their stabs at lo-fi experimentation, like ""I Love Lovely Chinese Gal"" and ""King's Indian"", just don't float, particularly alongside standouts like ""The Admiral"" or ""What's an Ocean For?"" In the end, <em>WWI</em> shows promise, and Suggs all but declares his dedication to the band's cause, singing on ""One Prayer"": ""We must not forget, dear/ It's our duty to go down with the ship.""

    Rappers hoping to age gracefully don't have many established career-paths to
    follow. Rap moves fast, and it doesn't have a whole lot of reverence for its
    pioneers. That's why you hear rappers as young as Bow Wow talking about
    retirement-- they know that their audience will retire them if they don't first
    gracefully bow out. A few career paths are already in place: Rappers can become
    actors (Ice-T, Queen Latifah), they can associate themselves with reality shows
    (Flavor Flav, DJ Run), or they can launch sad attempts at comeback albums (LL
    Cool J, Brand Nubian). That's about it. Ice Cube has done all three.</p><p>
    After <em>Anaconda </em>and <em>XXX: State of the Nation</em> and <em>Are We There
    Yet?</em>, it's hard to remember a time when Ice Cube was the scariest man in
    the United States, but there's a reason he's a hip-hop legend. On NWA's <em>Straight
    Outta Compton</em> and his first three solo albums, Cube represented loads of
    people's repressed feelings. He combined a violent gangsta nihilism with a
    fiercely militant take on Public Enemy's politicized black nationalism, and he
    somehow managed to find a way to transpose all this rage and righteousness into
    the persona of a young black everyman. Between 1988 and 1992, Cube was maybe
    the most important rapper alive, and when the L.A. riots exploded in 1992, it
    seemed like a vindication of his bleak worldview.</p><p>
    But that was a long time ago. Ice Cube hasn't released an album in six years;
    he's spent the past decade much more involved in film than music. Onstage at BB
    King's in New York a few months ago, he said that he'd stayed in music not for
    the money but because he's ""a goddam B-boy for life."" It's an admirable
    sentiment, and <em>Laugh Now, Cry Later</em> is dripping with the seething rage
    he's always had, but it's not enough. When Cube tries to switch between
    political fury and gangsta cliché, he ends up with a line like this: ""When
    niggas get tribal/ It's all about survival/ And ain't nobody liable."" 
    </p>
<p>
    It's the same stuff he's always done, except
    clumsier and less specific. And his lucid moments come weighed down with
    non-sequitur shoutouts to celebrity colleagues (""Robert Downey hit the bong"")
    and allegations that Martha Stewart ate pussy in prison. He's been living in a
    celebrity bubble for so long that half of his lyrics have become totally inexplicable,
    and his battle-rap skills have deteriorated to the point where he's dropping
    WTF howlers half the time: ""I know a lot of dancers/ They call me Jolly
    Ranchers/ Because I shine like Rudolph, nigga, fuck Prancer,"" ""I heard you lost
    on <em>Fear Factor</em>/ Cuz you couldn't swallow these nuts, big as a tractor.""
    Cube is at his best when he grounds himself in his own past, reflecting on his
    come-up over the sunny beat of ""Growin Up"". The rest of the time, who the fuck
    even knows what he's talking about.</p><p>
    In the past, Cube has had vivid soundscapes to rely on: Dr. Dre's skeletal
    lope, the Bomb Squad's hectic noise-clusters. But here, he's saddled with
    sleek, expensive, thoroughly generic tracks from the likes of Lil Jon and Scott
    Storch. Cube never once drops the sneer from his voice, and he enunciates hard
    enough that every one of his god-awful lines comes through clearly-- not a good
    thing. A stuck-on-autopilot Snoop Dogg wanders through a couple of times.
    Everything about <em>Laugh Now, Cry Later</em> feels utterly tapped of
    inspiration and vitality, and Cube's former greatness only makes this
    exhausting slog that much more depressing. Someone should hurry up and
    greenlight <em>Barbershop 3</em> so we don't have to deal with another of these
    any time soon.

    XTC almost never wrote a sentimental song-- which is strange, when you consider how
    much of their music deals with nostalgia, home and country, and yearning.<span> </span>Their lyrics are bittersweet
    and escapist, but even in the lost summers of <em>Skylarking</em>, they cling to
    some element-- biting words, knuckle-cracking hooks, or just a distractingly
    loud arrangement-- that keeps their most heartstring-pulling,
    young-love-eulogizing songs from drifting away.<span></span>
    Which is why their 1999 release <em>Apple Venus Vol. 1</em> is so much more
    complicated and concrete than a first impression suggests. That album,
    plus its 2000 counterpart <em>Wasp Star (Apple Venus Vol. 2)</em>, came out
    after a break of seven years. In that time, Andy Partridge, Colin
    Moulding, and Dave Gregory-- who formally left the band before these
    albums were released-- walked out on Virgin, stayed home making demos,
    and came back with this pair of records on TVT.  And five years and no
    further material later, XTC have packaged them together in the <em>Apple Box</em>,
    along with lyrics, liner notes, and two demos-and-outtakes albums.</p><p>
    And
    as far as anybody knows, these really are the “last” XTC albums-- so we can
    look at them from the perspective of the end of their career.<span> </span>For example, Partridge has often written
    about his native England from a small town perspective, particularly on <em>Mummer </em>and <em>Skylarking</em>.<span> </span>But <em>Apple
    Venus Vol. 1 </em><span>takes </span>his
    vision of England further than any of their past albums.<span> </span>Pizzicato strings that land like piercing
    raindrops introduce opener “River of Orchids"", on which Partridge dreams
    that the asphalt covering modern England is ripped up and replaced by flowers.
    From there, he leads us to an older, semi-pagan version of his native land:
    people hear the Celtic Greenman from inside the town church, they farm, flirt,
    wed, and worship, and Partridge sings about them like a guy who doesn’t have a
    care in the world beyond his own village.</p><p>
    The
    orchestrations give it a sweep and a scale unlike anything in their catalog,
    and while Moulding’s throat’s getting rougher, Partridge’s vocals have grown
    more beautiful and less affected with age.<span>
</span>The first half of the set is full of unbridled joy, and tunes like “I’d Like That”
    burst like a kid with a mouth full of strawberries.<span> </span>You’d expect the album to get mushy, dreamy and ultimately,
    lost-- but Partridge never lets that happen.<span>
</span>Near the end, the perspective gets older and reveals a hard
    undercurrent.<span> </span>The “longing look” in
    “Harvest Festival” inspires one of the most perfect songs Partridge has ever
    written, but it’s perfect because it’s so spare; the gushy memories have grown
    into sweet regret.<span> </span>And “The Last
    Balloon” closes the record with an eerie take on the circle of life: We’re all
    boarding a balloon to somewhere better, but to save it from sinking, Partridge
    urges the children to push the rest of us off: “We're weighed down by our evil past…Drop us
    all like so much sand.”
    </p>
<p>
    The
    starkest track, “Your Dictionary”, is also the only autobiographical one.
    Partridge wrote it about his divorce, and the blunt lyrics-- “S-H-I-T-- Is that
    how you spelt ‘me’ in your dictionary?""-- slam a door on his marriage.<span> </span>But at the end, the song doesn’t succumb to
    bitterness: The last section has the bell-ringing occasion of a ceremony,
    changing it from a “fuck you” to something kind of positive-- a wedding
    in reverse.
    </p>
<p>
    The
    theme of breaking and remaking comes back on <em>Wasp Star (Apple Venus Vol. 2)</em>.<span>
</span>Not much connects its 11 songs except that they’re the electric pop
    alternative to the other disc’s “orchustic” sound, and they blare along like
    one big encore. <em><span> </span>Wasp Star </em>also has a reputation as one of
    their weakest albums, which is probably fair; even the catchiest songs--
    “Stupidly Happy"", or<span> </span>“I’m The Man Who
    Murdered Love”-- are B-list for XTC.<span>
</span>The album works best when it’s breezy, like the clattering, clomping
    rhythms of “You and the Clouds Will Still Be Beautiful”-- or when it gets
    heavy, and you sense that they’re celebrating because the end is near.
    </p>
<p>
    Moulding’s
    “Boarded Up”, about a backwater concert hall that can’t draw the big acts
    anymore, sounds like an older rocker’s lament about how much better things were
    in his day.<span> </span>But the cut that really
    caps off the band is the closer, “The Wheel and the Maypole”.<span> </span>Starting with a clever series of
    euphemisms-- “I’ve got the plough if you’ve got the furrow/ I’ve got the rabbit
    if you’ve his burrow home”– it gets to the point at the chorus: to make a new
    thing, sometimes you have to break an old one. In the record’s strongest
    moment, Partridge sings, “If the pot won’t hold our love/Then we’ll dash it to
    the ground.”
    </p>
<p>
    “The
    Wheel and the Maypole” reads as a “happy” divorce song, escatically treating
    the marriage’s end as just the course of things.<span> </span>He could have written it about his ex-wife, or even about the
    fights that forced Gregory out of the band-- a “man’s divorce,” as
    Partridge has called it.<span> </span>But
    ultimately, nothing ties the lyrics to any specific drama in his life, which is
    par for the course.<span> </span>Ever since XTC’s
    early days, Partridge never wrote about himself, so much as he wrote about the
    things that concerned him.<span> </span>You can
    piece together impressions of his life from all of their albums, from the fast
    pace and frantic ambition of the early years, or the slowing down when they
    stopped touring and moved back to the countryside, or his mid- and late-1980s
    songs about settling down with a family.<span>
</span>But the autobiography stays at the level of the themes.
    </p>
<span> </span>
<p>
    When these two “comeback” albums came out, and Partridge emerged from hiding as
    a candidate for self-absorbed middle age, it was a relief that he didn’t use
    these albums as a chance to obsess about himself, or to air his grievances in
    the public square.<span> </span>Unlike so many of
    his “dad rock” peers, he never acts like he deserves special attention or
    preferential treatment, and he doesn’t think he’s any safer from the circle of
    life than the rest of us; he’s as grubbily mortal as anybody in Swindon, and
    that perspective makes these albums exhilarating.
    </p>
<p>
    Life can’t start unless it ends.<span> </span>The bitter leads to the sweet and back to the bitter.<span> </span>In “The Wheel and the Maypole”, which as far
    as we know is the last song on the final XTC album, they sever ties, push off
    one member, and maybe break up for good.<span>
</span>Partridge and Moulding never promise that this will lead to anything
    good: That would be sentimental.<span> </span>But
    what can you do?<span> </span>Eventually, we’ve all
    got to make way for something.

    already in its bleak post-apocalyptic stage, the second- and third-tier nu-garage bands are now left
    fighting for their relevancy and survival. Like failed revivalists
    Soundtrack of Our Lives, French Kicks and, to a lesser extent, the
    Raveonettes, Razorlight entered pop's ken with a flourish. They were <em>Up All Night</em>,
    bestowing us with glimpses of London nightlife at its most chic and
    youthful. Their shtick, lifeless and constructed from
    their contemporaries' leftover parts, lacked the originality of the Raveonettes' draconian B flat key signatures
    but looked purdy enough to the tune of a million-plus records sold.
    Funny then that this bland self-titled followup finds these guys seemingly disillusioned and full of ennui.</p><p>
    Almost as a defense mechanism for their disproportionate
    success-to-talent ratio, Razorlight's decided to not only turn their
    amps down, they're angling to dissociate themselves from the garage-rock scene
    entirely, playing pensive where they previously partied. There's a lot
    of attempts at answering the who, what, where, whens, and hows of love--
    not to mention a boatload of soul-searching and awkward self-awareness.
    Even worse, they've jettisoned nearly all their Strokes, Television, and
    other grab bag post-punk propensities, turning instead to adult alternative as a foundation for this late-20s
    midlife crisis. I guess if ya can't beat 'em, just quit and make soft
    rock!</p><p>
    Opener ""In the Morning"" shows the band toeing the line
    between sprightly garage rock and ""mature,"" reflective grownup pop.
    While the band cops a Franz Ferdinand swagger, the crime here lies in frontman
    Johnny Borrell's woe-is-me pathos, a stab at ""so we beat on, boats
    against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past""-levels of
    profundity. Problem is, in his pot/kettle words it's ""The songs on the radio sound
    the same/ Everybody just looks the same."" Plus, on lines like, ""Remember when you were young?"", the
    26-year-old's wistfully recounting
    the <em>Up All Night</em> days when ""every night's still so much fun."" Are we
    supposed to believe Borrell leads a boring life now? ""Who Needs Love?"" seems to indicate this is
    the case. It's a limp take on Springsteen's ""Hungry Heart"" that espouses a
    totally opposite message. Borrell tweaks his vocals for a bare-boned,
    Brit Daniel delivery on a song that rejects romance and compassion.
    </p><p>
    Sadly, those lyrical disasters take place on the album's <em>stronger</em>
    songs. While not nearly as blasphemous, tracks like ""America"" and ""Fall
    to Pieces"" scrape the bottom of the barrel, the former sounding even
    tackier than the Neil Diamond song of the same name, while the latter
    sounds like romantic comedy soundtrack fodder, an amalgamation of 90s ""alt-rock"" sensations such as
    Counting Crows and the Rembrandts. What gall then when they update R.E.M.'s
    classic ""Pop Song 89"" to ""Pop Song 2006"", a slapdash salute to the
    Athens group with the flag at half mast. Of course, such braggadocio's
    expected when Borrell's actually convinced he's our generation's Dylan.
    He's right too, although he should've specified Jakob and not Bob.

    the most casual Current 93 fan knows David Tibet's career has tended 
    toward rue and malice: cracked spiels, sunken solemnity, opiate apocalypses. 
    Of course, this has been going on since the early 1980s, but his past 
    few albums have depicted an ever-expanding arena of anxiety and resignation. 
    Tibet's recent output has been one decade-long spiritual crescendo, 
    pitting atheists and junkie academics against blind blues oracles and 
    Rapture-rousing dispensationalists. On 2004's <em>Halo</em> and this 
    year's <em>Sleep Has His House</em>, the loosely organized outfit had 
    maximized all of its most intriguing elements-- musical asceticism, 
    mind-wrecked mysticism, intellectualism-- without lapsing into total self-parody. <em>Black Ships Ate the Sky </em>
    continues the trend with an extraordinary conceptual breadth (a formal 
    song cycle based on a Methodist hymn) and some of Tibet's best songwriting 
    in a decade.</p><p>
    Structurally, <em>
    Ships </em>is anchored by eight versions of Charles Wesley's ""Idumea"", 
    a 1763 paean to doom and uncertainty: ""A land of deepest shade/ Unpierced 
    by human thought/ The dreary regions of the dead/ Where all things are 
    forgot."" Eighteenth-century hymns are not known for their entertainment 
    value, and Tibet hedges his bets by enlisting a cadre of young sycophants 
    (including Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, Antony, and Six Organs of Admittance's Ben 
    Chasny). Each performance is unique, and yet the cumulative 
    effect is cyclical: One Armageddon precedes another. Marc Almond's 
    rendition situates an echoing Appalachian falsetto in the place where 
    ""flaming skies"" break asunder. Bonnie's serrated rasp cuts through 
    banjo drones. Baby Dee bristles with stormless rage and cool regret. 
    The two irrefutable stars are Antony, whose doubled vibrato sounds like 
    a shelf of glassware, and Shirley Collins, who slowly turns her honeyed 
    voice into gravel.</p><p>
    Tibet 
    mentions that the album's conceptual scheme comes from ""a dream 
    I had that Black Ships had entered our skies in preparation for the 
    arising of the final Caesar and for the Second Coming of Christ."" 
    Regardless of one's disposition toward sin and redemption, that idea 
    is certainly enough to warrant a full album, and Tibet is nearly unrivaled 
    as a ranting doomsayer. He observes that ""flying moons scare children,"" 
    proclaims that he is ""the king of the Eucharist,"" and obliges listeners 
    to ""kill Caesar like black ships eat skies."" That solid advice is 
    administered with weaving violins and a guitar that howls from the galley. 
    Even in an era of freak-folk minstrelsy, Tibet makes nonsense sound 
    genuinely harrowing. As always, you can accept his imagery as a profound 
    allegory of warfare and disaster, or you could just read it as a sophisticated 
    treatise on lunacy. A sentimental favorite is ""The Autistic Imperium 
    Is Nihil Reich"", a funerary waltz at which Tibet delivers the eulogy: 
    ""I want to make love with the umbrella ladies who inhabit the stealing 
    time."" He is backed by dust storms, creaky floorboards, and streaking 
    violas. The songs are incendiary and cosmic: solar flares and vibratory 
    crackles on ""The Dissolution of the Boat"", steel-plated screams 
    on ""Black Ships Seen Last Year of Heaven"", the slow contractions 
    of a melodica on Clodagh Simonds' ""Idumea"".
    As 
    a further development of the apocalyptic narrative, the album becomes 
    less reliant on acoustic austerity and folk balladry. ""Black Ships Were Sinking"" drums up lashing typhoons of metal filaments, 
    gibbering cellos, and cybernetic locust. ""Black Ships Ate the Sky"" 
    is probably Tibet's most savage song since the early 1990s, a disconcerting 
    concentration of hemorrhaging drums and lo-fi thrash. But these brash 
    interludes hardly detract from the general sensation of suspension and 
    cessation. In fact, Tibet's finest achievement is compiling mournful 
    songs into an album with obvious momentum and tension. Like all Current 
    93 projects, <em>Ships </em>is bloated, but this is more of an inevitability 
    than an accident. Despite patches of plodding esoterica, <em>Black Ships</em> 
    builds elegy and aggression into hell-fire incantations. It's a mesmeric 
    album made for midnight crackpots, acid-addled prophets, and nebbish 
    posers.</p></div>"|9224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9224-black-ships-ate-the-sky/|8.0|Alex Linhardt

    In the four years between this, Mike Johnson's fifth album, and his previous
    one, <em>What Would You Do</em>, he seems to have replaced his music's abject
    sadness with anger. In a sense, the way he's gone from sweeping, country and
    folk-influenced sad-rock to noisy, straightforward guitar overload echoes Neil
    Young's many transitions between the two sounds, though Johnson sings more like
    Leonard Cohen or Kurt Wagner. Of all his albums, this is the least like his
    work with Mark Lanegan and the closest he's come to sounding like Dinosaur
    Jr., the band he played bass for in the 1990s.</p><p>
    Johnson and his backing band, the Evildoers, kick up an unholy racket worthy
    of the moniker. Drummer Jason Albertini and bassist Jim Roth (Built to Spill)
    stir the sludge at the bottom of the mix, while Johnson and guitarist Brett
    Nelson trade nasty fuzz and grotesque hammer-ons. Bookended by a couple of
    folky acoustic guitar teases titled ""In"" and ""Out"", the
    album slugs its way through acrid songs with biting intensity. Johnson's
    deadpan hook of ""I'm on track now"" in ""On Track"" is catchy
    despite being barely sung, his matter-of-fact delivery serving as a
    counterweight to the crunchy grind of the band.</p><p>
    Junior Byles' ""Fade Away"" is nearly unrecognizable in the middle
    of the record. It sounds like a Black Heart Procession track, especially since
    Nelson's backing vocals bear a striking resemblance to Pall Jenkins.
    ""Can't Get it Right"" is the album's great meltdown, guitars pushed so
    hard they bleed white noise, while the title track is a 4 a.m. pub crawl
    ending in the back seat of a filthy taxi. Johnson's usual rural tinges find
    their way into ""If the World Hadn't Gone Insane"", a 6/8, pedal
    steel-touched ballad that begins its message of devotion with the lines,
    ""Well maybe it's the drugs/ Or maybe it's the way you never watch your
    mouth."" 
    </p>
<p>
    So Mike Johnson hasn't really cheered up so much as found a new way to
    channel his disappointment. The result is an album that echoes the tough and
    noisy street outside the bar more than the beer-staring inaction of the
    interior. In hitting so hard, the record occasionally sacrifices some of its
    tunefulness, but on balance, Johnson's misery is as enjoyable as it's ever
    been.

    What do you do when the guiding light for your pompous,
    under-the-pavement-the-beach antics, Sweden's Refused, turn up fucking dead
    the very same year your band starts, and then their stateside heir-apparent,
    Amherst's Orchid, also stop barricade-storming and break up right after they've
    visited you in Europe? If you're Norway's JR Ewing, you write a song called
    ""For We Are Dead"" (""Death came and turned my bones to dust and
    scattered me onto the floor,"" whispers singer Andreas Tylden) and then you
    break up too! Find the bad news on their website, where they sign off
    characteristically: ""Repetition Is Failure.""</p><p>
    So also went the title of the first track on their last one, 2003's <em>Ride
    Paranoia</em>, which included for lyrics a bit about ""Stop cutting the hair
    and start living for a change."" By then, JR Ewing had done away with the
    Minor Threat haircuts and San Diego blastbeats they wore for the Coalition
    Records-style hardcore of 2000's <em>Calling In Dead</em> and 2001's <em>The
    Perfect Drama</em>, and had instead started living by paying-up the production
    and making a record critically acclaimed for its, um, ""<a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/18925/JR_Ewing_Ride_Paranoia"">intelligent
    obliteration</a>."" This, I guess, has become the gold-standard for post-Refused
    Euro acts that do the slashing guitar thing-- politics scooped out of Born
    Against's trashcan and forcibly mated with the dynamic changes from a <em>The
    Shape of Punk to Come</em> practice tape.</p><p>
    Of course, the advantage of actually cutting the hair is economy. I
    caught JR Ewing in Europe circa <em>The Perfect Drama</em>, where the idea was
    that they were so into chaos that they ended up making sweated-out and
    to-the-point treble blasts that matched their freedom-forward politic with
    headlong aural adrenaline. Living for a change was what they did next-- though
    they later had second thoughts and named <em>Maelstrom</em>'s first song ""Change is Nothing (Everything Is)""-- and this living, maybe hopefully, is
    the period of time for which they wrote ""Fucking and Champagne"",
    another track from the new one. Living though, as Refused et. al. had already
    discovered, is a tougher trick than nihilism.   
    </p>
<p>
    So maybe ""Change is Nothing"" is defensive-- the kind of thing that
    people who've gained weight or lost their girlfriend say. JR Ewing might say it
    to shrug off the fact that right at the point where their old songs would come
    to a lurching halt, their new ones pick back up with a bloated acoustic guitar
    break, followed by a guitar solo. Even more pounds show on songs like ""Take
    a Hint"", which throws a barbershop quartet into the background.   
    </p>
    Of
    Europe's turn of the century class-- Yage in Germany, Kaospilot and JR Ewing in
    Norway, Amanda Woodward in France-- JR Ewing are now the last band standing,
    but they've outgrown their form just as fully as their former counterparts.
    Tylden's sneering wail has become, on <em>Maelstrom</em>, Mike Patton's falsetto,
    while the guitars are now hopelessly charged with filling up the space their
    riffs were originally designed to elide. Personality over fury, as on
    ""Nihilistic Elitist"", which wastes perfectly good Hot Snakes guitars
    on a slow-motion dragger, is an understandable choice but also a dead end. They
    need a new band to do what they want to do now, and presumably, they'll have one
    soon. As for bothering with this one at all, now that we know the jig is up,
    see track eight: ""I'm Sorry, You're Sorry, We're All Sorry.""</div>"|9197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9197-maelstrom/|4.4|Zach Baron

Each package     contains one CD, for the remastered album, and one DVD, featuring a     pointless 5.1 Surround Sound mix, a small handful of bonus tracks     (playable only via DVD), and a 20-minute talking-head documentary on     the making of the album and the corresponding period in the band’s     career. The decision to include those documentaries seems telling, and     it seems like a struggle to get at the one thing that reissues-- no     matter how many B-sides or demos they throw at you-- can rarely     capture: How and why a band in question seemed so very cool <i>at the time</i>.</p>
<p>That turns out to be a big issue with Depeche Mode. These days, the     sound of their older records seems less like a revelation and more like     a given: The band’s vibe has evaporated out into America to the point     where you can spot it in anything you want, whether it’s Linkin Park,     Marilyn Manson, or Britney Spears. (Rather incredible, for a British     group.) These days, their carefully crafted look has them resembling a     failed Hungarian metal band and their reputation is just that of a big,     respectable, slightly drama-queeny pop act-- idiosyncratic, maybe, but     hardly that unusual. New listeners cannot expect to hear these albums     quite the way their fans did at the time.</p>
<p>What’s funny is how that affects each of these records differently. With 1990’s <i>Violator</i>,     the band’s pop-crossover classic, it makes hardly any difference at     all; the way most people think about and imagine Depeche Mode was built     largely on this record. Interview subjects in the documentary have much     to say about how “perfect” the album is, how neatly and naturally it     matches the sounds and synths of “progressive technopop” with the kind     of grand songwriting that can play to massive stadiums. And they’re     right. Like any good crossover, this record needs no particular context     to appreciate, and listening back through, one gets a sense of why: The     battle they’re winning here, of giving electronic music the human feel     of teenage anthems and power ballads, is the same one still being     fought by any number of Germans; it’s not constrained by time. The dark     and slinky soul of the record-- the sex or drama-queen poses, the mix     of domineering threats and extreme tenderness-- don’t hurt either.</p>
<p>But in carrying its context with it-- and in being somewhat critical to today’s pop-- <i>Violator</i> just stands as a moving, solid, record, a classic for the archives of     popular music; it doesn’t so much carry a lot of the things that made     Depeche Mode feel so much <i>themselves</i>. With 1987’s <i>Music for the Masses</i>,     that stuff is all there-- which makes the music both harder to “get,”     from today’s perspective, and also more interesting. The Depeche Mode     of this album is the one that brought together a rabid audience of     trendy coastal kids and middle-American teens who got beat up over     stuff like this-- all of whom saw them not only as the peak of style,     but as something positively revelatory, something speaking only to them     (even in a crowded stadium), something alien and cool, disorientingly <i>kinky</i>,     and entrancingly strange. For many, this was probably one of the first     dance-pop acts they’d heard that didn’t seem to be entirely about being     cool and having a good time; their music had been dark, clattery, and     full of S&amp;M hints and blasphemy, and on this record it reached a     level of Baroque pseudo-classical grandness (see depressed-teenager     shout-out “Little Fifteen”) that lived up to those kids’ inflated     visions of the group.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, this Depeche Mode <i>could</i> be fun,     even in its minor keys: The go-to radio pick for this album was the     version of “Behind the Wheel” that segued into a cover of “Route 66”.     And it’s somewhere around that fact that we might recognize how far we     are from the mainstream “alternative” audience of the late-80s, a scene     we see in passing between the chatter of the documentary. Anyone     looking to understand that context, or just infatuated by the guy in     the front row of Depeche Mode’s Rose Bowl concert wearing a Fishbone     t-shirt, would do well to look to <i>Depeche Mode 101</i>, D.A.     Pennebaker’s tour film-- which, in a canny pre-""Real World"" move,     spends time following a group of fans who’ve won a chance to follow the     band on tour.</p>
<p>With the band’s 1981 debut, the increasingly adorable <i>Speak &amp; Spell</i>,     our distance from the original context actually makes things better. Of     course, this is not the Depeche Mode we know: The songs on this album     were written by Vince Clarke, who would shortly after leave the group     and find fame with Yaz and Erasure. And these, of course, are the early     days of synth-pop: These songs are building-block simple, bleepy and     discoid, and the band sounds as gawky and adolescent as Dave Gahan     looked. There’s something terrific in hearing this from a distance, not     as stylish futurism (not anymore) but as the happy noises of teenagers     who <i>believed</i> it to be stylish futurism-- and with a charming     earnestness. “Happy” because of, well, Vince Clarke, whose work with     Erasure is a testament to both his love of joyous disco-pop and his     ability to pack it full to bursting with emotion. The best tracks here     (like the Kraftwerk-y “New Life” and the dancefloor standard “Just     Can’t Get Enough”) are classics, and even the lesser ones-- packed as     they are with hooks and verve-- can charm you giddy, in the same way it     can charm you giddy to see Dave Gahan prancing around in a bow tie on     ""Top of the Pops"" in the documentary: He looks so young! And shy! And     they haven’t even started dressing like leather men yet!</p>

The decision to include those documentaries seems telling, and     it seems like a struggle to get at the one thing that reissues-- no     matter how many B-sides or demos they throw at you-- can rarely     capture: How and why a band in question seemed so very cool <i>at the time</i>.</p>
<p>That turns out to be a big issue with Depeche Mode. These days, the     sound of their older records seems less like a revelation and more like     a given: The band’s vibe has evaporated out into America to the point     where you can spot it in anything you want, whether it’s Linkin Park,     Marilyn Manson, or Britney Spears. (Rather incredible, for a British     group.) These days, their carefully crafted look has them resembling a     failed Hungarian metal band and their reputation is just that of a big,     respectable, slightly drama-queeny pop act-- idiosyncratic, maybe, but     hardly that unusual. New listeners cannot expect to hear these albums     quite the way their fans did at the time.</p>
<p>What’s funny is how that affects each of these records differently. With 1990’s <i>Violator</i>,     the band’s pop-crossover classic, it makes hardly any difference at     all; the way most people think about and imagine Depeche Mode was built     largely on this record. Interview subjects in the documentary have much     to say about how “perfect” the album is, how neatly and naturally it     matches the sounds and synths of “progressive technopop” with the kind     of grand songwriting that can play to massive stadiums. And they’re     right. Like any good crossover, this record needs no particular context     to appreciate, and listening back through, one gets a sense of why: The     battle they’re winning here, of giving electronic music the human feel     of teenage anthems and power ballads, is the same one still being     fought by any number of Germans; it’s not constrained by time. The dark     and slinky soul of the record-- the sex or drama-queen poses, the mix     of domineering threats and extreme tenderness-- don’t hurt either.</p>
<p>But in carrying its context with it-- and in being somewhat critical to today’s pop-- <i>Violator</i> just stands as a moving, solid, record, a classic for the archives of     popular music; it doesn’t so much carry a lot of the things that made     Depeche Mode feel so much <i>themselves</i>. With 1987’s <i>Music for the Masses</i>,     that stuff is all there-- which makes the music both harder to “get,”     from today’s perspective, and also more interesting. The Depeche Mode     of this album is the one that brought together a rabid audience of     trendy coastal kids and middle-American teens who got beat up over     stuff like this-- all of whom saw them not only as the peak of style,     but as something positively revelatory, something speaking only to them     (even in a crowded stadium), something alien and cool, disorientingly <i>kinky</i>,     and entrancingly strange. For many, this was probably one of the first     dance-pop acts they’d heard that didn’t seem to be entirely about being     cool and having a good time; their music had been dark, clattery, and     full of S&amp;M hints and blasphemy, and on this record it reached a     level of Baroque pseudo-classical grandness (see depressed-teenager     shout-out “Little Fifteen”) that lived up to those kids’ inflated     visions of the group.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, this Depeche Mode <i>could</i> be fun,     even in its minor keys: The go-to radio pick for this album was the     version of “Behind the Wheel” that segued into a cover of “Route 66”.     And it’s somewhere around that fact that we might recognize how far we     are from the mainstream “alternative” audience of the late-80s, a scene     we see in passing between the chatter of the documentary. Anyone     looking to understand that context, or just infatuated by the guy in     the front row of Depeche Mode’s Rose Bowl concert wearing a Fishbone     t-shirt, would do well to look to <i>Depeche Mode 101</i>, D.A.     Pennebaker’s tour film-- which, in a canny pre-""Real World"" move,     spends time following a group of fans who’ve won a chance to follow the     band on tour.</p>
<p>With the band’s 1981 debut, the increasingly adorable <i>Speak &amp; Spell</i>,     our distance from the original context actually makes things better. Of     course, this is not the Depeche Mode we know: The songs on this album     were written by Vince Clarke, who would shortly after leave the group     and find fame with Yaz and Erasure. And these, of course, are the early     days of synth-pop: These songs are building-block simple, bleepy and     discoid, and the band sounds as gawky and adolescent as Dave Gahan     looked. There’s something terrific in hearing this from a distance, not     as stylish futurism (not anymore) but as the happy noises of teenagers     who <i>believed</i> it to be stylish futurism-- and with a charming     earnestness. “Happy” because of, well, Vince Clarke, whose work with     Erasure is a testament to both his love of joyous disco-pop and his     ability to pack it full to bursting with emotion. The best tracks here     (like the Kraftwerk-y “New Life” and the dancefloor standard “Just     Can’t Get Enough”) are classics, and even the lesser ones-- packed as     they are with hooks and verve-- can charm you giddy, in the same way it     can charm you giddy to see Dave Gahan prancing around in a bow tie on     ""Top of the Pops"" in the documentary: He looks so young!

    Rhymefest vanquished Eminem in a battle 
    and won a Grammy with Kanye West, yet he's as anonymous as your garbageman. 
    He's been married (and divorced) to a regular girl and has a young 
    son to raise. He's mopped floors, cleaned highways, and punched the 
    mixtape clock for nearly a decade-- all of which presumably make 
    him a regular guy amongst so many millionaires. Yet he's also toured 
    the globe, signed to Clive Davis' label, and shaded his eyes with 
    Vuitton glass. Hardly garbage. The world is filled with regular guys, 
    though-- median-earners, and single-parents who split their checks between 
    baby food and Bape hoods-- so why does ‘Fest settle for common? He's 
    a good salesman. He's laying on the Willy Loman, but he's closer 
    to Arthur Miller, the author of a story about the <em>almost</em> in all 
    of us, which, in these times of rappers getting over, puts Rhymefest 
    in a middle-class seemingly all his own.  <br/></p><p>
    Of course, it's bullshit. Rhymefest 
    is no more working class than Ethel Kennedy at this point, but he's 
    managed to find his voice as the frustrated everyman amongst gangsters 
    (""blue collar"" is a mindstate, you see), the snarky asshole who 
    complains ceaselessly but somehow maintains a soft spot by being insightful, 
    humble, and, most importantly, funny.  He's schlubby, speaks 
    in a grumbling baritone routinely punctuated with a rising whine 
    or sweeping lisp, and often sounds like Andy Rooney covering ""Vapors""-- 
    all of which makes him the most compelling rapper currently spinning a 
    working-class-hero persona. The key in rap is not simply the 
    construction of persona, the ability to sculpt a monument to insecurity, 
    but to have some semblance of personality and charisma, to be <em>somebody</em>, 
    even if that somebody is objectionable. Otherwise, you're just some 
    pompous asshole with a microphone. Kanye's perfected this to the point 
    where he can show up to a party wearing a Yves St. Laurent shirt unbuttoned 
    to his pubes and white satin dinner gloves, Pamela Anderson in tow, 
    and nobody blinks.</p><p>
    Rhymefest is probably the guy who told him it 
    was a great idea, if only for his own enjoyment. He's part of the 
    very life he criticizes, his punchlines funnier because they're packed 
    with the details that make truth irrelevant. Lines like, ""Asking Kanye 
    for money just to pay my gas bill/ He asked me for it back/ Nigga, what's 
    up on your math skills?/ Nothin' plus zip equals zero/ Can you relate? 
    That nigga ain't been broke since ‘H to tha Izzo,'"" would be 
    intolerable if Rhymefest were not the capable prankster that he is, 
    telling stories that may or may not be based in truth, but close enough 
    to make us wonder. And Rhymefest treats the world as if it were some 
    tripping friend, George Bush no different from some silly dude in the 
    club. Only twice does ‘Fest get solemn, on late additions ""Bullet"", 
    a refix of Citizen Cope's ""Bullet and a Target"" (á la Lil' Wayne's 
    ""Shooter"") and ""Sister"", a not-so-surprisingly touching tribute 
    to the struggles of young women. These are his moments to prove he can 
    act serious, too, and he shows well for himself, although his earnestness 
    is better when cloaked in humor.  <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Rhymefest's oversized personality 
    also infects the big name producers on his album. Being buds with Kanye 
    and signed to super-connected Mark Ronson's boutique label put ‘Fest 
    in the boardroom with producers like Just Blaze, Cool &amp; Dre, Chicago 
    legend No ID, and Kanye himself, and each takes the opportunity to try 
    on more casual attire. Nearly every song sounds like it was pulled from 
    the producers' secret pop stash, beats that were too corny for Jay-Z, 
    too poppy for Rick Ross. And then there's Mark Ronson.
    </p>
<p>
    For those who've 
    had little success deriding Danger Mouse as a vicious crossover, Ronson's 
    your huckleberry. He samples The Foundations' ""Build Me Up, Buttercup"" 
    and the Strokes' ""Someday"", the former's chorus mauled by the 
    late Ol' Dirty Bastard. Ronson regularly strides a very fine line 
    between shameless pop and novelty, depending on your threshold, but 
    here only the ""Buttercup""-ing ""Build Me Up"" doesn't work. 
    But it's this willingness to be frivolous that distinguishes <em>Blue 
    Collar</em> and why it exceeds most anti-whatever records and competes 
    with the most strident street albums. It's something different, done 
    well.

    Guys, if you've ever felt like a loser while getting drunk over a girl,
    then you need to hear the Old 97's. Girls, if you've ever hooked up
    with a guy who you knew meant you no good, then the Old 97's are your
    band. Everyone else, get cracking. Few bands can appeal to both sexes
    while essentially differentiating them from one another, which is to
    the credit of Rhett Miller, who managed to create a compelling and
    complex musical persona during the mid to late 1990s. He could play the
    pathetic loser just as easily as the ""serial ladykiller."" both the
    dumper and the dumped, his own and everyone else's worst enemy. On song
    after song Miller-as-narrator does the wrong thing-- whether it's
    taking that young woman to bed, or allowing her to make him miserable,
    or just leaving his back door open for his lost cat-- even though he
    knows better.</p><p>
    This persona, to varying degrees fictional and autobiographical, fueled
    the Old 97's' endearing debut, two great alt-country albums, and two
    great-to-good pop albums before Miller settled down, dropped his
    worrying ways, and made two solo albums-- one a disaster and the other
    a fiasco. So after being dropped by Elektra and putting out a just-okay
    album and an overdue live album on New West, the Old 97's have released
    their very first best-of, which is a transparent attempt (as was the
    guest spot in <em>The Break-Up</em>) to gain a commercial foothold.</p><p>
    If there's any justice in the world, it'll work. Sure, there are some
    notable omissions: ""Wish the Worst"" (Miller's greatest loser anthem),
    ""Busted Afternoon"" (Miller's greatest chorus hook), and ""Book of Poems""
    (the band's greatest momentum), among too many others to name (""Big
    Brown Eyes"", ""Bel-Air"", ""Salome"", and on and on). But that's the case
    with just about any best-of, and besides, these 18 tracks aren't just
    uniformly good, they're all uniformly better than most everything else
    that came out of the too-reverent alt-country movement. 
    </p>
<p>
    The three chords that kickstart ""Stoned"", from the band's 1994 debut<em> Hitchhike to Rhome</em>,
    are a fitting introduction to the Old 97's, setting up that album's
    ramshackle sound and providing a perfect context for Miller's
    intelligent lyrics and tales of woman woes. Ken Bethea, who plays those
    chords, is the band's secret weapon, a guitarist with a gift for
    concise and eloquent riffs and solos that alternately finished Miller's
    sentences and pulled the rug out from under him. As a unit, the band
    could shift easily from the runaway-train momentum of ""Four Leaf
    Clover"" (a duet with X's Exene Cervenkova) to the chugging shuffle of
    ""Crying Drunk"" to the exquisite pop of ""Murder (or a Heart Attack)"",
    drawing from a wealth of sources that covered Merle Haggard to the
    Kinks. The songs on <em>Hit By a Train</em>-- which include a soundtrack cut, a B-side, and two live tracks from a <em>Satellite Rides</em>
    bonus disc-- reveal a band that's professional enough to keep the
    emphasis on Miller's songs but dynamic enough never to be overshadowed,
    even when the slick production of <em>Satellite Rides</em> values defanged them. 
    </p>
<p>
    The Old 97's went pop, as did many others associated with alt-country,
    although that step wasn't the big one fans and detractors often make it
    out to be. There was always a little country in their pop, a lot of pop
    in their country. So, while <em>Hit By a Train</em>
    has a distinct stylistic arc, tracks from their later albums perfectly
    complement those from their earlier ones. And at the core of every
    song, whatever its sound, is Miller himself, whose lyrics never lost
    their wit and whose persona never lost any of its conflicted
    shiftiness... at least not during the period covered by <em>Hit By a Train.</em> ""I believe in love,"" he exclaims on ""Rollerskate Skinny"", ""but it don't believe in me!"" We can all relate.

    Germany's
    Tied &amp; Tickled Trio are a jazz band, though not a trio-- they boast anywhere
    from six to 12 members depending on the day. I'm calling them a jazz band
    with no prefixes simply because they embody the senses of flight and
    adventurousness that characterized jazz in its various golden ages and still
    typifies the best of it today. Yes, their music has roots in punk and
    hip-hop and comes complete with a heavy slathering of fractured electronics,
    but it seems to me that jazz is amoebic enough to swallow all that and still
    retain its essence.</p><p>
    The band/collective is four albums into a career that's
    ostensibly a sideline to the Notwist, Lali Puna, and the numerous other bands
    that the Trio draws its members from; <em>A.R.C.</em>
    isn't quite a the group's fifth album-- though it offers plenty of material on its two discs. The
    audio disc consists of only the title track, a 19-minute thriller that
    spends its first three minutes shifting from beatific drone to funky glitch.
    The first saxophone enters at 3:08, cuing a journey into dark-hued exotica
    underpinned by a steady shuffle. This gives way to an impressive extended
    trombone solo by Gerhard Gschlöβl that drags the song into an abyss of heavenly
    drone. The rest of the
    piece is characterized by a mix of free interplay and steady rhythm, ultimately
    recapitulating to the layered horn arrangement that constitutes the head.</p><p>
    ""A.R.C."" gets a live reprise on the other disc, a DVD
    dominated by a December 2004 club date. The live sound on the video portion
    is ridiculously immaculate-- if you listen to it without watching you'd swear it
    was a studio session or radio date-- while the footage appears to have been shot
    with an assortment of drug store security cameras. The set opens with a fiery
    version of  ""The Long Tomorrow"", the
    lead-off track from <em>Observing Systems</em>
    and for my money their best piece of music to date, and the nine-piece ensemble
    just digs in to the lurching groove.
    </p>
<p>
    The DVD also sports a bevy of bonus bits, including a German
    TV appearance with an unsubtitled interview and obviously pantomimed
    performance. The funny thing about the miming is that they don't try at all to
    hide it-they brought along a bass clarinetist even though there's no bass
    clarinet in ""Tusovska Dub"", the song that's playing. A couple of good live
    performances and three music videos round things out. Welikenicethings' video
    for ""Revolution"" is especially great, featuring a bus tour by computer
    generated blue creatures of a supermarket where all of the products feature
    images of Che Guevara, Mahatma Gandhi, Baader-Meinhof members, Fidel Castro, and assorted
    other revolutionaries. The best thing, though, is that the little critters
    dance to the beat throughout the video.
    </p>
<p>
    So <em>A.R.C.</em> is a
    pretty great package, even if it feels somewhat randomly assembled. The audio
    portion is dynamite ultra-modern jazz, and the live footage captures a powerful
    band that hits on some genuinely transcendent moments from time to time.

    On the cover of David Bazan's <em>Fewer Moving Parts</em> EP, the
    singer-songwriter is rendered in a graphic novel-style illustration by
    Zak Sally, Low's former bass player. Bearded, axe slung over his
    shoulder, and foregrounding a clear-cut field of nubby stumps, Bazan
    appears, significantly, alone. This is, after all, his first release
    under his own name since retiring Pedro the Lion. Equally fitting-- and
    appropriately heavy handed-- for the EP's content is the lumberjack
    imagery of felled trees. On <em>Fewer Moving Parts</em>, Bazan takes swings at some easy targets and aims to cut them down to size.</p><p>
    The thing is, Bazan's once-sharp songwriting has dulled considerably since 1998's understated but utterly endearing <em>It's Hard to Find a Friend</em>.
    Whether humorously skewering standards of beauty (""winter legs give me
    heart attacks"") or nakedly hanging his bleeding heart out to dry on
    songs that addressed his Christian faith, Bazan's early work never
    buckled under the weight of its self-importance. It was just spare
    indie rock unafraid to admit to some serious heartache. But, after a
    few regrettable dalliances into concept records like <em>Winners Never Quit</em> and <em>Control</em>, Bazan eschewed any semblance of subtlety for clobbering listeners with a message. And in that department, <em>Fewer Moving Parts</em> leaves you pretty battered.</p><p>
    The opener, ""Selling Advertising"", is a snot-nosed swipe at record
    reviewers and anyone who works in the all-encompassing field of
    marketing. When Bazan drops phrases like ""tracking trends"" and
    ""corralling demographics,"" it's a critique as pat and depthless as
    you'd find in three frames of Dilbert. As he ribs reviewers for
    inevitably focusing on his Christian faith, Bazan wanders into some
    avoid-at-all-costs lyrical territory, singing, ""Am I a Christian? Are
    you a Jew?/ Did you kill my Lord? Must I forgive you?""
    </p>
<p>
    ""Backwoods Nation"", with its Neanderthal rock stops and starts, is
    similarly base in its criticism of the U.S. Bazan implores ""all
    rednecks"" to ""pick up machine guns and kill camel fuckers."" He also
    invites fratboys to swap their ""cocaine and casual date raping/ For
    cabinet appointments and rose garden tapings."" Bazan may be
    understandably incensed by the state of the nation, but this is some
    puerile fare. Even when Bazan turns his vitriol inward, as on ""Fewer
    Broken Pieces"", his self-deprecation is cloying. Sample lyric: ""David
    Byrne on Bob Costas put it pretty well/ But I put it better/ I still
    run the show/ Don't you forget it."" And while his tongue is planted
    firmly in his cheek, the joke is awfully thin.
    </p>
<p>
    Musically, <em>Fewer Moving Parts</em> doesn't represent much of a
    departure from his work as Pedro the Lion. As always, Bazan's melodies
    are better than average and his production tasteful. But none of this
    material sounds particularly inspired, which makes the decision to
    include an acoustic version of every song totally confounding. If the
    fully produced versions were more elaborate or truly different, the
    acoustic counterparts would make for an interesting glimpse into
    Bazan's creative process. But the skeletal compositions are so
    faithfully preserved in the fully produced versions that their
    inclusion is a real head-scratcher. Hopefully, Bazan is just hoarding
    his best material for his forthcoming full-length and <em>Fewer Moving Parts</em> is just a shaky first step into life after Pedro the Lion.

    As one half of the Postal Service, Jimmy Tamborello pulled off
    the improbable trick of getting Death Cab for Cutie fans to forget,
    momentarily, about guitars. Sure, Ben Gibbard played a few hooky leads
    and created a lyrical world where extravagant romance trumped
    rhetorical coherence at every turn. But indie kids could emotionally
    connect with Tamborello's chiseled melodic muscle, too. The burbling
    glitchcore he honed as Dntel-- where elegant polyrhythmic waves whooshed
    out into broad, open intervals-- found a wide audience that liked the
    idea of electronic music but was either aesthetically or ideologically
    repelled by what they perceived as its frigidness. This
    audience, like Tamborello himself, had little personal investment
    in electronic music's intricate matrix of stylistic variations, but
    heard in the Postal Service's overstated electro a recognizable
    emotional catharsis that squared with indie rock's definition of same.
    <div>
    On his new solo album, it's no accident that Tamborello uses his
    moniker from his electro-pop band Figurine-- it's emphatically not a
    Dntel record. This also alludes to its origins: While touring Germany
    with Figurine several years ago, Tamborello discovered minimalism by
    way of some Kompakt records, and decided to take a stab at it himself.
    The result of that learning experience is <em>Mistake Mistake Mistake Mistake</em>, an album of tepid and
    stylistically muddled techno. It's not as if he's forgotten his bread
    and butter: ""55566688833"", the album's first and most memorable track,
    reworks the Postal Service's springy opulence with Tamborello's own
    relaxed murmur replacing Gibbard's theatrics. It comes off like
    Casiotone for the Painfully Alone-- droll and charming. ""Leftovers""
    coasts on that good idea's fumes, working a wriggly,
    difference-splitting groove that's too hyper to lull and too rigid to
    swoon. 
    </div></p><p>
    From this point onward, lucidity disintegrates at a rapid clip, as
    Tamborello attempts to craft historically informed techno while
    recoiling from its unforgiving nudity, dressing it up in a variety of
    garish, mismatched costumes. He meanders through an array of house
    music offshoots, but seems primarily interested in the clicky,
    cut-n-paste concision of microhouse. Nuanced stasis proves a stretch
    for Tamborello's maximalist sensibility, and most of the tracks sound
    exactly like what they are: An apprentice's overwrought take on the
    stark, sublime depths of Isolée and Luomo, overloaded with guest vocals
    and concessions to hyperbole.
    <div>
    ""Ruining the Sundays"" heavy-hands bleating bass shapes and
    clip-art generic stuttering synths (which reappear on ""Apologies"")
    through interminable permutations. ""Pretend It's a Race and I'm on Your
    Side"" sounds like a hammy Dominic Eulberg outtake that keeps puttering
    long after its baroque whorls have exhausted their interest. ""You
    Again"" misplaces an inconsequential Jenny Lewis guest vocal amid a
    cartoonishly over-articulated squelch, while on ""All the Way to China"",
    Erlend Øye holds court amid a fluttering synth burner that
    frustratingly refuses to surge or settle, treading stagnant water.
    Despite these missteps, Tamborello is a sympathetic character-- forced
    to choose between continuing his intuitive exploration of digital tech
    or attempting to learn his gear's history under public scrutiny, he
    took the more courageous route. Nevertheless, the resultant album finds
    the talented producer cutting himself off at the knees, playing against
    every one of his strengths.

    Now
    more than ever, the Kicks' post-punk/garage cred hangs by a thread. Long the
    whipping boys of New York's revivalist clique, the dorky kids lumped
    in with the cool Walkmen/Strokes crowd, this foursome's only remaining link to the scene rests in its locale. Somewhere between debut <em>One Time Bells</em> and
    2004's <em>Trial of the Century</em>, they morphed into a pop-rock group, about
    as post-punk or garage as U2's last album. Fittingly, <em>Two Thousand</em>
    sounds like a wistful, tuckered-out, twilight-of-career album for a band that
    never saw much daylight.</p><p>
    In all fairness, this album tweaks its predecessor's zonked-out, adult
    alternative sound. Like the Walkmen's Hamilton
    Leithauser, French Kicks frontman Nick Stumpf often falls in love with his own croon,
    deflating songs and blowing potential melodies in the process. This time the
    Kicks pick up on one of the Walkmen's greatest tricks-- the use of pretty chord
    changes as hooks. ""Cloche"" shuffles along innocuously through a
    nondescript verse until waves of reverb-drenched guitar straight off of <em>Bows
    + Arrows</em> relieve Stumpf. ""Keep It Amazed"" inverts the formula,
    opening strong with catchy surf guitar only to lapse into an overly harmonized
    climax.</p><p>
    Save for these focused snippets, the band cuts every song from the
    same cloth; only the Kicks can represent New York as somnolent and homogenous.
    If not for the obligatory post-punk intros of skittish percussion and spiky guitar
    riffs demarcating them, these songs would seamlessly mesh one into another.
    Furthermore, Stumpf's on an emotional merry-go-round, his cadence fluctuating
    minimally before returning to the starting point. The drumbeat for
    ""Basement D.C."" matches that of Phoenix's ""One Time Too
    Many"", yet the vocals somehow manage to further soften that song's already
    soft-rock swagger, making Steely Dan sound like a bunch of coked-out
    psychopaths. 
    </p>
    For
    all the improved minutiae, French Kicks simply can't shed the ""boring""
    tag. Even now, with nearly every New York band under scrutiny in an anti-hype
    backlash, they can't even get (nor do they deserve) pity as underdogs,
    outsiders who did their own thing when Interpol, the Rapture and the Strokes
    cashed in. I don't want to hate here-- especially since the band commits no
    fatal errors-- but until these guys realize their potential, they'll keep
    sounding like 1,000 monkeys chained to 1,000 guitars in the middle of Brooklyn,
    each one riding a Vespa scooter.</div>"|9206.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9206-two-thousand/|6.0|Adam Moerder

    If Jim Noir thinks he's being ironic having a name that's dark and mysterious when his songs are fey and pop, he's clowning himself: Everyone knows the sunnier the pop, the scarier its demons. Luckily <em>Tower of Love</em> isn't too sweet, so logic follows that Noir can't be all that tortured. At worst he carries some acrid memories from childhood. On ""Eanie Meany”, one of many tracks that deploys a dizzy Kinks-ish wistfulness-- and a fixture in adidas' recent World Cup ad campaigns-- he remembers the cranky neighbors who ruined his afternoon: ""If you don't give my football back, I'm gonna get my dad on you."" Hearing the Manchester singer/songwriter tell it, his whispery voice hanging fog-like over straw hat strums and swishy synths, it's unclear whether he's genuinely nostalgic or just thankful the ball snatchers gave him some material.</p><p>
    What we know for sure is that Noir hasn't fully outgrown childhood, and he uses every opportunity to remind us. When, on ""Climb a Tree"", he asks, ""Do you remember when we had no cares?"" a valid response could be, ""What's to <em>remember</em>?""</p><p>
    If <em>Tower of Love</em> were an ecosystem, it would resemble California or someplace that doesn't have seasons. So forget subject matter for now-- the album is most childlike in this tonal uniformity. Noir wears (or his figural personage does anyway) the slightly stupefied, going-along-with-it smile you see on shy kids who are easily cowed. Constructed lack of complexity's the old hat schtick, Noir’s cuddly four-track pop just the chosen vehicle. ""Key of C"" works as a sort of mission statement: ""Oh, little C, I just want you to leave/ You make me so predictable,"" but nevertheless, ""I want to be in the key of C/ It's easier to play it."" </p><p>
    Let's just say <em>Tower of Love</em> isn't out to offend or challenge or discomfit anyone. But the album's less simplistic than it comes on, obviously, its snugly melodies decorated with snaking structures and surprising instrumentation. A vocal round, egged along by toy piano quarter notes, opens record-opener ""My Patch"". A minute later sound ceases, as if onward to the next track, but the song has only paused to perform a lineup change: Coach Noir subs out piano, clave, and synth bass for acoustic guitar, drums, real bass, and what sounds like a mandolin. “I Me You I’m Your” harmonizes water-shiny organ pulses with a drier, almost sine wave-smooth keyb line. The ensuing album-best chorus goes “I me you I’m yourrrrrrr” and solves <em>Tower of Love</em>’s problems without perhaps realizing it: Rather than trying to emphasize the naïvety of his naïve-sounding music with naïve content, Noir lets a shining melody do the work. He briefly grasps that in pop, more often than not, nonsense makes the most sense.  </p></div>"|9214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9214-tower-of-love/|7.2|Sam Ubl

    Plenty of rock-oriented bands have dabbled in dub and reggae, with results ranging from exceptional (Bad Brains, PiL) to questionable (the Clash) to risible (Sublime). While dub elements are by nature foundational, the structural bottom of any composition in which they appear, many dub-dabblers use it like window dressing to spruce up their rock. But for Dub Trio, the trajectory is reversed: Their first album, <em>Exploring the Dangers Of</em>, was a fairly unadulterated dub/reggae platter, while their second, <em>New Heavy</em>, is an experiment in splicing dub with post-hardcore metal and punk.</p><p>
    But ""splice,"" here, is misleading-- usually, in music criticism, it refers to a seamless hybridization. Dub Trio's <em>musicianship</em> is certainly seamless-- comprised of seasoned session musicians including the regular bass player for G-Unit, the drummer for the reunited Fugees, and a guitarist who's worked with Common and Mos Def, the group has chops to spare. But their music is profoundly Balkanized, spliced literally, in the manner of film, end to end. So in most songs we get a few meters of spacey dub, then a few of post-hardcore heshing, so pronounced in their segregation that there might as well be little reel change ovals flashing before each abrupt cut.</p><p>
    The dubs are credible and sufficiently deep, and the tracks on which they aren't interrupted with gnarly riffage are the best. ""Table Rock Dub"" is a barren expanse seething with detuned plinks and bowel-shaking rumbles. The compelling but brief ""Yes You Can't"" is an ominous dub plate with buzzy slabs of dangerous bass and bright bursts of percussive melody, slithering with a hitching squelch. ""Sunny I'm Kill"", with its trilling melodica and sprightly reggae lilt, is a standout, and the abstract watercolor washes of ""Lullaby For..."" close the album with a subtlety that's all the more refreshing for its close proximity to the decidedly unsubtle post-hardcore trappings that mar about half of the record. 
    </p>
<p>
    The pop-metal of ""Illegal Dub"" has tight dynamics but no surprises, dotting a harsh desert of dude rock with little oases of glassy pings and watery string delays. Guest vocalist Mike Patton gets preposterous on the bombastic ""Not Alone"", belting out absurdities like ""We're all alone/ In this psychodrome"" and ""Like a Starbucks chain/ We're taking over this neighborhood"" over lockstep bass and crunchy chords. ""Angle of Acceptance"" misplaces its echoing dubs amid a wince-inducing array of pre-Armani Metallica chugging and canned start/stop dynamics, and the tense reggae of ""Jack Bauer"" is poorly served by the cock-rock carnage surrounding it. 
    </p>
<p>
    If there's a track on the album that successfully blends dub and rock, it's ""Screaming at the Sea"", a Smashing Pumpkins-style string-bent anthem that morphs into a serpentine dub. With its less abrupt transitions and recourse to non-post-hardcore rock, the song speaks of Dub Trio's unrealized potential. For now, they're talented musicians welding durable dub onto tired post-hardcore with very mixed results. One wishes they'd either stuck to dub or found a less odious rock genre to experiment with, one that could blend more organically than post-hardcore's stampeding china-shop bull.

    With the demise of San Francisco's Coachwhips, frontman John Dwyer's former side project OCS has become his main gig. He's even rechristened the project the OhSees, possibly to commemorate the shift, possibly to avoid association with a certain television show set in Orange County. Regardless, Dwyer's shapeshifting aspirations are evident on <em>The Cool Death of Island Raiders</em>, his third release of acoustic folk. And though the music performed as OhSees is markedly different than that of his former band, they share an aesthetic. Coachwhips was grounded in rock and roll but relied on high-energy garage punk attributes, encasing each component in a layer of distortion. Similarly, the folk-pop of the OhSees is injected with off-kilter noise and drone that competes with-- and sometimes completely replaces-- the melodies.</p><p>
    I admire Dwyer's desire to change it up. It's not unusual for musicians used to playing loud and fast to branch out on their other projects, and it's always interesting to hear an artist use the same skill set with a different set of tools. But Dwyer's work here is a mess. He relies too heavily on the freak half of freak-folk, burying the songs in grating arrangements and murky production. The latter is especially confusing, since TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek produced. Sitek doesn't seem to have done much with the songs, but, then again, maybe he had too little to work with. The drums are often pushed low in the mix, with only the atonal clang of the cymbals cutting through the reverb-laden acoustic guitar, and Dwyer's high-pitched yelping is soaked in effects.</p><p>
    What's worse is that only a handful of songs have a memorable melody to begin with, and on those Dwyer's voice is too distracting, giving the songs an air of novelty. The album's opener, the unfortunately titled ""The Guilded Cunt"", is a cutesy, memorable tune, where Dwyer's vocals almost seem to fit. It feels like a silly intro to a more full-bodied album, but, alas, it's one of the disc's more fleshed-out tracks. Things go quickly downhill as ""The Dumb Drums"" falls into the album's predictable pattern of lethargic noise-for-noise's-sake. The album's two straight-up drone tracks (""Drone Number One"" and ""Drone Number Two"") are an oddly refreshing respite. Contrast these with ""Cool Deaths"", which builds from warped guitar strums and slides to a crescendo of contradictory melodies and rhythms. It's as if every time Dwyer senses a straightforward pop song trying to sneak out, he kills it with a sloppy attempt at atmosphere.

    beget real numbers. The most infamous examples are just that because they're
    neatly illustrative of how the net has swiftly undermined the machinations of
    the traditional system. The cases of Dizzee Rascal, Wilco, and the Arctic
    Monkeys alone serve as poetic reconsiderations of the practices of entire major
    label departments (A&amp;R, distribution, and marketing, respectively). The only

    For all its ubiquity, MySpace
    had yet to yield a definitive zero-to-hero prior to Allen, but with ""Smile"" landing
    at the #1 spot on the UK
    singles chart a few weeks back, that's neither here nor there anymore. Since
    Allen started uploading a mixture of radio-ready originals, nervy covers, and
    links to blognerd-ready mixtapes to her MySpace page late last year, the 21-year old's
    profile has grown wilder than a Malcolm Gladwell ringlet. To date, she's racked
    up 550,000 page views, a recording contract with Parlophone/EMI, and, like her

    But to say that <em>Alright,

    always a push/pull at the center, and the task of managing and reconciling all
    that on a personal level is a relatively new thing. It's just a hunch, but I
    think maybe one of the bonus reasons <em>Alright,
    Still</em> is compelling is because it inadvertently makes gestures to that
    whole phenomenon. It's a through-the-looking-glass trajectory that begins with
    a MySpacer who's got great tunes, good stories, and a funny way with
    commas, and it ends with a slickly produced pop album that isn't all that far apart
    from pretty much any other UK female pop singer in terms of packaging and
    presentation. Somewhere between those two points is truth, somewhere behind it
    all is real-life messiness, and I think people are enjoying figuring it out,
    not to mention having another familiar co-ordinate from which to put it all
    together.</p><p>
    None of which would mean much if <em>Alright, Still</em> wasn't fantastic. Fortunately, it's the kind of
    debut for which the cliché ""great summer album"" is happily perpetuated.
    Clocking in at just over 37 minutes and boasting no fewer than seven potential
    singles, it's an album made at the intersection of whipsmart British pop like
    Saint Etienne, the Specials and-– inevitably, given that both write
    colloquially about things like waiting in club queues and getting stoned–- the
    Streets. Although she's been beseiged by comparisons to the latter, it's a fair
    one. Allen might not rap, but she shares Mike Skinner's easy
    comfort with language; she's confident enough that she never overexerts
    herself lyrically, but she's not above risking a stupid joke either (witness ""Shame for You""s wilting punchline, ""Oh my God you must be joking me/ If you think
    that you'll be poking me""). A significant portion of <em>Alright, Still</em> is dedicated to verbal takedowns, with ex-boyfriends
    getting the brunt of the abuse, while would-be suitors
    and dumb girls trail
    behind at a distant two and three; in the wrong hands, it could all seem so petulant
    and bratty, but Allen's wit and cynicism sees it through.</p><p>
    Musically, ska, reggae, and calypso are her major
    touchpoints. From the dub-inflected kiss-off track ""Not Big"" to the skanking
    ""Friend of Mine"", there's not a lot here that doesn't use a horn sample or a
    guitar chug as its launching off point. As evidenced by the poison-penned
    ""Smile"" and the MySpace hit ""LDN"", Allen's appeal is in the way she combines
    those spacious, rolling sounds with A+ pop structures. When she operates
    outside of that comfort zone, the results are generally still of a high order,
    if not a bit more erratic. ""Littlest Things"" is a supple piano-tickler that
    provides one of Allen's sweetest lyrical moments while simultaneously leaving Ms.
    Dynamite in the dust on the R&amp;B balladeering front, while ""Everything's
    Just Wonderful"" is the exuberant bit of cocktail pop that Geri Halliwell
    unsuccessfully spent her entire solo career trying to procure. Less favorably, the
    Madchester-flavored anthem-by-numbers ""Take What You Take"" reveals what Allen
    might sound like if she ever decided to make a run for the title of Britain's
    female Robbie Williams. (Perhaps not coincidentally, it's also the source of
    her weakest lyric.)</p><p>
    It's a shame that sample clearance issues likely prevented two of Allen's wickedest moments, the 50 Cent homage and Grandma Allen diss track ""Nan, You're a Window Shopper"" and the Origin Unknown-sampling ""Cheryl Tweedy"", from appearing here. Nonetheless, in terms of a debut record-- and especially given
    the weight of expectation placed on her to deliver something special-- <em>Alright, Still</em> isn't anything else but a
    fantastic success. Not only does Allen deliver on the musical promise hinted at
    in her MySpace demos, she also acquits herself as a genuine personality with
    wit and attitude to spare. But don't take it from me. You know how to Google-- she always was her own best PR person anyway.</p></div>"|9221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9221-alright-still/|8.3|Mark Pytlik

    The crew at London's highly-esteemed Rough Trade record shops have spent the past few years moonlighting as pop cultural archivists, releasing compilations that have ambitiously documented various genres like post-punk, electronica, country, and indie pop. So in a sense their latest collection <em>Rough Trade Shops:</em> <em>Singer-Songwriter 01</em> seems to be just a tidy bit of housekeeping, gathering tracks from those stray artists-- Cat Power, Antony and the Johnsons, Mountain Goats-- whose work hasn't fit precisely into any one specific genre. Containing a whopping 39 tracks on its two discs, the set would also appear to be a perfect opportunity for Rough Trade to reflect the ever-shifting possibilities of songwriting, particularly at a time when recording technology can easily blur the distinction between songwriting and production, arranging and/or improvisation.</p><p>
    Despite appearances by such iconoclastic performers as Tom Waits, PJ Harvey, and Nick Cave, however, listening to <em>Singer-Songwriter 01</em> can be a shockingly tiresome affair. Displaying an uncharacteristic degree of caution, Rough Trade's curators have employed a definition of the term ""singer-songwriter"" that's conservative enough to mollify even the most timid radio programmer. The performers assembled here are uniformly white, English-speaking, and roughly 75% male. In nearly every case, each singer is accompanied only by a solo guitar or piano, or else by a small, unobtrusive backing group. Moreover, few of these performers betray any interest whatsoever in testing the boundaries of their songcraft, as virtually every track falls back upon standard-issue folk/country/rock-based construction. As a result, Rough Trade have taken what might have been their most far-reaching, instructive collection and instead made it their most rigid and monotonous.</p><p>
    Yet whatever disagreement one might have with Rough Trade's selection process, there is no denying that <em>Singer-Songwriter 01 </em>contains several masterful performances. (And no doubt clearing some pesky licensing hurdles in the process.) Near-essential tracks like Elliott Smith's harrowing ""Needle in the Hay"" or Daniel Johnston's ubiquitous ""Speeding Motorcycle"" mix nicely with underrated sleepers like Barbara Manning's ""Scissors"" and Adrian Crowley's gorgeous ""The Girl From the Estuary"". A typically arresting demo version of PJ Harvey's ""Dress"" is one of the set's relative rarities, while Tom Waits' jazzy ""Little Boy Blue"" is taken from his little-heralded soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's <em>One From the Heart</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    The collection also showcases underappreciated British eccentrics such as Robert Wyatt, Richard Thompson, and Bevis Frond's Nick Saloman. Wyatt's ""Blues in Bob Minor"" is a bizarre re-write of Dylan's ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" that provides the album with a much-needed dose of humor. And though tracks like Thompson's story-boarded ""1952 Vincent Black Lightning"" and Saloman's exquisite ""Waving"" draw from their creators' more traditionalist sides, both tracks do provide an ample indication of each musician's prodigious versatility and imagination. 
    </p>
<p>
    It should go without saying that most multi-artist compilations are inconsistent by their very nature, but <em>Singer-Songwriter 01</em> becomes bogged down in its second act by its ear-numbing consistency. Lukewarm tracks by performers like Mark Mulcahy, Matthew Hattie Hein, Charlie Parr, Jeffrey Lewis, and King Creosote file past anonymously. Amidst this uninspiring crowd, distinctive vocalists like Vic Chesnutt and Antony Hegarty tower like giants, and even such quirky, acquired-taste artists as Victoria Williams and Diane Cluck can here seem like a burst of clean oxygen injected into a stale, smoke-filled coffeehouse. 
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps most surprising and dismaying of all, however, is the collection's noticeable shortage of memorable lyrics. The presence of such noted wordsmiths as Waits and Cave notwithstanding, many of these songs make their entrance and exit without leaving behind any snappy quotables or any particularly vital thematic impressions. Text-centric tracks from verbose songwriters Franklin Bruno and Simon Joyner do their best to balance quantity with quality, but only Conor Oberst, on Bright Eyes' unhinged ""The Calendar Hung Itself"" attempts to match his frenetic word-stream with an equally dynamic instrumental backdrop. 
    </p>
<p>
    Ultimately, though, the compilation's general lack of inventive wordplay only serves to underscore the restrictive nature of Rough Trade's song selection. Even if one is to accept the dubious premise that all hip-hop is automatically disqualified from consideration, since its vocalists are technically rappers instead of singers, it's not difficult to think of countless international singer-songwriters-- working the further reaches of electronica, avant-folk, samba, electro-pop, experimental noise-rock, etc.-- whose inclusion here would've made this compilation much more comprehensive and considerably more fun to listen to.

    Barry Adamson doesn't shy away from melodrama on <em>Stranger
    on the Sofa</em>, his ninth solo album. ""Here in the Hole"" is the kind
    of spoken-word narrative you either embrace or laugh at-- there's no
    in-between. Over bursts of static and gyroscoping feedback that flits in and
    out of view like a searchlight pointed skyward, Anna Chancellor's brittle
    upper-crust English accent intones a weird sci-fi narrative stuffed with lines
    like ""They believe I know everything because my master's memory serves me
    well/ In fact, I know nothing"" and ""I operate a program of
    self-denial, yet languish in polymorphous perversity as is my wont"" and
    ""I'm hunted for my flesh/ I'm hounded for my beauty.""</p><p>
    ""Here in the Hole"" shares some sonic
    characteristics with Adamson's early soundtrack-influenced work, and its
    placement at the front of the album feels like a pullback from the odd funk of
    2002's <em>King of Nothing Hill</em>, but it turns out the rest of the album is
    all over the place, swinging through dark pop, atmospheric instrumentals, and demented
    circus music. The next song, ""The Long Way Back Again"", is like <em>Barry
    Adamson's Basement Tapes</em>, catchy pop spilling over with Hammond organ and
    acoustic strumming, not to mention slide guitar and a big harmonica hook. It's
    not in Adamson's usual territory, but it's a killer song.</p><p>
    In addition to bass (which he played with Magazine and Nick
    Cave), Adamson plays most of the instruments here, including sax, drums, and
    vibes. Occasional organ and slide guitar-- from Nick Plytas and Adrian Owusu,
    respectively-- add a lot to the record, suggesting Adamson was wise to hand
    those bits off to specialists. Broken waltz ""Inside of Your Head""
    would be a lesser song without its swirling Hammond part, for instance, while
    Owusu's guitar adds whole layers to ""You Sold Your Dreams"" and
    ""Officer Bentley's Fairly Serious Dilemma"", both memorable rock
    songs. ""Officer Bentley"" uses its beginnings as solid pop as a launch
    point for a wild Rollerskate Skinny-ish jam, cut with samples of EMS personnel
    describing patient symptoms.
    </p>
<p>
    The scattershot nature of the album works in its favor and
    tends to mirror the way Adamson's mind works; what to many would seem a strange
    juxtaposition just seems natural for him, as he freely mixes deadpan
    seriousness with bizarre humor. ""My Friend the Fly"" is the best
    example: Adamson's sinister monologue in the verses involves lyrics about
    injuring himself while trying to swat a fly and could just as easily have been
    sung by Homer &amp; Jethro or a Marx brother. And then the charging instrumental
    passages the verses trade off with are Adamson's signature cinematic soul, as
    is the gorgeous instrumental ""The Sorrow &amp; the Pity"", which goes
    from martial drums to beautiful string synths and piano.
    </p>
<p>
    The album ends with a couple of instrumentals that
    showcase Adamson's funk and dub leanings, both of which are good but not great.
    That the least interesting material falls to the back is unfortunate, because
    most of the album is engaging. Adamson is not a compromiser, and puts whatever
    he wants to into his songs; while this approach isn't always successful, it
    yields unique music with great personality, and <em>Stranger on the Sofa</em> has
    plenty of both.

    Tadd
    Mullinix (aka Dabrye) is a multi-monikered, hip-hop-hungry, electro-leaning
    music producer. You know, like Scott Herren (aka Prefuse 73). But since Prefuse
    crashed hard with the guest-ridden debacle <em>Surrounded By Silence</em> last
    year, there's now room for a ""next Prefuse,"" whether anybody wants
    one or not. When I saw Dabrye open for Prefuse back in 2003, most of his solo
    set was low-key and passable. Then, near the end, he started to lace his
    synth-heavy, moon-boot beats with bits and pieces of sampled raps, at which
    point the crowd went nuts (relatively), nodding their heads with a measured
    amount of intensity. Now, Dabrye is running with that energy, following up his
    two nice enough instrumental albums with <em>Two/Three</em>, which-- like <em>Surrounded</em>--
    features many real-life hip-hop vocalists. And-- like <em>Surrounded</em>-- the
    outcome isn't nearly as ecstatic as one would hope.</p><p>
    The producer's singular Timbaland-meets-the flipside of <em>Low</em> rumble is
    more focused and intricate than ever, but his underground MC guests continually
    falter with convoluted rhymes that rust up Dabrye's menacing robot bounce. At
    the jump, when Lootpack alum Wildchild proclaims ""It's time to take a
    stand...speak for those who don't have a chance to speak,"" he's ostensibly
    talking about (to?) the ""youth,"" but his anti-flow quickly turns into
    a blithering mess when coupled with Dabrye's tricky undulations. Then there's
    Kadence, who spends 96 percent of his waking life practicing the ""furrowed
    brow"" in the mirror while reading <em>No Logo</em> and taking notes. Those
    notes eventually turn into raps like: ""I'm gonna keep spittin' this shit
    until people internalize it/ It's all a matter of what you subjectively
    circumscribe to/ Envisioned through designer sunglasses you hide behind at
    night/ Signifier of a colonized mind."" Signifier of a <em>polite</em> mind
    that's trying to hide closed eyes is more like it (i.e., dude is an instant
    drowzer). ""Can a rapper be socio-philosophical and still affect y'all, is
    it possible?"" he whines on ""Encoded Flow"", as if it's our fault
    he's not Chuck D. And then Beans, who is contractually obligated to appear on
    every indie-rap producer's ""MC"" record through 2017, shows up and
    does his little non-sequitur tinkle, purposely missing the bowl and thinking it's really cool. It's not.</p><p>
    Hope comes from the unexpected talents of Detroit's Guilty Simpson, a
    favorite of the late Jay Dee. Simpson
    isn't a prodigy and his verses are being graded on a curve against the rest of
    album's bullshit bunch, but still, there's a sense of release when he bounds
    onto ""Special"" with a sly gangster lean: ""I'm tired of being
    humble/ From here on out I'm brash/ Hot dog with extra flash."" As Dabrye's
    creepy crawler bass bubbles and scatters, the MC shows what <em>Two/Three</em>
    could be if the rappers were chosen based on entertainment value rather than
    how hard they're trying to save rap with big words. There's a natural cohesion
    between the producer's wicked slithers and brutish barbs like ""You ever
    seen a hundred crooks on the grind that'll put it through your window when you
    look through your blinds?"" Here's hoping Simpson and Dabrye get to hook up again
    in the future. 
    </p>
    The
    record's last track, ""Game Over"", is another reason to believe in
    Dabrye's futuristic vision. The rhymes from Motown heavies Jay Dee and Phat Kat
    are generally inane (""Who keeps the fuse lit?/ New shit!"") but the
    hometown bully vibe-- and the track's Dilla-inspired sparse drag-- is
    appealing. The beat, a grittier twist of Dabrye's own ""This Is Where I
    Came In"" from 2002's <em>Instrmntl</em>, could be the mind-tweaker's finest
    hip-hop moment yet, with Martian pulses, sinister chords and pitch-bending
    cartoon noises morphing into something funky and vicious. If he can stay away
    from wordy know-it-alls hell-bent on disrupting his groove, Dabrye has the potential
    to make an album as gripping as Prefuse's <em>One Word Extinguisher</em>.
    As for now, all we can do is wait on an instrumental version of <em>Two/Three</em>...and
    an enterprising fan to mash it with rhymes worthy of its diabolical creep.</div>"|9203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9203-twothree/|5.2|Ryan Dombal

    Straddling mid-1960s bubblegum and mid-80s feedback, the Legends' 2004 debut, <em>Up Against the Legends</em>, was full of shimmery pop and surprisingly inventive melodies that resolved themselves in unexpected ways. On their follow-up, <em>Public Radio</em>, head Legend Johan Angeråld rips it up and starts again, skipping ahead 15 or so years, landing squarely in post-punk. The desire for change is understandable-- pigeonholing is a threat to any band that could be identified by an entire decade. And besides, this move from pre- to post-punk mirrors a larger shift away from the 60s (the garage rock boom of a few years back) to the early 80s (the Bravery/Killers/Razorlight/ad nauseum movement of the moment).</p><p>
    The Legends get the sound right, that's for sure. With an ear toward dry historical recreation, they replicate the gauzy production values, those watery Cure guitar effects, the vocals that invade your personal space, and the simple drum machine programmed to strike on the second and fourth beats-- all down to a tee. Never mind, though, that there's at least one band, maybe even two, on every street corner aping this exact sound. Never mind too that the album sounds like the efforts of a lone man sitting in a sterile studio rather than the collaborative effort between several musicians. The real problem on <em>Public Radio</em> is that this academic exercise obscures the band's considerable strengths while highlighting its weaknesses.</p><p>
    In this hermetic setting, Angeråld's airy vocals sound devoid of character or identity, and his songwriting suffers dramatically. There's not a memorable hook or an intriguing melody on any of these dozen songs-- 20 if you count the bonus disc of remixes and bonuses that accompanies the first 1,000 copies. The songs follow predictable paths, preempting any sort of surprise, and are so loosely constructed and unmoored from the music that they seem to dissipate and slip from memory even as you hear and process them. For songwriting the Legends substitute a vaguely moody pallor, especially on the opener ""Today"" and ""Hide Away"", but the atmosphere feels sterile, as if it's been created and contained within a cleanroom. You can't dance to a control group, even if it's been remixed<em>.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Public Radio</em> peaks very briefly in the middle, when the Legends graft 60s elements-- bright choruses, handclaps, sunny harmonies-- onto Angeråld's filtered guitars and Atari keyboards. But instead of mutating into some weird and wonderful hybrid of 60s and 80s pop-- we'll call it the 70s-- songs like ""He Knows the Sun"", ""Something Good"", and ""Heaven Will Wait"" still sound pretty awkward and unstable, their elements never mixing and combining. Worse, the songs suggest a more satisfying experiment that the band doesn't pursue. As soon as ""Heaven Will Wait"" ends, it's back to the predictable sturm-und-drang of ""I Want to Be Like Everyone Else"", with its dull vocals and ominous piano chords signifying not much of anything.
    </p>
<p>
    Don't get me wrong: I'm not grading the Legends down for abandoning the 60s, or even for failing to devise a workable concoction of two genres, but rather for diluting all the qualities they exhibited on <em>Up Against</em> for what sounds like a stab at timeliness. The wit, creativity, and exuberance that put their debut in constant rotation at my house are entirely missing on <em>Public Radio</em>. In fact, the only thing that seems to link these two albums-- besides the band name-- is the odd secrecy which the Legends seem to insist on. The packaging is all white, with only a sticker on the cover to identify artist and title; on the back and spines, the tracklist is indistinguishable from the catalogue information. Such mystery was strangely compelling on <em>Up Against</em>, but on <em>Public Radio</em>, it's merely frustrating that the music is just as anonymous as the musicians.

    The element of surprise is gone from the mash-up. Hollertronix and 2 Many DJs mastered the technique, made it a staple of their sets, and next, everyone on the block was mix-matching hip-hop to electro and indie rock.  The idea that two songs blender-ized can recombine to create something wholly new is thrilling in theory, but the execution is usually sloppy or samey, either simply aligning two similar beat structures or pairing up two completely disparate tracks for the slapstick  novelty of a jokey title.</p><p>
    Pittsburgh native Greg Gillis (Girl Talk) absolutely detonates the notions of mash-up on his third album, the violently joyous <em>Night Ripper</em>.  Rather than squeeze two songs that sorta make sense together into a small box, Gillis crams six or eight or 14 or 20 songs into frenetic rows, slicing fragments off 1980s pop, Dirty South rap, booty bass, and grunge, among countless other genres. Then he pieces together the voracious music fan's dream: a hulking hyper-mix designed to make you dance, wear out predictable ideas, and defy hopeless record-reviewing.</p><p>
<em>
    Night Ripper</em> doesn't stretch the boundaries of mash-ups because there were no boundaries to begin with. As an illegal art form, it's surprising no one came along with an idea like this sooner. Still, it's doubtful they'd have the sturdy, meticulous hand that Gillis flaunts here. The record's pacing is astonishing-- with more than 150 sample sources (all thanked in the liner notes), it ricochets from Top 40 hits to obscure gems and back again like a cool breeze, clocking in at less than 42 minutes. The sampling is pure precision, slotting razor-thin (but highly recognizable) guitar stabs on top of blaring synths on top of anthemic rap couplets and so on, all at breakneck speed. 
    </p>
<p>
    Part of the fun of listening is trying to figure out the source of each fragment used on these tracks. Familiar as they may be, you'll never place every sample. But at the risk of getting sucked into Gillis' name-game vortex, an example speaks to the power. ""Smash Your Head"" glides into the siren keyboards of Lil Wayne's ""Fireman"" less than a minute in, then abruptly shifts into the crushingly dense riffs of Nirvana's ""Scentless Apprentice"" while Young Jeezy spits the familiar flames of ""Soul Survivor"", before it all tumbles into a Pharcyde-Elton John-Biggie somersault. On ""Minute by Minute"", Gillis even slots Neutral Milk Hotel's ""Holland, 1945"" up next to Juelz Santana's ""There It Go (The Whisper Song)"". There are no ties, other than the miracle of chopping and looping. 
    </p>
<p>
    Due to its overwhelming number of unlicensed sources, <em>Night Ripper</em> is practically begging for court drama. In the event of litigation, Gillis' label has armed themselves with a Fair Use argument, citing artists' rights to liberally sample in the creation of new works. Whether that'll hold any water in a courtroom remains to be seen, but for listeners it's an afterthought.  Some may dock him points for lack of originality, but Gillis' schizophrenic attitude toward pop music is so novel it's impossible to stay mad at. Time will tell whether it's still fresh in 12 months, when the very recent samples (M.I.A., Gwen Stefani, Webbie) lose their chic appeal next to Smokey Robinson, the Pixies, and Public Enemy-- but for 2006, <em>Night Ripper</em> is the soundtrack of the summer.

    I'll just start by saying I prefer Shapes and
    Sizes' lead female singer, Caila
    Thompson-Hannant, to their lead male singer, Rory Seydel. When the Asthmatic Kitty band's debut starts, you hear Seydel, who has the dissolute, whiny,
    post-Pavement voice of your average scrawny indie boy. The song doesn't
    get going until Thompson-Hannant comes in at 2:23, but when she does,
    it's a grabber: the drums take up a heavy beat while the guitar resorts
    to a squiggly thing behind Thompson-Hannant's tall, brazen voice. She

    your take-out order, and bellowing like she's never lowered her eyes in a
    fight or used nuance in place of honesty. ""I love eating fruit
    off of trees/ When I'm with you,"" she proclaims, reaching for high notes
    and shaking them in her fist, and when the other voices start chanting
    in time, it all sounds like the work of a cleaned-up no wave band.</p><p>
    That's two different ideas in just the first track-- the rest of Shapes and Sizes' debut album goes in more directions than it has songs to hold
    them. For several cuts, jittery chamber pop pours out behind
    Thompson-Hannant's swoops and the kitchen sink arrangements of horns
    and ukelele. But other times, the frenzy bleeds into the songs that
    demand more gravity: Her showcase ballad, ""Northern Lights"", has a few
    too many overdramatic thrusts and warbles, making it feel showy when
    she could have sung it straight. Closer ""Boy, You Shouldn't Have""
    is pitched as a rootsy country number, but they don't sell the grit.
    And the only straight-up indie rock song, ""Oh No, Oh Boy"",
    strikes me as dull-- it's just too damn conventional on an album that's
    trying to be all things to anyone who'll listen.</p><p>
    Also, ""Oh No, Oh Boy"" features Seydel, and he just can't keep
    up. Granted, he shows subtlety and precision underneath his emoting. But plenty of whiny indie rock guys can do what he
    does; we need more Thompson-Hannants. On ""Rory's Bleeding""-- their most
    clever-for-the-sake-of-cleverness song-- Seydel
    's lying injured, and Thompson-Hannant coos that he was ""caught in the
    crossfire, an innocent young man."" I'd like to think she's calling him
    out as an ""innocent"" to remind us that she could use the guy's head to
    open beer bottles. 
    </p>
<p>
    But honestly, Thompson-Hannant's as responsible as anyone for the
    record's swings into allegedly charming immaturity-- like on
    ""Wilderness"", where the band acts like fairy children flitting through
    the woods, fighting over who gets to be ""tribal leader."" It's whimsical
    and it works on its own terms, but that whimsy definitely undercuts the
    psychodrama and self-damnation that follow it. Sure, on ""Goldenhead""
    and ""Topsy Turvey"" Thompson-Hannant sounds desparate and overwhelmed,
    but hey-- maybe it's just a phase. 
    </p>
<p>
    This debut record takes a lot of chances, and to some degree, what
    works depends on who's listening. Shapes and Sizes are already making
    the rounds of the mp3 blogs, and that makes sense: Everybody can post
    the side of the band they like best. But next time, they should firm it
    up and rein it in. Their ""try anything once"" attitude is often very
    cute. But how much more ""cute"" do we need?

    From discussions with friends I gather that music obsessives tend to think differently once they start having babies. A wall of CDs apparently begins to seem pretty insignificant when your child is playing next to them on the floor. Maybe they're even a safety hazard. They start to wonder: Is that thing bolted to the wall?</p><p>
    But beyond the physical objects, new parents begin to hear music through the ears of their kids. And questions come up. What sort of music will my baby like? Will playing Mozart really make her smarter? Do I really have to learn to enjoy the Wiggles?</p><p>
    You take this thing you care about (music) and try to figure out how it fits into this new life (parenthood). A couple years back Montreal's Marc Leclair, whom most of us know through the sample-crazed microhouse he's made as Akufen, applied his skill with his sampler and electronics to the concept of pregnancy. His wife and two close friends all became pregnant around the same time, and Leclair began work on what was to become <em>Musique Pour 3 Femmes Enceintes </em>(""Music for 3 Pregnant Women""). A 71-minute concept album, it tracks the progression of a fetus in the womb, measuring the term with track titles like ""64e Jour"" (64<sup>th</sup> day). After a low-key release in 2005, it's now been reissued here in the States.
    </p>
<p>
    We expect certain qualities from a concept record about this subject-- something warm, enveloping, aquatic-- and Leclair delivers. The early part of the record, from around the opening ""1er Jour"" (a collaboration with German minimalists Rechenzentrum) though ""85e Jour"", is infused with viscous pop ambient drift, the gauzy synth pads ebbing and flowing with rhythm (but not beats), cut here and there with Leclair's needly electronic glitches. It follows that this part of the record would be more shapeless and fluid, when cells are just starting to assemble themselves into something we recognize as human. And Leclair is good at this sort of vaporous ambient wash. Lost in the discussion of Akufen, which focused so intently on cut-up samples, was Leclair's skill in crafting effective sound from scratch.
    </p>
<p>
    The record turns at ""114e Jour"", when guitar fragments and the sound of a storm first appear. As the ringing acoustic tones fold in Leclair adds the first bass-driven beat and hard dubby pans of echoing synth across the spectrum. Guitar is featured prominently through the rest of the record to terrific effect, connecting somehow the abstract and internal world of electronics with the messy, organic and open-ended reality of life ""outside.""
    </p>
<p>
    The following ""150e Jour"" is an unfailingly gorgeous and tightly sequenced quilt of guitar and piano samples reminiscent of Tangerine Dream, and it's here where the concept of the record really comes together. I hear a suitably complex mix of feelings and sensation. There's no small amount of fear in the insistent repetition, but it's cut with danceable beats that suggest joy. It's a track that just seems to be <em>happening</em> rather than within anyone's control, a quality amplified when the deep 4/4 bass drum enters around the six-minute mark.
    </p>
<p>
    The beats are more prominent from that point forward, and for my money they're far more engaging than the finely chopped radio cut-ups of Akufen's <em>My Way</em>. By ""236e Jour"" the record is really moving, coasting on a crisp house beat and surprisingly physical synths that seem to tear in half and reassemble with each bar. There is no sound to correspond with the ""274e jour"" listed on the record's sleeve. By that time, we surmise, the baby is out in the world and it's time to figure out what comes next. Raymond Scott, maybe? In any case, Leclair has created an excellent and varied record that sounds really good in a single go straight through.

    And you thought you had an impressive record collection. Richard Thompson's vinyl goes all the way back to the 13th century. He pulls out some really old tunes for <em>1,000 Years of Popular Music</em>, a live 2xCD/DVD set that documents a 2005 show with musicians Judith Owen and Debra Dobkin. The idea, as Thompson recounts in the liners, was inspired by a request from <em>Playboy</em> to list his favorite songs of the millennium; the magazine declined to print his list, but he was so enamored of the idea that he put together a small backing band and performed them all in rough chronological order. Aside from some minor quibbles-- apparently, music was never popular in Asia, Africa, or South America-- the set is mostly fun and light. It's a minor work in the Thompson canon, but enjoyable nevertheless-- if only for its tongue-in-cheek ambition and the singer's spirited delivery.</p><p>
<em>1,000 Years of Popular Music</em> kicks off with ""Summer Is Icumen In"", which is the original summer anthem and could be heard blasting from many a tavern and castle during the balmy middle months of 1260. The first disc takes us all the way up to 1940, covering the dark ages of pop music and leading us right up to the 20th century renaissance. Thompson's cover of ""Remember O Thou Man"" (1611) shows why so many villagers would raise up their torches for this show closer, and ""Java Jive"" (1940) shuffles along on a percolating rhythm as he toasts the original power drink. But ""O Sleep Fond Fancy"" (1590) is just such an obvious choice.</p><p>
    The latter half of the 20th century takes up the second disc, stretching from Cole Porter's ""Night and Day"", sung here by Owen, to the present. Thompson dips into American country with Hank Cochran's ""A-11"" (1963) and into British pop music with the Kinks' ""See My Friends"" (1965) and Squeeze's ""Tempted"" (1981), although Thompson and Owen ride the outro for way too long. Best of all is their rollicking version of the Easybeats' ""Friday on My Mind"" (1966)-- but really, who could mess that song up? The only real dud is the encore, ""Sam Hall"" (1830s), which is a fine song but doesn't really benefit from Thompson's gruff delivery or the half-hearted audience participation. 
    </p>
<p>
    On the whole, however, it's an entertaining game to pick out the similarities between these disparate tunes. How straight the lines are between ""King Henry"" (1400s) and ""Tempted"", between ""Bonnie St. Johnstone"" (1600s) and ""Cry Me a River"" (the 1953 Julie London hit, not the 2002 Justin Timberlake dis). His notorious cover of ""Oops... I Did It Again"" (2000) susses out the implications of the lyrics' casual manipulation, making it fit surprisingly well into Thompson's canon. But the biggest surprise on <em>1,000 Years of Popular Music</em> is how well Bowling for Soup holds up against centuries of popular music: Delivered by Thompson, their song ""1985"" (2004) provides an oddly insightful look at trends and nostalgia for our personal and collective past. Look for a big revival in 3006.

    Over the course of its recent boom, the Montreal music
    scene has become largely known for southwardly exporting music of an epic
    nature: the endless crescendos of Godspeed You Black Emperor!, the choral
    firepower of The Arcade Fire, the readymade anthems of Wolf Parade. Yet the
    underground to <em>this</em> underground is filled with bands decidedly less
    grandiose in their intentions: spastic pop purveyors like The Unicorns (and,
    subsequently, Islands) or crass-clowns like AIDS Wolf. As a category, these
    groups are less uniquely Quebecois, easily lumpable into a wider Can-American
    trend of indie party bands that pair lo-fi art student aspirations with
    costumed live shows that deliberately descend into drunken mayhem.</p><p class=""Pitchforkedit0"">
    With their notebook-doodle artwork and hee-haw pseudonyms,
    Think About Life appear, on the surface, easily pigeonholed into this movement,
    doomed to a life of basement shows and being the wacky opening act. But perhaps
    sharing a city with the stately, dead-serious bands that have made Montreal
    scene-profile-worthy has had an osmotic effect on the trio, allowing the
    occasional glimpse of intriguing musical texture to sneak in between the
    synthesizer romps and hyperactive vocals.</p><p class=""Pitchforkedit0"">
    Think About Life love the sound of a long, loud
    keyboard drone-- many of these synth parts are about as active as a cat falling
    asleep on the Moog. When paired with frenetic mixtures of live and looped
    percussion or frosted with additional keyboard squiggles, as on opener
    ""Paul Cries"" or the hi-hat crazy ""Serious Chords"", the held
    tones add surprising depth and volume to the band's slapdash style and sparse
    instrumentation. In other places, like ""Fireworks"" or the
    interminable ""Money"", the sound can be an irritant, and slow church
    organ arpeggios and routine drumming fail to take the edge off abrasively bad
    horn solos and microphone abuse. 
    </p>
<p class=""Pitchforkedit0"">
    Those vocals are frequently the fifth column of Think
    About Life's attempts to build a unique pop sound, too eagerly descending into
    goofy falsetto shrieks or bellowing off-key WOAH-OH-OH backing parts. These
    leanings toward full-band participation likely work better in their hyper-energetic live show, but on record the constant clowning clumsily
    sabotages moments of potential prettiness, like the pocket-<em>Loveless</em> peak
    at the end of ""Fireworks"". The album's dalliance with hip-hop
    (""What the Future Might Be"", with Los Angeles MC Subtitle) corrects
    these vocal shortcomings somewhat, but culminates in a cheesed-up chorus that
    steers the song towards Linkin Park territory. 
    </p>
<p class=""Pitchforkedit0"">
    I'm certainly not so joyless as to advocate that all
    music should be austere and epic-minded, but the partying priorities of Think
    About Life undercut their debut album. The elements presumably
    critical to their rock-the-house live performances-- the giddy vocals, the
    toybox instruments-- are little more than obfuscations in a recorded setting,
    disguising some real musical talent lurking beneath the goofy exterior, maybe
    even a Canadian TV on the Radio waiting to get out. For all I know, Think About
    Life's inability to remain serious may be a refreshing breath of fresh air
    amongst their visionary citymates, but catching a little more of their
    contagious pomposity would sharpen their approach.

    Frog Eyes has cultivated an instantly identifiable sound-- nearly every song in its repertoire contains singer/guitarist Carey Mercer's reverb-soaked guitar and raving vocals, drummer Melanie Campbell's typewriter rhythms, and spooky keyboards courtesy of either Spencer Krug or Grayson Miniely. But those elements have been pieced together in endless, often contradictory, permutations. To illustrate, 2004's <em>The Folded Palm</em> found Mercer crafting dense, compressed compositions that seemed to burn up as soon as they topped the one-minute mark. In contrast, the band's recent live sets have flaunted some incendiary new material, such as ""Bushels"" and ""Caravan Breakers"", that dynamically shifts between sections and stretches to epic lengths. In other words, it's Mercer's inventive approach to the formal structuring of his songs that keeps the band from falling into a well-worn groove.</p><p>
    With <em>The Future Is Inter-Disciplinary or Not at All </em>EP, Mercer and co. have found yet another way to toy with song structure, even undoing the very mechanics of songwriting as we know it. In a scant 17 minutes, eight fragmentary tracks segue into one another, creating a single piece of music. At times, the transitions are disruptive and abrupt; at others, the seams are so concealed that the division between two tracks seems arbitrary. As such, the eight tracks hardly function like songs. In terms of production quality, they're akin to the lo-fi and atmospheric home recordings on <em>Ego Scriptor</em> and the <em>Emboldened Navigator</em> 7"". But unlike the material on those two releases, the songs on <em>The Future</em> are closer to segments that work toward climactic turns, only to fizzle out or be swallowed by the following track.</p><p>
    Most interesting-- and frustrating for many fans of Frog Eyes-- is that the tracks often forego an emphasis on melody to communicate their emotional tenor. Instead, they move forward in a linear fashion, introducing new sonic elements and gaining volume as they progress. As it is, it's a twisted approximation of how more conventional songwriting operates. ""Really the End of Time?"", for example, begins with Mercer whispering over plaintive strums. A sustained keyboard chord gradually rises in volume, while Campbell occasionally injects some erratic drumming and Mercer's whispers become a wordless, wailed refrain. The song builds in intensity, but then suddenly vanishes, leaving nothing to hold on to. ""A Feeling: I Felt It"" is similarly constructed, but pulls off the trick a little better. Starting with a skittering programmed beat and a bass line that sounds like it was recorded in an adjacent room, the song shapes up with Mercer's echoing and chiming guitars. Mercer repeats a vocal phrase as if chanting, but-- as throughout the EP-- his vocals are shrouded in effects to the point of unintelligibility. As it gains volume, it becomes increasingly hypnotic, conjuring Animal Collective's teetering sonic architectures.
    </p>
<p>
    While these experiments certainly show another side of Frog Eyes' project, they ultimately sound too haphazard and accidental to inspire repeated listens. On the one hand, the songs' peculiar structures could be a mirror for the EP's apparent preoccupation with the time and the future: linear progressions that build toward some perceived climax, only to collapse into yet another linear progression as soon as that climax is reached. But conceptual conceit aside, there's too little of what makes Frog Eyes such an arresting listen in the first place. Throughout, Mercer's vocals and lyrics are obscured, so that they surface in glimpses before waves of sound send them back to the bottom of the mix. So instead of Mercer's typical bursts of lyrics, you're left with snippets like ""the little parking lot is paid for all day until dawn by the senator"" from ""Politics"". Moreover, on its albums, the band uses less penetrable music to create tense foils for truly gorgeous eruptions. On <em>The Future</em>, the music lacks that sense of redemption. Only on opener ""Future Fortress"", in which Mercer sings over a fragile acoustic guitar line, do Frog Eyes approach such heights. But ""Fortress"", like every other track on this disappointing release, evaporates at the precise moment it seems to be getting somewhere.

    While the Brooklyn-based trio Au Revoir Simone's synth-pop is always simple, elegant, and ethereal, it's expressed in two distinct modes which approximately divide the album. The first is musically fanciful and lyrically Pollyannaish, and it dominates the first half of the album and makes good on the promises implicit in its title. On ""Through the Backyards"", a swaying keyboard melody and subtle twitters ride pneumatically hissing percussion. Band members Heather D'Angelo, Erika Forster, and Annie Hart breathe out dulcet harmonies over the rigid rhythm of the music, rhapsodizing about cherry trees and declaring that you can ""just make a wish and everything comes true."" The drum machines on ""Hurricanes"" pop and trill beneath bright keyboards until canned applause segues into a jaunty Charlie Brown piano. The vocal melody and the didactic platitudes it contains are remindful of Kimya Dawson: ""Dreaming takes you where you want to be/ Don't follow the status quo/ Picture where you'd like go."" It's not realistic, but it's not supposed to be -- it's encouragement, the anti-synth-pop to the Moldy Peaches anti-folk, without the schmaltzy affectations.</p><p>
    In the record's second half, a contrary mood takes over-- Au Revoir Simone are still concerned with romance, but they shed their bubbly pep for a dark, cool menace. ""Back in Time"" announces this shift with an insistently pulsing drum and dreamy synths that billow up in clouds, shot through with a mournful bleat. It's still sprightly but murkier and less obvious than the preceding tracks, the soundtrack to a crisis of faith. If the album's first half is imbued with a summery sense of hope and good cheer, it's starting to feel a bit threadbare by ""The Winter Song"", the way a sunny sky looks thin and provisional in winter. By the time it peters out into the windblown barrenness that inaugurates ""And Sleep Al Mar"", it's as if seasonal affective disorder had taken over in earnest. The song throbs with the ominous swing of Air's <em>Virgin Suicides</em> score and stately piano figures as the trio murmurs discomfiting come-ons: ""Teenage Mexican boy/ Don't be shy/ ‘Cause I could listen to Spanish all night.""</p><p>
    The album feels bifurcated in a way that's not unsatisfying, but Au Revoir Simone is at their best when they manage to embody whimsy and realism within a single track on ""Where You Go"". For the most part, it's the usual volley of basic piano phrases and cascading synths; dreamy chirps of ""where you go is where I want to be."" But near the end, it collapses into a sleek minor key bounce that echoes the lyrical turn from naiveté to a more sophisticated (i.e. jaded) view of romance: ""It was late at night, I met you at a party / It was a crowded room, I couldn't hear you talking / You tried to hold my hand and then you left without me."" The synths on final track ""Stay Golden"" percolate with restrained urgency, and amid their tight swirl, a sentiment rings out that sounds like the mature Au Revoir Simone of the record's back half rebuking the green one of the front half: ""Your faith was an illusion."" Luckily, if that gets you down, you're welcome to let the album spin back to the first song and start building the pretty illusion again. <br/>

England's the Longcut restrain themselves through most of seven unbearably tense minutes on their debut <em>Call and Response</em>'s colossal opener. Then they go ballistic.</p><p>
    Before I let you get the wrong idea, we're not talking a quiet-quiet-blowthefuckup band like Mogwai, whose phlegmatic compositions often lack any energy to bother trying to contain. Even in their songs' quietest moments, the Longcut bubble with so much adrenaline they barely keep their lid. Lidded adrenaline is kinda the whole point.</p><p>
    ""A Last Act of Desperate Men"" plays like its title. The drummer taps his bass drum like a kid who has to pee really badly ergo can't keep his leg still, but he (the drummer) somehow manages to keep his volume down low where it needs to be. Guitars are more resigned than restrained. A melodically busy, wobbly-kneed bassline completes the archetypal lo-fi array. Bands like Oxford Collapse and Figurines apply a similar aesthetic to catchy, over-caffeinated indie punk. But the Longcut are a more fastidious bunch. They pile on crinkly-edged movie strings and chilly industrial drum machine. More importantly, they nail dynamics as only bands who've sweat buckets together can. </p><p>
    Those dynamics, strong throughout <em>Call and Response</em>, are part of a larger theme: Songs that can only be performed one way, aka The Right Way. Each track-- even the weaker, less melodic, not-engaging stuff-- wears countless hours of toil. Whereas for Ricardo Villalobos applying elbow grease might mean digitally micromanaging each note with a pastry chef's precision, the details the Longcut struggle over are more felt than heard, the band's tools-at-hand simpler and less predictable. Unburdened by conventional 8-bar rock song symmetry, ""Transition"" builds and builds, surging forward with fuzz bass, trashcan garage drums, and sparkling guitars. But the song doesn't dick you along for the heck of it, like an Explosions in the Sky plodder might; rather, it offers an exhilarating snapshot of a young trio getting its ya-ya's out.    </p><p>
    There's some boring shit here, no doubt, not to mention some oppressively bleak songs like ""Lonesome No More!"". It's not that the Longcut deal specifically in gritty subject matter or somber ballads, but their music evokes these grim landscapes, the kind that look way worse from the inside, like bored suburban kid's block or old cashier lady's supermarket or this band's Manchester. Still I wouldn't call them depressed. Depressed bands sit around waiting for stuff to happen; The Longcut rush to accomplish everything before it's too late, often just sounding like their work is grim business. ""The Kiss Off"" goes for a trancey, somberly meditative effect, layering threnodic ""hyoooooooo""s over a dull riff and a trip-hop bassline before exploding (volume-wise) in a way that's somehow both perfunctory and painfully deliberate. We can talk dealbreakers: Lee Gale's vocals channel first-decade Sonic Youth-- his performance on ""A Last Act of Desperate Men"" has that same disembodied, floating-in-the-ether quality as Lee Ranaldo's spoken word seances on <em>Daydream Nation</em>-- which works for me but won't for everybody.  </p><p>
    The album softens a bit in its waning minutes, closing with a pair of tracks built around drum machine and shimmering, out-comes-the-sun guitar swells. ""Vitamin C"" and ""Spires"" identify more closely with Norfolk techno whiz kid Nathan Fake's cool catharsis than SY's frigid Reagan-era stuff. Neither is a great song but together they constitute a salient reminder about the ambitious, energetic, and frequently irresolute music this band makes: Chemistry is hard to pin down-- it doesn't have a pitch or a tempo or a timbre-- but the Longcut's is present in <em>Call and Response</em>'s every molecule. <br/></p></div>"|9188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9188-a-call-and-response/|7.6|Sam Ubl

    Office of Patents Commissioner in 1899. I'm not going to make a similar
    myopic mistake, but when it comes to this hyperbolic spaz-metal stuff,
    nothing's too new or shocking. Ever since GWAR started appearing on
    Jerry Springer and Fantomas followed an album containing one 70-some
    minute song with another whose tracks averaged less than 90 seconds
    apiece, the oddities of bands like Philadelphia's An Albatross seem
    downright funny, more self-importantly ritualistic than artistic.</p><p>
    By
    ""funny"" I mean no disrespect-- especially since An Albatross boast
    an irrefutably amazing live reputation-- but throwing sushi on fans or
    whatever just doesn't translate to <em>Blessphemy</em>, their second
    album. Frontman Edward B. Geida III, for all his stage antics, sounds
    completely flattened on wax, his shrill gremlin yelps easily mistaken
    for feedback or some other unwanted noise. Essentially an instrumental
    band, their pithy songs show off some ideas, though continually feel
    obliged to return to one of two default settings-- high-minded organ
    prog and breakneck thrashcore.</p><p>
    Predictably, there's a tension
    between lofty technical proficiency and the occasional catchy hook. ""Sacred Geometry"", the album's most pleasantly surprising track,
    flaunts a mutant disco bassline that improbably complements the band's
    signature organ atmospherics. Seemingly taking cues from Hella-- a
    band who, like An Albatross now, initially succumbed to spaz-core
    tropes before embracing their inner-NES sensibilities-- this song and
    brief snippets such as the menacing stage boss theme of ""Hairobics""
    offer Nintendocore as a viable solution for spaz monotony.
    </p><p>
    Unfortunately,
    this option's under-utilized, the band instead deploying
    fall-on-your-face riffs that hang as garishly around the neck as their
    namesake bird. Unlike, say, System of a Down, where hummable vox thread
    together rhythmically unstable onslaughts like these, Geida pretty much
    leaves his band out to dry. For brief periods, ""Tossin' and Turnin' All
    Night"" glides smooth on classic rock riffs, shit grin on face,
    upper-lip stiffened, only to disintegrate into violently pulsating
    mush. I can understand the cock rock anxieties these devout spaz's must
    feel (especially when they're one prolonged organ chord away from aping
    the Doors), but with little to latch onto here, it looks like you'll
    feel the full <em>Blessphemy</em> when this traveling circus arrives in your town.

    Wearing the black and dusty cloak of the world-weary and old-blooded is an authenticity trick as old as the blues-- just ask Johnny Cash. Or Bob Dylan, who let Columbia claim his train-hopping, fightin'-for-nickles hobo routine as the god's honest truth, the life-giving seeds of an Authentic American Musician. Telling stories is what great artists do; the best of them even cover their tracks a bit while they do it so, you know, we can believe ‘em some.</p><p>
    Not so with Murder by Death, who sound an awful lot like the college boys and girls they presumably were not so long ago, rocking university parties with their rollickin' drinking songs and older-than-our-years schtick. Comprised of equal parts vaudeville dramatics, one-eyed orchestral slashes, and polka-- also known as Cash, pirates, and Tom Waits-- they've named their newest <em>In Bocca Al Lupo</em>. Why? Italian students, on the eve of exams, trade that phrase (""In the Mouth of the Wolf"") for the equally bathetic reply: ""Kill the Wolf"". Would they, the four Murder By Deaths, make us believe they had even seen a wolf, let alone slaughtered one to ace Biology, they'd have a better record.</p><p>
    There is, presumably, no one among us who wouldn't trade our lives for that of a pirate, a Romanian gambler, or a spot in the <em>Star Wars</em> cantina, so it's difficult to fault Murder by Death for subject matter. And once, in a vast German beer hall, I caught a traditional German Folk Act, piping and foot-stomping their way through John Denver's ""Country Roads"", an experience I thought I'd never have again-- until <em>In Bocca Al Lupo</em>, anyway, which captures both the in-a-foreign-and-strange-land bit and the fact the music's origins are, like Mr. Denver, as mundane as it gets back home in Philadelphia or wherever you're from.
    </p>
<p>
    Some of you will be better escapists than I am, and <em>In Bocca</em> for you will then be exactly as good as your imagination. ""Boy Decide"", on which Adam Turla's vocals swirl up over Sarah Balliet's gruff bass and a polka lurch-- ""Some men crave women/ And some men crave gold/ Some folks die too young/And some die too old""-- could be life and death, if you could screw up the audacity to believe the platitudes. And ""Dead Men and Sinners"", a Waits pirate ballad bulked up by the sound of glass mugs clinking, floor-pounding, and a chorus of drunk men doubling every word, will surely be the soundtrack to someone's <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> Halloween ensemble come October. I like ""Brother"", which goes, ""I know there's better brothers/ But you're the only one that's mine,"" because this sentiment kinda describes my friends, a little bit anyway; next time we rumble or whatever, I'll make sure to bring the boombox.
    </p>
<p>
    As technicians, MBD cannot be faulted, whether on the slow thump and plucked strings, hand claps, and a cappella choruses on ""Dynamite Mine"" or the languorous vocal and implacable drums of ""Raw Deal"", which is one of the few songs here that actually sounds like they wrote it. And should you lack for drama in your day-to-day-- well, they've got some for you right here.

Domino/Leaf celebrates the switchover with deluxe 2xCD     editions, adding relevant singles and B-sides on the additional discs. It feels     odd at first to see Dan Snaith's 2001 debut album re-christened a Caribou     record-- it's so different from where he'd be two years later, it seemed     right that it would remain a Manitoba project forever. Plus the record <i>sounds</i> so Manitoba-y, a quieter thing born of a place with vast spaces and frost on the     ground and kids taking the bus to school when it's still dark out.</p>
<p>With <i>Start Breaking My Heart</i>, Snaith failed to carve     out an original space in music, but he was still doing post-Boards of Canada     IDM very well. Around this time Múm also entered the scene, trading on warm     synth pads, kiddie vocals that hinted at youth slipping away, and song titles     that showed an awareness of exactly the kind of effect the music was meant to     evoke (Múm's ""I'm 9 Today"" vs. Manitoba's ""Children Play Well     Together""). The aesthetic worked so well at the time and I wanted to hear     as much of it as possible.</p>
<p>If we've been since deluged with labels that release nothing     but electronic music of this stripe, that shouldn't take away from the easy     pleasure of <i>Start Breaking My Heart</i>. I still get a little lump in my     throat when the cut-up and pitch-shifted vocals waft through ""People     Eating Fruit"", like a soap bubble floating through an empty nursery. And     Snaith tipped his hand early that he had more going on than the fluffier Morr     moves, especially in his use of acoustic drums. ""Mammals vs.     Reptiles"" and ""Schedules &amp; Fares"" had the live     instrumentation-- ride cymbals, acoustic bass, and horns-- that would become     critical when his sound veered sharply on 2003's <i>Up in Flames</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Start Breaking </i>bonus disc contains two 12""     singles and a number of B-sides. Snaith was at this time wandering a bit, a man     without a fixed style who could do many things well. A couple of tracks     (""Webers"", ""If Assholes Could Fly, This Place Would Be an Airport"")     found him trying his hand at then-current two-step beats, while tracks like     ""218 Beverly"" and ""Anna and Nina"" were extensions of the     idyllic electronica of his debut. The bonus material is of a piece with <i>Start     Breaking My Heart</i> but finds him testing the established boundaries that his     next record would ignore completely.</p>
<p><i>Up in Flames </i>announced itself as a change in     direction when a swell of guitar and vocals introduced ""I've Lived On A     Dirt Road All My Life"". Swirling, wordless vocals, chiming guitars,     absurdly huge drum breaks, massive climaxes-- all the interests Snaith has     pursued since were there in force on this first track. Having not listened to     it for close to a year, I braced myself for disappointment, half-expecting to     hear it with the ears of people bored by this record (and there are plenty of     them out there). Nope, still works wonders for me.</p>
<p>If <i>Start Breaking My Heart </i>found pleasure in moments     of serene contemplation, <i>Up in Flames </i>heard happiness as a loud,     crashing thing that was messy and simple and pure. It's the kind of record     where the joy you sense in its creation carries through to the listening     completely undiminished-- a feeling reinforced by the Caribou live show, a     tightly sequenced mix of pre-recorded tracks and live instrumentation in which     almost every track builds to a thundering two drum kit peak. The sound Snaith     debuted with on <i>Up in Flames</i> and developed with <i>The Milk of Human     Kindness </i>is easy to describe in terms of other bands, blending Mercury Rev,     Neu!, Brian Wilson, and a few others in specific proportions. It's most     certainly a formula, but then, so is E=MC2.</p>
<p>The <i>Up in Flames</i>-era B-sides are mostly curiosities     adding little to the overall picture. It's not hard to see why many of them     were cut, as they come a little too close to tracks already on the album     (""Cherrybomb"") or relate more to the low-key serenity of the debut     (""Silver Splinters"" and ""Seaweed""). All are enjoyable to     varying degrees but none are essential; still, they make for a good bonus disc.

<em>Impeach My Bush</em> is the best title Peaches has ever
    given anything. Those three words manage to take every one of her big
    enthusiasms-- genitals, body hair, political subversion, referring to herself
    in the self-aggrandizing third person-- and wrap them up into one incredibly
    tacky slogan that <em>means absolutely nothing</em>. (Which of a million things
    is it asking you to do: Call your senator? Go down on her? Make porn, not war?)
    Since 2001 or so, hip well-informed urbanites have been trying to figure out
    what this act means, what it signifies, what the point is-- whether it's meant to
    be sexy, shocking, ironic, empowering, electroclash, rock music, or just a
    joke. This title is one reminder of why they haven't gotten very far.</p><p>
    To those still searching for meaning, <em>Impeach My Bush</em>
    will just be more of the same, though maybe a tad easier to like: Now that the
    Peaches schtick is <em>so</em> 2001, there's something kind of lovably punk about
    how happily she's sticking with it. The real point, though, is that
    well-informed meaning-searchers are just not Peaches' audience. Peaches doesn't
    <em>mean</em> stuff. Peaches, like sex, <em>acts</em> stuff, actualizing a whole
    mess of conflicts and contradictions. And it's easy to imagine why that act
    would strike right at the raw nerves of a whole lot of people-- and I'm not even
    thinking of urban clubs and gay culture, where acting out sexual contradictions
    is par for the course. What if you were a horny average-looking teenage girl in
    a boring Florida town? What if you got the sense that everyone thought your
    horniness was a sign of your own lack of self-respect? Wouldn't it be awfully
    intriguing to come across Peaches-a hyper-sexualized near-naked woman, grunting
    and dirty-talking and showing off her pubic hair, only in a way that <em>made
    typical heterosexual guys uncomfortable</em>? That scared them and grossed them
    out? What if you were one of those guys, trying to figure out why Peaches
    unsettled you quite so much?</p><p>
    Ha, well: Maybe it's ""Two Guys for Every Girl"", the part where
    she says she wants to see guys fuck each other. ""An ass is an ass,"" she says
    and then, on and on, ""Slappin' those dicks all over the place/ Rubbin' that shit
    all up in your face."" That little reversal is as close to a fixed ""meaning"" as
    I can find in Peaches: That female sexuality gets turned from a point of
    vulnerability or exploitation into a point of fear-inspiring dominance. All of
    which she acts out in the tackiest fashion possible-- another reason her act
    isn't really aimed at urbane meaning-searchers. Anyone who's spent time working
    through those contradictions in any serious way is likely to wind up feeling
    downright patronized by Peaches: That's as far as she thinks you've gotten on
    this one? 
    </p>
<p>
    The music winds up running into the same problem. <em>Impeach
    My Bush</em> is without a doubt her most competent record yet, a definite return
    to firm ground after the flailing of <em>Fatherfucker</em>-- it has variety, it has
    dynamics, and it sounds controlled and confident. But it also seems not to
    trust itself, always returning to the obvious tricks, making things <em>right</em>
    rather than keeping them as disorientingly rough-edged as her debut. Worse is
    when Peaches feels the need to inject extra signifiers of toughness: Just when
    you start to immerse yourself in some spooky mechanized clatter, in comes the
    Joan Jett act with a bunch of cock-rock guitar riffs. It isn't just that it's
    too obvious, it's that it disrupts the main thing she has going for her-the
    thing that makes her early singles still captivating on the dance floor. 
    </p>
<p>
    Which is why it sounds, these days, like Peaches isn't
    looking at the dance floor anyway. <em>Fatherfucker</em> seemed to be casting
    aimlessly around for something new and arty, some way to keep the
    meaning-searching audience convinced she might actually be clever. <em>Impeach
    My Bush</em> returns to basics, as if she's finally figured out who exactly
    those basics are <em>for</em>. There's a song here, after all, called ""Rock the
    Shocker""-- after the beloved teen Shibboleth hand-sign for ""two in the pink, one
    in the stink."" This feels like a rock'n'roll agenda in the same way that Chuck
    Berry had a rock'n'roll agenda: You make something that'll read to most people
    as crass, obvious, stupid, disposable, and lamely salacious (""Won't you play
    with my ding-a-ling?"" asks Berry), and it delights the exact population of
    young people who need to see exactly those issues played out in front of them.
    Peaches just has the dual misfortunes of (A) Not being as good at it, and (B)
    trying to pull of hypersexuality in a day and age where Chuck Berry's already
    been caught putting spy cameras in public restrooms. Good luck.

How do they make oft-cited influences sound fresh? Long answer: The Cairo Gang take the instrumentation of gentle British 70's folk with the free-form composition and detached, beard-stroking vibe of post-rock, all executed with the fidelity and humility of homespun indie rock. Short answer: <em>The Cairo Gang</em> cuts across musical movements of several years' span to create music sounding distinctly out of time.</p><p>
    ""Warning"" is an early highlight and as good a mission statement as any, layering plucked acoustic chords and breathless woodwinds over undulating bass and shaker percussion. But soon after that, the pretty backward-ran tones of ""A Hammer for the Temple"" dissolves after barely a minute into the feedback-laden ""Assholes"", burrowing through eardrums for three times as long. Guitarist Emmett Kelly has accompanied several other artists such as Beth Orton and Edith Frost as a supposed <em>wunderkind</em>, but the record is free of show-offy virtuosity or flash. Kelly's talents lie in his intuition, and that's a big part of why the jarring shifts between songs don't sound forced, just restless. Some of it was drawn from material Kelly worked on by himself, explaining the often home-recorded feel, though he drafted more musicians and completed recording in at least three other cities before finishing this diverse whole. Certainly, ""So it Goes"" couldn't roll its lurching, lopsided rhythm without a rhythm section, nor would ""Mother Earth"" drop the placid tension of its solo acoustic first half for the full-band sigh of the finale, the closest thing the album has to a lighters-up anthem.</p><p>
    Still, most of it doesn't sound much like ""Assholes"", just drifting folk recorded in a mellow mood. Tracks like ""Me and You"" occasionally bring a aftertaste of guilt with the rush of nostalgia-- if you've got a Nick Drake album, you've heard these sounds before. While gentle acoustic numbers dominate, ""Shiloutte"" and ""Funnel Cloud"" are strong reminders of Sonic Youth's jangle, and the album on the whole reflects the kind of grab-bag aesthetic of a <em>Bee Thousand</em>. Of course, <em>The</em> <em>Cairo Gang</em> can't be measured up to those monoliths-- it's too much like a well-earmarked sketchbook, though it's as rewarding as leafing through the unfinished sketches of a really talented friend. It's a rare example of song fragments adding up to something more than the sum of their parts.

    Swell Maps have an unfortunately limited official discography-- just a couple of albums and handful of singles-- but they made a
    lasting imprint with their distinctively chaotic brand of genuinely do-it-yourself
    music. Just ask Pavement. While Swell Maps didn't go about releasing anything until
    1977, when they self-issued their brilliant debut single ""Read About Seymour""
    (available on <em>International Rescue</em>),
    brothers Nikki Sudden and Epic Soundtracks had been fiddling about with music
    together with David ""Phones"" Barrington
    since 1972.</p><p>
    Recording conditions were desperately primitive in the
    band's early days, but then so were the instruments they played (biscuit tins
    were not uncommonly used as drums) and the songs they were writing. Much of the
    music they laid to tape in these formative years were improvised sketches involving whatever noise-making gewgaws they could
    get their hands on. <em>Wastrels &amp; Whippersnappers</em> collects 23 early recordings, almost
    none of which have been heard by the public. Honestly, there's
    probably a reason some of them had been kept in the vault, but the barrel
    scrape turns up enough inspired lunacy to please the band's fans, who today
    probably number two or three hundred times the band's following when it
    actually existed.</p><p>
    Fidelity is pretty universally low here, but that doesn't
    dampen the spirit of this music one iota. It even adds to it in some cases-- when
    the vocals go woefully out of tune, for instance, it helps that all the sounds
    are running together anyway. ""Harmony in Your Bathroom"" and ""Vertical Slumber
    (prototype take 1)"" will be slightly familiar to fans of the band's first
    album, <em>A Trip to Marineville</em>, but
    they're definitely embryos in these recordings, if not zygotes. ""Full
    Moon-Blam-Full Moon"" is the most fully fledged song here, a rough-hewn punk
    rampage that presages the exhilaration of ""Ripped &amp; Torn"" a few years
    later. ""Sweet &amp; Sour"" opens with a rather pretty piano part, jumps to a
    gentle guitar phrase and then makes a final leap into charging fuzz riffs and
    hard rock drumming in a pure distillation of the psychedelic era that had
    recently sputtered to a close.
    </p>
<p>
    Other stuff is really just floor sweepings, like the smear
    of noise that comprises ""Gramafonica"" or the 30-second version of ""God Save the
    Queen,"" which segues directly to a version of Neal Hefti's ""Batman Theme"", but
    in a sense these little flakes of debris complement the more developed pieces
    and give them needed context. This is still a fans-only joint, though, and with
    the band's two albums properly reissued with great sound and most of their best
    odds &amp; sods out on <em>International
    Rescue</em>, there's no need to rush into <em>Wastrels
    &amp; Whippersnappers</em>. If you like what you've heard on those discs,
    though, this one is mighty entertaining.

    For the uninitiated, some superficial info: Sam Roberts is a Canadian hockey player-turned-musician who debuted with an EP in 2002. Universal snagged him for his first full-length a year later, on which he fleshed out his rootsy guitar-rock sound. While perusing his Web site, I stumbled across two unrelated items that go a long way to accurately describe his band's music. First, the pictures of the five musicians that make up the Sam Roberts band reveal each one to be shaggily haired and scruffily unshaven, dressed in jeans and t-shirts or thrift-store-style button ups.  Secondly, the lead guitarist's last name is Nugent.</p><p>
    Ok, so maybe Sam Roberts' music isn't as rooted in guitar-wankery-as-foreplay as that other Nugent's is, but there's still something decidedly classic rock about the songs on <em>Chemical City</em>, his sophomore album. But these songs are laid back, likely to appeal to your pooka-shell-necklace-wearing frat pals as well as that cool uncle you've got who's stoned all the time. Though no doubt coming from similar influences, Roberts isn't flirting with arena rock like many of his bringin'-back-the-rock contemporaries. His approach is more stripped down, grounded in the singer/songwriter genre. It's like southern-fried roots rock that's yet to be southern-fried, or the Canadian version of Americana, now with twice the rock and half the country.</p><p>
    The disc flops back and forth between distorted-guitar pop songs and acoustic-based jam rockers. Tracks like ""With a Bullet"", ""The Resistance"", and the disc-opening ""The Gate"", lay catchy, sing-along choruses over upbeat, driving rhythms. Flourishes of organ add a nostalgic touch, helping to bridge the classic rock of the 1970s with Roberts' modern style. A touch of psychedelia helps give the songs a unique voice, and nowhere is this more apparent than on the eight-minute-long ""Mind Flood"". The track starts off unassumingly enough, but after five-and-a-half minutes or so, the vocals drop out, and the guitars swirl and echo while the organ drones in the background. Even the bass is distorted, adding another layer of fuzzy noise as each instrument does its own thing. In fact, the song's effect is double-edged, because it's good enough to make the rest of the album suffer a little in comparison.
    </p>
<p>
    The softer tracks are all pretty run-of-the-mill. ""Uprising Down Under"" is a schmaltzy ballad, complete with swelling strings in the background and tambourine accents.  ""Mystified, Heavy"" handles the acoustic guitars a little better, using the strumming of the strings to create a sort of rhythm that shuffles along with the drums. The disc's final track, ""A Stone Would Cry Out"", is also its most minimal, relying solely on piano and voice. It comes off as more sincere than the album's other ballads, but it still lacks the crackling warmth of the upbeat tracks. Ultimately the ballads do more to weigh the album down than lift it up, but <em>Chemical City</em> still has plenty to offer for fans of old-fashioned rock.</p></div>"|9181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9181-chemical-city/|6.7|Cory D.

    Time to make a trip to the local junk shop and pick up an
    extra stereo: Boris' massive instrumental opus, <em>Dronevil</em>, makes a
    conceptual nod toward the Flaming Lips' <em>Zaireeka</em>. Instead of four CDs
    spinning simultaneously, the doom symphony is intended to be experienced on two
    synced, overlapping sets of speakers. If you already own the limited (and
    currently sold out) double-vinyl edition that the folks at Misanthropic Agenda
    kindly released last year, take note: This newer draft, <em>Dronevil Final</em>,
    is a burlier monster. The Misanthropic edition included four approximately
    20-minute tracks, each taking up one side of a record. Inoxia's CD reissue,
    though, packs on two additional 20-minute pieces-- two hours if you play the
    discs straight through.</p><p>
    But, of course, that's not the plan: If you do own a couple
    of stereos (or can score one from a friend), you'll be able to unleash <em>Dronevil</em>
    as Boris intended-- an hour of doubled, layered, hyper-stereophonic sounds.
    Generally, one half, ""Disc Drone"", consists of darkened ambient work
    while the other, ""Disc Evil"", is louder rock. If played concurrently
    in the same room, the two mesh into one gigantic wall of rock'n'drone, but it's
    difficult to know how closely Boris tracked the separate compositions. In many
    cases, it seems the dynamics created are the result of chance. Process isn't
    important to the end result-- I tried both ways and prefer the spaciousness of
    listening to the discs separately. Which is good news, I guess, unless you're
    enough into micro-managing to go for the simulcast each time you need a Boris
    fix.</p><p>
    The program opens with ""Red"", one of the new
    tracks. It's a pad of barely-there Touch-style string waves. As on many of the
    pieces, strains of feedback gradually emerge, creating depth as well as
    offering its sister track something to cinch onto. After 14 minimally drifting
    minutes, drums enter the mix; the guitars/bass take on a Western shootout cast
    not unlike ""Land of Some Other Order"" from Earth's <em>Hex</em>. The
    tumbleweeds are submerged in deep reverberations and accented with arpeggio
    strums. This high-noon shoot-me-up gets paired with ""Loose"", the
    other new composition. It's a wash of feedback and a cymbal/gong shimmer: When
    the two join forces I initially thought of ""Introduction"" from <em>Akuma
    No Uta</em> mashed-up with a cowboy crosshatch.
    </p>
<p>
    The next pair brings the rock. Exhibiting a subtle Deathprod
    or Fennesz environmentalism (think <em>City of Light</em> after a power outage),
    ""Giddiness Throne"" acts as a lower background to the sustain-heavy
    guitar and drums of ""Evil Waveform"". The former is also comparable, I
    suppose, to Oren Ambarchi, though it's more homogenous, with fewer single-note
    slingshots. Its partner in chime, the dooming ""Evil Wave Form"",
    hovers with sludgy licks and higher-pitched background wails. Five minutes into
    the monster, the riffs crush, the high-hat cajoles, and ""Giddiness
    Throne"" just about disappears, sporadically refueling with a continuous
    (but always sparking) rumble.
    </p>
<p>
    Sometimes, too, ""Evil Wave Form"" exhibits a
    quiet-is-the-new-shroud beauty and nuanced echo suggesting diminishing sadness.
    This is but one of the reasons I prefer listening to each track by itself: The
    individual works are teeming with ideas and action, and there's no need to clog
    the air with additional sounds. Here, for example, it turns out that wispier
    moment was a trick. After the pause, it's in-the-red axe grease, shimmering
    guitar solos, heavy chugs, and massive shred.
    </p>
    Providing the base for the finale, ""Interference
    Demon"" is a more ragged, noisier feedback tone, though it maintains a
    certain resonance. (Think Mego rather than Whitehouse.) Its rowdier half,
    ""The Evilone Which Sobs"", begins all gentle-like with airy,
    melancholic strums. A bubble bursts though, and becomes reverb-soaked sludge.
    Soon enough, the track grows almost emo (and sorta Mouth of the Architect),
    the guitar a wailing squall with plenty of gentle weeping and heaving, arcing
    notes. ""Interference Demon""'s screech sews itself onto this clamor,
    offering a nice contrast.
    <p>
    A
    few folks I know have mentioned being bored by <em>Sun Baked Snow Cave</em>,
    Boris' 2005 collaboration with Merzbow. I also found its somewhat haphazard,
    collagist feel a tad flat. Anyone scared off by that excursion shouldn't
    automatically ignore <em>Dronevil</em>. It's another lengthy exercise, yes, but
    it showcases so much more substance, fluidity, and dimension. No matter how you
    slice or dice it-- and hey, why not mix and match the different pieces to
    create your own hybrids?-- it's a pleasingly exhausting lesson in sonic
    variation. Outside of <em>Pink</em>, it's their most inspired work in ages.
    Totally stunning.

    Conceptually, it's hard to be mad at CSS. They're young and pretty and fun and Brazilian! They play damaged, high-strung new wave with electro squiggles and winky self-aware lyrics about fucking and dancing! They're Friends Of Diplo! Just about everything about them is bright and plastic and eye-catching, and that's probably how they've ended up on Sub Pop, a label not exactly known for its devotion to dancefloor hedonism. And that's not a bad thing; indie-rock could always use a little help ditching its predilection toward depressive mumbling, and this is clearly a band with nothing but contempt for depressive mumbling. So CSS should be great, right?</p><p>
    Well, that depends. How much did you like that first Bis album? Because that's pretty much what you're getting here: rudimentary punk bashers with disco hi-hats and trebly amped-up chanting and buzzing keyboards and surf-guitar twangs and simplistic structures and absolutely no hints at subtlety, ever.</p><p>
    The vocals are generally chirpy and terrible. With her broken English and thick accent, singer Lovefoxxx doesn't sound all that far off from electroclash's whole fake-German shtick, but at least her accent is real. It's hard to hear her words sometimes, but it's always easy to hear her snotty half-sarcasm, her come-ons more sneered than purred (""I know how you're doing by looking at your pants/ And this is how we call it a comeback""). And she's not above biting the lyrics of better bands in painfully obvious ways (the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Art Star"" on ""Art Bitch,"" Mu's ""Paris Hilton"" on ""Meeting Paris Hilton""). The band likes its production tinny, all squeaky synths and ugly, damaged guitars, which occasionally leads to deeply shitty experiments like the unlistenable Casio-polka lope of ""Alcohol"". CSS's whole fast-and-cheap aesthetic is more fun to think about than to actually hear; more often than not, their songs end up sounding like the crappy filler tracks from the first Le Tigre album. 
    </p>
<p>
    Still, CSS has a few great little tricks in its arsenal. When they stop arching their eyebrows and put some work into doing time-tested pop stuff, they can be great. ""Patins"" has a nice buzzsaw guitar hook and a searingly desperate chorus hook: ""Whenever I look at you/ I don't know what to do/ Whenever you talk to me/ I don't know what is true."" ""Let's Make Love and Listen to Death From Above"" has an actual groove: a great ripply disco bassline and glassy keyboard tweets and a rock-guitar breakdown that actually sounds something like Death From Above. And ""This Month, Day 10"" is a nice retro new wave set-piece, restless but fun. There's a pattern here: CSS does its best work when it cuts its shtick with a few recognizable human emotions and maybe even a hint of vulnerability. After all, it's 2006, and we're running out of ways to say ""Fuck you.""

    In 2002, California-based musician and composer Christian Kiefer released <em>Exodust</em>, a lovely full-length instrumental evocation of the Dust Bowl and the subsequent westward migration of impoverished Depression-era families. For his latest release, <em>Czar Nicholas Is Dead</em>, Kiefer turns his narrative attention to a new continent and another cheery episode of 20<sup>th</sup> century history-- the 1918 assassination of Czar Nicholas Romanov and his family at the onset of the Russian Revolution. As with <em>Exodust</em>, the album uses a minimalist construction of guitar, strings, and electronics to effectively summon the ghosts of the past, as Kiefer strives to recognize the essential humanity of individuals swept away upon the cold, indifferent tides of history.</p><p>
    Earlier this year, Kiefer released <em>The Black Dove</em>, a collaboration with UK folk singer Sharron Kraus. That collection featured a folk-inspired song cycle centered upon a doomed love affair, but aside from its evocative instrumentation and general narrative thrust it contained little that could anticipate the quiet, lonesome grandeur of <em>Czar Nicholas Is Dead</em>. Although the album does conclude with a startling vocal reconstruction of the folk song ""Troika"", it otherwise makes few recognizable allusions to traditional Russian music. In fact, Kiefer employs several instrumental elements-- keening fiddle, twangy guitar reverb, funeral-march percussion-- that many listeners have been conditioned via film soundtracks to identify with the geography of the American Western. Yet throughout the album, Kiefer makes enough strategic use of silence and empty space to sufficiently envision the vast, bloodstained Russian snowfields, creating a static aural landscape whose looming desolation often seems to eclipse the human drama to which it bears witness.</p><p>
    Of course, as with any such instrumental program music, it's doubtful anyone would be able to identify the plot or main themes of <em>Czar Nicholas Is Dead</em> when heard out of context or without the album's liner notes in hand. Nevertheless, the album is filled with captivating performances and exquisite narrative details, such as the wintry, shivering drones of ""July 21: Ipatiev Returns Home"" or the distant martial snares that weave through ""The Firing Squad"". On ""Koptyaki Road, Night"", Kiefer combines field recordings and solo guitar with a melancholic lyricism similar to that of Loren Connors, while ""The Politburo Dreams of the Urals"" is an off-balance structure of uneasy electronics and distortion. The acoustic guitar and bird-song collage ""Dubinushka"" shares a title-- and perhaps a brief snatch of melody-- with an anti-Czarist anthem by Rimsky-Korsakov, but is here submerged beneath the crackle of an antique 78 rpm record, giving its tranquility the appearance of a fleeting memory. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Will each of us be increased by death?"" asks Czar Nicholas in ""The Czar's Last Christmas Letter: A Barn By the Urals"", a poem by Norman Dubie that appears in the album's booklet. And though Kiefer is not able to supply a definitive answer to that question, on <em>Czar Nicholas Is Dead </em>he is able to sympathize equally with the Czar and his assassins, a group whose Bolshevik leader is remembered in the conflicted, elegiac ""Yurovsky's Lament"". More than anything, Kiefer's music here offers the opportunity to imagine a reflective pause sandwiched between two violent, repressive chapters of recent Russian history--a history that is too seldom patient enough to accommodate such moments of introspection.

    Working with a vocalist-- that is, a singer, not an MC-- might be the best thing that's ever happened to Alias. His skill as a producer has never been in doubt, but the Deep Puddle Dynamics alum's good ideas don't always cohere into music that exceeds the sum of its parts. His craft isn't lacking, but his <em>song</em>craft sometimes is-- like other Anticon soundscapers, he tends to lose focus and meander, obscuring core song ideas with dense layers of distracting detail. Of course, for the Anticon faithful, this ""difficulty"" represents everything that's best about the music. Listeners of the poppier persuasion, who prefer to be lulled with lucid rhythms and melodies instead of floundering through murk, will prefer the immediate pleasures of <em>Brookland/Oaklyn</em> to the gradual ones of <em>Lillian</em> or <em>Muted</em>.</p><p>
    This bicoastal collaboration with vocalist Tarsier, assembled slowly as the two participants traded music and vocals back and forth via the Internet, takes the form of glacial shoegaze-hop. Tasier's vocals are languorous and pretty to the point of nearly vanishing-- in a different context, they might be dull, but here, they're the ideal silvery complement to Alias's ice-blue keyboard surges and sputtering drums. The songs move with elegant deliberation, and are captivating in a sort of remote way; they possess the serenity of objects dusted with snow. The twinkling piano and staticky percussion of ""Cub"" pulse toward a gentle crescendo beneath Tarsier's sweet nothings, and ""Dr. C"" pairs Telephone Jim Jesus's bright acoustic guitar with a nervous drum track and melting synths. These same anxious drums, lolling crazily on busted springs, meet Kirsten McCord's saturated strings on ""5 Year Eve"", building to a brief yet tempestuous electro-pop finale.</p><p>
    Of course, this being an Anticon project, there are cameos. Besides the aforementioned Telephone Jim Jesus, Subtle's Dax Pierson adds subtle textural keyboards to the silken arpeggios of ""Picking the Same Lock"", and Doseone shows up on ""Luck and Fear"". Offset by Tarsier's always-relaxed purr and Alias's rapid-fire, careering drums, Dose's Micro-Machine-Man stammer sounds more impossible than ever, alternating between a sing-songy slalom remindful of Eminem's chorus on ""Drama Setter"" and Dose's trademarked linguistic overload. If his turn threatens to derail the album's temperate thrust, it's redeemed by sheer verve, and ironically, the only ""cameo"" that does dilute the album is Alias's own vocal appearance on ""Last Nail"". The track revolves like an iridescent drill, gradually picking up force-- until suddenly, Alias is doing that generic fast-rapping thing all over the place, squandering the tension and dark allure. It's the only time when the album's hypnotic lull is disrupted; for the bulk of it, Alias stays behind the boards and Tarsier behind the mic, resulting in the most enjoyable music to which the producer's name has ever been attached.
