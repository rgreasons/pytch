    covered by other groups. It's hardly surprising, of course, given the group's
    general disdain for standard song structures and Mark E. Smith's general-uh
    disdain-uh for everything, including conventional singing. For the same
    reasons, it's always jarring to hear the Fall doing someone else's song.
    When I first heard their version of the Kinks' ""Victoria"", I could scarcely
    believe it was real, and I still don't like it. Perhaps I'm too attached
    to the stunning original to bother with the exponentially higher level
    of sarcasm Smith brings to the table.</p><p>
    
    I'm not quite as attached to the Move's ""I Can Hear the Grass Grow"", but
    it's among my favorite nuggets from the UK's late-60s psychedelic explosion,
    a brilliantly arranged song that married trippy lyrics and harmonies to a
    brawling mod rave-up.  Smith and his latest lineup naturally strip away all
    of those elements when they tackle the song in the middle of <em>Fall Heads
    Roll</em>, their 80th or 90th album. By the time they're done with it, the
    poor song is lying in a little broken heap, laid out by Smith's singing-not-singing
    and the band's frantic evisceration of the original's complex, multi-part
    arrangement.  It's not an improvement, but it's different, and the Fall have
    undeniably made it their own.</p><p>
    
    I don't know if Smith intends sarcasm on ""I Can Hear the Grass Grow"", but
    it's hard not to hear it. The guy fairly drips with it-- it's like an appendage
    of his body at this point, and it gets him plenty of sneering mileage on
    <em>Fall Heads Roll</em>, a grab-bag of a Fall album with brilliant highs
    and scattered lows. In other words, it's exactly what Fall followers are
    hoping for, and it continues the band's recent run of strong work, even
    reviving a few promising songs from the dead zone of last year's unforgivably
    sloppy <em>Interim</em> compilation.  ""Blindness"", for example, comes back in
    its third incarnation.  With each subsequent revision, the song has grown
    longer and nastier, and here, the incessant bass crunch and hovering guitar
    parts drip with fury.</p><p>
    
    Other highlights include the buzzing synth romp ""Pacifying Joint"", a New
    Romantics-on-skid-row joint crowned with a vintage MES tantrum, delivered
    in a slurred anti-pop drawl. ""Bo D"" blazes on a mind-fuck Bo Diddley beat,
    but Smith seems to be ranting about Bo Derek as much as the man who gave
    rock'n'roll its swagger. For once, Smith's utter inscrutability comes off
    as more charming than threatening, and he sounds like he's having a grand
    old time getting cheesed off at the world throughout the record.  Check
    his ""you're always a work in progress"" taunt on ""Ya Wanner"", which sounds
    almost playfully directed at himself.</p><p>
    
    If the Fall make any mistakes on <em>Fall Heads Roll</em>, it's simply carrying
    on for too long.  The end of the record feels disposable, with the partly
    acoustic ""Early Days of Channel Fuhrer"" providing variety but not much else,
    while ""Breaking the Rules"" bites the melody of ""Walk Like a Man"" for its
    synth part and essentially serves the same function as ""Pacifying Joint"", to
    lesser effect.  Smith doesn't even seem to appear on closer ""Trust in Me""
    (either that or he's pretending to be a bargain basement Thurston Moore),
    and as a result, the finale is anticlimactic.  Still, overall the Fall
    remain, ever shockingly, in excellent form.</p></div>"|2980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2980-fall-heads-roll/|7.8|Joe Tangari

How was that?</p><p>  Greg Saunier: When I was in the audience, watching their show, they would start a song, and people next to me would start hugging each other because they loved that song. And I thought that was something that I would really aspire to. To do something where music becomes-- and this sounds ridiculous or pretentious or something-- but where music becomes more than just good music.* * *</p><p>  Any band taking cues from Wilco-- let alone the best band in the world-- that's hard to stomach.  Says Dominique Leone, ""You don't always have to <em>sound</em> poignant to make poignant music.""  But I appreciate Deerhoof's challenge here: to comb hair without cutting it, to wash face without popping all the pimples, to be the best band in the world, but beyond that, to be the most lovable, too.</p><p>  So tomorrow, Deerhoof put on their Tuesday best and release their first straight-up guitar-rock album-- short, dense songs packed into familiar forms, full-bodied vocals for unabashed, often gut-punching melodies, less herk-jerk, less of that house-of-cards spirit that coursed through <em>Reveille</em> and <em>Apple O</em>.  Some people will miss that.</p><p> <em>Milk Man, Pt. 2</em>?  Not really.  Deerhoof aren't holding back here so much as redistributing their energies; where before we found cute in the grotesque, now the opposite.  My offer: I'll concede that <em>Milk Man</em> was poppy, watered down, desperate love shit if you'll actually listen close to <em>The Runners Four</em> and realize that it's onto something else entirely-- by turns jubilant, confused, afraid, angry, sad, relieved, all pretty poignant, yes.  They've made us a hugging record.  Nothing ridiculous or pretentious about hugging.</p><p>  Almost twice the length of their other LPs, <em>The Runners Four</em> plays not as one big song, but as three swoops of six or seven. That first swoop (from ""Chatterboxes"" to ""Odyssey"") might dishearten the diehard, at least initially.  Drummer Saunier, famed for his freakish battery, barely touches the set, but in his absence we get compositional tension, which is sometimes more intense than Saunier's top-down.  Dueling guitar lines bristle close in the rub (""Chatterboxes""), and harmonics stab away at Chris Cohen's existential pirate ballad ""Odyssey"": ""Pirates on an odyssey/ We ask the captain 'What will be?'"" Now pirates count for some of the biggest douchebags this world has ever seen, but they get scared, too-- people forget that.</p><p>  ""Wrong Time Capsule"" starts swoop #2 with <em>Runners</em>' most on-the-sleeves guitar riff, a cry to echo singer Satomi's dejected message in a bottle: ""Don't forget me yesterday/ 'Cause today's no place to stay.""  The trill stays fever-high with unison chants on guitars and vox (""Scream Team""), folksy-bluesy confessions/comeuppance on ""After Me the Deluge"" (""Middle love I did do you harm whenever I want to""), up to ""Siriustar"", Deerhoof's sparse-to-gigantic guitar anthem, like nothing they've written before. I think it's about a werewolf.</p><p>  The next third dips into more emotionally resonant stuff-- the furthest capitulation of Deerhoof's animalism so far, where lyrically they can guess the emotions of all things living (people being chased by spies) or non-living (lightning rods).  We can wonder, as they do, if lemons are sad when we eat them, stuff like that, though Deerhoof make sure to push things inside-out, rescuing something human from the rumination.   <em>Runners</em>' gut-puncher, the third swoop rounds out with ""You're Our Two"" as needly guitar lines sandwich Satomi's image-heavy paranoia: ""Cast afloat on icy water/ Can I really leave?"" then ""Ark sailing/ Believe all fools or die.""</p><p>  A somber if slightly perplexing note to end on, it's the right one for this album.  But Deerhoof don't leave us there.  Instead they give us ""RRRRRRight"", a chirpy, stark, primitive cut á la ""Come See the Duck"".  Of course, after an album so unafraid to ask for our love, Satomi's ga-gas and oompah-oompahs feel somewhat inconsequential.  Then I saw Deerhoof play the song live and understood why they have it here: The song is ginger, a palette cleanser as much for us as for them.  Love what happened, they ask, forget what happened, start all over again.</p><p> </p></div>"|2256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2256-the-runners-four/|9.0|Nick Sylvester

The live album has usually been there to capture a moment, something presumably spurred by the excitement of artists walking the performance tightrope in real time. The more you rely on the playback of digital sound files, the more likely we are to wonder why you don't just mix in the studio rather than onstage.</p><p>Mouse on Mars in concert goes well beyond file management. In the touring configuration they've had in place since 2001, with Dodo Nkishi on drums and vocals, Andi Toma on bass guitar and electronics, and the busy Jan St. Werner piloting from the bridge, Mouse on Mars shows are unpredictable, occasionally sloppy, and relentlessly fun. It's not that they're recreating the renowned complexity of the records live. My guess is roughly 70% of everything the audience hears comes from one of St. Werner's machines, but there's still a fair amount of wiggle room for the imperfect human element. Something about the way Nkishi's spazzy live drumming mingles with the programmed beats, or the way a Toma bassline might slip momentarily behind the tempo of the sequencer, adds an appealing layer of awkwardness to music that lends itself to imperfection.</p><p>The first Mouse on Mars live album was pieced together from shows recorded during the band's extensive 2004 tours, and it's a good snapshot of how they sounded last year. Pleasantly short at nine songs and 56 minutes, <em>Live04</em> sounds minimally retouched in the studio. The setlist spans the band's career. Three songs from <em>Radical Connector</em>, one from <em>Idiology</em>, three from <em>Niun Niggung</em>, one from <em>Autoditacker</em>, and one from <em>Vulvaland</em>. About half the tracks contains vocals, and though Nkishi sings live, fragments of his voice are constantly being ensnared in St. Werner's digital net and mixed in as pure sound. Generally speaking songs make do with slightly less clutter, though it's still a busy environment with rich, cartoonish color.</p>
<p>The best moments showcase the band's remarkable musical humor. The frantic ""Distroia"" lurches madly from bar-to-bar, building steam through variations on its stomping, distorted rhythm before exploding into a tuneful hook that would make Harold Faltermeyer proud. ""Twift"" makes one yearn for the lovable goofiness the band displayed in the mid-90s, with another synth riff worth building a career on and splashy fills from Nkishi. ""Wipe That Sound"" goes on a tad long but is a highlight, with its gradual builds to the explosive chorus. As did the last show I saw, the set closes with ""Frosch"", the first Mouse on Mars single, first released in 1994. This version is faster, funnier, and more dramatic than the original record, with an epic chord progression designed to send shivers when it kicks in after a sequencer break.</p>
<p>It's difficult to fault the set list or the performances, and if the sound quality occasionally sounds a tad flat next to the meticulously layered records, in this context the crudeness seems appropriate. With the readily apparent crowd noise and the occasionally dodgy mix, <em>Live04</em> almost sounds more like an audience recording. If there were quiet moments you could probably hear people talking next to the microphones, but Mouse on Mars in performance generally avoids quiet moments. <em>Live04</em> is a soundtrack to a raucous little party.</p></div>"|5468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5468-live04/|8.0|Mark Richardson

He's not just whistling ""Dixie"", although come to think of it, doing so wouldn't be out of place on <em>First Light's Freeze</em>. Barring a couple of surprisingly lean, poppy tracks, the second Castanets album picks up where the first left off, stringing together disembodied fragments of gothic Americana with brief, freaky interludes. All the hallmarks of the first album are intact-- the E-bowed drones, gusty reverberations, distant chimes, sparse acoustic dirges, and rattling percussion. If the torpid, disarticulated songs often threaten to fall apart completely, the presence of Raposa's quietly commanding voice provides a center, shining through the murk like a strong flashlight submerged in a swamp.</p><p>
    
    Raposa's skill as a singer and a lyricist are inextricably linked. His voice has a drifting, spectral quality that's perfectly suited to his overlapping images. Like John Ashbery, he's able to sustain pointed ambiguity for the duration of a composition, taking all around the thing without saying it. One of <em>Cathedral</em>'s most chilling moments came on ""No Light To Be Found (Fare Thee Faith, the Path Is Yours)"", with the line, ""There was no light to be found in you."" Its impact stemmed from the way that Raposa's plaintive voice changed upon its delivery, dropping into an ominous purr, an effect he revives with equal potency on <em>First Light's Freeze</em>'s ""Bells Aloud"" with the line, ""Don't it get difficult?"". Instead of just hearing <em>about</em> bone-deep weariness, you hear it, as if Raposa can no longer hold the song aloft and lets it slip to the floor.</p><p>
    
    Raposa's lyrics are also marked by a penchant for litotes, one that's in full force here, which amplifies the album's sense of fatalism and futility. I cannot befriend you true; there is no sweetness to send; no true work to be done; no sure and simple fun that we don't pay for; no song was sung; we were not taught one thing that we could learn. Raposa's a romantic, but too cynical to believe in it, and so instead of singing an ode to his perfect world, he sings an elegy to its absence. ""I am not walking with a wife/ She won't be running with the dogs,"" he intones on ""A Song is not the Song of the World"", one of two exceptions to the album's diffuse mien. The other is ""No Voiced was Raised"", yet another negation. Both tracks feature lean click-tracks and crunchy rock embellishments; they're uncommonly kinetic for a Castanets album, but if they're peppier in sound, ultimately, they're just as grim in tone: ""No one jailed us,"" Raposa sings on the latter, ""haphazard hearts took no sure stance."" </p></div>"|1775.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1775-first-lights-freeze/|7.7|Brian Howe

Not to dwell on the likeness, but damnnn...this dude mirrors Stipey's breathy croon, whiney yelps, and penchant for vague, impressionistic lyrics to a T. Oh yeah, and he hates conservatives, too. Fortunately though, this Portland, Ore., six-piece does better service to R.E.M. than, say, Creed and the Vines respectively did to Pearl Jam and Nirvana, and judging by these high-concept lyrics and song structures, they're obviously not looking to cash in on a teenage demographic raring to buy anything resembling their older siblings' fav records.</p><p>
    
    Now to loosen up these R.E.M. handcuffs; until this album these guys were making a serious case for the ""American Mogwai"" title. Not that Metropolis reveals a sudden interested in perfecting the three-minute folk-pop song, but here Ficken doesn't let his vocals get upstaged by violins or chimes. While over half the songs from their first album, <em>Entertainment Is Over if You Want It (recorded as Swords Project), reached well past the five-minute mark, Metropolis trims down the average song length to about four-and-a-half minutes. The result? Imagine the hooks of </em><em>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</em> and <em>Up</em> boiled down and vulcanized into heady, sprawling post-punk, all saccharine melodies with artificial sweeteners.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, the synergy between guitarists Ryan Stowe and Jeffrey Gardner continues flourishing despite the increase in cogent melodies. Haunting raga riffs adorn opening anti-war polemic ""Product of Harm"", recalling Peter Buck's obscurer works like ""I Remember California"" and ""Oddfellows Local 151"" while Ficken seemingly plagiarizes Stipe's anti-Bush harangues: ""Substitute words with revolvers, baby/ This scene's got a western theme."" However, as both the song's closing lines (""A crimson pool the liquid spilling in/ Cut to empty space"") and band's previous album title punctuate, Ficken's biggest beef is with media and its effect on the masses.</p><p>
    
    On ""Radio Radio"", Stowe and Gardner intermittently fire fractured guitar squeals, playing the ambulance to Ficken's cries of ""Medical, medical please get me out!"" as he plays the role of a radio playing shitty music. ""Savage Republic"" offers a more palatable, and sensical, criticism, showcasing the band at their most playful. While the guitars evoke skittish Clash reggae, Ficken lampoons poseurs and blind followers in perhaps his most direct attack: ""'Love this song/ Hummed it all day long'/ Hate this song/ Dance to it all night long."" Not exactly Art Brut here, but Ficken makes the most of his modest charisma without sacrificing the band's instrumental textures and complexities. Hell, at one point the dude comes out of his shell enough to jab at the NYC music scene. Sure, the hooks may sputter, the ""atmosphere"" has its holes, and Swords'll leave you pining for a certain Athens band in their prime, but there's something admirable about some guys from Portland trying to rejuvenate activism in indie rock-- as long as it's not by personifying a radio.</p></div>"|7834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7834-metropolis/|7.3|Adam Moerder

Certainly, My Morning Jacket's worn-in rock 'n' roll-- its starchy guitar riffs and Jim James' other-end-of-a-long-tunnel vocals-- seems tailor-made for the intimate crackle of a dusty turntable. But the concisely titled <i>Z</i>, the band's fourth full-length, needs to be flipped over: It has two distinct sides. Granted, most albums still rely on the two-sided format the same way most movies still rely on the three-act plot, adhering to it almost subconsciously. But I'm not entirely sure My Morning Jacket intended such a dramatic difference between these two half <i>Z</i>s.</p>
<p>As Side One begins, the presence of producer John Leckie (of Radiohead, Stone Roses, and, er, Kula Shaker fame) is immediately evident. ""Wordless Chorus"" launches <i>Z</i> with a hardscrabble sound that recalls their earlier material, suggesting that the brighter production and looser, jambandier approach of <i>It Still Moves</i>was a slight detour. There are more keyboards on these songs, courtesy of new member Bo Koster, and more confident experimentation-- a little reggae, a little r&amp;b, even a little ambient. Defiantly flaunting their rural eccentricities, My Morning Jacket once again recall the earliest of early R.E.M., before you could understand Stipe's mumbling, back when the Georgia foursome defined themselves by claiming a birthright to kudzu-covered mythology. It's not really My Morning Jacket's sound that suggests this comparison, but their willingness to let the music retain its mystery despite the risk of seeming obscure or evasive.</p>
<p>So <i>Z</i> abandons the Skynyrdisms of <i>It Still Moves</i>, but that album's lessons remain intact: Compared to those on previous albums, these tracks have more guitar crunch and tighter song structures. Even single ""Off the Record"", with its driving reggae rhythms and James' lively performance, foregoes a dueling-guitar climax in favor of an unraveling outro that sounds like Air noir. ""Wordless Chorus"" hinges on just what its title suggests: Jim James singing aaahs and ohhhs between verses as the band rocks around him. It's as if the entire album, not just this song, could be stripped of literal meaning, as if everything My Morning Jacket needs to say can be communicated exclusively through sound. And it works, especially at the end of ""Wordless Chorus"", when James breaks into a rapturous r&amp;b yowl that recalls the Passion of the Prince.</p>
<p>But My Morning Jacket does have something to say. <i>Z</i>is a spiritual album-- or at least Side One is-- with references to religion and a few barely veiled allusions to Jesus Christ himself. ""Religion should appeal to the hearts of the young,"" James sings on ""Gideon"", and guess who the bouncy ""What a Wonderful Man"" is about. Here's a hint: ""He was leading us through the dark/ He was saying that love goes on."" Even that title itself suggests an omega to some unknown alpha-- sex or death or both. These hints at larger meanings infuse the songs with a weird sense of questing adventure, as if the band is revealing its secrets only to present even more riddles.</p>
<p>Side Two, however, loses much of the strange steam that fuels Side One, struggling to find its momentum and bringing the album back to reality with pedestrian problems like pacing. Following ""Off the Record"", ""Into the Woods"" breaks that spell, making everything that comes after it sound a little pale and less immediate. A dark-carnival organ sets the sideshow stage for James to sing about burning kittens and babies in blenders, and the overly literal production inserts a me-oww and a wahhh into the mix, Spike Jones-style. It sounds markedly better when the band comes in halfway through, but the song still dawdles to a conclusion. As if to apologize for ""Into the Woods"", ""Anytime"" is straightforward rock, enlivened by a pogoing guitar riff and James singing himself ragged. Disregarding its low-lying bass and piano lines, ""Lay Low"" rises to a blandly grandstanding jam as if on autopilot, but ""Knot Comes Loose"" ambles along on Koster's fluttering piano rhythms.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <i>Z</i> ends with the intense, simmering ""Dondante"". Backed only by a casually insistent rhythm section and a barely-there guitar, James sings as if in ecstasy, before the song explodes unexpectedly into a big, desperate chorus that sounds quintessentially My Morning Jacket. Then the song simply fades out-- but extremely slowly-- into several seconds of still silence. I like to think that the vinyl edition would loop that silence like <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i>, posing an answer to the album's question: What comes after <i>Z</i>?</p></div>"|16943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16943-z/|7.6|Stephen M. Deusner

No white rapper has ever managed to reach any level of fame without addressing his race, whether it be the Beastie Boys' downtown dorkatronix, House of Pain's Irish-pride chest-beating, Eminem's obsessive self-loathing, or Bubba Sparxxx's country-rap album. Even Vanilla Ice concocted an elaborately fake backstory and put the word ""Vanilla"" in his name. Not Paul Wall. If you never saw a picture of this guy, you'd have no idea that he's the only white guy in his video; you'd just know that he's a dude with a low, thick drawl who loves cars and diamonds. A large part of Paul's success comes from his sheer implausibility-- he's a goofy guy with a fratboy goatee who went to college and then made his name designing platinum grills, and he rolls with an underground, provincial rap crew who became tremendously famous once MTV realized that Houston has this whole long-standing self-contained rap culture.</p><p>
    
    None of this general weirdness (except the Houston stuff) actually comes through in Paul's music, which is all straight unadulterated H-Town rap, with all the slow booming drums and woozy organs and dizzying clustered bleeps that come with the territory. One of the reasons that <em>The People's Champ</em> succeeds is that it's the first album from Houston's rap Renaissance that doesn't remotely compromise the region's aesthetic-- it's all hazy, narcotic trunk music. Of the album's 17 tracks, only one was made by out-of-town producers, and even that track (DJ Paul and Juicy J's ""I'm a Playa"") has a heavy, off-kilter stagger that sounds completely Texas. Salih Williams and Mr. Lee, who produced, respectively, Mike Jones' ""Still Tippin'"" and Slim Thug's ""Three Kings"", both make appearances, but the album really belongs to the previously unknown producer Grid Iron, whose handful of stormy, gliding tracks are consistently the best on the album.</p><p>
    
    The record also boasts a number of ridiculously great guest appearances. One of the great things about Houston funk is that it forces out-of-town guests to conform to its aesthetics, so the album doesn't come off sounding like a patched-together collection of tracks. The R&amp;B; singer Trey Songz' guest spot on ""Ridin' Dirty"" is all gorgeous silky swagger, and it greases the track just right, while Lil Wayne spits cold, hard gangsta contempt on ""March N' Step"". It's a tribute to Paul Wall that Kanye Wests's near-perfect ""Drive Slow"" doesn't sound out of place when it appears here.</p><p>
    
    As for Paul himself, he's fine, nothing special. He's a better rapper than labelmate Mike Jones (notably absent here), but not as good a rapper as Slim Thug. (In fact, on the bonus screwed-and-chopped disc, Paul's slowed-down voice sounds almost exactly like Slim's normal voice, which is weird.) He sounds calm and matter-of-fact on top of these expert beats, and he truly loves to talk about diamonds: ""I've got a deep freezer up in my mouth and sno-cones up in my ear/ A ice tray up in my mouth, I'm looking something like a chandelier.""</p><p>
    
    Wall can be awkward and goofy, but endearingly so, as on the entertainingly ridiculous loverman track ""Smooth Operator"": ""I got a way with compliments/ Girl, I'm sweeter than mints/ It'll be common sense to let the lovemaking commence.""

But then, this is 2005, and all a rapper needs to make a good album is enough great, complimentary beats and guest appearances to keep the whole thing interesting all the way through.

It's just that their tradition is much older, more rural, and less popular than those of most other indie bands we review here-- Bill Monroe and Ralph Stanley instead of Brian Wilson or Joy Division.</i></p><p>
    
    I don't mean that observation as a purely negative criticism, but I'm skeptical of <i>Love What You Do in the same way I'm skeptical of Interpol, the Killers, and other bands who hew closely to their influences. Exhibiting the Boys' capable, if unspectacular, picking and fiddling, several songs veer toward re-creation rather than reinterpretation, as though their primary goal is to write songs that sound like they were written decades ago. ""Buildings Are Our Cages"" meditates on our modern social enslavement, using a caterpillar as an exemplar of personal freedom. Addressing unsavory politics via a train metaphor, ""Cannonball"" is the musical equivalent of an old editorial cartoon, with only a mention of Columbine making clear they're talking about the 2000s and not the 1900s. ""Parking Lot Song"" and ""Kiss You Down There"" are faux-randy romps, but does anyone really need a bluegrass song about oral sex? At least I hope the Boys intend the chorus ""I wanna kiss you down there"" as a double entendre. If not, we need to talk.</i></p><p>
    
    The Boys sound best when they sound thoroughly modern, less beholden to tradition and more focused in the present. Slower and quieter numbers like ""Bordertown"" and ""All Good Dogs"" allow for more candid reflection, making sore thumbs of the faster numbers. Opening the album, ""Sun's Work Undone"" is a tender lament about impossible love, made all the more poignant for Dave Sickmen's rough vocals. But it's ""Alabama Shamrock"" that proves the highlight of <i>Love What You Do. Seeming at first like an ode to the creative freedom of touring, the song eventually complicates its sentiment, aptly and affectingly conveying the out-of-time feeling of being born too late, of identifying so strongly with the past that you can never make the present your home. That the Boys sounds so rooted in the here and now only makes the song more powerful and that makes you wish they'd stick around.</i></p></div>"|3700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3700-love-what-you-do/|6.9|Stephen M.

A throbbing dose of 4/4 overdriven pop, the song casually channels the melody from Dinosaur Jr.'s ""Little Fury Things"" via frontman Michael Feerick's smooth delivery, which conveys a sense of angst without over-emoting.</p><p>
    
    It's an impressive feat considering Feerick recorded the album entirely on his own, but after you've heard the first two tracks-- the slow-building, piano-and-strings instrumental ""23 Jewels"" that leads to ""Venus""-- you've pretty much heard the entire record. As the album proceeds, APOF's waves of distorted guitar continue to rise and fall and the instrumental breathers come at just the right moments, but there are no more tricks up Feerick's sleeve. ""Venosa"" delivers jagged guitars and a jaunty melody, and it's followed with another plodding piano-driven instrumental, ""Asphalt (Interlude)"". Even the moments of derivation, like the tape-recorded dialogue over the breakdown in ""Eighty Eight"" or the gradual crescendos and declines of the eight-minute ""Wiper"", seem predictable.</p><p>
    
    At times, the transitions between tracks can be charming-- ""The Ramones Book"" is a modest, maudlin piano ballad that kicks unexpectedly into the soaring shoegaze of ""Local Boy Makes God""-- but the album simply revisits the same couple of sounds. It's not just that the pacing is so methodical it nearly makes the record sterile, or that the best song just reminds me of someone else's better song, but for all of the overhwlelming guitars layered onto these songs, sentimental ballads like ""The Ramones Book"" are what's at the record's heart. My perception might be colored by hearing the ""rustic"" version of ""Venus in Caner"" from that song's single release, a precious acoustic rendition that stands perfectly on it's own. It was a revelation: These tracks aren't bult to bruise, they're bedroom pop in a blanket of distortion as a defense. Feerick's simple melodies sound much more apt with subtle coloration instead of overkill. <em>Amusement Parks on Fire</em> has undeniable focus, but it's moments like ""The Ramones Book"" that reveal the most.</p></div>"|486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/486-amusement-parks-on-fire/|6.6|Jason Crock

Still, everything's not lost: <em>Made in China</em> will find its audience-- moody high school girls with jerk boyfriends will listen to this album while scrawling lyrics on their Chucks in multi-colored ball points (probably pink).</p><p>
    
    The album's main setback is its schizo-""love in the 90s is paranoid"" philosophy--scuffed-up ""Sex in the City"" mindset, lusting after problems of girls 10 or 15 years your junior. Hatfield's going on 40 but still stuck in adolescene, complaining, ""I don't want to go to school today/ I just wanna play guitar all day"" on ""Stay Awake"". During ""Digital Penetration""-- is this an 'N Sync cover?-- she protests ""shiny girls with no opinions,"" and parties where everybody knows the words except her; ""Send Money"" has to break some record for most unimpassioned petition for allowance money (albeit from God).</p><p>
    
    But what's she so pissed off about anyway? School hasn't been the root of her problems for years, and while retro stunts do well to remind us of comparatively jaded pseudo-punk femme fatales of yesteryear, what's past is past: ""New Waif"" might portend potentially catchy bulimia-rock (a 90s Bettie Serveert and Velocity Girl vomitfest, at best) but gets old quick: Hatfield has nothing new to say besides ""You don't know what it's like to be perfect,"" and it might explain her perfect-person tendency toward carelessness-- guitar solos, grating vocals (remember that time she picked up smoking to make her voice edgier?), overdone crabbiness-- all signs that point to thinly veiled midlife crisis rock. </p><p>
    
    But Hatfield doesn't care what we think-- doesn't care if we buy her records-- and the half-assedness shows. At best, the inattention doubles up as deeply felt passion; at worst-- and it's mostly always at worst-- it's self-inflicted cuts doused in lemon juice. On ""What Do I Care"", she's shocked when we don't sing her praises-- ""I'm amazed you don't find me delicious/ Look at me, I'm a rock star!""-- and we're shocked she can't see why not.</p></div>"|3765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3765-made-in-china/|5.0|Rachel Khong

After millions of years of     predator-avoidance natural selection, we've evolved     the ability to discriminate very slight differences in     frequency and to recall entire sequences of tones from     memory. [NOTE: statement not applicable in Kansas and     Harrisburg, Pa.] In modern times, we've     harnessed this fantastic skill for truly awe-inspiring     tasks, such as perfectly beat-matching LCD Soundsystem     into New Order, or scowling derisively when a band's     rhythm guitarist is a half-step out of tune.</p>
<p>These wondrous abilities are what had me dreading the     American reissue of the Go! Team's excellent debut     <i>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</i>. If you haven't     heard the backstory, this lawyer-stuffed country     made it difficult for the Go! Team to clear the     original album's samples for domestic release, forcing the band to slightly     tweak the material in order to purge the recordings of     legal pitfalls. In addition, the record was     reportedly given a gift certificate to the remastering     day spa, a process with the potential to thoughtlessly     drain some of the group's messy, homemade charm in the name of fidelity. With an album that's been     widely available for over a year, even the smallest     changes could prove annoyingly distracting to those     who've been with the Go! Team from their blog-hype     birth.</p>
<p>Fortunately, 1) <i>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</i> is no <i>Paul's     Boutique, and 2) Cheerleaders have crappy legal     representation. To these obsessive ears, it seems     that roughly 95% of the original music is intact, and     the differences, where they arise, are minimally     distracting. The fanfare horns that kick off ""Junior     Kickstart"" might be slightly tweaked, ""Bottle Rocket""     might have a new rap from new frontwoman Ninja,     they may have swapped one schmaltzy trumpet solo     for another on ""Everyone's a VIP to Someone"", but     rarely do the alterations change the character of the     song. Even the EPCOT ride through girl-group history     ""Ladyflash"", which I had most feared would go under     the knife, is left unspoiled by copyright     considerations, praise the courts.</i></p>
<p>Equally non-intrusive is the remastering, which does a     nice job of housekeeping the extraneous hisses while     maintaining the band's collage and needle-in-the-red     sensibilities. In fact, the remix doesn't so     much clean up the songs' pools of bleedover sound so     much as merely stir them up, bringing to the surface     some new elements that might not have been so readily     apparent on the first release. ""Panther Dash"", for     example, seems to contain a lot more power-tool     noise-guitar parts than I remembered, reinforcing my     impression from their live show that Sonic Youth is     just as big an influence as cop themes and Avalanches.</p>
<p>With these factors decidedly non-intrusive, the most     significant change to <i>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</i> is the promotion of ""We Just Won't Be Defeated"" and     ""Hold Yr Terror Close"", formerly both B-sides, to the     major league roster. Even this switch isn't all that     disorienting, as ""Defeated"" adds a fresh cheerleader     track to break up the mostly instrumental middle, and     ""Terror"" offers a glimpse of the band's Children's     Workshop twee side amidst the swirl of drum breaks and     marching band blasts.</p>
<p>So the main point of this comparative review is that,     well, there really is no comparison to be made. The     Go! Team, rather skillfully, navigated the     treacherous waters of sample clearance and remastering     to prepare a domestic version of <i>Thunder, Lightning,     Strike</i> no better or worse than the charming original.     As such, it's only fitting to affix the same score     upon it.</p></div>"|3656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3656-thunder-lightning-strike-us/|8.7|Rob Mitchum

Working class? That's debatable, as is much of Lennon's life for everyone save his widow and second son-- but then all good stories have an air of mystery about them. If I were more cynical, I'd point out that one person's mystery is another's propaganda, but ultimately, Lennon is going to be remembered for songs, not his personal life.  Of course his personal life was his songs; to a fault, Lennon wrote about what he knew, however skewed by bitterness, confusion, regret, braggadocio, or even peace and love.</p><p>
    
    Consequently, it's difficult to hear Lennon's post-Beatles music beyond the frame of whatever commotion was going on in his world at the time. Be it bed-ins for peace, trouble with Immigration, various political rants, relationship highs and woes, or his undying love of old rock and roll, Lennon was as partial as the most insular blogger-- and with no pretense of linking his sources. But then, he was probably smarter than anyone he knew (again, save Yoko Ono), and you can hardly blame a generation of spiritual hangers-on for letting his idiosyncrasies and tantrums run rampant. He wasn't the first punk; he wasn't ever really a hippie; he wasn't a poet, exactly, and he was barely a guitarist. He was a middle-class boomer with a short fuse, overtly provocative social and political ideals, but who was uncut for anything besides making music.</p><p>
    
    Lennon's music, as a window into his life, is serviceable. As pop, it's immediately distinctive, if frustrating and inconsistent. As something in lieu of new Beatles albums, it's mostly disappointing. But as <em>Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon</em> makes abundantly clear over the span of two CDs, it was also a pretty amazing document of a mature artist going through the same shit as everyone else does. No, I don't recall asking for another Lennon comp, but as I get older, and we all get further from the circumstances that made him an icon, I'm reminded that his insight into growing up and getting on with life (and any number of distractions) was as keen as anyone's.</p><p>
    
    Collections like this generally serve to rewrite history more often than give representative pictures of reality, but even Lennon's best moments are rife with contradiction and awkward expression. The good news is that <em>Working Class Hero really does include most of his best stuff: ""Imagine"", ""Instant Karma"", ""(Just Like) Starting Over"", and ""Give Peace a Chance"" are obligated to any Lennon best-of, but Ono and Capitol were pretty spot-on by including ace stuff like ""Gimme Some Truth"", ""Jealous Guy"", ""#9 Dream"" and a fantastic ""Real Love"" demo-- not to mention most of </em><em>Plastic Ono Band</em>. In truth, had this set also included the acerbic, Paul-hating ""How Do You Sleep?"" from <i>Imagine</i>, I could've recommended it over any of his solo records save <em>POB</em>. Yet again, Lennon is inconsistent to the end. As for rarities, beyond ""Real Love"", there is a live version of ""Come Together"" (wherein Lennon warns the crowd they may know more of the words than he does-- and then proves it), but <em>Working Class Hero is supposed to be ""definitive,"" not all-inclusive.</em></p><p>
    
    The <em>Double Fantasy-era songs-- ""(Just Like) Starting Over"", ""Watching the Wheels"", ""Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)"", ""Woman"", ""Losing You"", and the <i>Milk and Honey</i> single ""Nobody Told Me""-- stand out from the rest as being a bit slick and out of steam, though in all fairness, also seem far less bitter than, say, ""Mind Games"". Again, it's all part of the legend that comes crumbling down when you actually listen to the songs-- his ""greatest hits"" suggest a guy who, while overcoming some of his darkest demons, was still a long way from being comfortable with himself even as he was living in the lap of luxury. The buttoned-up, proto-adult-contemporary sheen of </em><em>Double Fantasy</em> seems like a big slap in the face to real, live marital friction-- certainly about as far a cry as one could get from the uber-stark performances on ""God"" or ""Working Class Hero"". Pundits might argue that as Lennon matured as an artist, he felt less need to be musically confrontational. I would argue back that I'm a long way from relating to adult contemporary sheen.</p><p>
    
    As a collection, <em>Working Class Hero</em> succeeds: The single-disc <em>Lennon Legend always seemed reductive to me, and there's no way I need the four discs of solo Lennon available on the </em><em>Anthology box set. Better still, this really does give me most of the stuff I'd want to put in my Lennon mp3 folder, and at this point, that's about as good a recommendation as I can give a compilation-- at least until the next one comes around in a couple of years. And what was that about instant karma...</em></p></div>"|4733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4733-working-class-hero-the-definitive-lennon/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    their borders to new visitors. For more than three decades, a
    vast, hazy expanse of almost-famous rock has been synonymous with the
    term <em>Nuggets</em>; now, in addition to <em>Children of Nuggets</em>,
    we've got handy synopses of Afropop, baile funk, Brazilian post-punk,
    and a little something the <em>Boston Globe</em> recently mistyped
    ""reggaetron,"" plus a worldwide, web-like thing where most of it can
    (shh) still be had for free. On <em>Welsh Rare Beat</em>, Super Furry
    Animal Gruff Rhys and DJs Andy Votel and Dom Thomas map out the
    largely uncharted world of 1970s Welsh rock.</p><p>
    
    It's a surprisingly diverse place. <em>Welsh Rare Beat</em> culls
    together 25, ahem, nuggets released by still-extant Welsh indie label
    Sain (which means, simply, ""sound""). Stylistically the songs traverse from fuzzy garage-psych to eminently
    sampleable grooves, druidic ballads, eerie folk and-- on Huw Jones'
    ""Dwr"", Sain's first single, which laments the 1965 flooding of Wales'
    Tryweryn Valley to create a reservoir for Liverpool-- even tabla. The
    catch: As with Rhys's recent solo album, the lyrics are all in Welsh.
    Fortunately, Rhys provides ample liner notes for historical context.
    You think I learned that Tryweryn Valley shit at Pitchfork camp?</p><p>
    
    The disc is laden with finds. The standout is Meic Stevens, frequently
    labeled the ""Welsh Bob Dylan,"" who turns in the joyous acoustic
    la-la-las of ""Y Brawd Houdini"" (""The Brother Houdini"") and the darker,
    funkier psych-folk jam ""Y Crwydryn A Mi"". Another Welsh icon, Heather
    Jones, makes two appearances: First Edition-style psych trades off
    with undistorted, almost-twee arpeggios on ""Nos Ddu"", while the ""Sweet
    Home Alabama"" lead guitar intro of ""Penrhyn Gwyn"" gives way to
    feather-pillow piano and a delicate country-ish vocal. The bands Bran
    and Y Tebot Piws (""The Purple Teapot"") also each make multiple welcome
    appearances, favoring a garage-psych bent, and the latter's cheerfully
    bizarre staccato foot-stomper ""Mae Rhywyn Wedi Dwyn Fy Nhrwyn""
    (""Someone's Stole My Nose"") was apparently sampled by DJ Cashmoney.</p><p>
    
    It's been a while since Wales was deemed the next Seattle (my
    condolences, Montreal). <em>Welsh Rare Beat</em> establishes that
    talented Welsh bands like Catatonia, Gorky's Zygotic Minci, SFA, and
    even grr Manic Street Preachers hardly emerged from a vacuum. For that
    matter, neither did fellow Cymru son Tom Jones. While not
    track-for-track jawdropping-- Eward H. Dalis's ""Calan Gaeaf"" bites the
    Doors' ""Twentieth Century Fox"" riff hard-- it's charming, eccentric,
    and decidedly endearing, like the artists it inspired. The late Titch
    Gwilym's fiery, Hendrix-style instrumental rendition of Welsh national
    anthem ""Hen Wlad Fy Nhadua"" is a final, apt example of an alternate
    universe whose discovery by non-Welsh listeners has been overdue.</p></div>"|2100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2100-welsh-rare-beat/|8.2|Marc Hogan

Albeit brief, that label lineage might tell savvy listeners all they need to know about the Portland group's depraved roots-noise mayhem. You could also track down their recent 12"" on the Yakisakana imprint on which they cover the Who, the Kinks, and Harry Pussy with equally fond but irreverent abuse. Put more plainly, the Hospitals bring the chaotic trash-rock of acts like the Country Teasers or Cheater Slicks to an inevitable-- if not exactly logical-- conclusion, creating a willfully primitive, atonal scree whose flash is that of a string of firecrackers: sharp, immediate, and short-lasting.</i></p><p>
    
    Since their debut, the Hospitals have grown from a two-piece to a three-piece, with dual guitarists Ned Meiners and Rob Enbom joining drummer/vocalist Adam Stonehouse. This expansion has, if anything, resulted in a further degeneration of the band's sound. Whereas many of the songs on the debut maintained, or at least alluded to, standard garage-punk structures, most tracks here are deconstructed, with heavily reverbed vocals and serrated chords flying haphazardly past in fiery chunks. Unlike obvious precursors like Harry Pussy or Sightings, however, the Hospitals appear to have little ambition to drive these raucous exercises anywhere beyond their initial skin-deep assaultive shock.</p><p>
    
    The guitars on tracks like ""Olympic Ghost"" and ""She's Not There"" feature some vicious Bad Moon Rising tones that'll carry innate appeal for a certain segment of the garage/noise audience, and others like ""Moving/Shaking"" or ""Airplanes There"" actually contain rudimentary melodic hooks. Across it all, Stonehouse strikes a curious presence, providing most tracks with surprisingly straightforward rhythms while submitting his tortured vocals and shiftless lyrical observations to an ocean of distorted effects. His work is at its most effective on the album's more experimental cuts like ""Problems"", which reaches depths of almost Jandek-like imprecision, or the aggressive dissonance of ""Be"", the only track here that surpasses the three-minute mark.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, however, the Hospitals seem stubbornly intent on blurring their abstractions into sheer crude apathy. ""I Had a Crummy Shift"" wastes its promising title on an aimless 30-second slur, while ""Rich People"" contains a pointless goof on the familiar ballpark ""Go team go!"" ascending riff. Thankfully, this is a group that values brevity, and the majority the album's several one-dimensional non-starters (""Art Project"", ""Bands"", ""Jocks and Jazz"") won't cost you more than a minute or two. This is a small, welcome courtesy from a band who don't otherwise seem to take listener satisfaction into much account at all.</p></div>"|4024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4024-ive-visited-the-island-of-jocks-and-jazz/|5.2|Matthew Murphy

It's a gorgeously perfect disco-fluff diamond, a lighter-than-air swoop through pop history, a mindless scream of ecstacy, and it ended up at number two on my singles ballot last year. Too bad it's the only good song on <em>Nympho</em>, Armand Van Helden's disco-punk move.</p><p>
    If this seems like a step-behind attempt at blatant trend-humping (which it is), it's also not entirely a bad idea; why shouldn't a top house producer be able to do this shit right? But no. Van Helden's idea of disco-punk consists of layering crunching overproduced metal guitar over weak little basslines and dinky cowbells, then hiring someone to gurgle meaningless sexed-up bullshit over the top. Four of <em>Nympho's 13 songs are collaborations with Virgin Killer whose rawked-up Rapture-biting yawp is unbelievably tiresome and obnoxious. On ""Come Play with Me"", a ridiculously fake-sexy Cr\x8Fme Blush coos about falling in love with a DJ and doesn't even come close to selling ridiculous lines like ""He broke my heart in a limousine/ I was tired of the scene."" Even ""Jenny"", Van Helden's second collaboration with ""Hear My Name"" vocalists Spalding Rockwell, is a sad attempt at rocking out, the singers pathetically failing at getting all gothy and snarley over a turgid metallic bassline. When people are making fun of coked-out NYC hipsters, this is what they're talking about.</em></p><p>
    When Van Helden comes up with a decent idea, he runs it into the ground hard. The first time he lays a cheesed-out 70s rock vocal sample over chugging house drums, it's mildly sweeping and glamorous. By the fourth time, it's clear that he doesn't have any more tricks to pull out. And by the time we get to the final track of the album, where Tim Holden says a bunch of echoey poetry-slam stuff over a lumbering, ungainly riff for six and a half minutes, it's clear that ""Hear My Name"" deserved a much better album.</p></div>"|8411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8411-nympho/|3.9|Tom Breihan

<p>So I can empathize with Fiona Apple, who has gone through a similarly arduous journey on the road to releasing her first album in six years. Earlier this year, <i>Extraordinary Machine </i>appeared destined for<i> </i><i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> status, as the nearly-finished album Apple made with longtime collaborator Jon Brion was shelved, then surreptitiously leaked to the world's music thieves. But rather than graciously accepting a starring role in Fuck the Man Rock N' Roll Myth #67, Apple did a do-over, this time working with Mike Elizondo, best known as right-hand man to the good Dr. Dre.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Apple and Elizondo, that Brion version isn't going away quietly. And now, upon the release of the official retail version, it only makes sense to compare the two-- a sort of musical Pepsi challenge-- given that they share 11 of 12 songs. The differences are far from subtle: For all but two songs, the title track and ""Waltz (Better Than Fine)"", Elizondo overhauled the original takes-- or maybe underhauled is the more appropriate term in this case, given the addition-by-subtraction philosophy applied throughout.</p>
<p>Apple is a songwriter who can turn every relationship hiccup into a calamitous tragedy, and Brion fittingly applied his production talents with the intent of blowing up her songs to 2.35:1 aspect ratio. On ""Not About Love"" and ""O' Sailor"", Brion scored Apple's compositions no less extravagantly than his soundtracking work for the indie-film elite, applying dollops of lush orchestration to place her piano and throwback vocals in an epic frame. Though the material wasn't always Apple's best-- ""Oh Well"" and ""Window"" in particular, sounding a bit through-the-motions-- the symphonic presentation kept it interesting and gave the LP a cohesive flavor.</p>
<p>Elizondo's approach is more eclectic: Rather than applying copious amounts of strings, he employs bits of organ, backwards loops, and busier drumming to flesh out Fiona's sound. But the fleshing out is kept skeletal, so as not to distract from the central elements of Apple's voice and piano. Though the Brion version was likely unmastered, it's still striking how much the emphasis has shifted from a broader sound to Apple's contributions alone, like demos in reverse. You can also pour a 40 out for fallen countermelodies, as Elizondo hacks away Brion's embellishments upon ""Not About Love"" and ""Window"" in his efforts to keep the spotlight fixed solely on the star.</p>
<p>Not to say that there aren't moments where Elizondo either improves or offers a valid alternative to the Brion takes, as ""Tymps (The Sick in the Head Song)"" remakes the routine ""Used to Love Him"" with twitchy synth-bass and ""Oh Well"" benefits from a stronger vocal take. The dreamy ""O' Sailor"", meanwhile, refuses to be ruined, though the new version knocks the original out of its cosmic moody-blue orbit by insultingly replacing actual strings with the synthesized variety. Not so tamper-proof are the triplets ""Red Red Red"" and ""Please Please Please"", the former losing most of its drama thanks to a dull ambient backdrop, the latter ironically softening its single-ready punch on what's supposed to be the more traditionally commercial album.</p>
<p>The officially released version of <i>Extraordinary Machine </i>remains a decent-to-good album, one that showcases Apple's considerable vocal and key-pounding talents. In its new clothes, the album fits alongside her prior two albums, with only the slightly less consistent material bringing it down a peg. The shame of it all is that Apple, after six years of silence, could've made a more definitive, progressive statement rather than something familiar and similar-- and we've got the bootlegs to prove it.</p></div>"|11639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11639-extraordinary-machine-jon-brion-version-extraordinary-machine/|7.8|Rob Mitchum

From the browning leaves to the scarves in the windows of the downtown department stores, it's understood that we're just playing in injury time now, and that any prickly chill might signal autumn's speed trials on the way to another interminable winter.</p>
<p>Beyond the first snowfall, I am not a finds-comfort-in-December kind of person, which is probably why my treasured winter albums mean a lot more to me than the summer ones. There's something to be said for all records that lend themselves to certain seasons; the really good ones have this strange ability to extrapolate themselves across time. When Björk's <i>Vespertine</i> came out in 2001, I knew it wasn't just going to be a record I listened to a lot that winter, but in every one after it. It's instant, like a mirror-in-mirror hallway, folding out into the future for God knows how long, always as much a mystery as it is a comfort.</p>
<p>This year, for reasons I haven't figured out yet, I'm feeling like perhaps the good winter records are going to be even more important than usual. Maybe it's because I'm getting older, and the mirrors are getting smaller. Or maybe it's just going to be that much harder to fend off the creeping feeling of end days without the benefit of summer's attendant glories.</p>
<p>I won't lie: I didn't expect this to be one of those records. In fact, with the exception of a handful of singles, the best of which still felt brittle and two-dimensional, I never cared much for Ladytron. Granted, the whole electroclash thing getting levied against them seemed kind of unfair (the takeaway: keyboard basslines and polygonal haircuts are a gateway drug to dumb press), but for a type of music that was supposed to be emblematic of, if not a stand-in for, mountains of cocaine, Ladytron always seemed kind of enfeebled, their glassy tick-tock a weak substitute for anything properly muscular.</p>
<p>If they lacked the horsepower before, the year plus they spent touring behind 2002's <i>Light &amp; Magic</i> put the meat on their bones. Despite being delayed for nearly a year thanks to the collapse of their UK label Telstar and the emergency room administration required for their still-dormant U.S. label Emperor Norton,<i> <i>The Witching Hour</i></i> is the most urgent and immediate of their career. The earlier records were sort of toylike and plastic; this not only has a pulse, it has chilled blood in its veins.</p>
<p>Every quantum leap record has a quantum leap single, and in this case, it's ""Destroy Everything You Touch"". With a charging chorus and shivery production that sounds as equally indebted to shoegaze as it does synthpop, this is probably the most confident and menacing thing they've ever done. Almost as good is ""International Dateline"", which marries a pogo punk rhythm and a post-punky guitar lead with a keening vocal hook. With nothing but a transparent wash of synths and a simple minor-key vocal melody, closer ""All the Way"" demonstrates that Ladytron's advancement owes as much to their songwriting as it does to their increased production prowess. And, for better or worse, the barely concealed cocaine metaphor of ""Sugar"" (""If I get the sugar, will you get me/ Something elusive and temporary"") proves they could go there if they wanted to.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most surprising thing about <i>The Witching Hour is how affecting it is. Beyond the crumbling synths and the uneasy washes of white noise are lyrics that move between sounding commanding and hopelessly lost; where vocalists Mira Aroyo and Helena Marnie once sang about things like movie theatres and Commodore computers from about four steps back from mic, they're right between your ears now, their lungs fighting with the wheezing synths for airspace. That's as good an illustration as any of how far they've come in these last three years: if Ladytron of old was a truckful of ice, this one's a winter storm, bundled up people and all.</i></p></div>"|4635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4635-the-witching-hour/|8.3|Mark Pytlik

Like so many other terms in our desperately comprehensive language-- unicorn, utopia, Kevin Federline-- it describes a concept that is essentially nonexistent. Ethereality is more of an absence than an entity, a lacuna in human understanding that encapsulates all things insubstantial and fleeting, intangible and delicate, ineffable and intuitively not-of-this-world. Certain sensations are impossible to explain without it, the diffuse frissons of post-rock (the dreamy, shoegazey '90s variety, not the modern conflated-with-math-rock stripe) ranking high among them.</p><p>n Kiss Me Deadly's lusciously ethereal post-rock is leavened with stark contrasts--the tension between languorous shoegaze and kinetic shuffle beats, for instance--but the starkest one is between the band's pulpy name and their pristine music. <em>Kiss Me Deadly</em> is a Mickey Spillane book made into a 1955 film noir by director Robert Aldrich, and there's nothing less ethereal than the bleak, fatalistic archetypes of film noir; every face striped with the hard-edged shadows of moon-obscuring Venetian blinds. As Nitsuh Abebe pointed out in his recent Pitchfork article on '90s post-rock, ""early post-rock bands were constantly talking about the moon, with all of its usual connotations: Weightlessness, futurism, blank space, and serenity; dreamy, cerebral moods; and of course the beeps and hums of the old technology that first got people there."" As if to signal this affinity, <em>Misty Medley</em>'s cover features a contour line drawing of a blank-eyed astronaut gazing past the moon and out of the frame, perhaps at shoes tied at the laces and drifting through space.</p><p>
    Not content to recreate the cerebral palimpsests of Stereolab and Bark Psychosis, Kiss Me Deadly updates classic post-rock swoon with gentle dance rhythms and poppy, lucid song structures. The immediate grabber is Emily Elizabeth's breathy, helium-infused voice, which brims with more chirrups, squeaks, and indelible flourishes than anything this side of Life Without Buildings. As the gliding guitar melody of ""Dance 4"" finishes chiming out the national anthem of some lunar colony and settles into a fluid cadence, Elizabeth's stage whisper wafts into the mix, culminating in shrill screams that woozily bend into mellifluous vowels. On the lilting ""Dance 2"", she makes like a human slide-whistle, cooing and squealing about ""candy eyes"", and on the jittery ""Dance 3"", she sounds like a club-pop diva who wandered into Echo and the Bunnymen's practice space.</p><p>
    If Elizabeth's voice is exquisitely odd, then Adam Poulin's serviceable croon is a welcome ballast. On ""Pop"", he rides the stuttering wave toward a grandiose chorus like an indie Bono; on ""Let's"", he hunkers down in sibilant percussion and a characteristic melody that pairs a dominant, simple guitar figure with a recessed, twitchy lead. The music's most striking quality is that of gliding, which requires equilibrium. Kiss Me Deadly, with their outré female and mundane male vocals, their coasting rhythms and anxious melodies, strikes a balance that holds <em>Misty Medley</em> easily, weightlessly aloft.</p></div>"|4602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4602-misty-medley/|7.8|Brian Howe

The bright red sticker on the front will tell you that instead it's The World's First DVD-only Album. No audio disc comes packaged with The Sun's debut album, only a DVD with videos for each of its 14 songs. You can rip .WAV files from the disc with the DVD-ROM drive of your computer, or purchase mp3s from iTunes or other digital vendors, but put it into your car or home stereo and all you'll hear is the faint whirr of useless plastic spinning in place.</p><p>
    
    The band decided that a DualDisc or an audio/video package-- a route taken by artists as disparate as Super Furry Animals, Wire, and 50 Cent-- would be too costly. Admitting to leaking their record tp p2p networks five months before its release, their choice acknowledges and tacitly encourages file-sharing, while trying to give the consumer a package to get excited about. But aren't there a number of people who buy CDs, yet don't have DVD-ROM drives in their computer? And don't they download most of their music, legally or otherwise?</p><p>
    
    The videos were reportedly put together on the cheap, using handheld cameras and pooling volunteers from Craigslist. Some are undeniably amateurish, but ""Justice"", ""Waiting on High"", or ""Valentine"" all feature competent lighting and editing production values. There's even some ingenuity to the racy shoot for ""Romantic Death"", which splices together grainy shots of men and women facing the camera while masturbating (from the shoulders up). ""2B4"" or ""We Try"" are a little less creative with their limited budget, and the animated collage for ""Taking the Lord's Name in Vein"", full of blunt political imagery, would have been better off with just straight performance shots.</p><p>
    
    ""Lose Your Money"" is a continuous shot of a man sitting, staring at a mirror and a bottle of wine, while half-heartedly mouthing the song's lyrics in between sips of alcohol. He lights a cigarette and rubs his brow, then it ends suddenly with an inscrutable montage of color-saturated nature imagery. It's trite, self-involved, Film Production 101 fare-- yet I've had nights just like it, with songs plenty more embarrassing than the dirge-y ""Lose Your Money"". The director took a risk, and I can't deny my sentimental reaction.</p><p>
    
    I wish I could say the same for the songs. Not that <em>Blame it on the Youth</em> lacks catchy melodies, or that they're aren't meticulous arrangements under the hooks. The band executes polite slices of pop like ""Justice"" and ""We Try"" with precision, but the moments of supposed catharsis-- the red-faced screaming through the third verse of ""Must be You"", or the flubbed guitar solo and thrashy finale of ""Say Goodbye""-- come off as forced. Even the borderline freakout ""Taking the Lords Name in Vein"" sounds rehearsed and mannered. Try as they might, the Sun just can't seem to sweat or get dirty on <em>Blame it on the Youth</em>. </p><p>
    
    I'm not just reviewing a batch of songs here, I'm reviewing a DVD that a good section of the buying public can't even listen to without watching TV for an hour. While there's a broad palette of sounds and images to be found, their multi-pronged multimedia gamble just points toward my main complaint with <em>Blame it on the Youth</em>: The Sun want to master all the mediums, but they don't have much to say.</p></div>"|7833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7833-blame-it-on-the-youth/|5.9|Jason Crock

See: The omnibus of crit on instrumental hip-hop. Pitchfork's own Jess Harvell laid it down, though. While conceding no other genre has ""forced us to sit through more un-reconstituted dreck than rap-less rap,"" he gives credit where it's due (in this case to Dabrye's <em>Instrmntl): ""The one good thing about wallpaper is that it's just thereÉignorability is part of the deal.""</em></p><p>
    So the review writes itself. But, interested in what the parsing of an artistic process can reveal, I try to be optimistic. <em>City Lights Volume 1.5</em> puts us behind the boards of Dutch producer Nicolay, who helmed last year's most fortuitous hook-up-- that unbearably sensuous Foreign Exchange record. An interesting spot, 'cause <em>Connected</em> miraculously eschewed the desert island its emcee, Little Brother's Phonte, steered it straight for: blundering backpack innocuousness.</p><p>
    Was it an illogical, disproportionate synergy, or were Nicolay's watercolor-light compositions that good? Does vox-stripped <em>City Lights reveal the elusive, indwelling spirit of a talented producer's beats? Results are inconclusive. For one, Nic's beats are weaker, which confounds the experiment. This set offers nothing as luminous as the french horn-gilt ""Let's Move"" or ""Be Alright""'s blush-hued synths.</em></p><p>
    But take care not to give the purple-sand beat-making shores of Foreign Exchange's intercontinental entente too much credit. For all Phonte's unmoving prattle on <em>Connected</em>, his verses did provide a crucial texture. The album's single holler-able refrain was a bated ""Let's Move""; otherwise, voice was cornstarch, a cooked-in thickener. Lacking that unifier, <em>City Lights feels incomplete-- yes, even for rap-less rap. And thinness is the genre's death knell; it stifles listeners looking for an immersive opiate spell.</em></p><p>
    Sameyness that doesn't even hold up as drapery? Sounds like ""meh"" personified. Nic's a savvy dude, howevs. He counterbalances our ears' inclination to drift with some jarringly offset kicks. Nothing too bold, mind you, lest it ruffle his fine-knit haberdashery. But ""Intro"" (which incidentally sports tactful backgrounded voices) sways on a rushed snare feel, flamming the simple changes. Details like that are missed on the boringly syncopated ""Fantastic"" and the hopelessly listless ""Indian Summer"". Throughout the latter, undulating vibes await their cup of coffee, but the skipper benches his top prospects, losing with groovin' hand percussion and fusty flutes.</p><p>
    It'd be interesting if <em>City Lights threw us a bone-- a vocal track, just one!-- for comparison's sake. Many songs concede noncommittal spoken word outros, but their formulaic placement (always as a predictable, faded segue into the next track) is fruitless. Monotony is expected, risqué nice but not required; this thing's just too bleary-eyed to sustain itself, much less our generous half-attention.</em></p></div>"|5920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5920-city-lights-volume-15/|4.8|Sam Ubl

    while they were still alive? Their early development was so startling-- from
    pleasant late 90s stoner-hop to a startling mix of folk, kraut, and acid
    house in less than six months-- that we just assumed they could go anywhere.
    Then they released an album that <i>did</i> go anywhere, and they got
    castigated for it. Then they toned down the shit-talking and liberties-taking
    and accentuated the beat-science and hippie-gentleness, and they got castigated
    for it. Then they released an album of pleasant, conventional indie rock and
    couldn't even get castigated. They were as exhausted as we were and broke up.</p><p>
    
    It's pretty clear they weren't the assholes here: There's not a single band
    in the past year with the balls-- or lack of sense, your call-- to release
    a debut album as overgrown with ideas (not always good ones, mind you) as
    <i>The Beta Band. And in 2001, what </i><i>Hot Shots II was offering--
    guitars meet Timbaland, to be reductive-- was pretty much all many of us
    wanted from a rock band.</i></p><p>
    
    A best-of released in the aftermath of an ignominious break-up always feels
    a little less radiant than a best-of from a band who went out on a high note.
    <i>The Best of the Beta Band is a funny beast.  Collecting singles, it
    should ideally give haters what they always wanted: All the band's styles
    in one place. Unfortunately, it has the probably unintended effect of shaving
    off the shag. Missing an obnoxious piece of audience baiting like ""The Beta
    Band Rap"" or the cuckoo twentysomething-crisis of ""Round the Bend"" means
    you're not getting the Betas as they were.</i></p><p>
    
    Sequenced chronologically, <i>The Best of the Beta Band features a
    whopping </i><i>five tracks from their last album, </i><i>Heroes to Zeros.
    So it's missing a few choice cuts, though exactly which ones are up for
    debate.  They could have made room for live-staple ""The House Song"", the
    mournful, rain-soaked ""Push It Out"", or the playful ""Brokenupadingdong"".
    The only thing it's incontrovertibly lacking is ""Sequinsizer"", where over
    a punchy groove they weave lonely brass, Eno-ish textures, and frontman
    Steve Mason's voice cut-up like a flu-ridden diva in a Todd Edwards house
    production.</i></p><p>
    
    ""Dry the Rain"" starts us off, and if the Betas had stopped there, they'd be
    languishing in the 99-cent import CD single bins with Gomez and Travis.
    ""She's the One"" stretches the strums of the <i>Champion Versions EP
    across a full 70mm print, pumping the mix full of Technicolor detail. It's
    not saying much except ""I'm in love,"" but it does so with such swirling,
    ringing conviction that even professional cynics like me have used it as a
    soundtrack to going head over heels. ""Dr. Baker"" starts out hungover in bed
    watching drips of piano against the window, but, by the second verse, a lost
    calliope has burst into the bedroom.</i></p><p>
    
    ""It's Not Too Beautiful"" is a Beatles tune with Q-bert (the video game
    sprite, not the turntablist) on production before a sample from John Barry's
    score for ""The Black Hole"" confuses the axis entirely. ""To You Alone"" is
    where Mason's interest in the plastic r&amp;b; triplets that were everywhere at
    the turn of the last century first took hold. It's very rare to find a band
    both open to what's going on in the wider world and willing to give it their
    own spin (in this case, Faust-like spiraling drum swirls and kosmiche guitar)
    without coming off either cynical or clueless. It was a sound they would
    embrace fully on <i>Hot Shots II, and the tracks that represent that album
    here, such as ""Squares"", are ankle-deep hip-hop grooves and disorienting
    texturally. ""Gone"", also from </i><i>Hot Shots</i>, sends a spare piano line
    wending through a humid fog of reverb.  Mason sounds positively forlorn.</p><p>
    
    It is a ridiculous crime that the sparkling psych/dancehall admixture
    ""Broke"", presented here in its single mix, cuts out before the extended
    groove (the best part-- complete with ""Sleng Teng"" bassline!) kicks in.
    ""Assessment"" brazenly recycles the riff from U2's ""I Will Follow"". Outright
    theft wears poorly on them, though the blazing horns at the end make up for
    it somewhat. ""Easy"" gets by on a croaking organ/harpsichord groove and not much
    else. ""Wonderful"" is the weakest thing here, a barely there ambi-ballad.
    (""Troubles"" isn't much better. The Betas' hippie-speak can go beyond charming
    to, you know, hippie-ish.) But ""Simple"" buffered a particularly lonely
    two-month stretch in my life, and though it skirts banality, a chorus of
    ""the trouble with your own thing is you end up on your own"" is both deeply
    affecting and a metaphor for the entire Beta Band project.</p><p>
    
    If live discs are the definition of ""for fans only,"" then a live disc
    included with a best-of is the definition of pointlessness. Yet live was
    clearly where the Betas gave everyone what they wanted. People could sing
    along together to ""Dry the Rain"". A melodramatic song like ""It's Not Too
    Beautiful"" could be extended past the breaking point. On record, the <i>Hot
    Shots II songs can often provoke a response like the one I heard from
    a co-worker: ""Wow, I haven't heard trip-hop in forever."" Here they add a
    freak-out guitar solo to ""Squares"", all to the good. The drum circle workouts
    of ""Inner Meet Me"" and ""The House Song"" make sense in commune with an
    audience. ""Dr. Baker"" becomes a cruising rock track.</i></p><p>
    
    Judging by this year's King Biscuit Time single, Mason hasn't totally
    abandoned the ""beats + indie"" formula, and good on him. Maybe he just needs
    a little time to regroup-- get his head together in the country, as it were.
    If the Betas promise to release another record, we can promise to afford
    them the respect they deserve. Even if it's just that vaguely apocryphal
    second disc of mountaintop THC jamz that was supposed to be appended to
    <i>The Beta Band. They were always so cute when stoned.</i></p></div>"|672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/672-the-best-of-the-beta-band/|7.2|Jess Harvell

Ask J.D. Salinger. Or George Lucas. Or Kevin Shields. After Broken Social Scene stumbled out of the incestuous Toronto alt-rock scene with <em>Feel Good Lost</em>-- a postrumental refrigerator-hum stiff of a debut-- few would have guessed this group of scruffed-up bohos had a veritable classic lurking in their collective consciousness.  Then, ignited by a rabid internet reception, <em>You Forgot It in People</em> gracefully went boom, and lots of people remembered why they loved indie rock-- the shambling ecstasy, the pitch-perfect experimentation, the unabashed heart-on-sleeveness of it all.</p><p>  Now, with file-sharers queuing up like mad and pre-orders bumping them to Amazon Top 50 status, the collective reacts to the furor by expanding and magnifying; another six members join the brood for its self-titled third full-length, and the band's once-refined studio sound is blown up into a pixilated blur of blood-gush guitars and squall-of-sound production that's somehow meticulously unhinged.  This exercise in excess makes the ambitious <em>You Forgot It in People</em> seem positively understated by comparison.</p><p>  De facto band leader Kevin Drew recently told Pitchfork that Broken Social Scene producer (and NYPD punching bag) David Newfeld ""got addicted to the idea of trying to top <em>YFIIP</em>."" He added: ""His massage therapist says he might die in 10 years unless he changes his lifestyle."" It's Newfeld's risky mixing and uncanny knack for coalescing myriad instruments and voices into a propulsive whole that defines this new album.  Whereas <em>You Forgot It in People</em> was exacting and refined-- each cymbal crash snipped to perfection, each underlying string melody was spare and to-the-point-- <em>Broken Social Scene</em> is wily and flowing. Just consider each disc's mood-setting introduction: <em>YFIIP</em>'s ""Capture the Flag"" is muted and tasteful; <em>BSS</em>'s ""Our Faces Split the Coast in Half"" gets out of bed, trips, falls down, does a sloppy summersault, and gets back up no worse for the wear.  The contrasting titles alone-- one direct, one Dali-esque-- speak volumes.  But, however symbolic, ""Faces"" is only a casual stretch, with follower ""Ibi Dreams of Pavement (A Better Half)"" serving as the album's first true workout.</p><p>  ""Ibi"" breaks in with a woozy, five-alarm guitar-- a warning call for the track's off-key surrealism and pile-on distortion.  Like the shaky ascent of a homemade rocketship, the song constantly teeters on cataclysmic oblivion; shards of chords slip away and grind against each other as the track embarks.  Buried between the static and the void, mumbled vocals are folded in before the brass enters and elevates the endeavor to fist-pumping, room-on-fire glory.</p><p>  That track's garbled vocals and lyrical ambiguity are filtered throughout this record.  With no accompanying lyric sheet, most of the album's highly interpretable words not only provide fans with a time-wasting message-board guessing game but add another layer of atmospheric haze to the group's already out-there takes on sex, politics, and that whole indies-vs.-majors thing.  On the wispy, faux-idyllic ""Major Label Debut"", the chorus could be ""I'm all hooked up"" or ""I'm all fucked up,"" but either meaning snidely puts down the rockstar clichés Broken Social Scene are determined to avoid.</p><p>  Anyone's who's been to a Broken Social Scene show over the past few years probably knows ""Major Label Debut"" as a rollicking, open hi-hat dust storm.  But here, that version is relegated to an accompanying EP (otherwise filled with mostly expendable outtakes and instrumentals) while the album version is slowed down and fogged up-- and decidedly less single-worthy.  Another live favorite and possible crossover contender, ""Superconnected"", is still catchy on record, but Newfeld's all-at-once, in-between-vox production subverts any chance at overt smashdom.</p><p>  Such insular stubbornness leads to <em>Broken Social Scene</em>'s few overly self-indulgent moments, when their lack of inhibitions turns from charming to faintly annoying.  Their tendency to jam out-- not entirely surprising given bassist Brendan Canning's striking Trey Anastasio-meets-Elmo look-- turn the seven-minute ""Bandwitch"" into an aimless jumble.  Along with the similarly too-free-spirited ""Windsurfing Nation"" and ""Handjobs for the Holidays"", such unchecked exorbitance damages the album's hard-won continuity.</p><p>  But a few regrettable overreachings are somewhat inevitable when a band tries to top a record as strong as <em>YFIIP</em>.  Looser and slightly kinkier, <em>Broken Social Scene</em> indulges in the pop eccentricities and keen melodic ears of more than a dozen Canadians who take willful pride in their ability to lock together into one solid unit and make good on the sum of their unique individual talents.  With its doomsday provocation of a title, the epic Springsteenian endcap ""It's All Gonna Break"" bursts forth with enough ideas to keep a lesser band productive for years. The song ecstatically encapsulates <em>Broken Social Scene</em>'s heightened ambitions and flawed Icarus journeys, conflating into a bold, brash love-in infatuated with its own bumps and bruises.</p><p> </p></div>"|955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/955-broken-social-scene/|8.4|Ryan Dombal

Elverum & Sun']|2005-10-03 00:00:00||2016-06-11 20:53:46.467169|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".fu8t5bmkg0.1.6:0.1.0.$5597/=1$5597.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Phil Elverum's latest experiment: audibility. Don't bother cranking up the headphones; <em>""Singers""</em> will find you. And in short order, no less. Opener ""Let's Get Out of the Romance"" dallies on a slow-sloshing guitar line and Elverum's wilted vox before the arrival of a towering chorale. That turn-- all three seconds of it-- resonates beyond anything on <em>No Flashlight, Mt. Eerie's first studio album, released in August.</em></p><p>
    
    Why the turnabout? <em>""Singers""</em> is from the same mold as its forebear: a bleary, lo-fi aesthetic, organic, unadorned instrumentation, and the usual surfeit of opaque first-person narration. Even its premise-- Microphones/Mount Eerie oldies recast in ""sing-along"" versions-- promises business as usual. But <em>""Singers""</em> succeeds, for one, because you can actually hear what the fuck is going on. <em>Flashlight</em> was sinus infection listening-- all bass swell and muffled percussion burbling beneath tattered acoustic overlay. Melodies sank in a swamp of clipped, bleeding microphones. On <em>""Singers""</em>, Eerie separates its milk from its mush; vocals streak through the interstices of piano and stringed instruments, no chafing.</p><p>
    
    It can't hurt, either, that the album features Elverum's best recent cuts. ""Ut Oh! It's Mourning Time Again"" does ditty with rare gestural lightness, the chorus scrambling for the guitar solo like a '66 T-Bird rattling toward a precipice. You hear a round of shrill, echoic howls rise up from all areas of the musical field, lending the song a disquieting but oddly jubilant hollowness. It's a wonderfully spontaneous moment that almost justifies the album's precious gag. Such macabre humor isn't a fresh cut from Elverum, but, gussied up with a tidy instrumental and enough team spirit to power Mt. Eerie to a Great Outdoor Games medal, its seldom been as sharp as on ""I Can't Believe You Actually Died"", whose titular campfire refrain flickers out in hysterical laughter.</p><p>
    
    Throughout <em>""Singers""</em>, spontaneous off-mic sounds give the illusion of a space much larger than Elverum's studio digs. But what does the album achieve that's so different from any basic lo-fi recording? Does Elverum have a special ability to render his persona into aesthetic effects? If so, why has he most recently used it to make tedious, cynical music, knowingly devoid of the humanist warmth of <em>The Glow, pt. II and </em><em>It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water?</em></p><p>
    
    Wrist-slitter ""Human"" and van Gogh tribute ""I Cut My Hands Off"" get by on profound-seeming vox. Elverum's chants of ""hu-man...hu-man..."" on the former are a clever condensation of the songwriter's lyrical corpus, which has never strayed far from topics of nature, body, and spirit. But for the truly mantric, check ""Do Not Be Afraid"" and ""So Your Big Black Cloud Will Come"", both crushingly heavy dirges with concise (you're looking at 'em) lyric sheets. Dude's gotta know, though, not to make every line the denouement; save some of those catch-phrases for the dramatic moment.</p><p>
    
    So it's tough to give Elverum's lyrics laboratory attention when they're so pushy. Like William Carlos Williams without the punch line, his words are whittled down to deep salience then removed from any discernible context and looped ad infinitum. What sounds meaningful reads like jabberwocky. But at least <i>""Singers""</i> will help Microphones devotees-- feeling a bit maligned lately-- start listening again.</p></div>"|5597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5597-singers/|6.8|Sam Ubl

    Atmosphere's MC, Slug, he of the tortured romantic life, intriguing racial
    politics (half-white, half-black), and ""aw-shucks, he's rapping, wait, stop
    shouting"" rhyme style, is getting boring fast. Let us count the ways:
    Reverential past-peddling. Degenerative flow. Lame Mohawk. Weak follow-up to
    the breakthrough album. All the ducks, lined up in a row.</p><p>
    
    At the risk of sounding like one of those kids who watches ""The O.C."",
    Atmosphere was always for those moments when a woman ripped your heart out,
    then punched you in the neck. I won't say ""the hip-hop Death Cab,"" but you
    get the picture. Nothing wrong with the raw sadness and fury Slug
    conjured, but you weren't exactly throwin' your sets up for Minneapolis'
    finest. I always put that <em>Lucy Ford record underneath the M.O.P. album in
    the crate. So the abandonment of that form here, that ""guilty pleasure,""
    hurts <i>my</i></em> feelings. Mr. Heartache, where you at? In its place, I
    guess, is the sap of another tree: Nostalgia.</p><p>
    
    Nothing can illuminate the pomp and circumstance of <em>You Can't
    Imagine better than this couplet from ""Watch Out"": ""When I was younger, I
    wanted to be LL Cool J/ But then he started makin' records for the girls and
    shit/ So I ripped up the Kangol and threw it away."" Uh, what? Forgetting
    that's just a wack rhyme for a moment, anyone who's been to an Atmosphere
    concert surely knows the kind of estrogen jam they can be. Even worse than
    the desertion, though, is that this record lacks any
    growth or good humor. Which is a shame because their previous album, </em><em>Seven's
    Travels</em>, while flawed, started to find a balance (wink) between the
    political leanings that have crept into Slug's raps with his wounded-puppy raps.</p><p>
    
    This is not to say the album's a mess. Like Blackalicious' recent <em>The
    Craft</em>, it displays a real hard-earned competency, something a decade
    of recording together will get you. But the lyrics lack transcendence or
    resonance. Conversely, producer Ant's production is full and springy. His
    growth has never been in question, exploding with complicated chops and
    orchestrations on every album. Whether flipping operettas on ""Say Hey There""
    or dropping pianos from five floors up on ""Musical Chairs"" he's got sundry
    abilities. The songs here are melded beautifully, making the eventual
    instrumental wax a must-cop. In all honesty, I never understood why Ant
    wasn't lacing dudes like Freeway and Young Buck years ago. He could do it.</p><p>
    
    There are exceptions as the album moves, like ""Angelface"" which quivers with
    panging guitars and (gasp) a politically snarky jab at Uncle Sam, masked as
    the kind of love letter this dude used to kill something lovely five years
    ago. ""Pour Me Another"" oozes barfly grease. And ""Little Man"" is pretty and
    loopy. On it Slug says ""I'm over 30, can't maintain relations/ All these
    women wanna hurt me/ And I just don't have the patience."" This is not
    something you hear much on a rap record. It's refreshing. Of course, if you
    want to be a dick about it, Juelz Santana murdered the same sample used on
    ""Little Man"" on the first Diplomats album back in 2003 without sacrificing
    his diary entry. Pity.</p><p>
    
    On their fifth proper, the attempts to merge Slug's emotionally aware,
    sneering theatrics with the sort of nostalgia-4-cheap malarkey that passes
    for ""conscious"" hip-hop these days is a crashing failure. Like Edan and
    Little Brother's reminiscent melancholy from this year, listening to Slug
    disregard hip-hop's sonic development is like stuffing a chloroform-soaked
    Shelltoe in your mouth. Don't you know we rockin' Bapes these days, mang?</p></div>"|344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/344-you-cant-imagine-how-much-fun-were-having/|5.9|Sean Fennessey

Aconite's a sedative, but also a poison, and hoo boy somebody stop me before I start constructing one of those specious metaphors linking a band's music to their (probably arbitrarily chosen) name. Nothing poisonous here anyway, unless you're fatally allergic to the kind of music that tends to hover in place instead of moving. <em>Spider Through the Fog</em> is tranquilizer-dosed phantom folk drifting bodiless through veils of mist, medleys of cloudy ambiance marshaled into improbable pop songs. On the microphone, they came to haze and amaze you: The murkier side of Animal Collective (that would be Panda Bear) after a Donovan binge, with snatches of Four Tet coming through the wall.</p><p>Put a bunch of smarty-pantses together with a random assortment of instruments (besides the usual accoutrements, Ghost of Monkshood reached into the grab bag and found a banjo, a trumpet, a sax) and one of two things happens-- one, they subjugate craft to pretension and record an unlistenable mess that wants to be hailed as ambitious and challenging, placing the burden on the listener, like here, we recorded the thing, now you figure out how to enjoy it, and don't forget to be smart enough to get it. The other option is that the band makes sure they have actual songs and aren't just deconstructing thin air, like the aforementioned Animal Collective, Architecture in Helsinki, and yep, Ghost of Monkshood. Seventeen tracks is too many for, say, a rock album, which ultimately wants to propel you out of it and into the world, but it's just right for Ghost of Monkshood, whose music encourages staying inside it, and needs the extra time to work its gradual hypnosis.</p><p> <em>Spider Through the Fog</em> immediately immerses you in a rich drone ricocheting between the right and left channels, establishing the limits of the echo chamber the album will ramify within. For the duration, Ghost of Monkshood enliven pillowy analog static and acoustic guitars with flower-child vocals and flickers of vivid detail: There's the weirdly rickety guitar solo on ""I Take It""; the ghost of G-funk whistling through ""Traces of the Cave""; the gnarled cassette-tape-suicide on ""Goddess Hand""; the sudden funk capping ""In the Night""; the busted music box on ""Capsized"". The sweet and the sinister get equal time on <em>Spider Through the Snow</em>, often becoming so blurred as to be indistinguishable, and its to Ghost of Monkshood's credit that the album still comes off as an affable, pleasant surprise, not an endurance test.""</p></div>"|8980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8980-spider-through-the-fog/|7.3|Brian Howe

He builds ridiculously elaborate toys that run on their own silicon-plated gears. Perhaps he starts with something very small, takes it apart, inserts tiny robots, let's them play around awhile until new parts spring up around the old ones. Jackson's melodies might have begun as everyday melodies, but after he's done tinkering, reassembling, and tinkering again, they sound like musical engines, designed not for ease of use but for speed and precision. If his songs were sold individually on store racks, only the richest kids would ever own them, and even then, they'd probably end up in a closet with the junior chemistry set and last year's iPod model. There are a lot of people who will tell you that these kinds of toys are pointless because of their exclusivity and built-in obsolescence. I'd agree that the shelf life of your average glitch-core, robo-pop CD is distressingly short, and wonder if I'll ever see the day when all of the technique that goes into this stuff ever actually produces something ""accessible"".</p><p>
    
    But that's okay if it doesn't: Jackson's debut LP <em>Smash, featuring a dubious ""Computer Band"", is interesting not so much for what it does, but for what it could have done. Two years ago, when he released ""Utopia"", Jackson briefly seemed like the next great hope for IDM, somehow finding a way to balance insanely detailed production with a hook that refused to dislodge itself from many of the electro-heads who heard it. This song had it all: enigmatic intro, expertly crafted beat, spooky background drones and otherworldly female vocal harmonies that even now make me stop what I'm doing to marvel. As <i>Smash</i></em>'s opening track, it sets a pretty high bar for the rest of the record. Unfortunately, in the years since the song's first appearance, Jackson appears to have lost interest in creating tracks like this. Most of the rest of the album is far less ""pretty"" and far more ""impressive"". That is, it's hard to say he isn't progressing as an artist, but even harder to remember a lot of these tunes.</p><p>
    
    The new single ""Rock On"" is an admirable stab at straightforward dance-oriented pop, perhaps the nerdy cousin of Daft Punk's ""Robot Rock"", but trades any melodic momentum for an almost constantly shifting rhythmic base. Snares turn into handclaps, drums fall in and out of the mix, the beat sounds like it's running backwards-- to which Jackson responds by singing wordless falsetto over the top. It's a dizzying experience, but one I'd argue takes a step-and-a-half back for every step-and-a-fourth it moves forward. ""Arpeggio"" is slightly more manageable, mostly due to the semi-consistent beat, and is in fact a pretty good take on Akufen-styled trickery. I might also mention Mouse on Mars, but where the German duo are experts at crafting melodies from the barest hint of actually melodic movement, Jackson usually lets his firework machinery handle things by itself-- there's little quarter given to listeners accustomed to being handed choruses on platters.</p><p>
    
    However, there are signs of genius: ""Hard Tits"" lurches along with a deceptively simple piano figure, doubled by more wordless, heavily reverbed falsetto, that should put Moby out of business once and for all. The overall effect is angelic (similar to parts of ""Utopia"" in that respect), and suggests that he may yet produce music whose complexity not only doesn't overwhelm the vibe, it sends into the stratosphere. Of course, it's preceded by a goth-cinematic track narrated by a little girl (""TV Dogs""), and followed by strained-CPU glam (""Teen Beat Ocean""), so there probably isn't much danger of a crossover soon. And, really, that's fine with me, as is the video game powered ""Tropical Metal. Under all the layers of electronics and broken beats, this is pop: I can put up with haters telling me you can't dance to this stuff as long as Jackson keeps things interesting.</p></div>"|4363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4363-smash/|7.8|Dominique Leone

    could have cranked out, a useless piece of plastic poking a pointy heel in the eye of the carcass of the artist Liz once was.</i></p><p>
    
    Sound familiar?</p><p>
    
    I know I may be in the minority 'round these parts, but I actually like Liz's 2003 self-titled trainwreck.  Yes, it's desperate and
    confused and comes on to you like the mom in <em>American Pie</em>.  For all of those reasons, I find it quite fascinating and
    entertaining, not to mention provocative.  I mean, we're still talking about it, aren't we?  When was the last time you got into
    an argument over Stephan Mathieu &amp; Ekkehard Ehlers' <em>Heroin</em>, which Pitchfork reviewed the same day as <i>Liz Phair,
    and gave an 8.6?  Isn't that why we fell in love with Liz in the first place, because she made us angry and uncomfortable?</i></p><p>
    
    In hindsight, the 0.0 bomb was wasted on that album, because it's much better than <i>Somebody's Miracle</i>.  The chief complaint
    about <i>Liz Phair</i> seemed to be that its rockers were sticky-sweet Matrix-pop at its best-- cheesy, tacky, glamorous, and yes, radio- and
    MTV-friendly.  People complain that ""Extraordinary"" and ""Why Can't I"" are Avril rip-offs, but now that we all agree ""Since U Been Gone"" is a masterpiece, maybe a few more people should rip off Avril.</p><p>
    
    Rather than weather the storm and stick to her guns, Phair eschews her pop fix completely for <i>Somebody's Miracle</i>, an album
    that is ""adult"" in the worst sense  of the word-- the sense that gets ""-alternative"" or ""-contemporary"" tacked onto it by radio
    programmers.  It's not so much ""mature"" as is it safe, nice, settled down.  These songs are perfectly content to get up every
    morning, go to work, come home, eat dinner, watch the news, have 10-minute missionary-position sex, and then fall asleep.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Leap of Innocence"" swaddles the chorus melody of Liz's own ""Polyester Bride"" (from her underrated 1998 album <em>whitechocolatespaceegg</em>)
    in wide, bright heartland-rock chords, as Liz moons over The One That Got Away.  Blah, whatever!  And why does it sound so <i>weird</i>?
    The disconnect between her flat voice (the pitch corrector has clearly been set aside-- she's completely off-key) and the shiny
    production gives the song the feel of an unfinished overdub, something to be scrapped or cleaned up later.  Although, at least it's
    not boring, which is more than can be said for most of the 13 songs that follow.  The title track, ""Count on My Love"", and lead
    single ""Everything to Me"" soak up Sheryl Crow's sun, get lost in John Mayer's wonderland, and oh, how they remind me of Nickelback.
    In fact, so do most of the tracks stinking up the back end of this tedious, over-long calamity.</p><p>
    
    Of course, not everything on <em>Somebody's Miracle</em> sucks like Maroon 5; a few songs suck in other ways.  ""Wind and the Mountain""
    starts out promising, with appealingly vulnerable verses about, appropriately, not living up to expectations, but by the chorus it's
    a self-help serenade, all we're-gonna-get-you-through-this Dr. Phil crap.  ""Stars and Planets"" seems to be making some sort of
    statement about the Big, Bad Music Industry, but the Teletubbies-happy chorus (""We all shine! Shine! Shine! We all shine! Shine!
    Shine!"") and overzealous bounciness of the rhythm make it the kind of earworm that sends people screaming to Wolf Eyes.  ""Table
    for One"" is a trite, oversimplified acoustic lament from the perspective of a doomed alcoholic.  Only someone armed with the pipes
    of Trisha Yearwood and an artillery of Nashville session musicians could save it.</p><p>
    
    There are two decent songs on <em>Somebody's Miracle</em>, and that's why you aren't staring at double zeros once again.  On ""Got My
    Own Thing"", Liz purrs in her best tomboy about how she don't need no stinking true love, since the guy she's got is doing just fine
    for now.  ""Why I Lie"", meanwhile, reaches back to Phair's old slippery sense of melody and penchant for self-deprecation. ""And if
    you ask me why I hurt you/ I don't understand it/ I can't help myself/ It's a special combination/ Of predatory instinct/ And simple
    ill will,"" she sings over a clip-clopping beat and Stones riff, sounding not the least bit apologetic but, frankly, kinda bored.
    Ahh, there's the Liz we know and love.</p><p>
    
    Just as naysayers were quick to blame the Matrix for <em>Liz Phair</em>, it would be all too easy to point fingers at Phair's
    collaborators on <em>Somebody's Miracle</em>-- namely producers John Alagia and John Shanks.  Between them, they've twiddled knobs
    for the Dave Matthews Band, Sheryl Crow, John Mayer, Michelle Branch, and Celine Dion, which explains pretty much everything.
    On the other hand, Shanks has worked with Hilary Duff, Pink, Ashlee Simpson, and Kelly Clarkson, and co-wrote ""Come Clean"", ""Pieces
    of Me"", and ""La La"", so Phair could certainly have chosen to continue experimenting with teen-pop.  Either way, she took the helm,
    and as such, the successes and failures of <i>Somebody's Miracle</i> fall squarely on her shoulders.  Would she really want it any
    other way?</p></div>"|6256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6256-somebodys-miracle/|2.0|Amy Phillips

With Franz Ferdinand|1605.0|Franz Ferdinand|['Rock', 'Electronic']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Domino']|2005-10-02 00:00:00|2005|2016-06-11 20:53:50.205719|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".v5tw65m51c.1.6:0.1.0.$3280/=1$3280.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>You've probably clicked over here to see if the boys in this band could be suffering from any form of second-album slouching. Here's the thing, though: I'm not convinced these boys make albums. Not like that, and not in those terms. Sometimes, when we call an act a ""singles band,"" we mean something cruel and obvious-- that their album tracks just aren't very good. But with Franz Ferdinand, we mean something kinder: that their whole project, their whole system of stylish poses and cocksure guitar stomps, just happens to work better in discrete, surprising, three-minute blasts. It's damned generous of them, really. And like Duran Duran-- the band whose sound these guys spent parts of their first album hybridizing with some vintage Josef K and Monochrome Set post-punk stuff-- chances are they'll continue making solid LPs from which we mostly just cherish and remember the hits.</p><p>That's the report from <em>You Could Have It So Much Better</em>, which does a lot to lock in that M.O. As it turns out, Franz Ferdinand, like many an effective singles band, are immensely more lovable when they're on top of the world. Casual, insouciant greatness is kind of their thing, and these cocky kids seem to have known it from Day One-- just consider ""Take Me Out"", where they spend half a minute pretending to sound like the Strokes before pulping their way down into something much better. And then consider ""Do You Want To"", the lead single from this album. Give these guys the Mercury Prize, and do they sit down fretting about making some kind of serious statement? No, they come back with a big ridiculous stomper, a song whose hooks get so happily ballroom-glam you'd almost think they stole them from the Sweet or the Bay City Rollers-- the kind of song most bands wouldn't be able to pull off without telegraphing a whole lot of irony and embarrassment.</p><p>Couple that with a video in which they dress up in matching outfits, pull faces, and goof, <em>A Hard Day's Night</em>-style, through a gallery full of modern art touchstones, and there's your treat: These guys are evidently having a ball, and they sound good doing it. And they go on sounding like that across the length of this album: gleefully unselfconscious, increasingly glammy and trad-rock, and almost disturbingly amped-up, to the point where most of these songs feel like they're spewing confetti all over themselves, whether you feel like helping or not. Some stretches are packed with so many hooks and effortless swings and shifts and yowls that you might start to ignore them entirely.</p>
<p>People will probably tell you that makes this less of a good album-- a record full of energetic twists and flourishes that don't quite make up for a lack of real, memorable songs. They'll tell you that the interesting things here are the boys' new attempts at bringing down the tempo-- tracks like ""Walk Away"", ""Eleanor Put Your Boots on"", and ""Fade Together"", where the band cribs jaunty moves from <em>Revolver</em>, Paul McCartney, and the Turtles.</p>
<p>The trick is to cede the idea that Franz Ferdinand are meant to deliver the cohesive, moving, traditional Statement Albums their debut may have misled listeners to expect. Some people-- earnest people, like Bloc Party, Sufjan Stevens, and the Arcade Fire-- will go on trying to fill that niche. Franz Ferdinand, though, aren't going to do that, and good on them: We can only hope they'll go on offering us cheeky, energetic surprises. Someday, maybe, they'll score a single as perfect as Pulp's ""Common People"", or pop up with a discoid treat as frothy as Blur's ""Girls and Boys"", but don't count on these guys to keep you supplied with serious close-to-the-heart-on-your-sleeve indie touchstones. Judging by <em>You Could Have It So Much Better</em>, these style-conscious art kids are content to be a fine, entertaining pop band instead.</p>

Who sings like a Pound Puppy while agreeing to     push your bail bonds when cash was tight? Who compresses the entirety of     this year's Fannypack record into one 2:35 track? Who exudes so much offhand     sass she might strip the chrome off your bumper if she parked her ""gifted,     all-natural, and bursting the seams"" keester on it?</p>
<p>Robyn Carlsson gets confused with Robin S of ""Show Me Love"" fame. (Not     helped by the fact that she also had a U.S. top 10 called ""Show Me Love."") But     she's best known for ""Do You Know (What It Takes)"", which also went top 10 over     here in that late-90s moment when anything with a fake r&amp;b; beat and a     sunshine attitude charted as a welcome relief from, like, the Toadies and     stuff. She's disappeared from our radar for the past eight years-- as Euro     pop stars tend to do-- but <i>Robyn</i> is as stupidly ebullient as any     record released this year. ""You wanna rumble in my jungle?/ I'll take you     on/ You wanna rumble in space/ I'll put my laser on stun/ And on the North     Pole/ I'll ice you, son."" Uh-oh!</p>
<p>Over canned synbeats and zaps, she struts her stuff, castigating silly boys     who think they're playing in her weight class and generally acting like the     shit. ""Who's That Girl"" sez ""no, no, no"" like Destiny's Child to     institutionalized sexism-- or something. ""Handle Me"" tells bar star     douchebags with flipped polo shirt collars that she's too much.     Okay, so ""Robot Boy"" is pretty much insufferable, a swerve too sickly for     Radio Disney and kinda creepy when you factor in the songs about coming on     tongues. (Those nails she's sporting on the cover don't look designed for     wiping tears and mending broken hearts.) But ""Be Mine"", which I blathered on     about in the tracks section a few weeks ago, is a disarming     heartbreaker perfectly poised between twee and tuff, like if Pete Wiggs and     Bob Stanley and the Neptunes got trapped in Jeff Goldblum's <i>Fly</i> pods.</p>
<p>""Crash and Burn Girl"" is kiddie disco (I like to imagine the party wreck     she's addressing is Lindsay Lohan, but yr mileage may vary) with added early     Madonna quotes. ""Konichiwa Bitches"" suffers from a bad Dave Chappelle joke     title (not that it'll matter in 10 years), but redeemed by the fact that     it's 2:35 of boasting so compressed you'll rewind it three or four times in     a row. ""Bum Like You"" isn't a ballad, really, but it is slow and acoustic     guitar driven. It's also nice to know that someone out there was willing to     rewrite ""No Scrubs"" with a modicum of humanity granted to the scrubs in     question.</p>
<p>Robyn is already being called ""this year's Annie,"" which is horseshit     because she actually emotes. And unlike the aforementioned Fannypack, she's     got a range beyond ""ripping off L'Trimm."" Her pop fun <i>is</i> a bit     knowing-- she's 26 after all. But trust the Swedes. They know what they're     doing with this sort of thing. Plus it's all over in 35 minutes. If you     think people should be fined for albums over 60 minutes-- is that ballad     really worth it?-- you'll appreciate this.</p></div>"|6949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6949-robyn/|8.2|Jess Harvell

    in fussy textures and not particularly eager to
    please. This means two things: That their New York
    City provenance will raise eyebrows, and that this
    review will be full of awkward synesthetic similes
    (A.S.S. in future mentions).</p><p>
    
    Trouble begins with the first audible event on the
    <em>Cannery Hours</em>'s opener, ""So Far"". It is an
    undulating (A.S.S. #1) tape loop reminiscent of the
    bassy throb that inaugurates <em>Murmur</em>. Instead of
    being abruptly subsumed by more traditional
    percussion, however, the loop is the sole propulsive engine of the song. This is the
    first pleasant surprise in a series.</p><p>
    
    Further listening reveals a band luxuriating in murk
    (A.S.S. #2). Most songs hatch in thin air (A.S.S. #3)
    and build to soupy (A.S.S. #4) density while
    meditating on a recurrent chord progression. This is
    the sound of a democratic, clearly collaborative
    entity: Three of the members rotate on lead-singer
    duty, while background vocals remind one of-- dare I
    say-- the Arcade Fire, not to mention Barrett-era Pink
    Floyd. One member, Sara Shaw, is credited exclusively
    with tape loops, Martin Swope-style, and her
    contribution to the band's sound is hard to
    overestimate.</p><p>
    
    The songs show every sign of being constructed from
    the groove up, but they're songs nonetheless, not
    lava-lamp blobs or invisible-movie soundtracks;
    whether the band like it or not (I'm guessing the
    label does), there are some pop pleasures to be
    gleaned from <em>Cannery Hours</em>, especially the
    shorter numbers like ""Back in Town"". There's only one
    way for a record like this to come to a close,
    however-- with a 10-minute gigantojam-- and the
    Occasion abide: witness the lumbering, eye-rollingly
    titled ""The Maiden"".</p><p>
    
    Coming back to the ""OMG they're from NYC"" ledes the
    Occasion seem to occasion, I'd like to volunteer that
    there is, by now, a distinctive New York scene devoted
    to defiantly genre-less mid-fi psychedelia. Oneida's
    rather brilliant ""The Wedding"" is the best-known
    example so far, but bands like Grizzly Bear and, to
    some extent, the Occasion's Say Hey labelmates Inouk
    are certainly helping carve out this niche. The sound
    of their records seems rooted in rejection of dry
    ProTools perfectionism but isn't mannered or
    reactionary enough to see the hissy boombox stuff as
    an alternative. Instead, they deal in subtle
    dislocation: the electronics wheeze; the loops grate
    lightly against the drums, which are recorded and
    mixed clean but without flamboyance; there's a
    refreshing wobble and ebb of analog drift throughout.</p></div>"|6117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6117-cannery-hours/|7.6|Michael Idov

    to realize when approaching Rhino's ongoing series of ridiculously awesome 
    four-disc compendiums of rock 'n' roll from the fringe of the commercial 
    spectrum. The first two boxes concentrated on the late 1960s, but you'd be 
    hard-pressed to find a signature sound on them, as they embody everything 
    from gut-punch garage rock, blue-eyed soul, and raging proto-punk to frilly 
    gnomes-and-faeries whimsy, mod toughness, and acid-induced nightmares. No, if 
    anything, a Nugget is simply a song that got overlooked in its own era and 
    deserves a second look. The compilation titles talk about psychedelic eras, 
    but they seem to delight in muddying up the very definition of psychedelia, 
    and the third volume of the series, <em>Children of Nuggets</em>, is only too happy 
    to make the terminology harder to pin down.</p><p>
    
    First, calling 1976-1996 the ""Second Psychedelic Era"" is pretty 
    dubious; this music was mostly off the radar during that span and so many 
    other things were happening that it's nearly impossible to wring any kind 
    of narrative out of it. If there's one thing all of these bands 
    had in common, it's that each one of them was responsible for at least 
    one great song. The liner notes try to hold them together like this: ""One 
    characteristic that binds all the groups compiled here was that they looked 
    back to and drew inspiration from earlier times,"" but that merely describes 
    every single recording artist who ever lived, even if a lot of them didn't 
    do it consciously.</p><p>
    
    So what we wind up with after all the semantic wrangling is 100 
    mostly unknown songs by a bunch of artists most people have never heard of, 
    which is, of course, the appeal of the whole enterprise to begin with. It's 
    not going out on a limb to say that by far the most famous song here is 
    ""There She Goes"" by the La's, but no artist is especially famous. The 
    biggest are XTC in their Dukes of Stratosphear guise, the Posies, Primal 
    Scream, the Soft Boys, Flamin' Groovies, Teenage Fanclub, and the 
    Smithereens, some of which are known for music that doesn't fit the overall tone of this set.</p><p>
    
    The Dukes of Stratosphear kick off Disc One with ""Vanishing Girl"", which is 
    the exact opening I would have chosen had I compiled this box. The 
    twinkling guitar intro sets an immediate otherworldly tone, and everything 
    else about this song is perfect: the tight harmonies, melodic bassline, huge 
    chorus. It's been one of my favorite songs since I first heard it years 
    ago, and it's one of the best here. The Dukes-- essentially a front for XTC to indulge their 60s fetish-- are one of several acts well 
    worth exploring beyond their contributions here (they also have a song on 
    Disc Two).</p><p>
    
    There are too many revelatory tracks here to run them all down, but I'll 
    quickly hit a few highlights. The Nashville Ramblers' ""The 
    Trains"" is a gorgeous, heartbreaking piece of melody-drenched 
    guitar pop with a sense of longing and rich darkness that would have done 
    the Zombies proud. The Spongetones give the Hollies a run for it with ""(My 
    Girl) Maryanne"", a big harmony-stuffed song that unfortunately missed the 
    British Invasion boat by a couple of decades. Representing the rougher, more 
    garage-oriented side of things are the Last, whose ""L.A. Explosion"" is a raw 
    guitar grind, and Laika &amp; the Cosmonauts, who turn in a crazy psychedelic 
    surf medley of the themes from <i>Vertigo and <em>Psycho</em>.</i></p><p>
    
    The only genuine scene represented here is L.A.'s mid-80s Paisley 
    Underground, a loose cluster of jangly, melodic bands that drew their 
    inspiration from the Byrds and other American folk-rock. Rain Parade stills 
    sounds vulnerable and heavenly all these years later, while Steve Wynn's 
    Dream Syndicate checks in with ""Tell Me When It's Over"", a song that lets 
    the guitars loose in a house of reverb. The Three O'Clock, Green on Red, and 
    the Bangles (then known as the Bangs) all check in as well, leaving Mazzy 
    Star precursor Opal as the only major scene participant missing in action 
    (apparently, this was due to licensing issues). Another scene that would 
    have been worth exploring is New Zealand's, which centered around the Flying 
    Nun label, but that country only gets one track, in the Chills' ""Pink 
    Frost"". Granted, it's a fantastic track, full of slinky drums and ominous 
    guitars, but New Zealand's South Island was a Nuggets paradise in the 80s, 
    and it's a shame the compilers couldn't get more.</p><p>
    
    If I can geek a little further on the missing material tip, it's telling 
    that compiler Alec Palau laments the absence of the Television Personalities 
    in the liners, because they really ought to be here. My other wishlist bands 
    include 14 Iced Bears, Chameleons, and Cleaners From Venus, but it's tough to 
    fault the final track list too much. I'm also curious if Rhino plans a 
    set that visits the years 1970-1975, which have been left unexplored by all 
    three volumes, outside of a couple stray tracks. They could start with Crabby 
    Appleton's ""Go Back"", end with Spirit's ""Fresh Garbage"", and there'd be 
    plenty to fill the middle with.</p><p>
    
    There's no real guarantee that people who loved the first two Nuggets sets 
    will love this one as well-- the era that Lenny Kaye originally documented had 
    a certain spirit of madcap adventure and experimentation, whereas the 
    rebellion here is often tempered by reverence. Still, it's not a bad bet, 
    and fans of Elephant 6 and modern indie rockers like the 
    Shins and Mazarin will find plenty to love here, while the compilers cite the 
    Strokes and the Hives as ""Grandchildren of Nuggets"". I'd say it's worth the 
    price for any serious of rock 'n' roll nerd in general, lavished as it is 
    with typically extensive liners, pages upon pages of photos and album art, 
    and informative track notes. Who knows where the <em>Nuggets</em> franchise will go 
    next? As long as they keep unearthing mind-blowing songs like the Jigsaw 
    Seen's ""My Name Is Torn"", I'll be listening.</p></div>"|1972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1972-children-of-nuggets-original-artyfacts-from-the-second-psychedelic-era-1976-1996/|8.6|Joe Tangari

    Their musical careers stretch back decades-- Amadou Bagayoko played guitar for
    the legendary Ambassadeurs du Motel de Bamako beginning in the late 1960s. At
    Bamako's Institute for Young Blind People, Bagoyoko met Mariam Doumbia, and
    the pair forged two parallel partnerships, one in marriage and the other in
    music. Their parents approved of neither. They began their recording career
    in the 1980s the way so many other African artists have-- traveling hundreds
    of miles to Abidjan in Cote D'Ivoire, which until recently was one of the
    cultural and economic centers of Francophone West Africa, to make cassettes
    and perform. Within a decade, they were playing in Europe and cutting all
    kinds of new influences into their sound, from Cuban son and horn-spiked
    funk to reggae and Delta blues, and Western labels were giving them the
    compilation treatment. Now, with <em>Dimanche à Bamako</em>, the blind couple from
    Mali seems well-poised to make a huge splash, though it's likely that the
    mainstream attention they get in the rest of the world will far outpace what
    they get in the U.S.</p><p>
    For <em>Dimanche</em>, the duo and their backing band brought in Manu Chao, a world
    music superstar famous just about everywhere outside of the United States, and
    the dividend is a varied, bright, and charming album. While Chao's beat-conscious eclecticism makes this Amadou &amp; Mariam's most accessible
    album (to Western ears, that is), it also comes at the expense of some of
    the organic directness of their past records. Still, that's more than made
    up for by the incredible style salad they've dreamed up, one which Chao's
    airy production and love of field recordings holds together quite well.</p><p>
    In fact, you might hear something like this album driving through the
    streets of Bamako with the windows open, the way snatches of street noise,
    sirens, and voices drift through. Both Amadou &amp; Mariam sing (Chao's voice is
    everywhere as well), and they're both restrained, smooth vocalists,
    especially compared to some of Mali's biggest stars, Salif Keita
    and Mory Kante. As such, this probably makes them more suited to chunky r&amp;b;
    and Western pop than their countrymen, and indeed, were it sung in English, Amadou's thrilling
    descending chorus on ""Politic Amagni"" sounds like something you might hear
    blasting from a car at an American stoplight.</p><p>
    As pleasing as his voice is, Amadou's real talent is
    reserved for the guitar, an instrument he plays with supple, liquid skill.
    He reels off roiling lines and droning desert blues with graceful dexterity,
    reflecting influences as wide-ranging as Bembeya Jazz's Sekou Diabate,
    Robert Johnson, and Saharan guitar and oud music. Opener ""M'bife"" proceeds in two parts, the first being the
    proper song, featuring Mariam's starkly unadorned voice over male harmonies,
    percussion and strummed guitar; the second is a buoyant, thumping
    instrumental that intertwines rhythmic guitar interplay with tumbling
    balafon, a West African marimba with a slightly sharper sound than the
    marimbas we're used to.</p><p>
    Single ""Coulibaly"" layers male/female harmonies and bluesy guitar licks over
    a dense foundation of swirling rhythm guitars and clattering percussion,
    while ""La Realite"" brims with siren samples and off-beat organ. ""La Fete au
    Vilage"" sounds ancient by comparison with its modal guitar and traded
    verses, though granted it's unlikely that tablas could have made it into the
    background of a Malian folk song prior to the last few decades. Mariam
    flirts briefly with rap on ""Camions Sauvages"", coming halfway between it and
    Indian rhythm exercises, and the track highlights how important raw kinetic
    energy is to the album with an insistent beat framed by Amadou's slow,
    surf-y strumming.</p><p>
    The album spends a full hour swinging from strength to strength, and by the
    time it's over, it's clear that it would be a crime if it didn't rocket
    Amadou &amp; Mariam straight to stardom. It's a shame that in the U.S. it's likely
    to be smooshed into the world music ghetto, because it demonstrates as well
    as any recent release just how meaningless the world music tag is-- if
    anything, it proves that music is perfectly capable of wandering right past
    borders and across oceans and teaching us that for all of our perceived

It quickly
    drops away to just Annie Hardy's innocent voice over a simple drumbeat and sunny synthesizer bass. From this, you probably wouldn't guess that Giant Drag has just two members, singer and guitarist Hardy and drummer Micah Calabrese. Calabrese's left hand should get a third of the credit, triggering the programmed bass that somehow becomes the glue holding together ""Kevin Is Gay"" and later the kiss-off anthem ""This Isn't it"", among others.</p><p>
    
    ""Kevin Is Gay"" ends with Hardy singing the melody with ""meow"" in place of every word, and segues into multi-tracked studio banter where she demands with uncontainable glee to hear the song played back. ""Cordial Invitation"", reprised from the group's consistently overdriven <em>Lemona</em> EP, gains a fleshed-out arrangement, recast here as demure acoustic pop. ""This Isn't It"" is another track recycled from Lemona, as is ""yflmd"". ""This Isn't It"" is just as inviting as the earlier version, giving the spotlight to Hardy's voice and Micah's hand during the verses, until three distinct chords in the chorus deflate all the momentum, as if Hardy's stopping the car to give someone an added awkward goodbye from the driver's window. ""yflmd"" retains a snaky guitar line that sounds like <em>To Bring You My Love</em>-era PJ Harvey, with come-hither lyrics that get a little creepier with context. (The song title is an acronym for ""you fuck like my dad."") What's more memorable than the psycho promiscuity the title suggests is Hardy's countermelody on guitar that takes us to the chorus (""You're just like my father."")</p><p>
    
    ""High Friends in Places"" treads the same ground-- man-eating promises over cantankerous swells of guitar (""One wasn't clean/ One wasn't man enough for me""). There's moments when they vary the approach, adding horns to the swaying rhythm of ""Blunt Picket Fence"" and creeping electronic tones to ""Smashing"". By and large, the two-man formula is stretched for all its worth, though the bouncy ""You're Full of Shit (Check Out My Sweet Riffs)"" or the strong vocals of ""My Dick Sux"" transcend Giant Drag's simple formula. </p><p>
    
    All these silly song titles and nearly frightening studio patter scratch the surface of something, the way the snippets on a record like <em>Surfer Rosa</em> add another layer of inscrutability, but monochromatic guitars overwhelm the album and mute the few moments of quirk. The two gems here are the bored kiss-off ""This Isn't it"" and the effortless ""Slayer"", which closes the album. Hardy softly murmurs the melody, sliding through a riff with a pristine guitar tone over the gentle 4/4 thump of the bass drum, adding the barest back-up harmony. Yes, Giant Drag sound good with the guitars cranked to 11, but they sound great when they're barely trying. If you make it through the maniacal bonus tracks, you might get the feeling I did: That Hardy could be a far more interesting frontperson than <em>Hearts and Unicorns</em> lets on.</p></div>"|3685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3685-hearts-and-unicorns/|6.8|Jason Crock

A prominent figure in turntablism for the past decade, Spooky has remixed Nick Cave, Metallica, and a score of others, and he's worked with a wide range of hip-hop and indie rock's biggest stars. For his 2004 release <em>Celestial Mechanix: The Blue Series Mastermix</em>, he fused jazz and hip-hop, remixing tracks from selections from Thirsy Ear's Blue Series. Now, a year later, he's teamed up with thrash metal legend Dave Lombardo, most famous for his work with Slayer, but also skin-pounder for Fantômas, Grip, Inc., and one-time member of Testament. As if that pair wasn't odd enough, also along for the ride are Public Enemy mouth-piece Chuck D, Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid, and Meat Beat Manifesto's Jack Dangers. The result is the appropriately titled <em>Drums of Death</em>.</p><p>
    The tracks are pretty evenly split between frenetic, drum-heavy instrumentals and guitar-driven hip-hop. The hip-hop songs are the stronger, especially ""Assisted Suicide"", which features Dälek. The three other hip-hop tracks here are Public Enemy remakes: ""Brother's Gonna Work it Out"", ""B-Side Wins Again"", and ""Public Enemy #1"", all of which are beefed up by Lombardo's mechanical throb and crunchy guitar work from Reid and Dangers. The slice-and-dice beats and throbbing guitar are a perfect match for Chuck D's seething vocal delivery. Luckily, DJ Spooky's spinning and Dangers' production keep all of these tracks from coming off like so many failed, meatheaded rap-metal hybrids. These are hip-hop songs first and foremost, with the rock elements used along with samples and keyboards to create texture beneath the lyrical attack.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the instrumentals aren't as interesting. Lombardo's drumming is always impressive, but on many of these tracks it's the only thing that stands out. Of the instrumentals, ""Kultur Krieg"" and ""Terra Nulius (Cyborg Rebellion on Colony Planet Zyklon 15)"" are generic thrash metal with tinny production. The jazzier, illbient tracks, such as ""Metatron"" and ""A Darker Shade of Bleak"" are a little more inspired, but they still don't offer quite enough creative ideas to push them to the front. </p><p>
    The exception is ""Incipit Zarathustra"", which mixes Lombardo's aforementioned lightening-fast drumming with Spooky's equally impressive turntable skills, mixing in samples from, among other things, the Beastie Boys and Atari games. It's the perfect outlet for both of their talents, which they're both clearly overflowing with. As one of the more compelling songs in this collection, ""Incipit Zarathustra"" just goes to show how unfortunate it is that <em>Drums of Death</em> is so uneven. </p></div>"|2388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2388-drums-of-death/|6.0|Cory D.

Painstakingly detail-oriented and lyrically dense, the record is another labor of love that puts as much emphasis on the labor as on the love. With an ambitious expanse that falls somewhere between the eclectic sprawl of 2000's <em>Nia</em> and the more-streamlined funk of 2002's <i>Blazing Arrow, it appears as if every square inch of <em>The Craft</em> has been fussed over to such an extent that Blackalicious's calculated risks and controlled experiments can sometimes make the album seem more science project than artwork.</i></p><p>
    Following the release of <em>Blazing Arrow</em>, both group members spent time with other projects-- Gift of Gab with his 2004 solo album <i>4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up</i> and Xcel with his underappreciated Lateef and the Chief collaboration <em>Maroons: Ambush</em>. And evidently this time apart allowed the two to approach their partnership rejuvenated and ready for some serious woodshedding, as they reportedly recorded dozens of tracks before pruning down to these relatively lean 14 songs. Despite this strenuous editing process, however, <em>The Craft</em> can remain a frustratingly uneven listen. Brimming with confidence, the duo plows through ideas both familiar and novel. Fans of the group's previous work-- and of Solesides/Quannum-related material in general-- will find treats within <em>The Craft</em>'s many folds, but its irregular terrain will likely prevent consensus about which tracks represent the peaks and which the troughs.</p><p>
    The most noteworthy change to Blackalicious' sound is a pronounced increase of live instrumentation. On paper, the extensive use of live drums, guitars, and strings might seem a nod toward creating more conventional songs, but in practice this blend has unquestionably resulted in some of the weirdest tracks of the group's career. Xcel integrates the instruments so seamlessly into his samples that it's often difficult to pinpoint what's what. On opener ""World of Vibrations"" the mix segues abruptly from the song's daffy, almost Joe Meek-like chorus into a sultry breakdown of rippling guitars, impassioned female vocals, and shimmering dub effects; it's an interlude as beguiling as it is unexpected.</p><p>
    Much more straightforward is ""Powers"", the album's effervescent first single. With its bouncy layers of new-wave guitars, strange Manfred Mann keyboards, and Go! Team exclamations, this track resembles an outtake from a failed hip-hop Broadway revue, but is salvaged by Gift's adroit melodic work on the verses and Xcel's rubber-limbed production. Even better are adventurous tracks like ""Side to Side"", which features Lateef and Pigeon John exchanging verses with Gift of Gab over a loony, oboe-fed sway, the unrelenting pound of ""Egosonic War Drums"", or the bracing prison reform drama ""The Fall and Rise of Elliott Brown"", which is fortified by Xcel's well-doctored horn samples.</p><p>
    Throughout the album Gift of Gab showcases his still-astonishing verbal dexterity and enunciation, chiseling every syllable into the pavement despite rarely breaking from a full sprint. But if you've tired of his ""I still think abstract/ Stay metaphysical/ And challenge what is really real"" act in the past, it's unlikely that anything here will alter your viewpoint, particularly on tracks like ""Rhythm Sticks"" where he resorts to the tired riff of spelling out the name Blackalicious. (""...A is for the absolute that dwells everywhere you can't see/ C is for creating..."") Such missteps aside, Gabby is at his most persuasive when he slows down a bit and lets the game come to him, especially on autobiographical numbers like ""My Pen &amp; Pad"" or the set-closing title track. And though these numbers must overcome some threadbare ""This ain't music, it's my life"" clichés, there can be little doubting the emotional heft in Gift's delivery, or in the inspired connections that Blackalicious manage to discover whenever they're hard at work together.</p></div>"|788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/788-the-craft/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

    When we first met singer/guitarist Ivan Howard and keyboardist/vocalist Kelly Crisp, they were blowing peppy power-pop smooches to each other on <em>Make Out</em>, gagging the cynical and wooing the goo-goo-eyed with Pixie Stix hooks and lyrics like ""First time I kissed you, I almost died."" Their outlook wasn't completely, err, rosy-- there were songs about sad drunks and a few hints of heartbreak-- but it was clear that this was a married couple utterly enthralled with their Big, Big Love.</p><p>
    
    There's nothing wrong with Big, Big Love, or Pixie Stix hooks, but the Rosebuds weren't particularly good at either. Thankfully, their second full-length, <em>Birds Make Good Neighbors</em>, is a dark, disconcerting record that derives its power from restraint. It's Southern gothic through the filter of Ernest Hemingway, with the frightening stuff left off the page but seeping between the lines. There's a lot of love in these songs, but it's love in the face of a common enemy. </p><p>
    
    ""And we'll get by/ And we tell ourselves one more time/ We get by/ And we brace ourselves and hold our hands and fight,"" Howard sings on the opening song, ""Hold Hands and Fight"". But it isn't a triumphant vow or some kind of pep talk. The music is ominous, with piano, tambourine, and stand-up bass throbbing quietly, haltingly. Howard's voice wobbles, slipping between notes. When the chorus swoops in with a gang of muted oohs and whoas, it sounds like the Arcade Fire, if the Arcade Fire were very, very scared. </p><p>
    
    ""Hold Hands and Fight"" sets the template for most of the 10 tracks that follow. ""Boxcar"" imagines childhood fantasies of escape over an understated acoustic railroad chug. ""We could make a broom of weeds and brush and sweep all the daddies away,"" Howard moans, teetering on the edge of a Morrissey croon. Crisp's la-la-las on the chorus are instantly catchy, but far from sweet. Howard and Crisp play lovers separated by oceans and time in ""Leaves Do Fall"", eventually resolving to die rather than wait to be reunited. Teenagers hold each other close in the sanctuary of the garage in ""Wildcat"", as a family fight rages on inside the house. ""Blue Bird"" longs for the country from inside the city; ""Outnumbered"" awaits certain doom over surf-guitar jangle. </p><p>
    
    These songs are infused with a hint of twangy menace, bubbling under but never exploding. The Rosebuds avoid the easy, melodramatic path, instead opting for subdued delivery and an atmosphere of uncomfortable tension. But it's uncomfortable in a good way. When they fall back on the lovey-dovey stuff on the call-and-response group sing-along ""Shake Our Tree"" and the sappy pledge of devotion ""Warm Where You Lay"", the album falters. Who put this chick flick in my psychological thriller? </p><p>
    
    Perhaps <em>Birds</em>' shadowy sound signals the end of the honeymoon period of the Crisp/Howard marriage, and the beginning of facing the problems of a long-term relationship. But if they sound this good now, man, I can't <em>wait</em> until they get divorced. </p></div>"|6891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6891-birds-make-good-neighbors/|8.1|Amy Phillips

Hawley himself, former touring guitarist for Pulp and member of the second-tier Britpop band Longpigs, is forthcoming about his music's origins. His influences are not only on his sleeve, they're reflected in his tour schedule and his choice of collaborators. Yes, he sounds like he's listened to a lot of Lee Hazlewood; he's also opening for Nancy Sinatra at a number of dates in England. And not only is the Scott Walker connection undeniable, Hawley has spent time in the studio with the man himself after meeting initially through the Pulp connection.</p><p>
<em>Coles Corner</em> is Hawley's third full-length, and it finds him further refining his sound. His voice is richer and the arrangements have an extra smidge of polish. The songs are remarkably clear and direct, trading almost exclusively in familiar couplets that have become part of western pop currency. ""Hold back the night"" is the first line of the opening title track, and the chorus begins ""Going downtown where there's music/ Going where voices fill the air."" It's rarely difficult to pick out the next line. Yes, it's tears Hawley is talking about in ""Just Like the Rain"". The countrypolitan ballad ""Wait for Me"" seems plucked from another epoch: ""So think of me when you feel that moon,"" Hawley croons, ""oh it calls to me, as it calls to you."" First time through you might want to stop and say, Hold up, there's still a moon? I thought it fell from the sky somewhere in the early 70s.</p><p>
    
    Yes, the moon is still up there, and <em>Coles Corner</em> is unapologetically retro to the max but it works. Hawley's style, his sturdy baritone singing songs that combine hints of country with pre-rock pop and orchestral flourishes overlaid with healthy dollop of reverb, has a robust appeal. It translates in 2005 because this corner of music was always about nostalgia and taut drama constructed with tightly circumscribed language. Hawley resides deep inside this material, writing songs with the melodic muscle to stand up next to standards. You can make a case against cultural recycling, but you can't argue away the emotional impact of the orchestral build on ""The Ocean"". As he describes a scene on a gray desolate beach where one imagines every day is like Sunday, new instruments are added bar-by-bar until and the tension is ratcheted up to the breaking point. With the tape saturated at the climax Hawley lets loose with a booming ""Here comes the rain!"" Pity the realist who reaches for the umbrella.</p><p>
    
    The closing piano instrumental ""Last Orders"" is a cover that nicely punctuates how and why Hawley got here. It's played on an upright with the sustain pedal to the floor inside an empty cavern of a room. As the tune progresses the echo around the piano mixes with a dusty cloud of Eno-esque electronic treatment, the first time on the record we hear a sound that couldn't have been reproduced in the early '60s. Then finally the keyboard drops out completely to close with two minutes of a golden, light-speckled drone of aching poignancy. It's then you realize that Hawley's music can go wherever he wants it to go. He's not stuck in the past. He inhabits his record collection because he likes it there and has a feeling we will too. He's right.</p></div>"|4023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4023-coles-corner/|8.1|Mark Richardson

Before the Enlightenment freed beauty from the dim hedge-maze of superstition and ushered it into the pure light of empiricism; before aesthetics became a valid mode of philosophical inquiry that favored beauty's mundane qualities over its divine ones; before post-structuralism wrought violence on binary values; an object's beauty was inextricably linked to its internal harmony of structure and function and its external harmony with the natural world. In other words, anything beautiful had to mirror divine creation, not subjective human values.</p><p>
    
    Here in 2005, beauty remains under siege-- it's the new boring; it's all tied into hidden power structures; it's hard to dance to and resists innovation-- yet the concept of beauty, and our perception of it, persists. No matter how abstracted and censured it becomes, few would deny that, say, the oceans are beautiful. In a musical climate where beauty is often disregarded or located in asymmetrical euphony, bands like Kepler are clinging to an older and more concrete conception of beauty-- one that hinges on order, balance, and tradition. Like its namesake, the Canadian ex-slowcore (now just songcore) troupe arrays celestial happenings in elegant orbits, making songs that fit perfectly into circles like Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.</p><p>
    
    If you replace ""slowcore"" with ""post-rock"" in Kepler's biography, the band's trajectory is parallel with Karate's (if compressed): <em>Attic Salt</em> is analagous to <em>Pockets</em> in its basic sonics and its triumphant, post-deconstructive lucidity. Here's ""Broken Bottles, Blackened Hearts"", a stately tide of lambent piano chords, lush reverb, and hushed cymbals ebbing and flowing below Samir Khan's tweedy (Jeff Tweedy, that is) vocals. Here's ""The Bedside Manner"", loping with the graceful yet muscular fluidity of a trotting horse. And here's ""Rented Limosine"", with arpeggios refracting through lapidary percussion like light through a prism. Here's an album that locates its force in its artisanal skill, not in its theoretical or innovative dimensions, and if it's not a dying breed, it's certainly an endangered one. </p><p>
    
    This is not a call for art to return to Middle Age, or even neo-classical, values-- I place a high premium on art's capacity for innovation and social commentary. Rather, it is a call for a reassessment of the value of beauty, disabused of Judeo-Christian overtones but in full possession of its divine symmetry, at a time when its cultural relevance is dwindling. To reject the beauty of order is to reject the natural world. At the end of the day, Kepler's music <em>is</em> beautiful, like the sea is beautiful, and while we might not know exactly what this means, to disregard it wholesale as a biased cultural construct is to throw out the baby <em>and</em> the bath. It is also a deep loss to another confounding yet lasting, embarassing abstraction: The human spirit. </p></div>"|4404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4404-attic-salt/|7.6|Brian Howe

As Broken Spindles, Faint bassist Joel Petersen follows the tangent from his initial band's sepulchral new wave sound, coating it with a thick industrial sludge and fractured IDM. Nihilistic lyrics complete the equation, and Petersen's absolutely soulless delivery solidifies his status as Saddle Creek's answer to Trent Reznor. However, while the Faint were one of the main progenitors for today's new wave reincarnation, Broken Spindles merely rehashes staples of the not-so-distant past (NIN, Prodigy) with one eye on today's trendier acts (Kid 606, Casiotone for the Painfully Alone), the latter of which appearing too frequently for comfort on <em>Inside/Absent</em>.</p><p>
    
    Petersen further dissociates himself from the Faint on his third album, as a first listen reveals the lack of guitar and drum parts, with a second revealing there ain't much bass left either. Horror movie piano lines team with ubiquitous blips and bleeps to constitute most of the sonic landscape here, mirroring the Petersen's stark, dehumanized vocals. On instrumental opener ""Inward"", Petersen plays the role of musician gone mad a bit too convincingly, steering through unstable fugues and OCD key pounding. Brief vignettes ""Desaturated"" and ""Valentine"" follow suit, sounding like xeroxed continuations.</p><p>
    
    Of course, you're probably not interested in instrumentation, you just wanna hear about the intimate scene acted out by those weird dolls on the album cover. As part three of Broken Spindles' ""Trapped in the Closet""-esque series, Petersen tackles a topic ripe with disillusionment and dismay--love and relationships. ""Burn My Body"" features the album's lone guitar, showcasing the same angular riffs that makes the Faint's early material worth revisiting. Unfortunately, Petersen's masochistic lyrics reminds us why we should focus strictly on the music: ""Burn my body/ I'm taking up space/ Burn and mix me with plaster or paint."" The misanthropic sap thickens on humming laptop anti-ballad ""Anniversary"", with Petersen pining ""Counting our anniversaries/ Like they're a record of worth"" over a minimalist arrangement.</p><p>
    
    Although such bleak production means an over-emphasis on the gauche lyrics,  it amplifies Petersen's bread and butter--creating an utterly depressing, spirit-sucking atmosphere. Despite the malaise, Petersen still proves somewhat dynamic--even playful at times--on the album's catchier numbers. ""Please Don't Remember This"" shares <em>The Downward Spiral</em>'s demented take on dance music while ""The Distance Is Nearsighted"" recalls Cex's droning vocals and skittish beats. Although not entirely original or groundbreaking, Petersen molds a more definite sound for Broken Spindles, one that's not simply electro-Faint or NIN lite. Problem is, now that Broken Spindles is legit, what's next? <em>Inside/Absent</em> is a nice listen, but doesn't hint at anything greater to come-- a frustrating flaw for an album already unexcited with itself.</p></div>"|11687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11687-insideabsent/|7.0|Adam Moerder

In the last year he's survived an aneurysm and a greatest hits album. So why hasn't the man started to sound old? Sure, his voice quavers on some of the high notes on his ambitious new album, <em>Prairie Wind</em>, but he sounds remarkably preserved, showing the same age and wear he's shown for years: That voice-- alternately gentle and strident, tender and outraged-- has held up surprisingly well, gaining gritty authority with age. His few cracks and wrinkles just reinforce the sense of wistful nostalgia that suffuses <em>Prairie Wind</em> as well as almost all his other folk-rock albums since <i>Harvest Moon, if not since </i><i>Harvest.</i></p><p>
    
    Young has made this sort of no-surprises reliability a virtue. He long ago set the templates for his music, and while he's known for his itchy restlessness, late in his career he doesn't stray from that comfortable sound. The scope of his albums grows immodestly-- his previous, <em>Greendale</em>, was even accompanied by a film-- but his music, whether time-capsule folk like <em>Prairie Wind</em> or ragged-glory rock, remains the same size, exhibiting his confidence that a small voice can address enormous issues on a personal level. That constancy can be consoling, despite the themes of loss that haunts his songs.</p><p>
    
    There's something proudly old-fashioned about <em>Prairie Wind</em>, specifically in its simple visions of America, as in the title track's central image of a farmer's wife hanging laundry in the backyard. Even the title itself hopes for the possibility of more American frontiers, a new home on the range instead of a McMansion in the 'burbs. In other words, Young's concerns are deeply buried in the past, in a vision of history that seems simpler than the present. To his credit, he isn't another 1960s boomer insisting that everything was better back then, man-- his music hasn't changed that dramatically. There are a few moments of fuzzy nostalgia, as on ""He Was the King"", which takes liberties with Elvis's legendary exploits. But does anybody need to be reminded of Elvis's popularity when the same old songs are repackaged every holiday season? Or is that Young's point?</p><p>
    
    Still, <em>Prairie Wind</em> is best when Young indulges personal reminiscences, as on ""Far From Home"", which starts with a fond memory: ""When I was a growing boy rockin' on my daddy's knee/ Daddy took an old guitar and sang 'Bury me on the lone prairie.'"" Young's dad appears again on the title track, and a less earthly father appears on ""When God Made Me"". ""This Old Guitar"" reminisces over his long career, and on the album opener, ""The Painter"", he nods to old friends who are either long gone or still hanging around for another album. Several of the musicians on <i>Prairie Wind have played with Young many times before, including keyboard player Spooner Oldham, guitarist Ben Keith, bassist Rick Rosas, and Emmylou Harris. For such a seasoned band, though, they sound maybe a little too familiar: They tend to let the songs drag out, clocking in at five, six, or even seven minutes (the tiring title track) when three would work just fine. </i></p><p>
    
    Intermingled with these private memories are larger concerns about Bush-era America, across which a cold prairie wind apparently blows. Yet Young's music is so rooted in the past, specifically the spirit of the 60s, that his stabs at contemporary relevance sound awkward and even curmudgeonly, as on ""No Wonder"" when he refers to ""America the Beautiful"" as ""that song from 9/11"" and quotes Chris Rock. <em>Prairie Wind</em> tries to gauge the present via the past, but there's a profound disconnect. But maybe Young is aware of it: ""I try to tell the people,"" he sings on the title track, ""But they never hear a word I say/ They say there's nothin' out there but wheat field anyway."" He sounds pretty frustrated, but <em>Prairie Wind</em> mostly is frustrating.</p></div>"|8855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8855-prairie-wind/|5.8|Stephen M. Deusner

Because there's a fight going on-- a fight over who constituted the ""real"" alternative audience of the 1980s-- and I'm making it my responsibility to put you on the right side of the thing.</p><p>
    To get a sense of the battle lines, just listen to the Dead Milkmen's ""Instant Club Hit"" (1987), a fake dance track in which a band of American punk pranksters take their shots at goths, ""art fags,"" ""boring bisexuals,"" and ""Danceateria types"": ""You'll dance to anything by the Smiths/ You'll dance to anything by Depeche Commode [sic]."" One of few things funnier than this song is the fact that the stuff inside it is still at issue. Poke around, and you'll find plenty of people who'll tell you that the real, important music of the 1980s came from bug-eyed Californian punks (like Black Flag), beer-friendly Midwestern rockers (like Hüsker Dü), and D.C. hardcore kids (like Minor Threat); that major labels did nothing but ruin greedy bands (like the Replacements); that make-up, synthesizers, and the Milkmen's ""stupid Europeans with big hairdos"" didn't matter and/or exist; and that singer-songwriters, ""rootsy"" music, and adult pop were a million miles away.</p><p>
    In the opposite camp, you'll find clear-eyed realists with actual memories, who'll happily admit that as of the mid-80s plenty of well-informed people really liked R.E.M. and Suzanne Vega.</p><p>
    Both of these groups can be right, in the end, but notice how much the first of them relies on selective memory? Every time they talk about the ""real underground"" or nitpick about which bands were on truly independent labels, what they're really doing is writing off those who genuinely liked 10,000 Maniacs or Echo &amp; the Bunnymen-- the equivalent of someone, 20 years from now, pretending that this decade was all about Wolf Eyes and Lightning Bolt, and nobody listened to Feist, or Annie, or Radiohead. Here's the truth: If you flipped on your local college radio station toward the close of the 80s, chances are you'd hear all of this stuff, jumbled together-- Milkmen and Minutemen, Ministry and Morrissey, plus Edie Brickell to boot. Arguing about which 80s breeds were important and which were merely incidental forgets the sheer variety of stuff that got thrown into the not-quite-mainstream fold.</p><p>
    And what's bizarre is this: Even in our current climate, where mp3 trading has supposedly made it so that everyone is pop-friendly, fun-loving, non-rockist, and open-eared, the Real Underground Music camp still seems to be winning this argument.</p><p>
    Why this matters: Because Seymour Stein's Sire Records, an imprint founded in 1966 and folded into Warner Bros a decade later, was a pretty major source of the quirky, often-accessible, sometimes-popular ""college rock"" the Undergrounders are so keen on telling you they paid no attention to-- and this box collects three CDs and one video disc of the label's peak-era highlights. As a corrective to some people's critical histories, it's a joy. Better still: If I were rating this collection based on the pure quality of the music it contains, as opposed to a whole bunch of considerations about your time and your money, it'd be up there in the eights.</p><p>
    Sire's catalog spent most of its time straddling the lines of stylish, accessible pop and acts just a little too different to push at the mainstream. Stein was attuned to New York City punk (Ramones, Richard Hell), and even more so to its new-wave trajectory (Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club, Kid Creole). He picked winners from cross-Atlantic new wave (Rezillos, Plastic Bertrand), and followed synth-pop from its grotty start (Telex, the Normal) to its stupid-European-big-hair heyday (Erasure, Pet Shop Boys, Soft Cell). Across the length of the 80s, Stein's Sire played the same role Geffen's DGC played for the 90s, rounding up the popular, accessible end of America's college-rock guitar bands (Dinosaur Jr, the Replacements, the Ocean Blue) and-- maybe more importantly-- licensing the rest from the UK (Cure, Smiths, and Bunnymen), to the point where the 1990 edition of their <em>Just Say...</em> samplers managed to import early tastes of My Bloody Valentine's ""Soon"" <em>and</em> Primal Scream's ""Higher Than the Sun"". And Sire also served as a home for adult, mainstream-y pop acts whose sounds or personas scared everyone else off, such as k.d. lang or Israeli icon Ofra Haza.</p><p>
    What does this mean? It means that instead of the straight-line history of Important Underground Bands, this box offers something that looks more like what some of your 1977-1993 analogs might really have been paying attention to. Like the Pretenders, pop godfathers of the ""college"" audience. Like synth-pop, or like 2-Tone-ish cuts from Madness and the English Beat. Like Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, back when ""rootsy"" music was considered polite and adult and niche-marketed, instead of being touted as progressive. Like fresh or just plain lovable pop singles: Seal's futurist ""Crazy"", Modern English's ""I Melt with You"", and the Cult's ""Fire Woman"" (or the Farm's ""Groovy Train,"" more for nostalgia than quality). Like Brian Wilson and Lou Reed, popular figures important to the ""underground"" in the same studied way they are today. Like the Rezillos' ""Top of the Pops"", the most gleefully spiky new-punk single ever not-released by the Buzzcocks, or Aztec Camera's ""Oblivious"", the distilled core of the kind of pretty 1980s British guitar-pop your Black Flag fans would spit on. And, this era marking the birth of the music video, a full disc of those-- from M's ""Pop Muzik"" to the Replacements <em>and</em> Madonna to Belly and Aphex Twin.</p><p>
    Now look: I don't necessarily fault the Undergrounders. All they're really trying to do is narrow their critical history down to talk about the ""important"" things that happened in the underground, the things that really changed. They can leave it to pop writers to talk about synthesizers and ""traditional"" guitar bands-- and the slurs they'd have thrown at those types are certainly true for some of the acts here, from the Mighty Lemon Drops to Martini Ranch. Maybe it really isn't so important to talk about a singer-songwriter like Suzanne Vega when people today will just pick up Keren Ann records doing the exact same thing. But in that process of narrowing everything down, the first victim is, well, reality-- and any hope of talking seriously about the actual music culture of people who were probably a lot like you. Twenty years from now, when someone's going on about the underground of the oughts, some of you may need to step forward and let it be known: A lot of you really like the Arcade Fire, too. A lot of you really like the Decemberists, M.I.A., Devendra Banhart, Madvillain, Antony &amp; the Johnsons, the Fiery Furnaces, Basement Jaxx, and whatever other acts the future writes off as conventional or popular in the interest of its Grand Narrative of Music Going Forward. Their narrative may be ""right"" and ""important,"" but yours will be ""true,"" and therefore probably ""more interesting.""</p></div>"|2099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2099-just-say-sire/|6.7|Nitsuh Abebe

Sure, it has two of the founding members, Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens, and it has two touring members, Jonathan Auer and Ken Stringfellow of the Posies. Sure, that's the same line-up that played on Big Star's last release, <em>Columbia: Live at Missouri University 4/25/93</em>, and that's the same line-up that's been touring on and off for years as Big Star. They've remained Big Star longer than any other of the other incarnations, but judging from the band's first album of new material-- the first bearing the name Big Star in nearly 30 years-- they sound more like the countless Big Star followers than Big Star.</p><p>Band names are essentially brand names, especially in the case of Big Star, which took its moniker from a regional chain of grocery stores. That choice proved ironic: Despite critical acclaim and best efforts, the band never achieved any sort of stardom, but instead gradually became cult kings. For a band like Big Star to release a new album of original material 30 years after what most believed was their last is a calculated risk: It's sure to get people's attention, but it also threatens to devalue the brand.</p><p> <em>In Space</em> isn't as terrible as internet chatter predicted. In fact, it's not really bad at all, even though it starts off aggressively mediocre. The opener ""Dony"" has Jim Spake's out-of-nowhere sax solo to enliven its midtempo pop, but Auer and Stringfellow's ""Lady Sweet"" and Stephens' ""Best Chance We've Ever Had"" lack any such flourish. ""Turn My Back on the Sun"" starts with a Beach Boys fake-out-- a toy piano melody and the words ""Wouldn't it..."", but ""be nice"" is replaced with ""surprise somebody to find."" That's the lyrical highlight of <em>In Space</em>. Most other songs are full of banal sentiments (""the sunlight in your hair seems to stop time""), hoary cliches (""Lady Sweet/ Looks like she can't be beat""), and simplistic rhyme schemes. The band sounds hesitant and maybe uncommitted, and instead of conveying feelings, these first songs reveal a lack of ideas, suggesting that Big Star don't have much to say.</p><p>  It's not until ""Love Revolution"" that <em>In Space</em> begins to pick up a little. The song is so silly it's almost embarrassing-- a disco-lite anthem with shout-outs for all-night lovemaking and platform shoes. But at least it sounds like they're having fun. It kicks off a middle section that's a lively and energetic remedy to the songs that precede it. Stephens' ""February's Quiet"" is no revelation, but it's a sweet ode to making it through the cold months with the one you love. ""A Whole New Thing"", ""Do You Wanna Make It"", and their cover of the Olympics' ""Mine Exclusively"" bounce with a groove that recalls their former label's house band, Booker T. and the MGs, and the awkwardly charming ""Aria Largo"" sounds like the coolest wedding processional ever. But <em>In Space</em> ends on a dim note, with the mess that they've titled ""Makeover"". It's the inverse of ""Love Revolution""-- a self-impressed racket that's not even salvaged by its insistent bassline.</p><p>  Still, for all its bright spots, <em>In Space</em> is not much more than adequate power pop. It's hard to judge the album on its own terms and almost impossible to shake the fact that it would sound better with another band's name on the spine, one that didn't invite hopeless comparisons to <em>#1 Record</em>, <em>Radio City</em>, and <em>Third/Sisters Lovers</em>. For instance, <em>In Space</em> would be a decent Posies album, and there's enough for a passable Chilton solo joint, but as a Big Star release, it's inescapably disappointing.</p></div>"|8981.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8981-in-space/|5.3|Stephen M.

There is no faint glow seeping through clouds of cosmic dust, no trapped heart pulsing beneath spiritless pummel; just two robo-kids who happen to know a few scales. So forget tenderness, Mommy and Daddy have none. Each song on <em>Duel at Dawn</em> promises two things: a stupid-hard drumbeat and oversaturated synths. Such is the extent of its aesthetic breadth, and Mommy and Daddy make no apologies for their insularity.</p><p>
    
    Ignore the almost wholly synthetic sound matter and you get garage rock, more or less. ""A Good Deal"" is a shuffle of arena-sized proportions, all boom-bap drums and fuzzy one-line hook. It might be directly inspired by any number of <em>Jock Jams</em> staples. Same goes for ""Cops"", which psyched me with a sibilant modified schaffel intro before taking the caveman stomp route. (Best part: dissonant, half-step organ quarters-- Andrew W.K., meet your evil doppelganger.) ""Lost the Plot"" even calls in tambourine to accompany its growling bass-as-hook and standard-issue ""whoa-oh-oh""s.</p><p>
    
    Mommy and Daddy seem hellbent on making fatuous, subtlety-free music, but sometimes they can't help it-- everyone needs a little sonic primping. Witness: the beats. These aren't graceless 808 belches, but coordinated, if simplistic, rhythms comprised of carefully chosen sounds. 'Cause hey, each violent throb has its proper snare timbre and cymbal decay. So, while what I really want from a track like ""Way West Way""-- which has all the riffy makings of awesomeness-- is unchecked Keith Moon bombast, I can appreciate the button-pressing technique.</p><p>
    
    This variant of DIY electro-punk is the Miami booty bass of indie rock: music with sharp angles and dubious ambitions. But unlike booty bass, which has a forum to release its glorious, vapid, think-with-your-pelvis energy, Mommy and Daddy do not own any dancefloors. Their breed of dumb fun gets turned away at the door and rebottled as headachey tension. I'd love to say the lyrics bolster the sound, but, like the hooks, they're subservient to the scuzz and sass, more vibe than content. Really, it's sedative or bust: Spend the full two-thirds' hour in this rubber room of an album and you'll be overhyped and screaming to be let out.</p></div>"|5640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5640-duel-at-dawn/|6.0|Sam Ubl

Some people disagree
    though, and with good reason: Think of all the rock bands that would love to
    call themselves Warlocks, but they can't because of...Warlocks. Instead they
    had to settle for ""Bloc Party"" or ""Get Him Eat Him"" or worse, ""John
    Vanderslice."" During <i>Surgery</i> I became 80% convinced the only reason
    Warlocks  put out records is to keep others from taking their band name. The
    other 20% I'm dead fucking sure these un-magical ass clowns are retards
    running with scissors, shit down their legs, hoping somebody-- anybody--
    might take off his hat and put change in it for them. ""Come save us,""
    Warlocks sing on their lazy schlock-called-stoner rock opener. ""Come save
    us, from ourselves.""</p><p>
    
    Not to say there isn't an aesthetic at work here! If you've ever gone into
    Guitar Center, to the section of the store with the guitars on the wall,
    inevitably you'll see at least three pimply dudes jackknifed over strapless
    Gibsons, left foot on the amp, their step-moms arms-folded and begrudgingly
    ""fostering a relationship"" with their hubbies' chump sons. The song the kids
    are all playing goes something like ""Thursday's Radiation"", which the
    Warlocks have graciously included midway through <i>Surgery</i>. The amp's
    built-in distortion option flipped up, one finger backs and forths over one
    string while the rest are left open, for no other reason than the kids have
    no idea what to do with them. Loud, soft, fast, slow, endless eighth-note
    down-strums, then the crucial question: ""Is playing guitar <i>this</i>
    easy?"" Step-mom's fake boobs say yes.</p><p>
    
    Apparently Warlocks used to sing about drugs or whatever, how awesome they
    are, the hilarious things that happen to your butt when you eat cat tranqs,
    etc. Ho ho ho, save ""It's Just Like Surgery"" (""There's no one else, that
    makes me feel the way that you do""), I think they've finally gotten it out
    of their system. Which leaves Warlocks with what exactly? A mopey bunch of
    trite sap O.D.-type tales almost as unstomachable as the band's former
    crapothecary hymns. The worst is bubblegum-gone-stale ""The Tangent"": ""As
    they feel his pulse/ Disappear without a trace/ What are we going to do?/
    They all scream."" The second-worst is ""We Need Starpower"", second-worst only
    because I hate meta-commentaries: ""How does one feel to be so dead inside?""
    Oh fucking boy. Kids, stick to Magic cards.</p></div>"|8586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8586-surgery/|1.7|Nick Sylvester

    that it's all shtick. If so much alt-country turned out to be a
    poseur's game of authenticity chic-- with a happy surfeit of strong
    songwriting, to be sure-- then no one embraced his poseurdom more
    openly than Ryan Adams. ""I started this damn country band/ 'Cause punk
    rock was too hard to sing,"" he admitted from the get-go, while some of
    his less obviously contrived precursors were setting old Woody Guthrie
    verses to music. When Adams' 2003 <em>Rock N Roll</em> and <em>Love Is
    Hell</em> EPs wrinkled critical noses, it wasn't due just to their
    brazenly derivative artifice-- 2000 landmark <em>Heartbreaker</em>,
    after all, simply reworked Gram Parsons-- but to a paucity of songs
    that could break their gilded genre-exercise cages.</p><p>
    
    You could be forgiven for not noticing, but earlier this year Adams
    started writing good songs again. I know! Bearded and bespectacled
    (new first name ""Grizzly"" bwahaha), his fret hand rejuvenated after an
    onstage smithereening, the Artist Forever-Ever Known as ""Prolific""
    hired a great new band, handed them a fully collaborative role, and
    laid down the surprisingly solid two-platter, pro-Grateful Dead polemic
    <em>Cold Roses</em>. Well slap me prose-purple and squirt dime-store gin
    up my nose, 'cause the second leg of Adams and the Cardinals'
    three-albums-in-one-year gimmickathon, <em>Jacksonville City
    Nights</em>, is even better-- succeeding where the equally grandiose
    same-day one-two punch of <em>Rock N Roll</em>/<em>Love Is Hell Pt. 1</em>
    so bitterly disappointed just a pair of years prior.</p><p>
<em>Jacksonville City Nights</em> reveals an Adams finally undaunted by
    his own conceits. Ostensibly named for Adams' hometown of
    Jacksonville, N.C., it's the troubadour's
    countriest effort since 1996's <em>Faithless Street</em>, only
    countrier-- lovesick sepia with pedal steel, string touches, and
    cry-in-your-unironic-Pabst honky-tonk piano. After the Garcia-esque
    sierra grassiness of <em>Cold Roses</em>, Adams vocals here conjure an
    unfaltering, fatherly pastiche of great country voices, from muddy
    Merle Haggard vibrato interspersed throughout to the Hank Williams yodel of
    ""Peaceful Valley"" or one-time Whiskeytown rarity ""My Heart Is Broken"".
    Though many of even Adams' most nostalgic lyrics could plausibly claim
    a contemporary setting, these 14 tracks exist primarily in the
    landscape of deathly sad river-bottom country, as inexorably grim as
    an unabridged fairy tale.</p><p>
    
    It's in this sense that <em>Jacksonville City Nights</em> is also Adams'
    most unbelievable album-- a lethal blow to the ""based on a true
    story!"" emo verisimilitude of so many singer-songwriters not named
    Dylan. It's difficult to believe Adams, productive as he undoubtedly
    is, when he sings of ""working hard ever since I was a kid"" over the
    chugga-chugga acoustic guitar of ""Trains"", or drawls, ""Pay my respects
    to the company store"" on upbeat first single ""The Hardest Part"". Norah Jones is equally unconvincing in their duet as she
    exhales, ""I ended up with a house full of cats"", with Adams providing
    high harmonies over Carole King ivories on one of the album's least
    successful tracks (their voices never quite mesh). Whether dreaming of
    an old-fashioned heaven or addressing a lover as ""gal"", Adams does
    less than usual to dispel accusations of affectation; this time, the
    songs' merit brushes most such charges aside. Besides, what did you
    expect, ""Summer of '69""?</p><p>
    
    Adams' country-fueled freedom from the constraints of constructed
    authenticity permits him to plumb his darkest depths yet, and some of
    his most affecting. The suicidal miserablism of his 2002
    <em>Demolition</em>'s ""Dear Chicago"", itself essentially a dark sequel
    to post-Sept. 11 hit ""New York, New York"", is nothing next to the
    stark piano ballad ""Silver Bullets"", in which the narrator gets his
    gun because ""I can't make you love me/ And you can't make me stay"".
    Slow gravestone story-songs like erstwhile title track ""September"" are
    far more effectively mopey than Adams' mope-rock <em>Love Is Hell</em>.
    More disturbing, too: Adams' casual ""sha la la"" bridge amid the three
    possible deaths in ""Pa"" spreads the song's comfortable country-waltz
    stitching over the grisliness beneath, rewarding careful listens.
    
    Here Adams' narrators more often look at love from the other side, but
    they instill its memory with appropriately homespun life. ""I could
    find her in a thunderstorm/ Just by the way that the rain would fall,""
    Adams sings on the more Parsons-like ""Hard Way to Fall""; ""Met a
    dark-haired girl that the Mississippi moon/ Musta left by mistake one
    night,"" he recalls on ""The Hardest Part"" (that part turns out to be
    love, of course). Opener ""A Kiss Before I Go"" sets the stage for
    Adams' country departure, moving beyond its conventional one-shot
    one-beer refrain to envision ""a place where nobody cries"". Title
    aside, ""Withering Heights"" keeps it simple, Adams' voice falling to a
    whisper; choked plea ""Don't Fail Me Now"" (formerly known
    as ""When the Rope Gets Tight"") closes the album fit to hang. Only
    nondescript ballad ""Games"" fails to leave any impression.</p><p>
    
    If Adams ever lets his guard down on <em>Jacksonville City Nights</em>,
    it's on second track ""The End"", which many casual listeners will
    inevitably remember as ""Jacksonville"" for its double-edged refrain.
    Adams moseys through evocative images-- ""Pentecostal pines"", leaves
    that ""burn like effigies of my kin""-- before a playful, improvisatory
    second verse (guess the missing rhyme!). Yet the fiction, the song, is
    the thing. After so many outings spent imitating others, it's tempting
    to see this progression to traditional country as Adams finally
    imitating himself; more accurately, <em>Jacksonville City Nights</em> is
    a well-lit snapshot of a talented mythmaker modeling his best
    honky-tonk garb-- and this time, holy shtick, the tailoring is almost
    impeccable.</p></div>"|43.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/43-jacksonville-city-nights/|7.7|Marc Hogan

    Things you can do: Sit there and take it.</p><p>
    
    No passive response can be taken to XBXRX's racket. <em>Sixth in Sixes</em> is not background noise; it's simply noise. Don't take
    that as negative-- if teeth-gnashing catharsis through guitar is your idea of fun, then this record is fun as hell. If not, it's
    over quickly. Throughout the entire 25-minute duration of these 18 tracks, guitars thrash in thin, abrasive approximations of
    hardcore and acid-fried rock, the drums batter new rhythms every few seconds, and the singer squeals righteously about progress,
    corruption, and the decline of civilization. On the final song, ""In Memory of Our Lives"", you can even make out what he's saying.</p><p>
<i>Sixth in Sixes</i> may have sounded like a wall of hysterics at first, but a few more listens and the complexity started to seep
    in.  This is the band's second record, and they sound more mature and generally more competent at playing than on 2001's <em>Gop Ist
    Minee</em>, if no less confrontational.  Reunited with drummer Weasel Walter, XBXRX can pull off tricks like moving from an
    overstimulated boogie to a three-chord whirling dervish spitting out bent notes on ""Gold Cross"", and jerk to the Devo-through-the-wood-chipper
    rhythms on ""Fabricated Progression"". There's even two tracks longer than two minutes with discernable melodies.  (I guess you call
    that ""artistic growth."")</p><p>
    
    The chaos of ""Beat Rolls on"" is grounded by the minimal stomp of the rhythm section, and the obligatory
    change in rhythm sounds built up to and earned, as if we followed the band instead of being repeatedly slapped by them. ""In Memory
    of Our Lives"" is a superb closer, leaving the listener with the album's best hook and most direct vocals. Anchored by a constant
    fourth-note bassline, the singing loses none of its frenzy, but becomes abundantly clear: ""The liars, the killers/ The ones who sold
    our lives/ Making profits, hitting targets/ Leaving every child behind.""</p><p>
    
    XBXRX's live performances are notoriously chaotic (enough to supposedly get the group banned from Canada), and while catching one
    of their shows may make a great story to tell the next day, the album is nothing to write home about. <em>Sixth in Sixes is
    gleefully relentless, but songs like ""Beat Rolls on"" and ""In Memory of Our Lives"" are an inkling that XBXRX are capable of much
    more. They're also the only evidence the band is making records for posterity, and not just for a souvenir from the show.</em></p></div>"|8817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8817-sixth-in-sixes/|6.5|Jason Crock

I've talked about this album with a lot of people, including Pitchfork readers and music writers, and while it is loved in the indie world like few others, a small but still significant number despise it. <em>Aeroplane</em> doesn't have the near-consensus of top-shelf 90s rock artifacts like, say, <em>Loveless</em>, <em>OK Computer</em>, or <em>Slanted and Enchanted</em>. These records are varied, of course, different in many ways. But in one key respect <em>Aeroplane</em> stands apart: This album is not cool.</p><p>Shortly after the release of <em>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</em>, <em>Puncture</em> magazine had a cover story on Neutral Milk Hotel. In it Mangum told of the influence on the record of Anne Frank's <em>The Diary of a Young Girl</em>. He explained that shortly after releasing <em>On Avery Island</em> he read the book for the first time, and found himself completely overwhelmed with sadness and grief. Back in 1998 this admission made my jaw drop. What the hell? A guy in a rock band saying he was emotionally devastated by a book everyone else in America read for a middle-school assignment? I felt embarrassed for him at first, but then, the more I thought about it and the more I heard the record, I was awed. Mangum's honesty on this point, translated directly to his music, turned out to be a source of great power.</p><p><em>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</em> is a personal album but not in the way you expect. It's not biography. It's a record of images, associations, and threads; no single word describes it so well as the beautiful and overused ""kaleidoscope."" It has the cracked logic of a dream, beginning with ""King of Carrot Flowers Part 1"". The easiest song on the record to like on first listen, it quietly introduces the listener to the to the album's world, Mangum singing in a muted voice closer to where he left off with the more restrained <em>On Avery Island</em> (through most of <em>Aeroplane</em> he sounds like he's running out of time and struggling to get everything said). The first four words are so important: ""When you were young..."" Like every perceptive artist trafficking in memory, Mangum knows dark surrealism to be the language of childhood. At a certain age the leap from kitchen utensils jammed into dad's shoulder to feet encircled by holy rattlesnakes is nothing. A cock of the head; a squint, maybe.</p>
<p>Inside this dream it all begins in the body. Moments of trauma, joy, shame-- here they're all experienced first as physical sensation. A flash of awkward intimacy is recalled as ""now how I remember you/ how I would push my fingers through your mouth/ to make those muscles move."" Sometimes I hear this line and chuckle. I think of Steve Martin in <em>The Jerk</em>, licking Bernadette Peters' entire face as a sign of affection. Mangum here reflects the age when biological drives outpace the knowledge of what to do with them, a time you're seeing sex in everything (""semen stains the mountaintops"") or that sex can be awkward and unintentionally painful (""fingers in the notches of your spine"" is not what one usually hopes for in the dark). Obsessed as it is with the textures of the flesh and the physical self as an emotional antenna, listening to <em>Aeroplane</em> sometimes seems to involve more than just your ears.</p>
<p>Then there's the record's disorienting relationship to time. The instrumentation seems plucked randomly from different years in the 20th century: singing saws, Salvation Army horn arrangements, banjo, accordion, pipes. Lyrical references to technology are hard to fix. Anne Frank's lifespan from 1929 to 1945 is perhaps the record's historical center, but the perspective jumps back and forth over centuries, with images and figures sucked from their own age and squirted out somewhere else. When ""The King of Carrot Flowers Part 3"" mentions ""a synthetic flying machine"" our minds leap to something like Leonardo da Vinci's 15th Century drawings of his helicopter prototype. The image in ""Two-Headed Boy"" of a mutant child trapped in a jar of formaldehyde is pulled from Dr. Moreau's industrial age island. The radio play powered by pre-electric pulleys and weights, the nuclear holocaust in the title track. What's it all about? Mangum offers an explanation for these jarring leaps in a line about Anne Frank in ""Oh Comely,"" where he sings, ""I know they buried her body with others/ her sister and mother and 500 families/ and will she remember me 50 years later/ I wished I could save her in some sort of time machine."" If you can move through time, see, nothing ever really dies.</p>
<p>Seven years it's been, and whether Mangum has had personal trouble or somehow lost his way with music, it's not unreasonable to think that we've heard the last from Neutral Milk Hotel. I hope he does, but he may never pick up the guitar he set down after ""Two-Headed Boy Part Two."" Even so, we have this album and another very good one, and that to me is serious riches. Amazing to think how it started, how at the core of it all was guts. I keep thinking of ""It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding,"" and one of Dylan's truest lines: ""If my thought-dreams could be seen/ They'd probably put my head in a guillotine."" <em>Aeroplane</em> is what happens when you have that knowledge and still take the risk.</p></div>"|5758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5758-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea/|10.0|Mark Richardson

In parallel with such like-minded contemporaries as Birchville Cat Motel and Richard Youngs, Vibracathedral have operated at their own unique nexus of Kraut-damaged rock, turbulent pan-ethnic folk, and Terry Riley/Tony Conrad-inspired minimalism. Before now, however, all of the group's copious output-- at least 17 full-length releases in various formats-- had been recorded live directly to two-track. But for <em>Tuning to the Rooster</em>, VCO joined producer Richard Formby (Spaceman 3, Spectrum) in a full 24-track studio, an upgrade that has resulted in what is surely the group's most vibrantly detailed eruption to date.</p><p>
    
    Centered since their formation in 1998 around the veteran axis of Julian Bradley, Neil Campbell, and Michael Flower-- and here joined by longtime regulars Adam Davenport and Bridget Hayden-- the group's work has always possessed the ornate density to justify the ""Orchestra"" designation despite their relatively small roll-call. Perhaps it's appropriate, then, that the four lengthy pieces gathered here can resemble the movements of an extended drone symphony, one that is clearly best absorbed in its entirety. The album's adept symmetry and cohesion seems particularly noteworthy considering that each of these pieces has previously appeared elsewhere in the VCO discography in an alternate or abbreviated form.</p><p>
    
    Shorter versions of the two opening tracks both originally appeared on VCO's 2002 split LP with Jackie-O Motherfucker. ""Baptism&gt;Bar&gt;Blues"" commences the album with the group already in mid-sunburst, as their lacerating layers of violin, guitar feedback and roiling percussion quickly reach prolonged crescendos that sound as if they've already been building for hours. Before long, this view dissolves seamlessly into ""Wearing Clothes of Ash,"" a 17-minute edifice of drone featuring placid ripples of piano that pierce through the ongoing sandstorm din like tiny shafts of starlight. On this track the higher resolution of the album's production is particularly effective; where on previous records Vibracathedral's individual instruments might all be consumed into one singular monochromatic blur, here each jagged note is free to swirl past with microscopic, technicolor clarity.</p><p>
    
    Following next is the violin/harmonium/electronic stomp ""Stole Some Sentimental Jewelry"", which conjures Cale-era VU improvising on a sabre-rattling Eastern European folk motif, while ""Girls with Rocks in Their Hands"" encircles a ambient riff with a steadfast patience that suggests that Vibracathedral Orchestra might easily be capable of prolonging its repetitions indefinitely. And since Tuning to the Rooster cuts off with the group still arched in mid-swell, when set on continuous play this finale can be joined almost imperceptibly back to the album's beginning to create a Mobius Strip-like listening experience, one whose mesmeric loops you'll be happy to uncoil for hours.</p></div>"|8466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8466-tuning-to-the-rooster/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

They aren't on any freak-folk compilations. They aren't the daughters of Sri Lankan rebels, and I doubt they own a Detroit techno 12"" or anything that would have been played at the Paradise Garage. I suppose that makes Bellini just good ol' math rock-- the mid- to late-90s kind on Touch and Go and Quarterstick. This figures, as Giovanna Cacciola (vocals) and Agostino Tilotta (Guitar) were in Uzeda, and Alexis Fleisig (drums) was in Girls Against Boys.</p><p>
    
    Bellini's previous album, <i>Snowing Sun, worked thanks to the bionic drumming of Damon Che from Don Cabellero. But then again that was a few years ago, when the world was simpler. It was also prior to the comi-tragic departure of Che, which would provide tabloid-esque fodder for the indie rock world.</i></p><p>
    
    Today, Bellini sound like...well, Uzeda. Cacciola still takes her English lyrics and morphs them into that of a mourning siren from a Giallo film. Tilotta's guitar work still consists of sharp jabs played at high volume, sounding reminiscent of Shellac. Maybe that's because Steve Albini is still recording Cacciola and Tilotta. The oft-forgotten rhythm section of Fleisig and Matthew Taylor both fulfill their job duties and make sure the songs drive forward, without any of the screwing around that was present on <i>Snowing Sun.</i></p><p>
    
    ""The Buffalo Song"" finds Cacciola yelling over some fine post-rock noodling/riffery; Bellini switch it up on ""Not Any Man"" which has Cacciola mellowing out and cooing, ""Say I called you my love"" like a mix of Tara Jane ONeil and PJ Harvey. Bellini move from crescendo to groove in ""The Exact Distance to the Stars"" while Cacciola mixes surrealistic bedroom behavior with existentialism. </p><p>
    
    All in all, <em>Small Stones</em> is a cohesive album, but its songs just plod down a road that is already heavily trafficked. But then again if you love their style of music, then it's nice to have a band like Bellini that's gonna consistently give you albums of the same quality, even if they only arrive every three years.</p></div>"|642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/642-small-stones/|7.3|Austin Gaines

The weakest part of Marjorie Fair's Nickelback-copycat act is that singer Evan Slamka doesn't understand that even down-trodden chamber pop can still be part deux of ""How You Remind Me"". He makes the mistake of handing us a heart worth breaking (i.e., his own, sad sucker): Glossy angst this oblivious errs regrettably on the side of self-indulgence-- while it's probably more naiveté than hubris, it's still unpardonable. Observe Slamka, born and raised in New Jersey, calling L.A.'s Skid Row ""very fast-paced, with lots of drug-related issues,"" and articulating that his short-lived residency has taught him ""more about the human condition.""</p><p>
    Big names-- Jon Brion, Billy Preston, Jerry Finn, Rob Schaff-- assist him in communicating ""feelings deep inside,"" but that's no recipe for surefire success: Marjorie Fair's shiny Beach Boys-meets-Pernice Brothers act suffers primarily from well-intentioned overproduction. Deceptively lovely arrangements are, in all likelihood, responsible for the UK release's resounding hand-clappery, but overlook lush, dreamy, and too-deliberate arrangements, and there's little else that points to greatness. <em>Self Help Serenade</em> ends up like the Thrills' <em>So Much For the City</em>: Its vision, however elaborately constructed, is monotone to a fault.</p><p>
    The album's merits lie mainly with upbeat departures from humdrum tempos. ""Empty Room"" and ""Waves"" are standout tracks-- catchy gems to otherwise lugubrious melodies. ""Please Don't"" would be <em>Self Help</em>'s ""Butterfly"" (soft-spoken, repentant) if the album in question were <em>Pinkerton</em>-- only problem is, it's not: Where Weezer's loser-rock once excelled by sharing these sentiments, there's no tension on <em>Self Help</em>-- no restraint or release, just weepy nitpicking. Ballads threaten to impress but wind up sluggish and repetitive. ""My Sun Is Setting Over Her Magic"" is the band's best example of the graceful restraint but it should be more concise and its sentiment more simply expressed: ""My heart is sinking under the weight/ Of things so clear I can hardly tell/ If it's you or if it's me"" has nothing on ""Don't talk/ Put your head on my shoulder.""</p><p>
    It might be heartless to fault Slamka from good-intentioned extremes-- caring too much and trying too hard-- but please: The road to lyrical hell is paved with them, and bad poetry is still bad poetry. Heartfelt or not, <em>Self Help Serenade</em> could stand to undergo revision. Slamka is the sort of writer who doubles as mother; he loves all of his children, though he'd do better to drown three of five kittens. Next time around, Marjorie Fair should subdue cheap heartstring tugs-- quit upping production, start killing off proverbial kittens.</p></div>"|5665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5665-self-help-serenade/|6.9|Rachel Khong

Notwithstanding our
    current New York-centric hipster circle-jerk, westward expansion was a
    defining myth of the hippie-dippie Baby Boomin' rock'n'roll gypsy
    show that ultimately spawned so much of what we now call <em>Now That's
    What I Call Indie Pop, Vol. XIV</em>. Yet no California frontier has more cruelly blindsided its
    pilgrims, from Okies to Mexicans to dangerously lost cork dorks, than
    Grandaddy's Central Valley. Latest offering <em>Excerpts From the
    Diary of Todd Zilla</em> suggests it's time for Grandaddy to leave
    Modesto to the exurbanites ('sOK, I grew up near Sacramento) and
    explore some new terrain.</p><p>
    
    Recorded in eight-track at one of freshly beardless vocalist Jason
    Lytle's home studios, the new EP revisits the ruffled power-pop of
    1997's <em>Under the Western Freeway</em> more than the
    computer-shocked Lipsedelia of 2000 paranoid-<em>Kid</em>-droid
    touchstone <em>The Sophtware Slump</em> or 2003's glossy <em>Sumday</em>.
    Indeed, <em>Todd Zilla</em> is a goofy, sloppy mini-album, cramming
    familiar Weezer fuzz, stoned piano ballads, playful analogue
    synths, and misguided Bad Company references into a little more than half
    an hour. Reportedly, none of the songs will recur on Grandaddy's fifth
    full-length, expected in aught-six. That makes <em>Todd Z.</em> tempting
    like a dollar menu, so too bad only perfunctory crunch-and-""ahh""
    opener ""Pull the Curtains"" really rises above B-side caliber.</p><p>
    
    Lytle sounds bored beneath his typical raised-glazed vox, and it
    shows. Much of the record is devoted to lambasting his current locale
    with cruise-control accompaniment: Piano ballad ""Fuck the Valley
    Fudge"" sticks it to the strip malls nursery-rhyme style, ""A Valley Son
    (Sparing)"" lets plaintive acoustic guitars and Venutian sworls do the
    whining, and another piano ballad, ""Cinderland"", spreads like a ravine
    for a shrugging/shrugworthy chorus. The songs are better when they're
    more ambivalent, like ""At My Post"", which laments failed attempts to
    leave town while flipping from sludgy space waltz to shuffling
    ob-la-di blah. Whistlin' campfire closer ""Goodbye?"" focuses on this
    indecision straight-on, but you gotta hope the answer will be more
    interesting than the question.</p><p>
    
    Sure, the West is weird, but not much weirder than the rest of the
    country these days. ""There's more ATMs with air-conditioning/ Than
    there are birds on the wing,"" Lytle helpfully offers, providing a
    clunky everything-un-Zen Exhibit A for a venue change. I'm all for
    keeping it local, but even Fresno native Aaron Espinoza of Earlimart
    eventually found his way as far as Silverlake. Just please don't dally
    in ""Florida""; the EP's abortive emocore in-joke is barely OK to visit
    once, but you'd never want to live there. And yet: Go
    <em>somewhere</em>, brother, whether geographically, musically, or both.</p></div>"|3549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3549-excerpts-from-the-diary-of-todd-zilla-ep/|5.6|Marc Hogan

Amid the noise, what <em>Apologies</em> might not receive is the close listening it deserves.</p><p>  There's no question the lonesome crowded sound is here, but when Wolf Parade dig in and dust off their influences, the band rolls like a Ritalin-deprived power-Bowie or 70s Eno flexing piano-based hooks over Pixified rhythms.  Component ingredients include electronics, keyboards, guitar, drums, and two spastically surging, forever tuneful vocalists (Dan Boeckner and Spencer Krug), but there are also surprises: A theremin cries in the slow-poke ""Same Ghost Every Night""-- one of the longer tracks, it grows in pageantry as it swells to the six-minute mark-- and a spot of noise-guitar echoes throughout Krug's windy ""Dinner Bells"".  And unlike most participants in indie rock's million-band march, Wolf Parade makes familiar elements mesh in special ways.</p><p>  Groups like Neutral Milk Hotel and the Arcade Fire inspire listeners to both <em>feel</em> their music and listen closely to what's being said.  Wolf Parade's Boeckner and Krug sing so energetically it can be difficult transcribing, but as lyrics reveal themselves on multiple listens, <em>Apologies</em> is populated by ghosts, crumbled brick, haunted technology, Marcel Dzama animals, fathers and mothers, off-kilter love songs, rusted gold, and endtime/brand new world scenarios that furnish the album's ornate instrumentation and clever arrangements with an inspired if elliptical story arc.</p><p>  The album's roughly split between Boeckner and Krug, their tracks often alternating to a tee.  But there is a non-cut/dry bleed between them, with both showing up on the same song, backing each other, screaming at the same time.  I wouldn't want to inspire a quarterback controversy, but I tend to be a Krug man-- to my ear, he's the more intriguing lyricist, a Bowie-inflected guy tackling nonstandard song constructions.  On the other hand, Boeckner is more traditionally palatable, which may make him the favorite by consensus: His work is often less unhinged or unpredictable, and this focus allows for some of the album's most immediate standouts.</p><p> <em>Apologies</em> starts with Krug's mousy ""You Are a Runner and I Am My Father's Son""-- also included on the band's self-titled EP-- and Boeckner's ""Modern World"", but it really takes off with ""Grounds for Divorce"".  Honing in on one of the album's main themes, the track finds a momentary beauty and romanticism within potentially alienating technology: ""You said you hate the sound of the buses on the ground/ You said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town/ I said, 'Pretend it's whales, keeping their voices down.'"" Spiraling behind Krug's vocals, Boeckner mingles his guitar splashes with textured keys and a distant shout of affirmation.</p><p>  Boeckner's best are the anthemic ""Shine a Light"" and his lovely, ragged closer, ""This Heart's on Fire"", which induces thoughts of the Boss in full grease-monkey Valentino mode.  Krug's key tracks also come toward the album's end: the regal swagger of the Frog-Eyed ""Dear Sons and Daughters of Hungry Ghosts""-- note its absolutely sublime vocal cadences and group hug-- and ""I'll Believe in Anything"", one of my favorite tunes of the year. (Diehards can scope out an eviscerated take on Krug's Sunset Rubdown album, but in either hip-shaking form it's unexpectedly moving.) Tangy video-game synth, half-Moon drums, and pretty guitar reps embrace a maniacally charming Krug come-on: ""Give me your eyes, I need sunshine/ Your blood, your bones/ Your voice, and your ghost."" Boeckner's guitar distorts, the keys trill, Krug somehow finds even more energy in his pocket, and the fucker continues for another two-and-a-half blissful minutes with a shopping list of promises of escape and hope that culminates with: ""I'd take you where nobody knows you/ And nobody gives a damn either way.""</p><p>  On paper this all could sound average, but Wolf Parade's true talent is transforming the everyday into the unprecedented.  Fittingly, then, the record isn't going to change the direction of modern music, but it will enrich small moments of your life-- lying in bed alone or with a loved one, the morning commute, the dancefloor, a house party.</p><p>  If you can, block out the baggage of its built-in hype machine and take this stuff for what it is. I still remember the excitement felt when I first heard Modest Mouse more than a decade ago. At the time, my friend and I talked about how it sounded like this or like that or whatever, but beneath the snobbery and geeky influence-detecting, we were excited, and so obviously into what the band was doing. If given the chance, Wolf Parade should engender similar scenarios: In a few years, other folks will still remember where they were when they first heard <em>Apologies to the Queen Mary</em>.</p><p> </p></div>"|8794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8794-apologies-to-the-queen-mary/|9.2|Brandon Stosuy

Greg Cartwright has an ear for the hooks and hits from the mid-20th century, when rock, country, and r&amp;b; were only just beginning to diverge, and his songs with the Reigning Sound have the authenticity of dusty 45s by long-forgotten artists, buried for decades in some lonely LP store or flea market. It helps that the band's recordings wear their lo-fi sound like period costume-- all tape hiss, tinny high-hat, and slightly reverbed vocals. To a certain extent, both Cartwright and his listeners share the knowledge that he's speaking a dead language, one that's out-of-step at a time when rock, country, and r&amp;b; are largely compartmentalized and segregated.</p><p>
    
    These outmoded musical references only amplify the desperation and resignation in the songs. Cartwright writes and sings with the conviction of someone for whom the ""sha la la la lee"" chorus of ""Pretty Girl"" perfectly expresses his disappointments in life, love, and music. ""It won't help you to keep pretending it'll be alright tomorrow,"" he sings on the doomed-love opener, ""Find Me Now"", his voice rising in mounting despair, ""when you know it won't be alright tomorrow."" On ""What Could I Do?"" he throws up his hands when another man creates a love triangle, and he lets his regrets simmer like roasting chestnuts on ""If Christmas Can't Bring You Home"".</p><p>
    
    A few tracks on <em>Home for Orphans</em> actually <em>are</em> covers. In addition to the steamrolling live cut of the Breakers' ""Don't Send Me Flowers I Ain't Dead Yet"" that closes the album, a few of these songs originally appeared on the Reigning Sound's previous album, the aptly titled <em>Too Much Guitar!, which buried the lyrics and melodies under six feet of dirty, frustrated guitars and asked listeners to excavate them over repeated listens. </em><em>Home for Orphans</em> digs them out, dusts them off, slows them down, and puts the vocals back on top, and only a little of their original vitality is lost. ""Medication Blues"" sheds its frenzy but gains a more legible humor as Cartwright admits, ""It's not that I don't want to work/ It's just that I don't want to fill out all the applications."" And beneath the skuzzy fuzz, both ""Love Is a Funny Thing"" and ""If You Can't Give Me Everything"" reveal sadsack odes to impossible love that match the ache in Cartwright's voice, which remains one of the best in rock today.</p><p>
    
    In toning down the guitars and slowing down the tempos, the Reigning Sound have come full circle: <em>Home for Orphans</em> recalls the confident melodies and deceptively gentle sounds of their debut, <em>Break Up Break Down</em>, which was also released on Sympathy for the Record Industry. The band has stripped down its sound to the very basic elements: Cartwright's prickly guitar, the Stax-tight rhythm section of Greg Roberson and Jeremy Scott, and thrumming organ courtesy of Alex Greene, who returns as a full band member. This set-up is of course an age-old combination, but within these constraints, the Reigning Sound finds a little bit of freedom to make the old sound heartbreakingly new.</p></div>"|6923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6923-home-for-orphans/|7.8|Stephen M.

At its worst, that bass evokes the beast that every scrawny, neatly kempt one of us feels in our guts when our soon-to-be-ex refuses to answer the phone. <em>Lights Out</em>, Baldwin's debut mini-album, feels like one desparate night alone, and if it were a minute longer it would be unbearable.</p><p>
    
    A member of Newburyport, Massachusetts' Tigersaw, Baldwin regularly performs solo, and although this record uses some overdubs, it sounds live and intimate. Baldwin's croon-- a pure, clear tone with a discomforting waver-- evokes Thom Yorke's anxiety or Andrew Bird's eerier solo performances, and the album's ambience reminds me of Nina Nastasia's gothic Americana: Like Nastasia, Baldwin turns in a chamber performance that butts against the void.</p><p>
    
    On the eight songs that he penned for <em>Lights Out</em>, Baldwin takes all-too-familiar impulses and stretches them to desparate conclusions. For example, the rote ""don't leave me"" lyrics of ""Goodbye"" come out as a primal moan, while his bow jolts against the strings like a highstrung heartbeat. Throughout the album, he tries to keep his vocals on an even keel as if he's just an observer to the intensity that comes out of the bass-- like he can step back and ask if this is what it's like to become a stalker. That keeps up through almost the entire 20 minutes, until the last song, a spent ditty that basically just gives you a minute to breathe.</p><p>
    
    Although this is technically an EP, it feels complete, and exhausting. In fact, it makes me curious what Baldwin would do on a full-length record. Aside from a couple of guest singers, he performs this one alone, and it would be intriguing to see where he could go with a band-- or how he would sound across a wider emotional range. After all, he got through this album; what happens the next morning?</p></div>"|1177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1177-lights-out/|7.8|Chris Dahlen

    bred on the Isle of Man. I google-imaged ""manx"" and the fourth result was a picture of a tabby climbing drapes, which is strangely appropriate considering the Kingsbury Manx's own softness and lightness on their feet. Kittens aside, there's really no better visual descriptor for their sound than the cover of
    <i>Let You Down, their second album, which features a high-contrast painting of
    brooding clouds in a close-cropped, indeterminate corner of the sky.</i></p><p>
<i>The
    Fast Rise &amp; Fall of the South is the band's fourth full-length. After flirting with heavier rhythms and a more overt
    pop sound on 2003's <em>Aztec Discipline</em></i>, the Manx return to the more languid, understated sound of their first two LPs. Their sound is again subtle and stately, full of the humid
    tension and electric tingle of a summer thunderstorm. It has something
    of an affinity, both in tempo and melodic content, with early-70s Pink Floyd,
    especially <em>Obscured By Clouds</em> and side 1 of <em>Meddle</em>. The record is stuffed
    with two-part harmonies and country-lane textures-- banjos, acoustic guitars
    and wood block percussion mix with piano, mellotron, and organ.</p><p>
    
    The waltz has always been a formidable weapon in the hands of the Manx, but
    they outdo themselves on opener ""Harness and Wheel"", with swaying pianos,
    woozy harmonies, and cyclical guitar picking. ""And What Fallout!"" follows
    with a 5/4 groove, acoustic strings burbling on a bed of piano and drums and
    those sleepy harmonies leading the charge. Electric guitar freaks out low in
    the mix, setting the placid vibe ever-so-slightly off-balance. ""1000 8"" is
    practically intravenous pop-- it never jumps out and bites you, but the
    insistent rhythm leaves the sly melody in your head for hours, even after
    they assault the song's pastoralism with distortion that gives way to laser
    synth on the fade-out. ""Ruins"", meanwhile, is nimble backroads pop with an
    opening drum fill that hints at zydeco.</p><p>
    
    Two late songs embody the band's weather affinity better than any others:
    ""Nova"", which pours down a hailstorm of guitar of the bridge, and ""Ol'
    Mountainsides"", a track that begins with
    eerie calm and climaxes with thunderous feedback. Of course, there are
    moments on the album where the band's subtlety backfires,
    leading to a handful of tracks such as ""Greenland"" and the organ-and-voice plodder
    ""Zero G"" that feel
    like filler. The mix fails to give proper weight to the vocals from time to
    time, as well, but these are minor issues when weighed against the full heft
    of the album. <em>The Fast Rise &amp; Fall of the South</em> is quality Manx, never
    ostentatious but sure to captivate.</p></div>"|4454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4454-the-fast-rise-fall-of-the-south/|7.7|Joe Tangari

The Moistboyz are holdouts in a nation of pussies and jerk-offs."" Since the Pitchfork readership is mainly comprised of modern androgynes, young intellectuals, pussies, and jerk-offs, it's safe to say that the only reason we're covering this record is because it's Dean Ween's cock-metal side project. And hey, don't be offended by this characterization of the Pitchfork audience; take it as a compliment: Add ""Europeans"" and ""fags"" to these pejoratives and you've got a pretty exhaustive list of things that anti-intellectuals use as shorthand to describe anyone goin' around all usin' their brains and stuff.</p><p>
    So on first glance you'd have to be either incredibly stupid or terminally ironic to like this record. There is a third option, if those don't suit: There is a class of reasonably intelligent people that is attracted to all things willfully stupid and crude, a stance that seems to stem from a misconstrued notion of the value of transgression and a reaction against the intellectual posturing of academics. This is the portion of the population entirely responsible for <em>Team America</em> DVD sales, and Moistboyz <em>IV</em> is just one ""Fuck yeah!"" away from being its soundtrack. It sounds like the Hot Snakes trying to figure out whether they want to be Motörhead or the Scorpions, which isn't so bad. It's the lyrics that really grate, but if the slogans to be found on Urban Outfitters t-shirts are any indication, willful stupidity is still cool, so there's probably a market for it.</p><p>
    Whether Moistboyz's gross-out schlock is earnest or satiric makes little difference: Either way, grim doings are afoot. It starts out okay, with three silly but entertaining anti-America screeds. ""I Don't Give a Fuck Where the Eagle Flies"", is pretty funny, and it's a damn sight better than the jingoistic John Ashcroft anthem it ripostes. ""Uncle Sam and Me"" celebrates the illusory power of rock in the face of fascism, with its snarled chorus of ""Don't take my rock and roll/ Because it's all I am"" offsetting its straightforwardly anti-patriotic verses. But by the time ""Roy"", the <em>funny</em> song about pedophilia rolls around, with ""Everybody'd Fucked Her"" hot on its heels, you start to miss Warrant, who at least had the class to obscure their misogyny with pastry metaphors, and Electric 6, whose self-skewering shtick sounded more like an indictment of the ugly American than a self-satisfied, anti-intellectual glorification of it. </p></div>"|5374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5374-iv/|5.0|Brian Howe

    concerted effort to bring their old, moody post-punk sound up to date with
    what was happening at the time. That year's <em>Evergreen</em> was a pretty decent
    record, but one that took a lot of cues from the Verve, Oasis, and Britpop's other masters of the big
    ballad. The 1999 follow-up <em>What Are You Going to Do With Your Life? was Bunnymen lite, a band
    lost in the treacle of middle age, but since then they've really been striving to turn back the clock,
    if not all the way to the glory days of </em><em>Porcupine</em> and <em>Heaven Up
    Here</em>, then at least to ""Bring on the Dancing Horses"". 2001's <em>Flowers sounded
    like a tamer sequel to </em><em>Ocean Rain, and </em><em>Siberia</em>, the fourth
    studio installment from the reconvened band, sounds, well, like an even tamer
    sequel.</p><p>
    
    The band is now down to a sunglasses-in-the-dark duo of Ian McCulloch and
    Will Sergeant with hired guns to stand in for Les Pattinson and the late Pete
    de Freitas. Simon Finley and Peter Wilkinson do a dead-on impression
    of their forebears in concert, but these
    McCulloch/Sergeant compositions-- unlike the bulk of Echo's early work-- don't offer the rhythm section much to do. Wilkinson does throw down a pumping, Pattinson-style bass line on ""Parthenon
    Drive"", but that's the only real flash of rhythmic brilliance
    we're offered. It's no coincidence that it's also the most impressive song
    on the album-- the great bass part gives Sergeant his most interesting
    jumping-off point for his squirming lead guitar lines.</p><p>
    
    Much more typical is ""All Because of You Days"", a mid-tempo slice of
    brood-rock slathered in Sergeant's pyrotechnics, and McCulloch's baritone,
    which he uses in a far more hushed fashion these days than he used to when
    he was wailing away on ""Rescue"" and ""The Cutter"". If McCulloch now sounds
    conspicuously like someone's dad it's probably because
    he is, and even if when dipping back into the well
    of dark psych, the age and weariness displayed on <i>What Are You Going to
    Do... is still very much in evidence.</i></p><p>
    
    In fact, for all the noisemaking that goes on in between, the album is
    bookended by a pair of songs that look back only lyrically, preferring a
    gentler musical approach. Opener ""Stormy Weather"" is a jangling piece of pop
    that largely eschews the guitar squalls suggested by its title,
    while closer ""What If We Are"" is the big piano ballad. ""Maybe I'm not the
    boy/ Maybe I'm not the man/ But what if I am/ What if I am/ Then it's love, yes
    it's love/ Like it should be..."" it goes on like that, and it's frankly one
    of the most boring songs the band has ever done, too stuck in the middle of
    the road to have the world-moving impact it seems to aspire to.</p><p>
    
    If nothing else, <i>Siberia</i> proves McCulloch and Sergeant still have their
    songwriting craft in good working order, but it's hard to recommend an album
    on strength of craft alone-- it has to have a little verve, and unfortunately it's lacking. In the end, the band's retreat to
    the 80s falters because they can't find their way back.</p></div>"|2675.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2675-siberia/|6.7|Joe Tangari

Here's what     that impressive list of accomplishments tells you about the group's music:     just about nothing.</p>
<p>It's hard to hear Run-DMC's music as music in 2005. For 20 years, their     singles have been dorm-room staples like Hendrix and Marley; they danced     with Steven Tyler on a hundred VH-1 video countdowns, their     fedora-clad images have fossilized into pop consciousness. The group hasn't     been relevant to rap in nearly 20 years; most of the music played on     urban stations' old-school mixes comes from years after the group's peak.     More importantly, the group spent the twilight of its career making     embarrassing career move after embarrassing career move: performing at the     VMAs with Kid Rock, endorsing Virgin Cola, releasing the god-awful 2001     failed-comeback album <i>Crown Royal</i> (featuring collaborations with douchebags     like Fred Durst and the guy from Third Eye Blind), and performing at every     college in the country again and again and again even though DMC's voice was     clearly gone and Run had to help him with all his lines.</p>
<p>Now that the group's first four albums are being reissued, it makes sense to     ask whether they're worth buying, especially since multiple     hits collections have already compiled their essential singles. The simple answer is no. Every one of these studio albums     has filler, especially now that they've been loaded down with bonus tracks,     and the excellent compilation <i>Together Forever is still available at finer     used record stores nationwide. But Run-DMC remains probably the most     important group in rap history, and its albums deserve careful scrutiny, as     historical documents and sometimes as more.</i></p>
<p>The group's self-titled debut album, released in 1984, remains its most     powerful and immediate studio record, the LP that forever tore rap away     from disco and made it its own thing. Famously, the album's production     removed all the glossy live-band funk popular on the rap records of the day     and replaced it with a harsh, spacey stripped-down electronic boom. Album     opener ""Hard Times"" is a good case in point: Producer Larry Smith lays down     a spooky, chilly electro beat, nothing but a few drum-machine ticks and     claps, some heavy breathing, a couple of synth stabs. Run and DMC toss lines     back and forth in a tag-team style that never really caught on, yelling     rather than flowing, building up to the end of the verse where they're both     yelling in tandem. Lyrically, it's nothing special; their street reportage     is just another take on their first single ""It's Like That"", which is itself     a vanilla version of Melle Mel's rap on ""The Message"".</p>
<p>But musically, it's     spare and hard and densely compelling, and it probably sounded terrifying in     1984. The rest of the album sounds pretty much like this, hard empty beats     with yelled old-school catchphrase-slinging rapping, and it's a strong and     forceful time capsule from an era when rap's hardness came from its sound     rather than its lyrics or its' practitioners' biographies. The only real     misstep is ""Rock Box"", a track that buries a decent banger under layers of     unbearable hair-metal guitar wheedling. The amazing early live track ""Here     We Go (Live at the Funhouse)"", included on the reissue, proves that Run-DMC     were actually better rappers onstage than they were in the studio, but then     that track is already on <i>Together Forever</i>, as are five of the original     album's nine tracks. So <i>Run-DMC is pretty great, but you probably don't need     to own it.</i></p>
<p><i>King of Rock takes ""Rock Box"" as its starting-off point, adding a whole     lot of heavy rock guitars to the group's musical palette. The new approach     endeared the group to suburban America, but it meant that they'd never again     capture the dystopian heaviness of their debut. Fortunately, they improve on     the precedent of ""Rock Box"", finding more effective ways to throw rock into     the mix. The title track rests on a huge, stomping AC/DC riff, and the two     rappers sound pretty amazing yelling over it. ""Can You Rock It Like This"",     with its 80s synth and glossy oriental plinks, could be a Duran     Duran song until the rapping starts. This is effective stuff, but it lacks     the sonic oneness of the debut and thus carries an exponentially lesser     impact. The rapping hasn't gotten much better; they say it's ""never ever old     school"" before biting Melle Mel again on the token social-message track.     Today, their lyrics sound archaic to the point ridiculousness (""You're a     funny-looking slop eating shish kabob/ You're the reason that my eyes are     on the doorknob,"" ""Why don't you find a short pier and take a long walk?"").     ""Roots, Rap, Reggae"" is a truly shitty and forced collaboration with     Yellowman, and it captures absolutely none of what makes rap or dancehall     great. The album offers little more than the still-thrilling     rapping-over-guitars charge of the title track, but again: greatest hits.</i></p>
<p><i>Raising Hell</i> is generally considered to be the group's all-time classic,     and it certainly has its share of classic moments. Rick Rubin had by this     point taken over production from Larry Smith, and he kept the group's     thunderous stomp while adding a host of sly sampled musical touches:     unbelievably funky bells on ""Peter Piper"", a great cartoonish piano line on     ""You Be Illin'"", a dirty Southern-rock guitar riff on the title track. Run     and DMC had also stepped their rap game up; ""It's Tricky"" is basically as     good as the two of them ever got, spitting quick-tongue witticisms and     yelling booming threats with equal abandon. The album, however, has a ton of filler: the goofy     human-beatbox jam ""Hit It Run"", the ridiculously tossed-off dis ""Dumb Girl"",     the utterly blatant Slick Rick bite ""Perfection"". And ""Walk This Way"". ""Walk     This Way"" totally fucking sucks, a weak and half-baked novelty-rap jam which     got them (and Aerosmith) all over MTV but which sounds no better for having     anticipated the commercial possibilities of rap-rock.</p>
<p>That record was the group's commercial apex (it went triple platinum), but     the band took too much time off after its release, spending a couple of     years making a shitty movie and losing a court battle against its record     label. During those couple of years, the landscape of rap changed     completely; 1988 was the genre's quote-unquote Golden Age, and Run-DMC     looked like relics next to young, more skilled rappers like Rakim and Big     Daddy Kane and hungrier crews like Public Enemy and NWA. <i>Tougher Than     Leather</i> found the group playing catch-up, enlisting a new producer in Davy D     and rapping on the Marley Marl-ish breakbeats popular at the time rather     than the booming drum machines that they'd always used.</p>
<p>On tracks like ""They     Call Us Run-DMC"" and ""Radio Station"", they sound confused and out-of-touch,     kicking old-school applause lines over anemic drum breaks. They also revert     to formula a few too many times, coming with tracks that essentially amount     to sequels of previous hits: adding weird parental angst to the honking     goofball punchlines of ""You Be Illin'"" on ""Papa Crazy"", awkwardly attempting     to shoehorn breakbeats onto a ""King of Rock""-style banger on ""Soul to Rock     and Roll"", biting Slick Rick again on ""Ragtime"". But parts of <i>Tougher Than     Leather</i> are just great, especially ""Beats to the Rhyme"", which found Run and     DMC quick-tongue rapping in tandem over an amazing state-of-the-art busy     breakbeat with awesome sonar pings like Timbaland would use 10 years later.     <i>Tougher Than Leather</i> is a failure, but it's a noble one. The reissue     includes ""Christmas in Hollis"", maybe the first time they would allow     themselves to become cartoon characters, kicking it with Santa, DMC chilling     and cooling just like a snowman in a line that seems touchingly naïve in the     Jeezy era.</p>
<p>And that's it. Nobody is going to be reissuing the group's 1990 album <i>Back From Hell</i> anytime soon, and the group became an old-school signifier,     someone for rappers to quote or reference but never hire for features or     anything. The group was essentially irrelevant only five years after     releasing its first single-- to put that in perspective, Bow Wow has     been popular for a longer time. The group was hugely important in changing rap and making it an industry force, but     you can't really say they had much influence on the way it <i>sounds</i> today. They removed the flash and gloss of the disco-rap of the Sugar Hill     label, and they influenced a young LL Cool J, who influenced Boogie Down     Productions and Eric B &amp; Rakim, who influenced the Juice Crew and Public     Enemy and NWA, and on and on and on, as rap would undergo sea change after     sea change. By the late 90s, much of the music was flashier and glossier     than it ever had been in the Sugar Hill era, and any changes that Run-DMC     made were changed themselves to the point of being unrecognizable. And so     what we have now are four historical documents, each with at least a handful     of thrilling moments. And most of those thrilling moments are on <i>Together     Forever</i> or other singles compilations, so unless you're a historian or a rich person, save your money.</p></div>"|11816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11816-run-dmc-king-of-rock-raising-hell-tougher-than-leather/|8.1|Tom Breihan

<p>But musically, it's     spare and hard and densely compelling, and it probably sounded terrifying in     1984. The rest of the album sounds pretty much like this, hard empty beats     with yelled old-school catchphrase-slinging rapping, and it's a strong and     forceful time capsule from an era when rap's hardness came from its sound     rather than its lyrics or its' practitioners' biographies. The only real     misstep is ""Rock Box"", a track that buries a decent banger under layers of     unbearable hair-metal guitar wheedling. The amazing early live track ""Here     We Go (Live at the Funhouse)"", included on the reissue, proves that Run-DMC     were actually better rappers onstage than they were in the studio, but then     that track is already on <i>Together Forever</i>, as are five of the original     album's nine tracks. So <i>Run-DMC is pretty great, but you probably don't need     to own it.</i></p>
<p><i>King of Rock takes ""Rock Box"" as its starting-off point, adding a whole     lot of heavy rock guitars to the group's musical palette. The new approach     endeared the group to suburban America, but it meant that they'd never again     capture the dystopian heaviness of their debut. Fortunately, they improve on     the precedent of ""Rock Box"", finding more effective ways to throw rock into     the mix. The title track rests on a huge, stomping AC/DC riff, and the two     rappers sound pretty amazing yelling over it. ""Can You Rock It Like This"",     with its 80s synth and glossy oriental plinks, could be a Duran     Duran song until the rapping starts. This is effective stuff, but it lacks     the sonic oneness of the debut and thus carries an exponentially lesser     impact. The rapping hasn't gotten much better; they say it's ""never ever old     school"" before biting Melle Mel again on the token social-message track.     Today, their lyrics sound archaic to the point ridiculousness (""You're a     funny-looking slop eating shish kabob/ You're the reason that my eyes are     on the doorknob,"" ""Why don't you find a short pier and take a long walk?"").     ""Roots, Rap, Reggae"" is a truly shitty and forced collaboration with     Yellowman, and it captures absolutely none of what makes rap or dancehall     great. The album offers little more than the still-thrilling     rapping-over-guitars charge of the title track, but again: greatest hits.</i></p>
<p><i>Raising Hell</i> is generally considered to be the group's all-time classic,     and it certainly has its share of classic moments. Rick Rubin had by this     point taken over production from Larry Smith, and he kept the group's     thunderous stomp while adding a host of sly sampled musical touches:     unbelievably funky bells on ""Peter Piper"", a great cartoonish piano line on     ""You Be Illin'"", a dirty Southern-rock guitar riff on the title track. Run     and DMC had also stepped their rap game up; ""It's Tricky"" is basically as     good as the two of them ever got, spitting quick-tongue witticisms and     yelling booming threats with equal abandon. The album, however, has a ton of filler: the goofy     human-beatbox jam ""Hit It Run"", the ridiculously tossed-off dis ""Dumb Girl"",     the utterly blatant Slick Rick bite ""Perfection"". And ""Walk This Way"". ""Walk     This Way"" totally fucking sucks, a weak and half-baked novelty-rap jam which     got them (and Aerosmith) all over MTV but which sounds no better for having     anticipated the commercial possibilities of rap-rock.</p>
<p>That record was the group's commercial apex (it went triple platinum), but     the band took too much time off after its release, spending a couple of     years making a shitty movie and losing a court battle against its record     label. During those couple of years, the landscape of rap changed     completely; 1988 was the genre's quote-unquote Golden Age, and Run-DMC     looked like relics next to young, more skilled rappers like Rakim and Big     Daddy Kane and hungrier crews like Public Enemy and NWA. <i>Tougher Than     Leather</i> found the group playing catch-up, enlisting a new producer in Davy D     and rapping on the Marley Marl-ish breakbeats popular at the time rather     than the booming drum machines that they'd always used.</p>
<p>On tracks like ""They     Call Us Run-DMC"" and ""Radio Station"", they sound confused and out-of-touch,     kicking old-school applause lines over anemic drum breaks. They also revert     to formula a few too many times, coming with tracks that essentially amount     to sequels of previous hits: adding weird parental angst to the honking     goofball punchlines of ""You Be Illin'"" on ""Papa Crazy"", awkwardly attempting     to shoehorn breakbeats onto a ""King of Rock""-style banger on ""Soul to Rock     and Roll"", biting Slick Rick again on ""Ragtime"". But parts of <i>Tougher Than     Leather</i> are just great, especially ""Beats to the Rhyme"", which found Run and     DMC quick-tongue rapping in tandem over an amazing state-of-the-art busy     breakbeat with awesome sonar pings like Timbaland would use 10 years later.     <i>Tougher Than Leather</i> is a failure, but it's a noble one. The reissue     includes ""Christmas in Hollis"", maybe the first time they would allow     themselves to become cartoon characters, kicking it with Santa, DMC chilling     and cooling just like a snowman in a line that seems touchingly naïve in the     Jeezy era.</p>
<p>And that's it. Nobody is going to be reissuing the group's 1990 album <i>Back From Hell</i> anytime soon, and the group became an old-school signifier,     someone for rappers to quote or reference but never hire for features or     anything. The group was essentially irrelevant only five years after     releasing its first single-- to put that in perspective, Bow Wow has     been popular for a longer time. The group was hugely important in changing rap and making it an industry force, but     you can't really say they had much influence on the way it <i>sounds</i> today. They removed the flash and gloss of the disco-rap of the Sugar Hill     label, and they influenced a young LL Cool J, who influenced Boogie Down     Productions and Eric B &amp; Rakim, who influenced the Juice Crew and Public     Enemy and NWA, and on and on and on, as rap would undergo sea change after     sea change. By the late 90s, much of the music was flashier and glossier     than it ever had been in the Sugar Hill era, and any changes that Run-DMC     made were changed themselves to the point of being unrecognizable. And so     what we have now are four historical documents, each with at least a handful     of thrilling moments. And most of those thrilling moments are on <i>Together     Forever</i> or other singles compilations, so unless you're a historian or a rich person, save your money.</p></div>"|11816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11816-run-dmc-king-of-rock-raising-hell-tougher-than-leather/|5.7|Tom Breihan

Here's what     that impressive list of accomplishments tells you about the group's music:     just about nothing.</p>
<p>It's hard to hear Run-DMC's music as music in 2005. For 20 years, their     singles have been dorm-room staples like Hendrix and Marley; they danced     with Steven Tyler on a hundred VH-1 video countdowns, their     fedora-clad images have fossilized into pop consciousness. The group hasn't     been relevant to rap in nearly 20 years; most of the music played on     urban stations' old-school mixes comes from years after the group's peak.     More importantly, the group spent the twilight of its career making     embarrassing career move after embarrassing career move: performing at the     VMAs with Kid Rock, endorsing Virgin Cola, releasing the god-awful 2001     failed-comeback album <i>Crown Royal</i> (featuring collaborations with douchebags     like Fred Durst and the guy from Third Eye Blind), and performing at every     college in the country again and again and again even though DMC's voice was     clearly gone and Run had to help him with all his lines.</p>
<p>Now that the group's first four albums are being reissued, it makes sense to     ask whether they're worth buying, especially since multiple     hits collections have already compiled their essential singles. The simple answer is no. Every one of these studio albums     has filler, especially now that they've been loaded down with bonus tracks,     and the excellent compilation <i>Together Forever is still available at finer     used record stores nationwide. But Run-DMC remains probably the most     important group in rap history, and its albums deserve careful scrutiny, as     historical documents and sometimes as more.</i></p>
<p>The group's self-titled debut album, released in 1984, remains its most     powerful and immediate studio record, the LP that forever tore rap away     from disco and made it its own thing. Famously, the album's production     removed all the glossy live-band funk popular on the rap records of the day     and replaced it with a harsh, spacey stripped-down electronic boom. Album     opener ""Hard Times"" is a good case in point: Producer Larry Smith lays down     a spooky, chilly electro beat, nothing but a few drum-machine ticks and     claps, some heavy breathing, a couple of synth stabs. Run and DMC toss lines     back and forth in a tag-team style that never really caught on, yelling     rather than flowing, building up to the end of the verse where they're both     yelling in tandem. Lyrically, it's nothing special; their street reportage     is just another take on their first single ""It's Like That"", which is itself     a vanilla version of Melle Mel's rap on ""The Message"".</p>

    genres is little more than a crack. There was a time when punk, hardcore, metal, and rock were virtually miles apart. In
    the 80s, when all of those genres were going strong, the members of
    each scene treated theirs like a religion, and relating to, borrowing
    from or, frankly, enjoying any of the others were surefire ways to be subjected to ridicule and scorn. But as the years went on,
    new bands that sought to revitalize their genre found themselves
    blending styles. Punk and hardcore bands got faster and heavier until
    they were sidled right up against thrash and metal acts, who in turn
    were often turning to the classic rock of the past for renewed
    inspiration. By the late-90s, it had become commonplace to find
    longhairs at the punk shows, and mohawks had popped up on the heads
    of members of everyone from Anthrax to Warrant.</p><p>
    
    It seems unlikely, then, that a band like Lords could've existed in
    any time other than their own. Had they released <em>Swords</em> 20
    years ago, no one would've known what to do with it. Black Flag
    and Metallica fans alike would've spun the record, wondering why the
    time signature changed so much and where the guitar solos were,
    respectively. Lords' blitzkrieg approach-- this disc crams 13
    songs into less than 20 minutes-- knows no boundaries, blending the
    raucous attitude of punk with the speed and fury of thrash, all
    topped of with the testosterone-and-beer fueled swagger of good, old-fashioned rock.</p><p>
    
    The band hails from Louisville, known for its
    thriving punk and hardcore scene, and they made the jump from the
    long-standing Louisville label Initial Records to Jade Tree for
    <em>Swords</em>, their sophomore album. But anyone expecting that being
    label-mates with Pedro the Lion and the Promise Ring may have somehow
    softened Lords' approach should think again. <em>Swords</em> is brutal
    and intense, yet it avoids the darkness-and-gloom baggage that so
    many heavy bands carry around. In other words, this record is a hell
    of a lot of fun. </p><p>
    
    The gates come crashing open with ""Stigmata Rite"", 1:38 of clobbering
    drums, wailing guitars and singer Chris Owens' domineering bark. For
    the most part, the duration of the disc continues in this unrelenting
    manner, but there are exceptions that further explore the myriad of
    influences the band is pulling from. ""Watching the Clock"" combines
    verses featuring low-mixed, muted guitar over quick bursts of high-
    hat, a bridge with rapid-fire, stuttering snare fills and a chorus
    that boils down to a convoluted barrage of amplified noise.
    Furthermore, ""Lift High the Mighty Throne"" takes the band's usual
    aggressiveness and throws in a swampy, bluesy swagger. </p><p>
    
    Comparisons between Lords and other genre-blending metal bands will fall
    short: Unlike other bands, Lords aren't content with simply placing verses performed in
    one style alongside choruses from another, opting instead to throw it
    all into a menacing, razorblade-filled blender and
    stomping on the puree button. </p></div>"|4990.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4990-swords/|7.2|Cory D. Byrom

Unfortunately, his voice is too often the most interesting texture on their latest album, <em>Telescopic Eyes Glance the Future Sick</em>.</p><p>
    
    The band's experimental excursions are compelling, but their strangeness isn't incorporated across the board. The rhythm section (including the Impossible Shapes' Chris Barth on bass) is consistently creative and sharp, but there aren't any riffs here a high-school pick-up band couldn't handle-- straightforward blues-rock with a hammer-on here, a seventh chord there. Small touches like the hair-tugging single-note bends in between the verses on ""War Drums"", the atonality under the riffs in ""Cultural Hurricane"" or ""Erasing Animals"", the arctic isolation in ""Gonna Die Tonight"", or the mildly unsettling spoken word call-and-response on ""The Rattler"" rattle expectations, but there are too few of these moments. Often, they're made to stand and face the corner while the guitars strut. Lengthier tracks like the formless two-note jam ""Can't Take It"" or the dubby drum circle of ""Heliocentric Views, Pt. 2"" are the exception to the rule.</p><p>
    
    The revolutionary sentiments in Mahern's lyrics are just as banal (""Blowin' up the government was never so much fun,"" ""corporate images are burning your brain,"" ""the self-appointed king...will die""), but they capture something other revivalists often omit. Simple as they may be, they revere the idea that this music aspired to be a vehicle for change and dissent as well as a carefree good time. It's like John Wilkes Booze have dug up a time capsule and added their reflections on the present day-- uncertainty in the lyrics, chaos in the squalls of noise just behind the archaic licks-- before burying it again. It's a noble tribute, but not quite a resurrection.</p></div>"|4345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4345-telescopic-eyes-glance-the-future-sick/|6.8|Jason Crock

    uneasy alliance with cliché. In almost every case, the mandates of
    maturity occasion an acceptance of the commonplace; out are Kerouac's
    ""fabulous roman candles exploding like spiders in the stars,"" replaced
    by duty and, eventually, mortality. No longer desperate to be
    unique, this kid imagines, we become merely ourselves. The remaining
    big truths are the universals.</p><p>
    On fourth album <em>The Weight Is a Gift</em>, Nada Surf amble into
    impending senescence with hope, poise, and a similarly complex
    relationship toward the prosaic. The New York trio's 30-something
    members now bear dual millstones around their necks: Not just 1996 MTV
    Buzz Clip ""Popular"", but also the spacious, Death Cab for
    Cutie-influenced indie-pop of 2003 Barsuk debut <em>Let Go</em>. While
    <em>The Weight Is a Gift</em> lacks its predecessor's bird's-eye
    introspection and moments of near-sublimity, it's another
    often-compelling set of melancholic post-Coldplay guitar-pop, made
    grittily optimistic by the tribulations of post-hipster existence.</p><p>
    It's these burdens that have set Nada Surf free. The band will never
    be accused of defying clichés, but it has survived on an ability to
    subtly add color to them. Where ""Popular"" was itself a bratty string
    of high-school stereotypes, the more modest success of <em>Let Go</em>
    served, if not to erase the truism ""one-hit wonder,"" at least to add a
    middle option. Yeah, ""Blonde on Blonde"" absconded with a better
    songwriter's poetry, but singer Matthew Caws' forlorn falsetto and
    graceful scene-setting made the loving theft believable; ""Inside of
    Love"" was pretty much what you'd expect, done better than we had any
    right to expect.</p><p>
<em>The Weight Is a Gift</em> is a sad album that acknowledges that,
    hey, maybe the bourgeois solecisms that flow so cheaply from others'
    lips really do have meaning-- and that gives it hope. Upbeat opener
    ""Concrete Bed"" tosses out itchy acoustic guitars and clunky rhymes
    like ""ossified""/""fried"" before building into a potentially laughable
    chorus, ""To find someone you love/ You gotta be someone you love."" Yet
    Caws' subject already knows this, he says, concluding, ""You've gotta
    call your own bluff."" Third track ""Always Love"" offers a similarly
    simple sentiment and acoustic guitars that unsurprisingly build into
    chunky power-pop. Here, too, however, Caws isn't just childishly
    mouthing something he's overheard; he's coming to terms with a voice
    he's ignored.</p><p>
    The album's Northwest sheen also exists under shadow of the humdrum-- and serves as another proving ground for the underrated production of Death Cab guitarist Chris Walla, who helps give the
    straightforward tunes added scope and depth. His presence is
    particularly felt on the slowly humming, orchestral ""Your Legs Grow"",
    which appeared in different form on the <em>Future Soundtrack for
    America</em> comp. A track that could have been maudlin instead attains a
    simple beauty.</p><p>
    Suffering is essential to <em>The Weight Is a Gift</em>, but mostly as a
    turning point in the rearview mirror of redemption. The album's
    essence is encapsulated on its best song, ""Do It Again"", which starts
    with funky (well, you know, for Nada Surf) bass and spiderwebs of
    distorted guitar. ""I spend all my energy staying upright,"" Caws sighs,
    begging for another go amid the ""azalea air"" and finally coming to the
    album's title revelation as cymbals crash and background vocals swell.</p><p>
    Follow-ups have, to put it mildly, never been Nada Surf's forte. On
    <em>The Weight Is a Gift</em>, the band bears its cross and settles for a few quiet victories rather than a spectacular failure.
    Maybe I'm still young enough to hope that adulthood can be more
    surprising than this; ""All Is a Game"" never brushes aside the
    well-worn sentiment of its title or its adult-alternative environs, breakup song
    ""What Is Your Secret"" suffers from a lame movie metaphor, and dreamy ""Comes a Time"" fails to
    live up to its nods to Neil Young and <em>Paris, Texas</em>.</p><p>
    Time has allowed Nada Surf to uncover the truth in the trite, but it has
    also eroded some of the band's personality. As much as I'd like to rep
    for the preeminence of song and restraint over typical indie
    look-at-me pseudo-avant-gardism, this isn't the occasion.</p></div>"|5696.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5696-the-weight-is-a-gift/|6.4|Marc Hogan

It's a raw, unrestrained performance, and it's in stark contrast with much of <em>2012</em>. A couple of notes of ascending sliding guitar start ""Los Angeles"" with a promise of catharsis that's deliberately held back. When Arrington de Dionyso spits out phonetically funky lines like ""from the ten-oh-one to the one-ten, to the ten to the two to the one,"" then wails ""traffic is at a standstill,"" it's evocative of the record at large, like bumper-to-pumper highway traffic where every driver's had one drink one too many.</i></p><p>
    
    Holding something back reveals how strong this rhythm section is (now including Jamie Peterson of Deerhoof side project the Curtains) and proves once again the band are skilled and careful craftsman, not the faceless wailing of a second-rate Beefheart or Screamin' Jay Hawkins. <em>2012</em> lacks the accessibility of ""Cold Water"" or the rest of <em>Lost Light</em>, but it's another assertion of the band's particular talents. Opener ""Chemical Factory"" is a voyeuristic peek at a jam in progress, fading in on a stiff groove that's started before the listener hears it. The role of the guitar is de-emphasized, and the rhythm section becomes the rock around which other instruments drop in and out, like ""Chemical Factory""'s unhinged accordion performance. De Dionyso mutters mundane settings like a filthy invective, ""on the stove, on the table, in the office, in the lavatory.""</p><p>
<em>2012</em>'s concept about the impending apocalypse (which I'm told is predicted by the Mayan Long count calendar) fits: These performances are frayed, claustrophobic, and waiting for release. While other instruments are ubiquitous, like the band's growling saxophone or the mouth harp in ""Tundra"", the core of three can fill space on their own, like de Dionyso using the back of his throat for added percussion on ""Wolves and Wolverines"". ""Burial Mound"" might be the most threatening atmosphere Old Time Relijun has ever laid down, just from the relentless double bass and elemental force from the echoed slapping of the snares. The story from <em>Lost Light</em> (specifically the king) make a reappearance on that song and on ""The King of Lost Light (A Reprise)"", one of the album's most memorable tracks that builds complete chaos from the smallest elements: a one-note bassline, de Dionyso's double-panned vocal histrionics, and two simple guitar lines-- one vaguely eastern but atonal, one erratic two-note funk. ""The Blood and the Milk"" closes the record with an organ drone and a saxophone blurting so low it sounds like digeridoo until halfway though; one last shift from unpredictable noise to musical revelation.</p></div>"|5973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5973-2012/|7.7|Jason Crock

So where does that leave the first volume of Ween's <em>Shinola</em> B-sides collection? Ween's proudly sophomoric LPs shred through more genres than tracks with little in the sense of a signature sound. Thus, <em>Shinola, Vol. 1 matches up nicely with more modest full-lengths like </em><em>12 Golden Country Greats</em> or <em>Quebec</em>.</p><p>
    
    While some of <em>Shinola</em>'s tracks have circulated via the Internet and live bootlegs, none of them have appeared on a proper Ween release. Spanning from <em>Pure Guava</em>'s crude four-track sound to <i>White Pepper's full band approach, and with little liner information divulged, <em>Shinola</em>'s tracks are difficult to date, though occasionally the music spills the beans plenty. ""Tastes Good on Th'Bun"" sounds like a crusty precursor to <em>Chocolate and Cheese</em>'s ""Candi"" as the vocals get strung through a series of bizarre effects like meat through the grinder. Fuck-funk rocker ""Monique the Freak"" follows Ween's tradition of immaculate Prince spoofs, tempering the protracted horniness of the band's nine-minute classic ""L.M.L.Y.P."" into a PG-13 encomium of sexual prowess.</i></p><p>
    
    Of course, most of the album consist of tracks too goofy even for a proper Ween release. With its campy jazz sax and fake audience, ""Israel"" sounds like a deleted scene from <em>The Wedding Crashers</em>, only with stranger, spoken word vocals. ""Boys Club"" rocks like a PBS jingle, good ole' fashioned jamboree strummin' and all, not to mention the perks: ""You can talk about the future, you can talk of the past/ You can grab yourself a nice piece of ass/ Boys Club!"" ""Big Fat Fuck"" stands as the cream of this toilet humor crop, touting a blubbery industrial bassline and robotic vox reminiscent of Brainiac (or is it the other way around?).</p><p>
    
    However, all joking aside, Ween's best tracks here are those earnestly emulating the band's dearest influences. In less than four minutes, ""Gabrielle"" pulls off smart 1970s AOR better than today's cadre of retro rejects. Likewise, the cerebral ""Did You See Me?"" continues the band's long-time love affair with Pink Floyd, showcasing Ween at their most ambitious and vulnerable.</p><p>
    
    Coming from a band that teeters at the edge of novelty, Shinola offers a surprising amount of flat out brilliant songwriting moments like these, particularly for a compilation of leftovers. This isn't a ""fans-only"" job either, as the assortment of these tracks encapsulate the band's catalog as accurately as a greatest hits album. Ultimately though, Shinola's potent track list further solidifies Ween's legendary productivity, proving them infinitely more complex than your average dick and fart joke.</p></div>"|8610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8610-shinola-vol-1/|7.6|Adam Moerder

For the occasion López assembled a formidable international roster of experimental sound artists that included such disparate talents as Japanese noise mainstay Merzbow, Australian avant-garde guitarist Oren Ambarchi, and Portland, Ore.-based sound sculptor Daniel Menche. Now López has edited and mixed <em>Blank Field</em>, a compilation of live performances from the event. And despite the inherent limitations of this decontextualized format, the collection proves to be a remarkable, frequently stupefying artifact that veers madly from one sonic extremity to another.</p><p>
    Performed and recorded live at Montreal's Craig pumping station-- a structure built in 1887 to help control the floodwaters of the St. Lawrence River-- this music was created as just one aspect of a program that also showcased various electronic, architectural, and video art installations. In his own work, López has advocated an immersive listening environment, sometimes going as far as issuing blindfolds to his audience members in order to enhance their focus on the music. Here it's left unspecified whether or not these performances were originally accompanied by any other visual presentations, but nevertheless each of these outwardly diverse pieces share a certain sense of open-ended space that grants them a vaguely unfinished character, as if they're intended to be just another vibrant feature of an active urban landscape.</p><p>
    The six solo artists represented here were selected by López for what he obliquely refers to as the ""physicalization"" of their sound, placing little importance on instrumental technique or process as they each formulate their own aural universe. First up is a relatively brief electronic track by France's Manon Anne Gillis, followed by a more prolonged piece from U.S.-based composer Michael Northam. These tracks are both finely textured sequences of tiny, enigmatic occurrences, with Northam's in particular making such extensive use of prolonged silence and barely-audible drones that if you've got a moderately busy household it's only through intense concentration that you'll be able to detect whether anything is happening at all.</p><p>
    Things pick up considerably with Ambarchi's piece, an exquisite lattice of humming, gently plucked guitar tones that compares favorably to some of Loren Connor's most lyrical solo work. From there it's a rather abrupt segue into the digital anthill of Japan's Shunichiro Okada, who presents an itchy, beatless series of scrapes and buzzes with little regard for listener comfort.</p><p>
    After that, prepare yourself to be deafened by the brutal one-two sucker punch of Merzbow and Menche, especially if you've still got your speakers cranked from trying to hear the Northam track. Though predictably noisy, Merzbow's contribution is actually a reasonably tempered affair, its grainy, unsettled lurch providing one of the collection's only instances of discernable rhythm. And Menche furnishes the album a fittingly radical capper with his droning symphonic swells and amplified organic contortions. Throughout it all, López does his best to create in these pieces some semblance of continuity, allowing each track to bleed into the next with a cinematic slow dissolve. But for the most part he has wisely chosen to leave himself out of the frame, realizing that it's the bewildering multiplicity of these distinctive voices that gives <em>Blank Field</em> its strange and potent juice.</p></div>"|2098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2098-blank-field/|7.0|Matthew Murphy

When Jóhann Jóhannsson of Iceland was commissioned to write the score for the 2004 film <em>Dís</em>, which he says, ""Captures quite well the zeitgeist of early 21st century Reykjavik,"" he sat down to create music to complement the images. He collaborated with members of various Icelandic bands including guitarist Hilmar Jensson and singer Ragheidur Gröndal but never bothered to ring his friends in the orchestra. Hearing this soundtrack I can't help thinking of Ennio Morricone, another composer who-- though he has a distinct style-- is willing to let his music proceed along functional lines. On almost every level <em>Dís</em> is completely different from Jóhannsson's last two records for Touch. Eschewing strings, horns, and cloud-drift pacing, Jóhannsson opts for a mixture of unassuming and bubbly electronic pop and delicate piano-based instrumentals.</p><p>
    I said this record differs from Jóhannsson's work on <em>almost</em> every level, and the areas of overlap tell us a lot about his values as a composer. The common threads are Jóhannsson's airy use of space and the fundamental simplicity with which he approaches melody and arrangement. The repeating themes and motifs-- picking them out is always an enjoyable part of soundtrack listening-- are little tunes that would be easy to play with a couple fingers on a keyboard. Jóhannsson never uses five notes for a melody when four will do, and he's perfectly happy to let a piano with a wisp of processing do all the work when necessary. Some of this is up the job he was asked to do. Film music need only pose questions and it's up to the images to provide answers. While this can sometimes lead to soundtrack albums that seem incomplete, Jóhannsson's comfort with minimalism means <em>Dís</em> works quite well as a standalone album.</p><p>
    Though capturing the 21st century zeitgeist was a stated goal, we're living in a retro age and <em>Dís</em> has unmistakable echoes of the past. Certain glitchy techniques seem an electronic development of the last five or six years, but the bulk of the record reflects sounds and attitudes from an earlier time. Wispy instrumentals like ""Efripides Og Nedripides"" and ""Thynnkudagur"" are particularly evocative of early synthesizer music like Cluster or Kraftwerk circa <em>Ralf &amp; Florian</em>. Electronics then were still a novelty and using the machines to play a lovely well-constructed melody, maybe with a bit of piano thrown in, was comforting, a word easily applied to Jóhannsson's charming cues. The handful of upbeat pop numbers, on the other hand, have one string tied to the 80s. The guitar-led instrumental ""10 Rokkstig"" is like a slightly toned-down version of what Giorgio Moroder contributed to the <em>Top Gun</em> soundtrack, while the title track, sung by Gröndal, reminds me a bit of the Sundays. These refracted images of the past fit together to form the album's current of hazy nostalgia touched with a sense of yearning.</p><p>
    As effective as it is, <em>Dís</em> can be almost too subtle for its own good, too willing to slip into the background where it will always sound appropriate. Perhaps that's the danger of functional music, though, which doesn't take away from how enjoyable a record this can be given proper focus. It's a taut and efficient collection that, while a departure from Jóhannsson's earlier work, is in its own way just as satisfying.</p></div>"|4276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4276-dis/|7.5|Mark Richardson

It is as much of a cliché to divine     cold strategy in his every move as it is to pretend     that strategy didn't exist for, say, Janis Joplin. For     those preferring to see Bowie as a contortionist     auto-Svengali, the main revelation of the reissued     live albums <i>David Live</i> and <i>Stage</i> will be     how unafraid of imperfections he could be. These     panoramic snapshots of 1970s Bowie (<i>David Live</i> came out in 1974, with <i>Stage</i> following mere     four years later) mostly sound-- surprise-- like a     good rock band at work, not a collection of virtuoso     day laborers supplicating at the feet of the Artiste.</p>
<p>For one thing, the singing remains gloriously     unsweetened, not by studio overdubs for the original     release nor by digital trickery-- save a spit polish of the highs and fattening of     the lows-- this time. Bowie's is not exactly a golden     throat, but by the mid-70s he could will his     untrained voice into a soulful squeal, a come-hither     lounge croon, and so on; he misses some notes but never the     dramatic pitch of the line.

Interestingly enough, there are no     overlaps here (name another '70s rock act that     produced two 22-song concert sets in four years     without repeating a single number), but an     almost-complete live version of <i>Ziggy</i> can be     put together by combining the two, if desired. In the     battle of the openers, <i>Stage</i> wins-- the damp     gloom of ""Warszawa"" easily trumps the glam doom of     ""1984"".</p>

It is as much of a cliché to divine     cold strategy in his every move as it is to pretend     that strategy didn't exist for, say, Janis Joplin. For     those preferring to see Bowie as a contortionist     auto-Svengali, the main revelation of the reissued     live albums <i>David Live</i> and <i>Stage</i> will be     how unafraid of imperfections he could be. These     panoramic snapshots of 1970s Bowie (<i>David Live</i> came out in 1974, with <i>Stage</i> following mere     four years later) mostly sound-- surprise-- like a     good rock band at work, not a collection of virtuoso     day laborers supplicating at the feet of the Artiste.</p>
<p>For one thing, the singing remains gloriously     unsweetened, not by studio overdubs for the original     release nor by digital trickery-- save a spit polish of the highs and fattening of     the lows-- this time. Bowie's is not exactly a golden     throat, but by the mid-70s he could will his     untrained voice into a soulful squeal, a come-hither     lounge croon, and so on; he misses some notes but never the     dramatic pitch of the line. He also used to be one of those singers who need half a set to get     entirely comfortable on stage, and, as a result, Disc     Two of both <i>David Live</i> and <i>Stage</i> is the     stronger one by far.

The consummate community activist this is a man who dispatched his own tour bus to relieve Katrina victims in Mississippi, fueling it with faith and a MasterCard...10 months after he chauffeured voters from his neighborhood to Election Day polls last November. As he told MTV during the announcement of a Hurricane Katrina benefit concert held by his youth network, Heal the Hood (healthehood.org), ""If I lie there and mope and don't get out there and be vocal, I'm really a detriment."" Banner has the same qualities Kanye West is lionized for-- his production skills are as distinct as his diction-- with the added priceless earnings of massive hood clout. But his <em>contra</em>diction would probably be a tougher sell to <em>Time</em>, even aprés-NBC commentary; to West's affable swagger, Banner offers murky nuance, no flinching, and a not-always-friendly-sounding, hulking bark.</p><p>
    So even where <em>Certified</em> doesn't entirely congeal, Banner gets by on personality and an ever-sharpening focus-- and the man knows how to throw out a lede. Within the first few seconds of <em>Mississippi: The Album</em>, Banner'd pronounced he ""feel[s] the pain of slavery""; <em>Certified opens with ""Lost Souls"", a mournful statement of purpose spat gruffly over guitar. ""This is for my thug niggas/ All the pimps and the drug dealas/ Thieves and the motherfuckin killas/ Most of y'ain't neva had shit/ That's why we get crunk in this bitch,"" the chorus goes, after which the nascent connect-the-dots sociology comes full-throttle: ""Daddy in the pen/ Mama out suckin' dick/ I ain't never had them/ So I ride with my click/ And I'd die for my click."" Banner's anguish and aggression is central. Never menace, though; beneath Banner's gruff veneer resides a borderline absurdist with unending charisma. He calls himself the ""weird o.g."" and on </em><em>Certified</em> he reconfirms it, with heart-rending quirky lines like, ""My love was novice like the left side on my controller of my Atari"" and ""I didn't wanna be cryin'...in front of our kids/ But we don't have none"" (both from ""Thinking of You"", a sad rap about a shorty squandered, a soul mate cheated away).</p><p>
    And still, Banner is a man whose eyes, clear with the sting of misery, aim heavenward. The liner notes in <em>Certified</em> begin by quoting the Talmud, and end by mythologizing Banner's home state of Mississippi, also the namesake of his last two albums, as ""the place where pain lurked around every corner on the branches of every tall tree, and on the backs of my people...I was born out of that pain. Thank you."" Thus the sound of <em>Certified</em>, largely produced by Banner himself, is steeped in emotive acoustic guitar and fleshy electric solos, earmarking the South's musical legacy, fragments tumbling into its future of synth lines that squiggle like flickers of neon-- crunk, the thickness, the heat.</p><p>
    At times the synth, acoustic thrum, and riffage intersect, particularly on the album finale ""Crossroads"", Banner's nod to the devil, Robert Johnson, mainstream alternative radio, and ""Amazing Grace"". It's a grinding, gym-socks-metal track ready to fermoozle ClearChannel by pantomiming Linkin Park but promising liberation; Banner laments, ""I wish I could call Jesus up on the phone like, 'Lord, still burnin' from the slave trade/ Can't reproduce cause our folks got AIDS."" Meanwhile its chorus promises, ""We were blind, now we see, in the end we will be free."" The concept is impressive, and beat-wise it's a flagpole stuck out in the heavy-metal green, demarking Banner's far-flung range as both producer and fan. But, as Banner fine-tunes his mostly dead-serious themes propped by adventurous beats, the rapper's bombast doesn't always cover for his inconsistencies, and sometimes <em>Certified</em> buckles under the breadth of his production. But then, bombast goes a long way-- see the stellar ""Ain't Got Nothin'"", co-starring Magic and Lil Boosie; ""Treat Me Like a Pimp"", featuring Jadakiss, his Northern counterpart in the crushed-glass-voice contest; and the Twista collaboration ""On Everything"", a football-field burner with the ubiquitous and ever-lovable marching band back-up.</p><p>
    When Banner's on, he's on: ""I'm the new Nat Turner,"" he claims on ""Ridin'"". ""Spread something to the kids like Sojourner, man: the Truth."" <em>Blam</em>. Set atop a molasses chorus, guest rappers Dead Prez do his line justice with their trad anti-whitey, Panther-throwback Black Nationalist proclamations, though an over-syllabic, double-time verse by Talib Kweli stumbles. Which is also to say: Southern guest stars abound-- B.G., Marcus, Three 6 Mafia, 8Ball and MJG, Bun B, Gangsta Boo, his former Crooked Lettaz cohort Kamikaze-- in a chain of South-repping tracks interrupted only by ""Westside"", the weird but cute homage to Cali rappers and their legacy. Banner's bleak landscape is an eerie forewarning in a time when rappers have been more instrumental to the South's ""reconstruction,"" so Bush snakily put it, than FEMA. As Banner himself asked, ""How can a so-called 'gangsta rapper' react quicker to a crisis than our own government""? The answers are all over <em>Certified</em>, the South's first post-Katrina album. America: fuck yeah.</p></div>"|1176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1176-certified/|8.4|Julianne Shepherd

    craze, an early-century phenomenon both fueled and
    doused by the internet. In its beat-matching,
    genre-collapsing heyday, the best examples (think 2
    Many DJs or ""A Stroke of Genius"") revealed previously
    un-thought-of connections between seemingly disparate
    material, deflating indie notions of superiority by
    revealing the pop undercurrent in their favorite
    anti-mainstream warriors. But after the market became
    glutted with any combination BPMs allowed, the mashup's appeal quickly dissipated.</p><p>
    But as with most musical trends proclaimed dead by
    armchair analysts, mashups haven't really gone away,
    they've just evolved beyond the definition boundaries hastily set around them. In one way,
    they've returned to their ancestral home: DJ mixes
    that have been feeding off of unusual segues and loop
    constructions for decades. Yet simultaneously,
    there's been a progression of the form into new
    landscapes, beyond the simple combination of Beat X
    with Acapella Vocal Y, into more complex arrangements
    of previously released, recognizable,
    copyright-flaunting material.</p><p>
    A healthy avenue for this progression is the
    willfully underground breakcore scene, made up of
    artists who often seem to be competing for the title
    of Most Abrasive. The movement's forefather Kid 606
    may have steered the way with his <em>The Action-Packed
    Mentalist Brings You the Fucking Jams</em> album, and
    others have followed him into the breach, notably
    frenetic song-welders like Duran Duran Duran and more
    obscurantist chin-strokers like DJ/Rupture. Falling
    closer to the former group is Jason Forrest, née Donna
    Summer (but not <em>that</em> Donna Summer), whose '04
    long-player <em>The Unrelenting Songs of the 1979
    Post-Disco Crash</em> re-imagined classic rock staples like
    Creedence Clearwater, the Who, and Elton John amidst
    skittering drumbeats and Michael Bay speed-editing.</p><p>
<i>Unrelenting Songs was notable for its willingness to
    treat big '70s hits as open sources for
    loop-plundering, but struggled somewhat to shake the
    technique &gt; song prejudices of Forrest's genre
    loyalties. Brief moments where innovation met
    listenability-- the ultimate guitar solo of ""180 Mar
    Ton"" or the shattered and reassembled ""Who Are You""
    remix ""10 Amazing Years""-- hinted at a pop sensibility
    underneath the beat terrorism, kept frustratingly just
    out of reach. <em>Shamelessly Exciting</em> makes good on that
    promise, showcasing a Forrest just as ambitious in his
    use of samples while sanding down the sharper corners
    of his sound.</i></p><p>
    Thus, a song called ""My 36 Favorite Punk Songs"" is
    exactly that, pieces of three dozen songs thrown on
    the ground and reshuffled like a game of musical 52
    pickup. But rather than sounding like a jumbled mess,
    Forrest carefully mosaics the songs into the Ultimate
    Punk Song, scraps of the Ramones, the Clash, the Misfits, and many others bubbling up over the traditional 4/4
    chug. ""War Photographer"" montages numerous passages
    of rock-soul brass (including the godly ""Spinning
    Wheel"" by Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears) into an epic-sized
    Stax-ified ""Theme from Shaft"", while ""Dreaming and
    Remembering"" plunders the jazz section in a smooth
    strut that tries to dance-off Prefuse 73.</p><p>
    Most of the samples here are less obvious than those
    used on <em>Unrelenting Songs</em>, memory-jarrers that
    tauntingly float just out of reach. The prog-organs
    and guitar-windmills of ""Dust Never Settles"" could be
    from any Boston, Kansas, or Styx record, though
    exactly which is impossible to place; ""Skyrocket
    Saturday"" merges bluesy solos with forgotten TV show
    themes, somehow begetting disco as a result. ""Evil
    Doesn't Exist Any More"" seems to use another swampy
    lick from the Creedence catalog, but before it can be
    properly labeled, the song morphs into an expansive
    Bollywood meets drum &amp; bass crescendo that Tarantino
    has probably already earmarked for his next fight
    scene.</p><p>
    Forrest even finds time to take an atmospheric
    breather on ""Nightclothes and Headphones"", with an
    assist from Laura Cantrell that wouldn't sound out of
    place on a Dido record, save a few extra rhythm skips
    and squiggles. The song may be far and away the
    closest Jason Forrest gets to traditional song
    formatting on <em>Shamelessly Exciting</em>, but its presence
    is indicative of the concessions towards accessibility
    that permeate the entire album. By remembering the
    pop elements of the source material he uses to
    construct his tracks, and incorporating that FM-dial
    ear for melody into even his most adventurous collage
    projects, Forrest takes the mashup form beyond
    gimmickry into an entirely new, refreshingly
    listenable, excitingly shameless realm.</p></div>"|3292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3292-shamelessly-exciting/|8.2|Rob Mitchum

To see the big picture, we can look to its composition: It starts with the clean, classic stencils of the melodies, older than God's big toe, but since a good melody never goes out of style, they still charm and soothe. An all-enveloping buffer of reverb serves for shading; producer Brian McTear got busy with the tortillion and blended those crisp melodic progressions into hazy chiaroscuro. Then out comes a pastel-smeared palette, and the blank spaces fill up with autoharps and analog synths, farfisa, and lap steel, the friggin' <em>ocean</em> for chrissakes.</p><p>
    
    Yep, this is a big record, not quite over the top, but definitely peeking over the rim. The crisp, programmed drums bend Mazarin's sun-kissed guitar pop toward the Postal Service side of things, and those lustrous tintinnabulations ringing through the melodies? Trillin' like Calvin. ""The New American Apathy"" winds insistent sleigh bells around a hammering drum track, the distant bass melody boding something enormous about to clamber over the horizon, and then it does: With a dramatic introductory flourish, a bright guitar jangle arcs hugely over the tableau, the drums start to clap and jitter, and Quentin Stoltzfus unleashes a dulcet verse you know by heart from the first jubilant syllable.</p><p>
    
    For real, it's hard to find a track on this record that isn't at once impressive in its craft and deeply lovable on a sensual level; you don't even need to skip around to sing its virtues, you can just go down the track list in order. ""For Energy Infinite"" displays the kind of melodic directness you either love or hate the Strokes for, a jagged pulse careening behind Stoltzfus's ""what me, rocking?"" vocals. ""Another One Goes By"" swoons with cascading autoharp and a melancholy beach-blanket guitar lead; ""At 12 to 6"" is an icy-hot inverted world; ""Schroed(er)/inger"" suffers from stupid punctuation but makes up for it twittering electro collage within. </p><p>
    
    If there's a proverbial elephant in the room, it brought five pals, and we all know that an elephant never forgets. So while Mazarin might be too late to break bread with like-minded retro-popists from the future like Apples in Stereo and Neutral Milk Hotel, they remember their lessons, from their unaccountable fondness for paisley to their Poundian directive to take old pop and ""make it new."" The result is a spangled, soaring indie pop record as winning and ambitious as anything else we're likely to wistfully smile over this year, and the hits just keep coming. </p></div>"|5167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5167-were-already-there/|8.0|Brian Howe

On October 15 of that year a rally was held in the park as part of the nationwide Moratorium protest against the Vietnam War, and Conrad, in a moment of inspired wit, began rolling audio tape in his loft. Directing one microphone out the window towards the rally, and another towards a television broadcasting live coverage of the event, Conrad was able to create this strange, often fascinating document by combining these parallel currents of media and reality.</p><p>
    Containing a single, uninterrupted 50-minute chronicle of the day's events, Bryant Park Moratorium Rally bears more relation to Conrad's subsequent career as a video artist and media scholar (and SUNY-Buffalo professor) than to his work as a musician. Although the piece-- despite a constant barrage of car horns, police sirens and generalized crowd noise-- does reveal a certain hushed beauty in its steady, muffled tide of amassed human activity, this slice of audio verité could only be classified as music by the most indiscriminate avant-garde definition.</p><p>
    On its most immediate level, the piece functions as an entertaining, occasionally instructive, cultural time capsule. Considering the circumstances and stakes, the rally itself often proves to be a markedly congenial affair. In addition to eloquent anti-war speeches from the likes of Eugene McCarthy and the Rev. William Sloan Coffin, the program also featured the rather inconsequential presence of a stageful of Broadway actors (""Miss Helen Hayes...Eli Wallach...Ben Gazzara!"") Meanwhile, the TV coverage includes brief interviews with such notables as Dick Cavett (interviewer: ""Do you believe in this Moratorium day program?"" Cavett: ""I think it's kind of been poorly defined what it's about."") and Woody Allen (""I think it's obviously proved already that it is working, has already worked, and will work even more as the next few days go by."")</p><p>
    As illustrated by these various speeches and live interviews, one the most remarkable things about these recordings is the fact that the audio from the TV broadcast reaches Conrad's microphones sooner (and considerably more intelligibly) than the actual sounds produced outside his window. This delay not only creates a disorienting split between the album's dual channels, but also raises the rather uncomfortable notion that, at least from Conrad's vantage point, the Moratorium rally could be argued to have been more effectual as a media event than as a live one. Of course, the effects of this captured TV footage are amplified by the astonishing concentration of the newscast's live coverage, which consists of the type of continuous, uncut feed that is now essentially extinct-- outside of the odd C-SPAN broadcast-- in our current age of the 10-second sound byte.</p><p>
    Far murkier, however, is the impact of <em>Bryant Park Moratorium Rally</em> as a political instrument. Conrad originally made this recording available as a free mp3 on the eve of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it's unclear what new insights this piece truly provides for today's listeners and/or activists. At a time when 24-hour news channels routinely feature on-air anchors sitting at their computers reading e-mails and blogs aloud, the idea that the media filters and distorts our political reality surely seems a rather obvious one. And though this record does provide an engaging window through which we can witness a crucial sliver of our recent history, it's a portal that grows smaller and cloudier with each successive listen.</p></div>"|1583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1583-bryant-park-moratorium-rally-1969/|6.4|Matthew Murphy

Buzzy
    organs, neo-motorik drum parts played with brushes, breathy vocals, guitars
    that riff so subtly they almost register subconsciously, Rhodes piano,
    occasional vibraphone-- these have been their hallmarks since the start, now incredibly more than 10 years ago.</p><p>
    
    There has been gradual progress in the AmAnSet sound over the last decade as
    the songs slowly grew shorter, the rhythm section got a little
    spritelier, the compositions a little more focused. The most important thing
    about their sound, though, is that it's a genuine signature-- no one
    else really sounds like this, and their dogged consistency drives home
    how unique they are. <em>Set Free</em> is the band's sixth album, and if you're
    waiting for me to describe it, I already did in the first paragraph.
    This sounds pretty much like all the stuff that came before it, especially
    <em>Know By Heart</em>, but the strength of the material is decidedly more mixed.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Born on the Cusp"" is as fine a track as AmAnSet have
    recorded, kicking in with shy falsetto vocals, brushed snare on two
    and four, and a little Rhodes lapping at the edges. There's a
    little Motown-ish riff after the verse, and the band does a great job of
    building points of tension and crescendo in the arrangement through subtle
    manipulations of volume and density. Later, they almost rock on ""The Green
    Green Grass"", mixing in some backward guitar and very nearly distorting the
    rhythm guitar, but they follow quickly on with ""First of Four"", a speedy
    track that slides right back into their understatement comfort zone. These
    songs stand out simply for being the catchiest of the lot.</p><p>
    
    There are a few that don't fare as well-- ""She's Half"" is something of a
    departure for the band, a mostly acoustic song that overuses an echo effect while pedaling in place. The middle of
    the album is indeed problematic, ebbing too far with three slow
    tracks that get boring all sequenced in a row like they are. And closer
    ""Fuck This...I'm Leaving"" is about as graceful as its title, lacking the
    rhythmic sinew that makes their best material so captivating.</p><p>
    
    AmAnSet try some new textures, such as the melodica that lends a
    slightly sinister vibe to ""(Theme From) Everything Ends"", but there's
    nothing revelatory in the band's minor experiments, and certainly nothing
    that could be called a new direction. Newcomers should head to <em>From Our
    Living Room to Yours or </em><em>Know By Heart</em> to hear the AmAnSet at its best. As
    for fans, <em>Set Free</em> is ultimately just another American Analog Set album-- and
    probably the least essential at that.</p></div>"|159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/159-set-free/|6.8|Joe Tangari

    the Serena Maneesh dudes I plugged a week or so ago. Granted <i>Awesomer</i>
    is more <i>Dirty</i> than <i>Daydream Nation</i>, more slanted than
    enchanted. So what's the big deal? Why Blood on the Wall, besides the fact they'll only cost you five points in Brent D's Indie Fantasy League? It took me a while to realize this, but whenever I throw on one of the
    aforementioned old guy records I'm always bummed how sterile
    they sound-- not nearly as noisy and savant as I remembered them. That's not
    to say Pavement haven't aged well. Really they've aged a bit <i>too
    well. I want mold, I want putrefaction; all I get are mids and a jar of wet.</i></p><p>
<i>Awesomer</i> is a case of miscalculated personal nostalgia-- what, as of
    September 20, 2005, I thought the early 90s sounded like in the early 90s.
    I'm dead wrong, but I dig the fantasy. Dog days, not heat but humidity,
    sun-poisoned, teat-stroked naughty talks during adult swim, general
    embarrassment around the community pool because I wore shirts in the water
    and never passed the diving test-- those are my knees jerking to the labored
    tread, nic-happy trod of ""Stoner Jam"". Thirteen years ago, I'd
    have found some BBS-equivalent context to argue, wrongly, that Pixies'
    ""Where Is My Mind?"" wishes it had the nitro chorus and self-esteem of ""Mary
    Ellen""-- wishes it had something to believe in. ""I'd like to take you out
    tonight/ With your eyes clean and bright,"" sings bassist Courtney
    Shanks on ""I'd Like to Take You Out Tonight"", barely overpowering her
    brother Brad's velvet strums. If my Catholic grade school ass had known
    anything about real love, I totally would have put that song on
    Maria R.'s I-like-you mixtape instead of, jeez, ""Bullet in the Head"".</p><p>
    
    Now my young hand is bare from all this grade school '92 talk, but one more
    thing. Especially after side two's string of punchy punk numbers--
    scream-and-response bleecker ""Hey, Hey"", strung-out stooge ""Can You Hear
    Me"", nimbly plucked, possibly Smash Bros.-repping ""Get the Fuck Off My
    Cloud""-- what's clear is that BOTW don't build songs bottom-up so much as
    dream them big then sweat them down. Nothing's sparse, just concentrated,
    essential. Maybe BOTW vs. XYZ doesn't match White Stripes vs. XYZeppelin for
    quality, but the relationship's similar, and damn it all if the band doesn't
    just nail this gig in a few spots. Right, just like when you or ""your
    friend"" got up at the talent show and played Primus covers.</p></div>"|1175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1175-awesomer/|8.1|Nick Sylvester

In this sect of music retail, everything from minimal pop to ""minimal techno banger"" to ""functional minimalism"" is esteemed. I couldn't find any negative references of the word minimal, and I wondered if, in this environment, it was possible to tag anything minimal and not simultaneously be giving it a compliment. Of course, I read this at a merchant website, so not finding much in the way of objective critique isn't surprising. Nevertheless, I forged ahead.</p><p>
    Next, I googled Pitchfork's very own review archives for the word. Okay, so the first thing I found was my review of a techno single, so that doesn't count. The next one was Philip Shelburne's excellent ""The Month in Techno"" <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/10321/Column_Column_The_Month_in_Techno"">column from August</a>, wherein he asked, ""Can we please stop calling Cologne techno 'minimal'?"" His point was that in the scheme of hip, new techno, a lot of what gets called minimal isn't actually all that minimal. Next, I found Mark Richardson asking <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/21327/Req_Car_Paint_Scheme"">""how minimal is too minimal?""</a> suggesting that there really is a limit to how much (or little) minimalism we can stand. Later, he goes on to criticize the music as ""flat and one-dimensional"", and thus provides a decent benchmark for this: When you get down to one dimension, you've gone too far.</p><p>
    The problem is that the ""less is more"" concept in music is trickier than it looks. On Excepter's <em>Self Destruction</em>, I imagine some effort was made to quantize a sound that had theretofore been notable mostly because it seemed almost totally immune to imposed organization. The Brooklyn outfit, headed by John Fell Ryan, drifted spectrally through the same cosmic ether as neighbors Black Dice on occasion, playing ""noise"" that dove headfirst into modernist (and post-modernist) arenas of mechanization and detachment-- from the rest of the noise-improv underground, if from nowhere else-- even while it was psychedelic in the extreme. I would have had a hard time picking out minimalism in previous records <em>KA</em> and <em>Throne</em>, and though I was interested from the moment I heard they'd made a ""house"" record, I'm not sure I hear it here either.
    </p><p>
    But then house isn't the same thing as minimalism, though they share some ideas (like how to use repetition to best effect). Yet, <em>Self Destruction</em> confuses me: If this is a house record, where are the climaxes and releases? The gradual builds and subtle modulations? The beats?? As it happens, there are beats to be found here, but they're uniformly small, brittle, and possibly Casio-generated. Even then, I'd like to give them credit for turning workaday house drama on its head with dry, impersonal sounds, but I think that rather than make a house record, they've made a haphazardly minimal one. Rather than paint from a grid using colors from another world, they've simply reduced the number of colors they use and painted freehand geometrical objects.
    </p>
<p>
    To Excepter's credit, <em>Self Destruction</em> is billed as a house record in name only, apparently inspired more in spirit by the genre than in ""realized form"". That translates to a pretty liberal usage of, well, everything-- which has always seemed part of the Excepter M.O. ""Shoot Me First"" begins as electric sting synth and human barks at the moon, occasionally punctuated by falling stars and electro-drum pads. As moaning voices are added and the disparate tones cut into each other for screen time, the song shares much with past Excepter music. However, there are subtle differences: The sound is cleaner (probably due to this album being the band's first to feature multi-track recording and mixing), there's a lot less reverb than usual, and the general mood is less claustrophobic, more bluntly dissonant. It's as if you took a wet-dry vac to one of Excepter's spongy pieces, and sucked all the liquid out, leaving just a dry, porous mass.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Bad Vibration"" is similarly anemic, but uses a steady, pulsating drum machine tambourine to keep things moving, and a subterranean, almost submerged bass line, sounding as if blasted from an underwater cave. Ryan's lead vocal/tripping mumble is pretty out-in-front, as Excepter songs go, though is none the sturdier for it. Even surfing over the rhythmic ebb and flow, it's still a pretty queasy ""melody,"" though aided by the hazy, brooding vibe of the track, it imparts a whole range of confusion, fatalism and solemn dementia. Likewise, ""BB+B (For 2b/2c)"" uses a steady beat (midtempo and hip electro, but rudimentary) and vocals to make ghostly dance music, but here seems reigned in rather than reformed. It's not that the beats are bad, per se; rather, they're transparent, as if the lo-fi instrumentation that went into the mixing board got the better of the house concept. The vocals again seem called in from another planet, but aren't enough to keep me from falling through the holes in the architecture of the piece as a whole.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, when <em>Self Destruction</em> works, it works well. ""Interplay: Lock Room"" and ""Interplay: Your House""-- surely the most bizarre husband-wife (Caitlin Cook and Calder Martin) duets ever-- features house-esque arrangement of 808 tambourine, cowbell and handclaps, alongside Cook's alto calls, and even a recurring, harmonized synth line that almost lulls me into the idea I'm listening to actual dance music. The end of ""Your House"" falls off the piece like water retreating from the beach, back into the sea; the lone vocal evaporates and dark, metallic synth sparkles dim out into nothing. If <em>KA</em> was meditations on chaos, this is more nihilistic, and accepting of the void. But I'm cool with that. Better to minimize the arrangement than the emotional truth, regardless of where it takes you.

We Say Die!
    seem reductive. Who's to say that hedonism and destruction are the
    only alternatives-- or that they're mutually exclusive? Fusing the leftist party-punk of
    Le Tigre with the dark, militant dramatics of Pretty Girls Make
    Graves, full-length debut <em>Hit the Floor!</em> neatly strips punk
    rock and politics alike (one and the same, really) to just get with
    the beat-- or get beaten. Exclamation point, exclamation point.
    Synthesizer!</p><p>
    
    Nocturnal guitar stabs, mournful harmonies, dance-mother-fucker bass,
    and clanging hardcore beats advance the band's agenda of overthrowing,
    well, something. YSP!WSD! has a knack for emphatic
    codas that all but slip its agitprop past the brain's trusting hook
    receptors. Singer Becky Minkovic's voice exudes a horn-rimmed idealism
    that charms even as she shouts breathlessly for violence. ""We're gonna
    take 'em down in numbers one by one!"" Minkovic repeats on ""The Gap
    (Between the Rich and the Poor)"" as it surges into a bridge fit for a
    riot or a noise violation, then sighs, ""All we want is for things to
    be fair."" As a generational rallying cry, not quite ""No one here gets
    out alive,"" is it? All the better. The instruments still dip into
    martial call-and-response. The
    opening instrumental and final hidden track bookend the album with
    synth-washed apocalypse-- explosions, flames crackling, clocks
    pealing-- but first this band's painting the town red.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, the object is less Poli Sci discussion-section and more
    full-body participation. The physical realm looms large both musically
    and lyrically, from the yawpy, hand-clapping pogo-punk of ""Cold Hands!
    Hot Bodies!"" to the spinning, dipping ""Midnight Snack"" and ""Stockholm
    Syndrome Part One"" in all its skin-and-bones frenzy. The bouncy
    multi-part pop of ""You Did It!"" could pass for Architecture in
    Helsinki, goofily cheering, ""Now throw away your pack of lies!"" The
    band's politics-- personal and otherwise-- and its punk are ultimately
    about self-determination: ""I will follow me,"" Minkovic proclaims at
    the end of ""Stockholm Syndrome Part Two"". Of course, what's inside the
    body has a beat, too. ""Hold it in your chest,"" she chimes on
    you-say-die-another-day hopscotcher ""He! She! You! Me! They! Us! OK!""
    The songs are all better than their titles, I swear.</p><p>
    
    Still, beneath the oddly thrilling over-the-counter leftism and
    patchwork punk, YSP!WSD may be a sensitive band waiting to reveal
    itself. Translucent mid-tempo anthem ""Don't Wait Up"" unfolds like the Yeah
    Yeah Yeahs' heartbreaker ""Maps"", right down to waiting and
    breakup-precipice subject matter. ""Can't let my head believe what my
    heart already has received,"" Minkovic pronounces wispily, eventually
    building into another sloganeering coda: ""I'm your truth/ You be
    dare."" On ""Midnight Snack"", she pledges to ""build a moment out of
    feathers"" for a tired lover, toeing the line between vulgar
    sentimentality and soaring romanticism like a certain Pretty Girls
    Make Graves namesake (Steven, not Jack). So too the hidden track,
    which lays a timeless, vocoderrific mortal sentiment over a bed of
    synths: ""It's our last night on Earth/ Let's be together."" Turns out
    dance parties and revolutionary politics are easy; love is the big
    exclamation point exclamation point period. Question mark.</p></div>"|8918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8918-hit-the-floor/|7.3|Marc Hogan

Then again, when histrionics are your thing and you're inextricably linked to a drama queen extraodinaire such as Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart, being upstaged is inevitable. Yet despite the perpetual malaise, the Oakland five-piece has parlayed their nihilism into two impressive LPs.</p><p>
    
    Since a 2003 joint EP with the indie tear-jerkers, the Pile-Up's bleak sound is becoming too depressing to sustain itself, and <em>Picks Us Apart</em> lopsidedly focuses on melancholia over music. Although formulaic, these guys have their sterilized take on Sunny Day Real Estate down pat. Paul Gonzenbach's listless demeanor manifests itself in equally colorless guitars and austere basslines-- basically emo in its rawest form. To no one's surprise, Ben Gibbard hails the band as his personal favorite, though fortunately they haven't exchanged their challenging sound for teeny bop fawning like Death Cab's new crossover-tailored approach. Of course, none of this instrumental stuff matters once <em>Picks Us Apart</em> starts rolling and Gonzenbach stoically sings along to a suicide note on ""A Toast to the Happy Couple"".</p><p>
    
    In this opening track, Gonzenbach exudes despair, failure, and indignation in one fell swoop. Before you can say ""Sounds like Pedro the Lion!"", Gonzenbach drops the morbid line ""To my father...I leave a blood-stained mattress/ To my mother with her head to the wall/ I tried...but failed to do the simplest things that somehow mean the most."" After four more minutes of excruciating introspection, the persona concludes his letter with one final ""fuck you"" to the world: ""You are all hereby formally indicted."" Not exactly the most riveting opener, the song hangs like an albatross, and the album never really recovers. ""Silver Sparkler"" sports a nifty bassline reminiscent of early-90s lo-fi, though it repeats till exhaustion. Likewise, ""Heart My Home"" shines as the lone ballad amidst an array of homogenous slow-rockers, but sadly Gonzenbach fails to reproduce anything equally beautiful yet straightforward.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, the Pile-Up's unwavering consistency does damage control for this suicide pact of an album. Some of the more sprawling numbers evoke early Interpol EPs as droning, reverberating riffs are in no short supply. Still, Gonzenbach's funeral party doesn't seem to do justice to its own gravitas. When Jamie Stewart screams about chopping his own head off, he means business. In contrast, Gonzenbach's deadpan delivery has the emotional directness of an embittered AOL conversation and the lasting appeal of MSN Instant Messenger, making these spotlighted vocals all the more puzzling on an otherwise solid album.</p></div>"|4258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4258-picks-us-apart/|7.0|Adam Moerder

The bass and organ are great textures in themselves, but Apes consistently pull it all together for a unique and surprisingly dense sound.</p><p>
    
    With two albums and two EPs behind them, the Apes don't change their approach much on <em>Baba's Mountain</em>, but it is a more ambitious record, folding new rhythms, a few moments of calm, and more than a few moments of manipulated vocal weirdness into their smirking psychedelia. It's a little less similar to heavyweights like Black Sabbath and more like Jesus Ape Superstar, especially on the organ-driven tracks such as ""The Green Bus"" or the sunny ""Ornaments and Windchimes"". Ape Amanda is flexing her muscles more, while Weil is along for the ride, echoing the themes that Kleinman outlines and just as quickly discards.</p><p>
    
    Apes match their ambition on ""Imp Ahh"", the rhythm and melody shifting wildly while the band displays its usual swagger. Weil takes the reins on the melody and the chaos seems controlled when he's in command. <em>Baba's Mountain</em> still sounds more or less like Apes, but this is a band full of percussion instruments-- change the rhythm too often, you risk losing the listener. Songs that remain static, like the strutting bass line and smarmy vocal tics on ""What We Do Best"", leave a stronger impression.</p><p>
    
    Without the band broadening their palette, you wouldn't have songs like ""The Zookeeper's Night Out"", where feral drumming and a cautious organ melody meet with a wall of face-melting fuzz bass, and ""Imp Ahh"" or ""Can U Handle This"" would be half as stunning without their fluid structure. However,  Apes still sound best with their inimitable sound over a heavy, steady groove. Put ""What We Do Best"" against any other track here, and see which one you remember.</p></div>"|220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/220-babas-mountain/|6.9|Jason Crock

    Dust Buster with you for your first go with </em><em>Tender Buttons</em>. Where <em>The Noise Made By People</em> eagerly embraced listeners with
    its pastiche of groovy space-age bachelor pad couture and timeless pop
    songsmithery, <em>Haha Sound</em> was more standoffish at first blush. The
    tunes were there, but they were covered in a bit of soot.
    Those able to look past the static were rewarded; the clash between the
    off-putting sounds and the melodies created something greater.</p><p>
    
    The same plan of attack is in place for this album. Only two folks were
    involved in the making of <em>Tender Buttons</em>-- vocalist Trish Keenan and
    bassist James Cargill. What the group lost in manpower, they more than
    make up for in racket. Keenan, as always, lends her gorgeous frigid
    voice to the proceedings, often two times (as on the lilting ballad
    ""Tears in the Typing Pool""). As for the music, Keenan and Cargill bring
    the melodies, but then dress their poptastic efforts with whatever
    ruckus they can conjure.</p><p>
    
    It begins with the keening pings that kick off ""I Found The F"", and
    continues throughout. (For what it's worth, a kinder, gentler reprisal
    of the first track's melody ends the record.) The first single,
    ""America's Boy"", disguises its topicality in warbling, ghostly shrieks.
     ""Arc of a Journey"" chirps and skitters through its tunefulness for
    three minutes, then ends with a distorted and distended coda.
    Meanwhile, ""Corporeal"" decides to just throw in the raucous bits against
    the tune's Young Marble Giants-esque facade to see what sticks.</p><p>
    
    This possibly comes off as a dour appraisal of this album, which I
    enjoy, and there a good reason for this. As noted earlier, <em>Haha
    Sound</em> went for the approach, and brought stronger tunes to the mix (cf.
    ""Colour Me In"", ""The Little Bell""). There's no such stand-out track on
    this album (and there's certainly no ""oh wow"" moments like ""Papercuts""
    or ""Come On Let's Go"", either). What you have with <em>Tender Buttons</em> is
    a Broadcast album that listeners might need to spend more time with than
    expected. That said, this is still a Broadcast album, meaning it's one
    of the better things you'll put in your ear this year. Don't mind me if I
    reciprocate the album's tough love in equal measure.</p></div>"|948.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/948-tender-buttons/|7.5|David Raposa

    rap. He never produced a beat. He rarely wrote his own lyrics, daringly
    saying as much well before Diddy flossed his checkbook. He had a distinctive
    voice but a patchwork flow. He was the most vital architect of
    gangster shit, bane of the backpack. He stole from his own posse. He dealt
    far more misogyny to the masses than crack, but reveled in both. And he
    preached gunclapping as the apex of problem-solving. Like I said, a pretty
    vile guy. But holy shit is he eminently listenable.</p><p>
    On this reissued and expanded compilation, we get a taste of a man with no
    vulnerability, no conscience, and a truckload of everlasting iconography. A
    former dope dealer, Eazy-E, dressed all in black L.A. Kings gear and dark
    shades and carrying an automatic rifle he'd never shot in his life, brought
    more to the future of virulent hip-hop than almost any other figure. In 1987,
    he teamed with nefariously depicted white dude Jerry Heller. They soon
    formed Ruthless Records and assembled N.W.A. Two years later, the group
    unleashed <em>Straight Outta Compton</em>, razing and raising the West Coast. His
    solo career is a less-traveled, oft-forgotten road, something many of the
    South's biggest, youngest burners swear by.</p><p>
    I suppose it's difficult to ignore the rampant ho-cizing and gat-gripping that
    runs through every single song the diminutive Eazy ever recorded. At the
    root of the ""Whisper Song""'s bachanalia, I point you in the direction of
    Eazy, a man who regularly said things like ""Took her to the backroom, about
    to jack/ Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in the back."" This a guy who
    lauded sex at gun point. Cute, right?</p><p>
    If there's something truly enthusiastic to be said for Eternal E it's the
    quaking, slithery power on the 11 Dr. Dre-produced joints here. A few years
    before he morphed into that shadowy monster he is now, Dre was just the
    smiley guy in black jeans spitting Cube's writtens and slashing Parliament
    and Charles Wright samples. Dre's early N.W.A. production, the skittish
    first third of his remarkable career, was rivaled only by the Bomb Squad,
    the Dust Brothers, and DJ Premier in cohesion and pure gliding funk. It was a
    natural fit for the energetic Eazy. His notoriously squeaky chirp was best
    utilized on story songs like MC Ren's ""Nobody Move"", ""Boyz-N-Tha-Hood"", and
    ""No More ?'s""-- all included here. The latter two were written by Ice Cube and
    it shows. Cube rarely got this lewd, but the vitriol is instantly
    recognizable. Eazy, a scoundrel, wore it well.</p><p>
    Eight of the 17 tracks here, the eight best tracks, are culled from his
    seminal solo debut <em>Eazy-Duz-It. Offerings from N.W.A.'s </em><em>Efil4zaggin,
    like the crooned ""I'd Rather Fuck You"" and jovially revolting ""Automobile""
    break up the hardened glares, but replace them with dickish goofing off.
    ""Real Motherfuckin G's"" is one of the most overlooked diss records ever
    recorded wherein Eazy asks Dr. Dre of his new protégé Snoop Dogg ""Tell me
    where the fuck ya found a anorexic rapper?"" The biggest flaw here is a
    tack-on with Eazy's son, Lil Eazy, natch, falling far from the tree on ""A
    Lil Eazier Said"".</em></p><p>
    Eazy may be best remembered for revolutionizing the viability of the rap
    villain, facing off against the KKK, the FBI, his own bandmates, and White
    America. Whether Al Capone-ing his way through videos with a
    Tommy Gun (nine arrestingly shot and cinematic clips are included on a
    special DVD), staring down the po-po, or pointing out the booty shake, Eazy
    propagated a mentality that has survived, even thrived, today. Before dying
    of complications from AIDS in 1995, Ruthless Records had spawned hits from
    Above the Law, MC Ren, and most alarmingly Cleveland's Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,
    which is the true legacy of Eazy's uncanny entrepreneurial skills. His music
    still grooves, but it's tough getting behind cats who pistol-whip for head.
    Even the ones with good business sense.</p></div>"|2935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2935-eternal-e-gangsta-memorial-edition/|8.0|Sean Fennessey

Predictable band that can't reasonably be elided: The Velvet Underground. Remember when everyone was talking about how much the Strokes sounded like the Velvet Underground, and you just couldn't hear it? Couldn't reconcile (maybe barring  Julian Casablancas's dopesick drawl) the Strokes's concise packets with VU's sprawling quagmires? Chalk it up to a sort of parallax, VU appearing differently depending on where you stand: Casablancas was listening to ""White Light White Heat""; you were listening to ""Sister Ray"".</p><p>
    
    Chances are good that Stephen McBean has also spent the bulk of his VU time trolling the murky 17-minute depths of ""Sister Ray"", if we can take his songwriting choices on this Black Mountain EP at face value. The rating's a tad lower than you might expect because this already slim four-song EP only contains one unreleased track, an acoustic version of <em>Black Mountain</em>'s ""No Satisfaction"". We also get an extended version of ""Druganaut"" from the same album; ""Buffalo Swan"", the B-side of the <em>Druganaut</em> single; and ""Bicycle Man"", from a split seven-inch with Destroyer. Paucity of new material aside, the rock, as anyone familiar with Black Mountain's consistently winning LP might predict, is top-slot, unreconstructed vintage scuzz.</p><p>
    
    Black Mountain is a good reminder that people were playing stoner rock long before the modern coinage debuted: Like VU, they play rock music suited to more dangerous, debilitating drugs than a Queens of the Stone Age fan's mid-grade hydro. Nowhere is Black Mountain's affinity for opiated murk more apparent than on this extended version of ""Druganaut"". Like drugs, rock music is a shortcut to a desired physical derangement, so the comparison isn't poetic license, and if a lot of modern rock focuses on the clench-jawed climax, ""Druganaut"" is the sloe-eyed, languorous comedown. Packed with terse repetition and understatedly virtuosic flourishes, this version gives you more time to sink beneath the dark surface of the song, a surface comprised of a handful of plodding chords, cavernous vocals, some buzzing synths and a few attention-getting peaks. But it's more about waves, ambiguously lapping, than concrete forms; a downer-fed bliss-out. </p><p>
    
    ""Buffalo Swan"" is a similarly poky long-haul. Call it Black Palace: It sounds remarkably like Will Oldham's take on psych-rock might, especially the gloomy vocal, with a mid-section so squiggly and spaced out it might disintegrate without the mesmerizing rhythm track to keep it together. But by the end, the guitar finally wanders over to the bassline to cross the finish line in tandem. ""Bicycle Man"" implies that McBean's spent some time with the poppier side of VU as well, as he trades wails with Amber Webber over a peppy vamp, and ""No Satisfaction (Campfire Version)"" rollicks and rattles along like the Rolling St-- damn. I broke my promise.</p></div>"|1147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1147-druganaut-ep/|6.8|Brian Howe

    If You Were the Last Junkie on Earth"", but in rock culture,
    self-destruction never is. Nick Drake and Elliott Smith died blessedly
    dive-bar jukebox-bound, while Donovan and Smog rumble along in
    comparative obscurity. Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley never sang in
    a band called Audioslave. Sure, the case of <em>Burning Out v. Fading
    Away</em> is moot when it comes to assessing actual musical merit, but
    as precedent in the court of cred (gawd, remember <em>that</em>?) it's
    never been overturned.</p><p>
    If last year's Sundance-approved documentary <em>DiG!</em> showed us
    anything about the Dandy Warhols, it's that these four psychedelic
    power-poppers from Portland, Oregon, are immaculately versed in the
    tenets of cred-conscious self-mythologizing. Throughout the film, the
    band's foil is San Francisco psych-rock outfit the Brian Jonestown
    Massacre, whose lead singer, Anton Newcombe, is portrayed as a
    tortured artist whose fiery genius ultimately consumes him. Dandies
    frontman Courtney Taylor-Taylor, stingingly aware he lacks his hero's
    gifts, nevertheless mimics Newcombe's much-trodden rock-star antics--
    heavy drug use, sociopathic tendencies, delusions of grandeur-- all
    the while stretching one foot ever further through the door to the
    commercial success that inevitably eludes Newcombe, like Gatsby's
    green light. Even the Warhols' early song titles (""Lou Weed"", ""Ride"",
    ""Cool as Kim Deal"") come off as signifiers of cred from a band
    desperate to attain what to Newcombe comes so naturally.</p><p>
    Thus, given the chance to piggyback on <em>DiG!</em>'s success, the
    Dandies ask, ""What would a self-destructive genius do?""-- and promptly
    shoot themselves in both feet. The result, fifth album <em>Odditorium
    or Warlords of Mars</em>, looks like an attempt to rebut that
    movie's careerist image of the band, instead brandishing its sloppy
    difficulty like a severed ear. ""Don't get caught trying-- ever,""
    Taylor-Taylor admonished in a recent interview. If the statement hits
    neatly upon the defining ethos of indie-rock in the 1990s, it fails to
    consider that songwriting and creativity, not just laziness and pot
    fumes, propelled the rise of slacker icons like Beck and Pavement.
    Only the truly earless would mistake this assortment of bloated
    in-jokes and interminable, sub-song drones for some kind of
    masterpiece. The whole thing smacks of effortful effortlessness, man.</p><p>
<em>Odditorium</em> lays its first claim to cracked brilliance through
    sheer, stultifying sprawl (oh, and that off-putting title). Listeners
    must first wade through a glaringly unfunny spoken-word opener, the
    inexplicably titled ""Colder Than the Coldest Winter Was Cold"". Then,
    on ""Love is the New Feel Awful"", Taylor-Taylor floats whispery vocals
    atop a chugging spaced-out groove for its first three-plus minutes;
    for the next six, it's aimless guitar mutilation, ""A Day in the Life""
    orchestral squealing, and shrill free-jazz hornfuck. The next track,
    ""Easy"", is a more concise 7:32, but this time T2 mumbles his verses
    into morose oblivion. ""Holding Me Up"" recalls the fuzzed-out alt-pop
    of the band's first three albums, then hits repeat for another
    inessential three minute outro. The 12-minute, slow-motion krautrock
    hum of ""A Loan Tonight"" is as irredeemable as its title pun.
    ""Odditorium"" is what the Dandies call their studio; a good portion of
    its namesake should still be on the facility's floor.</p><p>
    The same studied perversity also pervades the shorter songs. ""All the
    Money or the Simple Life Honey"", uptempo with ""Soul Man"" horns and
    rattling acoustic guitar, manages to spew both typical fame-sucks
    pablum (dudes, you're only the Dandy Warhols) and positively
    prehistoric anti-sellout raillery: ""You're playing in a rock 'n' roll
    band, but still you're doing whatever the Man says."" Pretty much the
    Dandies' half of <em>DiG!</em>, come to think of it. ""Down Like Disco""
    jangles like ""Minnesoter"", from the band's 1997 <em>Come Down</em>, only
    sped-up Kanye-style, while unfortunate could-be indie-yuppie staple
    ""Everyone Is Totally Insane"" is the only time <em>Odditorium</em> echoes
    the hooky synth-pop of 2003's intermittently impressive <em>Welcome to
    the Monkeyhouse</em>. Hard-partying first single ""Smoke It"" feints
    Rolling Stones-ward until the familiar riff registers: Yup, that's the
    Hives ""Hate to Say I Told You So"". The piano-splashed one-chord mantra
    of ""There Is Only This Time"" (more horns, more Faust!) is mercifully
    capped at 4:40.</p><p>
    True to form, the Dandies maintain plausible deniability about
    <em>Odditorium</em>'s ostensible ambitions, always leaving open the Ann
    Coulter defense: If you don't like it, it was only a joke (you
    humorless sack of jihadist-spunk). First, there's the title again.
    Elsewhere, ""The New Country"" lodges a banjo firmly in its hipster-hoedown cheek.
    Dogs growl throughout sing-songy ""Did You Make a Song With Otis"", with
    lyrics about beer and ""Poopy"" tuning a guitar. And if the opener--
    ""You're listening to a piece of history,"" A&amp;E;'s Bill Kurtis pronounces
    in a rich Midwestern baritone-- doesn't exactly bring, well, any
    yucks, still Shirley it can't be serious, uh, right? A few jokes are
    overt, and uniformly excoriable: ""People got more baggage than JFK/
    And I'm talking about the airport, man!""</p><p>
    And then there are the drugs. The Dandies still take a lot of them,
    kids. At least they want you to think they do, because they never shut
    up about them. ""Great pot,"" a man's voice proclaims at the end of
    ""Everyone Is Totally Insane""; ""I wanna get high,"" goes ""Down Like
    Disco"". Yeah, ""Smoke It"", OK, we get it. In <em>DiG!</em>, the Dandies
    show up for a photo shoot at a house the Brian Jonestown Massacre
    rented in Los Angeles, a house still trashed from a party the night
    before-- a party the Dandies didn't attend. <em>Odditorium</em> is an
    album of secondhand decadence, of hand-me-down self-destruction that
    the fleeting tunes can never support. At least the Dandies can say
    they didn't try. But that's an insult to everyone who ever did.</p></div>"|2164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2164-odditorium-or-warlords-of-mars/|1.2|Marc Hogan

    So dock no points for bourgeois enmity unless you're willing to do the same to all bands that make insular music, even when you approve of one's particular insular lifestyle. Instead, save the scythe for the kitschy styling, indolent performances, and hokey gags. That, and <em>Noah's Ark is one of the most annoying records you're liable to remember. Freak-folk can be transparent, but it's also radiant with melody. Here we remove the rouge only to find dust, emaciated skeletons of songs that sound not so much played as exorcised.</em></p><p>
    
    At least the gimmicky <em>La Maison</em> meant well. The itinerant duo was lost in a meditative ether, but the album stayed anchored to a place, somewhere around the 18th Arrondissement, Paris. Never been? Didn't matter. Chez Coco was candlelit and stocked with Strega and strange pills. Half-eaten acoustic strum streamed from porous hip-hop beats, achieving contradiction: dense flavor that washed down like air. ""Good Friday"" was a whisper of haunting beauty, the sibs retching their off-tune harmony just perfectly.</p><p>
    
    Not even help from luminaries Antony and Devendra prevents Noah's Ark from coming totally unmoored. CR has abandoned its misguided love affair with delta blues, strapped on moon boots, and left Earth's orbit. The new vibe is extraterrestrial. ""The Sea Is Calm"" pits detuned player piano against disembodied voices and filthy bong bubbles. There's Banhart on the surprisingly percussive ""Brazilian Sun"", his voice garbled like almost every other sound on the record. ""Tekno Love Song,"" with its crushingly beautiful lullaby and yearning vox, comes closest to some recognizable humanity. But the gist is pretty gruesome, all hearse-drawn laments seething dyspeptic fumes, wormholed in from someplace terrifying.</p><p>
    
    The lyrics don't get us anywhere, either. On ""K-Hole"" the Casadys graduate to the hard shit. Cool, but how's the comedown? ""Tiny spirit in a k-hole/ Bloated like soggy cereal/ God will come and wash away/Our tattoos and all the cocaine/ And all of the aborted babies/Will turn into bambies."" Inversely, no friggin' clue what I was supposed to have taken to enjoy this ride, but reentry was the best part.</p></div>"|1757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1757-noahs-ark/|3.4|Sam Ubl

    probably have been ""Pistol"" Pete Maravich. Sometimes it's easy to mistake
    Axelrod's
    showy productions for bombastic and soulless affairs, much like
    Maravich's
    ill-regarded and ostentatious ball-handling. But also like Maravich,
    Axelrod
    used flash as a means to substance, not a substitute for it. His
    Capitol
    years, where he threaded the deep breakbeats of power drumming
    (typically
    courtesy the unshakeable Earl Palmer) with ornate orchestration, are
    akin to
    Pistol Pete's ridiculously unheralded four-year term at Louisiana
    State
    University. They scored at will and dazzled in the process.</p><p>
<em>The Edge is an expertly selected compendium of Axelrod at his zenith,
    including obvious orchestral monsters like Lou Rawls' ""You've Made Me
    So
    Very Happy"" strapped next to lesser-heard gems like Letta Mbulu's
    literally
    stormy ""Pula Yetia"". The majority of the 17 tracks come from
    Axelrod's solo albums, particularly his first two William
    Blake-inspired
    works, </em><em>Song of Innocence and <i>Songs of Experience</i></em>, essential if only as
    a
    tour guide through early 90s hip-hop. These albums have literally been
    a rap
    producer's delight for years. ""The Human Abstract""'s morosely
    iridescent
    piano line was famously sampled by DJ Shadow on ""Midnight in a Perfect
    World"". Pete Rock cribbed from ""Smile"" for ""Strange Fruit"". Lord
    Finesse
    dipped in, too. Black Moon got to ""A Divine Image"" as well. How ""Holy
    Thursday"", the source for UNKLE's ""Rabbit in Your Headlights"" among
    more
    than 10 other songs each more obscure than the next, missed the cut is
    inscrutable.</p><p>
    
    This wealth of sample-worthy material draws Axelrod's brilliance to light even further. Each
    element
    of his productions stood out, whether an obvious trumpet solo or the
    lowest-of-the-low key xylophone note. Axelrod was unafraid to walk near
    the
    lines of pretentiousness, too. Some songs, like ""The Signs, Part One"",
    from
    his hug-the-globe-cuz-you-love-it exploration <em>Earth Rot, used haughty
    choral
    arrangements while others used the ever-trite spoken-word. Still, he
    makes
    each one work.</em></p><p>
    
    Like the Pistol, Axelrod has been ripped off, in
    homage or not. John Stockton, another thin, white Utah Jazz guard got
    his
    game smarts and razor-sharp elbows from Maravich. Just as in the
    respectful
    and wizardly hands of Axelrod enthusiast Shadow, Axelrod's grace and
    power
    shines through. In a free-shooting whirling dervish like Allen Iverson,
    an
    obvious Maravich disciple, we see blazing talent but no brakes for the
    motor. Akin maybe to Dr. Dre, an Axelrod admirer who's been known to
    crank
    the bluster up a tad too much in the past.</p><p>
<em>The Edge closes on Cannonball Adderley's extended and tightly-laced
    ""Tensity"" a bold, buzzing 12-minute trip. The only artist to flip a
    sample from ""Tensity"" was rap duo the Beatnuts for a skit from their
    1993
    </em><em>Intoxicated Demons EP. On the skit, called ""Engineer Talking Shit"", a
    man in
    a booth, over the crashing snares of ""Tensity"", says ""They got no kind
    of
    beat, they never understand the shit, no soul."" This will never be said

It's not his best record (I am still partial to the restraint and austerity of <i>Sakura), but is perhaps the clearest rendering yet of how he hears the world.</i></p><p>
    
    Most of the sounds on <em>Symbol</em> come from sampled classical music. Choice bits from famous and not-so-famous pieces are plucked from history, placed alongside Yokota's synths and programmed drums, and looped incessantly to create a dreamy quasi-ambient fabric of sound. The sample credits stretch on like a Dust Brothers album but most of the pilfered have been dead for 100 years or more. Generally the sources lean toward the romantic. Favored throughout are the rich, swirling strings and piano from composers like Debussy, Ravel, and Tchaikovsky, and Yokota finds something pop in all of them. The wordless and ethereal female voice, a long established obsession of Yokota's, is also present. In addition to some original vocals several tracks incorporate samples of Meredith Monk, with her elastic tone veering from childlike whimsy to quasi-liturgical seriousness.</p><p>
    
    Setting works by famous composers set to beats was a pretty sizable cottage industry in the late 1970s and early 80s, but Yokota's approach is far removed from <em>Hooked on Classics</em>. Rather than using long and familiar sections of pieces, Yokota taps into the emotional material embedded in the sounds of certain instruments and severely truncated melodic fragments. Many samples remain for me, a classical novice, just below the identifiable threshold, something I've heard before in another context but can't quite place. This works to the music's advantage, as it toys with memory and the associations inherent in certain types of sound without giving itself away completely. Obvious exceptions like the loop of Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"" and swell of Mussorgsky's ""A Night on Bald Mountain"" stuck into ""Flaming Love and Destiny"" break the record's spell, but these are exceptions.</p><p>
    
    It's an aesthetic that's easy to like, with a relentless prettiness so extreme at time it takes on an almost surreal quality. Something about <em>Symbol</em> says ""ecstasy album"" to me, with a mix and arrangements seem designed to highlight the music's considerable tactile qualities above all else. There's nothing life changing about <em>Symbol</em> but it's not that kind of record; ultimately it's a lush, ornate, and elegant celebration of the oft-maligned pleasure of pure surface-level beauty.</p></div>"|8878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8878-symbol/|7.7|Mark Richardson

Along with the regrettable Audioslaves and D12s of the world, this phenomenon often stretches to high and holy indie rock and, with their revolving cast of thousands, Broken Social Scene have proven to be a busy hive of (mostly decent) indie upstarts. But with nearly every BSS permutation exhausted, the collective is wisely looking outward to avoid a half-hearted hand-me-down folly. As the first non-BSS-associated signing to their Arts &amp; Crafts label, the Most Serene Republic are an appealing, wide-eyed anti-hand-me-down sextet that may not have any concrete physical bloodlines to their crafty Canadian neighbors, but-- with their sweeping, climactic pop tendencies-- could easily sneak into a BSS family reunion and steal some BBQ'd prime ribs with few questions asked.</p><p>
    
    They also risk the chance of being thrown out due to some distant-relation quirks and contrasts. Instead of the charming, shaggy stoner vibe that permeates most of the current A&amp;C; catalog, <em>Cinematographer</em> shows off a nerdier, bookish quality. Along with an ambient, instrumental opening ""Prologue"" and closing ""Epilogue"", lead singer and trombonist Adrian Jewett has a thin, high-pitched delivery that sounds like an uber-stereotypical Trekkie singing latter-day Flaming Lips after one and a half Amstel Lights at the local suburban Toronto karaoke night. Live, Jewett's lanky frame sways awkwardly as he waves his hands around haphazardly, looking like an indie-pop sorcerer-<em>wunderkind who takes pride in emptying the spit valve of his horn. The geekiness is palpable on record as well but the frontman largely avoids overt annoyance thanks to his bandmates, who conjure a string of twisty, atmospheric indie-pop ditties that sustain a polite-- if rarely astounding-- tunefulness.</em></p><p>
    
    Awash in spacey keyboard effects and admirably varied, widescreen production, most songs go for big, emotional, full-band-chanting-something-meaningful payoffs but come up a tad short. Sometimes the problem involves too many instrumental ideas and vocal melodies packed into one track, inadvertently subverting its elusive eureka moment. ""Content Was My Favourite Color"" succumbs to this drawback as it combines speed-singing, a handclap breakdown, a vocal round, distorted breakbeats, and twinkle-time piano all within its 4:16-- consequently, the song is both impressive and frustrating. ""Where Cedar Nouns And Adverbs Walk"" has a weaker case of ADD and wisely homes in on the keyboard-bop that drives its second half, the band repeating a battle cry of ""I think we all know the words"" with increasing intensity.</p><p>
    
    With all of the members of the Most Serene Republic around 20 (they cite <em>Kid A</em> as their official musical-mind-blow moment), they have an ample amount of time, energy, and bulletproof indie connections to push their ""who you know"" to ""what you know"" ratio even further into the right direction. If the group can manage to focus their youthful exuberance without losing their abundant spontaneity, their ambitions of becoming a true musical sovereign state could very well be realized.</p></div>"|5663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5663-underwater-cinematographer/|6.8|Ryan Dombal

It must. Otherwise, Little Brother's battle cry of returning the art form to its rightful place makes less sense than it did nearly 10 years ago, when artists who weren't signed to a major label proclaimed them. So what is Little Brother saving hip-hop from? According to them, commercial artists' focus on sex, guns, and accessories are the modern-day equivalent of Vaudevillian blackface performers, seizing upon the worst characteristics of black society and hyperbolizing them to entertain a non-black audience. The proposed minstrelsy of hip-hop doesn't explain how the #1 album and single in the country come from a guy whose lyrics are more introspective than Conor Oberst's, whose biggest hit to date is about Jesus, and whose name is in everyone's mouth from suburbia to the White House because of his nationally-televised political stance.</p><p>
    
    Is Kanye in blackface? Better yet, is Missy? Or Outkast? These aren't fringe performers. They are a few of the biggest selling pop artists of the last half-decade, all of whom enjoy widespread cultural influence and power. Little Brother imply that anyone who raps about anything other than ""real life"" [read: middle-class struggles] is a disgrace, a Pied Piper to the youth, a traitor to his or her culture who needs to be shown the path to redemption. Their stance also assumes that the listening audience isn't intelligent enough to distinguish between fact and fiction, reality from rented props. If Little Brother's product were as enticing as any of the artists they decry as sellouts, their message might carry more weight, but <em>The Minstrel Show</em> adds up to little more than a loose concept constructed on tiresome production so that the group can pound its ham-fisted homilies.</p><p>
    
    The album's <em>Minstrel Show is a fictional </em><em>Saturday Night Live</em>-type program televised on the UBN (U Black Niggas-- a revealing bit of finger-pointing) network, which provides the basis for the bounty of skits and jokes throughout. Some of the skits are funny at first listen, but the skit long ago became the wanky guitar solo of hip-hop. Save the skits and one stab at soft targets, R. Kelly and Ronald Isley, Little Brother make no attempt to adhere to the concept. Lyrically, Phonte and Big Pooh offer a variety of ""we're better than you"" battle rhymes but aren't bold enough to say why. If they're on a higher plane, it seems they could come up with a few clever metaphors explaining such, but no. On ""All For You"" they tackle the difficulties of fatherhood, but it's an all-too-brief blip of social consciousness. To his credit, Phonte is an intelligent lyricist, and when he isn't married to bad ideas, he shines, as on his Foreign Exchange album with Nicolay.</p><p>
    
    And then there's 9th Wonder, whose production was supposed to change the game ever since the Roots' ?uestlove got a crush on Little Brother's early demos in 1999. The ever-graying cloud over 9th's beats is that they still sound like early demos. Despite being signed to a major and scoring scads of outside production work, 9th still sounds like he's tapping his fingers on a Best Buy synthesizer. His whispy snare hits have become so predictable you could sync your grandmother's treadmill to their rhythmic lethargy. And can we put an end to the neighborhood D'Angelo singing hooks on hip-hop records? 9th Wonder is proficient enough in selecting a soul sample and throttling the bassline that not everything is a dud (lead-single, ""Lovin' It"", ""Hiding Place"" featuring Elzhi, and ""Say It Again"").</p><p>
    
    Little Brother have good intentions. They want to sound like the groups they grew up enjoying, namely A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth (they even homage ATCQ's ""Oh My God"" on ""Still Lives Through""), but their songs sound more like signifiers of those groups, not their logical descendents. Unfortunately, the hype that floated Little Brother's careers over the last six years may have affirmed some bad habits (narrow content, homemade beats) and encouraged lofty aspirations not yet attainable. If they want to create an alternative to the types of hip-hop they don't respect, they would do well to study the lessons of their favorite records.</p></div>"|4989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4989-the-minstrel-show/|6.0|Peter Macia

    radio this summer, so it's not surprising that it towers over the album
    that shares its name. The song is a blast of righteous rage, Bob Marley's
    youngest son unleashing a towering, bulletproof torrent of abuse at the
    inequalities in his home country of Jamaica, singing about tourists ""on the
    beach with a few club sodas"" while kids kill each other a few miles away,
    all over a skeletal track of chest-slamming digital drums and synthetic
    skank. Songs like that don't come along often, so it's not a knock on
    <em>Welcome to Jamrock to say it never approaches the power of its title
    cut.</em></p><p>
    
    It would've made sense for Marley to attempt to recreate the song's
    blazing old-school one-drop roots fury throughout the album, but he opts instead to veer
    all over the musical map with about half the album barely sounding like
    reggae. The album's opener, ""Confrontation"", finds Marley in full-on prophet
    mode, singing, ""Any day, revolution might erupt/ And the skies over Kingston
    lighten up."" It seems like a fitting sequel to ""Jamrock"", except that it
    trades in that song's rootsy skank for synthetic martial drums and ominous,
    sawing soundtrack strings. Other tracks draw on the slick breakbeats and
    sampled funk-guitar stabs of late-80s new jack swing; it's not much of a
    surprise when Bobby Brown turns up halfway through the album. The expert sex
    jam ""All Night"" has a rolling throwback beat that could've come from Marley
    Marl in his prime. A handful of other songs are simply straight-up
    dancehall, weird coming from the guy who is supposedly at the forefront of
    reggae's move away from ragga; ""Hey Girl"" even sounds something like a
    laid-back take on T.O.K. (This is a good thing.)</p><p>
    
    Refreshingly, Marley sounds very little like his father. He's got a
    strained, abrasive voice with very little in common with Bob's honeyed coo,
    and his Jamaican accent is so deep and thick that it's often hard for
    American ears to tell what he's saying. On ""Beautiful"", he namechecks his
    father alongside the smooth dancehall loverman Super Cat, and in his lighter
    moments, Marley sounds strikingly like the latter. But on the sad, gorgeous
    Nas duet ""Road to Zion"", his voice is a weary, lonely sigh reminiscent of
    Horace Andy. Marley only recalls his father once on ""We're Gonna Make It"", a
    lush, burbling, melodic old-school reggae track, a style that Marley simply
    can't do anywhere near as well as his father. Much more powerful is ""Move!"",
    a song that samples his father's ""Exodus"", adding rushing drums and
    quick-tongue chatting that become increasingly passionate and
    frantic as the song progresses. When the drums drop out and Bob's voice
    comes in on the chorus, it's breathtaking.</p><p>
    
    But despite all its great moments, <em>Jamrock</em> doesn't hold together as an
    album; its constant stylistic switch-ups keep it from ever building into a
    whole. The missteps on the album are especially glaring. The Bobby Brown
    collaboration ""Beautiful"" is ruined by a cheesed-out smooth-jazz
    session-musician saxophone, while ""Pimpa's Paradise"" enlists the Roots'
    Black Thought for a boring, condescending woman-gone-astray lament. ""For the
    Babies"" is a pretty-enough ballad with an orientalist synth riff, but its
    lyrics are some pro-life bullshit that Pat Robertson would probably approve.
    And then there's the title track, a song so great that it dwarfs the rest of
    the album. Marley will be lucky if he ever equals it.</p></div>"|5664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5664-welcome-to-jamrock/|7.7|Tom Breihan

There was something puzzling about this music, though, a discord between what I read and what I heard. In print I gathered that blues was fundamentally social; I was always reading something about the big names of the genre getting their start playing fish-fries, juke joints, and rent parties. From these descriptions blues sounded like party music designed to get people dancing, but the music I was hearing was for the most part slow, brooding, and personal, often performed by a single guitar and voice. Even with, say, Muddy Waters' full band and a faster tempo, I still couldn't imagine dancing to 12-bar. What kind of parties were we talking about?</p><p>
    
    Somewhere along the line I acquired an album by Mississippi Fred McDowell called <em>Somebody Keeps Calling Me</em>, and, hearing ""Shake 'Em on Down"" and ""Drop Down Mama"" it all made sense. McDowell's guitar playing on these songs was all about rhythm, a distinctive syncopated chug that emphasized the offbeats and often stayed on a single chord. The structure seemed so much more open and inspired movement. This blues sounded like a party. Up near McDowell in the Mississippi hill country lived a man 22 years his junior named R.L. Burnside who heard his elder play and ultimately put his own spin on the stomping monochord vamp.</p><p>
    
    Burnside recorded his share of solo acoustic 12-bar, but he'll be remembered for driving electric blues. He died recently. In the last 10 years of his life he enjoyed a modest amount of fame in the indie world due largely to this record, a 1996 collaboration with the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion originally released on Matador. Burnside had already toured with the Blues Explosion by this point. When Spencer got the idea to cut a record, the band dispatched to an isolated spot in rural Mississippi with nothing but their equipment and what one imagines was a vast amount of booze. It's hard to imagine a more masculine scene: A half-dozen guys in a hunting cabin, drinking whiskey, cursing a blue streak, talking about women, and playing the kind of raunchy blues where ""I'd rather see you dead than with another man"" is as close as one gets to ""I love you.""</p><p>
    
    No question <em>A Ass Pocket of Whiskey</em> has a fair amount of contextual baggage. Just the idea, a bunch of privileged indie rockers in the presence of a senior citizen performer from a different universe. So much opportunity for condescension and general bad faith. Even the sound of Spencer's voice, the man forever burdened by his background as a semiotics student at Brown, yelping words of encouragement every few bars (""Aw, yeah! R.L.! Snake drive!""). It's going to bug some people.</p><p>
    
    Me, I think it works. More than anything Spencer's shouts remind me of Johnny Winter on Muddy Waters' comeback album <em>Hard Again</em>, the sound of an admirer in the presence of a hero, rallying him to hit the heights that originally brought the followers into his orbit. He knows he sounds like a dork. These guys, all of them, are having a ball. The band is loose but swings, the production is appropriately rough and leaking like a sieve, and the song selection draws from Burnside favorites. Listen to this take on ""Shake 'Em on Down"" and compare it to those on other Burnside records. The menace of the chords and behind-the-beat looseness of the drums can't be touched. That the Blues Explosion combed the entire Lower East Side in search of the perfect guitar/amp interface pays off. This record sounds like a blues album should.</p><p>
    
    The entire record is filled with funky rhythms, even the weird spoken story-songs like ""The Criminal Inside Me"" and ""Tojo Told Hitler"" where the Blues Explosion comps while Burnside talks shit. It all feels thrown together, with tracks that begin mid-song and sudden exclamations that send the recording deep into the red. In this context the offhand nature is a plus. <em>A Ass Pocket of Whiskey</em> is smart and funny and full of life. Fine American music we can all be proud of, now back on Fat Possum where it belongs and where the final chapter of R.L. Burnside's life began.</p></div>"|1029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1029-a-ass-pocket-of-whiskey/|7.7|Mark Richardson

From his early industrial-tinged material with then-collaborator Johnny Stevens, to explorations of trip-hop, house, jungle, dub, and beyond, Dangers has never remained in one place for too long. <em>At the Center</em>, his first full length of all-new material since 2002's <em>RUOK?</em>, continues the evolution by combining his signature break-beats and samples with jazz provided by flutist Peter Gordon, drummer Dave King, and keyboardist Craig Taborn.</p><p>
    
    From start to finish, <em>At the Center</em> covers a wide range of moods. The disc begins with ""Wild"", a slow, slinking number that builds layers of breaking beats, flute, and organ. It slides almost seamlessly into ""Flute Thang"", which lives up to its name with extensive flute soloing over piano arpeggios and short guitar bursts. ""Bohemian Grove"" has a middle-eastern flair, with prominent sitar over string swells, while, ""United Nations Etc. Etc"" evokes Daft Punk with a muffled, bouncy bass line and twisting keyboard noodling. Finally, the disc's closer, ""Granulation 1"", is a creepy combination of haunting background surges and off-kilter piano, leaving the listener quite a distance from where he or she began.</p><p>
    
    The album ambles on in an almost hypnotic fashion, sidling from track to track, switching between purely instrumental tracks and ambient soundscapes with vocal samples. Two such tracks, ""Want Ads One"" and ""Want Ads Two"", feature a comical voice-over reading want ads from a newspaper over atmospheric noise. The combination of styles creates balance, and it keeps the listener from getting too comfortable with the disc as a whole. The bulk of the album is jazz-fused, however, and the musicians play off of each other superbly, never stealing the spotlight, but never coming off as tacked on either. For this record, at least, Meat Beat Manifesto sounds as much like a band as a single musician, something Dangers has never really done before. </p><p>
    
    The real strength of <em>At the Center</em> is just how contemporary it sounds. Dangers never succumbs to the temptation to phone it in, and he never relegates himself to simply giving in and playing generic pop music. For an artist to consistently push the envelope for over 15 years is a marvel, yet Meat Beat Manifesto can easily stand shoulder to shoulder with the current round of lap-top composers, most of whom are building off of his work in the first place. </p></div>"|5196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5196-at-the-center/|7.1|Cory D.

    green bushes. Framed by the room's torn sun-brightened curtains, small
    shapes spell out codes on the glass but it's hard to distinguish
    exactly what's leaving the dim traces. Paavoharju is just as
    enigmatic. The Finnish trio's yet to accrue much stateside press, and
    the lack of outside English-language material forces the reviewer to
    face the music like a blank slate, scratching nascent opinions onto
    what will hopefully become a larger dialogue.</p><p>
    Ragnar Rock, Olli Ainala, and Lauri Ainala hail from the island town of
    Savonlinna. The ascetic born-again Christians recorded <em>Yhä hämärää</em>
    between 2001 and 2005, setting their Emersonian lyrics (all sung in
    Finnish) to a fluctuating electro-acoustic background that threads
    short-wave, field recordings, reggae beats, pinball sounds, sunken sea
    shanties, Sublime Frequencies radio scrambles, the somber choir of a
    backwoods congregation, operas made of cheap electronics, spectral
    female voices (with the occasional male bird song), chamber muses,
    midnight ambiance, and omnipresent crackles. If forced to choose a
    kindred Finnish group, Es' grave soundtracks would be closest in dusty
    elegance, but Paavoharju presents a more curious mixture-- a
    Fursaxa/Cocteau Twins B-Movie soundtrack, Sigur Rós locked in an
    underground cavern with Slowdive, or
    perhaps Syd Barrett jamming with Incredible String Band beneath a
    waterfall.</p><p>
    The permutations are various: ""Valo tihkuu kaiken läpi"" (""Light
    trickles through everything"") merges hippie guitars, dippy drum machines,
    keyboard fritz, avalanching distortion crests, and Bollywood vocals. The lyrics deal with wind,
    waves, and spiritual replenishment or manifestation: ""The branch bows/ Skims the
    surface of the water/ Breaking my reflection/ Your image it
    reveals."" Then there's ""Kuu lohduttaa huolestuneita"" (""The moon
    comforts the troubled""), the phantom interior shot of a symphonic drowning.</p><p>
    Like much of the album, ""Syvyys"" (""The deep"") feels as though it was
    recorded with water pipes running through its structures-- leaky,
    rusted veins. The track accrues the flavor of Edenic Noh Drama backed with
    a loose cable and distorted pong. ""Puhuri"" (""The Gust"") is a pile of
    pianos for Diamanda Galas to scat across with an electronic dragonfly.
    Its lyrics are beautifully puzzling: ""The
    crows shattered the sky with their song/ Children tearing tree lichen-- forgetting what was told/ After the gale that screamed while dying-- silence/ That conjures a fire on its arrival.""</p><p>
    Nothing clots long enough on <em>Yhä hämärää</em> to be considered a tendency.
    When something seems familiar or you come to expect a certain type of
    programing, Paavoharju pitch a mossy curve ball. A poppy (or
    poppy-seed) strummer, ""Aamuauringon tuntuinen"" (""Felt like the morning
    sun"") has myriad guitars, faint percussion, and elegiac vocals working
    into translucent psychedelia. ""Kuljin kauas"" (""I travelled far"") is a
    mournful vision quest sung by one of the males; the guitar and crunky
    low-bit percussion are joined by a Snoop Dogg pitch-shifter
    (seriously) as the drum gets louder for the chorus. Here and
    there, a female voice trills behind the male. More upbeat is ""Musta
    katu"" (""Black street""), which uses reggae drums, music box fuzz, and
    more male vocals along with something that sounds like harpsichord with a creakier underside.
    The song's protagonist has walked along a black street to an inn where
    he gathers all the words and ""even picks up the ones fallen on the
    ground."" An inspired closer, the song's a jubilant charm.</p><p>
    The band has stated that <em>Yhä hämärää</em> is an attempt to ""reflect inner
    landscapes"" and offers a list of ""highly inspiring places"" including
    ""graveyard, sewers, disco, the beach at redpoint, rooftops at night,
    alcoholic's home, churches, Uukuniemi, foggy fields, sauna, my bed.""
    This is a personal quest, and its hard to say if they
    succeeded, but <em>Yhä hämärää</em> possesses the magical giddiness of an
    unknown radio station tapped into momentarily while traveling
    unfamiliar back roads. When the signal bows out after the next hill,

It's not a fair question, but it's
    an easy one to ask once you've heard the seven-track <em>In the Reins, the first in what, if
    we're all very lucky, will be a series of collaborations between Iron &amp;
    Wine and Calexico.</em></p><p>
    
    Iron &amp; Wine's Beam and Calexico's Joey Burns sound
    heavenly harmonizing with each other, especially when guest
    vocalist Natalie Wyants joins them. Neither is an exceptional
    vocalist on his own, both occasionally lapsing to a whisper, but those
    hushed, gently melodic cords singing in unison make magic. Beam is the
    principle songwriter and vocalist on the album, and he's written some A
    material for the record, admirably putting his all into it instead of
    offering up some throwaway stuff and hoping Calexico can do something with
    it.</p><p>
    
    What ultimately ends up happening is Calexico's sense of cinematic
    grandeur and eclecticism imbues Beam's melodies and lyrics with an
    expansiveness that his humid Floridian folk doesn't usually have. Shades of
    jazz and country creep in, and they even tackle straightahead
    California pop on ""History of Lovers"". The only ingredients from Calexico's usual recipe
    that are absent are dub and mariachi, but they employ their arsenal so
    sympathetically to Beam's vision that an unschooled listener might never
    guess that this wasn't a proper, working band.</p><p>
    
    Calexico are no
    strangers to backing other singers-- Burns and drummer John Convertino began
    playing together as Howe Gelb's rhythm section in Giant Sand, and they've
    contributed to dozens of LPs by other artists over the years. The core duo
    of Calexico brings along most of the collective of Southwestern musicians
    that enlivens their own albums-- Paul Niehaus's lap steel, in particular,
    helps to shape the sound of the album. ""Prison on Route 41"" and ""16, Maybe
    Less"" both traffic in hushed country 'n' western tones, but are arranged in such a way that vocals give way to instrumental
    passages so smoothly that the solos don't feel at all like showcases.</p><p>
    
    There isn't a disappointing song on the EP (mini-album might actually be a
    better word for it), but it's worth noting a couple of stand-outs. Opener
    ""He Lays in the Reins"" is a subtle waltz stuffed with flourishes of acoustic
    guitar and brushed drums that almost two minutes in introduces the operatic
    Spanish vocals of Salvador Duran, a complete leftfield move that proves as
    inspired on subsequent listens as it does jarring on the first listen. But
    the real highlight is also the biggest shock: ""History of Lovers"" is what
    Fleetwood Mac's <em>Rumours</em> might have sounded like if it had been recorded in
    Memphis, complete with steel guitar trim and a great horn arrangement to go
    with some stunning harmonies and an unbelievable vocal melody.</p><p>
    
    Whether or not Iron &amp; Wine and Calexico ever choose to follow this up with
    another collaboration (fingers crossed), it's clear that both acts are
    stronger for having worked with the other. It'll be interesting
    to see what comes next for Iron &amp; Wine and Calexico and how this affects
    their work apart from each other. In the meantime, we can hope that this
    isn't a one-time-only engagement.</p></div>"|4129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4129-in-the-reins-ep/|8.5|Joe Tangari

This setback forced the group to hastily re-shuffle their recording strategy, as they were required to utilize a jerry-rigged assortment of electronics and loops to drive the album's blearily muted melodic clatter. And though McLeod is back at full-strength for the Double's Matador debut <em>Loose in the Air</em>, the group's experience with on-the-fly problem solving continues to hold them in good stead, as they here constantly labor to reconcile the conflicting personality traits inherent in their nettlesome music.</p><p>
    
    Produced by Steve Revitte, who's recently worked with Black Dice and the Liars, <em>Loose in the Air</em> features several episodes of such pure stray dissonance that one might prematurely conclude the Double are ready to emerge as a full-fledged noise act. But these frequent, consciously misshapen crescendos often stand in opposition to the group's more conditioned 1960s rock movements and wiry dub figures, and in direct contention with David Greenhill's shivery, metropolitan vocals and the occasional undisguised Ray Manzarek flourish from keyboardist Jacob Morris. At peak altitude the album's relentless, destabilized push-pull can create exquisite levels of unresolved tension, but all too often, when their many disparate elements fail to crystallize, the Double can begin to merely resemble a lesser Interpol equipped with a vintage Vox Continental organ and misfiring rayguns.</p><p>
    
    One trait <em>Loose in the Air</em> noticeably shares with <em>Turn On the Bright Lights</em> is a distinct shortage of laughs, or even courteous smiles, as the men of the Double here knit their brows resolutely towards the skylines. Seemingly every track carries vague messages of some imminent, unnamed trouble, as Greenhill's desperate lyrics struggle to make themselves intelligible above the music's potent static. On the lurching, powerful ""On Our Way"", such lines as ""The radio turns itself up...the continent's turned on its side"" intermittently bubble through like transmissions from a bad satellite feed, while on the following ""Hot Air"", Morris' sinister carnival organ takes over to sweat out an urgent post-punk ""Five To One"" pulse.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the album, the Double are at their best on patiently-built tracks like the throbbing, wormwood dub of ""Up All Night"" or the seven-minute epic ""Dance"", both of which rise by increments to reach impressive, shrieking heights of amp feedback and distorted electronics. Less compelling, however, are those songs they attempt to drive headlong into more conventional popcraft, such as the perfunctory indie bounce ""Icy"" or the freeze-dried grunge of ""What Sound It Makes the Thunder"", an overcooked stomp that simply begs for the type of unhinged performance that the Double seem unwilling (or unable) to give it. These periodic lapses of over-constraint are especially disappointing given the group's obvious talent for making spontaneous mid-air adjustments to their sound; but there's enough evidence here to be optimistic that one day soon the group will gain the swagger necessary to more consistently abandon themselves to their wilder sonic impulses.</p></div>"|2553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2553-loose-in-the-air/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

Most of his lyrical efforts on Hail Social's debut are as vibrantly decorative as gold glitter, and just about as empty (no dis-- the Rakes half foot-shot their debut with <em>poignant</em> lyrics, and Hail Social comes off better being pretty vacant). But if you're into the pat unity that symbolism provides, you can read it like that: An oblique invocation of alienated distress and wayward transmissions to put a sinister twist on the invitation to ""Come out tonight/ There will be someone waiting."" Really though, those six syllables are just a handy pivot between the crunchy guitars of the chorus and the blocky bass of the next verse. The unthinking man's Franz Ferdinand won't make you reexamine your heteronormative assumptions, but you might feel like going out.</p><p>
    
    Then again, maybe there's more to it-- after breezing through the nine remarkably easy-to-listen-to tracks on this album, it's not hard to imagine that ""radio, radio"" is Hawk staking out his territory. Some of you will hate Hail Social on principle, catching a whiff of crass commoditization, and maybe you'll even lose respect for Interpol for ""putting them on."" After all, this Philly band just burst out of nowhere and snagged a <em>Spin</em> ""Band of the Nanosecond"" clip for their press file, armed with LCD Soundsystem bass pulsation, staccato new-new-wave guitars, Rick Oca-slick type production and Duran Duran arena stomp, an emo falsetto in a post-punk mask. All of these snap together to create the spiky, measured turbulence of opener ""Hands are Tied"". You know those gum-machine toys, where you have to get a bunch of oddly-shaped pieces to fit together in a perfect sphere? Like that. ""I met her, and I walked away/ A mess of emotion,"" Hawk belts. Tough guy/ Sensitive guy total package, anyone? Yep, it's gonna be that kind of party.</p><p>
    
    Another camp will dislike it on first blush, but find themselves helplessly won over in the long run (stop by my tent and say hello, we can rock out to Hail Social, Stellastarr*, and Longwave in likeminded company). And diehard popists will wish Hail Social had gone even further in distilling every fuck-all trendy modern trope into one shining pop gloss. But everyone should agree that this debut is the model of efficiency: One singer, one guitar, bass, drums, and even these are deployed sparely. The bass favors rigid polygons, gliding on ""Repetition"", sparring with handclaps on ""Get in the Car"". The guitar metes out crisp, syncopated leads that waste no notes in outlining the melodies, and Hawk's voice soars effortlessly over the open spaces. RIYL singing along, amping up your toilette before a night out, fun. </p></div>"|4022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4022-hail-social/|7.0|Brian Howe

    twee-as-feck Britfop Stephen Coates. (The really real Tuesday Weld is
    an Elvis-dating, Dudley Moore-divorcing pin-up turned Oscar nominee,
    but anyway that's not her real name.) After loosely basing 2004's
    excellent <em>I, Lucifer</em> on a Glen Duncan novel, Coates ballasts
    his latest Prohibition-era cocktail cruise with another loveboatload
    of conceits-- vague storyline, vaguer alter ego, and the ever-loved
    love/death dichotomy-- but <em>The Return of the Clerkenwell Kid</em> is
    ultimately an exercise in déjà vu: the feeling you've been to this
    electro-lounge before.</p><p>
<em>Return</em>
    revisits a baker's dozen of tracks from the Weld's 2001 debut,
    <em>Where Psyche Meets Cupid</em>, albeit with fresh recordings and a
    smattering of, ahem, real new material. Also recurring is Coates'
    self-described ""antique beat"" style, which in itself mingles the
    long-ago with the recent: Twenties and '30s music-hall and Tin Pan Alley
    (via ""When I'm Sixty-Four"", <em>Village Green</em>-preserving Kinks, or
    tourmate/fan Stephin Merritt of Magnetic Fields) with copious sampling
    and light, pastoral electronics of the Saint Etienne school. Scratchy
    victrola-like sound effects and sly clarinet-playing enliven
    resurrected tracks like banjo-picker ""Am I in Love?"" as well as the
    newbies, including instrumental opener ""Waking Up"" and melodramatic
    ballad ""Little White Birds"". Pun-picking ""Daisies"" adds a bossa nova
    rhythm.</p><p>
    More than just another case of history repeating, <em>Return</em> really
    makes you think twice. With whirring electronic beats and
    ever-slinkier clarinet, ""L'amour et La Morte"" strips Coates'
    love-and-death theme what the French call ass-naked. ""Got a heart like
    an exit wound,"" Coates breathily half-sings behind his usual
    telephone-like filter (a more confident presentation would better suit
    the ambitious arrangements). The songs trace an apparently romantic
    relationship from the sprightly, unsuspecting acoustic guitar of
    ""Anything But Love"" to the wry ""Goodbye Stephen"", in which Coates
    envisions his own demise (""Will my family and friends all turn out to
    wave/ Dressed in their best fine nice things to say?""). Between, ""I
    Love the Rain"" offers porn wah-wah, distant piano lines,
    didgeridoo-like noises and the admonition to ""let's get wet"". Newbie
    ""Something Beautiful"" goes alpha beta gaga with multi-part vocal
    harmonies.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, <em>Return</em> misfires more often than its
    predecessors, omitting the debut's great ""Terminally Ambivalent Over
    You"" and never living up to <em>I, Lucifer</em>'s inspired scat-dance
    single ""Bathtime in Clerkenwell"". Overly precious ""Lavender Hill"", in
    particular, suffers by comparison (uh, is that acoustic guitar intro
    from ""Free Falling""?). When his conceits pay off, though, Coates
    appends a few charming, eclectic revisions to music history and his
    own. On a song called ""Déjà Vu"", his whisper takes on Waitsian
    darkness: ""This touch on your skin reminds you of/ What was it again?""
    The feeling you've been to this electro-lounge before...</p></div>"|6704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6704-the-return-of-the-clerkenwell-kid/|6.9|Marc Hogan

The drummer practices some rolls, a buzzing input jack is plugged in, a firecracker goes off, and then somebody shouts ""1, 2, 3, 4!"", miraculously transmuting this rambunctious rehearsal into a clean-cut, impeccably sequenced full-length. Nearly every rock band's done it, and for the listener who really wants to connect, it's great playacting. Thus, in four seconds of fuzz and feedback, power-pop hucksters OK Go kick off their second LP with said theatrical flair and continue the charade for 13 rigid, self-conscious tracks.</p><p>
    Mimicry is one thing, but at least choose wisely. You see, OK Go decide to impersonate post-<em>Pinkerton</em>, post-catchy, fun-by-numbers Weezer, resulting in an Ivy Leaguer Sugar Ray sound. Worse yet, they keep one thumb in whatever pie MTV currently deems popular. Their summery self-titled debut cashed in on the short-lived Phantom Planet/Rooney craze, and <em>Oh No</em> egregiously hangs on the new wave bandwagon like a barnacle. If that chunky, clumsy riff on single ""Do What You Want"" sounds familiar, it should. Producer Tore Johansson tries to inject dance-rock into <em>Oh No</em>, apparently using leftover scraps from his Franz Ferdinand sessions. Unfortunately, the infusion sticks out like a rejected kidney, and Johansson often concedes to OK Go's smarmy schlock rock.</p><p>
    Frontman Damian Kulash calls most of the shots here, and not surprisingly, his frat boy spin on Elvis Costello shows marginal progress since ""You're So Damn Hot"". When he's not screaming ""come on!"" or ""hey!"", Kulash's razor wit tackles an array of subjects ranging from women to girls to chicks. His poetics may not run deep, but they certainly go on forever. Opener ""Invincible"", this album's ""Get Over It"", is meat-and-potatoes arena rock documenting Kulash's bizarre metaphor about a superhero girl who saves the world from aliens: ""When they finally come to destroy the earthÉthey won't know about the thousand Fahrenheit hot metal lights behind your eyes."" Damian Kulash majored in semiotics at Brown University, just throwing that out there.</p><p>
    So okay I get it, these guys are a ""fun"" band, and that's great, I love fun. Why, though, does their music play by such strict rules? Their only curveballs thrown here are Beach Boys harmonies and the same augmented chord progression, and even these twists are rationed. While their debut at least sported some guilty pleasure material, <em>Oh No</em> is too self-conscious for serious hooks to flourish. For what it's worth, Kulash still shows a nose for catchiness on humbler, mid-tempo songs, and without it, I wouldn't be touching this album with a 39-and-a-half-foot pole. From the impeccable touchstones to the knack for melody, everything's in place for these guys. However, as <em>Oh No</em>'s first four seconds of guitar noodling forecast, these guys simply try too hard. </p></div>"|5958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5958-oh-no/|2.2|Adam Moerder

A year later, <em>Cripple Crow</em> provides, in a sense, the loose-knit scene's strongest group effort to date.  Banhart's fourth album isn't a compilation, nor is it billed as a group project, but he's assembled such a rich cast of cohorts here, it feels more like the fruit of community interaction than the product of a lone singer/songwriter.</p><p>  The communal vibe is hinted at by the album's artwork: Rather than adorning the cover with his usual calligraphic scribbles, Banhart offers a composite photo of ""The Family"" (a term he often ascribes to his musical friends), gathered beneath a large knotty tree and accompanied by the disembodied heads of smiling spirits.  <em>Sgt. Pepper</em> is the obvious point of departure, though unlike the Beatles' classic, there are no numbered silhouettes in the liner notes to decode the relative anonymity of the photo subjects. Fittingly, the only immediately recognizable figure is Banhart himself, crouching front and center, wings spread wide.</p><p>  The artwork conjures Native America, an attribute Banhart seemingly alluded to in a recent email exchange, admitting that he's ""a little terrified at how white most of the people are,"" but reassuring me that ""68% of the people on the cover have Native American blood.""  Indeed, Banhart strives for ethnic diversity on <em>Cripple Crow</em>, boasting the highest concentration of Spanish-sung tracks of any of his albums (he was raised in Venezuela where Spanish was his mother tongue), and finding him moving further beyond ""freak"" territory and into a worldly blend of various exotic approaches.  Banhart has always experimented with method and sound, but he's never before approached <em>Cripple Crow</em>'s expertise and variety.  In all its obvious details, the album not only finds Banhart coming into his own as a songwriter and performer, but suggests future directions for the 24-year-old as well.</p><p>  Having started out on primitive recorders and four-track machines, Banhart only recently graduated to proper studios, and <em>Cripple Crow</em> further increases fidelity, possessing a warmer, more pristine quality.  His vocals, too, often draped in slight reverb, are especially assured and less flaky than on previous outings.  And as mentioned above, an ensemble cast showed up to back him: There's best chum Andy Cabic (aka Vetiver), Noah Georgeson (of Joanna Newsom's old rock band the Pleased, and producer of <em>The Milk-Eyed Mender</em>), and Thom Monohan (Pernice Brother and production whiz).  The cast also includes members of Currituck Co., Espers, Yume Bitsu, The Blow, Feathers, CocoRosie, and others.  Basically, it's a traveling band of hippies excited about Donovan who aren't afraid to rock.</p><p>  On <em>Oh Me Oh My</em>'s ""Roots"", Banhart sang, ""I don't play rock 'n' roll.""  All that's changed.  <em>Cripple Crow</em> features an explosion of psychedelic R&amp;R stuffs.  ""Long Haired Child"" maneuvers a three-pronged guitar attack-- Adam Forkner's distorted noodling, Banhart's wah-wah, and acoustic coupling-- backed with Otto Hauser's drums and Jona Bechtolt's percussion.  ""Lazy Butterfly"" is memorable for Cabic's closely mic'd backing vocals and a tambora sheen along with hand drums and guitars.  And ""Little Boys"", which Banhart alleges is sung from the perspective of a schizophrenic Hermaphrodite, is divided in half by a mid-song bass change-up which shifts the song up from a sorta boring Oldham prom-dance lament to its sinister, surfy refrain: ""I see so many little boys I wanna marry/ I see plenty little kids I've yet to had.""</p><p>  Juxtaposed against a number of upbeat rock tracks, Banhart's quieter, more introspective material often makes a stronger impact. ""Dragonflies"", a whispered duet between Banhart and Matteah Baim of Metallic Falcons, flutters by in less than a minute with a cryptically tender lyricism.  Likewise, album opener ""Now That I Know"" is one of his most beautiful and controlled tracks yet. It finds him backed only by cello and his own guitar, in confessional: ""12 years old/ In [my] mama's clothes/ Shut the blinds and lock up every door/ And if you hear someone's coming near/ Just close your eyes it'll make 'em disappear.""</p><p>  Elsewhere, on ""Heard Somebody Say"", there's a sense of protest, with Feathers' lovely vocals adding witch-hunt background layers. Banhart gently lays down the thesis-- ""Heard somebody say the war ended today/ But everybody knows it's going still""-- before winding around to the chill-inducing punchline, the easiest anti-war slogan ever: ""It's simple, we don't want to kill.""  Later, he tries out Dylan rhyme schemes on ""I Feel Just Like a Child"", while ""Some People Ride the Wave"" is Louis Armstrong with New Orleans toy jazz (""some people write the songs that stay inside our souls""); ""The Beatles"" lets it be known that ""Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are the only Beatles in the world"" before shifting gears into Spanish; Pangea and various fertility myths are given new legs in ""Chinese Children""; and endless love song ""Korean Dogwood"" tells as thorough an elliptical story as Banhart's tackled.</p><p>  Banhart's ambition is apparent throughout, but at 22 tracks and almost 75 minutes, the album does stretch its legs too long.  Though it feels like an attempt to document as thoroughly as possible his late winter retreat to Woodstock, any more experienced mystics will tell you that blanks, dissolves, gaps, and other ingredients for mystery could've made it even richer. Still, <em>Cripple Crow</em> is undoubtedly impressive, vastly singular but entirely accessible, and an inspired listening experience where Banhart again proves himself one of the more talented and charismatic forces in modern music.</p><p> </p></div>"|553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/553-cripple-crow/|8.4|Brandon Stosuy

You'll need:<br/>
    * A penchant for vintage organs and recording equipment.<br/>
    * A love of light pop, psychedelia, and krautrock from the mid-60s through the mid-70s. (Extra credit: a not-so-dormant completist streak.)<br/>
    * Hard leftist politics are suggested, but not required. However, you will be expected to have a fetish for vocal harmonies and wordless lyrics.<br/>
    * A strong will in the face of legions of kids saying how much better Stereolab used to be.<br/>
    * Perhaps more importantly, an easygoing nature: remember, you can't mind repetition or fluorescent colors.</p><p>
    
    Stereolab are as reliable an institution as anything you'll encounter in formal education. After umpteen albums, EPs, singles, and compilations, that they maintain the fan base they do says a lot for the number of sturdy, aesthetically sound ideas they've produced. In the academic world, the band would be akin to a tenured professor, long past her prime and not producing much groundbreaking research, but beloved by her students (and not just because her classes are easy As). Nevertheless, one has to carefully weigh the options when considering investing in new Stereolab music: Yes, the quality is good, but what is its shelf life? Since school and new records are expensive, perhaps we should survey the coursework for their recent trio of 7-inch singles (also made available online as a digital EP) to see if they make the grade.</p><p>
    
    The two-parted ""Kyberneticka Babicka"" is like a lost backing track from the Beach Boys' ill-fated <i>Landlocked</i> sessions, fitting somewhere between ""'Til I Die"" and obscure bed-period Brian Wilson things like ""Loop de Loop"" or ""When Girls Get Together"". Vocals harmonies are layered seven people thick, spilling into my lap like milk halfway to ice cream. Stereolab are still masters of gorgeous repetition, maddening though it may be to listen to eight or so minutes of the same two chord sequences. In fact, unusual for the band, these vocals may actually <em>be looped, which lends the tracks (separated in name only, this two-parter sounds like a one-parter sliced to fit within 7-inches of vinyl) an almost inhuman character-- and that's a realm in which Stereolab often resides. However, I can respect this track: The ""melody"" is almost non-existent save some overtones poking out of the vocal harmonies, but like all the best minimalism, the end result is deceptively engaging, lulling me into hypnosis one minute, up to my ears in dairy-laden ecstasy the next. Course credit: A-</em></p><p>
    
    ""Plastic Mile"" and ""I Was a Sunny Rainphase"" are much more conventional, which in Groop terms equates to more variations on the Chicago post-rock period sound of the band's post-<em>Emperor Tomato Ketchup catalog. The former tune is a mildly kaleidoscopic (though even-keeled to a fault) song that doesn't quite live up to its sleeve's day-glo cover art. Laetitia Sadier sings a high-pitched, occasionally hushed melody, surrounded by a pleasant array of vocal counterpoint lines, trumpets, Farfisa, and a chill vibe the Free Design would have killed for. And yes, that could describe any number of Stereolab's songs, but I doubt you'll be complaining I mislead you when you hear it. ""I Was a Sunny Rainphase"" is more upbeat, sounding like one of the rockier tracks on </em><em>ETK (or hey, <i>Margarine Eclipse</i>). There's a break in the middle where everything slows down, trumpets swell, clavinets, er, clav, and what should be an introduction to the bridge gets stretched over and right back into the verse. Removing the expected details of pop music is one of the band's strongest points, but in comparison to ""Kyberneticka Babicka"", it feels like a belabored one. Course credit: B-</em></p><p>
    
    The final installment of the singles features two more up-tempo songs, ""Interlock"" and ""Visionary Roadmaps"". The first begins like an old-school Motown jam, with a drum-fill straight into Northern Soul stomp. No, Sadier never ends up belting a vocal like Major Lance, but for a few minutes anyway, she maintains the opening momentum with catchy, syncopated refrains like, ""What good is all this knowledge we've acquired in the face of deep Nihilism?"" ""Visionary Roadmaps"" borrows the beat from its A-side, using a slightly altered melody and an even slightly-er different chord progression. And Brent bless them, they sing ""ba ba ba"" at the end. Of course, you've heard this all before-- from Stereolab and me-- and while it's never unpleasant, it's not exactly memorable. Course credit: C</p><p>
    
    And just like the die-hards stayed with Brian Wilson throughout the 70s, no amount of unsurprising Stereolab music will sway fans much. In fact, I'm going to play ""Kyberneticka Babicka"" a few more times, and watch the others dissolve into the stew of their discography. As these things go, a B-average isn't bad.</p></div>"|7504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7504-kyberneticka-babicka-ep/|7.1|Dominique Leone

    (legal and otherwise) is going to hasten the death of the album. I don't buy it. I think what's really happening is that
    the two media, short and long formats, have reached something of an
    equilibrium point where certain music is best presented in an album context,
    while singles are better for others. Which is entirely logical.</p><p>
    
    Even in spite of their prodigious pop songwriting chops, Apollo Sunshine fall more into the album camp, as their approach to
    melodious rock 'n' roll is gleefully chaotic, full of too many
    influences to properly enumerate them and inclined to stretch the
    conventions of media like so much sweet taffy. When I say they swing on a
    dime from charging rock to hushed balladry to back porch jams to plaintive
    country, I mean it. These songs don't seem to mind completely reinventing
    themselves halfway through, interrupting what you thought was a quiet,
    emotional song about feeling displaced in the world with a dive-bombing
    instrumental passage that flits between new wave and bottom-heavy groove.
    This is what happens on opener ""Flip!"", where the narrator implores the
    stars for advice and they tell him to ""keep breathing.""</p><p>
    
    Apollo Sunshine's worldview, as their name suggests, is generally bright and hopefult, though it's tinged with enough uncertainty to
    provide tension. All four members sing (they've gained one member since
    their debut, 2003's wildly inventive <em>Katonah</em>), often harmonizing
    when you'd least expect it, such as singing stacked ""woo-oohs"" in the midst
    of a raging guitar squall on ""Phyllis"". Song titles
    make an interesting word-association string: ""Magnolia"", ""Phyllis"", ""God"",
    ""Lord"", and ""Bed"". The music sounds free-associative, too, and there's
    little consideration given to restraint. They're inspired to yell on the
    wailing Southern rock stomper ""Lord"", and so they do, with wild abandon, Sam
    Cohen and Jesse Galalgher shredding vocal chords over the muscular rhythms
    of new recruit Sean Aylward and drummer Jeremy Black.</p><p>
    
    When I lived in the band's home base of Boston,
    Black and Cohen played together in a band called Ca$h. Ca$h were a good
    band, with some excellent songs (""Smash Your Radio"" even got some ironic
    airplay), but it was identifiably pop-punk; it had a genre. Even then, there
    were hints of the complex song structure they're into now with Apollo
    Sunshine, but this new band has no real genre outside of made-up,
    adjective-loaded hybrids like ""manic, free-associative pop"" or something
    like that. There are great stand-alone songs here, like the 1960s-at-78-rpm
    sugar rush of ""Eyes"", but Apollo Sunshine is best listened to in a full dose
    and appreciated in all its messy glory.</p></div>"|404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/404-apollo-sunshine/|7.8|Joe Tangari

For fans who've been following them closely, hearing the occasional electronic detour in their meat-and-potatoes rock stew, <em>The Curious City</em> is the sound of your band all grown up. Compared to previous album <em>Thunder + Lightning</em> there's more melody, more ambitious structures, more psychedelic detours, and more surprises here.</p><p>
    
    ""Bucket of Butterflies"" sets the tone, moving from a sludgy, lumbering opening riff into a lighter, melodic shuffle through strummed sparkling pop into a three-note Disney villain gallop onto a snarling chorus and adroitly back to square one to start again. The streamlined ""Sleepwalkers"" is little less flashy, but still weaves electronic and psychedelic influences into a sleek whole, and the ghostly organs on the bouncy ""In Another Land"" provide some of the album's most psych-rock moments. They can also pull back and quiet down, as on the melodramatic mid-tempo ""In the Cemetery"", and the record's lyrics are sung with clarity and restraint.</p><p>
    
    The fluidity dulls some of the immediate punch of the songs might have otherwise-- the brief chorus to ""Bucket of Butterflies"" would make a fine song itself if the band wanted to keep things static-- but seamlessness is it's most impressive quality, especially following the apparently simple <em>Thunder + Lightning</em>. That old band appears every once in a while, popping up for a moment in ""Bucket of Butterflies"" or the reckless riffage and wailing of ""Mr. Mercedes"" like a hand gripping the inside brim of a boiling cauldron, but never for more than a moment.</p><p>
    
    The relentless shifting works best when not spending too long on any one idea, and when leaning on the monumental drumming of Paul Quattrone. ""Bucket of Butterflies"" is ably carried through hairpin turns in tempo and rhythm, and scurrying keyboard riffs like the one to ""Red Lights"" are pummeled senseless. Without Quattrone, the band couldn't get away with all this.</p><p>
    
    They don't get away with everything, though; The organ drenched ""Fingers, Drains"" gets bogged down in execution, and while the acoustic plucking of ""Countries"" is a pleasant change in sound, it's not nearly as captivating. Plus, the groove to the closing ""Trapped Rabbits"" is deadly, but not enough to sustain its 16-minute runtime. But that's another surprise: These 10 tracks feel epic with all their twists and turns, but rarely exceed the five-minute mark, and lose none of the urgency of the band's earlier work.</p></div>"|5662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5662-the-curious-city/|7.5|Jason Crock

And one didn't have to listen long to the crackled textures of Holy Letters' deeply evocative outsider folk-blues to detect Usui's influence on Chasny's subsequent work. Since then, the two musicians have cultivated an extensive correspondence which has now culminated in the formation of August Born. Collaborating by way of tapes exchanged in the mail, August Born's debut album finds the duo attempting to overcome the barriers of language and distance to quarry their substantial expanses of musical and spiritual common ground.</i></p><p>
    
    In addition to his multi-instrumental work as L, Usui has made wide-ranging experimental music with underground luminaries Keiji Haino in Fushitsusha and various members of Ghost in Marble Sheep. Here, however, August Born maintain a respectful simplicity in their partnership. Most of these tracks are constructed from spare, interwoven splinters of banjo, amp feedback, muffled percussion, and various found sounds in accompaniment to Chasny's distinctive finger-picked guitars, while both musicians take turns trading blurred vocals. Usui's music is heavily steeped in rural American blues-- as evidenced by his spectral version of Blind Willie Johnson's ""Cold Was the Ground"" on <i>Holy Letters</i>-- and his playing here results in several performances that are as traditional as anything Chasny has previously put his hand to. And though the limitations of its recording process can make the album seem like a fragmentary sketchbook, it also contains in its depths glowing coals that could only have been sparked by the collision of such similarly high-charged, inspiriting talents.</p><p>
    
    As is often the case with mail-based collaborations-- Christina Carter &amp; Loren Connor's <em>Meditations on the Ascension of Blind Joe Death, for instance-- listening to August Born's loose dialogue feels like eavesdropping on an intercepted cell phone conversation. Voices speak over one another, phrases are inadvertently interrupted, and promising leads not followed up. ""Birds &amp; Sun &amp; Clay"" sounds like a pleasant but uneventful outtake from Six Organs's </em><em>School of the Flower, while on ""Song of the Dead"" the two musicians lightly paw around ideas, each perhaps too deferentially waiting for the other to make something happen.</em></p><p>
    
    But then there are the moments that, with little advance warning, the duo manage to achieve offhanded heights of an enthralling symbiosis. ""More Dead Bird Blues"" grows out of Usui's incantatory vocal to become a weightless volley of skeletal guitar, gauzy voices and shimmering percussion, a hypnotic exchange that carries over to the following ""Last Breath of the Bird"", as if the two were reflecting beams of sunlight to one another via handheld mirrors. And as the album closes with the electric hum of ""A Lot Like You"" and the intimate guitar of ""You Will Be Warm"", it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish one musician from the other, their individual voices gradually converging into the same ungrounded tongue, and leaving one with the hope that this proves to be merely the beginning of a long and mutually beneficial association.</p></div>"|484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/484-august-born/|7.3|Matthew Murphy

For the most part, the record-- organized by charity War Child to aid Bosnian children victimized by war in the Balkans-- was an artistic as well as a humanitarian triumph, offering the first airing of Radiohead's ""Lucky"", almost two years prior to <i>OK Computer</i>, and featuring excellent tracks from the Boo Radleys, Oasis, Orbital, Portishead, the KLF (as The One World Orchestra), and others.</p><p>
    Ten years later, the War Child organization has repeated the effort, pulling together 22 indie-friendly UK artists to record tracks with the results, <i>Help: A Day in the Life, <u><a href=""http://www.7digital.com/shops/default.aspx?shop=15"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">for sale</a></u> as downloads the following day. (A CD version of the project will be released on Independiente later this month.) In order to aim its quick turnaround, initial pressings of the 1995 charity disc offered no tracklisting or list of contributors, neither of which was missed-- most artists were easily identifiable: Indeed, of those who contributed to the original </i><i>Help!, only </i><i>Kerrrang! fave Terrorvision and third-tier Britpop band Salad are now mostly forgotten-- and the latter was propped up on the comp by dueting with the Specials' Terry Hall. Had listeners been forced to guess who's who on the current </i><i>Help disc, it would have been much more difficult to distinguish between a largely faceless group of meat-and-potatoes guitar pop acts and new wave revivalists.</i></p><p> 
    Sadly, the most telling thing about the record is its condemnation of the UK's indie-minded gatekeepers in the years since Britpop. The first <i>Help!</i> took place just a few weeks after the Blur-Oasis chart battle, a moment when Britpop's creativity was crashing but its popularity and the belief that its success was tied to England's national identity was ebbing. It <i>felt like a time when normally tangential artists could command the spotlight, and to their great credit they did so in order to boost War Child.</i></p><p>
    It was also around this time when Britpop quickly devolved into retro-obssessed conservatism where ambition was equated with chart success rather than artistry, and the best way to reclaim the glories of mid-Sixties British guitar rock was to lazily build MOR bridges to the past. Ten years later the UK indie circuit is so unadventurous and tepid that we have the editor-in-chief of the <i>NME scrunching his nose up at Antony and the Johnsons' Mercury Prize win, calling an album of gorgeous cabaret-pop ""too weird"" for his audience. So step forward Keane, the Zutons, the Coral, Damien Rice, Elbow, Hard-Fi, Razorlight, Kaiser Chiefs, etc., and take your seat at the current <em>Help!</em></i> table, where, unsurprisingly, none of them punch above their weight.</p><p>
    The biggest draw on the disc is a new Radiohead track. That song, ""I Want None of This"", is no ""Lucky"" but it's one of the disc's highlights-- Thom on a piano in his maudlin, ""You and Whose Army?"" mold, mixing funeral dirge with finger-waggling. Many others chose slower tempos as well, such as the usually nervy neo-wave bands Maxïmo Park, Hard-Fi, and Bloc Party, and the all-action Go! Team, with only the last two delivering quality tracks. Belle &amp; Sebastian continue to toss curveballs: Their ""The Eighth Station of the Cross Kebab House"", with its elastic bass and off-kilter percussion, could have fit nicely on the <em>Books</em> EP. Pete Doherty's Babyshambles, the Magic Numbers, Sudanese-born hip-hop artist Emmanual Jal, and Coldplay all run in place.</p><p>
    Antony is here, dueting with Boy George, on a mundane reading of ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"". Covers of ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" (Keane with Faultline) and ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" (the Kasier Chiefs) were more puzzling choices. Both are breakup songs-- one about a young gay man leaving his sugar daddy; the other sees the jilted learning his fate through heresay and rumor-- and neither work. Keane's effort is largely innocuous, while the Chiefs' grasp at replicating a mix of ""Ghost Town""-style dub and dread and the Slits' own frenetic ""Grapevine"" cover falls flat.</p><p>
    So here's the pride of UK indie, and the best tracks are from a cartoon band and a group from Mali. Damon Albarn-- one of three holdovers from the first set (along with Radiohead and the Manic Street Preachers)-- does a 180 from ""Eine Kleine Lift Musik"", the woozy music-hall ballad he and Blur offered 10 years ago. Here he slips into pan-global mode with the rather haunting, almost reflective ""Hong Kong"", which sounds more like his longtime band's <i>Think Tank than a Gorillaz track. Tuareg band Tinariwen, an influence on Albarn, and their Tishoumaren rebel music nicely fits the theme of the record-- the band formed in a refugee camp in the 1980s-- and the drony track projects a blend of weariness and spaciousness, solitary anguish and a need for community.</i></p><p>
    What's missing this time around? Non-guitar music, for the most part. Ten years ago, Massive Attack, Orbital, Chemical Brothers (as remixers), Portishead, Andrew Weatherall and James Hardway, the Stereo MCs, Neneh Cherry, and the KLF all appeared, most of them offering positive contributions. This record's lone electronic artist, Mylo, does little to support the need for more of the same-- and the shoehorning of Dizzee Rascal into the dismal Band-Aid 20 release shows the peril of tokenism-- but it's still disappointing and indicative of the current UK indie mentality that rhythm is largely absent from this global charity record. It's also a fundamental failure of the organizers, who've drawn a narrow pool of artists at the detriment of the record's ultimate goal-- raising as much money as possible for War Child. It's not difficult to imagine that a wider variety of artists or the inclusion of pop, r&amp;b;, grime, and dance music would translate to a larger number of potential buyers.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the worthwhile project also risks becoming relatively lost amidst the outpouring of aid and money for Hurricane Katrina relief. On the face of it, the work of War Child-- providing assistance to children affected by war and conflict-- and hurricane relief are drastically different; one an ongoing, manmade problem and the other a natural disaster. In another sense, War Child does exactly what was not done for thousands of Katrina victims-- provide aid for those who can't help themselves. It's a deeply unfashionable idea in today's ""ownership society"" America, but just as Katrina horrifically demonstrated the failings of such policies, spotlighting the America that the architects of an ownership society seek to sweep under the rug, to abandon, to demonize even as they're being preyed upon within their own communities by those who use violence as an organizing tool and power grab, War Child seeks to do the same around the world.</p></div>"|2097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2097-help-a-day-in-the-life/|5.5|Scott Plagenhoef

The idea is fine, I
    guess. (Though, you know, beats <i>and rhymes.) But has any genre-- call it
    downtempo or trip-hop or whatever-- forced us
    to sit through more un-reconstituted dreck than rap-less rap? For every beat with a
    pretty texture over it, there are hundreds-- dozens on Ninja Tune and affiliates alone-- of canned breaks with
    keyb noodling or swiftly EQ'd samples. The '90s gave us worse plagues, but
    not by much.</i></p><p>
    
    Still, the one good thing about wallpaper is that it's just there. And
    unless it's screaming at you in neon green, well, then ignorability is part
    of the deal. So the scrap heap of milquetoast beats is more of an
    environmental problem than an aesthetic one. (I'm gonna call James Lavelle
    right now to bitch about his part in global warming.) But here's a few
    reasons why Dabrye's newly back-in-print 2002 mini-LP
    <em>Instrmntl</em> shouldn't be tarred with my (broad) brush.</p><p>
    
    1. Length: Dude, it's 30 minutes. There are plenty of things that can be
    done in 30 minutes that don't require a Ring Cycle to fill. Like
    brushing your teeth and shaving and having your coffee and reading the
    newspaper and walking to work. I did it this morning and I found the whole
    process invigorating. Or maybe I just didn't notice much. But when I did,
    there were some good beats. Does an instrumental hip-hop album need to be 80
    minutes? Does any album?</p><p>
    
    2. Warmth: Dabrye's first mini-LP, <em>One/Three</em>, had a bit of the tech-house chill
    to it, that ol' operating room funk. Like Zapp stranded in Antarctica until
    Roger Troutman's throat closed up and he needed mittens to operate his drum
    machines. Like Jam &amp; Lewis if they left the door to that Twin Cities studio
    open. (Okay, I'm reaching now.) Which, admittedly, was part of what gave it
    an identity. <em>Instrmntl</em> is much more ""organic"" (no, wait, come back), with
    punchy standup bass, buzzing keyboards, flutes (yes, I know). How deep is
    that bass on ""Take Me Home""? And why is it only 1:45? (A: See #1.)</p><p>
    
    3. Beats: Sure, a lot of it is canned Jay Dee, but whatever--it still works. It's the lack of reverb, those hard thwacks right down the middle
    of the snare. Or snipped handclaps (the
    power of truncated samples). Or lovingly sculpted, fatty kicks. Or the
    almighty cowbell. He gives the beats an apple-crisp snap or toothy pull you
    just can't get through faded breaks.</p><p>
    
    4. Catchiness: The thing is just catchy. The main reason is that Dabrye fills
    these little Joseph Cornell beat-boxes with so much just-so detail. Most
    downtempo is happy to loop a loop for six minutes and slip out for a smoke.
    There are the little keyboard vamps that playfully tug at the bass on
    ""Intrdctn"". The flute that darts like a kingfisher in ""Won"", before the
    whole track (claps, cowbell, stinging synths) drops out. But sometimes, as
    on ""Evelyn"", it's spare and still catchy, just fudge-thick keybs flecked
    with little white chocolate chips of filigree. As with any formula, some
    people are just more talented than others. It's just a shame that Dabrye,
    like Mr. Urban Tribe, gets lost in the sluice of funk fakers.</p></div>"|2623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2623-instrmntl/|7.9|Jess Harvell

The Jon Spencer side project has created a mirage of an album, a ghostly echo so light it's barely there. Talk about music that burrows in your brain: Spencer and fellow dumpster diver Matt Verta-Ray (Speedball Baby) ride a candy Cadillac on hypnosis spinners, pumping haunted psychobilly all the way to the asylum. It ain't always fun.</p><p>
    
    Cheeky, carnivalesque, brain-curdling-- who besides the completely delusional would actually enjoy this stuff? Probably the same people who fantasize breaking down at an abandoned gas station somewhere in the Nevada deep desert. Spencer's voice trembles over badlands vistas, stirring up all manners of strange sediment. Consider ""Dark Hair'd Rider"", one of the album's most stable cuts: Two curt guitar solos ride atop smoggy bashed toy cymbal, making you cough and wheeze.</p><p>
    
    Spencer's vox are still sick and dirty. If nothing else, give him credit for knowing how turn a perfectly nice blues-rock dance party into revulsive sex-drug splooge. Pared down from Blues Explosion's chunky chug, Heavy Trash build a sound primarily with drums and rollicking Epiphone. (Tube amp? Reverb? Check, check.) The most effective songs are the emptiest. ""The Loveless"" gets by on Spencer's oily curled-lip vocal, sounding not unfrightening against a hollowed-out two beat. He's ""a mean son of a bitch,"" ya know.</p><p>
    
    ""Gatorade"" is similarly discomforting. Feeling low, Spencer says to his baby, ""Fix me up fast with some, um, good first aid/ Hit me with a blast of that Gatorade."" The narrative continues over tip-toeing plucked guitar, cycling back to the vociferous-by-comparison chorus: ""Gatorade! Gatorade!/ Tastes so good, I'm amazed."" Creepiest part is the final, whispered ""Gatorade..."" at song's end. Could be the aging bluesman is subliminally, metaphorically, insidiously promoting drug use-- or just seeing who he can get to shit pants.</p><p>
    
    Straighter joints like ""The Hump"", which channels ancient Stones, sound good, but miss out on the intense visceral weirdness of the strictly guitar/drums howlers. So we kind of get two albums, and a dilemma. Daftness offset by songs like boot-stomper ""Lover Street"" and drippy ballad ""Fix These Blues,"" the album confounds. But a more consistent, non-capitulatory Heavy Trash would be basically unbearable, a free ride to the bughouse-- no longer a band, but a sentence.</p></div>"|4021.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4021-heavy-trash/|7.4|Sam Ubl

President Bush's approval rating had been wallowing below the 50-yard line for weeks even before the tragic delays in bringing aid to Katrina victims. Cindy Sheehan, in spite of all her ideological inaccuracies about the war, opened a national dialogue on its necessity. Even Republicans are starting to think twice as they head into mid-term elections without solid reasons for our Middle East adventure. So considering the current climate, one would think that Rob Swift's venture into the political sphere four years after 9/11 would be a welcome addition from one of the world's best DJs.</em></p><p>
    
    Instead, we get a lot of noise-- a muddled album of dissent with absolutely no teeth. The war's been a catalyst for a lot of useful and informative protest art, but pure anger and disgust is no substitute for astute and insightful political commentary. Case in point, the fictional Bush laughter on the ""Intro"" is totally ridiculous. Recreating Bush as Vincent Price at the end of ""Thriller"" does nothing to further discussion about our war policy. The excerpt from a news transcript of the Amadou Diallo's murder in New York on ""41 Bullets"" is certainly important, but has nothing to do with the <em>Wargames theme. Playing a clip of Bush speaking about 9/11 on ""The President Is Speaking"" seems to lend credibility to W. (""This is an enemy who preys on innocent and unsuspecting people, then runs for cover,"" the Prez says, but who argues with that?) ""Piano for Condeleezza"" is a just a piano riff for 1:11 and nothing more. That's it. If there's a stunning indictment in there, it's invisible. In fact, Swift gets away with 41 minutes of not saying anything at all.</em></p><p>
<em>Wargames only succeeds with hints at what could have been. On cuts like ""A Terror Wrist"", Swift makes like the Herbaliser and creates some real schizophrenia with shrill violins and creeping voice-overs. ""Military Scratch"" posts a similarly frightening urgency. Now if Swift used ominous tones like this to paint America with dystopian hues in a post-terrorist future, that'd be a statement. But as it stands </em><em>Wargames sounds like a lot of anti-war banter: a lot of complaints and ad hominems with no solutions, alternatives, or nuance.</em></p></div>"|7670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7670-wargames/|5.0|Jamin Warren

Something about <em>Agetis Byrjun</em>-- its celestial groping, its shimmers, its weird vastness-- seemed handcuffed to the landscape from which it was born. Thus, the mythology of Iceland-- of staggering literacy and longevity, of Björk, of Reykjavik, of volcanoes and fisheries and giant slabs of ice-- became the mythology of Sigur Rós. Unsurprisingly, domestic intrigue peaked almost immediately: The record's liner notes and cover-- a silver alien-baby hybrid boasting angel wings-- revealed precious little about its creation, and vocalist Jonsi Birgisson openly admitted to howling in an entirely self-fabricated language. In 2001, Sigur Rós were deliciously strange, the only sensible soundtrack to post-millennial comedowns, all future and faith, bones and blood and ice and sun, culled gently from an island far, far away.</p><p>
    In the years that followed, Sigur Rós released three EPs, reissued their debut, and popped out another full-length, the ever-contentious, unspeakable <em>( )</em>. With each new record, the band dutifully maintained their trademark swells, bowing consistently before the altar of ebb and flow, until Sigur Rós began to sound less like an icecap melting and more like Sigur Rós. The mystery melted, the fascination faltered, and the animated, barstool retellings of The Sigur Rós Story died down. Still, Sigur Rós are more than just a conversation piece, meatier than their reputation, better than the otherworldly blubbers they're so casually accused of: With <em>Takk</em>, the songcraft that once made <em>Agetis Byrjun</em> everyone's favorite sunrise record re-emerges intact. Melodies stick, songs coalesce, and Sigur Rós lay off the grim theatrics, reminding listeners everywhere that they intend to play theaters, not funeral homes.</p><p>
    Ultimately, <em>Takk</em> is a warmer, more orchestral take on the band's defining sound, and easily their most instantly accessible record to date (shockingly, over a third of the album's songs clock in at under five minutes each.) The cheerless drones of <em>( )</em> are replaced by more bass, drums, piano, horns, and samples, strings are more prominent than ever before, and Birgisson's lyrics are especially incidental, all barely-audible squeals and sighs. Mostly, <em>Takk</em> is ecstatic, constantly erupting in funny little waves of joy. Dissenters who rejected Sigur Rós as the soundtrack to wrist-slittings everywhere might be temporarily perplexed by the band's new, wide-eyed giggles-- but mostly, <em>Takk</em> just sounds like Sunday morning Sigur Rós, all yawns and sleepy grins and quick yanks at the curtains.</p><p>
    ""Glosoli"" is the record's shining center, a rapturous, tinkling swirl, with Birgisson's high, squeaky howls (sounding perfectly thin and kitten-y) shooting through a thick, stomping mess of chimes and echoing guitar. The song builds slowly, finally bursting in a deafening explosion of heavily-distorted guitar slams (think, oddly, of Coldplay-- particularly the end of <em>A Rush of Blood to the Head</em>'s ""Politik""). ""Glosoli"" manages to be both ethereal and concrete at the same time, which is Sigur Rós most effective trick: ""Glosoli"" tempers its fRóst with curls of hot human breath, a tongue on an icicle, frozen and warm all at once. ""Gong"" is all antsy drums and careering guitar, while the steamy ""Saeglopur"" tiptoes from piano and tinny glockenspiel to a breathtaking vocal harmony, and, finally, an ominous swell of full-band noise, just deep enough to inspire some vicious head-nods, if not full-hip dancing. Elsewhere, the band falters. ""Se Lest"" and ""Milano"", the record's longest cuts, are both vaguely hollow-- ""Se Lest"" is too preoccupied with its own atmospherics, while ""Milano"" meanders without meaning. </p><p>
<em>Takk</em> proves that Sigur Rós can, in fact, transcend their own legend: The tendency to descend into new age goo is still present, and <em>Takk</em>, like all of Sigur Rós' discography, is not for the viscerally-minded. Regardless, the record is more than just meaningless wisps. Crank it in the late summer heat and see if it melts. </p></div>"|7155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7155-takk/|7.8|Amanda Petrusich

His first record for the Sky Records (also home to LPs by Cluster &amp; Eno and Neu!'s Michael Rother)-- 1981's <i>Biotop-- sounded like the work of a composer obviously at home with discordant textures and off-kilter beats, yet had a patchwork, DIY charm belying his pedigree as a ""serious"" composer.

<p>1981's <i>Spät-Europa (or </i><i>Late Europe), like </i><i>Biotop</i> from earlier in the same year, sticks with short tunes as a matter of practice. Tietchens had planned to compose an album featuring nothing but two-minute songs, though without the benefit of a laptop or high-tech digital editing software, he settles for analog instrumentals ranging from 1:48 to just over two-and-a-half minutes. This kind of homemade efficiency is perfectly suited to his buoyant, if slightly out of focus instrumentals: ""Poanpo"" spirals upwards in waltz time, using mini-Moog electro-rays with a warped counterpoint; the title track, after a short, barely audible introduction of church bells and choral singing, pushes ahead at glacier pace, with its high-pitched, melancholy moan serving as a cold, lonely hymn. ""Ausverkauf"" picks up the pace, allowing some archaic drum machine to mimic Neu!'s Klaus Dinger while bizzaro-circus melodies fly by overheard. In fact, <i>Spät-Europa would make a fine soundtrack to an S&amp;M; fete taking place in the darkest corners of Berlin, replete with bruised mimes and aluminum-plated dancing boys.

""Aus dem Tag"" (""From the Day"") sounds almost benevolent compared to the semi-twisted pieces on <i>Spät-Europa, and long stretches of breezy synth lines coupled with faux-music box ambience lend the track a cartoonish charm. The lengthy title track is much darker, with cavernous echo and a minor-key bass ostinato lurching behind a minimal, elongated melody that gradually morphs into something more bouncy. The obviously synthesized tambourine adds to the modest industrial feel, though Tietchens version of synth pop is always a little on the queasy side of goth.

At a semi-luxury hotel a few kilometers from the coast, a sprawling complex of balconied buildings and a swimming pool nestled next to a stand of trees, a few hundred ravers in summer duds-- some in dirty Diesels, some in bikinis, and all eyes hidden behind enormous, smoke-colored shades-- pivot and sway while the last molecules of MDMA sweat their way out of their systems. On a stage facing the pool, a skinny young man with a blond mane swigs champagne from the bottle while he nudges absently at a computer mouse; his own massive eyeshield tosses off disco glints that mirror the flashes of light that go tearing up the firelines between bass and space in his music.</p><p>
    It's every Balearic cliché at once, except that this isn't Ibiza, it's Reñaca, Chile; and the laptop jockey isn't Sasha van Oakenweed but a skinny Finn named Luomo, née Sasu Ripatti, best known until not long before as Vladislav Delay-- a former free-jazz drummer who made the leap to Chain Reaction-styled ""heroin house"" before being crowned prince of clicks + cuts. The event is notable for several reasons, among them the globalization of European leisure culture; but the real significance here concerns the ongoing conversion of tight-lipped minimalism into something self-consciously sexy and sophisticated and Ecstasy-friendly. It's the preface to an ongoing evolution that is only coming to fruition in 2005, when the Sasha van Oakenweeds of the world pepper their mixes with tracks from Kompakt and Traum, and Creamfields' beachside raves feature the likes of Ellen Allien and Blackstrobe alongside Deep Dish and Carl Cox. In many ways, all this began with Luomo's 2000 debut, <i>Vocalcity, reissued this month on Ripatti's own Huume label.</i></p><p>
<em>Vocalcity</em> was unexpected, and not a little audacious: ""Luomo-- The Next Episode in House-- prod. by Vladislav Delay,"" proclaimed a sticker on the sleeve. The album was published by Force Tracks, one of an avalanche of sublabels from Frankfurt's Force Inc., an erstwhile ""proper"" techno imprint that had gone all theoretical as it aged, christening sublabels after Deleuze and Guattari tomes and fashioning grand philosophies around concepts like ""clicks + cuts."" (Full disclosure: I wrote the liner notes for <i>Clicks + Cuts 2.) ""The Next Episode in House"" sounded like the kind of sweeping, appropriationist, Zeitgeist-stroking statement that Force would make-- but damned if it weren't true. If anything, it sounds even truer today. It's not that Luomo advanced the cause of house music in some way that his forebears (Chez Damier, Derrick May, and Maurizio, to pick three) didn't manage to. But there was nothing else that sounded like </i><i>Vocalcity at the time, and there's been precious little that sounds like it since, including Luomo's slightly disappointing, ill-fated 2003 followup <em>The Present Lover</em></i>.</p><p>
    Writing in <em>The Wire back in 2001, I pegged <i>Vocalcity</i></em> as the tipping point (the clipping point?) in what I called microhouse-- a genre that seemed to take the essential template of house music and shrink its constituent parts (that shoomping beat, a cavernous sense of space, and an echo of soul music as processed through disco) down to byte-sized pieces, leaving a schematic of dotted lines swimming through oceans of dubwise absence. But listening now, it's clear that I got it exactly backwards, at least in Luomo's case. What stands out now, a half-decade later, isn't the smallness of <em>Vocalcity</em>'s sounds but its fullness. Sure, Luomo has the requisite clicks and clanks; as ""Market"", the absolutely epic lead track, opens up, half the action is in the chattering of truncated hi-hats and a distant rattle that sounds like an army of mechanics spinning their ratchets. But house music has always had these kind of details; for comparison, just listen to E-Dancer (Kevin Saunderson)'s 1997 cut ""World of Deep"", the track I've come to believe most closely heralds what Luomo would later attempt. Beneath those enormous, cascading pads, the hi-hats and bells have been whittled down to needlepoint proportions. Luomo emphasized his details by framing them in white space, but what you hear now, after the demise of clicks + cuts, aren't the pinpricks but the enormous, inflated sounds of everything else-- bass, pads, and of course those vocals.</p><p>
    True to its name, <em>Vocalcity</em> put breathy, yearning male and female vocals at the center of its pneumatic mix. Tracks like ""Market"", ""Class"", ""Synkro"", and ""Tessio""-- a full two-thirds of the six-track, triple LP-- expand like inner tubes as those voices come rushing in. Indeed, my favorite element of the album has always been the way that ""Market"" begins by teasing in the vocalist's breaths and sighs, one tiny gasp at a time, along with fragments of sung melody buried deep, deep, deep in the mix. Only at 4:48, nearly halfway through the 12-minute track, does she finally introduce the full vocal hook. And when the sad reprimand drops-- ""There's nothing in the world that you can do,"" repeated a full five times, then a quick breath, and finally the explosive charge buried in the slug, ""For me""-- Well, we could talk about formalism all day, but people, that right there is one of the most perfect moments in the world of pop music, albeit a full minute and 18 seconds after most pop songs have punched out the clock and gone home to sleep.</p><p>
<em>That's the triumph of <i>Vocalcity</i>. Not reduction, but expansion. Vladislav Delay has always aimed for the long view. (If you think Luomo's tracks are long-- ""She-Center"", at 10 minutes, is the shortest thing on </em><em>Vocalcity, and the rest average around 12 minutes apiece-- check out Vladislav Delay's 2000 album <i>Entain</i>, where the cuts run from 15 to 22 minutes long. 2001's <i>Anima</i></em> went even further, comprising a single, hourlong track that swirls in place like a dead tide.) If there's anything ""micro"" in <em>Vocalcity, it's the way tiny little holes open up within the frizzing chords, as though you could see the pixels framing each fraying waveform. But that's all academic. Five years later, ""minimal"" techno has fattened itself up again. Most of today's rave hits don't sound anything like Luomo, but I don't think anything today would sound the way it does if Luomo hadn't seduced the tinkerers away from their mouse pads and back to the land of goosebumps and sex. What you hear most in Luomo today are the stomach-punching bass lines, the pistoning chords inherited straight from Chicago's finest, and those maddeningly ambiguous vocals, always hovering just out of reach. Perhaps the long exception is the male refrain in ""Synkro"", which could stand as the tautological epigraph to the album's simple brilliance: ""Because you move/ The way you move.""</em></p></div>"|4929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4929-vocalcity/|9.7|Philip Sherburne

Unfortunately, <em>Capture/Release</em> might be the victim of bad timing: It's going to sound pretty rote to American audiences who've been steeped in this stuff for the past couple years, and while it's doubtful that the Rakes are overtly ripping off any of the bands they resemble, it scans as a failure of imagination on the listener's end.</p><p>
    Art Brut's mundane, declarative statements are funny as hell, balanced perfectly on the sincerity/irony axis, and Skinner's are richly detailed. The Rakes aren't as witty as Art Brut, and they lack Skinner's close scrutiny, but their lyrical slant-- revolving around the working trendy person's guilt and ennui-- is not without interest. ""Retreat"" sets the tone for the album by swinging wildly between earnestness and apathy. ""Everything is temporary these days,"" Alan Donohoe laments. But in a record that's all about jaded acquiesce, he immediately gives up: ""Might as well go out for the third night in a row."" After wondering whether he should donate his money to a charity or go on holiday, Donohoe succumbs to malaise: ""Walk home, come down, retreat to sleep/ Wake up, go out again, repeat."" The working man's blues even creep into the paranoid ""Terror!"": ""And my job in the city won't matter no more/ When the network is down and my flesh is all torn."" While a portrait of a generation's concerns, however superficial, does emerge, the triteness of these concerns and the clichés Donohoe often uses to limn them fall short of endearing. ""I had just woke up in someone else's bed/ She was overweight/ Who did I do last night?"" he charmingly wonders on ""The Guilt"".</p><p>
    But if you find the lyrics resonant (maybe it helps to be a young working Brit with a ""22 Grand Job"") and you aren't sick of jittery eight-notes yet, <em>Capture/Release</em> is a well-mounted entry. ""Strasbourg"" introduces a searing two-tone lead, a fluid rhythmic drive, and Donohoe's winning sneer in perfect pop succession, while ""Retreat"" fulfills the off-kilter Talking Heads impulse with chomping guitars and muted harmonics. ""Open Book"" is a staccato shuffle with verse-busting ""oh-ohs"" and a suavely sexy vocal line; ""Binary Love"" gleams with squiggly guitars and hooky, romantic verses; the slight reverb and sparse, hollow percussion of ""Violet"" fit in the mandatory ""sorta reggae"" slot just fine. But by the time ""Work Work Work (Pub, Club, Sleep)"" rolls around, the message-- crass materialism breed existential angst-- starts to weigh down the medium, and one longs for a lighter touch. </p></div>"|11820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11820-capturerelease/|6.3|Brian Howe

Like most
    folks watching <em>The Life Aquatic</em>, I was captivated and puzzled by his
    graceful, acoustic, Portuguese-language renditions of David Bowie covers such as ""Starman"" and ""Five Years"". Jorge also appeared in <em>City of God, although that didn't have much to do with music unless there is some arcane
    connection between his role as Knockout and Diplo's Baile funk
    culture-mongering. Jorge himself was raised in the favelas so desperately portrayed in Fernando Meirelles' film, but there isn't any booty bass in
    his bossa nova.</em></p><p>
    On <em>CRU, Jorge's voice and pristine guitar work
    make the tangentials of his success postscript. This is not to say his
    second solo album is perfect. In fact, it has holes near the end and at
    times lacks a backbone. But his samba is precise and frisky, especially on
    ""Bem Querer"" where his a- once harsh and flitting voice dances. The spare,
    booming percussion doesn't just suggest hip-hop-- it is hip-hop. Jorge has
    his voice-- at once buttery, soulful, and fierce-- mixed up front on every track, like a rapper. Album closer ""Eu sou Favela""
    (translation: ""I Am the Favela"") is akin to Young Jeezy's recent declaration
    ""I am the Trap"". Territorial-identification and submersion is a distinctly
    prideful act, one not lost on someone who has witnessed murder. This is not
    to say he spits bars. But he's doing something like it throughout.</em></p><p>
    Jorge's cover of Serge Gainsbourg's ""Chatterton"" is music nerd fodder, but the song-- wrapped in a deep, ominous synth and rapid strumming-- is
    no French layabout. On it he gnarls his voice into a wretched growl and
    transmogrifies Gainsbourg's historical name-check into a funky séance, fit
    with shrilling witch moans at its languid conclusion. A press release
    compares Jorge's style to Nick Drake; that assessment isn't far off either.
    The accompaniment on many of the songs here is ethereal. Muted maracas
    shake, didgeridoos blow, and bird calls squawk. Only one song here is sung in
    English, a quietly rapturous cover of Elvis Presley's ""Don't"". It's a
    gorgeous reclamation project and prime girlfriend-mixtape material. Unless
    she understands Portuguese, in which case, the album's best song, the
    mellifluous opener ""Tive Razão"", should open anything with 2005 on the spine.</p><p>
    As a Favela-saluting everyman, Jorge mostly avoids America-seducing, though.
    That's why not being able to understand the words on <em>CRU</em> is both maddening
    and rewarding. You've got your World Music badge of honor. Now go find your
    Babelfish hyperlink.</p></div>"|4361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4361-cru/|7.4|Sean Fennessey

The 20 tracks on her new retrospective <em>Heartaches &amp; Highways all adhere to a similar metronomic setting, somewhere between a country ballad and a church hymn-- steady, patient, and reserved, not really slow but certainly not fast. ""I don't have that many up-tempo songs,"" she confesses to Robert K. Oermann in the liner notes. In a sense this plays to her strengths and allows her to draw out every note so that her ragged, dignified voice can wring as much pain from the syllables as possible. Kicking off </em><em>Heartaches &amp; Highways, ""Love Hurts"", her duet with Gram Parsons, bursts with exquisite heartbreak, so tended and curated that it sounds museum-worthy. Following that song is ""Boulder to Birmingham"", which Harris wrote for Parsons following his death in 1973. Those two songs are about as perfectly sad and weepy as you could ever hope for, and the circumstances of their recording give them an extra punch, although ""Boulder to Birmingham"" seems to be missing something essential, and after a few listens you realize it's Parsons' voice.</em></p><p>
    
    The 18 songs that follow never quite reach these musical heights or emotional depths, but do we really expect them to? In the ensuing 30 years, Harris has gone out and come back into fashion, her jet-black hair has turned alluringly silver, and she has recorded more than 20 mostly solid albums and countless collaborations, most of which are chronicled on <em>Heartaches &amp; Highways. Her voice blends mesmerically with Roy Orbison's gentle warble on ""That Lovin' You Feelin' Again"", and Harris re-creates 1960s girl-group harmonies with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt on their gentle cover of Phil Spector's ""To Know Him Is to Love Him"". Her collaboration with producer Daniel Lanois on 1995's </em><em>Wrecking Ball--  represented here by the Gillian Welch cover ""Orphan Girl""--  reinvigorated her career with its darker, less traditional sounds, but it also set the tone for every album since, which all seem to prize atmosphere as much as songs.</em></p><p>
    
    Over three-and-a-half decades, Harris has exhibited an exceptional taste in covers. Those included on <i>Heartaches &amp; Highways are deep-catalog picks from established artists, avoiding obvious choices or previous hits. Harris recorded Townes Van Zandt's ""Pancho &amp; Lefty"" before it was a hit for Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson and gives their more popular version a serious run for its money. In addition to providing impeccable material, these covers often allow her to step outside of her midtempo comfort zone: she retains the skipping rhythms of the Louvin Brothers' ""If I Could Only Win Your Love"" and even quickens her pace for Delbert McClinton's ""Two More Bottles of Wine"".</i></p><p>
    
    Harris's gift for inspired covers culminates with the collection's only new track, a version of Randy Sharp's ""The Connection"" that teams Harris with original producer Brian Ahern and early collaborator Fayssoux Starling. It's yet another midtempo song, a downbeat number that might sound better on an album that wasn't entirely comprised of downbeat numbers. And that's the crucial flaw in <em>Heartaches &amp; Highways: It implies that Harris's talents were limited to a certain breed of song, and while these twenty tracks all prove dynamic showcases for her singular voice, they barely hint at her considerable range of abilities and interests.</em></p></div>"|4019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4019-heartaches-highways-the-very-best-of-emmylou-harris/|7.2|Stephen M.

He's made the most of these 30-odd (sometimes extremely odd) intervening months: In addition to maintaining his near-continuous schedule of solo touring and recording, he's made cameo appearances with acts ranging from Vetiver to Antony and the Johnsons, and has unreluctantly emerged as the de facto ambassador for the freak-folk nation.</p>
<p>In this latter role, he has been a valued and tireless champion of all things acoustic and enchanted. 2004's Banhart-curated Arthur magazine compilation Golden Apples of the Sun remains one of the scene's most defining documents, plus he deserves at least partial credit for helping to coax 60s folk legend Vashti Bunyan out of retirement, and later this year he'll help launch a new label, Gnomensong.</p>
<p>Gnomensong's first release is to be Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom, the first full-length solo collection from Texas-based singer-songwriter Jana Hunter, formerly of Matty &amp; Mossy, whose ""Farm, CA"" was one of Golden Apples's dusky highlights. And now Banhart has provided Hunter's career yet another boost with the release of this vinyl-only split LP. The album contains five songs from Devendra and five from Hunter, none of which, according to Troubleman Unlimited, are ever to be issued on CD. So while Banhart completists had best step lively, this weird little record sparkles with enough tiny moments of peculiar, glowing beauty that it should carry honest appeal for the rest of us as well.</p>
<p>For his part, Banhart's contributions here should be considered as more of a sidebar to 2004's <i>Nino Rojo</i> than as a teaser for his forthcoming <i>Cripple Crow</i>. Of his five songs, three are alternate versions of Rojo tracks, and one is a live, intensely hippified full-band medley of Oh Me Oh My's ""Little Monkey"" and R. Kelly's ""Step In the Name of Love"", a match that unfortunately sounds nowhere near as strange as it looks on paper. Throughout these songs, Banhart displays a deft touch as both a singer and guitarist, treating the tracks as living, breathing entities as he fluidly bends notes and syllables in subtle new directions. And though the redundancy of many of these tracks may keep them from seeming truly essential, the lively, infectious joy of his performances ensures that none ever qualifies as a pure throwaway.</p>
<p>Much more revelatory is Hunter's side of the coin. Despite what titles like ""That Dragon Is My Husband"" might lead you to believe, her approach lacks much of the old-timey naturalism of such contemporaries as Joanna Newsom or Marissa Nadler. Instead Hunter utilizes a distinctly homegrown, lo-fi production style filled with grainy overdubbed vocals, guitar and handclaps that gives her songs a deceptively rich depth of field. ""True love is writ with a stick in the pavement,"" she sings on ""Black Haven"", a song that, as with her others here, owes as much to K Records' handknit, DIY aesthetic as to any cross-generational folk traditions. With none of these tracks extending much beyond two minutes in length, Hunter's portion of this album provides just the briefest tantalizing glimpses of her talents, her songs brimming with the same sort of unique promise one might've detected on Banhart's own early demos just a few short years ago.</p></div>"|11659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11659-devendra-banhart-jana-hunter/|7.0|Matthew Murphy

There is a metallic taste to the air, and the sun, even at high noon, obscured by layers of sooty gas and overstuffed rain clouds. Black Dice, even when trying to inject a little rhythmic propulsion into their mechanic-industrial commotion, come off brittle and oil-stained futuristic. To a degree, this is dirty music, though more in style than execution; competing pulses from synthesizers, drum machines and the odd, antiquated guitar (via loop or sample, of course) destroy what little firm ground on which there is to step, but the landscape described by the sound is sturdy, if in need of polish. In fact, it's hard to say whether or not the quasi-urbanized clang is actually futuristic, as when drums appear, they're decidedly ""tribal"". Nevertheless, it's an isolated wilderness put forth on <i>Broken Ear Record</i>: away from city noise, refinement and fellow travelers.</p>
<p>Brooklyn trio Black Dice are the most interesting ""noise"" band I know. Never content to inhabit one sonic guise for long, their track record for navigating unexplored areas of static, delay, distortion and bizarre, heavenly bits of electronic data is almost unparalleled among would-be contemporaries. They've landed on the spikiest stylistic beachheads in modernist rock, from splatter noise-core, electronic ambience, quasi-electro acoustic improv (EAI), death disco and now to what I would clumsily characterize as post-apocalyptic jungle-core-- and isn't that a mouthful? Consequently, as easy as it is to marvel at their ambition, it's sometimes tough to really settle into one of their records. There's always something a little uncomfortable about Black Dice-- but then they wouldn't be as interesting otherwise. <i>Broken Ear Record</i>, reportedly the result of the band needing more rhythmic material to play live, is no exception: It's flighty, frustrating, and at times a little frigid, but intelligent and never lacking in momentum.</p>
<p>The sounds used should seem familiar to fans of 2004's polarizing <i>Creature Comforts</i>, as many of its synth patches, guitar tones and delay effects are featured on <i>Broken Ear Record</i>. The muffled, horn-like call that opens ""Snarly Yow"" could easily have been found hidden inside one of <i>Comforts</i>' robotic tone poems, as could the scraped percussion or the bizarre vocal loop that adorns its outer edges. However, here, rather than revel in the chaos of a savage urban jungle, Black Dice quantize the beats and sprinkle kick drums strategically throughout the track. There are moments that pound, but most of the time, the piece is content to merely suggest pulse, using loops and even modest stretches with straightforward melody. Make no mistake, melody doesn't play quite the importance in this world it does even in, say, Boredoms/Vooredoms' music (BD's most obvious predecessors)-- but as with Broken Ear's efficient use of 4/4 drum stomp, a little goes a long way.</p>
<p>""Motorcycle"" uses the elements of melody and industrial rhythm to best advantage, at times sounding like a clamorous update on the Indestructible Beat of Soweto. High pitched human barks bounce up from a chorus of thud-drums, and a buoyant guitar line I swear was lifted from Graceland carries the tune into regions previously too naked-faced ""accessible"" for Black Dice. Yes, there are machine gun hits at the end, and no, the relative upfrontness of the melodies never lulls me into thinking I'm listening to pop music, but I'm hooked nonetheless. Likewise, the single ""Smiling Off"" features vocal harmonies (!) and another thudding percussion cadence (more rollicking than primal this time), though withholding the payoff for several minutes while bass drone, static and an erratic siren battle for dominance, flailing blindly in a dark room. ""Street Dude"" allows this kind of battle to reign supreme, as stereophonic synth blare and a drowning chirp overwhelm the short-lived click-track beat.</p>
<p>There are no truly ""calm"" songs on <i>Broken Ear Record</i>, but there are occasions to catch your breath. ""Heavy Manners"" uses a looped, queasy guitar figure with muffled vocals similarly to Animal Collective in one of their acid-damaged moments. Even ""ABA"", at less than a minute, allows me to shake away the haze via anti-gravity synth dips and pops. Still, Black Dice have hardly compromised what sounds like a pure vision. Their insistence on change is the mark of a still vibrantly creative band, and while I could do with even more rhythmic focus, I can't argue their total dedication to <i>Broken Ear</i>'s aesthetic. Jagged and ornery, but playful: this is music for treading dangerously.</p></div>"|752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/752-broken-ear-record/|8.1|Dominique Leone

Place me in an immersion tank and surround my ass with some doom metal. Who wants to float in simulated space conditions when they can choose to hide from the sun and get suffocated by their own sense of abandonment?</p><p>
    
    YOB aren't an escape. They're metaphysical doom. Sure, you should be scared of evil. It can tailor-make your destruction in a heartbeat. But struggling with your faith, mind, and reason for being placed on this Earth are slower and much more frightening. Which isn't to say they're waiting around for your muscles to atrophy between snare hits (Khanate) or the bass drone to give your bowels a break (Boris). You could do the reference game with them all day, name checking Sleep, Burning Witch, Neurosis, and High on Fire-- even Electric Wizard, Ufomammut, Isis, Melvins, and Black Sabbath wouldn't be out of line. But YOB's <i>The Unreal Never Lived-- four songs-in-50 minutes-- still stands out on its own as epic downtrodden metal with what sounds like seasoned potsmokers throwing in their <em>High Times</em> for some new age religious tracts.</i></p><p>
    
    Four songs of peristaltic chug would be nothing without at least a few vocals. Vocalist Mike Scheidt has the diversity to growl, bellow, whisper, yell, and hit some high notes like few other metal singers. Be warned, the high notes can get a little nutless in the Dio or Geddy Lee vain, but they probably only last for around a combined 30 seconds. And that's the only goofy thing about YOB...Oh wait, I just read the lyrics. ""Quantum Mystic"" with its ""His message to this world still resounds for all time/ The Unreal Never Lived and the real does not ever die beyond all birth and death/ The real is timeless/ Open the shutter of the mind and it will be flooded with light"" is probably about the Indian Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj who answered most of the questions of life with vague ""I am"" answers. ""Kosmos"" even tells me, ""Peace lives in the space where no one is there."" But remember my teachings, my music reviewing students, ""Metal is what it is, when it is what it always was.""</p><p>
    
    Even with some goofy lyrics, YOB sound like doom, the kind that has you up at night wondering why we even bother holding jobs when we barely get paid enough to pay for our housing and vehicles or why we bother befriending people if they are just gonna turn on us. And those methodical bastards in YOB probably enjoy causing that pain.</p></div>"|8917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8917-the-unreal-never-lived/|8.0|Austin Gaines

    on the fringes, and Britpop was no exception. In an era of tabloid spectacle
    and the often wanton pursuit of superstardom, the Auteurs were something
    unique: Their music had the melodic grace of the best Britpop, but was far
    less ostentatious, and their leader, Luke Haines, filled his songs with
    caustic sarcasm and brutality.
    In spite of a Mercury Prize nomination for their debut album, 1993's <em>New
    Wave, the Auteurs always remained something of a cult act, their critical acclaim outpacing their sales. Haines
    sort of perversely embraced his outsider role, naming his Baader Meinhof
    side project for a 1980s European terrorist organization and elevating scorn
    for the record business literally to an art form with his </em><em>Songwriting Genius
    of Luke Haines &amp; the Auteurs</em> album, in which he recast some of his most
    popular songs as almost unlistenably syrupy orchestral easy-listening tunes to fulfill a contractual obligation for a greatest hits
    compilation.</p><p>
    
    Since the dissolution of the Auteurs, Haines has had greater success with his
    Black Box Recorder project, which includes John Moore and Sarah Nixey, but this new
    three-disc set doesn't go there, instead focusing on material developed with
    the Auteurs, Baader Meinhof, and under his own name. There is more than three hours of music here, and it goes almost without saying that
    anyone who's not already a devoted fan of the man has no business starting
    with this disc. There's a huge wealth of great tracks among these 63
    cuts, as well as a lot of variety-- the material ranges from sweeping, heavily orchestrated pop to despondent
    ballads about class war to electro-tinged funk-pop and scorching rock-- but I'd recommend newcomers begin where Haines himself began, with <em>New Wave.</em></p><p>
    
    Devotees will find plenty of value here in the unreleased cuts, B-sides, and
    BBC sessions, though it's unfortunate that amongst the few (pretty lame)
    remixes that pop up that nothing from the <em>Auteurs vs. Mu-ziq</em> is included.
    Mu-ziq made no secret of his disdain for the material he was remixing, and
    it made for some interesting work (Haines takes a humorous shot at it and
    Mu-ziq himself in the liners, in which he also rates most of his own albums
    five stars out of five). Most album cuts are presented in some sort of
    alternate form, be it an alternate mix or a slightly different single
    version, though no one who would actually buy this is going to be completely
    taken by surprise. Working it down to two discs by excising the tracks fans
    already know by heart might have been advisable, but I'm sure
    Haines had his own internally logical reasons for going with a three-disc
    set.</p><p>
    
    Judging by the nine BBC session recordings here, I'd say it might be worth
    releasing an entire album of just those, as almost every one trumps the
    original studio version-- particularly the live recording
    of <em>Now I'm a Cowboy</em>'s ""New French Girlfriend"". The sessions brush up comfortably alongside nearly a whole album's
    worth of previously unreleased songs (a few marked ""unreleased"" are just
    slightly different versions of old album tracks, for instance a sped-up,
    less T. Rex-ish ""Bailed Out""). A few are throwaways, like ""Couple Dancing""--
    little more than a couple minutes of a string section warming up-- but others
    such as the funky clavinet crawl of ""ESP Kids"" and the throbbing disco of ""Essex Boot Boys"" definitely deserved a public
    airing.</p><p>
    
    If anything held back Haines' vision during the 90s, it was probably
    his own very limited singing voice, which very often constricts to a
    gravelly whisper. Having Sarah Nixey around to handle the vocals is probably
    the principle reason Black Box Recorder managed a bigger foothold
    in the popular consciousness. Indeed, over three full hours of listening to
    his voice can get a little old, but I don't get the impression that this is
    meant to be listened to in one go like that anyway. If anything, it's a gift
    for all the people who stuck with him even through the most frustratingly
    obtuse phases of his career, and even during passages where it feels like
    something of a mish-mash, it's a rewarding look at an undeniably great
    songwriter.</p></div>"|4020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4020-luke-haines-is-dead/|7.7|Joe Tangari

Trademark Elbow is the languorous, brooding sort typified in 2001's <i>Asleep in the Back and 2004's </i><i>Cast of Thousands, but the band's third LP, <em>Leaders of the Free World</em>, leaves dankly gorgeous torpor mostly behind. </i></p><p>
    
    George W. Bush is at least partially to blame, if only for the title track, which references him near-explicitly: ""Passing the gun from father to feckless son/ We're climbing a landslide where only the good die young."" The song's primary gripe is fair enough: ""The leaders of the free world/ Are just little boys throwing stones/ And its easy to ignore 'til they're knocking on the door of your homes."" The idea that America's president is ""spoilt, nasty, selfish little shit for brains"" (says Garvey to the BBC) is nothing new, but Elbow's take is problematic: World affairs are easiest to tune out when said affairs don't directly concern themselves; by confessing so, Elbow inadvertently declare accusatory kinship to ""little boys throwing stones.""</p><p>
    
    The rest of the album flounders apolitically, as well. It's dull, for one thing. Why, pray tell, did Elbow decide to start sounding less like Radiohead rip-offs and more like midlife-crisis Travis? <em>Leaders still intimates ""Creep"" in places, but it also garners new Brit bloke alignments: Past comparisons to Coldplay were probably undeserved, but present ones make sense. These guys are flirting with the seductively pointy fingernails of adult contemporary's harmless-but-gooey clutches.</em></p><p>
    
    Gone is the charming fog of Elbow-rock, replaced by cheery caveats against partying too hard (""Picky Bugger""). Brevity has never been their strong suit, but this is Elbow at their dullest shoe-cum-navel gazing. Complaints that tempos never changed on previous albums were valid circa <em>Asleep in the Back, but irrelevant now: Speeding up hardly helps captivate. If the plan was to bait with catchier hooks, and exhume sentiment with slower, choir-backed ones, it flops ponderously. Fast song/slow song switch-offs seem contrived and go to show: Elbow do best when going with their (preferably gloomy) gut.</em></p></div>"|2720.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2720-leaders-of-the-free-world/|6.2|Rachel Khong

    difficult to complain about the gaudiness.
    Thus far, <em>Before the Dawn Heals Us</em> has served as the defining
    exhalation of his emo Tangerine Dream climaxes-- it was his first solo
    dispatch sans co-conspirator Nicolas Fromageau, who lent a gentler,
    less urban touch to the modest, midday beauty of 2003's <em>Dead Cities,
    Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</em>. Now M83's
    time line curves back to its skeletal 2001 self-titled
    album, newly reissued by Mute.</p><p>
    
    If anything, <em>M83</em> is a good spot to give pause to later <em>Loveless</em>
    comparisons. Cynics term Gonzalez's shoegaze one-dimensional, but
    he's focused on stars and hearts, not his laces. The disembodied
    guitars of his later period do evoke Kevin Shields; M83's dream
    pop, though, is more redolent of mid-period MBV, especially <em>Isn't
    Anything</em>'s ""Soft As Snow (But Warm Inside)"" minus the vocals, and here this sweaty-palm
    sensibility is clearest.</p><p>
    
    Rich in static, gauzy meteor showers and analog synth, the
    earthier palette may appeal to those who thought <em>Before the
    Dawn</em> too gigantic. Yet the sap's still here. In fact, when read in order and punctuated
    accordingly, <em>M83's</em> 14 track titles narrate the briefest
    boy-girl interaction: ""Last Saturday night at the party, Kelly,
    sitting facing that violet tree, staring at me. I'm getting closer.
    She stands up, caresses slowly my face. 'I'm happy,' she said."" Once
    this simple code's cracked, the music works as soundtrack to the buried tableau. Contributing to their cinematic frame, Gonzalez and Fromageau use a fair share of movie dialogue, and other speakers take turns imparting ghostly (or robotic)
    lines between drum machines and Sirkian swells.</p><p>
    
    Parts of <i>M83 fail to make an impression. A few snippety pieces are merely ear-candy transition, but fleshier works-- the swooning ""Night"" and
    upbeat ""Slowly""-- dote on dreamy glitch-pop. Odd as it may seem,
    ""Sitting""-- complete with dorky ""let's go"" sample-- is reminiscent
    of the Faint doing an instrumental AM radio version of ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", and it's here I began
    missing the band's eventual focus on upfront live drums.</i></p><p>
    
    Album closer ""I'm Happy, She Said"" points clearest to M83's future, opening on organ and glockenspiel before sputtering into Northern Lights percussion. Virtual hi-hat kicks one channel, a sputtering
    low-end jams the other. Enter minor chords, rising/falling cloudburst,
    extended pauses, minute emotional accretion. It sounds like how it feels to live inside a triumphal music box. Then there's a long
    pause, and a bonus bit. Then another. Ad infinitum.</p><p>
    
    Needy contextualization aside, <em>M83</em> provides a modest backward
    glance, a chance to see where certain seeds were planted, but pretty as
    it is at times, I keep wishing it would jolt from basic black-and-white to unwieldy technicolor.</p></div>"|5012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5012-m83/|6.5|Brandon Stosuy

The better story is rock's 50-year failure to make plain its furious soundmaker, the electric guitar. Sound is vibration, pure tone is farce, distortion is social, inevitable. No surprise, my faves who've struggled with that pop vs. noise, structure vs. unstructure windigo-- Branca, Hendrix, Velvets, Can, Sonic Youth, JAMC, MBV, Fennesz-- count for some of modern music's all-time greatest failures. Here's another one.</p><p> Norway's Serena Maneesh take the main stage at Oslo's Øya Music Festival dressed like gypsies. Band leader Emil Nikolaisen has a wispy moustache, Chick Corea-style, Jimi-worshipping. His half-sister on bass could ring for Nico, a cold, daunting figure from afar, no stage movements, noble and grand, somewhat melancholic. The other members I can't see. ""What a fucking mission this band's on,"" I think. ""What a terrible fucking band.""</p><p> They tinker on stage with a hint of motorik for 20 minutes, then a stomp of it, no sign of stopping; people have no stomach for this diskaholic bullshit, and tuck out for chicken and beer and, I think, Roots Manuva. No cue, no looks, Nico snaps a bassline from the stew of guitar noise and disembodied voices, and suddenly Serena Maneesh are bars into the festival's first and only mindfuck-- the one I went several thousand miles hoping I might experience. Tucked deep within ""Sapphire Eyes High"" is the only melody that matters this fall, its chorus unintelligible because Nico's voice dissipates upon exit-- so too do the stringy jangle and generously amped kick. The breathy line goes for but 30 seconds, entirely too short, then dissolves back into the abstractions that birthed it. So much noise it takes to balance out so beautiful a moment.</p><p> They get it, Serena Maneesh, their demeanor electric and alternating, built off antagonistic relationships. The band, like the instrument, are apt to prove noise and un-noise are of one cut. To that end, these aren't 11 songs so much as 12 blood-riling arguments. ""Un-Deux"" jumps forth and back from sunshine pop to pork-pulled guitar noise, a clean but 30-mile-wide gap between the two, more impassible with each repetition. Two minutes, they give up. ""Don't Come Down Here"" takes a ho-hum strum and hopes that the one fissure in the progression-- a sloppy passing chord that butts with what's before and after it-- will, with enough repetitions, spiderweb and eat away the pleasantness. Nope. ""Chorale Lick"" and ""Candlelighted"" meander half their lengths, soft-focus guitars and brute syncopated grooves with nonsense floating in and about, shrouding melodies too shimmering for bare sight.</p><p> The album as a whole fights the twelfth, track sequence playing up each song's coaster-like turmoil. A subtle move, but it bleaches the whites, deepens the blacks-- rare chiaroscuro for rock's faint of art. Listen, those fuzzy guitar octaves that start the record could have led us anywhere-- so for-fun, so worry-free-- but instead we follow them into themselves, until this full-length debut implodes with 10 minutes of dizzying, even skronky frustration, then a shriek off the footbridge. Why are the stakes so high? Better question is, why not?</p></div>"|8972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8972-serena-maneesh/|8.6|Nick Sylvester

The found audio that opens the disc seems to confirm this suspicion, folding every offensive gay stereotype into one lisping soliloquy. This is unfortunate, since, unless Asian Man is wise enough to release the album with a sticker reading ""featuring Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart,"" a large portion of its target audience might miss out. XITSJ's existence (around the turn of the millennium) was brief, but they managed to record enough material for this 22-track précis. <em>Accordion Solo!</em> collects the bulk of XITSJ's debut LP, <em>My Very Private Map</em>, the follow-up EP <em>Inside the Computer Are All of My Feelings</em>, the unreleased <em>Eat Death Orphans!</em>, and a handful of live tracks.</p><p>
    In short, this is a must-have for Xiu Xiu fans-- while it's naturally less developed, it contains plenty of winning experimentation and choleric melody; more importantly, it's a digest, albeit a slightly inchoate one, of the techniques Stewart is perfecting with Xiu Xiu: Here's a portrait of the mannered provocateur as questing manqué. Xiu Xiu's silvery guitars and murmur-to-caterwaul vocals are predicted on ""Hot Karl""; the regal synth line on ""San Jose Fight Song"" sound like late-Dismemberment Plan but foreshadows the digital sculptures of recent Xiu Xiu; and <em>La Foret</em>'s clattery dirges can easily be traced back to XITSJ tracks like ""Gauntlet of Thor the Destroyer"" and ""When You Write"".</p><p>
    But the biggest hook for collectors will be the early versions of Xiu Xiu tracks: ""I Love the Valley"", which became a fan favorite when it appeared on <em>Fabulous Muscles</em> as ""I Luv the Valley OH!"", appears in studio and live versions. This starker rendering keeps the guitar line and the lyrics, but finds Stewart's voice clambering between emphatic and tremulous passages, and replaces the vigorous lead melody with loopy, sliding synths. Happily, it includes the terse scream that pinions the middle, and drops in a jackbooted synth line that strikes with goosebumpy force. There's also an almost industrial version of <em>A Promise</em>'s ""Sad Pony Guerilla Girl"" (here called ""Sad Girl"") and a wistful take on <em>Fag Patrol</em>'s ""Helsabot"". </p><p>
    Usually, this is where the disclaimer goes-- ""only recommended to diehard fans."" But <em>Accordion Solo!</em> is the rare early-career document that works as a stand-alone record. One gets the sense that Stewart had yet to develop the confidence to be as melodramatic as he'd like (he even sings in a quite unaffected, lovely voice on several tracks), and Xiu Xiu detractors might find this preferable to the more realized recent work, while for neophytes, it will provide a valuable foothold on Stewart's daunting, alien terrain.  </p></div>"|8301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8301-accordion-solo/|7.4|Brian Howe

Tamir Muskat by J.U.F. out of the promo box. (Or was it <i>J.U.F.</i></i> by Gogol Bordello Vs. Tamir Muskat? These pomo remixing shenanigans are hell on attribution.) I was vaguely familiar with Gogol Boredello-- a kind of fire-spitting punk cabaret troupe with traditional gypsy elements (or so I thought) outta NYC-- but this was something else entirely.</p>
<p>There were beats, for starters-- dancehall, hip-hop, jigs and reels, thumping drum machines-- and samples (or was it all being played live?) of guitars, horns, and accordions. The vocals were declaimed in a style somewhere between uppity Balkan cabbie and ragga toaster, heavy on the nasal. The lyrics were about Spanish car service drivers and ""supernatural and infantile"" little spies. In other words, it sounded pretty much like my Sunday morning walk to get the paper when I lived in Queens.</p>
<p>I later found out Gogol Bordello frontman Eugene Hutz DJs regularly in NYC, and his playlists sound like a dream: Dancehall, klezmer, rai, jungle, old Polish jazz-- all played at warp speed for a stupid-drunk audience of revelers to spit beer on each other and hump legs. The J.U.F. record was itself a mash-up of Gogol's live band punk gymboree and the ""play the best bits"" genrefuck of Hutz' DJ sets.</p>
<p>So I was a little apprehensive about hearing the real Gogol for the first time. Given my personal biases-- DJ culture over live band, etc.-- how could it live up to such a perfectly formed little nubbin of modern eclecticism kulture? Especially when it was-- gasp!-- produced by Steve Albini! You can't mike a drum machine for maximum live-room sound.</p>
<p>But, you know, it's great. The first thing I thought was ""the Ex"" and the second thing I thought was ""this is pretty fucking unique, really."" Like the Ex, they trade in ""world rhythms"" occasionally but don't make a big deal out of it. And there's a bit of the same guitar tone and scrabbling, scratching playing style (on violin as well) in there too. But whereas the vocals in the Ex can be passionate but kind of stilted, Hutz is pure sleaze, a long tongue down your mama's ear. ""Think Globally, Fuck Locally"", a song title and a catchphrase, one so obviously ripe for mass dissemination that Hutz wears it down his shirtsleeves.</p>
<p>It also has a drum-break purportedly played on a overturned fire bucket, but I gotta admit it's a pretty well-miked fire bucket. There's also some bestially played guitar and sawed-off fiddlin', strangled cascades of notes that goes well with the loosely tethered drumming. Like a ton of the best rock, Gogol sounds like it's often on the verge of total chaos. Which is not to say they don't groove; the tension of near-collapse makes them swing even harder. ""Trouble Friends"" plays slashing guitar against a heavy one-drop reggae groove, a dubbed-out perversion of the one-drop roots sound that's all over dancehall this year. ""60 Revolutions (Per Minute)"" rescues the accordion from kitsch, mostly by speeding everything up to polka-punk tempo and throwing a little Latin rap in because they can. ""Immigrant Punk"" pairs another reggae groove against Morricone guitar and Hutz frothing about being eyeballed by small-minded townies just because he looks like he fell down at a Jo-Ann Fabrics store.</p>
<p>In many ways, the fact that they ooze the same kind of stinky, trash-soaked, Greek-pizza-joint-coffee-tastin, Canal Street-on-a-high-summer-afternoon aroma through just a band in a room is even more amazing than the cut-and-paste J.U.F. record. (If not quite as thrilling.) Gogol don't play funk, but they sure are funky. And no one, not even Greg Norton, has a better mustache in rock than Hutz.</p></div>"|3495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3495-gypsy-punks-underdog-world-strike/|7.8|Jess Harvell

For some reason, indie guys don't usually make mixtapes even though they should. When Slug from Atmosphere and Murs from Def Jux/Living Legends feel like ditching emo-rap for soft-focus dude-talk, they have to go and put out a whole album under a different name. And really, that's fine; I'm just glad they're doing this stuff at all.</p><p>
    
    Both of these guys are famous for making grand, ambitious statements about their love lives or casual racism, Heavy Issues. They aren't so much famous for being able to rap really well, but that doesn't mean they can't. Most of <em>Lisa Bonet</em> is just on some ignorant rap shit, sex jams and effortless common-sense (not Common Sense) battle-rap on top of squelchy, greasy fake G-funk from Atmosphere producer Ant. Here's Slug: ""Thug white girl, suburban black hippie chick/ Punk rock straight-edge, hip-hop pothead/ Invite em all over for a mosh pit in my bed."" And here's Murs: ""She don't have to grow up with the same type of hard-heads/ Think she a Blood cuz her boyfriend's car red."" Or more to the point, here's Murs again, delivering the closest thing the album has to a mission statement: ""It's front-yard politics/ We talk a lot of shit/ Who we wanna fight, which broads we wanna hit.""</p><p>
    
    And so it goes on; the two rip mics over rippling 70s cop-show-theme bongos on ""Early Mornin' Tony"" and beat the Young Gunz at their own game on the clicky, sidelong pimp jam ""Breaker Down Like a Shotgun"". And when they do get heavy, like on the thick, stormy confession ""Marvin Gaye"" (Slug: ""Open apology for anyone who follows me/ Didn't realize I was a self-made power-freak""), it doesn't last. A track later, they're talking fun <em>Swingers bullshit over cheesed-out 80s synths on ""Life Vegas"".</em></p><p>
    
    Other than a couple of throwaway skits where they talk condescendingly to girls on the phone, <i>Felt 2</i> is pretty great. There's a sense of relief, like they've been doing this chest-beating thing for too long and they're relieved to figure out that they still have some knucklehead in them. And so when they inevitable Anticon moment does come on the last two songs, when Slug and Murs finally plunge back into the confessional, it feels well-earned, like they can go back to this stuff secure in the knowledge that they're still great rappers. And, you know, they're really good at this emo-rap stuff, too. </p></div>"|3349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3349-a-tribute-to-lisa-bonet/|7.7|Tom Breihan

The Cincinnati-based Greenhornes have been working this particular corner of rock history since 1999, when they released their rough-and-tumble debut, <em>Gun for You</em>. Since then, amid several line-up changes that whittled the quintet down to a streamlined trio, the band has released three albums of blistering pop-rock that's better than most of the groups that stole their thunder, and they have shown their surprising range as Loretta Lynn's backing band (which she christened the Do Whaters) on her stately comeback album, <em.van lear=""Lear"" rose=""Rose"">, produced by friend-of-the-band Jack White. Even though the moment has passed them by, the Greenhornes are sticking to their guns and insisting their influences are timeless. </em.van></p><p>
    
    Their new EP, <em>East Grand Blues</em>, expands their repertoire considerably, thanks to producer and White collaborator Brendan Benson, who polishes and sophisticates the Greenhornes' sound. Whereas their previous material was blisteringly raw and rowdy, these five songs prove much cleaner and more studied, hinting at a slightly different approach and a radically different direction. Parts of the EP sound invigorated by the change and exhibit the trio's range, but this new tack has its drawbacks. <em>East Grand Blues</em> begins with its most lackluster tracks: ""I'm Going Away"" sets dreamy harmonies to a Roger McGuinn guitar theme but seems lifeless, and ""Shelter of Your Arms"" perks up only for Craig Fox's insistent ""Don't walk away!"" on the chorus. The Greenhornes sound subdued and, worse, dull, especially compared to their previous material.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, on the EP's third track, the band shows more of its cards, recapturing and fine-tuning the heady momentum and rarified nostalgia the band is known for. ""At Night"" sets a tense Kinks-y verse against a darkly psychedelic chorus that's drenched in paisley organ swirls, and yet for all Benson's pristine production, the song sounds completely off the cuff-- simple, yet spontaneous. Building on that foundation, ""Pattern Skies"" rides Craig Fox's Creation-inspired guitar riff and Jack Lawrence's percolating basslines. Wood-block percussion keeps time on the closer, ""Shine Like the Sun,"" as Fox sings one of the band's best melodies, a short series of ascending phrases that's beguiling in its straightforwardness. These songs point to a further refinement of the band's sound on albums to come, but it's hard not to think that <em>East Grand Blues</em> would come across much better in a different context-- say, three or four years ago. Despite their best efforts, the EP sound twice dated: reminiscent of a decade long past and recalling a revival that's a few years gone.</p></div>"|3684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3684-east-grand-blues-ep/|6.8|Stephen M.

Life was not complex.  Everybody was looking for openings. Some would get 'em and they'd be gone and others never did. Mine was coming, but just not yet."" </em><em>No Direction Home</em> traces Dylan's career from the summer of 1961 (when Dylan first moved to New York) through the 1966 release of <em>Blonde on Blonde</em>, and doubles as the soundtrack to the Martin Scorsese documentary of the same name, which will be aired on PBS later this month.</p><p>
    
    Unlike the previous three installments of the <em>Bootleg Series</em>, which captured complete live performances, <em>No Direction Home</em> is a collection of demos, alternate takes, and live recordings, ranging from a barely audible ""When I Got Trouble"", recorded in 1959 by one of Dylan's high school classmates (making it, in all probability, the first original song Dylan ever laid to tape, all strummy guitar and dim, somersaulting blues-vocals) to the raucous, full-band explosion of ""Like a Rolling Stone"" (the infamous ""Judas!"" version, which also appeared on the fourth volume of the <em>Bootleg Series</em>, <em>Live 1966</em>). The songs are laid out chronologically, designed to let listeners see exactly how far Bob Dylan came in six years. 2005 has seen a new glut of Dylan insight, and <em>Chronicles, </em><em>No Direction Home</em>, and <em>Live at the Gaslight 1962</em> (a companion piece to <em>No Direction Home</em>, presently available only at your local Starbucks, and sadly worth the stench of burned milk and spilled espresso) are impossibly telling when swallowed together: the end result is a comprehensive glimpse into Dylan-at-21, an oddly detailed examination of a perpetually misunderstood artist.</p><p>
    
    ""This Land Is Your Land"", recorded in 1961 at New York's Carnegie Chapter Hall (little sister to the famed concert space) is an earnest homage to Dylan's beloved muse Woody Guthrie, growled with endearing conviction. ""This Land"" is followed by a wobbly-voiced ""Song to Woody"" (""I'm singing you this song, but I can't sing enough/ 'Cause there's not many men who've done the things that you've done""); Dylan's unfettered admiration for Guthrie's work is perfectly (and prominently) posed, captured six years before Dylan perched himself on Guthrie's deathbed. Both feature Dylan's early caw and watchful strums, his veneration for Guthrie's politics and practices heartbreakingly rendered. </p><p>
    
    Dylan has always been an especially convincing protest singer, and given the post-Katrina events of the last week, his heartfelt rendition of ""This Land is Your Land"" is almost too much to take: it may be every Kindergarten class' premier singalong, but ""This Land"" is still one of the most elegant and subversive folk songs ever written. Guthrie's anthem was scribbled in terse response to Irving Berlin's comparably one-sided ""God Bless America,"" and the song's telling fourth verse (typically censored in service of patriotism) seems just as apt now as it did in 1940: ""One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple/ By the Relief Office I saw my people/ As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering/ If God Blessed America for me."" Appropriately, ""Song to Woody"" features Dylan's response: ""It's sick and it's hungry/ It's tired and it's torn/ It looks like it's dying and its hardly been born/ But hey Woody Guthrie, I know that you know."" Guthrie and Dylan's distress is palpable, thick: Nudge your dial, put CNN on mute, and sob yourself to sleep. (Don't stop when you get to ""Masters of War"", or, worst of all, ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall"").</p><p>
    
    An early demo of ""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright"" (sometimes circulated as a part of the Witmark Demos) sees Dylan cawing with atypical prettiness, his guitar nimble and soft. Recorded in Lou Levy's office at Columbia (""I opened my guitar case, took the guitar out and began fingering the strings. Lou had put a microphone on the desk in front of me and plugged the cord into one of the tape recorders, all the while chomping on a big, exotic stogie,"" Dylan writes), ""Don't Think Twice"" justifies the purchase price of <em>No Direction Home</em> all on its own: Levy had Dylan recording original songs, which would eventually be transposed into sheet music and offered around to other artists, Brill Building-style. Accordingly, Dylan seems less concerned with perpetuating his own mythology than with capturing the grim soul of the song, and we're rewarded with three and a half minutes of pure, un-smirking, alarmingly honest Dylan (read: three minutes more than usual).</p><p>
    
    Disc Two features some outstandingly weird studio outtakes, including Take 9 of <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em>'s ""Tombstone Blues"", complete with loping fuzztone bass, backing vocals, noodling by guitarist Mike Bloomfield of the Butterfield Band, and Dylan's own giggles. Largely electric, Disc Two also offers a source-tape recording of Dylan's infamous 1965 Newport Folk Festival performance of ""Maggie's Farm"", where he plugged-in, brazenly defaming the acoustic-only preservationists present, most of whom had comprised much of his fanbase (supposedly, Pete Seeger was hovering nervous backstage, muttering to himself and threatening to cut the power lines.) The Newport Folk Festival had long admitted a thorny relationship with amplifiers, even when the music demanded magnification-- festival organizers often stuck howling blues musicians with tiny, whispering stacks, smugly denying their right to wail. Even though Dylan had released the largely electric <em>Bringing It All Back Home</em> earlier that year, ""Maggie's Farm"" was ultimately received with a mixture of limp, knee-jerk applause and wildly dissatisfied boos-- and folk music changed.</p><p>
<em>No Direction Home</em> is fairly essential listening for Dylan enthusiasts and an interesting history lesson for everyone else. Not only is American politics skewered and forked apart, but one songwriter's artistic evolution is laid out bare. As ever, Dylan reminds us that there is plenty left to learn.</p></div>"|2501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2501-no-direction-home-the-soundtrack-the-bootleg-series-vol-7/|9.3|Amanda Petrusich

    Formed in 1965, they played lean, hard-driving boogie and had a sharp-cut,
    stylish image in a San Francisco scene that was more about free love,
    secondhand clothes, and 28-minute modal jams. That raucous, explosive
    version of the band lasted until 1972, when original vocalist Roy Loney left and guitarist Cyril Jordan took the reins, moving them to Britain.
    There, they hooked up with roots rocker Dave Edmunds, who produced a session
    for them that pointed toward a distinctly different path, one deeply
    indebted to the British Invasion sounds that everyone else had moved on
    from.</p><p>
    Amongst their Stones-influenced cuts lay two of the most
    exquisite power-pop tracks of the 70s, ""You Tore Me Down"" and ""Shake Some
    Action"", which gave its title to the album the band made in 1976 after a
    lengthy recording hiatus. <em>Shake Some Action</em> was in every sense both a
    comeback and a re-invention, and it's been rightly championed by collectors and critics extolling its effortless pop
    perfection. If it had been released in 1966, it could have been a smash and
    a popular landmark, but a decade later, the Spector-loving sound and
    Beatle-loving songcraft (they even covered ""Misery"") sank like a stone in
    the marketplace. It would be one thing if the record merely aped an era the
    band had spent playing other music, but the Groovies had the songs and
    nuanced understanding of the music needed to elevate themselves above
    pastiche.</p><p>
    ""Shake Some Action"" itself is a minor masterpiece of jangling,
    harmony-soaked guitar pop, an instantly memorable song that piles wave upon
    wave of hooks on a solid backbeat, all wrapped up in big, wet reverb. It's a
    classic in every way except one: Almost nobody's heard it. A shame, because
    it's just the tip of the iceberg on an album stuffed with great tunes. There
    are six covers amongst the 14 tracks, following the blueprint of the
    original British Invasion records, and with the exception of ""Sometimes"" and
    ""Misery"", the band uses these as their license to revisit their more raucous
    rootsötheir take on ""St. Louis Blues"" is especially good, though they're not
    as convincing on Chuck Berry's ""Don't You Lie to Me""-- their version just
    doesn't have the angry bite it needs to succeed.</p><p>
    The band's other originals, mostly penned by Jordan and fellow
    singer/guitarist Chris Wilson, range from the majestic ballad ""I Saw Her""-- a
    slow, spooky, even operatic track stuffed with the band's best harmonies and
    some truly knockout lead guitar-- to the speedy rocker ""Please Please Girl""
    (one guess whose early singles it sounds like). ""Teenage Confidential"" is
    another magisterial ballad, though it harkens even further back, with the
    ring of 50s tear-jerkers and teen idol pop. ""You Tore Me Down"" and ""I Can't
    Hide"" are sweeping ear candy with to-die-for melodies and accomplished
    solos.</p><p>
    One thing that's striking, considering when the album was released, is its
    efficiency and brevity. In an era where five songs in 45 minutes
    wasn't uncommon, they jammed 14 into a 36-minute runtime, meaning that the
    album is a concentrated sugar bomb. This has lead to some revisionist
    positioning of the band as forebears of the punk explosion, but it's a
    specious claim at best, even if the Ramones did open for them on a tour of
    Europe. The Groovies were simply cut from a completely different cloth.</p><p>
    It's about time this album got a proper reissue treatment in the band's home
    country, and the DBK Works people have done a great job putting together an
    informative package, though don't come expecting any bonus material, because
    there is none-- in fact, it's thought that the extra tapes from the
    album sessions were destroyed. Remastering helps
    immensely, too, clearing up the sound a great deal over previous CD issues
    of the albumömy old copy was an Australian import that sounded like garbage.
    Remastering can't actually change the production of the record, though, and
    if there's any complaint to be had with <em>Shake Some Action</em>, it's that
    Edmunds' work at the boards is sometimes too hazyöhe was recording them like
    a harder rock band than they were at that point, and truthfully, a slicker
    sound would have helped.</p><p>
    The flawed production, however, does not dim the quality of the album. <em>Shake Some Action</em> is, quite
    simply, one of the best guitar pop albums ever made, and its lack of popular
    notoriety is more a symptom of its timing than anything else (it's tough not
    to think that the band's name made things a little harder, too). Hopefully,
    having a high-quality version of it readily available will help more people
    to hear it. The Groovies made only one more good album (<em>Flamin' Groovies Now!), before embarking on a confusing series of
    relocations and reunions, but </em><em>Shake Some Action</em> stands as their
    crowning achievement.</p></div>"|3286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3286-shake-some-action/|8.5|Joe Tangari

June began singing with the Carter Family at age 9, when the precocious child was harmonizing on the family signature song, ""Keep on the Sunny Side"", and taking a solo with ""Oh Susannah"" (which she pronounces with an extra syllable-- ""oh Susie Anna""). The first disc in this two-disc set focuses on her early career, with songs performed by the Carter Family and the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle alongside solo tracks and duets. As much as it tracks the various lineups that played barn-dances around Appalachia during the 1930s and 1940s, this disc traces June's growing confidence as a singer and comedienne. That confidence is evident on tracks like ""I Guess I Told You Off"" and ""Baby It's Cold Outside"", with Homer &amp; Jethro, and grows through later songs like ""Strange Woman"" and ""Without a Love to Call My Own"".</p><p>
    
    Admittedly, many of these songs are mere trifles-- short entertainments full of virtuoso picking from her mother and sisters and lots of cornpone humor from June. This is no criticism: These songs are apt showcases for June's gracious wit and robust vocals, and their primary purpose was to rouse all-ages audiences, which makes them part country music, part vaudeville. Heard outside their original live context, these songs lose something essential but still sound complex and amusing, so we can only imagine the impact they had on their original listeners.</p><p>
    
    June's third husband joins the Carter Family on the first disc's final track, a full version of ""Keep on the Sunny Side"", although Johnny's presence is hinted at on the previous track, ""Ring of Fire"", performed by the Carter Family. Gone are the mariachi horns and the gravity of Johnny's vocals; in this earlier version, a simple drum taps out a two-step rhythm and a chorale of voices testifies to the overwhelming risks of love like a church choir singing a hymn to God-- thankful, yet awed.</p><p>
    
    According to the second disk of <em>Keep On the Sunny Side</em>, June and Johnny's inevitable collaboration didn't initially pay off. ""Jackson"" still sounds like a barnstormer, but its complex view of a cooling marriage offsets the sentimentality of their duets on Tim Hardin's worst song, ""If I Were a Carpenter"", and Kris Kristofferson's ""The Loving Gift""-- both of which suggest that a woman's ultimate act of love is procreation. Johnny also pops up in the jokey ""Slewfoot"", which, coming so soon after their duets, seems to be exploiting their very public relationship. But really, it's just another vaudeville song like ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"", only this time performed in the studio instead of on the stage.</p><p>
    
    That distinction is important. Despite its overbearing production, the studio material on the second disk isn't necessarily inferior to her earlier live songs, but it does afford her far fewer opportunities to showcase her outsize personality. Often she inhabits characters-- like the reformed harlot in ""The Shadow of a Lady"" or the woeful gunman in ""East Virginia Blues""-- but never with the liveliness and commitment with which she played Aunt Polly or Little Junie. June needed an audience, her autoharp, and a few agile pickers and fiddlers. But she had her moments in the studio, such as the duet with her husband on ""Far Banks of the River Jordan"", which proves eerily prophetic. And the final three tracks, taken from the last few years of her life, reveal a gritty authority in her aged voice. <em>Keep On the Sunny Side</em> ends with yet another version of the title track, recorded in 2001. At 73 June sings those lyrics with the same determined pluck as she did at 9, revealing an artist whose hopefulness proved as solid and indefatigable as her voice.</p></div>"|1817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1817-keep-on-the-sunny-side-june-carter-cash-her-life-in-music/|7.7|Stephen M.

The band claims to mix 70s rock with modern indie and pop, and cite ELO, Supertramp, and Steely Dan as their biggest influences. After hearing <em>Hard Times are in Fashion</em>, I'll grant them this: They have pianos. Opener ""Why Bother At All"" adds an extraneous barrel-boogie piano line to it's jerky new-wave rhythm. ""Back on Forth"" follows, a joyless mid-tempo track where Suchan chokes back lyrics like ""We can go back and forth on this one/ Always in denial/ About a president evidently cheating/ Through that awful smile"", sounding not only smug, but clumsy.</p><p>
    
    So here's my suggestion: Listen to <em>Hard Times Are in Fashion</em> in reverse. If you want to hear the record Koufax claim to be making, you'll hear it most in closing track ""Colour Us Canadian"", and much more in the album's second half than in its opening songs. ""Canadian"" opens on a sassy piano strut with only a few squaks of single-note guitar, and somehow pulls off the sweeping faux-string keyboards in the chorus without sounding cliched. Suchan's words hint towards Americans lying about their background when traveling abroad to avoid criticism and just try to fit in (""We never bothered to learn anyone else's language...We heard their jokes, and we wanted in""). 70s pop-prog it isn't, but it has one foot firmly in the unhip past and shows personal, relatable insight in its lyrics.</p><p>
    
    The galloping drums on the penultimate track, ""Her Laughter"", are far more kinetic than <em>Hard Times</em>' opener, and ""A Sad Man's Face"" is another stubbornly catchy piano-driven number. ""Steven James"" crams two or three of the album's best hooks into one song, and Suchan hits upon a charm here that overcomes his range (either cooing or yelping, and mostly the latter).</p><p>
    
    The following batch of songs-- the woozy march of ""Trouble will Find You"" or the strum-happy ""Five Years of Madness""-- are fine, inoffensive songs, but are stingier with the swagger or melody. ""Get Us Sober"" switches rhythms and instruments so many times, it seems adrift in it's middling tempo. ""Blind Faith"", however, is a well-paced, confident ballad with surprising restraint, given the youthful exuberance on the rest of <em>Hard Times</em>. Its lyrics dip back into shallow political perspective (""The mothers want and need to know/why and where their sons must go""), but the performance is strong enough to let it slide. ""Isabelle""... well, ""Isabelle"" would make a great closer. Forget those two closing (er, opening) tracks, albums are too long these days anyways. Let that familiar pedal steel guitar finish a record that appropriates the spirit, if not the craft, of some oft-ignored giants.</p></div>"|4522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4522-hard-times-are-in-fashion/|6.4|Jason Crock

Since its inception, BRMC has seemed oddly well-primed for anticlimactic dissolution, but rather than slumping away from the stage, leather jackets retired to mothball-stocked closets, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club has opted to regroup and pilfer a new musical spectrum, this time tackling classic American blues, country, and gospel. The trio has traded in their pedals and sneers for slides and acoustics. Guitarist/vocalist Robert Turner has reverted back to his given name, Robert Levon Been (originally changed to distance Been from his father, Michael Been of 1980s rockers the Call). Vago is back, smiling peacefully. Dunked in the Mississippi, BRMC are reborn.</em></p><p>
    
    There may be something awkwardly rote about BRMC's sudden interest in capturing gothic country goo (""Fault Line"" features an extended harmonica solo; T-Bone Burnett cops multiple gratis in the liner notes), but <i>Howl</i> is still considerably more compelling than the bellowing, Jesus and Mary Chain retreads the band formerly relied on. All the Oasis posturing and <em>NME</em>-drool puddles made it easy to forget that BRMC were actually born in blue-sky California, and their new album title, which groaningly salutes periodic San Francisco-resident Allen Ginsberg, gently reminds listeners of the band's scraggly American roots-- which is appropriate, given all the rising-south thievery BRMC is indulging here for the very first time. The snag is, heartless posturing is still heartless posturing, no matter how sharp the change of scenery: at its best, <i>Howl</i> twists slide guitar and acoustic strums into vaguely convincing neo-Band jams, and at its worst, it sounds like cartoon-Americana (shockingly, unplugging your guitar and cawing about Jesus doesn't make you country.)  Still, it's that tension-- between classic BRMC bluster and squeaky Delta organics-- that makes <i>Howl</i> an unusually interesting record.</p><p>
<i>Howl</i> is predominantly acoustic, but so sopped with fuzz and echo that it actually manages to sound much bigger than it is. BRMC have hinted at Jack White-ian fetishes before, but <i>Howl</i> is still a remarkable departure for the band, and their trademark druggy dirges are noticeably absent here. ""Devil's Waitin'"" (sort of embarrassingly) mines Johnny Cash's lyrical stash, all Jesus and prison, proclamations about life and the Devil growled over careful acoustic strums and tiny wisps of pedal steel. The song's closing coyote <i>Howl</i>s-- bayed gently, with cactus-stuck, old west conviction-- give way to a three-man hum-along, and finally slip into a gospel vocal swell (even the echoes seem to scream ""We're in church!"") Lead single ""Ain't No Easy Way"" is jammed with raucous steel guitar riffs and harmonica canoodling, all country-rock stomp and barn dance fervor. BRMC's natural penchant for the loud and bombastic work well here; surprisingly, ""Ain't No Easy Way"" is a perfectly convincing throwdown, oddly free of awkward contrivances. Much of ""Gospel Song"" is whispered, slipping in and out of thick full-band buzz, plodding on and on but never actually landing anywhere particularly interesting; opener ""Shuffle Your Feet"" starts with an a capella ""Time won't save our souls!"" whine, before slipping into a handclapping, honky-tonk rhythm.</p><p>
    
    There might be a tiny hint of desperation fueling much of <i>Howl</i>, but ultimately the record is an oddly earnest experiment for BRMC, and once they learn to drop the weird, obligatory signifiers, their new direction may actually prove more fruitful than their last: Cramming together brash rock snottiness with meek country hollers is hardly uncharted territory (not that it matters), but BRMC's particular mash-up still makes for a strangely intriguing party.</p></div>"|773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/773-howl/|7.0|Amanda Petrusich

    Harvell astutely suggested that reissue culture is like archaeology-- no
    matter how artifact-rich an excavation site might seem, there comes a
    time when nothing remains but dirt and some rocks. This analogy can
    easily apply to music of the moment, but instead of ""archaelogical dig,""
    think ""gold rush"" or ""dot-com boom."" Prospecting magnate discoveres
    heretofore untapped resource and makes a nice chunk of change from
    exploiting said resource, and suddenly everyone and their pet therapist
    is out there with a sifting pan and a domain name, trying to get a piece
    of the pie.</p><p>
    
    In case you just joined us: A chic bandwagon to hop on board right now
    is this family-sized ""whatever the hell you want to call the deluge of
    alternative post-punky new-wave"" jalopy. If you're like me, you'll
    gladly go back for seconds more often than not. If you're like Jess,
    you'll suckerpunch the chef and piss in the fish tank. And regardless
    of quality, the signal-to-noise ratio is going to favor the static. For
    every Killer success or act of Bravery, there are numerous acts that go
    straight from Boardwalk (or Baltic Avenue) to the dollar bin, left
    waiting for their reclamation at the hands of next generation's LTM.
    And, like Jess said, sometimes these folks end up on the margins because
    they were marginal in the first place.</p><p>
    
    So, yeah, Hard-Fi: class-conscious lads from the UK with the right
    records in their collection do it themselves, get the kids and press to
    sing and dance along, then get a sugar daddy to help them do it on a
    grand scale despite the dodgy band name. And, hey, now they can add
    ""Mercury Prize nominee"" to their CV. One of the first sounds on the
    album is the toot from a melodica drenched in echo; now you know why I
    bothered with the introduction. Despite some interesting accoutrements
    (tasteful trumpets yay, bombastic strings meh) and some game attempts at
    eclecticism (acoustic pluck wicked, piano ballad oh geez), <em>Stars of
    CCTV</em> is of a part with the varied guitar-driven stuff that their
    fellow Mercury nominees-- Bloc Party, Kaiser Chiefs, etc.,-- have offered
    folks this past year.</p><p>
    
    Their ""Take Me Out"" is called ""Hard to Beat"", which shows that, between
    shots of <em>Entertainment!</em> and <em>London Calling</em>, Daft Punk has
    in fact been played at their house. This example notwithstanding,
    Hard-Fi's attempts to pitch woo to hot girls in love aren't as
    successful as their paeans to working for the weekend. To wit: ""Living
    For the Weekend"", a sonic twin to ""Hard to Beat"", though its disco magic
    points more towards Donna Summer than to French guys in Battlestar
    Galactica helmets. Hard-Fi fight for their right to party (""Unnecessary
    Trouble""), they struggle to make ends meet (""Cash Machine""), and they
    yearn to get the hell outta Dodge (""Tied Up Too Tight""). And,
    occasionally, they wonder about going to war and being under constant
    scrutiny and ending up in prison.</p><p>
    
    It's this sense of the personal politic that separates Hard-Fi from the
    rest of the nu-wave pack. Clearly, the Clash received a few more spins
    than the Go4. Instead of offering hi-falutin' conceptual treatises,
    Hard-Fi infuses their message with a grounded sense of place that's not
    just tied to London. The search for culprits in the wake of the London
    subway bombings lends a bittersweet taste to the twerpy sarcasm in the
    album's title track (""We're the stars of CCTV/ Making movies out on the
    street"")-- this sentiment could just as easily apply to any number of
    invasive acts carried out under the aegis of the Patriot Act. The
    marginalized West London kids in ""Tied Up Too Tight"" could be the kids
    from down the block or one town over. And when HM Young Offender
    Institution &amp; Remand Centre Feltham sings out, it sounds like the
    long-predicted riot could begin at any place, at any time. In other
    words: If you find this in the dollar bin next year, consider yourself
    very lucky.</p></div>"|4011.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4011-stars-of-cctv/|7.3|David Raposa

And though each of these releases offers a unique and valuable entry to the prolific Kentucky/Michigan trio's ever-suppurating noise, for my ticket </em><em>Drawn Dead</em> is the slightly more compelling of the two. It's almost inarguably Hair Police's most doggedly single-minded release to date, as its four untitled tracks combine to essentially form one continuous ashen flow, an unearthly current that represents the group's most self-assured departure yet from the more punk-centric splatter of earlier releases like 2002's <em>Blow Out Your Blood</em>.</p><p>
    
    Recorded live with no overdubs, <em>Drawn Dead</em> pitilessly captures a doomed sonic wreckage that Hair Police have succinctly described as ""the sound of a burning human body."" Though performed by the trio's regular line-up of Mike Connelly (Wolf Eyes), Trevor Tremaine, and Robert Beatty, the instrumental line-up here is unorthodox even by the group's nebulous standards. Without a true percussive in sight, drummer Tremaine joins Connelly on guitar and occasional vocals, while Beatty manipulates the proceedings electronically in real-time.</p><p>
    
    But the description of their process or set-up alone does little to prepare the listener for the album's patiently devised ambient crawl, since few of these generated drones and scrapes originate from easily pinpointed sources. Instead, in a manner reminiscent of Merzbow's grainiest abstractions, the group's various thrums here frequently coalesce into a single unified black-lit beam that sweeps scythe-like across the countryside, mowing everything in its trajectory down at the ankles.</p><p>
    
    Viewed from a safe distance, the surfaces of <em>Drawn Dead</em> can appear almost lifelessly monolithic and static, but upon closer investigation one can see that these tracks actually teem with movement and action. Over the course of the album's first two tracks, mud-caked walls of feedback and crackling distortion build, then collapse, then build again, while unsettling echoes, pauses, and stereo-panning techniques ensure perpetual listener disorientation. And just as you're beginning to get a feel for this murky new habitat, the 11-minute third track enters, raining shrieks of industrial detritus and disembodied spectral cries over the sickly, low-lying amplifier growls, before the brief finale sets everything spinning off in the undertow of its dark tide. It's an impressive performance in its own right, but when taken in conjunction with <em>Constantly Terrified it signals that Hair Police are open for engagement with any mutated extremity of noise that crosses their collective snares, making their future possible directions seem virtually limitless.</em></p></div>"|3985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3985-drawn-dead/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

    of electrowhatever, what with his long black hair and cigarette ash beard
    and general air of swarthy French sleaziness. As one half of Black Strobe,
    he forced EBM (aka ""industrial disco,"" aka ""stuff my goth ex liked"") and
    electro to fuck, and then fed the baby steroids in its milk. (In other
    words, it's electro. But, like, really fucking loud and ugly electro.) As a
    DJ he's defined his strain of electrohouse (better names on a postcard, as
    always) as a kind of heads-down, gray surge-- house stripped of the euphoria
    or maybe techno with the male equivalent of camel toe. (What is that, frog
    eyes?)</p><p>
<em>Fabric23</em> doesn't deviate from the plan too broadly, though converts are
    quick to hail it as ""NEW STYLE FROM IVAN, 16TH NOTE DELICIOUSNESS"" in true
    shop-blurb style. As my boy Phil noted a few Months in Techno ago, everyone
    is worshipping the riff as if they've all grown Troggs haircuts and are
    dragging their knuckles down. Ivan does know a bassline when he hears it,
    usually in short blurts of boom that occasionally reach out to slap you
    awake in case you're nodding off behind the wheel. The whole of the mix
    kinda sags, like a hammock filled with rainwater, or a humid fog oppressing
    a coastal town in mid-July.</p><p>
    Aswefall's ""Ride (Der Schmeisser Lovelysplinter Remix)"" (jesus guys, edit)
    is fetid with low end, and Ada's remix of Booka Shade's ""Vertigo Vs. Cha!""
    is thick and gloopy in the now accepted Areal style. Michael Mayer's
    ""Heiden"" fills the requisite Kompakt spot on a 2005 mix, though I'm
    surprised he went with the clicking melodies of DJ Koze's ""The Geklöppel
    Continues"" rather than the sewer-funk of the expected ""Brutalga Square"".
    Towards the end he even throws in the Kills' ""No Wow"", which isn't quite as
    incongruous as it may appear. Sandwiched between the colonoscopic grumble of
    Tekel's ""Snake Tartare"" (title!) and the matte techno of Konrad Black's
    ""Jefferson and Braeside"", the Kills track might as well be any of the other
    is-it-techno-that-wants-to-be-rock-or-vice-versa? that makes up the bulk of
    the mix.</p><p>
<em>Fabric23</em> is smoking, yes, but it's also kind of a bummer. I am all for dance
    music which steals a little a little swagger from cock rock. Maybe not all
    the time, mind you, but it's a healthy corrective against the twin black
    holes of good taste and excessive abstraction. Unfortunately, it's a weird
    kind of rock purism Smagghe leans on, not all that different from the
    excessive abstraction of minimal techno when it comes right down to, just
    with a biker's build instead of a heroin addict's. Is one anthem too much to
    ask Ivan? Or am I missing the point?</p></div>"|7830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7830-fabric23/|7.2|Jess Harvell

    González (Swedish, obv.) to reach these shores, and it's easy to see
    what nudged it here. González's sparse recordings showcase
    hushed, double-tracked vocals, haunted imagery, and a clearly gifted
    classical guitarist. His gripping acoustic cover of countryfolk the
    Knife's electro-pop ""Heartbeats"" was even a minor hit in his homeland. An ethereal, sometimes-aloof troubadour, González will sing
    you to sleep and then dash off under cover of night, leaving only
    cold-sweat nightmares and an unopened bottle of sweet vermouth.</p><p>
    Yup, two years, and on <em>Veneer</em>, González suggests he'd kinda
    like to stick around for a few more. Permanence is a pressing concern:
    With bongos and a hint of bossa nova, ""Remain"" emphasizes
    perseverance, while the scant lyrics of handclap-enhanced ""Lovestain""
    complain of the marks you can't just shout out of you heart, maaan.
    The arrangements are full of Nick Drake-style
    open tunings (""Stay in the Shade"", in particular, can't escape the
    shadow of that introvert-folk patron saint) and only a forlorn trumpet
    on closer ""Broken Arrow"" disrupting the
    guit/vox/maybe-tasteful-percussion train to Starbucks-comp paydirt.</p><p>
    As with like-minded songstress Emiliana Torrini, González is at his
    best when he forces a personality onto his faceless raw materials. The
    distinctive finger-picking on ""Crosses"", the best original song on the
    disc, rises like the spires of a Gothic cathedral, giving form to
    lyrics about a redemptive light in the darkness (any religious
    inferences, meanwhile, are left entirely to the listener). By
    comparison, sotto voce opener ""Slow Moves"" tries a little too hard to
    sound like its quiet-is-the-new-loud forebears, with a meta-chorus too
    wispy to hold tight 'til morning: ""My moves are slow/ But soon they'll
    know"".</p><p>
    González's aforementioned ""Heartbeats"" cover is nearly as
    spine-tingling as the original, if not its frenetic Rex the Dog remix.
    Echoing M. Ward's ""Let's Dance"", Iron &amp; Wine's ""Such Great Heights"",
    and Frente!'s ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", González strips the electro-pop
    down to an acoustic lullaby, laying bare a powerful melody and
    deceptively evocative lyrics about love, regret and nostalgia.
    González has also covered Kylie Minogue's ""Hand on Your Heart"", and
    the gulf that remains between these must-hears and his self-composed
    material is significant. González knows a great song when he hears it,
    and he plays a mean guitar, but in 2003 he was still more raw than the
    overseas buzz suggested; <em>Veneer</em> is nice, but it may just
    scratch the surface.</p></div>"|3682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3682-veneer/|7.0|Marc Hogan

At the time, it was simply a quirky leftfield hip-hop record by a guy who burned grass like a wildfire and lived in Peanut Butter Wolf's basement-- like literally lived in the basement studio known as the Bomb Shelter. No one knew that Madlib preferred the solitude of the studio to pretty much anything else and that records flowed from his mind and sampler at a dizzying pace. Now, thanks to endless profiles and album reviews, we know, and it makes <em>The Unseen</em> even more interesting.</p><p>
    What once seemed a crafty producer's gimmick now sounds more like the imaginary friend of a shy dude who needed someone to talk to in the studio while he chain-smoked blunts. Reefer Madness? Probably, but wildly entertaining, as well, imagining Madlib sitting in a basement making songs all day everyday and getting so bored with himself that he finds a way to put a pig-nosed yellow hippo on record. And most of what he says under that persona is crazy shit, outlandish, hilarious fiction. Exactly what everyone stands around thinking about when he's got a helium balloon pinched in his fingers is what comes out of Lord Quas' mouth. We all know profanity is crass, violence a nuisance, and misogyny quite boring, but dude, his voice sounds funny when he says it.  Whether it's the grandiose self-shout-outs, ludicrous threats, or adolescent come-ons, Quas is Webster with pimp juice while Madlib leans on the wall, mumbling affirmations and encouragement, and if you want to justify the content to your stuffy friends just tell them the pitch-shifted vocals are Madlib's commentary on the mental immaturity and irresponsibility of typical hip-hop subject matter.</p><p>
    Of course, the main attraction of any Madlib record is his production, and <em>The Unseen</em> holds up particularly well because Madlib hasn't changed this particular strain of his beatmaking all that much. Instead of tinkering with his style, he creates a new one. When he wanted to do some live jazz, he did Yesterday's New Quintet. Street bangers went to the Jaylib album. Pop remixes, reggae mixtapes, instrumental 12""s, nothing stays on paper with Madlib. So anyone who slobbered over <em>Madvillainy</em> or <em>The Further Adventures of Lord Quas won't be disappointed by the now five-year-old production, nor should they skip Lootpack's Soundpieces or MED's <i>Push Comes to Shove</i>. If anything, </em><em>The Unseen</em> is a better ""album"" than <em>Further Adventures because the compositions are more fleshed-out, more cohesive and, well, more. Madlib has a short attention span, but he kept most of the songs to almost three minutes here without much junk. The jazz and soul samples are as obscure and well-selected as ever, with Madlib's particular style of chopping a drum sample keeping the beat from becoming a bore. The skits and interludes play to the mood, and the seamless transitions, which usually include a bonus beat or two, echo the give 'em more of DJ Premier of Gang Starr. </em></p><p>
    I can't say for sure why <em>The Unseen</em> is being re-released, other than Madlib didn't a have another record ready this month. It's a nice treat for the Serato kids to have the full instrumentals on one CD, which is included. And if there's anything to be learned from George Lucas, it's that trusting the public to remember how awesome you are is a fool's paradise. Legacies are constructed, and with the new Quasimoto album still on the New Release wall, it doesn't hurt Madlib or Stones Throw to jog some memories. I'm sure Quas would say, ""Buy my shit, or I'll cut your head off and smoke green out your socketholes,"" or something to that effect.</p></div>"|6613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6613-the-unseen/|8.5|Peter Macia

Who <em>doesn't want to get behind Alison Goldfrapp and company? She's nothing if not on the ball, having transformed herself from elegant mid-90s Orbital cooer to elegant late-90s spook to an equally timely role-- something like a cross between Kylie Minogue and PJ Harvey, between Annie and Siouxsie Sioux, between Rachel Stevens and Beth Gibbons, the evil-twin model of the shimmery dancefloor princess-bot. And </em><em>Supernature kicks off with that flag flying high, on ""Ooh La La"": some hard schaffel, some hand-clapping glam-rock stomp, some dangerously icy taunting, and enough Germanic electro-house action to make you want to drop it like it's cold, ruthlessly efficient, and strangely angular. Why do I have a sick suspicion that this is how awesome Peaches <i>thinks</i></em> she sounds?</p><p>
    
    So I do half-go for it, from that first rush of ice to the veins to the dots of old-model cabaret spook that crop up later, and from there through the buzz and pulse of the inbetween. Witchy English vibes, analog synth surgery, superhuman icy-vulnerable vocals, and production that sounds alternately like high-polish chrome and a sucking black hole: What more do I usually ask for?</p><p>
    
    Well, something, obviously, because somewhere along the line I lose it. Maybe it's the part where Alison wants to ""ride on a white horse,"" though I suppose there's both a half-decent hero/heroin joke and a T. Rex reference in there. Maybe it's the part where I remember that I have Gary Numan and Siouxsie albums I still haven't listened to it enough. Or maybe it's just the peculiar plaint of the electro dance-pop full-length: the sound of those mid-tempo album-completing tracks. They're effortlessly organized, full of so much dense trebly shimmer and helium swooning and sighing that you actually zone out and stop hearing them, right up until you realize your ears hurt a little from taking it all in. They're loads of effort poured into a product that winds up sounding like nothing in particular, immaculate synth arrangements not quite making up for the fact that the song will neither bang and swell nor relax into a dreamy lull. If Alison were Kylie, she could at least spice things up by switching modes-- sunny here, earnest here, then back to machine-tooled intimidation. Alison, being Alison, has to stay all witchy all the time.</p><p>
    
    And there's the non-shocker: This is sure to sound better in the variegated sweep of a good DJ mix-- something that's not, given the present currency of ""electro-house,"" so difficult to come across. The bangers here will sound fab on the pop ends of said mixes, ""Ooh La La"" owning all. The tracks that lapse back into Goldfrapp's old <em>Felt Mountain electronic-chanteuse mold will sound fine in your apartment. (""U Never Know"" and ""Let it Take You"" make a gorgeous break from the ultra-dense buzz, getting progressively softer, silkier, and more minimal.) But plenty of these tracks keep feeling like exercises: too thick and melodic to work like dance music, but with melodies that refuse to stick as satisfyingly as pop.</em></p><p>
    
    Which makes this pretty much what you'd expect: the prime-time flagship of glammy electroid dancefloor pop, curiously expensive-sounding and accessible to all, but strangely stripped of the functionalism of the dance record and the full thrills of pop. Sometimes that lands it in the sweet spot. Just as often, though, it seems to have forgotten what in the world it was meant to offer in the first place.</p></div>"|3506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3506-supernature/|7.0|Nitsuh Abebe

    build a sturdy wall of sound and look pretty fucking amazing while
    doing it. The 50-something Japanese musician's a legend in the
    noise/improv scene, and though his hair's taken on gray streaks, he
    seems otherwise ageless in his trademark black
    leather and black sunglasses.</p><p>
    
    Often pigeonholed as a shadowy guitar screamer, Haino
    claims to have mastered over 80 noisemakers including digital
    theremin, air synth, hurdy-gurdy, wave drum, all sorts of percussion,
    and various indigenous instruments. His inclusive aesthetic blows between
    minimalism, folk, medievalism, and sublime drone; he also leads his
    own cover band, Aihiyo, and the psych-rock power duo Fushitsusha.
    Comfortable alone or with an avant posse, he's collaborated with
    Ruins, Faust, Boris, Charles Gayle, Merzbow, Jim O'Rourke, and Derek
    Bailey, among others. On his most recent pair of enigmatic recordings,
    Haino keeps to himself, showcasing his vocal prowess alongside often surprisingly clean, mostly processed guitar.</p><p>
    
    Focusing on African-American blues, <em>Black Blues</em> is a pair of albums,
    though they aren't packaged together. It's unclear why Haino didn't opt for a double disc, but fans
    will want to hear both. The tracklists are identical and the only
    difference in the packaging are reversed/mirrored covers. Musically,
    one's quiet (""acoustic""), the other loud (""electric""). If you need
    help in the store, print out the following and bring it with you: On
    the ""acoustic"" version Haino's looking to the left and on the
    ""electric"" version he's looking to the right. Keeping them apart's fine (the confusion's kinda great), but it's also
    worthwhile experiencing the loud and soft in interaction, observing how
    intentionality can morph and then re-shred even a recognizable
    standard like Blind Lemon Jefferson's ""See That My Grave Is Kept
    Clean"".</p><p>
    
    Whether enjoyed together or singularly, the albums make
    great use of silence and space (the electric in a more jarring, less
    pin drop manner). On the ""acoustic"" collection, Haino's spacious playing brings to mind
    Loren Connors (a past collaborator) and New Zealander Roy
    Montgomery. It can get very quiet: Parts of 13-minute ""Black
    Eyes"" are so immensely whispered, the stereo needs to be pinned as
    high as possible to catch the ambience. Vocally, Haino's a psychedelic
    solitaire exhaling black and white. In ""The Town in
    Black Fog"" he whispers evocatively into your ear, a guitar strumming
    in the distance. Some tracks aren't as secretive: Everything's
    upfront on ""I Don't Want to Know"", a ballad with chords that drift across into each other no matter how carefully they're spaced. Haino's voice
    is often evocative, even pretty. The tour de force is the
    previously mentioned ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"". (As on a few
    of the tracks, the guitar doesn't sound especially ""acoustic."") His
    voice registers as near falsetto while he lethargically strums; when Haino brings it down a notch, it's amazing to
    witness one of our noisiest guitarists turns out moth-wing
    ethereality.</p><p>
    
    When he ""plugs in"" for set two, an angry demon
    emerges in a different part of the graveyard. Seconds into ""Black
    Petal""'s opening chords there are already stab wounds; eventually
    Haino unleashes absolutely anguished screams. The electro ""Black
    Eyes""'s three minutes briefer than its acoustic-minded sister; Haino
    knows how to play loud softly, so its guitars are layered and
    sustained but subtle. He approaches Mecca Normal slashing on
    the catchy ""I Don't Want To Know"", which is as rock as it
    gets. And the best? Again, it's ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"".
    This take explodes with an anguished vocal aneurysm and deliberate,
    reverberating guitar waves. It delivers a fitting purification
    rite before a high-pitched swath of feedback punk slaps the finale.</p><p>
    
    To say <i>Black Blues are mysterious records is an understatement. That
    they aren't for everyone is redundant. The vicious loudness delivers a
    few wonders of texture, raw rasp, and might be
    recognized first in the crowd due to its forceful attitude. But,
    really, it's the delicate acoustic movement-- subtle,
    enormous, secretive, inaudible-- that best channels and
    transmogrifies classic blues into exorcism.</i></p></div>"|4018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4018-black-blues-acoustic-electric/|7.8|Brandon Stosuy

We'd hope David Edwards aka
    Shockface would just go all the way musically, too-- <i>Maritime</i> for the
    most part is folktronica that masquerades as post-rock that masquerades as...-- but nope, there's not a single rapper anywhere on this
    record.</p><p>
    
    Instead we get Manitoba's <i>Start Breaking My Heart Part 2</i>. Which is no
    slight, since Manitoba's IDM debut is one of few such slabs worth talking
    about. Some tracks here forget their melodies but valiantly gadget their way
    through: Strip a Sufjan song of everything but its chirpy horns, woody blocks,
    and xylo phones, and you might have a ""Muesli"". (You are encouraged to read
    this last sentence in a Jeff Foxworthy voice.) And perhaps you forgot about the
    existence of the band Tortoise; ""(She's in) Dry Dock Now"" has not only the
    courage to glitch-pluck its strings, but the prescience to prefuse the ones and
    twos-- a Tortoise 73 cover before the Tortoise 73 original post-drops? I was
    double-fisting sandwiches in the VIP at the time, but I think I heard dudes play this song
    at Intonation.</p><p>
    
    When the Shock does muster a strong melody, he makes a synth-pop jam out of
    it, and those are <i>Maritime</i>'s better moments. There's this band with
    Hollywood-branch Amoeba Records employees, I think they're called the Ray
    Makers-- anyway, for you L.A. cats still bummed about my Weezer tracks review
    from six fucking months ago, that reference point is my atonement. ""Six Foolish
    Fisherman"" fakes the funk, but ""Luck Shield"" is ""Mr. Magic"" in neon, with
    Wurlitzer-like flutters on the head and a killer quiet bells flip. Sorry
    though, Pink's is an ugly man's Nathan's.</p><p>
    
    There's a love song, too-- ""Mistaken Tourist""-- and it's anxious to fill my IDM
    love song quota (0.75 love songs). But the soft squelch lead and pulled strings
    and cutesy bells come off a bit too well-intentioned, especially coming from an
    act whose very namesake was, shall we say, <em>Veneris monumentum nefandae.</em></p></div>"|5315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5315-maritime/|6.2|Nick Sylvester

Most of their pun-filled song titles are mouse-related-- either dealing with cheese, traps, or the rodents themselves. If it weren't for the disturbing barrage of noise on <em>ASSPhIXXXEATATESHUN</em>, the whole thing might come off as either oddly cute, blandly gimmicky, or as some sort of PETA protest. But the only things the White Mice seem to be protesting are good taste, traditional song structure, and anything remotely resembling a melody.</p><p>
    
    The noise-metal miscreants use drums, bass, and an oscillator to create a gloriously god-awful racket. Most of the songs clock in at around two minutes and follow the grindcore style of relentlessly bludgeoning the listener over the head with brutal drums and distorted-beyond-recognition instruments. The vocals, which are buried in the mix, seem to consist primarily of howls and wails, at times so seamlessly blending with the squealing feedback that it's difficult to tell there's a human behind them.</p><p>
    
    The songs that come closest to having a structure are the longer ones, comparatively speaking. ""Limburger Baby"" spends an echoing minute building up a spacey, sci-fi atmosphere before busting wide open into a full-on assault. ""Mouse Trap"" begins with swirling oscillator tones leading into a jerky rhythm that plays out for the bulk of the song. The title can even been heard over and over beneath the horror of alarm-clock buzz and booming bass guitar. Similarly, ""Slo Poison"" suits its name, creeping through three-and-a-half minutes of sludge as if it's slowly shutting down your nervous system.</p><p>
    
    While everything on the disc could certainly qualify as noise, there are several tracks that wear that label more obviously than others. Opener ""Foreskin Rug"" utilizes sliced-and-diced rushes of buzz-saw tones on top of slo-mo rumble. ""Dieorhearama"" picks up this theme nine songs later and adds the swoosh of back-masked drums and squealing feedback on top.</p><p>
    
    The disc's final track is ""Microjackass"", which spans almost 50 minutes (over twice the length of the other 10 tracks combined). Over its first four minutes the song builds in speed and intensity before fading to static; by minute five, silence has set in. It's not until 43 minutes later that we get the final burst: a quick blast of a repeating drum and bass beat, ringing oscillator tones, and a telephone operator delivering a voice-mail message. While it's been a common gag since the early 90s to include a bonus track at the tail end of a CD, forcing the listener to wear out the fast-forward button accessing the track, it seems here that the silence is a part of the song.

On the other hand, it's not at all what it sounds like: It's actually really good. Surprisingly good, and surprisingly often-- good enough that I spent half of my first listen wondering if I was really going to wind up giving it a better rating than the original. Weird, right?</p><p>
    
    Maybe I shouldn't act so shocked. It's just that something's gone wrong with the rhetoric around the word ""dance"" lately. Suddenly it's considered perfectly normal to say any given uptempo guitar band from north of the English Channel is some kind of ""dance"" group, something that just isn't true according to anything but mid-sixties standards. (""Hey look, it's popular dance combo the Dave Clarke Five!"") Bloc Party may have a pretty good rhythm section, but that doesn't exactly make them Masters at Work, does it? But wouldn't you expect the fashion of the day to dictate that their occasional hustles get remixed and extended out into a series of faux bangers, something to throw on when the club's mysteriously overrun with indie kids and you need a cheap way to get them on the floor?</p><p>
    
    And here's the trick: The best of these remixes don't even dream of that. The best of these remixes use beats as not much more than a grid around which to reorganize the raw sounds of the original tracks-- a frame around which to tweak the sound of Bloc Party into something a little more fractured and abstract. It's Sheriff Whitey's mix of ""Helicopter"" that seals the deal. Instead of the sound of Bloc Party lushed up and given groove, we get the sound of some alternate-world Bloc Party, one that's more interested in rocking spare and spindly, like Wire, than their usual habits of scripting professional-sounding twists and turns. When I reviewed <em>Silent Alarm, I said that being a good ol' unchallenging rock band was this group's biggest strength; for the length of this mix, it sounds like they've traded in a little of the ""ol'"" and the ""unchallenging."" For a few stretches of tracks, it's a best-case scenario: all of the hot performances and satisfying hooks without the slight aftertaste of plain-old-band boredom.</em></p><p>
    
    So it's really only a lull in the middle that keeps it from topping the original, and even that gets redeemed fairly quickly. A surprisingly-limp Erol Alkan mix gets followed up by what might be the best thing here: Dave P. and Adam Sparkles making a sunny 80s number out of ""This Modern Love"", complete with handclaps and some synths at the end that leave the whole thing feeling like the Cure jamming out on ""Just Like Heaven"". (Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs leaves ""Compliments"" sounding like a whole other Cure, actually.) It's the same trick again-- it sounds like something some bizarro version of the group might actually play, if they'd just chill out for a second and stop trying to be so damned grand.</p><p>
    
    Others try to isolate just that grandness. Ladytron push the vocals from ""Like Eating Glass"" way back into the ether, behind a tense, unchanging thrum, for an effect that's like walking out of your apartment and thinking you can hear Bloc Party playing a festival six blocks over. (Black Strobe's typically grim-as-hell floor-crushing mix of this song might have been more exciting, but we have a theme to work here.) M83, a group whose formula is as easy to predict (and as hard to fake) as Boards of Canada's, wrap the vocals from ""The Pioneers"" around a long sweep of synths and strings. ""Luno"" gets drawn furthest from the original aesthetic, thanks to Death from Above 1979 laying in a big buzzy heap of their own hard-rock scuzz. Closest to the expected rock-gone-dance template is DFA associate Phones' old remix of ""Banquet"", which works just like it's supposed to (i.e., wouldn't mix so strangely with ""You Spin Me Round""); closest to the pop-gone-remix template is Four Tet's chimes-to-drones take on ""So Here We Are"", more M83 than M83, and smack in that Superpitcher-remixes-Postal-Service sweet spot.</p><p>
    
    Surprise: It's all a good fit with the sound of the original. It's Bloc Party's old-fashioned ""every track a single"" aesthetic that makes this project possible; it's their hyper-ambitious ""Technicolour"" recording and ultra-precise performances that give the remixers so much sharp material to work with. After a few months with the original, you could start to feel like Kele Okerere was trying a little <em>too</em> hard to fill his vocals with non-stop passion, but here it's a boon-- grab any snippet of singing and it's ready to isolate, ready to wail. So the band makes a rock-solid professional-sounding pop/rock record, and here come some folks with their computers to make it a bit more <i>formally interesting as well: not a bad deal at all, right? </i></p></div>"|1131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1131-silent-alarm-remixed/|8.0|Nitsuh Abebe

    Crafts, I sharpened my repertoire of trusty
    Canadian jokes, drooling at the opportunity to once
    again tackle the Great Indie Wilderness Up North with
    my razor wit. But alas, it was all for naught, as it
    turns out New Buffalo hails from another British
    Commonwealth, the one that used to be a prison island. So while my hockey, snow, and fox-trapping jibes are
    put back into storage, I am caught unprepared to make
    childish, snide comments about Australia.</p><p>
    
    Despite their different origins, New Buffalo doesn't
    sound out of place among the maple-leaf-heavy stable
    of Arts &amp; Crafts. Like much of the label's populace,
    New Buffalo sounds like a franchise of the Broken
    Social Scene conglomerate, and, given the three dozen
    or so people in that flagship outfit, for all I know
    main protagonist Sally Seltmann has contributed to
    their communal noise. Even if she hasn't, the songs
    on <em>The Last Beautiful Day</em> have the same sort
    of dreamy-indie qualities Broken Social Scene has
    built their empire upon, an aesthetic that sounds like
    a glossary of the last 20 years of indie rock.</p><p>
    
    Seltmann concentrates largely on the
    mellow side of this history, as much of the album puts
    me in mind of BSS' starry, ephemeral ""Anthem for a
    Seventeen-Year-Old Girl"". There's also a bit of a Cat
    Power thing happening here, with Seltmann excelling at
    the same sly, breathy vocal style as Miss Stage Fright
    herself. But there's considerably more optimism here
    than Chan Marshall would ever allow herself, as well
    as more complex arrangements than is usually found
    adorning a singer-songwriter's keyboard campfire.</p><p>
    
    Both of these differences can be heard to good measure
    on ""Recovery,"" which undercuts the sunshiney
    twelve-step lyrics with jittery click-rhythms and
    sudden horn stabs. Many of the best tracks on <i>The
    Last Beautiful Day</i> sound like Seltmann is getting
    bleedover from the IDM band in the studio next door, culminating in the Air-ishly
    psychedelic ""No Party"". This of course makes Lazy
    Critic Angle #1 (just above ""she's on Arts &amp; Crafts!"") ""Sounds like an Estrogenized Postal Service!,"" but
    it's a not bad comparison-- just like TPS, New
    Buffalo's beat-tourism can lift otherwise pedestrian
    material (""I've Got You and You've Got Me"") yet
    sometimes sounds cosmetic and extraneous (""It'll Be
    Alright"").</p><p>
    
    Most of these computer-aided experiments are
    frontloaded; as the album goes on, the arrangements
    become sparser, Seltmann's sometimes-shrill voice is
    higher in the mix, and many of the unique elements
    that marked the first half are abandoned.
    Fortunately, there's a last-minute save with ""On
    Sunday"", an eerie track built entirely from jazz
    samples, right down to preserving the dusty-groove
    crackles, that wouldn't sound that out of place on a
    Jan Jelinek project. So apart from the occasional
    relapse into singer-songwriter solo-arrangement
    temptation, Seltmann proves herself a forward-thinking
    indie-folkster, not one to shy away from technology.
    With a little more development, New Buffalo might even
    develop a sound strong enough to dispel the Candadian,
    Northwest Michigander, Australian stereotypes.</p></div>"|5919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5919-the-last-beautiful-day/|6.8|Rob Mitchum

    actual surfing and migrated to kitsch. Dick Dale had ""Pipeline"", the
    Surfaris had ""Wipe-Out!"", and Man...or Astroman? had...""You Can't Get
    Good
    Riblets in Space"". But although shuddering tremolo bars fit the image of a guy in floral print trunks, the music is mostly instrumental and as such
    essentially abstract, so you can make it mean anything you want it to.
    Even
    early surf rockers like the Ventures and the Tornados realized this and
    began to incorporate the astronautical, lounge, and kitsch elements that
    color most efforts in the genre these days.</p><p>
    
    So the term ""surf"" as it relates to music today basically just refers to
    music
    with lots of reverb and crazy guitar playing, which is fine-- you can
    acknowledge the roots without trying to turn them into branches. I can
    say
    pretty categorically that Croatia's Bambi Molesters are the best surf
    band
    in the world today, but given Man...or Astroman?'s long silence,
    Daikaiju
    certainly have a claim to the #2 spot. Much like fellow modern
    surf-rockers
    Los Straightjackets, the men of Daikaiju keep their identities secret,
    each
    represented by a mask in the band's press releases, which also feature
    a lot
    of fake Japanese-to-English translations like ""Kabuki men deliver most
    high
    rocket impact!""</p><p>
    
    Students of Godzilla, Mothra, and Gamera know that Daikaiju is Japanese
    for
    ""giant monster,"" and the Huntsville, Ala., quartet are obviously
    enamored
    with the most conspicuous aspects of Japanese popular culture, though
    they
    refrain from sticking soundclips from Mechagodzilla sequels all over
    their
    albums the way so many other surf groups recently have. They instead
    opt to
    let the music speak for itself, and when it does, it's impressive, to
    say
    the least. Though their sound is closer to Man...or Astroman? than
    anything else (it's of course possible that there are members of that
    band
    hiding out in their ranks) there's a certain degree of prog muscle
    behind
    all that reverbed shredding.</p><p>
    
    Surf is one of those funny genres where a fan basically knows what to
    expect
    and enjoyment comes from hearing it done really well, and Daikaiju
    delivers
    on that score, but there is one monumental surprise lurking in this mix
    in
    the form of album closer ""Farewell to Monster Island"". At almost nine minutes long it's nearly four times longer than the average surf
    instrumental and in place of the manic snare and ride cymbal of a surf
    beat,
    the band rides a skanking dub riddim, marrying two genres that in
    retrospect
    were born to love each other. The e-bowed interlude is something to
    hear,
    but even more impressive is the simple fact that the guitarists hiding
    behind these masks have a jazz-like sense of how to phrase a solo. The
    song
    is the kind of jam that bands just don't do any more, and it sort of
    makes
    me wish more would.</p><p>
    
    So in the end, Daikaiju is an impressive full-length debut for a band
    that's
    clearly got more up its sleeve than a few Trashmen 45s and tablature
    print-outs for ""Rabble Rouser"". The thing with the masks and stage
    names
    like Secret Asian Man and Brain Conflict is frankly little more than a
    distracting sideshow to the main event, which is of course the band's
    massive wave of prime surf. Grab your board.</p></div>"|2622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2622-daikaiju/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Their Saddle Creek debut at least had voluminous Mogis production to breathe in some reluctant life, sounding like chopped and screwed Bright Eyes, but its Bar/None follow-up, <em>I Know Your Troubles Been Long</em>, had no such saving grace. Wisely, Mayday have returned to Saddle Creek for their third and finest LP, <em>Bushido Karaoke</em>, and mixing duties are split between A.J. Mogis and the equally deft Andy LeMaster. But the album's overall success can't be hung upon the recording alone. Trading in his former syrupy drizzle for a more varied, gothic take on American mythology, Stevens' songwriting has become much livelier and grittier; at its best, it channels the theatrical noir of Nick Cave.</p><p>
    
    The piano-rock shuffle ""Pelf Help"" is the first indication that Stevens has been immersing in the classic Sun Records catalog, although its crunchy guitars align it more with American Music Club. Stevens has attained better command of his limited vocal range, inflecting richly within it instead of pushing against it: ""We had more fun when we were poor."" Romanticizing poverty is questionable, but no one likes a parvenu, and there's resonance in lines like ""You may look dashing now/ But I remember when you were beautiful."" ""Booze &amp; Pills"" is another straightforward '50s rocker, swinging instead of shuffling; an addiction ballad with jaunty, nauseated brass. And standout track ""Standing in Line at the Gates of Hell"" is pure Starvations melodrama, bitter and desperately seething, with its funerary chords and howled vocals. A vivid seediness rushes through it, climaxing with the declaration: ""I'm the new barkeep at the Tavern of Lost Souls!"" File under purgatory, Sisyphus, overstated fun.</p><p>
    
    The record is fleshed out by songs more in the ""old Mayday"" style-- see the honky tonk twang of ""Continental Grift"", the ontological ruminations of ""Hidden Leaves"", and ""Rock and Roll Can't Save Your Life"", which is musically slight yet lyrically deft (""But it just might save tonight"")-- and a variety of covers and tributes. INXS's ""Old World New World"" is recast as a sort of panoramic bluegrass (maybe Stevens is going to try out for <em>Rockstar</em>?), and Gilliam Welch's ""I'm Not Afraid to Die"" as up-tempo rockabilly. ""Burned my Hands"" is a woozy, forgettable slow-burner borrowed from Neva Dinova's Jake Bellows, and ""Dave D. Blues (How to Make it Sting Like a Career)"" trades Stevens' measured lines for Dondero's more rambling style. Mayday always sounded comfortable tilling their well-worn ruts, maybe too comfortable. On <em>Bushido Karaoke</em>, they've discovered a way out-- passion, humor, and a touch of deviltry.</p></div>"|5163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5163-bushido-karaoke/|7.5|Brian Howe

Considering the consistency of the group's canon, it seems at worst you're getting double the fix. Fortunately, the duo's split follows the Lennon-McCartney model, though with microcosmic stakes. While Taylor sticks to easy-to-swallow dream pop, Fink embraces spirituality and mysticism along with more challenging songwriting. The intrepid <em>Invisible Ones</em> exposes Azure Ray as less than the sum of its parts, though Fink's Björk-sized ambitions constantly grapple with her colorless adult-alt tendencies.</i></p><p>
    Harpsichord-laden opener ""Leave It All"" proves Fink capable of orchestration beyond guitars and processed strings. The song's languorous pace doesn't guarantee the packaged happy ending so familiar in Saddle Creek circles, not to mention Fink's spiritual gravitas: ""The god to whom I prayed/ Played a trick on me good/ Now I see his face, it's just as well/ I leave it all."" Fink parlays similar moral and spiritual conflict into several gripping ballads, tapping Flannery O'Connor Cliff's Notes and Haitian traditional music she encountered on a recent trip there.</p><p>
    A Haitian choir accompanies Fink on the haunting ""Les Invisibles"", delivering the necessary ooh's and harmonizing for the Stygian chorus: ""We raise our hands and pray/ Les Invisibles/ We hold our heads in shame."" The song's musical twin, closing track ""Animal"", features tribal rhythms and call-and-response vocals between Fink and the choir, though she overshoots the poignancy of the trite, repeated line ""Who are you?"" Unlike these ornate compositions, Fink's sparser ballads offer a starker and more realized perspective of the album's heavy leitmotif. Fink prudently lays down playful yet somber piano melodies, hedging her own apocalyptic countenance in the process. Glum narrative ""Invisible Ones Guard the Gate"", for example, gets away with lines like ""Prophets, pimps, angels, whores/ There ain't no devil, there ain't no lord"" because of its strangely jaunty piano line and blasé relationship with the dejected accompanying instruments.</p><p>
    Sadly, subtle tidbits like this are about the closest Fink comes to liveliness. ""Bloodline"" is a one-and-done rocker that's too dolled up and self-aware as a single to really grab anyone. The gauche string arrangement on ""Blind Asylum"" hints at a sense of humor, but can only do so much in two minutes to counteract an album's worth of doom. However, Fink's sepulchral fixation isn't inherently damning. Sufjan Stevens, for one, has proved a topic like original sin can actually propel one's music to unprecedented levels. Unlike Stevens, though, Fink hints at optimism solely through her lyrics, with little redemption musically. If you're striving to restore faith in a world of ""prophets, pimps, angels"" and ""whores,"" you gotta do better than Sarah McLachlan melodies and a rented Haitian choir.</p></div>"|3348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3348-invisible-ones/|6.8|Adam Moerder

That's fine, to a point. Their stately, melodic indie pop gives them a big enough palette with which to paint albums that don't lose their flavor on the bedpost overnight, but it also means that their records can feel interchangeable.</p>
<p>On <i>Plans</i>, the band's fifth album, Death Cab made the jump from the friendly confines of Barsuk Records to the storied halls of Atlantic, a move that makes a lot of sense. The band is ready for the large, diverse audience a major can provide, and they make the transition seamlessly, in large part due to the underrated production of guitarist Chris Walla, who has a way of making even the weirder flourishes (and the band tries a few to mixed success here) feel totally natural.</p>
<p>Despite Walla's consistently cozy production, Ben Gibbard's lyrics continue to move from critiques of middle-class life to tackling Big Themes, here the relationship between death and love. On ""What Sarah Said"" he claims, ""Love is watching someone die."" On ""I Will Follow You Into the Dark"" it's the title sentiment, and on ""Soul Meets Body"" he says, ""If the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too.""</p>
<p>""I Will Follow You..."" is the album's quiet centerpiece, just Gibbard on acoustic guitar, his fragile, almost falsetto tenor, simple delivery, and unexpected turns of phrase turning an well-worn lyrical road, the fear of losing a lover, into something affecting. The way he personalizes the afterlife and draws in childhood Catholic school experiences is impressive, to say the least. All this and it's sequenced directly after the album's most musically ambitious track, ""Different Names for the Same Thing"", an overly melodramatic track that heads off on a ponderous, M83-aping electronic odyssey.</p>
<p>The band's other, better experiment is lead single ""Soul Meets Body"", a sleek pop track that excels except for when the drums drop dead, the textures get all smooshy, and Gibbard goes up the scale to sing the title-- it's such a weird blunder that it's hard to tell at first if it derails the song or just nudges it a bit. Several listens in, the song works on the strength of its catchy ""ba da ba da ba ba"" passages and the incredible verse melody, but that one little passage is awkward, like the song has something stuck in its teeth. Death Cab opens the album strongly with ""Marching Bands of Manhattan"", a song that feels like it's constantly in the process of taking off, with pensive drumming and big, sweeping vocals singing about sorrow seeping into your heart as if through a pin-hole.</p>
<p>For its peaks, the album also has its share of valleys, like ""Summer Skin"", notable mostly for its nifty bassline, and ""Your Heart Is an Empty Room"", a song that never breaks out of its musical holding pattern. The band suffers from the infliction: Death Cab still sounds basically the same as ever in the post-""O.C."" world. In a way, it's comforting to know what you're getting: Four or five songs you'll treasure, four or five you'll tolerate, and a pretty good band sticking to their guns. In another sense, it would be nice if a band reaching for a larger audience had a sound that matched that sense of ambition.</p></div>"|2233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2233-plans/|6.5|Joe Tangari

    from the start releasing a greatest hits album, but that's what Supergrass
    did last year. Bands that get
    old tend to get all ""mature,"" and the last thing a band like Supergrass needs
    is maturity-- their best songs thrive on youthful energy and a naive
    appropriation of influences you didn't know could be mixed together.</p><p>
    
    So I was hoping for a mid-life crisis on <em>Road to Rouen</em>, the band's fifth
    album. The terrible pun in the title is a good start, but they're
    still mellowing, settling into their success and putting
    their swagger in a less visible place. They're good enough songwriters that
    they can survive slowing down a bit, but there's no question that this is
    Supergrass' least-exciting album yet.</p><p>
    
    Granted <em>Road to Rouen</em> does have a fistful of
    killer moments during its brief under-40 runtime. You get the swamp-rocking
    title track and its companion ""Kick in the Teeth"", which together make up
    the album's late-energy burst. ""Road to Rouen"" is stuffed with nasty
    descending riffs and volume pedal swells to back up Gaz Coombes' blue-eyed
    soul croon. On an album that resides mostly in slower tempos, it becomes
    clear just what a great singer Coombes is: He has a rich, nuanced voice that
    sounds great shouting or navigating a delicate melodic phrase.</p><p>
    
    ""St. Petersburg"" is something of an underwhelming
    lead single, a mid-tempo shuffle on which everything from the piano to the
    vocal is merely workmanly; the most interesting thing in the song is its
    stretchy string arrangement, which twists and pulls like taffy. It doesn't seem like something
    that would make the <i>Supergrass Is 20</i> compilation in 2014. More likely
    candidates include album opener ""Tales of Endurance (parts
    4, 5 &amp; 6)"", a song that plays a lot like something from the band's
    self-titled third album, with a lengthy intro of acoustic strumming, piano.
    and echoing slide guitar. Trumpets and strings break in to announce the
    groove and the band slinks through a darkly funky verse, finally
    exploding after a second orchestral interlude into a big, stomping chorus
    with shades of ""What Went Wrong (In Your Head?)"".</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, Supergrass doesn't really ever harness any of the momentum they
    create on individual songs to make a truly great LP, throwing away the peak
    they reach on the epic, six-and-a-half-minute power ballad ""Roxy"" on a
    meaningless, jokey interlude called ""Coffee in the Pot"". There's a lot to
    love here, and Supergrass is still a killer band when they get in their
    groove, but there's definitely a noticeable lack of the hunger that once
    dripped from their music, no sneer to bring it all crashing home. <em>Road to

Over a prodigious
    musical career (nearly 20 albums so far), the long-haired Englishman
    known as the Bevis Frond has likewise dealt in dusted-off, literate
    psychedelia, even earning a spot on Rhino's <em>Children of Nuggets</em>
    box. Recording mostly solo on vintage equipment, Saloman alternates
    between squealing hippie jams, fuzzed-out indie-pop and stately,
    pastoral folk. His voice is wounded, elegant and scrupulously
    unaffected. <em>London Stone</em>, the latest Rubric reissue in
    Saloman's series of turn-of-the-90s lo-fi neopsych primers, was
    intended as the follow-up to 1991 magnum opus <em>New River Head</em>,
    but the band's U.S. label chief took a pass, leaving the album without
    distribution here-- until now.</p><p>
    
    As any veteran vinyl hunter knows, the story should end with <em>London
    Stone</em> (plus bonus traxx!) triumphantly taking its place as the
    Frond's lost masterpiece. After an unaccompanied, traditional fiddle
    piece by guest Barry Dransfield, the record certainly gets off to an
    impressive start with ""Coming Round"". The album's best and poppiest
    tune builds into dueling jesusfuck guitar solos, both played by
    Saloman 'course, and sees this Mascis-like dinosaur admitting, ""I come
    from a different age."" ""That Same Morning"" can stand proudly
    beside to contemporaries like Teenage Fanclub with its jingle-jangle
    acoustic guitars. Live favorite ""Well Out of It"" knocks out teeth with
    chunky grunge riffage; ""Still Trying"" is an uptempo Farfisa-ish organ
    stomper that easily bests most of the recent garage-rock revivalists.
    ""Lord of Nothing"" sticks out pleasantly enough as a slightly twee
    British folk song in the mold of Richard Thompson.</p><p>
    
    A few tracks too often, however, Saloman winds up adding too little to
    the gems in his evidently formidable LP collection. In the liner
    notes, he admits to waxing ""Hendrixiano"" on ""Living Soul"", which
    blisters and bluesters somewhere between ""Purple Haze"" and ""Crosstown
    Traffic"", but that doesn't make it memorable. Title track ""London
    Stone"" opens with the many-times familiar, distortion-laden chords of
    ""All Along the Watchtower"", then closes with another Dransfield fiddle
    solo-- which will come as an unwanted dorm-room flashback for anyone
    who went collegiate during the Dave Matthews regime. But don't ask me
    to explain why ""A Most Singular Hole"" (""There's a hole in my life and
    I fill it up with doubt"") is better than a well-shroomed jam band with
    the right pedals; it's not.</p><p>
    
    It speaks well for Saloman that even in 2005, when many of his
    original selling points have supposedly become uncool-- authenticity,
    virtuosity, faith in the redemptive power of rock and/or roll-- that
    so many of his songs still thrill in their own right. The bonus
    tracks, too, are always at least passable, from an illuminating demo
    version of ""Coming Round"" to an arguably superior version of the
    album's ""And Now She's Gone"", plus unreleased tunes (of which
    acoustic, haunting ""Scavenger"" is the most worthwhile). Completists
    who own the original will want to seek out the reissued <em>London
    Stone</em> for these. Alas, good luck finding it on vinyl.</p></div>"|686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/686-london-stone/|6.8|Marc Hogan

Though outwardly the group's foursquare, whiskey-soaked country-rock remains as wry and ornery as ever, on many of these tracks a distinctive air of bitter, spiteful resignation has crept in, leaving the album with a depressive, hungover pallor around its gills. And while by this point one could never question the Brothers' zealous devotion to their cause, nor their unimpeachable talents as a riotous live act, one can't help but wish that their righteous anger more frequently translated itself into similarly fiery, unrestrained abandon in the recording studio.</p><p>
    
    For their first album since 2002's <em>New Deal, the Waco Bros. have scaled back on their twang slightly-- and on the vestiges of actual punk almost completely-- and have now cozily settled into a tempered Crazy Horse/Skynyrd mid-range classicism. Early in the group's career the Wacos were often perceived as merely another of Jon Langford's numerous side projects away from the Mekons-- and rather a play-acting novelty at that. But they've long since matured into a true, fully democratic band, and here Langford splits microphone time with guitarist Deano as well as mandolinist Tracy Dear. Performances are stout if generally uneventful throughout, and often it's the tasteful pedal steel contributions of Mark Durante (formerly of Revolting Cocks and KMFDM) and the relentless pummel of drummer Steve Goulding (who's played with everyone from Graham Parker and Elvis Costello to Archer Prewitt) that rescue these tracks from their most hidebound roadhouse tendencies.</em></p><p>
    
    ""What if our history means nothing at all?"" worries Deano on the opening blue-collar lament ""Nothing At All"", a Son Voltish scorcher that immediately (if unsurprisingly) reestablishes the Wacos' alignment with the woebegotton, put-upon underdog. This can't-win-for-losing stance leads the band quite naturally to the election night blues of ""The Rest of the World"", (""Champagne's still on ice/ Might as well down it tonight/ It ain't going to last four more years/ Nor are your rights,"") as well as to Langford's exquisitely vindictive Bush diatribe ""Chosen One"".</p><p>
    
    On the well-titled ""Drinkin' &amp; Cheatin' and Death"", Langford returns another of his favorite barn-sized targets-- commercial Nashville country. Over the album's best woozy hook he drops the newsflash ""Country radio lost its balls/ And started selling fantasy/ No drinking, no killing and the only divorce is from reality,"" tidily bringing up-to-date those listeners who've been comatose or otherwise out-of-pocket for the past couple decades. Elsewhere, the Brothers direct barbs at reality TV (""Fantasy""), crass materialism (""Lincoln Town Car""), and Intelligent Design (""Missing Link"") with varying degrees of wit and subtlety, but unfortunately the band's staunch musical conservatism ensures that none of these tracks ever ventures far from the predictable. <em>Freedom and Weep</em> culminates with the raucous, misery-loves-company anthem ""Join the Club"", an appropriately cheerless finale for what's arguably the Waco Brothers' most accomplished but least fun album to date.</p></div>"|8553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8553-freedom-and-weep/|6.6|Matthew Murphy

    in addition to a number of live recordings and odds-and-ends
    collections. They amassed this much material without a break, steadily
    releasing records and touring since the still-great <em>The Trinity Sessions</em>
    put them on the map in 1988. The band also retains a solid base of fans devoted to its distinctive countrified folk-pop.</p><p>
<em>Early 21st Century Blues</em>-- released on the band's own label-- is a concept album, the subject matter of which
    you can probably guess from the peace sign painting on the cover. At the start of the year the band members met to discuss ideas for songs that addressed
    current political issues-- war,
    violence, greed, and so on. Over a few days they recorded nine covers
    and two Michael Timmons originals. Cowboy Junkies have always been
    skilled at absorbing the songs of others into their aesthetic, and for
    the most part this album flows like a collection of originals written to
    a theme.</p><p>
    
    This is the record's biggest plus, the way Cowboy Junkies still
    evoke a convincing mood of deliberate contemplation. The flawless
    diction of singer Margo Timmins keeps the lyrics in the foreground, each
    line clear and plain as the spare, subtle musical backing. The band's
    long stream of Bruce Springsteen covers continues with ""Brothers Under the
    Bridge"" and ""You're Missing"", both of which sound great in this
    environment. At their best, they can help you find new things in old
    songs. Turns out Bob Dylan's ""License to Kill"" from <em>Infidels</em> actually has a
    gorgeous melody wrapped around the cryptic and evocative lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Still, although there will always be certain comfort in Margo Timmins'
    voice, her limitations are frustrating. She can certainly
    <em>deliver</em> a song and make you hear the craft that went into its
    creation, but she never really <em>inhabits</em> one. She's never done
    abandon and has always preferred being a conduit for a songwriter to
    imparting her own personality. So the more familiar the song is, or the
    more the arrangement and production is pushed to the background, the
    less interesting the track becomes. Contrast Cowboy Junkies' plodding
    take here on George Harrison's ""Isn't It a Pity"" with Galaxie 500's
    untethered cover from <em>On Fire</em>. When we hear U2's ""One"" we can appreciate
    the song's mighty chords but never feel that sense of elevation. And
    then there's the cover of ""I Don't Want to Be a Solider"", which augments John
    Lennon's verses with fresh new rhymes from guest rapper Rebel. It's not
    as bad as ""guest rap on a Cowboy Junkies album"" would lead you to
    believe, but it's a misstep from a band that's done a surprisingly good
    job avoiding them.</p></div>"|1642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1642-early-21st-century-blues/|5.7|Mark Richardson

Those who claim Kanye West's antics hinder his work are missing the point. His self-importance is obvious, but the arrogance that comes pre-packaged with his insecurity is what makes West the most interesting hip-hop figure of the past five years. That's the reason he landed on ""Oprah"" and the cover of <em>Time</em> Magazine last week, rather than 50 Cent or Nelly or Slug. It's not sales; it's souls.</p><p>  That said, at the end of the day, it's his ear, a golden instrument, and his adventurous collaborative spirit that have made him the most fully formed artist of his genre.  The sprawling <em>Late Registration</em> is the year's most accomplished rap album, and in turn, he's done something that his heroes-- the Pharcyde and Nas, and father figure Jay-Z-- couldn't do: deliver on a promise the second time around.  With the help of co-producer Jon Brion, West has taken his jumbled personae, buoyant enthusiasm, and vision for the grandiose, and transformed his chattering, seemingly unrealistic ideas into an expansive, imperfect masterpiece.</p><p>  Without Brion, this album probably sounds a lot like its predecessor, <em>The College Dropout</em>-- full of tough horns, jacked soul, and flashes of brilliance. What the former Fiona Apple maestro brings to the proceedings, aside from a conductor's wand and a smile, is the ability to inflate and infuse West's ideas with even more life.  A case in point is ""Hey Mama"", a track that leaked more than a year ago. The song is traditionally purty, dominated by handclaps and a flittering sample of Donal Leace's ""Today Won't Come Again""; basically a trad-Kanye production. The Brion redux inserts a moaning vocoder, tin pan alley drums, a xylophone solo, and cascading synth coda, all without mucking up the heart in the middle.</p><p>  Flashes like this surround the sometimes urbane, often cheeky West with a new resonance.  Where would ""Crack Music"", a blustery martial stomp, be without its soaring choir and biblically extended outro?  Probably somewhere on the Game's album.  Could Kanye have single-handedly fused the showboating old school boom bap of ""We Major"" with its build-it-up and watch it all fall down production without Brion or co-producer Waryn Campbell?  Not likely.  By opening the studio to admired colleagues, he's allowed himself room to think even bigger than the multi-tracked ""Jesus Walks"".</p><p>  On the mic, West sounds sharper and more battle-tested, though he'll never have the effortless insouciance of Jigga or teeth-gritting religiosity of Nas.  To his credit and detriment he continues to surround himself with superior MCs like Common (on the sober ""My Way Home""), impressive newcomer Lupe Fiasco (Just Blaze's life-affirming ""Touch the Sky""), and the ineffable Cam'Ron, who continues his magical run with savant-like witticisms on ""Gone"".  Even Houston's Paul Wall manages to fit ""illuminate,"" ""insinuate,"" and ""caterpillar"" into 16 bizarre bars on the woozy ""Drive Slow"".  All this to go along with curious shouts from two conflicted giants, Jay and Nas, who hang like specters over the album.</p><p>  Unlike the ""great"" hip-hop releases of yore, the productions here are so insistent that even a charismatic voice like West's can become an afterthought.  Only ""Roses"" delivers the endearing sentimentality of ""Jesus Walks"" or ""Family Business"".  ""Diamonds From Sierra Leone (Remix)"" offers some admirable if dubious political grandstanding, but as with every colossal undertaking, you gotta pay the cost to be the boss.  The album's worst track, ""Bring Me Down"", overwhelms with silly orchestral pomp, courtesy of Brion. It also presumes that anyone still cares about Brandy, who sounds like she's recording her voice through a Cuisinart. ""Celebration"", too, is a busy, empty exercise in, well, celebrating.</p><p>  Barring those two tracks, and a few innocuous if unnecessary skits about a fraternity for the financially impaired called Broke Phi Broke, the rest is aces.  ""Addiction"" is unsophisticated in concept but inspired in delivery.  ""Gold Digger"" is also simple but not subtle, tearing into the realm of the obvious with a Ray Charles-aping Jamie Foxx and recycled drums, but succeeding with humor and reverence. Opener ""Heard 'Em Say"" might be the most bandied about joint here, thanks to the presence of Maroon 5's Adam Levine, but guess what?  He sounds great.  Off-key and blue-eyed selling his soul, but like nearly every risk here, the syrupy pop works.</p><p>  ""We all self-conscious"" has not taken on a new meaning post-<em>Dropout</em>.  Conjecture about West revolutionizing the sound of modern hip-hop is mostly a fallacy.  Not much has changed, though a few Brion hacks might appear to offer someone like Cassidy an oboe loop or two.  In general, what makes West's sound and personality so vital is that it is completely singular. The maddening contradiction, the goofball ridiculousness, and the furious fist-raising still comprise an original voice. Though you'll notice I hesitate to use the phrase ""everyman"" to describe West. Not every man could have written a headphones album that'll rattle your trunk.</p><p> </p></div>"|8768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8768-late-registration/|9.5|Sean Fennessey

On the     one hand, it's just a side effect of post-punk necrophilia; at some point,     on or around August 2003, any remaining good (just good!) post-punk bands     had finally been exhumed, renovated, rehabilitated, whatever. That's two     years now of chasing up the lesser lights, dodgy one-shots, side-projects     and general jerk-offery. C'mon-- those Brazilian p-punk comps are bad Cure     demos with a tropical frosting.</p>
<p>Yes, I know the <i>Early</i> comp came out in March 2002. Let's just say ACR was     ahead of the crap curve. The facts remain: Simon Topping still sounds like Ian Curtis Cliff's     Notes. The purported funkiness will still not be backing up any asses. Their     name is just more lamentable Factory Nazi-chic. And there's very little ACR     did that someone (Joy Division, the Cure, Liquid Liquid, Funkadelic, your     mom) didn't do better. This is not to say they didn't have their charms. The     double EP that contained ""Do The Du"", ""The Fox"", their (overrated but still     pretty funny) cover of ""Shack Up"", and ""Flight"" is good fun if you enjoy     mooning with the blinds closed to twitchy approximations of forward     momentum. (And hey, sometimes, who doesn't?)</p>
<p>But when they started fucking with jazz, Latin, electro, disco-- check, pleez.     This is not some sort of inverse pop-snobbery talking. This is a purely     functionalist argument. By 1982, the disco tradition was just that: a     tradition, one where all-night, non-stop dancing was the rule of law. Plenty     of other cultures had been fucking with this for years, and it showed up in     things like northern soul. Even when they tried to bodyrock, ACR were     still hampered by their stiffness and leftover gloom. (Let's not even get     into the inherent racism in the fallback ""but they had a black guy drumming     for them!"" argument. Rhythm != drumming.)</p>
<p><i>I'd Like To See You Again </i>was a swiftly recorded follow up to<i> </i><i>Sextet</i> (the     only ACR release of note after the early singles and half of <i>The Graveyard</i> and the Ballroom and even that's pushing its essentialness). Martha Tilson's     proto-trip-hop vocals on <i>Sextet</i> were at least pleasing to the ear, if still     essentially ballast, but here they're gone. So the band goes for longer     grooves, more instrumental passages, and fewer vocals. I'd call it smart if     the music were better. ""Touch"" acknowledges the new pop that ruled '82, but     refuses to deal with it head on.     ""Showcase"" has slap bass (<i>slap bass</i>). They throw party whistles and     P-Funk backup chants on ""Saturn"", and fair play, they're at least trying to     have fun. But Martin Moscrop's trumpet, once the source of an amusing kind     of fake electric-Miles fog (one thing they had that JD didn't), just sounds     anodyne here. If you listen closely you can hear the beige Howard Jones     records they would soon be making.</p>
<p>A year later, of course, New Order     released one of the biggest 12"" singles in history, tore up NYC clubs like     the Funhouse, and permanently shook the Joy Division out of their hair. They     even got to retain a slight creatures-of-the-night aftertaste that ACR were     desperately distancing themselves from. All in all, ACR must have been     pretty pissed off.</p>
<p><i>Live 1980 was from a show recorded after their fateful trip to the U.S.,     where they recorded their debut album, </i><i>To Each</i>, with Martin Hannett (which     means it sounds exactly how you think it sounds) and had their wigs flipped     by the hustle and bustle of early 80s NYC. And it shows, with a sound that     has the tension between their sketchy raincoat beginnings and the good foot     already breaking down. They're already straining to breath some of that     American air, to suck up that mythical fonk, to banish the sooty taint of     their homelands. Which pretty well killed them as a band. To make matters     worse they avoid their hits in favor of album tracks, and then decide to do     realt-time extended remixes, with lotsa percussion. The reissue includes two     bonus tracks.

Ready your angry emails and dismissive blog posts if you must,     but just think about it the next time your survey your gigs of mp3s, stacks     of CD-R's, or mounds of .99 vinyl.

    Structurally, he makes excellent use of run-on sentences for
    exclamatory emphasis; doubled lines (or more often quadrupled
    hiccups) propel his best songs. The oldie ""My Noise"" jumps with a
    row of fluctuating ""It""'s: ""It rides beside me/ It has no choice/ It's my life/ It is my voice/ It is stupid/ It is my noise."" This sort of stutter pops up time and again in McCaughan's back
    catalogue, and judging from <em>Bright Ideas</em>, the sixth Portastatic
    full-length in 13 years, he wisely avoids a Mouldian aim at
    mid-career eclecticism, and continues the practice.</p><p>
    
    The title track's opening lines hinge on their reps: McCaughan
    adopts an airy Elliott Smith, stuck awhile in clusters of ""I
    thought""'s so multitudinous they'd take up too much space for me to
    quote. Here, as is often the Portastatic case, the point isn't rock
    catharsis. Superchunk remains that predominant space for songs that
    make you bounce on your bed, with Portastatic more about introspection. ""Bright Ideas"" fits that low-key template
    perfectly, the protagonist resting his head on a pillow rather than
    using it as a soft weapon at a high-spirited slumber party. McCaughan
    shakes things up a bit (but just a bit) the rest of the way.</p><p>
    
    In indie rock years, McCaughan's approximately 100. Between Merge,
    which he operates with Superchunk bassist Laura Ballance and various
    high and low-profile musical projects the North Carolina icon's rarely out of sight. How does a centurion
    maintain musical vitality? One approach is to get Conor Oberst to pen
    your overstated press release. The more valiant option: experiment tastefully and
    within your limitations.</p><p>
    
    Doing just that on <em>Bright Ideas</em>, McCaughan plays Portastatic for the first
    time with a full band. Sure, past offerings have included
    guest spots by Sleater-Kinney's Janet Weiss and Tony Crow of Lambchop, but this is McCaughan's most realized rock affair. As one would expect with the fuller
    instrumentation, <em>Bright Ideas</em> is McCaughan's most Superchunk-friendly
    Portastatic collection. Though with Portastatic dispatches arriving at
    more regular intervals than rockers from those slack motherfuckers, the difference feels more like semantics than anything
    else.</p><p>
    
    Unexpectedly, the album features a flurry of decently energized fist-pumpers-- ""Through With People"", ""The Soft Rewind"", and standout ""White Waves"". Each is enjoyable in its way. When McCaughan grows too chill (""Truckstop Cassettes""), tiptoes
    into country (""Little Fern""), or lulls a la mid-tempo Neil
    Diamond/Crooked Fingers (much of ""I Wanna Know Girls"" ), he
    drops his raw nasal register, losing what makes his work compelling.</p><p>
<em>Bright Ideas</em> is more pleasant than kick-ass or inspired. But for an
    album this deep into his career, at a time when he could start growing
    aesthetically antsy, McCaughan sticks to a blueprint that works best:
    He shifts things enough to let us know he's still breathing, avoiding
    the desperate genre-jumping that often afflicts musicians of a certain
    age.</p></div>"|6420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6420-bright-ideas/|6.9|Brandon Stosuy

Her voice recalls Liz Phair without the accusations, and like Patti Smith, she comes off like a poet first and a singer second, although with a much more MFA-friendly style and without the rock-priestess performance. Her songs indulge flights of verbal fancy, like Ben Gibbard but less unctuous. And Veirs is routinely compared to Suzanne Vega for the dryness of her delivery and to Beth Orton for the way she melds folk rock with dance sonics. There is, however, the vague sense on <em>Year of Meteors</em> that she is trying to distinguish herself from these comparisons and even from her previous album, last year's <em>Carbon Glaciers</em>, a breakthrough in Europe and a cult favorite in America. Leaving behind that release's barebones sound, Veirs recorded <em>Year of Meteors</em> with her touring band, the Tortured Souls, which includes bassist Karl Blau, keyboard player Steve Moore, and percussionist/producer Tucker Martine. The result is a fuller sound that, for better or worse, is less like the work of a solitary musician and more like a collaborative effort.</p><p>
    
    These essentially spare songs have been dressed up with full-band arrangements and treatments that employ glittery electronic effects intended both to offset the organic acoustics and to set Veirs apart from every other female with a guitar. Often these additions work well within the songs: the band propels ""Secret Someones"" and ""Rialto"" with pop-song momentum, and Eyvind Kang's strings on ""Fire Snakes"" and ""Parisian Dream"" perfectly compliment Veirs's dreamy lyrics. But often, as on ""Galaxies"" and ""Through the Glow"", these treatments sound entirely superfluous, diluting the potent simplicity of Veirs's understated performance.</p><p>
    
    Besides, Veirs needs no further distinction: despite the justifiable comparisons with artists past and present, she has developed a musical style that is maybe not groundbreaking, but is at least highly personal and distinctively expressive. Lyrically, her songs make abstractions concrete and conjure eerie images and strange associations, some of which belie her background as a geology student. The standout ""Spelunking"" develops an elaborate metaphor that connects subterranean exploration with romantic commitment: ""If I took you, darling/ to the caverns of my heart/ would you light the lamp, dear?"" she asks, before describing the denizens of the darkness-- ""fish without eyes, bats with their heads/hanging down towards the ground."" Veirs confronts everyday subjects with the same imaginativeness and eye for detail: on ""Secret Someones"" she addresses the loneliness of touring: ""O a smile would melt me to an asphalt strip,"" she sings before asking in the bridge, ""tell me, did you make it to the show?""</p><p>
    
    Lyrics reproduced outside of their songs can often sound flat or pretentious, and the words above desperately need Veirs's intonations to achieve their full effect; merely typing them or reading them won't do. For all the decorousness of her music and songs, it's her voice-- usually charmingly flat, precisely overenunciating, and gently assertive-- that conveys the deepest sense of wonder and truly sells these songs. Veirs really doesn't need much in the way of accompaniment: the primary components of her music are voice and guitar. If <em>Year of Meteors</em> feels a little too busy and overworked, so what? Veirs is maybe the gazillionth iteration of the quiet voice and plucked guitar, but she serves as a potent reminder how variable and compelling that combination can be.</p></div>"|8525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8525-year-of-meteors/|7.9|Stephen M.

Your first guitar teacher, the one with the Yes shirt, was not cool. The kid I knew who worshipped Neil Peart, and had a license plate that read ""DRUMGUY"" was not cool. And no matter how much you may love Genesis, that won't erase the fact that Peter Gabriel eventually left Phil Collins in charge. On the other hand, Gospel are cool. Cool enough to get approval from the white-studded belt, sideways trucker hat, back pocket bandana crowd, and the unadorned (and girlfriendless) music geek crowd.</p><p>
    
    What makes Gospel so cool? It could be the patchwork of functional King Crimson via Converge riffs, sprayed out drum work that's reminiscent of Damon Che of Don Caballero fame at his drunkest, and Dazzling Killmen-esque guttural yells. Then again, it could just be that the band sprawls out on a nice medium ground between math-rock and technical hardcore/metal. It's not a crowded genre as the years have shown that heavy bands with prog influences end up becoming black metal, Dream Theater, Ruins, or a brutal prog era Weasel Walter project.</p><p>
    
    It's a good thing Gospel have an entertaining drummer: His corrugated beats are the highest item in the mix. We're actually allowed some prominently displayed keyboard work as well, which is abnormal for a non dancepunk album that's fit to be sold at Hot Topic. But how do you get the kids with scene hair to listen to mutant prog? Just make all the tracks hover around the five-minute mark. Cautious? Of course. But the nine-minute ""A Golden Dawn"" proves why this works-- it's by far the poorest song on <em>The Moon</em>. It fails to shimmer and ends up sounding like an outtake from a Trail of Dead practice.</p><p>
    
    Gospel use the tools of the trade to fix the problems attention deficit listeners (hardcore kids) had with prog. The spiraling arms of the guitar lines and the splotchy drums of ""Yr Electric Surge is Sweet"" bridge the gap between the rage of hardcore and the extensive rehearsal of prog. ""And Redemption Fills the Emptiest of Hearts"" evens manages to inject a perverted version of the most standard of hardcore gimmicks, the breakdown. Sure, they disguise it a little, but not enough to displease the ears of Norma Jean kids, and then they move straight into King Crimson-inspired keyboard and synthed guitar interplay. They even go so far as to make Tool palatable to the underground with the Middle Eastern guitar lines and echoing soundscaped instrumentation of ""Opium"". (I was digging Gospel until they made me reference Tool and lose what little cred I had as a music reviewer.)</p><p>
    
    Tricking the kids would be shameless if I didn't wallow in Gospel's message. Granted, they're displaying their influences a mite too visibly. Gospel strip down their influences to compensate for many of their favorite band's substituting polish for violent energy. Maybe Gospel are cool because they are smart enough to meld prog with today's updated hardcore. But knowing today's hardcore scene, maybe Gospel are just cool because Kurt Ballou of Converge recorded their album and Converge make some of the hippest hoodies on the market.</p></div>"|3681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3681-the-moon-is-a-dead-world/|7.8|Austin Gaines

The band formed at a time when heavy rock music was becoming old and passé, yet despite little radio play and a refusal to bow to music business demands, they managed to sell out stadiums the world over. Bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris had a clear vision of what he wanted his band to be from the beginning: His dedication to complex songwriting, rousing, hook-laden choruses, and a powerful stage show put the band head and shoulders above their New Wave of British Heavy Metal counterparts. In fact, now, almost 30 years later, the only other band from that scene who remains relatively well-known is Def Leppard, and they sound radically different today than when they started.</p><p>
    Perusing the Maiden discography reveals as many live and ""greatest hits"" packages as studio records. In 1996, the band released what was expected to be the definitive Maiden hits package: <em>Best of the Beast</em>. Since then, however, we've seen <em>The Best of Iron Maiden</em>, <em>Ed Hunter</em>, <em>Eddie's Head</em>, <em>Edward the Great</em>, and now, finally, <em>The Essential</em>. And this isn't even counting the live albums.</p><p>
    So why, then, do we need another greatest hits package? I'll leave that one to the accountants. It's a discussion that belongs in the same realm as longtime fans arguing over how they could have possibly left off ""Children of the Damned"", ""Where Eagles Dare"", or ""Can I Play with Madness"". But this isn't a for-fans package; instead, <em>The Essential</em> is an two-disc primer on a band that has released 13 studio albums, recorded upwards of 150 songs, and spent the last 25 years defining a genre. </p><p>
    The tracks here are arranged in reverse-chronological order, a curious choice, but ultimately a good one, forcing attention on newer tracks that may otherwise have been lost. The disc opens with ""Paschendale"" from 2003's underrated <em>Dance of Death</em>. An epic, classic-style Maiden track, clocking in at over eight minutes, ""Paschendale"" shows anyone who isn't familiar with the band's newer catalogue that little has changed over the years. Singer Bruce Dickinson's pipes are as crisp as ever, and the Steve Harris/Nicko McBrain rhythm section is still bombastic and powerful.</p><p>
    From <em>Brave New World</em>, the disc that marked Dickinson's triumphant return to the band, we get ""The Wicker Man"" and the title track. Comeback single ""The Wicker Man"" dispelled worries that the band couldn't recapture the ferocity of its earlier work. ""Brave New World"" starts with mellow, echoed guitar and synth strings, while Dickinson croons over top, but goes on to feature out-of-nowhere time changes, winding solos, and dual- and three-guitar harmonies.</p><p>
    From the mid-90s we get two tracks apiece from <em>Virtual XI</em> and <em>The X Factor</em>. Both albums featured vocalist Blaze Bayley-- an accomplished if not exactly original vocalist temporarily replaced Dickinson. The band could've easily found a clone and carried on, and it's to their credit that they avoided that trap, but it's hard to get over the missing Dickinson. Bayley's vocals are somewhere between Dickinson's and original mic-man Paul Di'anno. He's gruff, but he's got range, able to hold a note with the best of them. Unfortunately the songs just never seem capture the spirit of the band. </p><p>
<em>Fear of the Dark</em> (1990) and No Prayer for the Dying (1992) had some strong moments but far too much filler, and both suffered from going-through-the-motions syndrome. The four tracks featured here from those discs are just about all the casual fan needs. All four are strong, especially ""Be Quick or Be Dead"", one of the angriest songs in the band's history. And even though ""Bring Your Daughter...to the Slaughter"" has long been lampooned for its silliness, it's worth revisiting as a reminder that these guys aren't nearly as serious as their moody music would indicate. </p><p>
    From 1988's <em>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son</em>, we get ""The Clairvoyant"" and ""The Evil that Men Do."" This was Maiden at both their biggest and their most commercially accessible. The concept album featured tons of hooks and prominently featured synthesizers, and these two tracks showcase those traits magnificently, with ""The Clairvoyant"" containing this set's most triumphant melody. </p><p>
    Continuing backwards through their career, we arrive at <em>Somewhere in Time</em>, Maiden's first album to feature keyboards. ""Wasted Years"", where Dickinson worries that the his golden years are slipping by while he's trapped in a tour bus, begins with one of the most recognizable guitar leads in heavy metal. ""Heaven Can Wait"" is just as anthemic, forgoing the band's often gloomy imagery for an upbeat, positive message.</p><p>
    The band's first three albums to feature Bruce Dickinson were released in quick succession: Barely a year separated <em>Number of the Beast</em> and <em>Piece of Mind</em>. The band spent a large chunk of 1983 and 1984 on the road, then fired back with <em>Powerslave</em>. All three are powerhouses, and they are laced with many of the band's most well-known songs. By <em>Powerslave</em>, the line-up had finally solidified, and, and the benefits of this tightness were apparent. ""2 Minutes to Midnight"", ""Aces High"", ""Flight of Icarus"", ""The Trooper"", ""Number of the Beast"", and ""Run to the Hills"" are live staples to this day. This is Maiden at its strongest, its most confident, and its most adventurous. </p><p>
    From the band's earliest period we get ""Wrathchild"" and ""Killers"" from <em>Killers</em> and ""Phantom of the Opera"" from their self-titled debut. Paul Di'anno's raspy voice is a pretty stark contrast to Dickinson's, but these songs, and the albums they come from, show a younger band still trying to find its sound. ""Wrathchild"" and ""Killers"" both feature an infusion of punk attitude, and ""Phantom of the Opera"" is a an amateur attempt at prog-rock, featuring tons of time changes, odd vocal harmonies, and an instrumental breakdown in full of tinkling guitar and high-end bass. </p><p>
    The collection closes with two live tracks: ""Running Free"" from 1985's <em>Live After Death</em> and ""Iron Maiden"" from the forthcoming <em>Death on the Road</em>. The two tracks do well to bridge the old Iron Maiden with the new. The two songs were originally recorded over 25 years ago, and hearing these versions, themselves 20 years apart, back to back gives strong evidence that these guys are just as powerful today as when they first crawled their way out of East London almost three decades ago. </p></div>"|4166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4166-the-essential/|7.5|Cory D.

    songs directly pertaining to September 11th and what followed.
    ""Plymouth Rock"" tells the story about a soldier's first and possibly
    last sortie in Iraq, with the swooning and swirling music an impartial
    backdrop to this scene. ""Exodus Damage"" talks about a militiaman seeing
    the second plane hit, the narrator resigned to a fate beyond his control
    as a Radiohead-sanctioned mellotron chorus and various Middle Eastern
    drums circle around a repeated mocking call for ""dance dance
    revolution."" ""Trance Manual"" has an embedded journalist in Afghanistan
    seeking solace in the arms of a prostitute, and features the delicate chiming of
    church bells. ""Radiant With Terror"" tweaks a Robert Lowell poem about
    Cold War fears (""Fall 1961"") to address more clear and present dangers,
    and sets this paranoia to a tune that's a kissing cousin to Smashing
    Pumpkin's ""Disarm"".</p><p>
    
    And then there are the other songs on the album. Songs about losing a
    girlfriend's rabbit, a detective tracking another detective in a
    murder investigation, a groupie infatuated with a pop star, and
    behavior-modifying pharmaceuticals. Superficially, there seems to be no
    connection between this crop of songs and the more politically aware
    ones. The boyfriend losing the
    rabbit and the wounded soldier seemingly have nothing in common, until
    the boyfriend of ""Angela"" uses the rabbit's escape as an excuse to talk
    about getting the hell out of Burbank-- ""What do we have here anyway?/
    The abandoned warehouse scene.../ Synthesized, bullshit art dreams"".
    The detective in ""Continuation"" is caught in the same feedback loop as
    the gun-show goer in ""Exodus Damage"". And just as the journalist is
    looking to escape the noise and chaos of the war, the pop fan's looking
    for an oasis from the noise and chaos of his life. The verses of
    ""Peacocks in the Video Rain"" are cluttered with everyday debris and
    disjointed thoughts, but they give way to a simple four-word chorus,
    four words that are implied by the speaker in ""Trance Manual""-- ""I love
    you, too.""</p><p>
    
    Like Vanderslice's last album, <em>Pixel Revolt</em> features a store's
    worth of cool noise makers, used primarily by the singer and long-time
    collaborator Scott Solter. Meticulous arrangements abound, with the
    strings done by cellist Erik Friedlander, but everything is in it's
    right place. To the credit of Vanderslice and Solter, the orchestral
    clown-car smorgasborgs to be had in ""Trance Manual"" and ""Exodus Damage""
    sound just as unfussy as sparse tracks like ""Dead Pacific Slate"" and
    ""Farewell Transmission"". Some might wish this gift for fastidious
    arrangements would carry over to the lyrics, which feature a bevy of
    look-it-up references and descriptions that might stymie attempts at
    easy listening. It doesn't hurt to do a little research or, like, pay
    attention to lyrics worth a damn. (According to the liner notes, ""the
    lyrics of <em>Pixel Revolt</em> have been edited, expanded, and otherwise
    improved upon by John Darnielle"", so now you know the rest of the
    story.)</p><p>
    
    Appropriately, the one song that falls flat on this album-- ""CRC 7173,
    Affectionately""-- is as straight-forward as one could hope, both on the
    word and music tip. It's also boring as hell (think: really bad Maroon
    5), and ends the album on a sour note. Better, in my mind, to end with
    the solemn epiphany of ""Dead Slate Pacific""-- ""the only thing standing
    between/ Me and that long rope over a carpenter's beam/ Was you""-- and its gorgeous instrumental coda, ""The Golden Gate"". On
    an excellent album full of stories about running away and seeking safe
    haven, it would have been nice to end knowing someone found where they
    belong and, hopefully, made it through to the other side.</p></div>"|8405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8405-pixel-revolt/|8.3|David Raposa

Everything about it was gutsy. Warp had started three years earlier as a dance-oriented label that grew out of a DJ shop. Its founders had fallen in love with Detroit techno and set about releasing music that would further that tradition. But they noticed that in addition to dancing at clubs and raves, people were using electronic music in another way. The iconic cover illustration said it all: A robot, reclining in his living room, quite possibly stoned, with Kraftwerk and Pink Floyd LPs strewn about his floor. They envisioned a post-rave head session, a time for a contemplative and cerebral journey into music's future.</p>
<p>A bit hippie, isn't it? Warp didn't care. And they didn't just suggest these things with a title and images; they laid it all out explicitly on the record's cover. ""Artificial Intelligence is electronic listening music for long journeys, quiet nights and club drowsy dawns"" and ""Artificial Intelligence is the first in a series of 'listening albums' from Warp."" These statements now sound like they would be affixed to some sort of <i>Ultimate Chill</i> compilation sold at a coffee shop circa 1999, but this wasn't polite, head-nodding downtempo. Most of Artificial Intelligence was just a click or two away from the music that would have filled a dance floor. Tempos were a little slower and textures were more labored over but the LP was built on techno's sturdy foundation.</p>
<p>The idea was to retreat to a place removed from the utilitarian demands of the dance floor to engage in electronic music R&amp;D.; Everything about the package was presented as a paradigm shift, all the way down to the disarmingly earnest answers to standard questions (""Why did you contribute to A.I.""?) supplied by the artists on the inside sleeve. In sum, Warp said ""Here is something new and original, and you are going to be hearing a lot more if it,"" and then delivered on the promise. A genre was born, but Warp's ""Electronic Listening Music"" term never caught on. Instead, we got the much-reviled ""Intelligent Dance Music,"" named after the popular e-mail list of the same name.</p>
<p>With Warp going out on a limb to place itself at the forefront of ""progressive"" electronic music, revisiting both newly reissued volumes of <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> more than a decade later is in some ways problematic. You want to hear tracks as music first, but you can't help but listen to it as a historical document. I can say that nearly all of Volume I still sounds great. Richard D. James kicks things off as the Dice Man on ""Polygon Window"", and while his synths sound slightly crude by today's standards, the datedness is ultimately appealing, the weight of history adding substance in the same way as, say, heavy reverb does to countrypolitan. Autechre here is ridged and steeped in early futurist hip-hop; they contribute two great tracks including the astounding ""The Egg"", with its heavily chopped and rhythmically precise vocals. Naturally Dr. Alex Patterson brings the most archetypal ambient with the gauzy, sound-effects heavy ""Loving You Live"". I never particularly cared about Speedy J but the Dutch producer lightens the mood effectively with the bubbly and popish ""De-Orbit"" and then closes with the drifting ""Fill 3"".</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, the second volume doesn't hold up nearly as well. Oddly, while it has more variety it also seems more generic. By 1994 there were a lot of people making ""electronic listening music"" and this doesn't feel like a particularly special assemblage of what was out there. Canned breaks ruin Link's ""Arcadian"", while a recurring sample of a woman intoning ""Feel...strange..."" throughout Mark Franklin's ""Release to the System"", unlike the Richard D. James synth textures mentioned earlier, loses meaning when plucked from its rave-era context. Tracks by Richard Kirk and Higher Intelligence Agency are pleasant and engaging techno but not particularly memorable. The peak again comes from Autechre, whose ""Chatter"" finds them fusing half-speed Cybotron-style electro with languid acid textures, the soundtrack for breakdancing ecstasy in slow motion.</p>
<p>In the liner notes to the first volume, the Autechre boys then just 19 and 21, respond to the question ""Electronic Music. Where next?"" with an unintentionally prophetic answer. ""When people run dry copying each other, a deeper more creative music will occur where ideas and originality will play a central role.""

Everything about it was gutsy. Warp had started three years earlier as a dance-oriented label that grew out of a DJ shop. Its founders had fallen in love with Detroit techno and set about releasing music that would further that tradition. But they noticed that in addition to dancing at clubs and raves, people were using electronic music in another way. The iconic cover illustration said it all: A robot, reclining in his living room, quite possibly stoned, with Kraftwerk and Pink Floyd LPs strewn about his floor. They envisioned a post-rave head session, a time for a contemplative and cerebral journey into music's future.</p>
<p>A bit hippie, isn't it? Warp didn't care. And they didn't just suggest these things with a title and images; they laid it all out explicitly on the record's cover. ""Artificial Intelligence is electronic listening music for long journeys, quiet nights and club drowsy dawns"" and ""Artificial Intelligence is the first in a series of 'listening albums' from Warp."" These statements now sound like they would be affixed to some sort of <i>Ultimate Chill</i> compilation sold at a coffee shop circa 1999, but this wasn't polite, head-nodding downtempo. Most of Artificial Intelligence was just a click or two away from the music that would have filled a dance floor. Tempos were a little slower and textures were more labored over but the LP was built on techno's sturdy foundation.</p>
<p>The idea was to retreat to a place removed from the utilitarian demands of the dance floor to engage in electronic music R&amp;D.; Everything about the package was presented as a paradigm shift, all the way down to the disarmingly earnest answers to standard questions (""Why did you contribute to A.I.""?) supplied by the artists on the inside sleeve. In sum, Warp said ""Here is something new and original, and you are going to be hearing a lot more if it,"" and then delivered on the promise. A genre was born, but Warp's ""Electronic Listening Music"" term never caught on. Instead, we got the much-reviled ""Intelligent Dance Music,"" named after the popular e-mail list of the same name.</p>
<p>With Warp going out on a limb to place itself at the forefront of ""progressive"" electronic music, revisiting both newly reissued volumes of <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> more than a decade later is in some ways problematic. You want to hear tracks as music first, but you can't help but listen to it as a historical document. I can say that nearly all of Volume I still sounds great. Richard D. James kicks things off as the Dice Man on ""Polygon Window"", and while his synths sound slightly crude by today's standards, the datedness is ultimately appealing, the weight of history adding substance in the same way as, say, heavy reverb does to countrypolitan. Autechre here is ridged and steeped in early futurist hip-hop; they contribute two great tracks including the astounding ""The Egg"", with its heavily chopped and rhythmically precise vocals. Naturally Dr. Alex Patterson brings the most archetypal ambient with the gauzy, sound-effects heavy ""Loving You Live"". I never particularly cared about Speedy J but the Dutch producer lightens the mood effectively with the bubbly and popish ""De-Orbit"" and then closes with the drifting ""Fill 3"".</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, the second volume doesn't hold up nearly as well. Oddly, while it has more variety it also seems more generic. By 1994 there were a lot of people making ""electronic listening music"" and this doesn't feel like a particularly special assemblage of what was out there. Canned breaks ruin Link's ""Arcadian"", while a recurring sample of a woman intoning ""Feel...strange..."" throughout Mark Franklin's ""Release to the System"", unlike the Richard D. James synth textures mentioned earlier, loses meaning when plucked from its rave-era context. Tracks by Richard Kirk and Higher Intelligence Agency are pleasant and engaging techno but not particularly memorable. The peak again comes from Autechre, whose ""Chatter"" finds them fusing half-speed Cybotron-style electro with languid acid textures, the soundtrack for breakdancing ecstasy in slow motion.</p>
<p>In the liner notes to the first volume, the Autechre boys then just 19 and 21, respond to the question ""Electronic Music. Where next?"" with an unintentionally prophetic answer. ""When people run dry copying each other, a deeper more creative music will occur where ideas and originality will play a central role."" By now they are all too aware that the well of mimicry is essentially bottomless and there may not be as many original ideas as we once thought. Listening to the first <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> compilation is a reminder of how nice it must have been back in 1992 to dream such a thing.</p></div>"|11714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11714-artificial-intelligence-artificial-intelligence-ii/|6.8|Mark Richardson

Nevertheless, Foreign Born evoke all the familiar touchstones, stitching together Slowdive and the Stone Roses with newer benchmarks the Walkmen and Arcade Fire while carving their own niche alongside those artists.</p><p>
    
    Armed with bassist/producer and singer/composer tandem Lewis Pesacov and Matt Popieluch, these guys shrewdly cram every inch of the EP with lush keyboards and strings, complementing Popieluch's taut, reverb-soaked melodies. Yet Garrett Ray's aggressive drumming and driving tempos prevent this from being <em>Souvlaki, not to mention Popieluch's penchant for Bono-like theatrics. Opening track ""The Entryway"" shows off the group's repertoire, beginning with a gritty goth bassline flanked by spotless synths and ringing guitar. From the first uttered lyrics, Popieluch steadily crescendos, nearly blowing out his vocal chords before a guitar solo brings the song home.</em></p><p>
    
    The EP's middle tracks follow the precedent set by ex-Star Time behemoths the Walkmen. Standout ""It Grew on You"" cops the Walkmen's searing guitar strumming and cataclysmic drum fills while Popieluch haphazardly slurs his lyrics a la Hamilton Leithauser. He's no clone though, just Leithauser's spirit bottled up inside a deeper, smoother croon. Dragging its feet on listless chords, ""Exactly on the Verge"", though lacking in quirky, carnival playfulness, would fit nicely among <em>Bows + Arrows nostalgic ballads, ending dolefully on the phrase ""I was never so, so young.""</em></p><p>
    
    By the end of the record, the group runs low on ideas, and songs grow splotchy as a result. ""Exactly on the Verge"" both moves and drains as it structurally pales in comparison to its more complicated proceeding tracks. Closer ""Remote Woods"" starts with a primitive, fist-pumping riff pilfered from ""I Will Follow"", but a mediocre verse leads only to a deflated chorus, and the repeated intro riff serves solely to resuscitate the song midway through. At final count though, Foreign Born's tallies three shining nuggets and two intriguing yet fatigued tracks taken out of the oven too soon. It's a sterling debut from a well-bred band only one caffeine fix away from a solid, potent full-length.</p></div>"|3347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3347-in-the-remote-woods-ep/|7.6|Adam Moerder

Previous BOTH albums were collections of bedroom demos and older material; their first EP for Absolutely Kosher, <em>Holiday Machine</em> stays loyal to the 8-track. It's less diverse than <em>The Omaha Record</em>, and if you were a fan of 90s indie rock, it's probably nothing you haven't heard before-- some of Guided By Voices' scrappy production, a dash of Pavement's ennui, and some Archers of Loaf-brand scruff.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with its title track-- deep, detached vocals floating above swaying rhythms and chugging guitars, It's a pleasant stroll down ""120 Minutes"" lane, but things pick up with the second track, ""Riot Act"". Jangly guitars hold court over strummed power chords, pulled along by the double-tracked vocals of Simon on a simple, reaching melody. These songs are deceptively basic with a hint of melancholy.</p><p>
    
    Guided By Voices seems an apt comparison, with ""One of Us"" aiming for the same target as subdued GBV gems like ""My Valuable Hunting Knife"" or ""I Am a Scientist."" I'm not saying it's just as affecting, but BOTH wrench surprising gravity out of its few slow chords and simple hook, ""But you're not/ One of us."" The way Simon phrases it, cut between the ""not"" and ""one"" and sung in flat tone that doesn't pine or sneer, makes getting ostracized sound like inevitable fact, as commonplace as a high school gym line in order of ascending height.</p><p>
    
    The remaining tracks hew even closer to <i>Alien Lanes</i>-era GBV, particularly the roughshod electric drum beat under the jangle of ""Conjecture Measure"", or the thin power chords, strange accents, and non sequitur lyrics of the effortlessly catchy ""Candyman"". The melodies aren't as instantly memorable as ""Riot Act"" or ""One of Us"", but there's not a hint of filler, and more than half of the tracks have me hitting repeat before this brief EP ends. Tracing over the lines of classic slacker bands is an easy way to sound unaffected, yet I don't hear any ulterior motives in their nostalgia, just simple, self-assured songs from a band that never grew out of the 90s. Put it this way: Talent isn't flashing how much better you do something, it's making what you do better look easy.</p></div>"|1077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1077-holiday-machine-ep/|7.2|Jason Crock

Renouncing formulaic bombast, Bell Orchestre dazzles by finesse, not force. Call it blank slate music-- oceans of negative space awaiting colonization-by-imagination.</p>
<p>Bell Orchestre, led by the Arcade Fire's Richard Reed Parry, sparks memories of critically maligned early-decade instrumentalists Ghosts &amp; Vodka and Telegraph Melts-- bands derided, in part, for their lack of distortion. Bell Orchestre is more frictional than the former, less NPR-arty than the latter, but its general drift is similar. From the stertorous, semi-electronic horn swells of prelude ""Recording a Tunnel (the Horns Play Underneath the Canal)"", the album worms into focus. Less like rain than a slowly gathering fog, ""Les Lumieres Pt. 1"" builds from a murmur to a klaxon. To follow its development is to watch bacteria conquer a petri dish: New threads twist off somewhat chaotically from the brass nucleus-- an awakening string trill here, a gingerly bell flourish there.</p>
<p>On ""Les Lumieres Pt. 2"" the ecosystem hits full flower. Sultry, echoing horns chafe against skittish strings and fast, charging beats, a textural contrast reminiscent of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. (The bands, as <i>Recording</i> demonstrates, also share a penchant for ungainly titling.) But Bell Orchestre are on a much happier tip. Where Godspeed ride an abandoned train through a miserable wasteland, Bell Orchestre gallops across rich, rustic landscapes. Like Lumen or Explosions in the Sky, it's all a bit fantastical, but the band goes easy on the symbolistic dalliances. Bell Orchestre is all about freeing our neural pathways, not directing them.</p>
<p>And hey, here's an idea: concision. Five of <i>Recording's</i> 11 tracks undershoot four minutes. Despite a couple of longer, jammier pieces the album is a still a breezy listen. That's because, unlike lost siblings Do Make Say Think, Bell Orchestre largely avoids ambient pussyfooting. Voluminosity and slenderness rarely cohabitate in instrumental post-rock, but here both are integral. Nuggets ""Recording a Tunnel"" and the chilly ""The Bells Play the Band"", which imagines Boards of Canada piped through ham radio, would become boundless gorges of nothingness in the hands of many similar bands; Bell Orchestre wisely consigns its most shapeless passages to short stopgaps and segues. Meanwhile, instrumentally verbose songs like ""Throw It on a Fire"" are kept asteer by bedrock percussion.</p>
<p>Recording is designed to underwhelm. It rewards repeat listens and nurtures those lulled by its intoxicating spumes. Whether the album achieves its titular synesthesia is debatable, but Bell Orchestre tap into a wide, mesmerizing range of the spectrum.</p></div>"|1174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1174-recording-a-tape-the-colour-of-the-light/|7.8|Sam Ubl

    that he likes the indie rock. Now the indie rock's liking him back:
    Absolutely Kosher's seen fit to release his band Get Him Eat Him's
    full-length debut. Tuneful, guitar-driven rock? Check. Earnest, reedy
    vocals? Check. Sloppy playing and slacker vibes? Ch- actually, no,
    uncheck. Get Him Eat Him largely forgoes the happy (or apathetic)
    accident and the facile discordant smear, trafficking in deeply
    layered guitar lines you need a map to follow, processed vocals, and
    intricately sculpted melodies. Like all good indie rock, it vortexes a
    bundle of touchstones into a nervous, jittery coil-- you can hear
    proggy Built to Spillisms jostling against the hyper jangle of the
    Wrens, and a virtuosic Ted Leo shouting ""power-pop!"" to a snotty Elvis
    Costello's ""new wave!""</p><p>
    
    The geography cone is a snail armed with a fatal nerve toxin (thanks,
    Google!) that the National Institute of General Medical Sciences
    equates with ""eating a lethal dose of badly prepared Japanese puffer
    fish while a cobra is biting you."" Get Him Eat Him was shrewd in
    taking its name for their album-- these songs are sheer nervy
    overload, biting and stinging from every direction. ""The Celebration""
    opens abruptly in mid guitar rumble, as if the eager band had been
    playing it for eons, just waiting for someone to roll tape. ""One Word""
    is a standout, with a gliding lead and swift counterpoint staggering
    into an anthemic, off-kilter swagger, the music swinging in and out of
    phase with the catchy vocal line and its ""haircuts and halos."" The
    harmonizer effect LeMay often uses on his vocals sweetens up the
    squealing, staccato ""Pardon My French"", and imbues the
    already-overdriven ""Bad Thoughts"" with even more evil robot power. The
    pageantry is so non-stop that the plosive, almost IDM-ish serenity of
    ""Interlude"" is doubly pleasing, as are the pastoral jangles,
    frictionless bass balloons, and lyrical keyboards of ""Early Scarlet
    Globes"". In fact, I'd like to hear more from Get Him Eat Him in this
    more pensive, less busy range.</p><p>
    
    Jay Pellici's recording amplifies every spasm of pent-up energy
    roiling in these songs, and the young band's enthusiasm (LeMay is the
    oldest at, what, 21? 22?) is palpable, electric. A flurry of ideas and
    passions so hotly burning that they have to be captured <em>right
    now</em> vie for space, occasionally weighing the record down, but
    usually flogging it toward whatever blurry finish line college kids
    are chasing these days. I don't know; I'm aging out of the
    demographic. Smells like fumbling sex and drunken dance parties to me,
    the burnt-ozone aroma of youthful urgency at odds with the
    preternaturally deft, confident musicianship. </p></div>"|3680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3680-geography-cones/|7.4|Brian Howe

Little were we to realize, then, that the group has in fact been holding out on us, as evidenced by their substantial new double-album <em>Pine Cone Temples</em>. Assembled from previously unreleased tracks recorded between 1999-2004, this collection again finds Thuja returning to their always captivating (if increasingly familiar) studies in pure environmental immersion and improvised, keenly observant micro-folk.</p><p>
    
    Performed, as always, by Jewelled Antler linchpins Loren Chasse (also of the Blithe Sons &amp; Id Battery, among others), Steven R. Smith (solo, Hala Strana), Rob Reger (Franciscan Hobbies), and Glenn Donaldson (Skygreen Leopards, Blithe Sons, etc.), <em>Pine Cone Temples</em> differs from its predecessors most notably in terms of scope. Where earlier albums like Ghost Plants and Suns consisted predominantly of shorter pieces of widely varying tones and textures, here Thuja works almost exclusively on larger scale compositions, with most of these eight untitled tracks extending beyond the 10-minute mark as the group patiently allow their meticulous, spontaneous music to spread vine-like beneath the forest canopies, quietly chewing vast expanses of scenery with their soft mandibles.</p><p>
    
    As with their previous works, Thuja have recorded these pieces in a variety of natural settings, using strategically placed contact mics to help integrate the tiniest audible details of their ambient surroundings into the group's gentle commotion. Theirs is a uniquely intuitive, egoless species of improvisation, as the musicians seem to be competing not for the listener's attention, but to see who can most thoroughly camouflage himself in the underbrush. Though the quartet implements such conventional ingredients as guitar, piano, and hammered or bowed strings, the album contains few unaltered or immediately recognizable sounds, particularly since each musician seems determined to disguise his instrument as a conch shell or an acorn.</p><p>
    
    The first disc of <em>Pine Cone Temples</em> opens with the brief, jarring sound of a needle scratching across vinyl, before Thuja unhurriedly settle into their first extended creation, an effervescent mosaic of rustling percussion, deep earthy drones, and twinkling lights. From then on, the events spread over the course of these two discs seldom achieve anything beyond the volume of a fallen branch crashing to earth, as the group variously content themselves with gradually building swells of transistor rubble, amp feedback, and imprecisely Eastern-sounding acoustic strings. A notable exception occurs late in the second disc's epic 26-minute finale, a piece that climbs from its tranquil intro of what sounds like a campfire dispassionately consuming manzanita to an apex of electrified noise as starkly dissonant as anything the group have ever cut.</p><p>
    
    With its ambitious dimensions and the uncertain chronology of its compiled recordings, <em>Pine Cone Temples</em> seems an especially diffuse addition to Thuja's discography, one whose primary appeal will be to those already familiar with the group's organic methods and contours, while newcomers are wisely directed to start with the more easily-digested likes of Ghost Plants. And as with any cross-sectional collection like this, one can't help but wonder if Thuja isn't sitting on a virtually bottomless pile of such recordings, full of tapes that could equal or better anything included here.</p></div>"|8053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8053-pine-cone-temples/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

No
    Philly-style ""Next Borough"" <em>New York Times</em> puff pieces, either.
    Why, I'll bet you didn't even realize that the home of many major
    credit-card issuers is the birthplace of Tom Verlaine <em>and</em>
    to-the-bone bad-ass George Thorogood. On aptly named Bar/None debut
    <em>Nice and Nicely Done</em>, local sextet the Spinto Band takes
    advantage of its hometown's invisible indie profile to sprawl all
    across the map of twitchy, 64-crayon guitar-pop.</p><p>
    
    To start, the Spinto Band's two lead singers traverse enough styles
    for a week's worth of positive Pitchfork notices. Nick Krill does the
    wobbly David Byrne warble about as well as deservedly lauded Clap Your
    Hands Say ""It Boy"" Alec Ounsworth. See harpsichord-splashed breakup
    song ""Did I Tell You"" and Turtles-quoting synth-pop come-on ""Spy Vs.
    Spy"". But Krill can also do dead-on <em>Brighten the Corners</em>-era
    Steve-O Malkmus (""Late"", which brightly details the everyday dangers
    of rushing home for a favorite show: ""It's slippery by the pool"").
    Meanwhile, fellow songwriter Thomas Hughes covers the sotto-voce
    sensitive-guy territory. His kazoo-enhanced ""Brown Boxes"" zooms in on
    a move-out/breakup: packing a pointless Hummel figurine while
    half-wishing for box-cutters sharp enough to ""end it all"". As
    throughout the album, a buoyant chorus saves the day.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, the group's college-age members rarely fail to build on their
    obvious indie influences with swooning California melodies and quirky
    instrumentation. Of particular note is Krill's ""Oh Mandy"", a ringing
    anthem of unrequited love, lush with mandolins and theremin. It
    namedrops the WB-- hey, ""Dawson's Creek"" was filmed in Wilmington...N.C.-- but is probably perfect for ""The O.C."" (that's meant as a
    compliment, guys). Another standout is ""Trust Vs. Mistrust"", which
    rides glockenspiel and a catchy ""ah-ooh, ah-ooh"" hook into another
    Pavement-esque verse about young, well-mannered lust.
    Four-on-the-floor ""Crack the Whip"" lashes the make-up alternapop
    zeitgeist, whippin' the Killers at their own neu-dance-wave game
    before ascending to a gates-of-heaven Beach Boys chorus like this was
    the Biblical, non-DFA Rapture.</p><p>
    
    Yeah, so the occasionally adolescent lyrics admit the Spinto Band's youth and
    the last couple of tracks trail off a bit, but the group's spirit of
    pop adventurism suggests it's worthy of early comparisons to gifted
    labelmate Architecture in Helsinki. Extra kudos are in order for goofy
    bonus track ""Japan Is an Island"": Amid Atari bleeping, Wilmington's
    finest will take you to a land where ""Cornelius is a pop star,"" but
    they won't take American Express. Actually, they probably will.</p></div>"|7829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7829-nice-and-nicely-done/|7.3|Marc Hogan

Their debut, <em>Holes in the Valley</em>, conjures visions of some lost pocket of '60s social idealism, a wigwam village where men cultivate immense beards and women nurse infants in slings and everyone gathers around the campfire for early-evening sing-alongs. This is, of course, both a compliment and a criticism. The band is obviously aiming for a throwback sound (which makes the chorus ""These are the times we live in"" seem particularly disingenuous), and the flower-power-era folk on <em>Holes in the Valley</em> alternates between kum-ba-ya intimacy of ""Heart Attack Romance"" and jangly pop like ""We Dance Everyday"", all with a sporadically brooding mood and dark lyrics that address complicated, but not necessarily free, love.</p><p>
    Despite reports that Luke Steele is a control freak with his day-job band the Sleepy Jackson, the communal aspect of Nations by the River's sound creeps into the band's make-up: Steele, Gelbison's Edo Kahn and Dove Kahn, and Old Man River's Ohad Rein all share the songwriting responsibilities and alternate vocal duties, and it's not unimaginable-- hell, it's more than likely-- that they even share the less desirable tasks, like driving the tour van or playing bass. However, like any utopian experiment, <em>Holes in the Valley</em> gets very dull very quickly. Their devotion to re-creating a particular sound gives the album an air of deadly self-seriousness and precludes any real experimentation or fun. What else is a side-project good for if not that?</p><p>
    A few flashes of ingenuity interrupt the otherwise mundane songs. For the album's most remarkable moment, ""The Prettiest Girl"" starts off like every other song on the album-- gentle acoustic strums, sensitive vocals-- but then what sounds like a summer-stock chorale sings a lengthy showtune segmentÉ in Hebrew. ""Heroin"" at least tries for moody atmosphere, although any song by that title that's not a Velvet Underground cover is pretty much doomed. Steele adds some weirdness in places, his prickly voice sounding even more otherworldly in this earthy context: ""Kids World"" is sleepy Sleepy Jackson, but ""Boys"" features his eerie falsetto leading into a hypnotic chorus.</p><p>
    Nevertheless, <em>Holes in the Valley</em> is full of holes itself: song ideas that sound like they're still incubating. The opener ""I Don't Want You"" ends abruptly after only one verse and chorus. Most of the songs are built on repetition of simple passages, and a few, like ""Cracking Up"", hum their melodies where lyrics are conspicuously absent. The effect is to suggest something impromptu and fleeting, temporary instead of stable. Apparently, all things must pass. So maybe Nations by the River isn't a committed commune, but just summer camp.</p></div>"|5918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5918-holes-in-the-valley/|5.4|Stephen M. Deusner

So frontman Gruff Rhys's pre-SFA
    band name Ffa Coffi Pawb can mean either ""Everybody's Coffee Beans"" or
    ""Fuck Off, Everybody."" So 2003's ""Venus &amp; Serena"" refers to the tennis
    sisters and/or two pet turtles beloved of a boy raised by wolves
    (sure, why not?). The recordings are pop, psychedelic, IDM, punk,
    funk, folk, soul, classical-- often all at once. ""Citizens Band"", a
    hidden track from the band's 1999 album <em>Guerrilla</em> required
    a liner-note glossary to decode its playful lyrics, as Rhys sang: ""So
    many ways to communicate what you want to say.""</p><p>
<em>Love Kraft</em>, then, the Welsh quintet's seventh album in 12
    years, may be an homage to the bands Love and Kraftwerk. It may signal
    the band's love for its craft, or acknowledge the eternal
    sense/sensibility, passion/prose, <em>Speakerboxx</em>/<em>The Love
    Below</em> dichotomy. Is it an expression of affinity for ""master of
    the macabre"" H.P. Lovecraft, whose novels sometimes took place in an
    SFA-OK ""Dreamlands"" setting and are familiar to <em>Re-Animator</em>
    fans? If you believe Rhys' press clippings, it's either a sex shop in
    Cardiff, Wales, or a ""hovering vehicle""-- a fitting
    replacement for the band's <i>Radiator</i>-era ""peace tank."" Heck, maybe Rhys just really digs cheese.</p><p>
    Whatever its etymology, <em>Love Kraft</em> is a utopian epic, a
    sweeping musical argument for love in the time of
    Fallujah. In that sense, it's vintage SFA, with even its departures
    underscoring the band's long-established strengths. The leftist politics
    are less overt, but just as potent; the compositions more focused, but
    still mad as a Lewis Carroll hatter; the pop more rockin', yet
    probably more accessible to noobs. The splash that begins the album is
    at once a baptism and an immersion, and the band doesn't come up for air until High Llama Sean O'Hagan's final
    flitting string arrangement.</p><p>
    Politically, fury has given way to fantasy. Gone are direct
    polemics like antiwar parable ""The Piccolo Snare"" or Bush-burner ""Out
    of Control"", both from 2003's <em>Phantom Power</em>. With the world ""slipping away""-- ""Kiss me with
    apocalypse,"" Rhys mourns on opener ""Zoom!""-- the Furries throw up their hands and invent a new one, full of dinosaurs, chickens, horsenappings, unwanted pregnancies, and, yes, love. The
    intergalactic Prince workout of lead single ""Lazer Beam"" proposes ""no more romantic
    comedies"" (take notes, Dems!) and a weapon to wash away evil-- as
    practical, when you think about it, as convincing certain voters they
    were misled into a downward-spiraling war. On ""Frequency"", Rhys'
    target is clear (""You say history will be your judge/ But the jury's
    whipped, gagged, and drugged""), but a sumptuous ""Turning Tide""-style
    hook dilutes the venom. The songs are at once lovely and full of
    impotent dread; if you can't beat 'em, they seem to decide, beautify.</p><p>
    For the first time, four of the
    band's five members sing and contribute songs-- including keyboardist
    Cian Ciárán, ostensibly the force behind the band's past trackier,
    IDM-influenced efforts-- and together they grasp the narrative arcs
    that sometimes have eluded Rhys. The
    tripartite ""Cloudberries"", with its ""Took a circle of friends to the
    village square/ Oh, love triangles"" and samba-like midsection, ranks
    among the band's finest. Ciárán's ""Walk You Home"" starts as shy,
    string-laden Avalanches lounge before swelling into a delicate payoff.
    Drummer Dafydd Ieuan's ""Atomik Lust"" leads languid ""Feel Flows""
    keyboards unwittingly into a radioactive wall of guitars; ""I'd love to
    see the ending someday of <em>Citizen Kane</em>,"" Ieuan sighs. Guitarist
    Huw ""Bunf"" Bunford's Wings-esque road tune ""Back on a Roll"" is the
    lone disappointment.</p><p>
    ""Lazer Beam"" aside, the guitar-heavy <em>Love Kraft</em> may be the
    Furries' most straightforward ""rock"" album. Even as ""Psyclone!"" riffs on space invaders and
    tyrannosaurs, it boasts the most enormous na-na-na-na chorus this
    year-- Beck's ""E-Pro"" swathed in Moroccan samples and brazen strings.
    ""Ohio Heat"" steps from <em>Phantom Power</em>'s Byrdsian twang to an
    America-esque trot, with harmonies and acoustic guitars spooning sugar
    onto lyrics involving a fictitious Welsh emigrant's 19th-century
    Midwestern suicide. Bunf's ""The Horn"" must be among the catchiest
    songs ever to prominently feature the dulcimer.</p><p>
    Even beyond the album title, everything Super Furry means more than it
    seems. ""Atomik Lust"" is apparently about Ieuan's fear of flying as
    well as ""if-it's-not-love-then-it's-the-bomb"" apocalyptic romance--
    complete with ""turbulence"" sound effects. Jurassic, galactic goof
    ""Psyclone!"" can also be about Creationism, re-branded
    these days as ""intelligent design."" ""Zoom!"" was originally performed
    in a 2001 Peel session with inscrutable nonsense lyrics
    instead of its current ashen-faced wordplay.</p><p>
    On ""Walk You Home"", Ciárán sings, ""The future ain't what it used to
    be."" The line has been attributed to Yogi Berra, French symbolist poet
    Paul Valery, and Arthur C. Clarke. At its essence, <em>Love Kraft</em>
    is an assertion that the future-- and the present-- don't need to be
    that way at all; indeed, they can be however we imagine them. On
    album-closing ""Cabin Fever"", a piano comedown worthy of Dennis
    Wilson's overlooked <em>Pacific Ocean Blue</em>, Ciárán gets the last
    word, so refreshed, so clean: ""The future now is wide open and clear.""
    Anything's possible.</p></div>"|7605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7605-love-kraft/|8.5|Marc Hogan

    and digital processing-- I don't know why it took me so long to realize this,
    but <i><em>Shaggy Black</em></i> is clearly a jazz record.</p><p>
    
    Here/there Dino Felipe and Nick Forte may come off a Black Dice cover band
    (""Gnome On the Noggin""), or Fennesz worshippers with mostly good intentions
    (""One Needle Per Village""), or a chopped-and-screwed version of Hair Police
    (""Hoof Lager or Horse Pills""). But when it comes down to it, F+F swing harder
    than all them-- shit, they swing period. Jazz (but not free jazz) purists in
    the indie rock midst, the kind who approach things from an ""Is this jazz?""
    perspective like they teach you at college radio: Check the processed vocal
    riff on ""Pick Yer Poison"", which sounds like Louis Armstrong trying to drown
    himself in a bathtub. Yep, he just doesn't have the heart to go through with
    it.</p><p>
    
    Hey: Maybe jazz greats unsuccessfully committing suicide isn't what <i>Shaggy
    Black</i> is really about. Maybe this is a disco record. Maybe that's why the
    buzzy pitter-patter of ""Anteater"" sounds like the Bee Gees being electrocuted
    by the state for serial murder. Maybe that's why ""Violent Flag"" has such a
    violent, tribal call-to-war vibe, a most poetically roundabout paean to ""Disco
    Duck"", whose radio jock composer Rick Dees is still living, I repeat, <em>still
    living</em>.</p><p>
    
    The blanks are yours to madlib, and you might as well: My gripe with
    <i>Shaggy</i> at first was never a paucity of syntax or front-end beauty (this record is gorgeous), just no context. But the flip of context-lack is
    complete malleability, and really, this record's refusal of one proper
    ""carefully considered processed noise"" read might be the only
    reason worth giving a shit about it. I see trees of green, you see skies of

Less tenable in a Seattle retro-rock quartet than, say, a 6'4"" prep school pitcher with a great fastball, potential causes both critics and fans to recklessly affix phrases ""shows promise"" and ""nice raw instincts"" to lackluster debuts, hoping these consolation prizes will come to fruition or at least become self-fulfilling prophecies. For Seattle quintet Minus the Bear, the potential on 2001's <em>This Is What I Know About Being Gigantic EP has been the sole sustenance in a career marked by unfledged EPs and a fallow full-length. While </em><em>Menos el Oso falls short of watershed magnitude, the album showcases Minus the Bear's spaz-prog mishmash subtly solidifying into something potent.</em></p><p>
    
    Minus the Bear's instrumental prowess has always been a double-edged sword: Although their signature jittery riffs and hyperactive song structures initially reel listeners in, singer Jake Snider can't hold a candle to his bandmates, forcing them to sacrifice complex compositions for Jimmy Eat World-style power-pop choruses. However, Snider and his mates strike a compromise on <em>Menos el Oso, allowing the instruments to carry an increased share of the melody while the singer's dry vocals take a backseat.</em></p><p>
    
    Opener (and possible west-coast shout-out) ""The Game Needed Me"" deploys jerky percussion, vulcanized bass, and spring-loaded guitar swells to complement Snider's smooth, detached Pedro the Lion imitation. The reduced airtime makes room for more rhythmic and technical noodling, and on ""Memphis and 53rd"", this conservative vocals approach produces one of the band's most commendable, and downright pretty, mid-tempo efforts. The song opens with a reverb-heavy riff reminiscent of Sunny Day Real Estate, building steadily towards a jazzy albeit anxiety-ridden chorus until Snider wisely heeds to the best riff on the album-- a spacey, lithe little maneuver that makes the album's finger-spraining licks seem even more gratuitous.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, there just aren't enough interesting ideas here to conceal Snider's limitations. ""The Fix"" and ""Fulfill the Dream"" each storm out the gate like Q and Not U rockers, but the vocals drag behind, eventually necessitating a masturbatory guitar solo to finish off both tracks. <em>Menos el Oso ultimately stumbles on its own self-conscious maturity. Yes, the outlandishly long song titles and sophomoric lyrics have mostly vanished, but ""El Torrente"" and ""The Pig War"" don't need to take cues from sopor-groups Karate or Death Cab for Cutie. Still, whether or not Minus the Bear ever fulfill their once prodigious expectations is irrelevant at this point. They ain't exactly blue chip prospects anymore, but I can settle for a solid, developed role player.</em></p></div>"|5326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5326-menos-el-oso/|7.1|Adam Moerder

But its song, ""Angel's Share"", was summarily blown from ken by Joanna Newsom's ""Bridges and Balloons""-- by many accounts the national anthem of freak-folk. On the LP front, the quartet came up short, too: Its eponymous debut trumped products from Cocorosie, White Magic, and Josephine Foster, but lost publicity to critical darlings Espers and Iron &amp; Wine. Having Banhart on guitar wasn't the boon you'd expect either: Judging by reactions to late-year solo bid </em><em>Nino Rojo, the gangly dynamo couldn't escape the shadow of his own </em><em>Rejoicing in the Hands</em>, much less curry favor for Andy Cabic and co.</p><p>
    
    A year later, the freak-folk radicals are trying a softened stance. Six Organs' <em>School of the Flower</em>, a spindly psych jamboree, may cling with both hands to weird '04, but forthcoming releases from Banhart and Animal Collective come lathered and rinsed. <em>Between finds Vetiver, once conservative by comparison, in perfect consonance with the gang-- and the band hardly had to change a thing.</em></p><p>
    
    Brevity is <em>Between's greatest asset: With no standout tracks, the five-song EP is best swallowed whole for a quick, mild sedative. Cabic's elegiac vox are also a strong selling point; they sound pressed on to the mix, flushed with a ferric patina. But Cabic needs an assertive hook to step up to meet him. Instead, his backup-- mainly an acoustic guitar and quiet percussion-- pitter-patters along, serviceable but indifferent.</em></p><p>
    
    Fat with reverbed guitars and wafting fiddle, ""Belles"" has by far the richest instrumental backdrop. Don't expect variegation, but it sure is pleasant. ""Been So Long"" dips into Wonder Years schmaltz and comes up with the album's sweetest vocal hook, while ""Save Me a Place"" is all starry campfire strum. ""Busted (Brokedown Version)"" takes it a step further, imagining the curdling marshmallow on a stick. It's almost atavistic-- those warped, sylvan coos sound so 2004.</p><p>
    
    So here Vetiver releases this satisfactory summer holdover while freak-folk takes a well-deserved snooze. When it awakes, it's Banhart, AC, and Cocorosie with new albums, on which hang more-or-less Sisyphean expectations. Maybe that'll clear the air for Vetiver's next LP, and it'll be Andy Cabic's turn to shine.</p></div>"|8529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8529-between-ep/|6.4|Sam Ubl

Furthermore, considering their miniscule front-to-back odds, all double albums should be steamrolled at once. Think about it: When the Olympics sweep through every couple years, everyone gets amped for the 100-meter sprint while longer foot races inevitably devolve into mind-numbing NASCAR-like tedium-fests. Though there may be some kind of impotent hand-me-down stigma associated with such shorter musical statements-- ""It's good...but, I mean, it's only an EP""-- it's about time those disgusting discriminations changed. The Mobius Band, for one, would benefit from such a less-is-more mentality. Following four increasingly focused EPs that saw the band go from quaint instrumental post-rock to this year's blip-rocking hybrid <em>City vs Country</em>, the Brooklyn-based trio disappoints here by retracing the alienated posture of their previous release while rarely reaching its respectable heights.</p><p>
    
    Predictably, the first thing to wear is frontman Ben Sterling's monotone musings. Whether his pulse simply sustains at an abnormally low level or he's putting us on with his reedy, Ben Stein-type delivery (sans dead-pan wit, game-show acumen, and conservative agenda), the affectless style is limiting. The vocals become even more troublesome when coupled with some of the record's offensively inane lyrics-- hipster-histrionics can only get you so far, guys. On <em>City vs Country</em>, the band's words were harmlessly and somewhat mysteriously vague, but here the content dips into rote Bushy bitching on modern-day corruption with ""Twilight"" (""I will teach my children to lie/ They will know what's wrong will be right""), rote indie vs. mainstream bitching on ""Radio Coup"" (""Publicists tell you what to think/ They do a good job""-- of course, the Mobius Band are hardly flack free), and inexcusable-- and rote-- repetitiveness on ""Philadelphia"" (""Ain't it funny how times can change/ Arrangements re-arrange""). The trio's words are remnicent of enduring heartthrob-misfit Jordan Catalano's uncanny appeal-- they're more believably brooding and tortured when expressed in detatched generalities rather than forced specifics.</p><p>
    
    And instead of glossing over such uninspired wordplay with their dynamic newfound studio polish (Interpol associate Peter Katis helped produce the album), the mistakes are highlighted by an overdose of tepid electro-zzzz ballads. Revamped oldie ""Taxicab"" lasts nearly six minutes and is punctuated by a relatively raucous finale, but the bulk of the song is about as riveting as its drawn-out hook: ""Taxicab, taxicab, middle of winter."" Another patience-tester is ""Philadelphia"", which is drowned in an atmospheric listlessness that only accentuates the obvious undercooking.</p><p>
<em>Static</em> isn't a total between-stations affair. On the strength of an enticing synth line, ""Doo Wop"" is the closest this band may ever get to quirky, hip-shaking. The half-man, half-machine blues of ""You're Wrong"" recalls Radiohead's ""I Might Be Wrong"" as it gives us a glimpse of what the Mobius Band's high expectations could have wrought with more structural massaging. And the perfectionist production is exquisite and exhausting in its attention to detail and nimble attempts at combining typical guitar jangle with zippy, bionic beats. There's a decent EP buried within the album's 10 songs but, as a whole, <em>Static</em> doesn't have the stamina to uphold its over-extended play.</p></div>"|5343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5343-the-loving-sound-of-static/|5.8|Ryan Dombal

    friend who was a freshman at the university in my town. So on weekends
    Dave and I used to go to this guy's dorm and see if we could blend in at
    parties, trying to meet college girls by pretending we were college
    guys. If it sounds like we were operators, bear in mind that neither of
    us had ever been on a date. I'm pretty sure I'd never so much as held a
    girl's hand. I think we had the courage to try because the chance of
    success seemed so remote. There was also the beer.</p><p>
    
    One weekend at some party we wound up talking to two girls who seemed to
    find us amusing. I'm not sure if I understood then the distinction
    between ""laughing at"" and ""laughing with,"" but the important thing was
    they were standing there near us, chuckling once in a while. Eventually
    they asked if we'd like to go back to their room to hang out. What a
    question! They were on the other side of the elevators and we followed
    them down and filed in and sat on the floor as one of them went to the
    stereo to put on a record. She handed me the album cover and it looked
    strange, an antiquated photograph of a young girl on a creaky porch
    peering into a window, presumably at something forbidden.</p><p>
    
    My recall of hearing the record is fuzzy but I remember the reaction of
    our hosts. This music transformed them completely. They became unhinged,
    shouting lyrics to each other and dancing across the floor as we sat
    motionless and confused. It was, frankly, terrifying. I felt completely
    unmoored, awkwardly wondering what to do in the face of such extreme
    behavior. It quickly became clear to us that we were extraneous, that
    the only reason we all went back to their room was so they could put on
    this one particular record. We were in way over our heads. Around the
    third or fourth song we mumbled something about having to go and slipped
    out, embarrassed and confused, without so much as a wave goodbye. What
    was this music that inspired such ecstasy?</p><p>
    
    Violent Femmes, of course, the self-titled debut, with lead singer
    Gordon Gano as the creepy but strangely alluring backdoor man. Gano was
    Jonathan Richman with an unsteady moral compass, sharing Jo Jo's love of
    the Velvet Underground, 1950s rockabilly, and romanticized teenage life,
    but instead of looking for someone to care about his eyes were drawn to
    your pants. The instantly catchy tunes and clever songs were fused with
    an original and complimentary production, a bare-bones acoustic
    minimalism, all played on 10 steel strings and a single snare drum. It
    was one the finest debuts of the 80s, eventually going platinum and
    developing a long life in fraternity houses and on the stands of college
    pep bands, well outside of what would seem its natural habitat.</p><p>
<em>Violent Femmes</em> was such a perfect expression of geeky teenage
    angst and lust that there was no way to follow it, and the band never
    really tried. They soon after released <em>Hallowed Ground</em>, a very good
    album with a markedly different focus, but failed to build any real
    momentum through the rest 80s. Albums still come out every three years
    or so and Violent Femmes is still a tour draw with a cult of fans, but
    no other album has had near the impact of the debut.</p><p>
<em>Permanent Record</em> is the band's third best-of since 1991. This
    definitely beats the 1993 compilation <em>Add It Up</em> for both consistency and
    track selection, although both inexplicably omit ""Prove My Love"". That's
    the problem with a hits comp from a band known mostly for one album: you
    can only repeat so many songs from the catalog's biggest seller. Six of
    the 17 songs here are from the debut, including a live version of ""Good
    Feeling"" as a bonus track. All of these, of course, are great.</p><p>
    
    From <em>Hallowed Ground</em>, ""Black Girls"" is still fun, with Gano's sharpest
    sneer and a sax solo by John Zorn to match. ""Jesus Walking on the Water""
    and ""Country Death Song"" (unfortunately a live version) reflect Gano's
    upbringing as the son of a Baptist minister who obviously listened to a
    whole bunch of Hank Sr. ""American Music"" presents a kinder and gentler
    Violent Femmes, too many drugs and home alone on the night of the prom
    but with a quintessential melody and chords to keep the outlook shiny
    and the appeal universal. Beyond these songs there's a marked dip in
    quality, a few OK songs but ultimately too many lackluster melodies
    swaddled in generic rock production. Still, they've earned the right to
    keep going, and they had a moment most bands would kill for. All those
    happy shouts from drunken kids add up to a lot.</p></div>"|8543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8543-permanent-record-the-very-best-of-violent-femmes/|7.5|Mark Richardson

    excess, perhaps it's working a little too well. Over the course of the band's
    elegant avant-pop debut, it subjugates effect to ambition, inflating
    concise pop sound-bites to epic proportions (10 songs in a daunting
    72 minutes). Sitting at the digi-pastoral nexus of Scott
    Walker's overstated vocals, the Flaming Lips' neon popscapes, Brian
    Eno's ambient experiments, and Neutral Milk Hotel's found-sound
    dalliance, FTW engages in much repetition that seems unnecessary-- many of these ideas could have been winningly discharged in half the
    time. Instead, they intricately bloat and dawdle, and you might feel
    ""over"" a song before it breathes its admittedly gorgeous last.</p><p>
    
    In its first minute alone, ""Happy 13"" gathers up sloshing water
    samples, wheezy electronics evoking everything from keyboards to
    bagpipes, crashing drums, acoustic strumming, and a request to ""please
    leave all shiny objects behind."" Gradually adding spectral harmonies
    and twinkling detuned piano to this mind-cramming dream travelogue, it
    shuffles through dizzying permutations. ""Popstar Researching
    Oblivion"" introduces some common FTW motifs: Chuffing, vaguely martial
    percussion; wavering organ gasps; ripe, elegiac brass; spangled sheets
    of reverb; and angelic choruses intoning fat, fallow syllables. The
    multitude of instrumental parts is so similarly colored and
    oft-repeated that it sometimes blurs into obscurity, but the band can
    also be glorious in this state of resonant disarticulation. When Paul
    Carter hunkers down to tell stories, it's less interesting.</p><p>
    
    Musical standouts ""Donald Pleasance"" and ""Losing Carolina; For Drusky""
    broaden the sonic palette further, with trad-indie guitar arpeggios
    contorting though starry expanses of limpid strings and icy chimelets.
    Lyrically, the former revolves around Carter's steadfast, suitably
    despondent eulogy at the funeral of ""our love."" It's a great concept,
    but as on many of the tracks, the band's sonic accouterments prove
    more moving than the vague libretto. In the latter, a nightingale song
    flits around the fairly incomprehensible tale of Drusky, who wanted
    ""God to return his youth"" while ""resurrecting his mother and his pet
    pigeon."" </p><p>
    
    The most memorable track might also be the shortest and simplest,
    ""Happiness Is on the Outside"", which finds Carter casting distant
    ""hellos"" into an amorphous blizzard of melodic interference. Beating
    within the chilly precipitation of his a.m.-wire salutation is
    Carter's most pressing query (even if he sometimes asks it
    indirectly): ""Can you tell me why you left me here all on my own?"" At
    song's end he promises, almost threatens, to eventually open the page
    of his diary that rejoices in solitude, and relates ""how [he] took
    your throne as the meanest bastard in the all Albuquerque."" But hey,
    why's the Brit in Albuquerque, and who left him there? Often, the
    intangibles of his downer vocal timbre denote felt emotion, but Carter
    would also do well to let loose some colorfully site-specific
    sentiments,
    giving his syllables a chance to catch up with the magical Victorian
    tapestries looping around them.</p></div>"|3345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3345-the-bluffers-guide-to-the-flight-deck/|7.4|Brian Howe & Brandon Stosuy

    melodies in the box-- most of the tracks simply don't have one. Opener
    ""Hot Stenographer"" has a nearly full-minute passage where all it does is go
    ""buh! Buh! Buh! Buh! Buh!"" until the fade-out-- fuzzed-out guitar and drums
    slamming every beat while nothing else happens. Other than that, the song
    is merely a neat riff without a song surrounding it.</p><p>
<em>Alpine Static</em> is full of fine
    musicianship, but there are a lot of songs that feel like something's missing, and that's a syndrome  that I've noticed
    on truckloads of recent instrumental albums, including a few previous Kinski efforts. It's unfortunate that so many vocal-less seem allergic to offering the
    listener something to latch onto beyond a wall of fuzzy guitar and an
    occasional tempo shift.</p><p>
    
    To their credit, Kinski do sometimes give you more than just riffs and drums
    fills on <em>Alpine Static</em>, such as the tweaked-out solos that rampage over
    ""The Wives of Artie Shaw"" (guess you gotta solo if you're gonna name a track
    after Shaw). The thing is, Kinski in rock mode, where they spend the
    majority of this LP, is Kinski at their weakest, considerably less
    interesting than when they put on their other hat, which is made of
    elegantly sculpted, brooding space-noise. Their last record, 2004's <em>Don't
    Climb on and Take the Holy Water</em>, focused on this sound to often arresting
    results, but this album mostly sounds like backpedaling until ""All your Kids
    Have Turned to Static"", a slowly meandering piece of pastoral psych with
    flute coloring the edges. It's the only track of its kind in the Kinski
    catalog, and it's one of their best.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, it's only an island in a sea, and that sea churns with
    distortion and kickdrum, frequently feeling directionless. ""The Snowy Parts
    of Scandinavia"" has a promising intro of slowly morphing ambience, but it devolves into an
    inept rip-off of Mogwai's ""Like Herod"" before churning into what sounds like a Sonic Youth outtake, circa 1991.
    So the album as a whole is intensely frustrating. Kinski have the potential,
    the skill, the other requisite intangibles to be awe-inspiring, but somehow
    they keep shooting left of the mark.</p></div>"|4464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4464-alpine-static/|5.9|Joe Tangari

He takes a similar approach to his new project as he did his old band, adding dark lyrics and complex emotions to the pop of the fifties. But where the Rock*A*Teens played an artful, echo-laden take on rockabilly, Tenement Halls takes traditional pop and plays it through a murky wall of sound.</p><p>
<em>Knitting Needles and Bicycle Bells</em> builds distinctive walls of instrumentation, mostly from organs, pianos, and guitars. But rather than an inimitable Spector-like sound, where every instrument can be clearly heard, <em>Knitting Needles</em> is muddy. Organs and pianos drone on, and guitars escape from the mire now and then, but it's an impenetrable pastiche of instruments that needs Lopez's voice to pull them out. I think there's some sweeping cello work under the jangling guitars of ""Charlemagne"", but I can't quite tell. That's probably a guitar being plucked in ""Marry Me"", but I can't get past the keyboard effect that sounds like dentist's drill, not to mention one of <em>Knitting Needles</em> whiniest vocal performances. The simple, swaying chord changes are clamoring for a voice to belt out a melody and carry them forward. Lopez wails, begs, and hollers hoarsely at the top of his range, but he never quite sings.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps more sparse instrumentation would have suited Lopez' romantic melodies. The speedy skip of ""Plenty Is Never Enough"" gets by on just acoustic guitar and a few pounded keys, and it's one of the album's more tolerable songs. If you're stalwart enough to have made it this far into the disc, you still have to deal with ""Marry Me"", and that's enough to send anyone over the nearest bridge even before hearing the toy-piano plink of ""When the Swifts Come Home"" or the swinging church bell sing-along ""Wicked Wicked Ways"".</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, Lopez sounds like a defeated man. No matter how perky opener ""Silver from the Silt"" sounds, it's weighed down by the repetition of ""Just quit, just quit, it's the best you will find down"", full of resignation. ""Now She Knows"" spits disillusionment through it's muddy meandering, with lines like ""All that glitters isn't gold/ It's just shimmering paint on a cast-iron saint/ A scotch-sucking brute in a Brooks Brothers suit"", a quirky bit of antiquated bile. Lopez likely has more perspective these days, and he's brave for starting over in the face of relative apathy towards his old band, but as the lone player and producer here, he could still use some guidance and maybe another set of ears.</p></div>"|8300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8300-knitting-needles-and-bicycle-bells/|5.3|Jason Crock

    1. Does it matter if I haven't seen the movie?<br/>
    2. Does it matter if I have seen the movie, and think it's great, and think the music goes with it, but hate the soundtrack on its own?<br/>
    3. Can I only like the soundtrack because it reminds me of the movie?<br/>
    4. Is it really a good ""soundtrack"" if I love the music but hate the movie?<br/>
    5. When pop stars write soundtracks, isn't it better when they just contribute a few ""real"" songs and keep the noodling ""atmospherics"" to a minimum?<br/>
    6. Why does there have to be noodling, ""atmospheric"" music in movies?</p><p>
    I've long held a bias against soundtracks. Not for their use, mind you: a good soundtrack can make a movie better than its sum of train explosions, drug deals and awkward romances. However, taken on their own terms, soundtracks tend to reek of passive-aggression. I can imagine how tough it was to score music that complimented, yet never overwhelmed, a film, but my attention span usually demands more than music that just suggests emotion. Not that original scores are all bad-- I have soft spots for Danny Elfman, Bernard Herrmann and Nino Rota-- but in the best case, I imagine the symbiotic relationship between music and film to be a little more interesting a lot more often.</p><p>
    Björk's music for Matthew Barney's <em>Drawing Restraint 9</em>-- in which the singer also stars-- is her second foray into film music (after 2000's <i>Selmasongs</i>), and commits all the crimes and good deeds a soundtrack should. I haven't seen the movie, so I can only guess that throat singers and chimes enhanced it. However, there are context clues suggesting Björk went out of her way to, well, get out of the way of the action onscreen. Pieces like the low brass-heavy ""Hunter Vessel"" and ""Vessel Shimenawa"" alternate the fat squelch of trombones, trumpets, and horns with more ethereal chord clusters, evocative of perhaps a rocky landscape that meets the sea. Stripped of visuals, there is still an impression left, one that nails a kind of cold distance very well, but doesn't sound like anything specifically.</p><p>
    Still, I'm most drawn to the songs, and there are some notable ones for Björk fans. First is ""Gratitude"", featuring solo vocals by Will Oldham. The song is very much in the vein of the classic Björkian ballad, with a flowing, seemingly open-ended melody that is running away from conventional pop phraseology as much as it seems ""accessible."" Oldham handles its melodies well, though to my ears, sounds a bit broken and delicate where I imagine Björk would be strident and flighty. Nevertheless, supported by harp, bells and chimes, and featuring neat instrumental interludes that remind me of the xylophones in Steve Reich's <em>Drumming, it's pleasant and unmistakably Björk. However, my favorite song is ""Storm"", which the composer has performed live over the past few years. Over a sinister backdrop of synth, rain, creaking doors (all of which appear and disappear without notice), Björk's lone vocal soars in the chorus (?) like the booming siren of a blue whale who suddenly realized she was the last of her species. The tragic, detached vibe of the track only makes what sounds bitterly lonely all the more pressing. This would have been a highlight on </em><em>Medulla</em> or <i>Vespertine</i>, much less here.</p><p>
    And then there are the rest: A sound art piece based on throat singing (and very reminiscent of <em>Medulla</em>'s ""Ancestors""), a longer (and way more excruciating if you don't happen to be into traditional Japanese Noh vocals) exotic vocal piece, some nice, if innocuous electro-music-box stuff and a couple of lesser vocals by Björk (the trippy, plasmatic ballad ""Bath"" and simpler, brighter ""Cetacea""). And that's where I usually end up with moderately interesting soundtracks: A couple of really cool parts, and the rest I don't feel so bad for forgetting. I'm not sure I learned a ton about the form, but Björk's entry is more interesting than most.</p></div>"|739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/739-drawing-restraint-9/|7.0|Dominique Leone

Existing against this dire backdrop makes the New Pornographers look even more singular. It's almost unfair, in a way, given that the Pornographers aren't so much a band as a Davis Cup team of Canada's finest indie singer-songwriters, captained by veteran Carl Newman. When Newman, Destroyer's Dan Bejar, and Neko Case first got together (with, it should be noted, other random Canadians) to record <i>Mass Romantic</i>, it seemed to be a goofy, feverish one-off, like a boozy weekend that accidentally birthed an indie pop classic. When the LP became arguably bigger than any of their individual endeavors, the three reunited for <i>Electric Version</i>, but couldn't keep the momentum rolling, suggesting the project's magic was fleeting.</p>
<p><i>Twin Cinema</i> doesn't just rebut that notion, it renders it ludicrous. With more developed ideas than <i>Mass Romantic</i> and a more cohesive sound than <i>Electric Version</i>, it's their most consistent, confident, and best album to date. Newman is once again at the wheel for the majority of the LP, furthering the notion that the New Pornographers are just Zumpano with added starpower. But this time Newman folds in the more mature sound he pursued whilst under the name A.C., focusing more on rich, Joe Jackson-style piano than arcade keyboards, and getting a lot of mileage out of the ebow. Newman's characteristic pop gems are present and accounted for (""Sing Me Spanish Techno"", ""Use It""), but most thrilling are the moments where he expands his sound, be it the disorienting, cyclical chorus of ""Falling Through Your Clothes"" or the shrilly upper-register, surprisingly funky ""Three or Four"".</p>
<p>It's a small disappointment that Neko Case's internal vocoder isn't applied to another rave-up, but Newman directs her well through two ballads, the off-kilter ""The Bones of an Idol"" and the wistful ""These Are the Fables"". Even Bejar contributes tracks that actually sound like they were recorded with the rest of the band in the room. ""Jackie, Dressed in Cobras"" may or may not revive the character from his <i>Mass Romantic</i> highlight, but it's a perfect integration of Bejar's acrid vocals into the more hyper Pornographer sound, the corners softened by Case's Children's Workshop harmonies and Newman's piano punctuations.</p>
<p>Yet in the upset of the year, it's drummer Kurt Dahle who practically steals <i>Twin Cinema</i>'s show. On prior NP efforts the drums were almost an afterthought. Here the percussion is pushed to the front of the mix, and Dahle's swing and crash put tracks like ""The Jessica Numbers"" and ""The Bleeding Heart Show"" over the top. The eight-armed drumming that fills every corner of ""Use It"", or <i>The Soft Bulletin</i>-esque drum-bash coda to ""These Are the Fables"" allow Newman to continue his indulgence with the Who (reference ""35 in the Shade"" with ""Boris the Spider""), nicking ""Armenia City in the Sky"" for the more astral portions of ""Stacked Crooked"".</p>
<p>The added rhythmic complexity is just one way in which the New Pornographers successfully tweak established formulas and set themselves apart. Sure, at their core, the songs of <i>Twin Cinema</i> have that catchy, melodic something that forces me to reach repeatedly for the p-word, but for Newman &amp; co., instant hummability isn't the endpoint but the foundation. Whether it's weaving in opaque, double-meaning lyrics or sneaking a horn part way deep in the mix, the compositions on <i>Twin Cinema</i> are immediate yet multi-layered. They'd be great in their own right, but by comparison to the plagiaristic, closed-minded, infinitely repeating world of power pop, it's all the more special an accomplishment.</p></div>"|5773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5773-twin-cinema/|9.0|Rob Mitchum

You'd think that any music containing drums and guitars and feverish singing would find a willing (secular) audience, so perhaps it's the faith that jumbles the translation. Of course, gospel-studded résumés abound in r&amp;b;, but even then, it's generally an aesthetic component of gospel singing rather than actual hymns that makes it the radio. Popular faith-based (okay, Christianity-based) music is out there-- survey scattered songs Sufjan Stevens, Kanye West, U2, Pedro the Lion-- but in rock, more generally accepted are an occasional God shout out at the Grammys or the dreaded backing choir, aka Foreigner's and R. Kelly's secret weapon. Something seems amiss.</p><p>
    So, when free jazz guys and avant-garde singers come along and put their spin on gospel tunes, I'm struck. British guitarist Derek Bailey is no stranger to covers: Despite almost 50 years of free improvisation, his beginnings were in pop standards with a small jazz combo, and 2002's <em>Ballads</em> found him revisiting that mode, albeit in his uber-idiosyncratic style. On <i>The Gospel Record, he joins American composer/vocalist Amy Denio (Science Group, EC Nudes, Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet) and synth/sampler improviser Dennis Palmer for a short set of old-time gospel-- as in, the kind featured on Smithsonian anthologies or Coen brothers movies-- and in the process, exposes music ripe for the interpretive plucking.</i></p><p>
    After a short spoken invocation in the slowed down drawl of a surreal Southern preacher, Denio and Palmer harmonize the verses of Albert E. Brumley's ""Let the Little Sunbeam In"" over Bailey's sometimes tonal, sometimes way-out distorted electric guitar. Denio's vocals are clear as day, sounding very much like the star of modest country church, and the trio keeps the original harmonies intact. Bailey's accompaniment is perfect, elegantly suggesting the original chord progression with spiked drones and the occasional shard of dissonance. W. Oliver Cooper and Minzo C. Jones' ""Heaven Will Surely Be Worth It All"" gets a rougher treatment, with Palmer's martial, oppressive drum machine going to battle with Bailey's flickering, pointillist figures. Again, Denio's pure alto seems non-phased by the chaos around, though is kept at bay by the electric storm.</p><p>
    Classic Southern hymn ""The Ole-Time Religion"" is presented as an instrumental and features more pounding drum machine backing Bailey's scattershot lines. Palmer also injects some synth sounds, running the gamut from eerie backwards percussion noises to what sounds like a small UFO taking off. This leads straight into Vep Ellis' ""Joshua Led God's Children"", as Denio's solo vocal is doubled by a rubbery bass patch from Palmer. During the refrain, Denio goes into the stratosphere with her vocals, singing in an unnaturally high register; she ends the song on a high note too, and the reverb from her vocal acts as the song's momentary fade-out. ""I'm Gonna See Heaven"" brings the vocal harmonies back, but is almost completely overtaken by Palmer's stomping, chomping synth and drum machine attack. Bailey is almost buried by the frenzy, though his guitar's overtones punctuate the brief silences in between electro-squelches.</p><p>
    Sometimes, the interpretations border on the surreal, though I'm more taken with the whirlwind pace: all of these songs are crammed into just over 14 minutes. The trio ends <em>The Gospel Record</em> with a rare moment of tenderness during the final phrase of ""I'm Bound for the Land of Canaan"", I'm reminded of the traveling sideshows that went through the American South 100 years ago, featuring all manner of decidedly non-sacred entertainments only to close with a group hymn before skipping town. If Bailey, Denio and Palmer have subversive aims, this music succeeds in spite of itself. Hardly irreverent, this is old time religion full made interesting and with more vitality than you can, er, shake a stick at.</p></div>"|531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/531-the-gospel-record/|8.0|Dominique Leone

Seldom has this familial bond appeared as literal, however, as with the release of <em>Wedlock, a double album recorded in Alaska at the wedding of group members Paul Labrecque and Valerie Webb. And though the live, impromptu nature of these recordings means they contain some of the group's slackest, most loosely-organized performances yet-- certainly no mean feat-- the album also captures several peaks of the spontaneous joy and inspired mutual discovery that typify the group's best work. </em></p><p>
    
    Sunburned Hand of the Man's creative timeline has always been too wavy and discursive to strictly delineate any pure trends or patterns, but the June 2003 date of these recordings lands them somewhere chronologically and sonically between the release of their 2002 album <em>Headdress</em> and that of <em>Trickle Down. At least a dozen group-related musicians-- including such honorary band members as Chris Corsano-- made the voyage to Alaska to celebrate, make music, and (apparently) fly-fish, though it certainly sounds as though none of the other wedding guests were discouraged from active participation.</em></p><p>
<em>Wedlock opens with ""The Procession"", the only track included that was not recorded at the actual wedding itself. Instead, this piece is a loose assemblage of various fragments gathered on the journey to Alaska, and it immediately sets the album's tone of loopy, high-spirited adventure. Woven together by bassist Rob Thomas, the finished track features snatches of acoustic slide guitar, engine hums, police sirens and numerous samples of infectious laughter, vaguely resembling some of John Fahey's late-90s abstract collages.</em></p><p>
    
    From there on the album unfolds in virtual real time, as the subsequent six live tracks appear in the same order they were played at what must have been one whale of a ceremony. ""The Tent City Police"", which sounds like it could be a Headdress outtake, is anchored by Thomas' wickedly funky bassline, glimmering <em>Bitches Brew keys, and distorted, impressionistic vocals that (one can only assume) transmit bountiful good tidings to the happy couple. Later on, percussive, unfettered improvisations like ""Sunshine Suit"" and the extended title track are increasingly punctuated by rippling, Jerry Garcia-like single-note guitar runs as well as by the ambient peripheral conversations of the ongoing wedding reception.</em></p><p>
    
    As the evening progresses, the group gradually transition to more acoustic instrumentation, portable hand percussion, and ever-looser song structures. Cuts like ""The Agency"" and ""Double Invincibility"" eventually devolve into a primitive, Godz-like gypsy flutter, and though undoubtedly great fun to experience live, their disheveled charms generally decrease with each successive playback. But, as the album closes with Dave Bird's gracious best man speech, one is reminded that <em>Wedlock's music was constructed as a mere complement to the bonds of friendship and family, and that it is those bonds that provide this album its lasting, understated resonance.</em></p></div>"|7572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7572-wedlock/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

Forget Starsailor, Keane, or any other one-word, sleepy-head outfit, Reykjavik ensemble the Leaves are pulling off the best Coldplay masquerade right now. Sure, they play the same bubble-wrapped pop, but at least it feels like the first time.</p><p>
    From the slurred coos to the airy, angelic falsetto choruses, frontman Arnar Gudjonsson is an impeccable Chris Martin 2.0, though he's armed with more dignified lyrics than ""there could be computers/ Looking for life on Earth."" The lush instrumentation also handcuffs these guys to Martin and Co., with <em>The Angela Test</em> sounding like a Coldplay studio session highjacked by equally benevolent terrorists. Whether intentional or not, Leaves often circumvent these similarities on more ethereal, sprawling numbers. Bookmarked by ""Shakma (Drunken Starlit Sky)"" and ""Should Have Seen It All"", which span over a combined 17 minutes, they flirt with Sigur Rós experimentation though ultimately opt for protracted pop song structures and direct, larger-than-life vocals.</p><p>
    Unfortunately that dabbling sets the limit for how deep the Leaves wish to explore, and most of the album mires in a mid-tempo post-Britpop bog. You know the type-- a soft piano cues even softer vocals, some processed strings give their two cents, drums that might as well be strings, and a few teaser guitar parts before the song explodes into an epiphany of a refrain large enough to affront a god. Laughable as the formula may sound, the Leaves occasionally make gravy with it, particularly on single ""The Spell"" and ""Killing Flies"", a two-faced lullaby that mutates into a strident early-MBV noise collage.</p><p>
    Mostly, however, this formula falls flat on its face, and Gudjonsson resigns to the ole' ""I'm gonna keep holding this note until it sounds pretty"" bit, taking yet another page from Martin's book. ""Good Enough"" is a commendable stab at rocking, but those distorted guitars can't hide the uncanny resemblance to ""God Put a Smile Upon Your Face"". While the mimicry is frustrating, it's hard to really flog these guys. For whatever it's worth, they're doing the Coldplay thing better than Coldplay, sans the whole self-conscious, self-important <em>idée fixe</em>. <em>The Angela Test may only be a sheep in wolves clothing, but they're at least humble enough to acknowledge the costume zippers.</em></p></div>"|4988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4988-the-angela-test/|6.2|Adam Moerder

Needless to say, these records sound great, but they don't always hold up extremely well. Like Quentin Tarantino delivering a dramatic line reading, Lanois's considerable talents are weakest when it comes to composition. Inspired by a trip to Mexico, <em>Belladonna</em> sounds technically flawless-- every marimba strike and fret run has a specific texture that's almost miniaturist in its realistic detail-- but it's all in service to vocal-less songs that are ponderous and dull, whose strict adherence to an overriding motif hems them in.</p><p>
    
    Belladonna refers to the herb <em>Atropa belladonna</em>, or deadly nightshade, whose poison results in, among other symptoms, total loss of voice-- which makes it a particularly apt title for an album of instrumentals. The overall scheme is almost soundtrack-like in nature, or rather like a nature soundtrack. Rumbling feedback on opener ""Two Worlds"" suggests storms on the horizon, time-delay shots of clouds morphing rapidly past-- New Agey mood scenes conveying the passage of time or the amorality of an arid desert floor. The songs that follow take a similar tack, and song titles refer to south-of-the-border locales or fauna -- ""Oaxaca"", ""Agave"", ""Desert Rose"", ""Todos Santos"" -- giving specificity to the vague evocations of the music. For better or worse, such earthly signposts work to ground the music's spacey ambience.</p><p>
    
    Lanois communicates this ethereality mostly through his pedal steel, which recalls <em>Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks</em>, his 1983 collaboration with Eno. Lanois manages to coax some lovely textures and melodies out of the instrument, as on the florid notes of ""Desert Rose"" and ""Carla"", but typically it gets lost among the other elements, proving the least compelling element on the album. As a result, the songs often fold into one another, distinguishable only by inspired flourishes like the reggae rhythms of ""Frozen"", the Mariachi horns on ""Agave"" and Brad Mehldau's sparkling keyboard melodies on ""Sketches"". Lanois is aiming for a kind of ascetic aesthetic, with each song a sort of musical haiku: concise, disciplined, sublime. But on <em>Belladonna</em> less is not more, but merely much less. The album is so stuffy and self-serious that it practically demands your respect and admiration. However, it rarely commands your attention, so it doesn't reward much of anything.</p></div>"|4951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4951-belladonna/|3.8|Stephen M. Deusner

Goddard. The book also provided the backbone for the group's debut LP, <em>The Vineland Social Maturity Scale</em>, which combined subtle pop melodies, organic folk, and bits of electronic noise. For their newest release, Kallikak brainchild Andrew Peterson has moved even further away from traditional structure, employing layers of field recordings, ambient noise, and non-verbal vocals to create an outstanding cut/paste ambient
    collage that is propelled by a continuous onslaught of fresh ideas, wistful beauty, and haunting arrangements.</p><p>
<em>May 23rd 2007</em> is also a sort of concept album, telling the story of a time-obsessed man and the date on which he is expected to die, both of which are identified as May 23rd 2007. Much of that storyline is beside the point, though, since it isn't indicated anywhere in the album's beautiful packaging or, for that matter, in the music itself. There are no lyrics to tell a story, only sliced bits of vocal noises and the occasional ooh and ahh. Instead, Peterson constructs textures of sound based primarily on ambient noise.</p><p>
    
    Unlike most album that are tagged ""ambient,"" <em>May 23rd 2007</em> constantly shifts and morphs between engaging sounds and styles, drifting from drones to c'n'p edits to pastoral folk. At once comforting and alien, the record blends pop sensibilities and snatches of delicate, off-kilter melody with free-flowing experimentation and avant-garde leanings. Several tracks incorporate breakbeat-style electronic drums (most notably the title track and ""Portland, Oregon part 4""), and two songs are delivered via acoustic guitar (the appropriately titled ""Guitar 1"" and ""Guitar 2""), but for the most part <em>May 23rd 2007</em> is an amalgam of tones, sampled snippets, and tape manipulation. Given this description, there are many artists who come to mind (the Books, the Wind-Up Bird, even Philip Glass), but to confuse similarity of style with similarity of ideas is to sell all of those artists short.</p><p>
    
    The Kallikak Family succeeds by creating a beautiful, flowing piece of music that is at once engaging and understated. At times it can be heart-wrenchingly sad, yet the uplifting are both impassioned and beautiful. With 17 tracks, each averaging about two minutes in length, Peterson gets the most out of his ideas, building a record that blends seamlessly yet shifts shapes both over the course of the LP and within each track. As a result, the true magnitude of <em>May 23rd 2007</em> seeps out slowly, divulging more of its secrets with each listen.</p></div>"|4601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4601-may-23rd-2007/|8.2|Cory D.

    gift to short attention spans everywhere. Also including members of
    Electric Soft Parade and the Tenderfoot, Brakes is fronted by British
    Sea Power's Eamon Hamilton, and besides Hamilton's mealy-mouthed
    singing, the only thing the two bands share is a record deal with
    Rough Trade. Forget wall-of-sound pop glamour; forget coded references
    to Dostoevsky; forget ruminative death ballads and arcane concepts.
    Blazing through 16 songs in less than half an hour-- the longest
    clocking in at about three-and-a-half minutes, the shortest at seven
    seconds-- Brakes has turned out a weird, riotous post-(cow)punk
    screed.</p><p>
    Yeah, cowpunk. A country twang creeps into the album periodically:
    Check the bright jangle of ""NY Pie"", where Hamilton affects a
    hilarious Southern drawl (American punk bands have been mangling
    British accents forever, and turnabout's fair play) to riff on
    big-city dreams with the curious but intuitively coherent refrain,
    ""Oh, get me a pony."" But the stylistic hopscotch doesn't stop there.
    The shuffle beat, lockstep bass, and explosive post-punk chorus of
    ""All Night Disco Party"" winks slyly in DFA's direction. The 30-second
    ""Pick Up the Phone"" precisely apes the Fall, with its careening chords
    and histrionic vocal rhythm. ""I Can't Stand to Stand Beside You"" is
    textbook Mission of Burma, with its abrupt shifts between gliding,
    repetitive menace and fist-pumping pop-punk choruses, while songs like
    ""You'll Always Have a Place to Stay"" and ""The Most Fun"" trade in
    aggression for dirgey indie-pop.</p><p>
    If it sounds all over the place, it is, but because Brakes couch their
    divagations in directness and simplicity, it all hangs together. Their
    scene-baiting rants and snotty, high-octane punk fill the void vacated
    by the late, great Mclusky, masters of the pointedly absurd tirade.
    Like Mclusky, Brakes are at their best when they're sending up the
    scene and its discontents. ""Heard About Your Band"" could be an answer
    to Art Brut's ""Formed a Band"": ""I heard about your band/ Whatever
    dude!"" With lines like ""You should have brought Karen O"" and ""You met
    Electralene, eh?"", Hamilton sneers at trendy rockers, and thankfully,
    he comes off more like a petty, mean-spirited prick than a
    self-righteous artiste. ""Hi How Are You?"" begins with a précis of
    scenester pick-up lines, including ""what do you do,"" ""how do you
    dress,"" and ""who are your friends,"" before being abruptly cockblocked
    with ""Won't you shut the fuck up, I'm just trying to watch the band.""
    And Brakes sum up their political stance on ""Cheney"", which wreaks
    havoc for all of 10 seconds, stating in its entirety: ""Cheney,
    Cheney, Cheney, stop being such a dick!"" Too often, satirical rock
    gets so caught up in the conceit it forgets to rock, but Hamilton and
    co. never forget the wisdom of Blues Traveler: ""The hook brings you
    back."" Now someone get this man a pony. </p></div>"|1173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1173-give-blood/|7.5|Brian Howe

He hails from Calgary, where he busked street corners and subways for years, gradually building up a large catalog of original songs. Using a variety of instruments and equipment-- some of which he's fashioned by hand-- the relentless DIY'er has recorded hundreds of his songs in a makeshift studio in his bedroom, where you can imagine him retreating from a frigid evening. On his debut album, <em>Infiniheart, which was released in Canada earlier this year and which Sub Pop is now releasing domestically, that crisp chill hangs over every chiming note and every booming beat. Even the packaging cannot escape the cold front: Snow-white and ice-blue dominate the cover artwork, and the inner sleeve is wind-chapped pink.</em></p><p>
    
    This chilliness suggests an album full of spare, soft songs conveying subtle emotions, which is accurate but only to a degree. While he keeps his accompaniment to a minimum, VanGaalen is no minimalist. His songs are balanced with only a few carefully chosen elements, as if he has expended a great deal of energy trying to avoid adding another instrument here or overworking a beat there. But the range of sounds on <em>Infiniheart is impressively wide: When VanGaalen culled these 16 from the hundreds in his vault, he chose with an ear toward the eclectic, showcasing his musical ingenuity. </em></p><p>
    
    In fact, there's an almost maximalist spectrum of sound on <em>Infiniheart, and the album is all the more impressive for creating and maintaining such a specific mood over 16 songs. Brushes stir against snares on ""Blood Machine"" imitating slow respiration, and the prismatic guitars of ""Liquid + Light"" and ""Somewhere I Know There Is Nothing"" evoke the cutting cold in the air and the sharp glare of sunlight off frozen snow. On ""1000 Pound Eyelids"" a bleary trumpet suggests the bending metal and breaking bones of a car crash, and the sharp notes of a dobro and a breezy penny whistle pierce ""Sunshine Snare Hits"".</em></p><p>
    
    VanGaalen's guitar can be gentle or brutal, his beats reserved or ostentatious, and he has sequenced the album to showcase this dynamic. The two-guitar coda of ""Kill Me in My Sleep"", which is perhaps best described as ""gossamer"", is immediately followed by the instrumental ""J.C.'s Head on the Cross"", which bounces frenetically on thudding beats. He sings these songs in a voice that stretches towards a shivering falsetto, which cracks noticeably on ""Chronograph #1"" and adds to the otherworldliness of ""Red Blood"" and the videogamey ""The Warp Zone/Hidden Bridge"".</p><p>
    
    If this chilliness enlivens the music, it unfortunately dampens VanGaalen's songwriting, which relies too heavily on weighty, sci-fi concepts that seem frozen and immobile. In theory, such reliance suggests a unique vision, unflinching in its conception and execution, but in practice, he too often sounds coldly remote, more aloof than elusive. ""Clinically Dead"" starts the album with the demise of a man-machine: ""Clinically he was dead, and the modem inside his head was still working."" Conceptually, it recalls the Flaming Lips (who based an entire album on the heartbreaking inner conflict of a crime-fighting cartoon) and Grandaddy (who based an entire album on the melding of humanity and machines in a post-apocalyptic world), but those artists play with the distance between their subject matter and the emotions they intend to communicate. Very rarely does any self-awareness come through on <em>Infiniheart.</em></p><p>
    
    When his flights of fancy are anchored in the actual, <em>Infiniheart becomes a powerful combination of words and music. ""After the Afterlife"" asks about such mundane matters as a mother's haircut and a father's drug habit before conjuring eerie seaweed imagery that hints at tragedy. And ""Chronograph #1"", about a party whose guest of honor is noticeably absent, possesses more gravity than any of his oddball lyrics. But still, those cumbersome songs stand out the most, especially ""Blood Machine"", which imagines a </em><em>Matrix</em>-like underworld where everyone is hooked up to a ""giant machine that could circulate blood."" He tries to connect it to larger, existential issues, but despite the fluttering guitarwork, the song falls flat: ""One of them explained to me/ how they used to be free/ Before the machines got built/ And before there were laws regulating free will."" To his credit, VanGaalen invests those clunky lines with a vocal intensity that's surprisingly graceful and even poignant. That's ultimately the sticking point with <em>Infiniheart: VanGaalen's songs tend toward folly, yet it's impossible to discount his commitment to the material.

The disc plays like a sex operation gone botched-- Adonis to Medusa in 10 minutes tops. Three songs into a promising start, the I Am Kloot of yesteryear rears its lyrically asinine head, which wouldn't be so bad if the Kloot didn't regard themselves as ""Harold Pinter real deal to everyone else's overblown, Cecil B. de Mille mock-ups.""</p><p>
    
    More problems arise when this band wants to be somebody's soundtrack-- all vampires and exotic places-- and from there the degeneration's traceable: The straightforward ""No Direction"" largely succeeds, ""Over My Shoulder"" straddles the good-to-ugly divide, and ""An Ordinary Girl"" is a full-blown suck-fest. Moody Doves-like undercurrents work in small doses but wilt when spooned out in large doses.</p><p>
    
    If you're looking for reference points, Cinerama's shtick isn't far off, except that was <i>smart</i>. You never caught David Gedge singing about the ""bald raging flame of your heart"" or recounting Gothic tales of ""ordinary"" girls in what he thinks are fifty-pence words. I Am Kloot singer John Bramwell's execution is gloomily expressive at best, melodramatic as a rule, and when the Wurlitzers materialize like dry ice at a Backstreet Boys concert, shit's more exasperating than convincing-- and tiresome, too. </p><p>
    
    While it's true that stories don't tell themselves, Kloot's stories might speak volumes if Bramwell sang less. Loungey ""Avenue of Hope"" could be an Angry Inch B-side, if this Hedwig were a wholly sincere woman with a deep voice and razor-thin vocal range instead of an affected man with with an overdeveloped sense of misanthropy and a  razor-thin vocal range. ""Hong Kong Lullaby"" feels like a cheap shot at fluffy pillow-softness, offering respite from billowing swells of over-instrumentation but little else; ""I Believe"", a weirdly compelling Nick Drake anthem-cum-rescue mission, comes tacked on as a bedside prayer finale that also fails to salvage or move (to tears or otherwise) thanks to the tyranny of circumstance. For all their godlike aspiration, it's a shame that I Am Kloot basically don't do Genesis. </p></div>"|4158.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4158-gods-and-monsters/|6.0|Rachel Khong

    ""traditional"" artists re-interpret music originally
    conceived for an entirely different context. You wonder if
    they're making a statement first and thinking about the
    music second. It can seem as though the artist with a
    stronger connection to high culture is either extending a
    hand down to welcome the other half into the club. Or,
    perhaps they're just having a laugh. A string quartet is
    playing Metallica songs, see, because Metallica are actually
    interesting composers. See also Sebastian Cabot, Actor/Bob
    Dylan, Poet.</p><p>
    
    New music ensemble Alarm Will Sound decided to follow its
    album of Steve Reich compositions with a record of
    all-acoustic interpretations of pieces by the Aphex Twin,
    but nothing about the project suggests condescension. Based
    on the music and presentation this seems more like an
    ambitious collective on the hunt for challenging projects,
    and the idea of scoring and arranging pieces that have lived
    their entire lives inside a computer was too tempting to
    pass up. In a sense Richard D. James seems the natural choice
    for such a tribute, both because of his surpassing melodic
    sense and that he's already penetrated the serious world
    through collaboration with Philip Glass. A large assortment
    of hoses, whistles, shop hardware, and piano treatments were
    gathered for timbral approximations, after the tracks were
    selected (curiously, most are from most from <i>Drukqs</i>) and
    notated, and this is the result.</p><p>
    
    Though it never sounds to me like a gimmick, <em>Acoustica
    remains oddly distant and difficult to inhabit. This music,
    often geared toward atmosphere and sound for sound's sake,
    is difficult to absorb when scored for traditional
    instruments and easily slips into the background. Generally,
    the better and more exciting the original track, the more
    the Alarm Will Sound version pales by comparison. On tracks
    like ""Meltphace 6"" where the distinctive rolling drums serve
    as the lead instrument, Alarm Will Sound sounds overly
    restrained, with its conservatory roots at the Eastman
    School of Music in full view. That they would even attempt
    to record something like ""Cock/Ver 10"" live with acoustic
    instruments is impressive, certainly, but the music itself
    doesn't quite survive the translation and loses its sense of
    purpose.</em></p><p>
    
    Better are the tracks that were in their initial form more
    open-ended. The short industrial percussion ditty ""Prep
    Gwarlek 3B"" finds new life with live instrumentation, and
    its unusual rhythm and texture easier becomes easier to
    digest. The digital gamelan ""Jynweythek Ylow"" loses a pang
    of longing without the sound of James's music box, but Alarm
    Will Sound find the melodic core at the piece's center.
    Still, though <em>Acoustica is an interesting album and not
    unpleasant to listen to, but nowhere does it capture James's
    energy or musical wit. It reminds me of when Derrick May
    did an Invisible Jukebox session for the UK experimental
    music magazine </em><em>The Wire</em> and the interviewer played him a brass
    band version of ""Strings of Life"". His strong initial
    excitement quickly dissipated and he groaned, ""Oh, I wish it
    were better.""</p></div>"|481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/481-acoustica/|5.9|Mark Richardson

Iggy     Pop was his animal soul, and when Iggy got loose on a stage just about     anything could happen. With the Stooges he was the     mesmerizing center of a maelstrom that helped to invent a whole host of rock's     musical clichés, a group that spun primal fury and     young adult frustration into some of the ugliest, most brutal, most alive     music of its era.</p>
<p>There were other subversive, confrontational rock acts before the     Stooges-- the cover of the band's eponymous debut even subtly references the Doors'     own self-titled album-- but nobody before them had the good sense to take it     as far over the top as they did. Even the band's sturdiest compositions     have a feeling of instability about them, like they might collapse or fly     asunder at any moment, and there are moments when Iggy can't help screaming     and grunting as if he's trying to challenge Ron Asheton's guitar to some     nihilistic duel. In the middle of the hippie era, their grimy, depraved, and     violent take on love and life had no natural place, which is perhaps why it     holds up so well.</p>
<p>The Stooges' first two albums are a case study in a band marking its     territory with a debut and then systematically destroying that territory and     everything in it on their second. As rough and abrasive as <i>The Stooges is,     it sounds positively genteel next to the apocalyptic garage meltdown of </i><i>Fun     House</i>. The debut was produced by     the Velvet Underground's John Cale, an art-conscious violist who worked hard     to get the Stooges a crisp, muscular sound that highlighted the bleakness of     their vision but made them perhaps less threatening on record than they were     on stage. For <i>Fun House</i>, the band got Don Gallucci,     whose previous claim to rock trivia fame was as the guy going ""duh duh duh,     duh duh, duh duh duh, duh duh"" on the keyboards on the Kingsmen's epochal     ""Louie Louie"". Gallucci essentially recorded <i>Fun     House as though it were a live album, letting the band simply attack the     songs in take after exhausting take, and though the recording is less than     perfect from a technical standpoint, it shoves the Stooges at the peak of     their powers right in your face.</i></p>
<p>Rhino's reissues do a fine job of shoving them even further,     benefitting from improved mastering that highlights the gut-punch     rhythm section of Dave Alexander and Scott Asheton, who never get enough     credit for being the band's pounding heart and tortured soul. Alexander's bass keeps things grounded in blues and     psychedelia, rumbling low and solid in the mix as Ron Asheton's lava guitar     flows around it and Dave Asheton pummels out the most basic and accordingly     perfect beats possible. The raging caveman groove they lay down on ""1969""     to open the debut is still one of the greatest undercarriages a rock song     has ever had.</p>
<p>The first album also contains the classic ""I Wanna Be Your     Dog"", notable almost as much for its inclusion of piano and sleigh bell in a     grinding rock arrangement as it is for its then-controversial refrain. The record also has two songs notable mostly for the fact that they show the     band going in a direction they never again pursued: ""We Will Fall"",     audaciously sequenced at track three, is a droning, 10-minute dirge     featuring a backing chant and Iggy's harrowing narration of a night in a     lonely hotel room. The way he sings, ""Then I lay right down/ On my back/ On my     bed/ In my hotel"" makes what looks insanely mundane on paper sound like the     last existential gasps of a dying mind. Less oppressive but no more upbeat     is ""Ann"", which is sort of the album's ballad if you wanted to stretch and     call it that. Iggy wails for a lost lover and Ron Asheton reels off a     sickeningly fuzzed-out guitar solo that anticipates the most unhinged     moments of <i>Fun House.</i></p>
<p>Unhinged is too weak a word for the wildest moments of <i>Fun House, especially     closer ""L.A. Blues"", a fiery freakout that's more heroin than LSD and makes     no pretense of song structure. Saxophonist Steven Mackay adds a nasty edge     to the album's second side, blazing right along with the rest of the band to     create a texture that sounds exactly like the album cover-- Iggy tossed     in a flaming sea, possibly hell. The record's first half is somewhat tamer,     with the heavy boogie of ""Down on the Street"" and the paranoid snarl of     ""T.V. Eye"", where the band plays with deadly efficiency behind Iggy's     demented vocal. Iggy actually captures the feel of the whole record in the     opening line of ""1970"": ""Out of my mind on a Saturday night.""</i></p>
<p>The reissues each add a whole disc of rarities, though hardcore fans will     already know the <i>Fun House extras from the 1970 boxed set, which is now out     of print. On </i><i>Stooges</i>, it's basically alternate mixes and extended versions,     while on <i>Fun House it's primarily outtakes, but given the volatility of the     material on that album, there's quite a bit of variation from version to     version. That said, none of the out-takes are particularly revelatory     outside a twisted, distended, sax-soaked version of ""1970"", and most casual     listeners will probably not spin disc two of either set more than once or     twice. </i><i>Fun House</i> does include two songs that didn't make the album, but     it's hard to see where either the ravaged blues of ""Slide (Slidin' the     Blues)"" or ""Lost in the Future"" would have fit without destroying the     record's momentum. That said, both songs offer a chance to hear more of     Mackay's sax playing and give a glimpse toward what the band might have     sounded like if a lineup had solidified with him in it.</p>

Iggy     Pop was his animal soul, and when Iggy got loose on a stage just about     anything could happen. With the Stooges he was the     mesmerizing center of a maelstrom that helped to invent a whole host of rock's     musical clichés, a group that spun primal fury and     young adult frustration into some of the ugliest, most brutal, most alive     music of its era.</p>
<p>There were other subversive, confrontational rock acts before the     Stooges-- the cover of the band's eponymous debut even subtly references the Doors'     own self-titled album-- but nobody before them had the good sense to take it     as far over the top as they did. Even the band's sturdiest compositions     have a feeling of instability about them, like they might collapse or fly     asunder at any moment, and there are moments when Iggy can't help screaming     and grunting as if he's trying to challenge Ron Asheton's guitar to some     nihilistic duel. In the middle of the hippie era, their grimy, depraved, and     violent take on love and life had no natural place, which is perhaps why it     holds up so well.</p>
<p>The Stooges' first two albums are a case study in a band marking its     territory with a debut and then systematically destroying that territory and     everything in it on their second. As rough and abrasive as <i>The Stooges is,     it sounds positively genteel next to the apocalyptic garage meltdown of </i><i>Fun     House</i>. The debut was produced by     the Velvet Underground's John Cale, an art-conscious violist who worked hard     to get the Stooges a crisp, muscular sound that highlighted the bleakness of     their vision but made them perhaps less threatening on record than they were     on stage. For <i>Fun House</i>, the band got Don Gallucci,     whose previous claim to rock trivia fame was as the guy going ""duh duh duh,     duh duh, duh duh duh, duh duh"" on the keyboards on the Kingsmen's epochal     ""Louie Louie"". Gallucci essentially recorded <i>Fun     House as though it were a live album, letting the band simply attack the     songs in take after exhausting take, and though the recording is less than     perfect from a technical standpoint, it shoves the Stooges at the peak of     their powers right in your face.</i></p>
<p>Rhino's reissues do a fine job of shoving them even further,     benefitting from improved mastering that highlights the gut-punch     rhythm section of Dave Alexander and Scott Asheton, who never get enough     credit for being the band's pounding heart and tortured soul. Alexander's bass keeps things grounded in blues and     psychedelia, rumbling low and solid in the mix as Ron Asheton's lava guitar     flows around it and Dave Asheton pummels out the most basic and accordingly     perfect beats possible. The raging caveman groove they lay down on ""1969""     to open the debut is still one of the greatest undercarriages a rock song     has ever had.</p>
<p>The first album also contains the classic ""I Wanna Be Your     Dog"", notable almost as much for its inclusion of piano and sleigh bell in a     grinding rock arrangement as it is for its then-controversial refrain. The record also has two songs notable mostly for the fact that they show the     band going in a direction they never again pursued: ""We Will Fall"",     audaciously sequenced at track three, is a droning, 10-minute dirge     featuring a backing chant and Iggy's harrowing narration of a night in a     lonely hotel room. The way he sings, ""Then I lay right down/ On my back/ On my     bed/ In my hotel"" makes what looks insanely mundane on paper sound like the     last existential gasps of a dying mind. Less oppressive but no more upbeat     is ""Ann"", which is sort of the album's ballad if you wanted to stretch and     call it that. Iggy wails for a lost lover and Ron Asheton reels off a     sickeningly fuzzed-out guitar solo that anticipates the most unhinged     moments of <i>Fun House.</i></p>
<p>Unhinged is too weak a word for the wildest moments of <i>Fun House, especially     closer ""L.A. Blues"", a fiery freakout that's more heroin than LSD and makes     no pretense of song structure. Saxophonist Steven Mackay adds a nasty edge     to the album's second side, blazing right along with the rest of the band to     create a texture that sounds exactly like the album cover-- Iggy tossed     in a flaming sea, possibly hell. The record's first half is somewhat tamer,     with the heavy boogie of ""Down on the Street"" and the paranoid snarl of     ""T.V. Eye"", where the band plays with deadly efficiency behind Iggy's     demented vocal. Iggy actually captures the feel of the whole record in the     opening line of ""1970"": ""Out of my mind on a Saturday night.""</i></p>
<p>The reissues each add a whole disc of rarities, though hardcore fans will     already know the <i>Fun House extras from the 1970 boxed set, which is now out     of print. On </i><i>Stooges</i>, it's basically alternate mixes and extended versions,     while on <i>Fun House it's primarily outtakes, but given the volatility of the     material on that album, there's quite a bit of variation from version to     version. That said, none of the out-takes are particularly revelatory     outside a twisted, distended, sax-soaked version of ""1970"", and most casual     listeners will probably not spin disc two of either set more than once or     twice. </i><i>Fun House</i> does include two songs that didn't make the album, but     it's hard to see where either the ravaged blues of ""Slide (Slidin' the     Blues)"" or ""Lost in the Future"" would have fit without destroying the     record's momentum. That said, both songs offer a chance to hear more of     Mackay's sax playing and give a glimpse toward what the band might have     sounded like if a lineup had solidified with him in it.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that these are two of the most important     signposts on the way to the punk explosion, and that any rock fan with a     sense of history owes it to themselves to check them out if they haven't     already. What's often lost as we place them in the canon, though, is the     fact that both albums sound incredibly good today on their own terms, raw     and immediate and dripping with an aggression that's rarely been rivaled.</p></div>"|11842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11842-the-stooges-fun-house/|9.4|Joe Tangari

On <em>Kore Ga Mayaku Da</em>-- their first U.S. release following a handful of self-released recordings in Japan-- it isn't difficult to hear why their ascent has been so rapid. Though their national origin will surely prompt impulsive comparisons to Melt Banana or early Boredoms, there's something entirely unique going on within Afrirampo's free-form, primal garage-stomps. And on this album they join such acts as Magik Markers or Angelblood out beyond the farthest streetlight of rock's untamed outskirts, where one wrong turn can plunk you directly into the foreboding, impassable wilderness.</p><p>
    
    Afrirampo (the name translates loosely yet accurately to ""naked rock"") is comprised of guitarist Oni and drummer Pikachu, both of whom add wild, lustful vocals that occasionally reach pitches of near-cartoonish intensity. With this denuded instrumental attack the duo recasts the trashy, minimalist garage-rock of groups like the Oblivians or Cheater Slicks into decidedly more personalized abstract forms, using open-ended song structures and free-spirited improvisation to create a mercurial strain of fuzzed-out thunder.</p><p>
    
    While the duo's spare approach necessarily amplifies the relative weight of each individual element of their music, on <em>Kore Ga Mayaku Da</em> it is Oni's guitar that proves to be the group's most indispensable weapon. At a time when noteworthy rock guitarists seem to be in uncommonly short supply, Oni's work here consistently astonishes without being overtly flashy. One minute she sounds to be channeling Johnny Thunders, the next it's a leopard skin-clad Derek Bailey, as throughout the album she bursts enthusiastically from episode-to-episode with a slippery, off-the-cuff grace that suggests that she's not always wholly aware of what her fingers are planning to do next. Behind the drumkit, Pikachu acquits herself as well, keeping pace with-- if not actually anticipating-- Oni's every frantic lane change.</p><p>
    
    The duo certainly waste no time getting down to the nitty-gritty on their ecstatic 13-minute opening gush ""I Did Are,"" a surprisingly metallic, free-flowing epic that changes course roughly every 45 seconds, including an extended mid-song breakdown of dizzy vocalizing and guitar-string chicken clucks. Things get slightly less complicated on blistering tracks like the onomatopoetic ""O"" or the crazed-scales of ""Kairaku Do Re Mi"", while on quieter numbers like ""On Ska to Paar Ya"" or the erotically-charged plea ""Want You"", the duo reveal an unsuspected Jamaican influence, inflecting these songs with languid, echo-heavy dub effects and erstwhile island rhythms. It's never long, however, before Afrirampo are again off and running, joyfully veering to the cusp of feral, white-hot noise, as they drag their songs kicking and screaming towards distant untold possibilities.</p></div>"|480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/480-kore-ga-mayaku-da/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

As
    a matter of fact, if I were in a band, and the release for the new
    joint said something like, ""Gee, you know, these guys, I'd love to say
    they're the bee's knees, but they're not there yet, though they're trying
    really hard,"" I'd seriously consider gee-you-knowing the
    soon-to-be-former PR guy. Hyperbole and spit-shining and working the
    angles is part of the racket.</p><p>
    
    That said-- why oh why do you, press person for the Visible Men, deign
    to promote an album full of perfectly OK piano-centric poptones by
    mentioning that two of the band members used to be in the Cherry Poppin'
    Daddies when that information has squat to do with the music being
    pimped out? I mean, it's great for me, because doing the ""they <em>used</em> to
    be That Other Group cashing in on the swing revival, but now they're
    making <em>real</em> music"" type-jive fills my word count quota and saves me the
    trouble of getting overly blah-blah about the record. The ""look how far
    we've come"" trick only works when selling cigarettes to women, or
    selling solo records to folks allergic to music not written or played by
    the singer.</p><p>
    
    And then there are the hip reference points. XTC. Squeeze. Elvis
    Costello. Sure, parlay the recent fascination with old-school new wave
    into some beneficial cachet for your group, even if the lovelorn nervy
    cleverness of those folks has the most minimal bearing on what's going
    on. As if one shining moment of Steve Neive emulation qualifies the
    group to shout out the Attractions. As if typing ""Ben Folds"" or
    ""Fastball"" into Word will bring down some forsaken cred-killing plague
    upon the heads of former members of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies. As if
    ""word play"" involving ""all this information"" / ""get in formation"", or
    rhymes like, ""It's why we drink/ Or so I think"" is clever. And as if
    including a six-minute snoozefest like ""Pinnochio"" (guess what the hook
    is?) is a good idea.</p><p>
    
    Those of you not agreeing with my assessment, feel free to direct the
    usual ""go fluff a brick with your head"" appreciation at my inbox, which
    I'll happily ignore. I like a lot of what's happening here, at least when the tempos are peppy. Having the range to flip
    from jammy organ blues to zippy doo-dah to sad balladry (in the same
    track!) is always good. And I'm a sucker for downtrodden love-sucks
    sentiments sung in a plaintive voice, even if the stew's a
    smidge overcooked at times. But there is a huge disconnect between what
    was promised and what ended up in my iPod. All I'm looking for is a
    little accountability and honesty. And maybe a little more ""Uncle
    Walter"" or ""Underground"". You know-- for kids.</p></div>"|8541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8541-love-30/|5.2|David Raposa

    (like a glue-sniffing Atom and His Package) are not without charm.
    Plenty of catchy Devo-meets-the-Ramones melodies and incredulous yuks in the first 10 tracks of his ""75-minute party-rock concept album."" ""I'm Not a Scoreboard"" finds Gene wrapping his
    adenoidal voice around boneheaded puns in the grand old tradition of
    ""Are You Jimmy Ray?"". ""People always ask me, what's the score?/ I'm
    not a scoreboard/ I'm not the sports page."" ""Come Party With Me""
    seems to parody Sugar Ray's ""Every Morning"", outdoing the sluggish
    frat-ska of the original. The squelchy rock-rap number, ""Rockin' Your
    Bones"", will tickle people who find rap inherently funny (P.S.-- I hate
    you), and what's not to like about ""Mr. President"", a revisionist
    presidential assassination narrative? The Postal Service got away with
    it, and they were serious!</p><p>
    
    After a mere 20 tracks, thematic repetition creeps in: Gene likes to
    party, and invites us to party with him. There's the hopped-up surf
    rock (like the Beach Boys' ""Fun Fun Fun"" on crank) of ""Shut Me in a
    Cage"" and the circus synths of ""Hey (You Wanna Party with Gene
    Defcon?)"". ""All the teenage girls and boys are on hard drugs/ All the
    twenty-something alcoholics look so smug/ The lesbian cyber-chicks
    are having crazy sex/ I raise my glass to all these party people with
    respect."" All right dude. I get it. We've been going in sets of 10,
    but it's time to sprint. Meet me at track 40.</p><p>
    
    Track 40, ""My Girlfriend Is a Mexican"". I am not well. In the tradition
    of all parties that last too long, I've been in a walking blackout for
    the last 20 tracks. And there are still six more! Let's see,
    what's next...""I Love You More Than Any Pasta-Fed Ding-Dong"". Peg me as a joyless Morlock
    if you want-- if this is joy, I'll take clinical depression. </p></div>"|2258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2258-throw-up-die/|4.8|Brian Howe

The insert from their second CD features three carefully sloppy young men, their eyes just peeking out behind stray locks, looking contemplative, chugging beer, doing headstands, playing guitar while crowd surfing, and generally bathing themselves in empty singnifiers. An album of candid songs from in front of the family fireplace seems unlikely.</p><p>
    
    None of that matters as long as they've got the tunes, though, right? They don't. The Cribs put all their cards on the table before the first track is finished. ""Hey Scenesters"" features good ol' staccato Telecaster angular-ass guitars, a danceable beat, and a shout-along hook, not to mention an echo-drenched vocal counter-melody for maximum catchiness. Singer Ryan Jarman doesn't try too hard, of course, lest the band reveal some trace of passion or ability. Maybe they think deriding ""scenesters"" in the lyrics to such a derivative song is a clever bit of irony; it's actually just transparent, and it doesn't let them off the hook.</p><p>
    
    Or maybe it's lost on them entirely. I'd believe it, given the naive mimcry of some of these songs. The Strokes imitations are frequent and blatant, though they bring a cheeky amateurism to their priacy, if nothing else. ""I'm Alright Me"" and ""We Can No Longer Cheat You"" are all slurred vowels and trebley downstrokes, but with the swaying, off-key chorus of ""We Can No Longer Cheat You"", it's difficult to criticise because it's difficult to even take seriously. The title track, however, borrows so liberally-- right down to the solo not-a-drum-machine drumming before each verse-- it's hard to imagine a live audience not laughing out loud.</p><p>
    
    The band seems more at home playing for punters and having them shouting in the background, with woozy bloke-rock like ""Martell"" and ""It Was Only Love"" hitting more of a comfort zone. Their sloppy pub-rock is less deserving of ire, and yet no more deserving of a listen.</p></div>"|1816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1816-the-new-fellas/|3.0|Jason Crock

    one), 
    and spotted a thread entitled ""Superpitcher Live In NYC"". Turns out he 
    travelled over from Germany to DJ recently. And the general consensus 
    seems 
    to be that he was good. But we've seen him play better.</p><p>
    How jaded we've all become in the last 48 months! In 2001, 
    Kompakt's 
    10 or so CD releases were barely distributed in the U.S., their roster 
    was a 
    mystery (Michael Mayer? Jürgen Paape? Dettinger??) to anyone not 
    paying close attention to post-Basic Channel German techno, 
    and seeing any of them live in the U.S. (if they even played 
    live) 
    would be akin to catching a baby dinosaur walking down Avenue B at 
    dusk. 
    Some of those CD's weren't even that good! Will anyone stand up to make 
    an 
    argument for the ugly, blurting grooves of the first <em>Schaffelfieber</em> 
    comp? Or 
    the flat, gray Chain Reaction cribbing of Jonas Bering?</p><p>
    Of course, now Kompakt is huge: adopted by prog house and big-room 
    trance 
    jocks, hipster shorthand for techno in the 21st century, Mayer and crew 
    regularly touring the planet. They were in <em>Spin</em> for chrissakes! 2001 
    was 
    when that turn from anonymity to (a kind of) superstardom began, with 
    the 
    release of the <i>Total 3</i> compilation. A mixture of disarmingly catchy 
    vocal 
    cuts and better-than average-intrumentals, <em>Total 3 married techno and 
    trance 
    maneuvers to the kind of wistful, melancholic, or dark vibes that rock 
    fans 
    gravitate to in electronic music. (Cf. Aphex, Boards of Canada...hell, 
    nearly 
    all of the melodic side of IDM.)</em></p><p>
    By 2002, you could safely call Kompakt one of the most exciting labels 
    in 
    the world. For 12 months they knocked out one epochal record after 
    another, be it artist LPs (Thomas Fehlmann, Closer Musik, Justus 
    Köhncke, 
    Kaito), DJ mixes (<em>Friends, </em><em>Immer), or comps (</em><em>Total 4). The streak began 
    to 
    slow by 2003 when <i>Total 5</i> debuted to middling reviews and, following a 
    string of mediocre releases, its best record (Michael Mayer's </em><em>Fabric 
    13 mix) wasn't even released on the label. 2004 saw its profile at the 
    highest, with blanket press coverage and major U.S. DJ 
    gigs for 
    the Kompakt all-stars. It was also the label's weakest year on CD, with 
    disappointing artist albums from Michael Mayer and Superpitcher, as 
    well as 
    the bloated, unrealized promise of </em><em>Kompakt 100.</em></p><p>
    So it is with some natural trepidation that I approach <em>Total 6, a 
    2xCD (uh-oh) collection of recent singles and exclusives. I grumbled 
    and 
    griped too, began to claim that they were being eclipsed by newer 
    labels 
    like Areal or Get Physical. I mean, obviously the zeitgeist has moved 
    on, 
    right? Microhouse is dead and everyone wants electro-house. Well, 
    today I 
    am a choad, because </em><em>Total 6 is the best in the series since </em><em>3</em>. Kompakt was never really microhouse anyway; leave that to 
    your 
    clicking, popping Perlons and Akufens. If any German house label was 
    ""electro-house"" it was Kompakt. Just listen to Köhncke's ""2 After 909"", 
    Closer Musik's ""You Don't Know Me"", or all those <em>basslines</em>. It's 
    just 
    that while they were electro-house they were a dozen other things 
    besides.</p><p>
    Disc one contains all the ""hits,"" from that alternate universe where 
    Justus 
    Köhncke is as big a star as 50 Cent (or at least Marvin Hamlisch). 
    Speaking 
    of which, he and Andreas Dorau's ""Durch Die Nacht (Geiger Mix)"" starts 
    off as 
    typical kozmik synth squiggle nonsense before itchy cocaine guitars, 
    sweeping strings, and a faded vocal from an old record turn it into 
    disco 
    rescued from the Salvation Army. And his ""Krieg"" is fairly pro-forma 
    electro-house, elevated by the trancey synth pad breakdown halfway 
    through 
    that burps and farts into a gurning, unresolved bleep-fest. ""I Built 
    This 
    City"" is probably the track that's received the most press so far, a 
    Michael 
    Mayer remix of a Baxendale (!) track. It opens with percussion that 
    sounds 
    like oil popping off a hot pan and chugging trance synths. The vocal is 
    the most camp the label has ever touched (with some pretty stiff 
    competition). The drums begin to speed up as an electro bassline 
    bullies its 
    way to the front of the mix. It finally bursts into a falsetto that 
    makes 
    Jake Shears sound like Phil Anselmo, designed to cause shirt-stripping 
    amyl-nitrate hysteria on the floor. You will either love it or hate it.</p><p>
    Rex the Dog's ""I Look Into Mid-Air"" has thwacking drums and farty, 
    belching 
    glitch-pops, like Mr. Oizo spiked with laxative, before wooshing 
    keyboards arcs it towards 
    the 
    titular location. Tocotronic's ""Pure Vernunft Darf Niemals Siegen 
    (Superpitcher/Wassermann Single Mix)"" feels like a <em>Re-Animator</em> lab 
    mistake 
    of Factory-style gothic indie and chugging house. 
    The vocals veer uncomfortably into near-hysteria, backed by jacking 
    drums, 
    spidery chords, ""A Forest""-like bass, and a desperately strummed 
    guitar. The 
    MFA's ""The Difference It Makes"", on the other hand, is as comforting as 
    if 
    the whole track was trapped in a snow globe, a steady pounding beat 
    with a 
    mercury misting of hi-hat, deep bass, and more trancey builds. Then a 
    plaintive voice begins to repeat the title, so tremulous with reverb 
    that it 
    sounds barely human, chopped into doll parts, before it all drops away 
    and a 
    grinding drone chord clears the way for the beat to kick back in.</p><p>
    Disc 2 is less showy, more clubby. Superpitcher's ""Tell Me About It"" 
    drops 
    deliberate, Arvo Part-esque piano clusters into a mid-tempo groove 
    centered 
    on a steady shaker as a female voice and cymbal rushes snake across the 
    stereo field. Michael Mayer and Mattias Aguayo's ""Slow"" is actually a 
    mash-up of Kylie's ""Slow"" (recited by Dieter from ""Sprockets"") with 
    Mayer's 
    ""Lovefood"", that's funny for a spin or two but never really gels. 
    SCSI-9's 
    ""Mini"" is late summer/early fall pressed into grooves, fireflies 
    buzzing in 
    your ears, a deeply dippy bassline, hazy tape loops, and melodies like 
    water 
    tower safety lights blinking on and off.</p><p>
    These are of course the 
    ""special"" 
    tracks, the ones which have a little something extra (vocals, samples, 
    weirdness) on top of their grooves. Across an expanse of 160 minutes, 
    there 
    are plenty of tracks working a handful of materials into (slightly) new 
    shapes. Dub echo and reverb. 
    Sparkling one-note melody trails. Buzzing analogue basslines. Clicks, 
    pop, 
    plorts, plurps, and burps. Preset strings and j-j-jacking drums. The 
    more 
    amazing thing is that the bulk of this ""faceless techno bollocks"" is, 
    in 
    complete defiance of most rules about double CD collections, quite 
    good. 
    (But what would a dance record be without a few tracks that confused 
    ""repetitious"" with ""hypnotic."")</p><p>
    2005 has been a healthy, steady year for the label. There have been 
    good-to-great releases from Justus Köhncke, Ferenc, DJ Koze, and 
    Superpitcher, which doesn't even begin to touch on the singles output. 
    (Still the lifeblood of any dance label.) Now, with <i>Total 6 
    emphatically 
    not sucking, is it safe to say Kompakt is ""back""? It seems a bit crude 
    to 
    apply rock journalism tropes and hype mongering to a label whose stated 
    ambition is to prove that minimal techno is a 4-life thing, who will 
    probably be plugging away long after the media has seemingly lost their 
    contact info. Suffice to say they survived their brush with fame and 
    came 
    out tougher, if not quite so lustrous, something all too few labels can 
    boast after being put under those lamps.</i></p></div>"|2021.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2021-total-6/|8.7|Jess Harvell

The band are certainly prone to slow, ""Part Chimp Fear Satan"" guitar squalls, but where those are emotional crescendos for some bands, they're just interludes between the highlights of <em>I Am Come</em>. ""Bakahatsu"" is the prototypical grinding opener. Standing squarely under Mogwai's shadow for 90 seconds, it's just buildup for the sludgy sweet tooth of album peak ""War Machine"". Ringing guitars march forward despite being interrupted by a distorted gallop every four bars, with a melody and rhythm no less effective for their simplicity.</p><p>
    
    Volume is Part Chimp's primary instrument, and while brief respites like ""Bubbles"" are welcome and needed, quiet moments are the enemy. Clean guitar chords creep quietly past, waiting for the next bomb to fall. Sometimes they're safe for close to an entire song (""Bubbles""), sometimes there's only a few seconds before the next attack (""Bring Back the Sound""). The orderly assault of ""War Machine"" gives way to the steady, relentless hammering of ""Hello Bastards"", after which ""Bubbles"" is a trickle in comparison. By the time the Stooges-nodding ""Punishment Ride"" finishes and ""Bring Back the Ride"" is underway, the fuzz pedals are planting their flag.</p><p>
    
    ""Punishment Ride"" is one of the few songs following the quiet/loud dynamic; most just go from loud to louder. ""Dr. Horse Part Two"" is a solid wall of heavy psychedelia, followed up by the reckless pace of ""Fasto"". The bent notes of the title track sound like support beams breaking under the weight of the song's monolithic blues riffing, and ""30 Billion People"" sounds something like Black Sabbath covering Pavement's ""Two States"", boiling over with layers of distortion and erratic guitar solos.</p><p>
    
    Is it any different than last year's <em>Chart Pimp</em>? Is the loudness louder, is the noise nosier? Well, yes and yes, not to mention tighter songs and the band getting a deeper grasp of their dynamics (meaning the few seconds of calm are more concise and effective). Hard to believe that with a sound that's all about overkill, not one note is wasted. These songs are as tight as any pop groups, just played with ear-splitting volume. I wouldn't call it unpredictable, but <em>I Am Come</em> has slight variety amongst the chaos, anchored by a canny sense of pacing. Add that to the 20-ton hooks of ""War Machine"" and ""Bring Back the Sound"", you've got a noteworthy sophomore record-- and, most importantly, one that rocks.</p></div>"|6582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6582-i-am-come/|7.9|Jason Crock

    with Animal Collective, this 33-minute collage stitches together four
    live shows recorded between mid-2003 and early 2004 at the Knitting Factory,
    North Six, Passerby, and the Cooler (RIP), and includes an additional 30-plus
    minutes of live video footage. Don't expect Bruce Springsteen's <em>Live
    1975-85: </em><em>Hillulah isn't a straight-up archive. Treating the recordings like found material, drummer Tim Dewitt
    spliced and shifted hours of two-track audio into these extensions,
    and like most of GGD's best work, the rhythmic incantations are
    hermetically removed from the everyday, so cheers and other live-album
    trappings are minimal.</em></p><p>
    
    Stylistically, the four pieces phase through and reintroduce sounds contained on each
    GGD release: broken dub, colorful piano embellishments, blurred
    calypso, oxygen-deprived hiccups, island wattles, prismatic fractures,
    Fluxus sutures, earthy drum circles, etc. At one point Lizzy Bougatsos
    dives into a cavern after engaging in Tourette's syndrome howls with
    an unspecified male, astride electronic bleeps, drumstick rattles, and
    guitar blooms. Elsewhere, guest vocalist Sean Reveron of A
    Gun Called Tension shouts post-punk vitriol alongside boorish
    implosion. Occasionally, bits of instrumentation are trashed (like a
    dropped second), offering the feel of a loop (or lope). Percussion
    accelerates, tapping a constant, techno-friendly palpitation.</p><p>
    
    For genealogy completists, <em>Hillulah glances outside the studio and
    practice room, suggesting multiple bridges between 2001's <i>Revival of
    the Shittest</i>, the self-titled Fusetron LP, and </em><em>God's Money.
    Personally, I like that it was compiled over just three days, because
    as one might expect, the transitions are at times sketchy, the
    movements not entirely in-synch. Looseness is its charm. In that
    sense, </em><em>Hillulah supplies imperfect (and pretty) off-the-cuff glances
    at Gang Gang Dance's past, but realistically speaking, it's a
    documentation for diehards, not curiosity seekers.</em></p></div>"|3649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3649-hillulah/|6.9|Brandon Stosuy

I first heard this stuff at the now-defunct Weekend Records and Soap, which was co-owned by Magas, another electro guy with some rockabilly attitude. As something to walk off the street and <em>into</em>, it didn't sound half bad. The chances, though, of your wanting to bring it home with you? Slim. This, after all, is the sound of someone asking you to delight in the sheer dirty spazz of what he's doing-- an opportunity that nowadays only gets offered to noise acts with enough no-fun attitude to make the whole thing seem like ""art."" Strike two: The sort of camp, yowling rock'n'roll schtick so many horrible American acts fall in love with, the one we should have let drop well before Jon Spencer came around. Electronicat at least has the excuse of being French, which explains why this album contains a brief impersonation of Jerry Lewis instead of Jerry <em>Lee</em> Lewis.</p><p>
    
    His other excuse is the album is kinda fun. Its intentions are made clear by the grotty digital sound, which is basically the electronic equivalent of the four-track in the basement-- this weird laptop reversal where sounding too clean makes the whole thing sound awfully dirty. It's hard to think of a better context for all the just-for-fun old-rock quoting he does on here. When ""Dans la Bois"" kicks off with a psychdelic-Stones pastiche, low-rent French Jagger posing over low-rent guitar and machine stomp, it's not so difficult to get into. Same goes for the rockabilly swing on ""Wap Doowop"" and the fuzzed-out Bo Diddley beat on ""Savage Cat"", if not the modified Deep Purple riff on ""Mummy Cat""; at best, they wind up doing the same thing Junior Senior did to Bob Dylan on one of their album tracks, revving up old tropes into some sleazy drum-machined present.</p><p>
    
    Still, an excuse is an excuse, and there comes the point where you realize you're chuckling at some of his jackaround tracks more than you're actually feeling them. There comes the point where you remember that Stereo Total could do plenty of this pastiche and make it sound a lot sharper, and there comes the point where you remember that you could get better sleazoid camp vibes off of the Cramps. There's some satisfying stomp-and-wail up in her-- and some lovable cut-ups on ""The Smell of Danger"", and some home-recording weirdism that could nearly slot into <em>God Ween Satan</em>-- but it's all going to need to get a lot better-developed if it's every going to fly.</p></div>"|2894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2894-voodoo-man/|5.1|Nitsuh Abebe

Okay, so the lawyer part's not the most conventional detour but true to form, Pedersen's a real Atticus Finch on
    <em>When We Break</em>, the band's second full-length. Rather than blubbering, teen drama-style bellyaching, Pedersen constructs a coherent argument supported by facts and analysis when bitching about his white suburban life.</p><p>
    
    Exhibit A: On opener ""Prevent the World"", the defendant hates being a corporate lawyer in Omaha, and wishes to join rock band: ""I'm stuck in a basement world/ Where even if I try to make rock my living, it wouldn't coincide/ So how do I reconcile the success of life/ With the rational urges?"" Call it sophisticated emo brought to us by
    ""Law and Order"", but the distinctions between a petulant, disillusioned teen and an argumentative trial attorney can oftentimes merge.</p><p>
    At this time, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to direct you to Exhibit B, Mr. Pedersen's impeccably efficient yet busy punk-pop orchestration. Of course, in order to properly analyze this evidence, the court should be familiar with Exhibits C, D and E-- Fugazi, Sparta and Sum-41, respectively. Criteria's sound follows the devolution from Exhibit C to D, flirting with E at its fluffiest, particularly on anthems ""Good Luck"" and ""Ride the Snake"". Further investigation reveals Pedersen's biggest songwriting glitch: Take away the octave riffs and dropped-d power chords, and Criteria suddenly becomes severely handicapped, a weakness the band goes at great lengths to dissemble using jagged math-rock riffs or occasional attempts at crafting ""atmosphere.""</p><p>
    Instruments aside, Pederson's filibuster vocals ultimately hamstring
    <em>When We Break</em>. The guy tries to squeeze a court case's worth of litigiousness into one album, leaving little space to breathe musically. Melodies continuously encroach on each other, colliding before a stable hook can be realized. Thus, we get into an issue where the vocalist places his own beefs, or EMOtions, ahead of the music. Not to go into a semantics/systematics debate over Criteria's classification as ""emo"" versus some delicacy label like ""post-hardcore,"" but the latter term has become the ""Freedom Fries"" doublespeak du jour for defenders of the sound. Saddle Creek tested the threshold for this stuff with Cursive, of which Pedersen was formerly a member, but that group threw in enough fresh ideas to quash, or at least numb, most listeners' prejudices. Sadly, Criteria, if anything, only justifies the emo stigma, and I have about 36 minutes of taped evidence to back that charge.</p></div>"|1815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1815-when-we-break/|4.8|Adam Moerder

That track, after all, was tight: Chunky-funky drums, hot'n'slippery discoid bass, and one long lascivious whisper of a vocal. The spangly acoustic guitar and unselfconscious cheese-out solo might have made it sound like Phoenix-- except Phoenix are always asking you to get on the dance floor and smile and be happy, whereas Geiger seemed to be asking you to come join him in the men's room for a couple minutes. He sounds like he's asking the same question on this album, sure. But strings of mediocre tracks and wild stylistic shifts-- two things that just don't sit well together-- make you want to tell him you'll meet him in there in five minutes, and then run out to look for a cab.</p><p>
    
    For one thing, the guy's got a terrible opening line, something only notches above carrying a comedy ""Booty Inspector"" badge. ""Hot Body"" is five-plus minutes of nicely formed but entirely unremarkable house tick, background music for a weirdly boring lounge, layered with an interview from some web-porn woman; it's almost as if he realized the first four minutes weren't very interesting, and fired up his web browser to find some bit of audio that might distract you. So you try to brush him off, but he comes back with stronger material: ""Bless the Lord"" has some wonderfully sweaty slow burn, and it showcases Geiger's stoned-seducer voice better than anything else on here. After that one, you might even be willing to tell him your real name-- only then he gets cocky and offers you an ""Interlude"". And here you were, hoping ""Hot Body"" was meant to be the throwaway intro.</p><p>
    
    Here you were, too, thinking Geiger might play to his slick-funk strengths. ""Sunday"" revs them up into a decent rocker, running from disco verse to fuzzed-out chorus like a kitsch-less version of Electric Six's ""Danger! High Voltage""-- (okay, my name's Nitsuh, you're Geiger? Alex Geiger?)-- but then suddenly ""Love Song"" is some horribly dippy acoustic folk, with a complete mess of a pseudo-psychedelic interlude. Who <em>is</em> this guy, anyway?</p><p>
    
    Oh, you'll never know; the swift recovery on ""Cocain-E"" isn't going to carry you through. There's something nice in the way ""Five Years"" moves from the old sweaty groove to interludes that are basically indie-rock drama, and ""Studio Star"" is half-good at spreading Cheez-Whizz funk over itself, Alan Braxe-style. But there's just nothing here that's got much of a shot at grabbing you-- just ongoing slow-house strut and lascivious vocal and the strange sense that you're listening to the collected outtakes and demos from some much-better record. Plus another painful folk number. About animals. Something to sing when, 30 minutes later, he comes out of the restroom looking for you and finds that you're long gone. </p></div>"|3678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3678-out-of-tune/|5.5|Nitsuh Abebe

Elverum & Sun']|2005-08-15 00:00:00|2005|2016-06-11 20:55:33.616633|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".ksvurym1og.1.6:0.1.0.$5596/=1$5596.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p><em>No Flashlight</em>, Mount Eerie's first studio album, comes with a huge poster/map/<em>Farmer's Almanac thing, which is meant to help explain the music and look pretty doing so. It isn't the first time Phil Elverum, the band's inscrutable leader, has written an album with grandiose narrative threads and laid them out in liner notes. </em><em>Mount Eerie, his last record as Microphones, tackled-- in language that was difficult despite its puerile concision-- the Sun, Solar System, and Universe, plus ol' Mount Eerie herself.</em></p><p>
    
    But while that record came with an attractive but relatively modest fold-out poster (all black ink printed on diaphanous wax paper), <em>No Flashlight</em>'s visual companion is a freaking atlas, complete with beatific photographs and Elverum's wobbly prose. Window-dressing on an epic scale, its inclusion sends the message that understanding is required to access enjoyment.</p><p>
<em>No Flashlight</em> is the most musically undistinguished Elverum-related project to date, including Microphones' intractable early albums and Mount Eerie's shoddily-recorded live and tour-only material. The album's <em>laissez-faire production fails to anchor its quaint, melody-allergic songs. In turn, Elverum's retiring vocals float to the top, which is a horrible place for them. It's a textural trainwreck that sabotages the music before one can even focus on lyrics or guitar lines. So the distraction of an expository outpouring makes sense.</em></p><p>
    
    Demanding listener input-- as Elverum does here by not-so-subtly inviting us to ponder him-- isn't a bad thing. But courting ears with such esoteric hooey is disingenuous and annoying. Elverum used to be able to hide his most solipsistic moments behind ambitious music; he now makes boring music that is premised on his persona and the explanation thereof. This is theoretical music in a whole 'nother sense: Largely untechnical and musically staid, the meaning lies not in the notes, not in the colossal liner spread, and not even really in the words, which are feebly expository and largely unsatisfying. The value, we are led to believe, lies somewhere apart from the music.</p><p>
    
    Elverum sings in an quietly anguished voice-- like a cult leader, it's only as powerful as what he puts behind it. Here, Elverum's a lone sojourner; Mount Eerie's gray performances put the diffident singer cruelly in the foreground, where he founders.</p><p>
    
    Has his voice changed? Hardly. Coy, lethargic, and almost drunkenly tuneless, this is the same guy from Microphones. Only now he has nowhere to hide. On <em>""The Glow,"" pt. 2</em>, his former band's penultimate and best album, Elverum wrapped inner-sanctum ruminations in warm, whooshing instrumentals, rich in assertive melodies. <em>No Flashlight</em> is comparatively ascetic. Melodies are sparse but the music isn't quite minimal. Opener ""I Know No One"" subdues a plaintive guitar line in accordion swell and excessive, frequently mic-clipping percussion. Unaccessorized, the six-string would sound brilliant-- a counterpoint to Elverum's ugly-beautiful vox-- but the line is swallowed up.</p><p>
    
    On ""How?"", notes cluster in disorganized spurts, while the 1st Mt. Eerie Tabernacle Hummers fill the voids with their closed-lip sounds. ""Stop Singing"" opens beautifully-- flashes of guitar tussle with clarinet vapors, evoking an unlikely forebear: Talk Talk. But it's just an intro, soon to be supplanted by a bass/drums vamp that dispenses with lo-fi's anchoring warmth, keeping the shabbiness.</p><p>
    
    Elverum previously espoused a very un-singer/songwriterly preference for sound over persona. But <em>No Flashlight</em> is quick to dispel any confusion around its focus. ""I Know No One"" drops the mission statement bombshell: ""Knowing no one understands these songs/ I try to sing them clearer/ Even though no one has ever asked, 'What does Mount Eerie mean?'"". The best tracks are those on which he's mollified: by <em>Glow</em>-sized guitar wash and skittish drums on ""The Moan"", or gusty tuba and a second-line beat on ""The Universe Is Shown"".</p><p>
    
    I revisited my Microphones LPs, which I haven't spun regularly for a couple years, to see if evolving tastes, globalization, or something else isn't to blame for my indifference to Mount Eerie. Verdict? <em>""The Glow,"" pt. 2 is still fantastic; <i>It Was Hot We Stayed in the Water</i> still very good; and <i>Mt. Eerie</i></em> still trippy as hell. If the forthcoming <em>Singers</em> is any indication, Mount Eerie got some moxy in 'em yet. But your enjoyment of <em>No Flashlight</em> will depend on your interest in Phil Elverum, and whether or not you've the patience to wade through this sonic tub-full of Jonestown juice. Once you find him, he's just as fetchingly impossible. But when the pleasure is this conditional, it becomes fuzzy what all the fuss is over.</p></div>"|5596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5596-no-flashlight/|5.0|Sam Ubl

    post-punk herky-jerky. To be sure, native sons Field Music have much
    in common with the Mackems that came before-- not least their members,
    who include one former Futurehead plus a current Maxïmo Park drummer--
    but rather than assail us with angularity, the
    region's latest exports aptly prefer prettiness. Indeed, ""You're So
    Pretty"", their 12-song, 38-minute debut's art-pop finale, is the
    album's best track, and also its buzzing, ornamented,
    just-too-brief-enough synecdoche.</p><p>
    That song, like the album's other epiphanies, is a sparkling construct of whirring guitars, eccentric percussion,
    windmill-tilting bass, and Andrew Moore's piano embellishments. Dual
    lead vocalists Peter and David Brewis swap quixotic, often-falsetto
    harmonies as indebted to <em>Pet Sounds</em> as to ""Hounds of Love"". The
    lyrics tend toward the commonplace, which if not beside the point
    pretty much <em>is</em> the point: ""You're so pretty/ I could talk to
    you all night"", chime the Brothers Brewis, their sweet-nothings
    granted the wings of soaring melody.</p><p>
    Second single ""You Can Decide"" is the band's most immediately compelling
    track, with copious oohing, spastic handclaps, and eloquently
    stuttering chorus: ""So if you know, you know, you know/ Let me.""
    ""Got to Write a Letter"" benefits from slippery
    acoustic guitars and fairly sharp wordplay, though none as adroit as
    ""I've given up thinking"" from the album's rare sad song, the
    still-sun-dappled ""Like When You Meet Someone Else"". Opener ""If Only
    the Moon Were Up"" introduces a smattering of <em>Revolver</em> horn
    oompahs and GeoHa guitarisms ca. <em>Abbey Road</em>. I still say
    stupendous first single ""Shorter Shorter"" was, true to its name, the
    latter album's flip-side shortened, haunted and harried by imminent
    mortality. Meanwhile, the band's self-consciously complex, maximalist
    arrangements and Sparks- or even Yes-like vocal heights call up that
    suddenly-not-dirty (if prefixed with ""hyper"") word: prog. I'm just
    saying.</p><p>
    After their first two singles, it's hard not to be
    let down by good-enoughs like the ambitious, briefly cacophonous ""Tell
    Me Keep Me"", string-laden ""Luck Is a Fine Thing"", and staccato,
    saxophone-blearing ""17"". More ephemeral than Clor, more cerebral than
    the Rakes, Field Music has, like the Magic Numbers, fashioned a
    distinctive voice and near-perfect arrangements, but the songs hint at
    greatness nearly as often as they achieve it. Pretty is pretty nice,
    but the promise of true beauty makes tough critics of us all.</p></div>"|3344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3344-field-music/|7.6|Marc Hogan

At its frequent best, </em><em>Aw Come Aw Wry successfully fuses indie Americana atmospherics with gospel and country melodies to achieve a striking and esoteric sound.</em></p><p>
    
    Punctuated throughout by horns that sound like Stax hits by way of <em>In An Aeroplane Over the Sea (the all-too-obvious, but completely un-ignorable, comparison), </em><em>Aw Come Aw Wry is loosely organized around three short versions of the title track, each one interpreted differently. ""Aw Come Aw Wry #5"" and ""#3"" have slow tempos, soft, enveloping sounds, and dripping pedal steel that might be called bootgazer, and the slightly more animated ""#6"" joins an elementary drumbeat (that is quite possibly the same one from the Homestar Runner theme) to a gospel clap-along.</em></p><p>
    
    The title tracks act like title cards on the album, and from them Houck derives the sounds and themes that color the more traditional tracks. The pots-and-pans percussion and strangled guitar riff of ""I Am a Full Grown Man (I Will Lay in the Grass All Day)"" are introduced one track earlier in ""<em>Aw Come Aw Wry #6"", and the patient momentum of ""Joe Tex, These Taming Blues"" is initiated in ""#5"". Their shared mournful melody-- four descending notes: the first long, the rest short-- even appears on ""Lost Name"", with its possessed legion of speaking voices. The function of these interstitials is as practical as it is aesthetic: they not only give </em><em>Aw Come Aw Wry its shape, but hold the album together even when it begins to drag towards the end on two versions of ""Endless"" (not to mention the 19 minutes of road and thunder noise that closes the album, as if to prove some sort of backporch authenticity).</em></p><p>
    
    As a result, the songs sound of a piece, suffused with a wobbly, warbly regret that makes each one sound like a head-hanging apology to a particular someone. In fact, ""South (of America)"", with its cinematic chorale of backing voices and its pledge of self-imposed exile, fashions a refrain from a wounded mea culpa: ""Babe, I'm sorry/ I'm sorry/ I am"", Houck sings, as if slowly backing away. It helps that he delivers these songs in a wounded voice that sounds like a dried cornhusk, papery thin and crackling. His odd phrasing suggests a rougher Eef Barzalay, and at times his voice sounds too weak for the material, but that distance between Houck's vocal capacity and the demands of ""Not a Heel"" and ""Dead Heart"" only reinforces the impact of the performance, as if he's trying to express something too large for the music.</p></div>"|6584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6584-aw-come-aw-wry/|7.6|Stephen M.

Containing five older and/or non-LP tracks in addition to </em><em>Celebration's ""Another Wound"", this EP finds the group foraging through some of their noisiest, most chancy material. But they've managed to do so with their acute melodic edges still fully honed, and consequently it seems doubtful that there's anything on this short, brash collection likely to either alienate the group's established fans or convert the sticklers.</em></p><p>
    With its fortified Bunnymen-meets-<em>Chronic Town jangle, ""Another Wound"" may initially seem an unlikely choice to headline such a punchy little set, but once this addictive lead-off has cruised through a couple effortless verses, its guitars have accumulated enough residual distortion to pack a not inconsiderable bite. Jered Gummere's distanced Richard Hell vocal hysterics remain a distinctly polarizing element throughout these tracks, as he settles his unique adenoidal yowl somewhere outside of both standardized punk affectations and conventional pop-weighted patterns.</em></p><p>
    His approach serves the Ponys well on their buzzed, surprisingly muscular cover of the Descendents' ""Good, Good Things"", an uninventive but nevertheless winning joiner that indicates the band can still pound out a waterproof garage anthem with effortless aplomb. One might expect more of the same from the quaint ""I Wanna Fuck You"", which instead proves to be exactly the type of artful guitar-pop that would've made another good neighbor on <em>Celebration Castle, with or without the chorus' casual swears. This cut does, however, contain a brief, torrential </em><em>Flip Your Wig guitar solo as markedly dissonant as any the Ponys have yet featured.</em></p><p>
    An alternate stripe of dissonance appears in the oddball clip-clop rhythms of ""Prosthetic Head"", a woozy shuffle filled with drippy underwater keyboard effects, trebly guitars and echo-laden vocals, with Gummere skating this uneven surface while fussily complaining about getting strangled with a telephone cord. The performance reveals in the band a welcome streak of eccentricity, one that provides for a sympathetic segue into the near-grunge of ""How Does It Taste"", a track which occasionally swerves within a chin-hair of Nirvana's ""All Apologies"".</p><p>
    Somewhat strangely, this short collection closes with a rather anti-climactic reprise of <em>Laced With Romance's ""Looking Out a Mirror"". A propulsive mélange of skronky guitars and beach party organ, the song contains what is still one of the Ponys' most impressive pop hooks, but its presence here does little to reassure listeners who're anxious to learn whether the group's most exciting work lies before them or behind them.</em></p></div>"|6540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6540-another-wound-ep/|7.3|Matthew Murphy

Experimental acts ranging from freeform tribes like Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice to electronic terrorists like Dead Machines or Hive Mind have managed to become almost ridiculously prolific, carpet-bombing the landscape with one EP, tour-only cassette, or home-burned CD-R after another.</p><p>
    
    And though typically released in modest quantities on a bevy of homemade micro-labels-- occasionally pressed in absurdly limited runs as small as 30 or 40 copies-- these rare crackled eggs always seem to eventually find their way to the internet, helping the groups to build brand-recognition via word-of-mouth if only through their sheer abundance of material. But while such steady, relentless output allows indiscriminate fans to live with a perpetual embarrassment of riches, it's also meant that too often quality control has been kicked to the curbside, as artists begin to place less importance on each individual recording, instead emphasizing their overall, ever-expanding body of work.</p><p>
    
    This tendency towards continuous production has now seemingly become so pervasive that, as evidenced by the Terrestrial Tones' <em>Oboroed / Circus Lives</em>, it has begun to govern side projects as well. Terrestrial Tones is a duo consisting of Dave ""Avey Tare"" Porter and Eric Copeland of, respectively, Animal Collective and Black Dice, two groups who've certainly never permitted cobwebs to settle on their discographies. <em>Oboroed / Circus Lives</em> follows the duo's debut album <em>Blasted</em> by a matter of months, and provides another, more potent dose of the twosome's burbling, minimalist electronic emissions.</p><p>
    
    Though titled and configured as if it's intended to be considered a single, the two-track <em>Oboroed / Circus Lives</em> contains well over 40 minutes of music and certainly requires the same listener commitment as a full album. Both pieces are loosely-assembled, home-recorded collages of processed samples, tape loops and inscrutable electronic ephemera, constructed with the same disheveled DIY charm as the abstractions on their debut. Here, however, the extended running time of each track has given the duo the necessary headroom for their unflappable, languid repetitions to truly hold sway.</p><p>
    
    Heard under the right circumstances, the shifting waves of the opening ""Oboroed"" can be as richly enveloping as a warm cloud of honey-scented smoke, its unhurried progressions calling to mind some of the more tranquil stretches of the Mille Plateaux back catalog. But the track's weave is so fragile that it threatens to disintegrate under close scrutiny, and when heard in the wrong mood its static, recurring loops of clipped laughter and processed chirping can quickly become as grating as intermittent wipers raking across a dry windshield.</p><p>
    
    Less finicky is the follow-up/flipside ""Circus Lives"". With its noisier, coarser features, this slightly shorter cut demands (and rewards) more rapt attention. The track opens with a series of agitated sci-fi effects, homely robot tones that later segue into what sounds like the malfunctioning calliope of a downtrodden circus. Towards song's end, the curtain is lifted suddenly to reveal Porter and Copeland in their street clothes, their hands clutching at puppet strings as the tune marches away on a pulse of cheap keyboards and distorted vocals.</p><p>
    
    As with <em>Blasted, one needs to strain a bit to hear much evidence of the musicians' other bands at work in Terrestrial Tones, though fans of Black Dice's </em><em>Creature Comforts</em> might occasionally catch a familiar scent on the wind. And as with their debut, one can't help but leave with the feeling that <em>Oboroed / Circus Lives could've withstood a vigorous revision or two, as well as with the realization that there's nothing to prevent these guys from releasing another couple records just like it before the year is out.</em></p></div>"|11854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11854-oboroedcircus-lives/|6.5|Matthew Murphy

It's a
    fucking epidemic. Since Devendra Banhart shepherded his golden apples
    onto one collection, indie rockers have had time to grow-out their
    hair/grizzled beards and practice some Vashti Bunyan/John Fahey tablature. So,
    unless you have a desire to purchase everything even vaguely arboreal
    or finger-picky, separating the raw and the cooked can be
    difficult.</p><p>
    
    A fresh breeze from Knoxville, Tennessee (for the time being, he
    says), James Toth aka Wooden Wand plays somber folk with smoky,
    chicken-coop ambiance. Sticking with the basics, his unadorned sound
    consists of guitar and voice: Singing into your ear, he whispers and caws over splintery
    strums. Now and again, his voice lifts
    like a hillbilly choir or a candlelit revival presided over by
    David Crosby. He mumbles. He exorcises and laments. He goes Bill Callahan on us.</p><p>
    
    Hardly a naive backwoodsman, ex-Golden Calves player Toth is the
    leader of upstart Brooklyn (and elsewhere) free-folk vagabonds, the
    Vanishing Voice. He also co-operates Polyamory Records with fellow
    ex-Calve and current-Dead Machines tone bender Tovah O'Rourke, wife of
    Wolf Eyes' John Olson. Regardless of Toth's experimental pedigree, <i>Harem of the
    Sundrum and the Witness Figg runs in a different direction than his
    all-over-the-map work with the Vanishing Voice (though you can
    hear hints of their thing in the opening flange-fest of loopy ""Warn
    Winch, Pts. 2-3""). That's the surprise and joy of this record:
    Not just adept at improvisation, Toth proves a strong, subtle
    songwriter.</i></p><p>
    
    The self-released cassette <em>Harem of the Sundrum</em> appeared last year,
    but this is a longer, fuller set. Toth sites inspiration as Grace Slick, Gene
    Clark, Fleetwood Mac, and John Phillips, but if you want it in laid
    out in zeitgeist terms, it's way less quirky than Banhart, could be
    compared to Wovenhand doing some California, blue-sky dreaming. It snaps and crackles: Once
    in a good while, he has a strange Tom Petty pronunciation and conjures
    Bastard Generals, but play it safe and drop lo-fidelity Roky
    Erickson.</p><p>
    
    The pieces establish a doleful sort of inspiration. ""Leave Your Perch..."" is a downer with soft, Grateful Dead guitar
    noodles bobbing over icy, shadowy strum and phaser humming like a
    firefly. ""Perch Modifier"" explicitly
    states some of the album's religious themes (God, angels, a bird
    singing ""weak, rejoice, the day is new"") and Toth's connection to
    landscape: ""Look up to the clouds/ Do you ever look past your boots
    and onto the ground?/ Do you ever think back to when you were very
    small?/ That's when you didn't need to rule over all."" The vocals
    double for the last line and the guitar pickings grow intricate,
    briefly, as if his heart's a-flutter.</p><p>
    
    A moderately upbeat spiritual, ""Vengeance, Pt. 2"" speaks of end times
    (Toth is sure he'll see all his friends and so he has ""nothing to
    fear"") and includes lovely barroom harmonizing for the curious, catchy
    line: ""Play your phonograph, it still makes baby laugh."" ""Sundrum Ladies"" feels like <em>Stranger Than
    Paradise</em> scored by M. Ward, focusing on the Louisiana sky, more babies,
    and some ragged, jittery (but hushed) soloing.</p><p>
    
    Reminiscent of Pink Mountaintops' truck-stop lite-rock blues, ""(Ask
    a) Sufist Chef"" imbibes in dancing skeletons, a blind magician (""he
    mistook a lizard for a rabbit and scared the children senseless""), and
    various ""miraculous things."" It ends with the refrain: ""We should be
    with God without attachment."" Toth acts move-to-the-country Smog circa
    Julius Caesar on ""Spiritual Inmate"" and rolls into wood-panelling falsetto on
    ""Eagle Claw"", where things grow ominous over the chilled Nashville
    skyline: ""Don't let your time pass you by.../ Don't save your last
    words 'til you die."" But, weirdly, the song actually sparkles.</p><p>
    
    These lo-fi hymns succeed because they're highly listenable. The collecton's direct, unadorned, honest,
    idiosyncratic. Like neo-folk's most interesting
    players (Banhart, Ben Chasny, Joanna Newsom), Toth sounds more like his
    precursors than his contemporaries, and very much like himself.
    Timeless is a tough (even questionable) word to plunk down
    on the present, but all things considered (and considered carefully),
    <em>Harem of the Sundrum and the Witness Figg</em> should sound especially singular this
    time next year, even if Toth goes and
    gets himself a buzz cut.</p></div>"|8798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8798-harem-of-the-sundrum-and-the-witness-figg/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

    been a
    treat hearing his weathered, weezy rasp on mixtapes (most notably DJ
    Drama's
    <i>Trap or Die</i>). He is a conduit between the South, where most of today's
    commercially lucrative hip-hop originates, and a lagging East Coast
    scene.
    <em>Let's Get It is not the best rap album of the year and Jeezy is hardly
    the
    world's greatest lyricist. But he slings a sometimes-creepy,
    sometimes-clever, sometimes-chaotic charisma and he rides that
    magnetism to
    a mostly brilliant solo entrance to the bigs.</em></p><p>
    
    On opener ""Thug Motivation 101"" Jeezy pounds his chest and growls, ""I
    used
    to hit the kitchen lights, cockroaches er'where/ Now I hit the kitchen
    lights, there's marble floors er'where"" over tense, eerie keyboards.
    It's a
    joyous moment but also the scariest album opener I've heard this year.
    He
    breathes hard on the track and stares down his microphone like it hates
    him.
    He punctuates the song with his calling card. By now Da Snowman's
    ad-libs
    are things of legend. Unbridled ""Daaaayuums"" and everlasting
    ""Yeeeeaaahs"" or
    ""Thaaaaat's riiiiight""s punctuate each song. For most MCs this would
    weigh
    down their words. For Jeezy, it's the essence of his persona: maniacal
    shouting, catchphrases, euphoria, instant gratification. There's no
    parsing
    through flow and lyrics and drum machines. He hits hard and quickly.</p><p>
    
    ""My Hood"", while cheap, easy, and out of character for the steadily
    mean-mugged Jeezy, is blissful, thanks to a chintzy Casio beat and some
    sort
    of My Hood=Our Hood claptrap. ""Get Ya Mind Right"" runs on horror movie
    organ
    fuel, like a Goblin-Argento soundtrack redux. ""And Then What"" finds
    Mannie
    Fresh in fine, fat-faced form while Jeezy heads down to his ""Auntie
    House""
    before he goes boom, boom clap. ""Go Crazy"" is the height of the
    Mason-Dixon
    bridge. It is also the best 1998 Roc-A-Fella drug rap song in some
    time,
    featuring producer Don Cannon's spare tom rolls, classy horns and a
    killer
    chorus. A recent remix featuring New York kings Jay-Z and Fat Joe was
    one of
    the more obvious (and thrilling) things to happen to hip-hop in recent
    months and confims Jeezy's universality.</p><p>
    
    All the fun shit aside, at 19 tracks and no skits, <em>Let's Get It is long
    and
    can become a chore to wade through. Barring the Bun B-assisted classic
    ""Trap
    or Die"" and the soul-jockeying ""Talk to Em"" the album's second half
    really
    lags and Jeezy's allure ultimately wears. Why more artists don't follow
    the
    Illmatic code remains a mystery. We buy mixtapes for a reason, dudes.</em></p></div>"|8916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8916-lets-get-it-thug-motivation-101/|7.7|Sean Fennessey

The group formed in Tampa, where the core duo of Dan Matz and Jason McNeely were joined by drummer Greg Anderson. Since that time, the band grew to a four-piece, then shrank again to just Matz and McNeely, and those two have moved all over the country, with McNeely residing in Austin, Texas, and Matz calling various East Coast cities home. In summer 2004, however, the two both moved to Philadelphia. As a result, <em>Giving up the Ghost</em> is an anomaly in the band's catalogue. Instead of being forced to get together semi-annually to share ideas and record, WFTD were able to record in their home studio, creating an album that is more fluid than past efforts, yet retains the band's characteristic disconnected feel.</p><p>
    
    Windsor for the Derby's music has always been a bit of a mish-mash. Long instrumentals borrowed from post-rock sidle up next to folk-tinged pop songs; jarring, discordant guitar lines ramble over subdued electronics. And although <em>Ghost</em> doesn't really break from that mold, it finds the band moving further into the quiet, low-key ambience they've been flirting with on the last couple of discs. Most of the songs feature solemn, at times almost whispered, vocals, with several songs employing haunting, catchy hooks.</p><p>
    
    ""Empathy for People Unknown"" uses layered vocals and droning keyboards to create the hollow atmosphere that permeates the disc. Elsewhere, the band flirts with new wave on ""Praise"" and post-punk on ""Gathering""; both fine examples of their knack for taking on a variety of styles while still sounding distinctive. In fact, that dichotomy, that ability to at once sound fresh and conventional, has always been on of WFTD's greatest assets. Perhaps it's a result of Matz and McNeely building their musical relationship from different parts of the country. </p><p>
    
    The strongest number here is ""Giving Up"", a dark, wistful ballad that begins with strained vocals and acoustic guitar that slowly lead into a somber, repetitive middle section, building to the refrain, ""It's probable/ Things fall apart."" It's the sort of tune that could change Natalie Portman's life in <em>Garden State II</em>.</p><p>
    
    There are only two instrumentals: Opener ""Dirge for a Pack of Lies"" and ""The Front"". The former features an odd, minimalist beat accented by what sounds like an accordion, while the latter is the closest thing here to post-rock, with swirling echoes of keys, guitar harmonics, and other muffled ambient noise surrounding plaintive acoustic guitar strumming. </p><p>
    
    With the addition of Anna Neighbor and Charlie Hall to the line-up, Windsor for the Derby has once again branched into full-band status. The fact that this line-up has been frequently performing live only strengthens the cohesiveness of <em>Giving up the Ghost</em>, which may stand as the band's most focused disc to date.</p></div>"|8784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8784-giving-up-the-ghost/|6.8|Cory D.

These weightier releases typically feature nakedly emotional titles: <em>P.S. I Love You</em>, <i>The Soccergirl EP</i>, ""Sometimes"", ""If My Heart Ever Ran Away It Would Be Looking For The Day When Right Beside You It Could Forever Stay"". I've always found these records charming, as they convincingly render the dull romantic ache of a young artist who spends way too much time alone in front of his computer. Because of who Kid606 is and what we know of his obsessions, there's a hint that perhaps technology has become an impediment to love.</p><p>
<em>Resilience</em> is the latest in this line, and here Kid606 <em>really</em> puts himself in an artistically vulnerable place, dedicating the record to his mom, putting a photo of a young child on the cover (looks like Depedro at age three), and proclaiming that he ""didn't want to die without releasing <em>Resilience</em>."" More than most of his peers, Kid606 understands that weird music without fixed emotional signposts can be shaped by titles and presentation. The unabashedly personal nature of <em>Resilience is supposed to make the music heavier and more resonant, I guess, but something feels off. Ultimately the directness with which Depedro addresses his audience is positive, adding a goofy humanity to his machine music, but the undercurrent of manipulation around </em><em>Resilience</em> is initially repellent.</p><p>
    
    Which would of course be easily forgivable as long as the music is good. <em>Resilience</em> is quite different from earlier Kid606 forays into ambient, mostly in that it's not really ambient at all. It is instead a stab at an electronic pop album, with chords, melodies and band-like arrangements. From there Kid606 feels from to wander, from dark new wave in the tradition of Gary Numan (""Done With the Scene"" and ""Sugercoated"") to bubbly reggae (""Phoenix Riddim"" and ""Hold it Together""). The textures are not novel and are not supposed to be, so a record like this is going to live or die on the basis of its tunes.</p><p>
    
    A few make it for sure. ""I Miss You"" has a synth patch that sounds like Joe Zawinul's electric piano from Cannonball Adderly's ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy"" and Kid606 goes to church with it, piecing together a simply melody oozing with uplift. ""Banana Peel"" is robotic dub with a real sense of swing that slowly builds its infectious hook over its length, so that when it finally comes together at the end the tension is released toward the sky. And ""King of Harm"" is a slight step down but still enjoyable, convincing pastoral nostalgia dented in an interesting way by metallic percussion.</p><p>
    
    If everything here were on par with these three tracks, Kid606 would have something, but the bulk of <em>Resilience</em> consists of indistinct mid-tempo beats and a lot vague loops that don't go anywhere. During certain stretches the music has an oddly narcotic effect, tapping into that distracted alpha state that comes from listening to too many middling records from Morr. That these inoffensively dull tracks are collected as a Big Statement, something the artist has longed to get off his chest, is a little depressing-- and not in a good way.</p></div>"|4411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4411-resilience/|6.0|Mark Richardson

Granted, it seems impossible to get past the legend, for him or for listeners. He appears to have been more intelligent-- or at least better spoken-- than your average first-generation punk, and his vocals sounded fierce in their commitment to the material. His lefty politics had a bristling integrity, yet weren't so extreme as to be inaccessible or unrealistic. All in all, he showed many younger musicians that it was possible to play punk that was more than nihilist or fascist. To many, he represents rock's most populist principles, grandest ambitions, and highest callings. A handful of good-not-great albums and one or two side projects were all the solo work he left when he died suddenly in 2002, and none of it compares to his work with the Clash.

    His influences were wide-ranging, although nowadays they're rarely as regarded as those he influenced. He found inspiration in early rock n' roll, particularly the Sun Studio sound (it's no coincidence Jim Jarmusch cast him in the Memphis-set <i>Mystery Train, arguably his finest post-Clash work). And yet, his later solo albums like </i><i>Global A-Go-Go</i>, <em>Rock Art and the X-Ray Style</em>, and parts of <em>Streetcore</em> drew from world music influences. As in his politics, his music readily acknowledged a world and a culture apart from Western imperialists. Astralwerks is resurrecting two projects that showcase the diversity of his musical interests: a collection of songs from his band the 101'ers and a mid-1980s soundtrack he composed.</p><p>
    
    The 101'ers were a London pub-rock band that formed in the early 1970s and played around London exhaustively. They cut several demos, prepared a single, and toured with the Sex Pistols before Strummer joined what would become the Clash. <em>Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited</em>-- a mouthful of a title-- collects all their recorded output onto one disc, providing a brief but thorough overview of the band's short career. It encompasses the LP <i>Elgin Avenue Breakdown</i>, which was released in 1981, and a few live tracks and an alternate take of their lone single, ""Keys to Your Heart"" (reportedly inspired by future Slits drummer Palmolive). In addition to contemporary groups like Dr. Feelgood, the obvious pub-rock connection is early r&amp;b;, derived from early progenitors like Chuck Berry and Ike Turner through the early Beatles-- at times it sounds like Elgin Avenue could be located in Hamburg. They even cover ""Maybelline"".</p><p>
    
    While pub-rock has modest aims, <em>Revisited proves generally solid, anchored by songs like ""letsagetabitarockin'"" and ""Steamgauge 99"", rambunctious run-throughs that rush headlong into their melodies, as Strummer delivers his lyrics in a garbled slur. But there really are no surprises here, just a general consistency on the studio tracks that bleeds into repetitiveness, hinting that Strummer turned to punk perhaps out of restlessness with pub-rock's strictures. The live cuts of ""Maybelline"" and ""Gloria"" suggest he was already halfway there by the time he met his future bandmates.</em></p><p>
    
    Skip ahead almost a decade: After the Clash had a top 10 U.S. hit with ""Rock the Casbah"", the group disbanded, and an aimless Strummer acted in and soundtracked the Nicaraguan epic <em>Walker</em>, starring Ed Harris and directed by Alex Cox. Cox was and still is notorious for <em>Repo Man and </em><em>Sid &amp; Nancy, and he and Strummer worked together on </em><em>Straight to Hell around the same time. </em><em>Walker</em> was an ambitious flop, but Strummer's soundtrack holds up fairly well, thanks mainly to a group of seasoned musicians. His mix of Latin American music with a determined pop flair creates some intriguing moments, like the rollicking rhythms and Zander Schloss's quick picking on ""Machete"" and the two versions of the samba ""Filibustero"" (the original and a remix that originally appeared on a rare 12""), which bookend the soundtrack nicely. The vocal tracks sound like barroom sing-alongs, rowdy and slurred, but tuneful and more atmospheric than many of the instrumental tracks.</p><p>
    
    But <em>Walker</em> is as much a product of its time and circumstances as of Strummer's imagination. With its slick saxophone, ""Latin Romance"" sounds like a lost '80s relic, a slice of cinematic cheese. Strummer seems as confined here as he did with the 101'ers, which may be due to the restrictions either of the film itself or of the soundtrack form. Like <em>Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited</em>, <em>Walker</em> at the very least expands our picture of Strummer as it presents an artist whose imagination was often bigger than the forms he worked in-- a predicament that created a compelling tension between possibility and actuality, the music as it is and the music as it could have been.</p></div>"|11834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11834-elgin-avenue-breakdown-revisitedwalker-ost/|7.0|Stephen M.

Granted, it seems impossible to get past the legend, for him or for listeners. He appears to have been more intelligent-- or at least better spoken-- than your average first-generation punk, and his vocals sounded fierce in their commitment to the material. His lefty politics had a bristling integrity, yet weren't so extreme as to be inaccessible or unrealistic. All in all, he showed many younger musicians that it was possible to play punk that was more than nihilist or fascist.

Consequently, the box set section of most American record stores currently boasts a big, black mess of Johnny Cash-themed cubes. Posthumous marketing is particularly vicious: <em>The Original Sun Albums, </em><em>Unearthed, </em><em>Man in Black, and now the four-disc </em><em>The Legend</em> bang corners, demanding further canonization, tapping persistently at our shoulders and wallets.</p><p>
    
    Still, the diversity of the Cash shopping spectrum is oddly apt: Both in-store and out, there are loads of different Cash archetypes to choose from. Check Outlaw Cash, with his middle finger shooting heavenward, face scrunched into anti-authoritarian glee, invading prison yards and calmly bellowing, ""I shot a man in Reno/ Just to watch him die."" Conjure Country Cash, standing alongside Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, eyes hard, shaking his head at Nashville's pop-evolution. Note Family Cash, devoutly religious, wanting to record gospel songs with Sam Phillips, curling into June, and praying to be faithful. Or watch Neo-Cash lock arms with Rick Rubin, inadvertently charming the PBR-and-Pumas set with loads of quasi-ironic covers.</p><p>
    
    It's only logical, then, that <i>The Legend</i> is all-Cash in all forms. It's the most comprehensive Cash box released to date, covering nearly a half-century (1955-2002) of song, parsing his discography into four logically-titled discs: ""Win, Place and Show: The Hits"", which gathers radio favorites, ""Old Favorites and New"", all classic Cash, ""The Great American Songbook"", which sees Cash tackling traditional cuts, and ""Family and Friends"", two dozen collaborative cuts. <i>The Legend</i> is being released by Columbia, and unsurprisingly, focuses more heavily on Cash's Columbia work than his early Sun recordings. Regardless, its four discs expertly showcase the astonishing scope of Cash's talent: ranging from goofy, 1950s teen dance-pop (""Ballad of a Teenage Queen"", ""Guess Things Happen That Way"") to gospel (""Were You There (When They Crucified My Lord)"", with the Carter Family) to traditional Americana standards (""I've Been Working on the Railroad"", ""Streets of Laredo""). The breadth of Cash's songbook almost justifies the dozens of roles he's been hustled into over the last 50 years-- and with seven previously unreleased songs, dug up from tapes in a backroom at the House of Cash, devotees are sure to start rethinking all other boxes crowding their shelves.</p><p>
    
    Cash recorded his first single for Sun in 1955 (""Hey, Porter"" / ""Cry, Cry, Cry""), featuring Marshall Grant on bass and Luther Perkins on guitar (then known as the Tennessee Two, and later, after W.S. Holland, one of country music's very first drummers, joined the lineup, as the Tennessee Three). But it wasn't until 1956, with the release of ""I Walk the Line"", a dutiful promise of loyalty to then-wife Vivian Liberto, that Cash managed to snag a hit. Appropriately, ""I Walk the Line"" opens the first disc of <em>The Legend, its meandering guitar line interrupted by Cash's tinny humming, pitter-patter percussion, and that voice: Soul and gravity were hard-wired into Johnny Cash's pipes. Rumbling and shockingly understated, Cash's deep, belly-blows sound like divine direction, all confidence and purity. The effects are transformative: Imagine ""Ring of Fire"" sung karaoke-style, and then reconsider how Cash's grim nonchalance pushes the song to new levels of weird profundity, a sober counterpart to its yapping horns and jiggly rhythms. </em></p><p>
    
    Disc One corrals all of Cash's proper hits, making for a monstrous party record; Disc Two offers up a less cohesive collection (herded in under the vague heading ""Old Favorites and New""), but manages some impressive transitions. Cash's rendition of ""Long Black Veil"" (also attempted by Joan Baez, David Allen Coe, Marianne Faithful, the Band, and Bobby Bare) is properly captivating: when Cash gets to the ""me"" in ""The slayer who ran/ Looked a lot like me,"" his voice presses delicately but firmly, guaranteeing loads of jittery chills. Disc Two also harbors three previously unissued tracks, the best of which falls first: ""Doin' My Time"" is a pert, swinging ode to proper imprisonment, complete with guitar solo and courthouse laments. </p><p>
    
    Disc Three is packed with American classics, including a handful of Leadbelly songs (collected by Alan Lomax, of course), some Jimmie Rodgers, and plenty of Traditional cuts. Disc Four, which includes a mess of duets (see Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Ray Charles, and others), has its questionable moments (Cash fronting U2 for ""The Wanderer"" is particularly gruesome), but closes with <em>The Legend's prized jewel: ""It Takes One to Know Me"", written by Carlene Carter, June Carter Cash's daughter from her marriage to country star Carl Smith. Johnny attempted to record the song in 1977, as a duet with June, but left the song unfinished; Carlene's brother, John Carter Cash, agreed to produce the track, adding backing vocals by himself, his wife Laura, and his sister Carlene. ""It Takes One to Know Me"" mixes pristine, swelling strings with schmaltzy piano and guitar, but the vocals are mind-blowingly gritty: June and Johnny croon in perfect imperfect harmony, vowing earnest devotion to each other, acknowledging all the knots inherent to matrimony. The results are hauntingly real. </em></p><p>
    
    People tend to discuss Johnny Cash with grave, unbridled reverence, which is appropriate but awkward: His website (which bursts open with a booming ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash, welcome to JohnnyCash.com!"", a proclamation just loud and weird enough to knock you off your chair), compares ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"" to ""In God We Trust"", claiming both ""resonate throughout the world"" and ""stand the test of time."" The liner notes to <em>The Legend</em> boast that in 1969, Muhammad Ali and Johnny Cash were the best-known people on the planet. Cash's prominence may have wilted slightly in the past 35 years, but not significantly, and <em>The Legend. should only confirm Cash's American Hero cred-- not as some presupposed ""authentic,"" but as an astoundingly multi-talented songwriter.</em></p></div>"|1333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1333-the-legend/|9.0|Amanda Petrusich

The next 31 minutes are a headlong blur of scratchy guitar, Celtic and country influences, pounding rhythm, and Scottish accents, a brand of danceable Glasgow post-punk that actually makes a sonic point of its Scottishness. The adversarial vocal interplay of Scott Paterson and Adele Bethel provides a dramatic focal point for the band's thumping arrangements. In my review of their debut EP, last year's <em>Love the Cup</em>, I compared them to Prolapse with their shoegaze tendencies replaced by Highland folk and slide guitar, and the comparison still holds here.</p><p>
    
    As it turns out, the album's brief running time is something of a saving grace, as the band's relentless approach-- even the quiet songs ride fast, insistent beats-- is a bit numbing over the course of a whole LP. The music is intensely simple, almost minimalist, and Ailidh Lennon's bass (she switches to mandolin on opener ""Medicine"") locks in with drummer David Yow to create the irresistible undertow that churns Paterson's guitar into knotty tangles.</p><p>
    
    Even with the band's relatively monochromatic range, there are a few standout tracks. The jumpy scuzzbucket march ""Dance Me In"", Bethel taking lead against a chorus of ""whoa-oh""ing Patersons as fierce snare drum crookedly crackles below. ""Taste the Last Girl"" rides a shuffle beat and features the album's biggest chorus, one of the few that doesn't explode from a more subdued verse. Paterson's slide guitar gets its best workout on ""Choked"", erupting in manic, violent outbursts.</p><p>
    
    The record's arid, unadorned sound-- as captured with almost live rawness by Nick Cave and PJ Harvey producer Victor Van Vugt-- does have its occasional drawbacks, one being that in some of her more outlandish moments of rage, Bethel's vocals stand out a little too strongly, such as her shrill screams on the chorus of ""Gone"" and some of her more emphatic shouts on ""Red Receiver"". But the rough-around-the-edges sound generally works in the band's favor, the record's feeling of spontaneity often proving one of its biggest assets. Sons &amp; Daughters are far from perfect, but <em>The Repulsion Box</em> is an energetic, sometimes thrilling record by a band slowly but surely carving out a unique niche for themselves.</p></div>"|7774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7774-the-repulsion-box/|7.5|Joe Tangari

    challenge to the decency of all decent people. They're a flaming pile
    of rubber dog shit fulminating on the front porch, and our instinct is
    to put it out, turn it off, shout ""get off the fucking stage!"" as
    exasperated Mudhoney fans supposedly demanded during a
    characteristically Icky opening set. But then, with the crowd thinned
    out and gag reflexes successfully repressed, the early-90s San
    Francisco noisefuck trio's perverse, incongruously vulnerable charm
    reveals itself like the too-familiar special sauce in your fish taco.</p><p>
    Overdue 61-track retrospective <em>A Love Obscene</em> compiles the
    Ickies' two albums plus assorted shits/giggles, all otherwise out of
    print. With amateurishness to spare, Afro'd frontman Jon Swift
    supervises start-stop, off-key ruminations on spermicidal jelly
    (""nothing kills passion quicker than a mouthful""), environmental
    paranoia (""there's fuck-all you can really do""), and New Kids on the
    Block (with Donnie impressions!). Swift is equally unstinting in his
    praise, typically reserved for Mission burritos, dental dams, and a
    woman named Kate (""it must be 'cause your name isn't Katharine, Kathy,
    Kathleen... Catwoman... Keith Richards...""). Guitarist Shea Bond
    flails at nursery-rhyme riffs beneath hideous vacuum-cleaner
    distortion, while drummer Anthony Bedard sloppily rehearses ""Wipe
    Out"". Tape hiss guests.</p><p>
    What separates Icky Boyfriends from joke-punks like Circle Jerks or
    Dwarves-- aside from admittedly ""no-fidelity"" recording-- is a
    scared-stupid sincerity akin to Modern Lovers.
    ""Nervous Guy"" is the guard-down naïf-rock Rosetta Stone placing the
    other songs in proper context. ""Maybe we'll be somewhere eating
    spaghetti/ And you won't even mind if I spill some of your tea"",
    Swift muses, practically blushing. The awkward tenderness of ""Nervous
    Guy"" and ""Our Love Song"" helps the Ickies get away with blasphemies:
    the title of the collection, say, or a typically tuneless, yet
    affecting, take on John Lennon's ""Love"". Admiring giggles further
    absolve them of ripping off the Kinks' ""She's Got Everything"" in an
    ode to masochism (""Toenails"") and the MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams"" for
    abortion-clinic jokes (""Closet"").</p><p>
    Inevitably, <em>A Love Obscene</em> contains an imperfection or two (the
    Icky metal of ""Sycamore St."", the ""Hotel California"" bonus track).
    Yes, the Ickies' world is self-indulgent and masturbatory. Nevertheless, their sound is a fitting precursor to the
    hilarious yet obvious shoutings of Art Brut and the schizophrenic
    hyper-noise of labelmates like Deerhoof and Bunnybrains. Adopting a
    line from the band's hilarious art-rock lampoon ""Frank: A Rock Opera"",
    Bedard gave his post-Ickies film the title <em>I'm Not Fascinating</em>.
    Any otherwise-decent person who has ever slowed down near a car crash
    might beg to differ.</p></div>"|4165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4165-a-love-obscene/|7.5|Marc Hogan

    confirms the arrival of a rap innovator in the tradition of Kool
    Keith, MF Doom, Doseone, and Missy Elliott; naturally, attempts to
    pigeonhole him end in futility. After crewing L.A.'s underground rap
    scene with Project Blowed and others, he's breaking out on the
    predominantly no-wave indie Gold Standard Labs, big-upping Pink &amp;
    Brown and the Mars Volta. Sub's an emo-rapper at heart (pun intended-- check the Oberstian chorus on the title track: ""Young dangerous heart/ Just to let you know I'm not done with you/ Even though you may
    have a hole in you""), but he embodies his vulnerable human sentiments
    in a sputtering glitch-hop that epitomizes cold technological
    precision. These contradictions congeal into a music that's
    unmistakably Subtitle's own, so when he brags about his
    innovator-status, the bluster is earned.</p><p>
    With dense cyber-babble, Subtitle builds his lexicon from the
    ground up, and while a few weak MCs get served and a couple sketchy
    corners held down, gun-talk, crime-thought, and materialistic tropes
    are largely absent. Instead, we get human holograms, quarter inch
    jacks, hydrofoil travel, pixilated portraits, Gigapets, software
    upgrades, .jpeg files, schematics, optic cables, firewalls,
    motherboards, and C++. When Sub talks about being ""out to rip charts
    apart"" on ""Con-Contrived (I'm Not)"", we assume he means wiring
    diagrams, not Billboard. Threats of violence appear as musical, not
    physical warnings (""Give me an 8-bit machine, I'll take out your whole
    crew""), and Sub seems more worried about getting nerve-gassed on the
    train (getting paranoid over the squelchy bass of ""Subtalk"") than
    getting carjacked on the Ave.</p><p>
    But like most MCs of note, what Subtitle says is less important than
    how he says it, and here, he's the MC-as-hypnotist, his voice as
    mesmeric as a spinning pocket watch. He splits the difference between
    Del's monotonous lilt (<em>Deltron 3030</em> is this album's closest
    antecedent) and Gift of Gab's tripping, alliterative flow, and if this
    rap shit doesn't pan out, he could always fall back on recording vocal
    samples for Speak &amp; Spell. Driving home his ghost-in-the-machine
    aesthetic, Subtitle spends more time breast-stroking through his beats
    than rapping over them, and liberally applies that strobe effect that
    makes his voice sound like a Dntel production. </p><p>
    Fleshing out a handful of self-produced tracks, Alias drops a
    typically ethereal beat on ""Gio-graph-ick""; Lab Waste partner Adlib
    sears, slithers and glides on the title track and ""Cray Crazy"" (a
    standout featuring perfectly assimilated cameos from Busdriver, No Can
    Do, and Aceyalone); Octavius catches spooky wreck on ""Killer Drones on
    Street"". Sonic density is paramount-- it's not Dälek dense; you can
    make out the components, more like King Geedorah ""No Snakes Alive""
    dense, and often just as unhinged. The album falters over its own
    bloat (17 tracks) when it forgets about thickness, notably on the
    going-nowhere bass skeletons of the Subtitle-produced ""Palm Fronds""
    and ""Where To?"", but Sub shows promise as a beat auteur on the
    faltering electro dirge ""Springtime in Rufferdam"" and the nearly
    grime-caliber sinew of ""Serial Boxes"". If rap's future is tending
    toward simplicity, this is the Jetsons version, all flying bubble cars
    and robot maids. </p></div>"|7826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7826-young-dangerous-heart/|7.3|Brian Howe

    His home, let's-fuck-around-with-a-sampler project has
    grown into an internationally buzzed-about album,
    <em>Thunder, Lightning, Strike; his band has signed to
    Columbia for American distribution; and his show at
    the Intonation Festival brought Pitchfork staffers to
    tears like the ending of <i>Field of Dreams</i></em>. Yes, Ian
    Parton is surely living the good life, hitting his
    stride, and all sorts of other positive clichés. OR
    IS HE?</p><p>
    You see, certain demands come with a higher profile,
    and Parton now finds himself besieged by
    problems that surely never intruded upon his
    home-recorded masterpiece. Thanks to <i>TLS's reliance upon samples, the
    Go! Team is now confronted with the terrifying visage
    of the American legal system, which recently brought
    the Beastie Boys all the way to the doorstep of the
    Supreme Court over three notes of flute music. There's also the challenge of having a band
    on the payroll-- a feature that has the potential to
    expand the group's sound, but also carries the risk of
    hamstringing Parton's creativity.</i></p><p>
    The full ramifications of these new challenges won't
    be known until the remixed <em>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</em>
    and the band's second album arrive, but this tour EP--
    sold on the Go! Team's recent jaunt Down Under-- offers
    a few early clues. For starters, there's the new
    ""single version"" of ""Bottle Rocket"", which is
    presumably washed clean of any musical snippets
    that might unleash the law's fury. While the
    differences are minor-- the most prominent is
    an exchange of the original's sampled rap for a vocal
    by frontwoman Ninja-- it's still disorienting to those
    off us who have lived with <em>TLS</em> for a year, sort of
    like seeing your girlfriend with a new haircut.</p><p>
    The tracks that resemble <i>TLS' overstuffed hybrids are previously released B-sides. ""The Ice
    Storm"" bases its jittery, drum-less energy around what
    sounds like </i><i>The Exorcist's tubular-bells score and a
    mournful organ, while ""We Listen Everyday"" is further
    proof that the Go! Team's most obvious touchstone,
    intentional or no, is the Avalanches, thanks to its deft
    blend of dusty, out-of-time artifacts all filtered
    through a fuzzy-stylus turntable. More reassuring is new track ""We Just Won't Be Defeated"", which reunites
    the shrill cheerleader samples with Charlie Brown
    piano and horn blasts. Like a three-minute sampler of
    Parton's favorite sounds, it's proof that the band's </i><i>TLS</i> sound isn't tapped out. </p><p>
    The two remaining songs, previously unreleased ""Did You Feel It Too?"" and ""The Power Is On"" B-side ""Hold Yr Terror Close"", are the most significant
    deviations from the Go! Team's album, both
    showcasing drummer Chi Fukami's twee vocals. The tracks are little more than piano and
    vocals but they also tap the nostalgia button, exchanging the cop-show and Morricone
    score influences for the simple ditties that
    used to back ""Sesame Street"" montages of playground
    safety or crayon factories. They got ""Sesame Street"" in
    England, right?</p><p>
    So this tour-only EP, whether it becomes a widely
    available item or not, maintains the Go! Team's
    momentum. Like most EPs, it's merely a
    snack to keep fans satiated between albums, but at
    least it gives us something to add to our file library
    while we speculate whether the band can navigate its next challenge: avoiding the sophomore
    slump.</p></div>"|3655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3655-are-you-ready-for-more-ep/|7.9|Rob Mitchum

After his group Little Brother's decent debut, <em>The Listening</em>, 9th pre-empted Dangermouse's ballyhooed <em>Grey Album by rethinking Nas' <i>God's Son</i> as </em><em>Illmatic</em>'s reprise, an achievement which bought him studio time with Nas nemesis Jay-Z on <em>The Black Album</em>. Convolution is a wonderful thing-- his Hovi track, not so much. Following his work with rap's fave retiree, 9th spun an album of breezy takes on Left Coast G-funk on Murs' <em>3:16. Now, he's teamed with the oft-forgotten Buckshot of Black Moon/Boot Camp Clik for an album that breathes life, yet again, into the mid-90s NYC sound. Here, as opposed to some 22-year-olds nostalgia jacking, it's fitting, as </em><em>Chemistry blends 9th's backward-glancing production and Buck's timeless street talk to results that find both pushing the outer limits of their natural abilities.</em></p><p>
<em>Chemistry's biggest surprise is Buckshot's energy. It's been a rough road for the BDI MC, and he's starving here, taking large bites out of the new guard. For instance, ""Everybody got a label or a mixtape/ Saying you gettin' money/ But next week, it's back to your shift and break/ 'Til your back shift and break."" Spoken like a man who's been touted as the Next Man but realized he isn't.</em></p><p>
    
    Buckshot still stretches his syllables like a rubber band, letting the ends of lines snap with the beat. The sing-toast style that is the calling card of Boot Camp's finest merges nicely with 9th Wonder's rolling bass, swooning string samples, and stop/start drum programming. Buckshot's decision to partner with 9th says as much about his self-awareness as his business acumen, linking up with the one producer in his price range that can recreate the Beatminerz/Large Professor/Premier aura of Buck's heyday. Working with new blood with old ideas has Buck feeling his fighting legs again; Buckshot's soft talk/big stick approach always has and always will sound best in front of a string section and pulled taffy basslines. Put him up with some synthed-out thugtronics and his allure would be lost amongst the clamor. Apparently written on the fly after hearing 9th's tracks for Boot Camp alum Sean Price's album, Buck's rhymes are a reminder of the verbal wizardry that had him mentioned alongside Nas, Big, and the Wu fellows once upon a time. His voice has always been a simmering fire, a gravelly, almost whispering menace certainly inspired by some Rakim mirror mugging.</p><p>
    
    Albums like <em>Chemistry</em> are written off by a lot of people who don't get down with its retro leanings-- and it certainly doesn't help that 9th Wonder is only a serviceable replacement for those with whom he's compared. His sample selection is tasteful, but someone needs to buy my man some drums. It's a simple question of technique. His predecessors-- Pete Rock, Primo, Large Professor via Paul C (Google ""Dave Tompkins Paul C""), and even Boot Camp's own Da Beatminerz-- all chopped sampled drums, and the results were full, thick slabs of marbled beats. 9th programs his own, and they are hollow and processed. But, that's how it goes when a snare can be traced and tapped for royalty payments.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, Buckshot doesn't seem to care he's rhyming over a facsimile of the salad days. He's thrilled to be back in the game, even if it's one he can't necessarily win. </p></div>"|1172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1172-chemistry/|7.8|Peter Macia

    Life and Times, has seen more than his fair share of personnel changes
    under his watch. Shiner's drummer was replaced before it
    recorded an album, and it set the tone for several more switches centering around
    singer/guitarist Epley and bassist Paul Malinowski of Season to Risk.
    When Season to Risk broke up, Shiner absorbed two more of its members to
    record <em>The Egg</em>, the band's fourth and best effort. The album struck
    an engaging balance between melody and slight
    experimentation, but soon after its release the band
    unceremoniously dissolved. The Life and Times has already changed some members
    between its debut EP and this, its first LP, but by working fast and
    sweeping up two local musicians (Eric Albert from Ring, Cicada on bass and
    Chris Metcalf of Stella Link on drums), Allen Epley has finally found a
    band that fits.</p><p>
    
    On <em>Suburban Hymns</em>, shoegaze-inspired guitars are neatly
    folded between heavy modern rock drumming, rhythms are toyed with,
    stretched, and collapsed on songs like ""Muscle Cars"" and ""Skateland"", and the
    band creates a wall of sound that moves in and evaporates like fog,
    leaving only keyboards and moogs behind. It's a new step for
    Epley that, for once, places mood and atmosphere ahead of the riffs.</p><p>
    
    The tradeoff is that mood takes
    precedence over hooks. There are catchy moments-- the winding
    melodies from the propulsive ""Coat of Arms"" and ""Running Red Lights"" and closing ballad ""A Chorus of Crickets""-- but most songs, like ""Muscle Cars"" or the ironically-titled ""Thrill Ride"", are
    well-executed mood pieces. ""Skateland"" escapes the mire with a strong (if
    grunge-like) vocal performance and some subtle piano during the bridge,
    but subtle touches can become lost amongst the band's
    bluster. Ghostly falsetto floats throughout opener ""My Last Hostage"" and
    drifts above the propulsive ""Coat of Arms"" that follows, and the
    overpowering keyboards of ""Mea Culpa"" fade into the lonely moogs that open ""A
    Chorus of Crickets"", where we hear Epley's untreated voice for the first
    time. Despite the pessimistic title, it cant help but
    sound inspiring, a light ballad with just enough restraint.</p><p>
    
    Lyrics about drinking the ocean or ""ice cubes in the sea"" sound clumsy
    at first, but when taken together and included with song titles like ""A
    Chorus of Crickets"" and lines like ""running with the bulls to the
    latest hit parade,"" an attitude emerges. Producer J. Robbins, who usually
    records emo and punk bands with sharp, clean production, consistently
    distorts Epley's voice while making the rest of the band sound like a
    sharpened jangle-spitting machine. It compliments Epley's voice well, but
    there's a thematic precedence for Robbins' choices.</p><p>
    
    Epley's moaning sounds heavy with resignation, and his voice floats
    above the band rather than with it. The guitars that play just behind the
    slow, galloping drums of ""Skateland"" sound like the three men of The
    Life and Times overwhelmed by the apathy of the world, playing fiercely to themselves with their back turned to the audience. The chemistry between the band's members is easy to hear, but it
    seems like a heavy shrug of the shoulders compared to the boundaries
    pushed during the last days of Shiner. Hopefully, Epley can keep The Life
    and Times together for a few more recordings, because it sounds like he
    has the right group of musicians to push his vision forward, if he
    wants to.</p></div>"|4987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4987-suburban-hymns/|7.4|Jason Crock

That's because their percussionist is a fucking inanimate object from Japan called a drum machine.</p><p>
    
    At least my friend was correct about one thing: Agoraphobic Nosebleed's digital grind-power violence-hardcore turns into ""whatever"" in just a short period of time. Their credo revolves around bringing glory to the sacred deity of speed and grind, while their profane lyrics flicker with fury and pomposity. At least I assume they do, as they don't feel the need to provide the listener with written lyrics for this 2xCD reissue, which encompasses everything they did prior to their first Relapse record, <i>Honky Reduction.</i></p><p>
    
    Recording for Relapse, ANb grew restless with their standard grind sound and released <i>Frozen Corpse Stuffed With Dope with all of its strange digital flourishes and <em>Altered States of America</em> with of all its two-second tracks. <em>Bestial Machinery</em></i> represents a purer time when the sorcery of a machine was being harnessed because of ANb's inability to find a drummer of suitable speed. It's definitely not ""straight"" grindcore but it's also not drastically different from any album that colorful reviewers call ""filled to the brim with buzz saw guitars that cut like a rusty bayonet through the ripe flesh of venereal diseased Vietnamese hookers."" You've heard many albums like it, but in an  established hardcore genre it's not whether you break the formula, it's whether you can give it enough attitude to make it interesting. ANb have a little bit of attitude-- and a bunch of kickass cartoon devils and skulls on their cover! I could see this cover art being photocopied and plastered on some notebooks at school, right under someone's hand drawn Slayer logo. It's that good.</p><p>
    
    Disc One contains 76 tracks-- taken from various 7-inch records and splits-- of flailing guitars and cathartic screaming, while the drum machine farts off non-stop double bass. It's not metaphysics or anything, but with titles such as ""From Filth to Defilement"", ""The Newlyweds Are Raped"", and ""The Executioner Vs. The Sodomite"", it's just good, wholesome Satan-influenced stuff. There are 60 more songs on Disc Two. The demos on Disc Two sag due to their lackluster mixing and production, while compilation tracks seem misplaced.</p><p>
    
    Most grind snaps you into attention at the beginning then you either catch the groove (if you can call it that) or you tune it out in an ambient fashion and let your mind wander. <i>Bestial Machinery</i> mixes the two and turns into a sort of interesting drone. It's not bad music as far as this goes, it just isn't filled with one interesting idea after another, which is what is usually needed to be completely engrossed. After a little while it simply turns into ""whatever."" But it's a really loud and fast whatever.</p></div>"|479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/479-bestial-machinery-vol-1/|7.1|Austin Gaines

Chalk the suprising success up to a supportive art community, high literacy rates, or the nation's awe-inspiring natural beauty, but not everyone in Reykjavik is totally happy with this alt-oligarchy. Enter folk outfit Without Gravity, a band whose jingoist press releases call for an indie revolt to show the world what Icelandic music's really about-- simple, American grass-roots folk.</p><p>
    Denouncing many of their compatriots for aiming simply to ""outweird each other,"" Without Gravity at least has an admirable goal. In the tradition of European folksters Donovan or Nick Drake, Without Gravity borrows heavily from the American country/folk rock scene; yet while those 1960s-bred artists looked to Dylan, Without Gravity settles for passing as a fatigued Iron &amp; Wine.</p><p>
    Single-name vocalist Kalli (What? No accent or umlaut?!) leads a lumberjack version of the Hives, keeping the music simple, the wardrobe plaid and denim, and the message clear and repetitious; guy gets sad, guy retreats to nature for introspection, guy feels redeemed. To further homogenize matters, each song's arrangement and intensity is virtually identical. Two acoustics, upright bass, and pussyfoot percussion, making for one powerful 45-minute elephant tranquilizer of oceans, skies, rivers, and birds rallying around choruses like, ""Where have you gone?/ What have I done?"" and ""It's been far too long/ It's been far too cold.""</p><p>
    If these guys want credit for breaking from your country's traditionally ambient, experimental artists, they can have their kudos, but it's a Pyrrhic victory. For all their rabble-rousing ambitions, <em>Tenderfoot</em> succeeds only in capturing an aesthetic at its most structural. Fortunately, Without Gravity doesn't overtly cater to the adult contemporary crowd, save for some misused mandolins and strings. However, if there were a distinctive, single-worthy song here, you'd probably be looking at Iceland's Grammy-friendly answer to David Gray. As is, it seems the great Icelandic folk takeover falls flat on its face, and the title of ""Third Most Popular Icelander"" still rests safely in the hands of, oh let's just say, Prime Minister Halldór \xC1sgrí2msson?</p></div>"|8797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8797-tenderfoot/|4.0|Adam Moerder

    new <em>The Difference Between Houses and Homes bills itself-- invite
    commentary on everything but the music. The overlooked tracks at hand
    are, more often than not, acknowledged duds. They get left behind for
    a reason. So what's the redeeming value of the albums that compile
    them? It's the artifact, man. History! Put yourself in the shoes of
    Omaha denizens Cursive. You've been together for 10 years. How better
    to calcify your status as Important Band than with an odds-and-sods
    compilation? It's practically a rite of passage.</em></p><p>
    
    Behold, a snapshot: <em>The Difference Between Houses and Homes offers
    12 songs, culled from seven-inches and unreleased tape, spanning
    six years (1995-2001). I like Cursive, and had high hopes for this
    one. But the spendthrift in me blows a gasket when faced with the
    facts: These cast-asides aren't even offered at a discount; you'll pay
    the same for this as you did for </em><em>The Ugly Organ</em>, Cursive's latest and
    best studio album. Love to say it's worth it for a glimpse at
    <em>evolution in progress</em>, but this offal doesn't make for much of
    a menu dilemma: Given the choice, most folks will order the rib-eye
    over the hangar steak.</p><p>
    
    Expectedly, the longest lost tracks (talking '95, '96) are the most
    amateurish. Stripped of the heady orchestral accouterments of the
    band's post-millenial work, opener ""Dispenser"" is all splintery emo
    (not emo) angst. (Here I must tell TextEdit to learn, for the eight
    billionth time, the cuss; how many Fall Out Boys will it take for the
    world to recognize the emo phenomenon?) ""Pivotal"", from 1998's
    ""Icebreaker"" seven-inch, is the same song, only minor-keyed and more
    convolutedly structured. Both numbers do everything they're supposed
    to: Take a riff, ruffle it with distortion, add a melodramatic vocal,
    and eu-fucking-reka.</p><p>
    
    I have a high tolerance for vocal histrionics, but Tim Kasher has made
    a career of getting under listeners' skin, and <em>The Difference</em> finds
    him at his most unabashed. On ""There's a Coldest Day in Every Year"",
    he struggles to pilot the shapeless, vaguely psychedelic music. But
    it's songs like ""The Knowledgeable Hasbeens"", which require an indoor
    voice, that give Kasher the most trouble. I have no hang-ups with a
    vocalist ""hiding"" behind screaming; I wish this one would do so more
    often. But while Kasher's vox are rarely less than vociferous, his
    stilted delivery (a now-prevalent, mockingly hoarse style of which he
    was a progenitor) actually helps: It can be hilariously entertaining
    to hear him pitch a hissy, especially when it sounds like he's
    screaming, ""REGGAETON! REGGAETON!"" as on ""A Disruption in the Normal
    Swing of Things"".</p><p>
    
    On balance, however, Kasher is less violent than silent. He leaves
    gaping voids for his band to fill, and they do, ably but often
    meanderingly. Clint Schnase has been Cursive's drummer since the
    band's inception and, while he does a serviceable job, I wish he'd
    erupt with more colossal, tom-heavy fills. Here he's tight and
    tasteful but mixed too high to justify the asceticism of his playing.
    The band's latter-day, fatter-budget albums have added reverb and
    instruments, diminishing any one player's import. A song like
    ""Nostalgia"", however, from 2001, would benefit from a slightly more
    rhythmically technical treatment, even if that would spell
    E-M-O-C-O-R-E.</p><p>
    
    While collections like this aren't spared critical dissection, their real
    job is to get fans excited (again) about the issuing group. I have
    more than a few friends who would kill for my promo (to enter a
    lottery, email ubl@pitchforkmedia.com). Can't say <em>The Difference
    Between Houses and Homes</em> had me thirsting for my Cursive faves,
    although it came close: I now have this weird craving to hear Braid's
    ""Eulalia, Eulalia"". Man, that takes skill.</p></div>"|1702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1702-the-difference-between-houses-and-homes/|6.3|Sam Ubl

These songs are dark and cold, and their August release-- sent squirting out into an expanse of rotting, hundred-plus days, drifting over boiled trash and limp, floppy gardens-- proves oddly apt. All the chills you'll feel will finally do some good.</p><p>
    Holopaw's juxtapositions may be less striking now, but the results are more cohesive. Still, <i>Quit</i> takes a little extra time to settle into: Without being purposefully difficult, <em>Quit +/or Fight</em> can still be willfully (and successfully) obtuse, scrappy and determinably distanced from the shiny perfection of <em>Holopaw</em>. Since 2003, the band has added another guitar player (Tom Reno of Florida post-rockers the Mercury Program), and with members currently scattered from their former home base of Gainesville, FL, Holopaw has adopted the increasingly popular U.S.P.S. method of sound recording, drifting ideas back and forth from producer Mike Pecchio's studio in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Philadelphia, Florida, and elsewhere. Whimsical and charmingly slack, <em>Quit +/or Fight</em> harnesses that distance to create a record intensely sympathetic to gaps in place and time.</p><p>
    Opener ""Losing Light"" is all pause and thumping drums, punctuated by prickly guitar lines and overdubbed vocals-- singer/lyricist John Orth (also of Isaac Brock side-project Ugly Cassanova) encapsulates late December with awkward, crushing intimacy, his voice drifting from half-whisper to full-song: ""The tree from the house to the curb/ Tinsel pathways to the yard...We're losing light/ The holiday, whittled down to this/ Plenty of time winding out."" Orth hits all the seasonal notes, from sugar plums to corduroys to fake snow to space heaters, but also manages to capture (at times, majestically) the glorious, scarf-wrapping loneliness inherent to deep freeze.</p><p>
    ""Velveteen (All Is Bright.)"" is painfully transformative and one of the band's strongest tracks to date: Michael Johnson's cymbal swats crack and whimper like icicles shattering, filled in by Tobi Echevarria's thick, loping bass (think snowshoes) and Jeff Hays' wispy, hot-breath-on-cold-air pedal steel. Orth coos earnestly about Santa Claus steering his reindeer straight to the bottom of Lake Superior (""Without a thought he said 'Go Dasher, Go Dancer'/ And they dropped their heads, disappeared into the cloudbank...Those silver bells didn't make a sound when they fell to rest at the bottom of Superior""), which seems like a precious conceit, until you stop thinking about it and just listen to his poem: slowly, the song tumbles towards a thundering climax, all heavy, honking synths, and guitar push, Orth bellowing fervently ""All is calm/ All is bright/ And they're dragging the lake with peppermint hooks, pink rushing to frostbite tips""-- before slinking back into the band's signature closing hush. </p><p>
    Unsurprisingly, <em>Quit +/or Fight</em> is also a breakup record, heavy with heartache and dark, belly-punching bits. Orth always had a photographer's sense of detail and light, and here, watching becomes an essential thematic reprise. In ""Curious"", a lover is shakily peered at from a clearing, and in ""Losing Light"", Orth's eyes turn to a sleeping body: ""I watch you like some newborn kid/ Curling your fingers in and out of fists/ Run my thumb across your hip."" Things aren't good (""I'm lost to you""), but Orth is veiled and careful with his details, immersing listeners in the fuzzy, shaking haze of endings. </p><p>
    Musically, the band stretches its muscle: ""3-Shy-Clubs"" funnels mysterious percussive smacks into a groove-heavy bossa nova rhythm, while ""Curious"" folds in bass clarinet and sinewy falsetto. The title track originally appeared as a FOUND Magazine (publisher of found notes, letters, photographs, and stories) song of the month, and features a mess of snagged lyric crumbs, cobbled together into a shockingly logical whole (some of which seems like an eerily apropos PTSD response to military propaganda: ""OK, so I'm no longer/ The best of the best/ No longer defending the U.S.A."") Still, the track, which mixes tinkling bells with steel guitar caws and high, layered harmonies, has moments of chilly clarity: ""You've done enough/ Quit and/or Fight,"" Orth implores.

    sub-name and (sort of) a new band. On the 10th anniversary of the
    founding of Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Melting Paraiso U.F.O., it came
    time for Makoto to re-energize the project. As he writes in the liner
    notes of this release, after countless records and constant touring, ""I began to feel
    the need for some powerful, new force that could stand against the
    virtually extinct dinosaur of Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Melting Paraiso
    U.F.O., a worthy rival who could read the last rites to the corpse.""
    Inspired, Makoto took the band from his solo Mothers of Invasion
    project
    and transformed them into Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Cosmic Inferno.</p><p>
    
    You might find all this a bit odd when you consider that Acid Mothers
    Temple &amp; the Melting Paraiso U.F.O. itself had a regularly shifting
    lineup, and that some musicians here are common to both bands. As a
    cosmic traveler from another generation once said, ""If you get
    confused,
    listen to the music play."" The guitar on the two long (long) tracks is
    immediately identifiable as Makoto in heavy (heavy) riff mode. ""Trigger
    In Trigger Out"" opens with a short wisp of drone and then launches into
    a primordial blooze-rock riff that's only a couple parsecs in AMT
    space-time from ZZ Top's ""Tush"". From this simple guitar stomp Makoto
    goes positively apeshit, exploring every harmonic corner suggested by
    the chords with a torrent of acid-drenched and fiercely wha-wha'd
    notes.
    While Makoto solos his way into the setting sun, returning to the riff
    every five minutes or so as if to refuel, bass and drums hammer the
    hook
    home and crude analog synths pan rapidly between the speakers.
    Occasional voices howl from somewhere in the distance, offering some
    approximation of what it must have sounded like when Jefferson Airplane
    played a free concert in Golden Gate Park...from four blocks away.</p><p>
    
    ""Trigger In Trigger Out"" pushes past 20 minutes, which is slightly
    insane when you consider the energy level sustained throughout, but
    ""They're Coming from the Cosmic Inferno"" is the real straightjacket
    material. Forty-four minutes this one goes on for, and again
    nearly
    all space is filled with balls-out soloing. The riff is less a focus
    here. As the band locks into an unyielding metronomic krautrock groove,
    Makoto takes a free form and less blues-based approach, letting his
    leads go where they want to go.</p><p>
    
    The biggest problem with the record is the sound quality. The band is
    obviously playing live in studio and Makoto is credited as the
    engineer,
    so that could be part of the problem right there. In a sense the tinny
    and muddy nature of the production seems natural to the music,
    suggesting a connection to, say, the early 70s Zappa bootlegs that
    probably take up an entire wall of Makoto's apartment. But the guitar
    heaviness that seems so crucial isn't what it could be, and the other
    instruments get lost in the mix. The problem is alleviated somewhat
    when
    you listen at extreme volume (everything sounds better loud, but this
    record makes no sense otherwise). Still, if you can stomach
    the epic length and don't feel a headache coming on, there's something
    special happening. Though the snarling music projects a certain
    ugliness
    and undeniable aggression, the band's ultimate m.o. is transformative
    ecstasy achieved through profound disorientation. If the Cosmic Inferno
    catches you in the right mood, they just might get you there.</p></div>"|25.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/25-just-another-band-from-the-cosmic-inferno/|7.3|Mark Richardson

    the
    most prolific bands on the planet, kicking out albums, live recordings,
    EPs,
    compilations, and boxed sets. It's almost as if disbanding or the
    thought of
    disbanding (they never actually got around to it) made them realize how
    much
    they liked being in the band, relative lack of commercial success be
    damned.
     Since that initial flood of releases, the un-broken-up Posies-- which,
    it
    should be noted, is just a shorthand for John Auer and Ken
    Stringfellow-- have been much quieter, and after plenty of
    time
    lending their talents to other bands, including the reunited Big Star,
    they've finally dropped their sixth studio album.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the wait comes to a fairly unsatisfying end, with <em>Every
    Kind
    of Light</em> largely failing live up to the band's original run. It's not
    a
    terrible, but it doesn't exactly play to their
    strengths,
    either. Indeed, it seems as though Auer &amp; Stringfellow are somewhat
    preoccupied with proving that they rock,
    and it comes at the expense of the effortless hook-craft of <em>Frosting on
    the
    Beater</em> and <em>Success</em>. <em>Frosting...</em> represents the band's commercial (and,
    for
    me, creative) peak, and it seems as though they're reaching back to
    that
    sound on a lot of these songs, but in the wrong order. Whereas the
    crunchiness of that record was incidental, the volume cranked high in
    the
    service of the songwriting, in this case, the guys seem to be writing
    the
    songs to fit the volume they want to play at, a strategy that doesn't
    work
    nearly as well.</p><p>
    
    So you get self-conscious rockers like ""I Finally Found a Jungle I
    Like"", a
    flailing song with novelty lyrics and a horn part that references the
    Who's
    ""5:15"" but that's way too busy and graceless to leave a lasting impact.
    ""All in a Day's Work"" similarly pounds away with tons of distortion but
    forgets to offer anything memorable. If
    that were the whole story, the record would be an unqualified mess, but
    thankfully, the Posies are too good to make an entire album of
    uninspired
    goop. You can hear echoes of the band's past glory in the exquisite
    verse melody of ""I Guess You're Right"" and the thundering, Moog-tinged
    rocket ride of ""Second Time Around"", the album's only song that strives for their trademark heavy pop rush and actually nails it.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, album opener ""It's Great to Be Here Again"" is a fascinating foray into a humid, claustrophobic r&amp;b; sound, with guitars and
    mellotrons
    trading off the ominous countermelodies while Auer and Stringfellow
    interweave their vocals with their usual deftness. Auer's effortlessly
    melodic ballad ""Conversations"" is another highlight, featuring soft
    verse/loud chorus grunge dynamics that should feel played out by now,
    but
    actually work perfectly. Stringfellow gets in his own nice ballad with
    the
    alcohol-soaked ""Last Crawl"", a song that reflects a lot of his recent
    solo
    work with its smooth AM gold sheen.</p><p>
    
    So it's not the jaw-dropping affirmation of the Posies' non-break-up
    that we
    might have hoped for, but <em>Every Kind of Light</em> is ultimately a decent
    record
    spiked with a few classic moments of patent posies pop ecstasy. Fans
    will
    want to have it, for sure, but everyone else can just wander through
    the
    back catalog to <em>Frosting...</em> or the <em>Dream All Day</em> compilation. The
    Posies
    may not be what they once were, but, if only for the handful of great
    songs
    they offer here, I'm glad they're still around.</p></div>"|6429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6429-every-kind-of-light/|6.8|Joe Tangari

With the post-punk party currently in the thick of its heaving, cash-in-reunion stage (a precursor to the inevitable ""Real World vs. Road Rules""-style cannibalization), the foursome tries to reinvigorate the bash by throwing out the straight-on kick-drum angularity of their EP and enrolling in a hazy art class where Dave Thomas visually represents skewed entropy by throwing Mark E. Smith through a sugar-glass window. Hardly melodic and not adventurous or invigorating enough to pull off the scuzzy brassiness of its yelping forefathers, the Nein get all anguished and pissed as it alternates between grubby grunge slow jams and lo-fi oom-pah on <em>Wrath of Circuits</em>.</p><p>
    
    Much of the group's murkiness can be credited to the addition of samples guy Dale Flattum, who sprays utterly random noises all over the album, diluting its semi-weak impact in the process. On ""The Vibe"" we get aquarium bubble pops, atonal video game bleeps, and a plinky keyboard loop, but instead of somehow adding a much-needed fresh Faustian dimension to the song, the found sounds highlight its aimlessness. With Flattum's tape wrangling a constant distraction, inconspicuously snarling singer Finn Cohen seems to be holding back from truly unleashing a wail worthy of the best posting and punking. His largely incomprehensible musings on relationships and technology make Trail of Dead's similarly themed <em>Source Tags &amp; Codes</em> seem like an unbridled lyrical masterpiece.</p><p>
    
    Fittingly, the ""oh oh"" chorus of the relatively lucid, hi-hat stomping ""Lost Sounds"" provides brief respite from the purveying sub-Sparta At the Drive In spin-off crud. Proving once again that the Nein would be better off without their own muddle butt Jim O'Rourke causing an unrequited mess, the spare ""Bleeding Elvis"" is a fine smooth-burning ballad Trent Reznor would love to cry about. Just try to ignore the words--""I had to replace those integers with impossible functions and irrational combinations leading to more furtive glances""-- which are headache causing pseudo-computer puzzles nobody wants to crack.</p><p>
    
    Excess is usually something post-punks don't have time to worry about-- and it should stay that way. Though they're clearly (desperately) trying to initiate their own neo-post branch, the Nein don't have the tunes or the funk or the strut to break free from the surplus sonic ballyhoo that engulfs much of <em>Circuits</em>. Maybe they should have just copied Gang of Four. More.</p></div>"|5917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5917-wrath-of-circuits/|5.1|Ryan Dombal

    bought this collection in its first week of release-- could be wrong,
    though I think it's more likely that the group outside of those 8K are
    the ones with the loose screws. After all, a two-disc best-of
    collection from a performer with more than 150 million records sold
    worldwide is bound to have better sales numbers than the latest volume
    of <em>Now That's What I Call Music!</em>. But
    the majority of those millions were sold years ago, before (most of)
    the plastic surgeries, the 30-foot statue floating
    down the Thames, the gold-plated baseball equipment, the crotch
    grabbing, the ethnic slurs, the baby dangling, and the countless
    accusations of child molestation. Suffice it to say that any pop
    capital Michael Jackson accrued during his reign as the self-appointed
    King of Pop has long been spent. However, as these two discs ably 
    show,
    his honorarium was, for a time, actually justified.</p><p>
    
    For most folk, Disc One might be more than enough MJ. The disc covers
    the meat of Jackson's career, starting with the Jackson 5, and ending
    with the title track from <em>Thriller</em>. Anyone that doesn't know
    ""ABC"" or ""I Want You Back"" must be deaf, and anyone that doesn't enjoy
    these songs must be dead. Pitchfork staffer Tom Breihan will be happy
    to know that ""The Love You Save"" is included-- it's the J5 #1 that 
    never
    gets any play, and it might be the best of the bunch. Of course, as
    much as Jackson is all about the finger-snapping funky dance stuff, 
    he's
    also about the treacly ballad, so instead of ""I'll Be There"", there's
    ""Got To Be There"", which really shouldn't be anywhere. And then 
    there's
    ""Ben"", a song about a boy and his homicidal rat that touched the lives
    of both Crispin Glover and Eddie Vedder. Yay for the skip button,
    because right after that roadblock comes great unsung tracks from the
    Jacksons, like ""Blame It On the Boogie"", and the ubiquitous Quincy 
    Jones
    collaborations that made Jackson a legend.</p><p>
    
    The final 12 tracks of Disc One are comprised with cuts from <em>Off
    The Wall</em> and <em>Thriller</em>, including all seven Top Ten singles
    from the latter album. The importance of <em>Thriller</em> can't be
    understated, musically or otherwise-- 27x platinum in 
    the
    U.S. alone, ushered in the age of milking albums for all they're worth,
    helped dimwits at MTV realize that having popular black artists on 
    their
    nascent network might be a good idea, gave John Landis a chance to do
    more werewolf stuff-- but it's the <em>Off The Wall</em> tracks that 
    shine
    brightest. The triple-threat of ""Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,"" 
    ""Rock
    With You"", and ""Off The Wall"" hinted at the effortless pop hopscotch
    Jackson would execute on the next record. <em>Thriller</em> does manage to
    make the Beatles and heavy metal (and, um, monster movies) hold hands
    like BFFs-- no easy feat in the early 1980s, regardless of who's doing
    it-- but it could take years of distance and brainwashing for ""Beat It""
    or ""Billie Jean"" to shake off their played-out flavor. Hearing ""Thriller""
    away from the zombie chorus line is interesting, though, if only 
    because
    one comes to realize that a song about being pursued by 40-eyed
    behemoths actually made CBS a boatload of cash. Of course, the title
    track's success came in the wake of a song that goes from a refrain of
    ""You're just a buffet/ You're a vegetable"" to a coda of tribal
    chanting, which goes to show how off-the-wall <em>Thriller</em> actually
    was.</p><p>
    
    In light of what Disc One offers, Disc Two will invariably disappoint,
    just as the 8x platinum <em>Bad</em> was a disappointment in the
    wake of the unparalleled success of <em>Thiller</em>. With hindsight, it's hard not to see the songs from <em>Bad</em> in an
    unflattering light. As Tom B. noted in his write-up regarding the
    Michael Jackson box-set, this is where all the tics and affectations
    that people think of when they think of Michael Jackson came to roost-- not five seconds pass without an unwarranted ""shamon"" or ""hee-hee"" or
    hiccup or ""woo"". While <em>Bad</em> boasted more #1 hits than its
    predecessor-- ah, the joy of riding coattails-- most of the singles are
    just lesser versions of <em>Thriller</em> tracks. ""Bad"" is a beat-down
    ""Beat It"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" is a tepid rehash of ""P.Y.T."", and
    the hamfisted seduction in ""Dirty Diana"" is light years from the
    alluring ambiguity of ""Billie Jean"". And then there's ""Man 
    in
    the Mirror"", wherein the King reacquires his taste for schmaltzy
    sub-""Ben"" balladry, now cutting it with a need to ""make that change"" 
    for
    the sake of the entire human race. It might be simply a matter of a
    failed negotiations, but it's no small blessing that ""We Are the World""
    is far, far, far away from this collection. Unfortunately, no such 
    boon
    kept the chirpy and grointastic ""Black Or White"" off the board.</p><p>
    
    That said, the second disc does right by Jackson, culling quality 
    tracks
    from the sparse smattering of original material that followed That
    Album, and all the non-musical nonsense that surrounded this music.
    Without such selectivity, an interested novice would be better served
    just grabbing <em>Off The Wall</em> and <em>Thriller</em>. Instead,
    <em>Bad</em>'s gorgeous ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" and neglected <em>Dangerous</em> single ""In The Closet"" receive
    their deserved moment. Even the DOA single from his latest album, ""You
    Rock My World"", sounds surprisingly spry. Being far removed from that
    awful video featuring Marlon Brando's corpse and Michael Tucker as
    Mini-MJ helps, just as getting the hell away from Iman and Eddie Murphy
    does wonders for ""Remember the Time"". Therein lies the rub of 
    Jackson's
    career-- as fantastic a performer, songwriter, and singer he is, people
    at large are going to remember Michael Jackson more for his Wacko Jacko
    public persona than for his exemplary body of work. Given recent
    events, the backlash is understandable, but in regards to the actual
    music being offered here, it's a damn shame.</p></div>"|4351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4351-the-essential-michael-jackson/|8.7|David Raposa

The Aphex Twin     mastermind's first project since 2001's perplexing <i>Drukqs</i> started promisingly enough, albeit expensively, with the 40 quid     <i>Analord 10</i> last December. However, subsequent offerings in this     procession of 12-inches have raised disconcerting questions: Why is     one of the 90s most enduring electronic musicians splitting so much     time between 80s electro and the sound of his own early-career     <i>Analogue Bubblebath</i> efforts? Is he washed up, or just     acid-washed? Taking us to the cleaners?</p>
<p>As of the sixth, seventh, and eight <i>Analord</i> installments, James     seems more TB-303 now than man, twisted and primeval. These insistent,     repetitive analogue compositions are almost perversely anachronistic,     a robot curled up in the fetal position rather than the conqueror of     new colonies we'd once come to expect. The multi-layered beats of     <i>Drukqs</i> persist, but the glistening melodies that set apart the     Twin's finest work are, after burbling just beneath the surface of     some early <i>Analord</i> tracks, all too infrequent in this batch.</p>
<p>Much of <i>Analord 6</i> will be familiar to anyone who's heard its predecessors. ""Batine Acid"" plies rote acid lines with intermittent     spookiness, ""Snivel Chew"" adds sawtooth synths and rapid handclaps,     and ""2 Analogue Talks"" at least mixes things up with squeaky,     high-pitched scales giving way to the monotonous, clock-like donging     of what sounds like a horn sample. Standout ""I'm Self Employed""     suggests that whatever James is up to, he's not just going through the     motions-- at least not always. Fragile, lonely melodies and     countermelodies reminiscent of his ambient works build     into a rust-eyed chorus and actually take it somewhere.</p>
<p><i>Analord 7</i> kicks off with the (deceptively?) straightforward     acid-house of ""Lisbon Acid"", which bloops, thumps, fuzzes, squelches,     and ultimately meanders for an entire side. The echoey off-key     synths of ""Pitcard"" start and stop on a dime, which is better than a     nickel (worth more, too!). The ""AFX Acid 04"" evokes almost an acid     remix of Spoon's ""I Turn My Camera On"" with its slinky changes and     martial pace, before giving way to ominously discordant skarronking.</p>
<p>The tracks on <i>Analord 8</i> are named for computer viruses, likely     in an effort to discourage file-sharers. Then again, the pieces might     have been so named because a few are among the series' most infectious     so far. Awash in disco hi-hats, ""PWSteal.Ldpinch.D"" beckons with the     type of decidedly non-digital lust, come-hither bass line, and slightly     detuned hooks that a Kylie Minogue could have taken upchart.

Perhaps it could be said that there are hints of this same celestial guidance at work in the ethereal music of West Philly's Tara Burke, aka Fursaxa. Drawing inspiration from Hildegard's hypnotic medieval plainchants, as well as from a host of other ancient folk and psychedelic traditions, Fursaxa's fourth official full-length <em>Lepidoptera</em> ripples and flutters with an enthralling mantric pulse uniquely its own.</p><p>
    
    With previous albums released by Acid Mothers Temple and on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace, as well as appearances on such compilations as this year's epochal <i>By the Fruits You Shall Know the Roots</i>, Burke has managed to associate herself with the ongoing free-folk movement. But, as is the case with contemporaries like Charalambides or Tower Recordings, Fursaxa utilizes folk music's essential ingredients-- acoustic guitars, hand percussion, simple, repetitive melodies-- in a such a deeply personalized (and wholly unpredictable) fashion that she's able to construct enchanted new meadows of sound that exist completely beyond any reductive classification.</p><p>
    
    Centered predominantly upon Burke's multi-tracked, endlessly coiled vocals and the steady hum of vintage keyboards, Fursaxa also bears comparison to Nico's <i>The Marble Index</i> and, especially, to the post-Opal solo work of Kendra Smith. As with those performers, Burke often tends to prefer arrangements that feature their instruments one or two at a time, with tracks like ""Russian Snow Queen"" carried along solely upon the steady current of a single pump organ and her swirling, wraith-like vocal loops. Despite their humble settings, however, the songs of <em>Lepidoptera</em> attain an astonishing degree of richness and tranquil warmth, possessing a depth of field unheard on earlier Fursaxa releases like 2000's <em>Mandrake</em>.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the album, Burke's lyrics (such as they may be) remain stubbornly inscrutable, but on tracks like the opening convocation of ""Freedom"" her cascading, self-replicating harmonies render her actual words superfluous. And on the primitive campfire rounds of ""Velada"", ""Neon Lights"", or the expansive, sublime ""Poppy Opera"", one can't help be transfixed by the way her gently dividing melodies continually circle back on their tails, as Burke uses raised fingers to trace infinity symbols across the constellations, sounding for all the world like that feather carried aloft by unseen hands.</p></div>"|3343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3343-lepidoptera/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

It seems to be the ""post Swans drone"" period. That's nice because it walks a thin line with being the ""I'm gonna release whatever experimental bullshit I feel like because I own a record label"" period. Luckily, two decades of quality drone and repetition under the Swans moniker, has made Gira a master of the two.</p><p>
<em>The Body Lovers</em> was originally released in 1998 with the subtitle Disc 1 of 3. It was eventually followed by <i>The Body Haters</i>. Since then Gira has focused on the song-oriented Angels of Light project and the chaperoning of freak-folkers Devandra Barnhart and the Akron/Family.</p><p>
    
    Gira has now packaged his hour-long-song period with a 10 minute bonus track and expanded artwork full of swine and human sex organs. <em>The Body Lovers</em> is 73 minutes (segued into 10 tracks) of semi-calculated instrumentation-- the kind that doesn't find the artist jacking off with the EQ or sampler to their hearts content. It starts with what sounds like the distant chimes of gamelan music reverberating around a cavern and then morphs into a different winding style every eight minutes or so. There are funeral dirges, shimmering and floating guitars, crescendos reminiscent of Godspeed You Black Emperor, impenetrable walls of stretched notes, austere jangle, samples of crying babies and weeping women, and only one minute of Gira singing. It's all attention holding and it's very reminiscent of what the Swans were trying on <em>Soundtracks for the Blind, which is fitting since parts of </em><em>Body Lovers were culled from sound samples dating back to 1982. The rest is from the standard Swans crew like Jarboe, Bill Rieflin, and Larry Mullins, while members of Pan Sonic, Origami, and Deathprod also make contributions.</em></p><p>
    
    While <em>The Body Lovers pulls disparate sounds together into one enthralling hour, </em><em>The Body Haters just wanders around in some gloom and doom for 36 minutes. It simply sounds like Gira indulged in some looping software and did some half-assed processing. The bonus track is 10 minutes of instantly recognizable bits of Swans songs chopped up and layered on top of each other. </em><em>The Body Haters isn't crap, it just pales in comparison to everything else Gira has done and therefore sounds very amateurish. But I'll allow a few mistakes in two decades of high quality mind warping music.</em></p><p>
    
    If it's just repetitive droning, what makes <em>The Body Lovers</em> so good? It's because Gira has consistently made atmospheric music that doesn't take you into the atmosphere. It doesn't invite you to escape reality. It suffocates you with the not so comforting truths of humanity, without causing introspection, retrospection, or even speculation. The emotions are so strong yet so indistinct that half the Swans fans you'll meet can't make a cohesive argument as to why they listen to them. If Gira can cause all this enigmatic wonder in an hour-long piece without his trademark lyrics then he must truly be making special music...The catch is that it only works at night.

    hoax: They constructed an apocryphal protest narrative around their
    2002 <em>Oxxxes</em> LP, and released a fake split with Arab on Radar
    that pissed off the entire experimental-hardcore community (all ten
    members of it). The knee-jerk reaction is to write off these
    boondoggles as publicity stunts; more realistically, they seem to
    stem from an abiding sense of playfulness: ""Let's see what'll happen
    if we do <em>this</em>."" How many extra records are you going to sell
    for pretending to be Arab on Radar, anyway?</p><p>
    
    In another counterintuitive turn, the band known for their long,
    absurd song titles seems to have omitted them entirely from their
    latest EP. This could scan as a rejection of song-as-bio-fodder, a
    tacit manifesto stating that music belongs to the moment, not the
    museum. The stance would dovetail nicely with the fact that Oxes
    really occur in the ephemeral live setting, and remain unable to
    accurately translate their visceral shows to the album format. The
    five songs on <em>Oxes EP</em> are brambly, muscular math-metal slabs,
    but listening to pre-recorded versions of them is like looking at
    graffiti in an art gallery. The execution is remarkable, the lines
    expressive, the colors vibrant, but they lose something vital without
    the world clamoring around them.</p><p>
    
    Still, Oxes manage to put a unique spin on math-rock and metal. Let's
    be frank: Math-rock is some boring, noodly-ass shit that, by packing
    ""surprises"" into every abrupt meter and dynamic shift, completely
    squanders its capacity to surprise. Oxes focus on math-rock's
    bodily, combustible potential and turn it into drunken party music,
    never forgetting which part of the genre's name is the modifier and
    which is the foundation. The bluesy metal vamp of the first track
    never squanders a shred of momentum for forced complexity, and the
    second is a twisted Southern rock shredfest that's intricate without
    being cerebral. </p><p>
    
    While American metal often resorts to vague tropes of Germanic
    fascism, Oxes forgo guttural vocals and jackbooted cadences in
    favor a metal that sounds drenched in American pride. This
    faux-jingoism really comes to the fore on the fourth track, with its
    anthemic stomp and satirically patriotic guitar lead that echoes
    Hendrix's incensed ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". This blend of
    bombast and belligerence undercuts the entire album (ironically, but
    with a vitality that would shame Toby Keith), barring the final track,
    which bends toward a compressed, gnarly sort of Krautrock. If it isn't
    a breakthrough record, <em>Oxes EP</em> is another solid entry from a
    band that refuses to abandon the sense of play and mischief that rock
    music threatens to lose as it vies for space in the safe havens of
    glossy column inches. </p></div>"|6077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6077-oxes-ep/|6.9|Brian Howe

Four guys from down-and-out Queens adopted a common surname and the same juvenile delinquent uniforms as they blasted short, simple, sublime pop songs from cramped stages. Eventually some of the brothers-in-arms became bitter enemies. When Johnny stole his girl, Joey didn't fight him at the lockers, but wrote ""The KKK Took My Baby Away"". Therein lies a large part of the Ramones' charm: they made rock music with bored kids in mind, with short-attention-span song lengths, blunt guitar riffs, and unsophisticated lyrics. The band was self-aware, sure, but the Ramones always seemed genuinely invested in what might seem like the shallowest eddies of pop culture. In the process, they tapped the essence of rock music in its purest form.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the movement the Ramones helped to jumpstart quickly got away from them, turning their practiced naivete into impractical nihilism. Their desperate hopes for mainstream popularity, which showed through in their professionalism and dogged work ethic, were dashed when the Sex Pistols made the new style a four-letter word. Instead of taking over the airwaves, they became a cult band, but always seemed too big for such a diminutive label. As their contemporaries imploded or exploded, the Ramones maintained a surprisingly consistent pace, continuously putting out albums but refusing to expand their sound too far beyond the template they established on their self-titled debut. The Ramones were the anti-Beatles: they resisted musical growth and maturation, and we're all the better for it.</p><p>
    
    Collecting 85 songs from 20 years, <em>Weird Tales of the Ramones</em>, which Johnny helped to curate, reveals just how little the Ramones' sound changed and just how little that mattered. Every song, from the first track (""Blitzkrieg Bop"") through the last (""R.A.M.O.N.E.S.""), shares the same basic elements: sharp, fast guitar riffs; punchy momentum; driving tempos; and handclaps or sha-la-las or some other nod to pre-album rock pop music. The Ramones' aesthetic has become such common currency, though, that it's easy to forget how raw they could sound, how tough and tender, how just a handful of elements could be recast in infinite variations.</p><p>
    
    If they were reluctant to evolve their sound, the Ramones constantly tested its flexibility. Phil Spector gives ""Do You Remember Rock and Roll Radio?"" the wall-of-sound treatment, and ""Rock and Roll High School"" is basically a revved-up Beach Boys song. In the 1990s, they covered Tom Waits (""I Don't Want to Grow Up""), the Who (""Substitute""), the Amboy Dukes (""Journey to the Center of the Mind""), and Love (""7 and 7 Is""), but best of all is their webslingin' version of the original ""Spider-Man"" theme, which originally appeared on the 1995 compilation <em>Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits.</em></p><p>
    
    Like most box sets these days, <em>Weird Tales</em> is a multimedia package. A DVD contains all of their videos, most of them embedded in a 1990 program that includes short interviews with contemporaries (Debbie Harry, Tina Weymouth) and fans (former New York Yankees pitcher Dave Righetti, who doesn't seem to get the band). Most of the videos are just silly enough to fit with the Ramones' particular aesthetic, although ""Something to Believe In"" is a hilarious parody of stuffy mid-80s <i>USA for Africa self-seriousness.</i></p><p>
    
    But this box set's real attraction, aside from the music, is the packaging, which includes a thick comic book inked by several artists including Mary Fleener (<i>Life of the Party), Bill Griffith (<em>Zippy the Pinhead</em></i>), John Holmstrom (two Ramones album covers), and Sergio Aragones, whose work in <em>Mad</em> magazine was influential to the Ramones specifically and to early New York punk in general. Despite the reliance on the questionable narrative that the Ramones destroyed synthetic disco and bloated arena rock (which is truer as a personal listener reaction than as rock history), the comics avoid self-serving remembrances by fawning devotees and fussy rock-critic exegeses that often sanitize subversive artists. These strips are informative, imaginative, and-- oh yeah-- pretty damn funny. Moreover, this art form is the inky equivalent of the Ramones' music and image-- their scuffed Chucks, ripped jeans, Mickey Mouse t-shirts, and outlandish haircuts-- and reinforces their aura of permanent adolescence.</p><p>
    
    This sort of inspired cleverness keeps <em>Weird Tales</em> from eulogizing the Ramones or, worse, explaining away their mighty mysteries. And perhaps their lack of mainstream success during their lifetimes ensured a larger and posthumous triumph: in the thirty years since their debut, several generations of listeners have connected with their music in a very personal way without the interference of institutionalized nostalgia. <em>Weird Tales</em> makes it possible for future generations of pinheads, dropouts, glue-sniffers, brats, cretins, mama's boys, and punk-punk-punk rockers to discover the Ramones as if for the very first time. Gabba gabba hey!

No, it's a package deal. Even with three-four hitters Cam'ron and LaRon ""Juelz Santana"" Jones skewing the group average, Dipset has its acknowledged bench players. But with most products of its kind coming off as second-stringer pity parties, <em>More Than Music</em> is generously well apportioned, complete with assiduous rapping, pricey beats, and packaging that wasn't printed on a cousin's Epson.</p><p>
    
    For New York crews, mere proliferation isn't good enough; world domination is more their speed. Dipset has similarly high-minded ambitions, and if you've missed its highfalutin talk of spearheading a new Harlem Renaissance, the title track clarifies: Amid thunder claps, a sermoning voice announces, ""In the beginning of this movement, it was all a dream. The passion...the dedication...the persistence...TO ACHIEVE GREATNESS."" Talk of movements is hardly cutting edge, but Dipset infuses even its fluffiest shit-talkin' with ungodly energy. To hear the opener's stony, swelling strings is to feel the world shifting beneath your feet.</p><p>
    
    But how much of this is just ""Final Countdown"" quixotism? Depending on who's blogging, a lot or more. Is Dipset the most galvanizing crew in hip hop, or another peacocking cadre? Yes. All that chest puffing is part of what makes them so gripping. Juelz Santana calls himself ""crack in the flesh"" and his best tracks make you believe it. Cam specializes in corner talk, but his is a unique breed, full of doublespeak, circular logic, and fantastical imagery. He scampers around boilerplate topics like a jester, abstracting and obstructing like he's too smart to help it. Even those apprenticed to the head honchos are coming up strong. So, cardboard moralists dismiss at will, but Dipset outstrips the species norm by a crosstown block.</p><p>
    
    Above all, Dippers be thuggin' to the sound of Dips-- all razoring strings, airtight beats, and clenched-teeth deliveries. That sound is a shot of stanozolol wherever <em>MTM</em> threatens to wane, which is often enough. Believe it or not, at 67 minutes, the album has some soft spots. But the triumphant opener ""Dipset Symphony"" is not such a spot. More rag than symphony, the track rides a rickety piano roll while 16's fly by at a frantic clip. (Featuring no fewer than six emcees and the hypeman's bloviating inside of three minutes, it's the album's busiest number.) No one quite steals the show, but Santana christens the melee (""All eyes on the honorable. Who?/ Dipset, back to the grill again. Live at the barbeque."").</p><p>
    
    Among the understudies, J.R. Writer is my frontrunner to crash the big leagues. He takes ""You Make Me Say"", a bittersweet, 6/8-feel beat from Heatmakerz, and delivers Cam-lean verses in his own, edgier voice (""See you draped in designer wear/ Nice clothes/ Like those?/ I'll take you to buy a pair/ Where? That's Paris to Milan/ Fill your bag up with Vuitton/ You the baddest and the bomb/ Understand, I'm a rapper with some charm/ Don't worry 'bout the little groupies grabbing on my arm""). Close behind Writer may be recent Dipset newie (and charter female member) Jha Jha. She spits on the immaculate ""So Gangsta"", which samples Aalon Butler's 1977 semi-classic ""Rock and Roll Gangster"". Unlike, say, Three 6 Mafia's Gangsta Boo, who reaches down into her belly for her rhymes, Jha isn't afraid of the higher registers.</p><p>
    
    Considering the typically slipshod nature of these things-- and a scant three appearances from Cam'ron-- <em>More Than Music</em> should be worse. But Dipset economized-- the album is low on skits (there's only one) and superstar cameos (again, only one, as Fabolous drops in on Santana's thrilling ""What's It Gon' Be"")-- to make room for its lesser-known emcees. When blessed with the type of talent Dipset has among its top brass, that kind of generosity is heartening. When the fledglings deliver like sturdy blue-chippers, that's astonishing. Dipset group hug (no homo).</p></div>"|2620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2620-more-than-music-vol-1/|7.7|Sam Ubl

    bands must surely be running dry, what with
    us coming close to two full decades of CD-Age
    vault-plundering and with multitudes of internet sites
    cratedigging for the next forgotten masterpiece. So
    rather than continuing to look for those artists that
    sold 11 copies of their wildly influential debut
    record before imploding, perhaps we should be
    re-appraising bands that have been right under our
    nose all the time, almost annoyingly so.</p><p>
    
    Electric Light Orchestra is one of those ubiquitous
    bands that could be due for a second glance, a concept
    that briefly gained some momentum when ""Mr. Blue Sky""
    all of a sudden became mandatory accompaniment for
    Charlie Kaufman-scripted films. However, a number of
    elements appear to be aligned against any sort of
    serious, non-kitschy ELO revival: 1) That absurd (yet
    appropriate!) name, 2) The incredibly Muppetish
    appearance of frontman Jeff Lynne, and 3) The group's
    all too easily parodied and carbon-dated sound, with
    its liberal use of falsetto and classical strings.</p><p>
    
    But the things that so firmly attach ELO to a
    particular time in music history (the 1970s) are also
    the things that make them so uniquely great. ELO
    existed at a point in music history where I was
    brought up to imagine the armies of rock and disco
    locked in a mortal battle like the Cubs and Cardinals,
    wherein the two flavors were mutually exclusive to
    apartheid-like extremes thanks to fun things like
    racism and homophobia and fear of keyboards. New- ave
    compilations have somewhat dissuaded me of that
    notion, but the field of what is now classic rock most
    assuredly remained a genre that surely treated the
    influx of disco's dance beats and string arrangements
    as straight heresy, and it was against this backdrop
    that ELO made its heroic stand.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Lynne's bold mixing of the disco and
    the rock seems almost accidental in retrospect--
    books tell me that disco didn't peak until the
    mid-seventies, while the self-titled first ELO album
    hit stores in 1971, so the chronology doesn't quite
    match up. The original vision for the Electric Light
    Orchestra was rather coarsely telegraphed by their
    name: a merger of pop, rock, and classical music that
    yielded some pretty embarrassing early moments (including the
    Beethoven/Berry mash-up of ""Roll Over Beethoven"", not
    included here) and some pretty great ones (rock +
    opera aria = ""Rockaria!"", included). Early on, Lynne
    and co. made music that was sky-high on excess, drunk
    on the ambitious precedent set by the Beatles and the
    fact that, wow, studios have that many tracks to work
    with now?!</p><p>
    
    So it was pretty much serendipity when, by the middle
    of the decade, classical-sounding strings were
    suddenly a hot property thanks the burgeoning disco
    scene, Walter Murphy's ""A Fifth of Beethoven"" even
    echoing ELO's own attempts to update old Ludwig van.
    To Lynne's credit, he didn't follow his rock peers in
    mocking the new dance sound, but rather embraced the
    accidental resemblance, recording the group's best
    singles (""Evil Woman"", ""Living Thing"", ""Telephone
    Line"") in an extravagant and non-condescending fusion
    of disco and rock. Only the Bee Gees were able to
    ride the wave of fashion more profitably, though each
    band's success should hardly be held against
    them...there's a reason why both are still heard on the
    radio incessantly.</p><p>
    
    All of the above makes ELO an excellent greatest hits
    band, as there's not a whole lot to be found in the
    deep cuts of albums like <em>Out of the Blue</em> and <i>Face the
    Music. It's appropriate then, that there are
    numerous ELO greatest hits sets already
    available, with <em>All Over the
    World</em> only the latest entry. Truthfully, it's
    fairly interchangeable with the other comps
    already on the market, covering the band's
    less-rewarding backbeat-obsessed early period through
    the heady disco days described above through to the
    proggier late-70s work which birthed ""Mr. Blue Sky""
    (and it's lesser-known sibling ""The Diary of Horace
    Wimp""). Only two reasonable complaints can be lodged:
    the baffling omission of choice slow jam ""Can't Get It
    Out of My Head"", and the pointless
    just-barely-two-discs length.</i></p><p>
    
    It's a bit difficult to argue the
    cred-bolstering relevance of ELO in 2005, given that
    it's practically impossible to find a current band
    that sounds anything like Mr. Lynne's studio
    concoction. Pushed to the wall, I'd probably argue
    for the importance of ELO in paving the way for what
    we're now referring to as ""hyperprog,"" the condition
    of idea/instrument abundance employed by bands like
    The Fiery Furnaces and Head of Femur. Yet none of
    these bands possess that essential quality of pure
    excess that sets ELO apart, that coke-infused sheen I
    associate with the 70s thanks to P.T. Anderson films
    and VH-1 documentaries. Based off this second-hand knowledge, Electric Light Orchestra are
    about as perfect a sound representation of that era as
    you're bound to find...and that makes them a band worth
    remembering.</p></div>"|2934.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2934-all-over-the-world-the-very-best-of-electric-light-orchestra/|7.7|Rob Mitchum

For seven years they've Snuffleupagussed themselves into fans' hearts by setting saccharine folk-pop in a lysergic fantasyland of sasquatches, werewolves, and other assorted bugaboos. Yet even at their most far-fetched offerings, the band's only elicited a mere chuckle and slap on the wrist from critics. That's the perk of possessing one of the most soothing lullaby voices this side of Stuart Murdoch, and singer Jonathan Scott knows it.</p><p>
    
    On 2002's <em>Out Like a Lamb</em>, Scott finally cashed in on his stirring voice and keen pop sensibilities by ebbing his New Age fixations and utilizing a full band. For better or worse, <em>Shaded Lodge</em> marks a return to the cauldron for the Lions as studio wizard David Jackson and Scott collaborate to conjure up more kooky things that go bump in the night. However,
    ""kooky"" for the Lions is hardly an Olivia Tremor Control or even Flaming Lips brand of quirky pop, but rather stripped down Simon and Garfunkel acoustic ditties drenched in reverb and the occasional sound effect.</p><p>
    
    Despite the eerie blips and screeches, <em>Out Like a Lamb</em> is the only thing really haunting this record. The tracklist's split between sprightly indie pop and drowsy, woebegone folk. Opener ""Shame Magic in the Night Galley"" takes a ginger step towards ebullient pop but it's reserved and simplistic sound portends the downcast mood swing to come. ""Watch the Skies / A Boy's Life"" follows the tradition of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" both musically and lyrically, though cumbersome images of Arthurian adventure convolute its message: ""Let's smash the magic wonder window...in the halls of Abel's fault."" I mean, the stagnant melody's uninspiring enough, but who'd actually rally around the credo ""Snuff the mortal candelabra's light""?</p><p>
    
    Luckily tracks like ""Destroyer of the West"" and ""Satanic Blood"" stand as the white knights in this tale. The former features Elliott Smith/Cass McCombs hybrid vocals coupled with jangly guitar almost slow enough to pass as shoegazer. Yeah, ""Satanic Blood"" is another ""Just Like Heaven"" permutation, but Scott's raspy vocals greatly contrasts Robert Smith's, and these days who <em>isn't</em> hitching ersatz Cure tracks to their albums for good measure? After all, immediacy like this makes Scott's seven-minute doldrums somewhat worth the wait. However, while fantastical lyrics and <em>Lord of the Rings</em> settings may buy you time when ideas are lacking, as Scott himself sings, add too much filler and ""the hexagon and necroworm won't wait.""</p></div>"|2621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2621-shaded-lodge-and-mausoleum/|6.6|Adam Moerder

    blizzard began the night before and lasted until about noon that
    day, so attendance was sparse. At the time, I was into Jesus
    Lizard, Big Black, Helmet, Laughing Hyenas, and Swans, so I dodged
    drifts and got a place in front (not that there was much competition).
    As my feet thawed (I remember puddles of water), I was blown away by
    the volumes attained by these three NYC musicians: I lost track of
    individual songs, but the set was mostly culled from their 1991
    Matador debut, the one with a decapitated guy bleeding across a train
    track.</p><p>
    
    Live, besides the sheer brutality, I was struck by the gnarly,
    distorted vocals of guitarist Chris Spencer and the chaotic,
    body-shot drums of Charles Ondras. (Sadly, later the same year, Ondras
    died of a drug overdose, and was replaced by former Foetus/Swans
    drummer Vincent Signorelli.) For me, that night was Unsane at its
    peak, but even after I stopped paying attention, the Lower
    East Side noise-rock trio kept going (and going).</p><p>
    
    In fact, the band's history is more extensive than one might guess: In
    1992, Matador released a compilation of early singles and compilation
    tracks. In 1993, that label inked its infamous distribution deal with
    Atlantic, which found Unsane connected to a major label for album
    three, <em>Total Destruction</em>, produced by Martin Bisi. In
    1995, the band signed to Amphetamine Reptile for <em>Scattered, Smothered,
    and Covered</em> and hooked into a tour with Slayer. After years of intense
    touring, Unsane released <em>Occupational Hazard</em> in 1998 on Relapse. That
    same year, Spencer was beaten close to death by four anti-American
    Viennese thugs while in Austria. He recovered, but the band called it
    quits in 2000.</p><p>
    
    Now, 13 years after I was introduced to their live rage,
    Unsane's in my apartment with a collection of new material, their
    first since <em>Occupational Hazard</em>. Spencer remains on vocals
    and guitar and Signorelli's still on drums. Original bassist, Peter
    Shore left in 1994 and his replacement, Dave Curran continues to
    provide the heavy, often nimble low-end.</p><p>
<em>Blood Run</em> doesn't diverge from the Unsane salad days. Even the gory
    cover continues the tradition of packaging the work in hyper-saturated
    crime-scenes. ""Blood Run"" itself is a term Spencer gave for the band's
    quick moving photo shoots. Because they often occur in borrowed/public
    spaces, he and his associates set up the shot, pour the the blood,
    quickly depart wherever it is they're shooting (warehouse, etc.)
    before the cops come. The new, too-obviously staged pic
    isn't as creepy as the old stuff, but it does show a naked tattooed
    girl, i.e. linking it to the whole Suicide Girl thing. (Hey, it's one
    way to remain current.)</p><p>
    
    The production's crisper than the first two albums, but otherwise, the
    distorted vocals, drill-sergeant lyrics (""Can't break. Get straight.
    Too Late. Dead weight""), pummeling drums, bassy bass, and
    bluesy/sheet-rock guitars could've been recorded a decade ago. Think
    stripped-down Laughing Hyenas on ""Got It Down"" and ""Recovery"" or
    Helmet sans Branca name-drop just about anywhere else. There's little
    variation. Introductory movements or openings fall into different
    camps-- solo drums, solo guitar, solo bass-- but after that, each
    piece becomes the same sludgy formulation. Moments of difference: 1)
    Guest semi-metal guitar solos on ""Hammered Out"" and ""Latch"", and 2) A
    seven-minute closer, ""Dead Weight"", which introduces more drone and
    sustain than usual, but quickly falls into line, then ends with the
    sounds of a subway coming to a stop, perhaps crushing a head.</p><p>
<em>Blood Run</em> offers a visceral kick in small doses.
    (Try one track and then leave the room for 15 minutes. Repeat.)
    The purist in me even kinda wants to extend a hand to the boys for
    sticking to a template so relentlessly. But come on, while Unsane
    hasn't lost a step, it hasn't gained anything either. And in the end,
    as in the beginning, the lack of a sneak-attack and attendant
    shock/awe spells death for a band whose relevance hinges on arriving
    like a 2 a.m., tooth-chipping sucker punch.</p></div>"|8386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8386-blood-run/|5.0|Brandon Stosuy

Each of the album's tracks was created using a single commercial product that Herbert found objectionable. Selections included ""Nike"" and ""Television"" and ""Gap"", along with food-themed offerings like ""Coca-Cola"" and ""McDonalds"". </em><em>The Mechanics of Deconstruction was a curious artifact, moving Herbert's hypercritical pop art into a more overt realm, and, best of all, it was a free download. You could (and still can) pluck the tracks off the web and then listen while reading along with one of Herbert's anti-corporate rants. It wasn't a great record by any stretch but it was certainly novel, and enjoyable to a large extent because of Herbert's genius with sampling and arrangement.</em></p><p>
    
    The fire inside that motivated Herbert to create ""Starbucks Is Coming"" from <i>Mechanics-- a track made by manipulating, recording, and processing one caramel latte and one Frappucino-- still burns. <em>Plat du Jour</em> shares a lot with the earlier Radio Boy record, only this times the methods and arrangements are far more sophisticated and the critical guns are trained solely on the globalized corporate food industry including, again, Starbucks. Per the record's website, ""An Empire of Coffee"" contains a sample of ""60 Vietnamese robusta beans being dropped in to an empty container of monsanto-made roundup weedkiller."" The figure is chosen because 60 beans is the approximate number used to create a shot of Starbucks espresso.</i></p><p>
    
    With Herbert, I've always been happy to consider the political content of the records to be a clever bonus, while the music as a purely sonic experience is allowed to stand on its own. I listened to <em>Plat du Jour</em> five or six times without paying attention to the song titles and not having read the online methodological descriptions, and this one didn't hold up quite so well. Opener ""The Truncated Life of a Modern Industrialised Chicken"" has impressively dense production, juggling macro and micro samples (field recordings of massive coops of terrified chickens are heard alongside eggs bumping into Pyrex bowls to create bell-like tones). But the musical elements-- the way with chords and melody that set the highly trained Herbert apart-- fail to add anything substantial, and we're left with an OK mid-tempo electronica tune. ""These Branded Waters"" is similarly forgettable, with a music box arrangement of manipulated samples of Dasani water bottles that's brings to mind a middling electro-twee act.</p><p>
    
    The songs that work best are faster and let Herbert indulge his skill for propulsive rhythm. The aforementioned ""An Empire of Coffee"" has some heavily caffeinated peaks where all the man's weird noises coalesce beautifully into a cartoon bump machine. The music on ""Hidden Sugars"" goes well with its title and theme, as it sounds like something Tim Burton might've incorporated into his film of <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, highly mechanized but playful and candy-striped, with vague hints of menace lurking in there somewhere. ""White Bread, Brown Bread"" is as funky as a package of onion kulcha a week past its sell-by date. The album's lone vocal track, ""Celebrity"", on the other hand, is a smug indictment of celebrity food endorsements, with an embarrassing chorus that ends with ""Go Beyonce! Go Beyonce!""</p><p>
    
    Maybe here the album is only half the art. Maybe one needs to go to the accompanying website, read how the pieces were made, and contemplate the state of the modern agriculture industry to really experience what Herbert is getting at. If that's true, who exactly is the audience for this sort of thing? What advantage do these songs have over an essay? I've read <i>Fast Food Nation, enjoyed it, and I haven't had a hamburger, McDonald's or otherwise, in three or four years (though the Schlosser book had nothing to do with me quitting beef). But nothing in the music feels connected to any feelings I have toward the food industry. Surely, in the end we have to judge the music as music, and Herbert has done a lot better.</i></p></div>"|3836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3836-plat-du-jour/|6.1|Mark Richardson

Talk about <em>The Golden Morning Breaks</em>, though, and you'll find yourself stuck talking about nothing more abstract or general than the instruments used to make these sounds-- the bells and the proto-cellos, the cathedral ambience, and the 19th century glass glockenspiel.</p><p>
    And sure, a lot of albums are all about sound. But what sets this one apart is how natural it is about that agenda: This is the rare variety of abstracted, post-electronic New-Music recording that's almost entirely its own creature. (Sounds like? Sounds like beautiful bells!) On Colleen's last album, Cécile Schott crafted the same delicate drifts from ghostly samples and found sounds, but that just kept it all rooted in our common vocabulary of German sound artists and laptop soundscapers. With this album, she's left sampling behind entirely, crafting elegant, barely-there compositions from the pure timbres of instruments old and, well, old; will it surprise anyone that the album's title comes from the work of a 17th century lute virtuoso?</p><p>
    So maybe you get something like Fennesz unplugged, or the Georgian-era chamber version of Kompakt's <em>Pop Ambient</em> discs-- but then maybe you don't. Where your laptop dreamers turn their attention to the crackles and the staticky thunderstorms that hover around their music, Schott composes; the incredible ""Summer Water"" spends most of its time pushing strings into ever-so-slightly different arrangements, each new interval shading new colors onto the looping lute figure in the center. And where electronic ambience fills the stereo spectrum with one immersive swell of sound, Colleen sits closer to Brian Eno's original vision of it-- she's interested in the way these instruments can play delicate harmonic figures without ever gathering them up into linear form. Funnily enough, it's her most organized pieces that are both the most unique and the easiest to like; it's when she weaves farthest out into the abstract and the formless that she starts to sound most like something you've heard elsewhere.</p><p>
    But only 15% of your brain is following <em>what</em> the instruments are playing. The other 85% is soaking in the pure sound of their reverberations-- the secret-garden chime of ""The Heart Harmonicon"", the harbor-spanning organ of ""The Happy Sea"", the rounded pluck of the lute and the pearly fog that drifts behind it. The strange part is that Schott's all-natural recordings and endlessly-pretty harmonic shifts make this album far more accessible than you'd ever dream; PC technicians rarely get this musically hospitable, and I'm not sure who on the modern-composition New Music side gets quite this relaxed and generous. (I'm not sure which of them would put a fairy-nuzzling unicorn on an album cover, either.)</p><p>
    Oh, it's still abstract. Even if you love it, you may struggle to find the appropriate moments to really spend with it-- how much time do you set aside each week to sit quietly with your eyes closed and think about all the different qualities of light you could imagine when you were a child? And if you're not particularly inclined to that beautiful pure-sound formlessness, Colleen's moves in the opposite direction still might not make this much more than some glorious wallpaper-- not the worst role, but not the best Colleen can take. Because at its most effective, this album is kinda everything it should be, and everything we should ask: Something simple, beautiful, and coherent, something that feels remarkably imaginative but entirely unpremeditated. If I didn't have bills to pay and a kitchen to clean, I'd be all over it.</p></div>"|1744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1744-the-golden-morning-breaks/|8.0|Nitsuh Abebe

Alaskan! bassist Russ Pollard played in Lou Barlow's post-Dino group Sebadoh from 1997 until 2000, and singer/guitarist Imaad Wasif toured with another Barlow project, the Folk Implosion. But the exclamation point-enhanced trio isn't really an oddball choice for touring buddies: while they don't share Dinosaur Jr's penchant for messy, genre-busting musical chaos, alaska! has a similar potential for controlled noise: at its best the trio churn guitar-grinfing maelstroms that sound barely contained.</p><p>
    
    That potential, unfortunately, is not entirely realized on their second album, <em>Rescue Through Tomahawk, which sounds all too contained. Musically, it's frenetic in all the right ways: The rhythm section-- Pollard and former Red Aunts drummer Lesley Ishino-- moves agilely across a range of dynamics, from quiet to loud on the gradually building ""Surrender"", from slow to fast on ""The Light"", from gentle to harsh on almost every track. Throughout </em><em>Rescue Through Tomahawk Imaad Wasif's guitar weaves menacingly, adding a darkly hesitant intro to ""Through the Years"" and a triumphant coda to ""Surrender"". When alaska! plays like an instrumental band, it proves surprisingly formidable: a little subtler than Kinski, a little less abstract than the equally exclamatory Godspeed You! Black Emperor, a little less brutal than Mogwai.</em></p><p>
    
    However, alaska! isn't an instrumental band; lyrics and vocals dominate their songs. Wasif proves a perfectly adequate singer: his gravelly voice tends toward expressive overenunciation and to-the-rafters projection, and his trippily oblique lyrics lean more toward eerie evocativeness than outright clarity. But really, vocals and lyrics are the least interesting aspects of this album; Wasif doesn't say anything on <em>Rescue Through Tomahawk that the band doesn't state more clearly, concisely, and compellingly through its wound-tight sound, its clockwork interplay of instruments, and the friction between styles and musical elements.</em></p><p>
    
    The songs seem hemmed in by their devotion to Wasif's lyrical structures, and often the attempt to subvert them creates some intriguingly, if unintentionally, tense moments. Pollard kicks out a bassline on ""Real Is Your Control"" that bounces like French pop, and it gives the song an unexpected punch. The guitar solo on ""A Fury of Trees"" plays like an outro, at least until Wasif comes in again with one last verse, but really, the frenetic momentum sounds like the song's one true reason for being. Likewise, most of these songs sound somehow clipped, like they want to cut loose and stretch and sprawl well beyond their imposed limitations.</p></div>"|97.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/97-rescue-through-tomahawk/|6.6|Stephen M.

    singles like ""Bullets"" and ""Munich"". In modern terms, Editors aren't the
    conspicuous nostalgia of the Stills, but they don't quite have the jittery
    bluster of bands like Maxímo Park, lying somewhere in between the two.</p><p>
<em>The Back Room</em> puts its best foot forward with the first three
    tracks, played with more than enough verve to compensate for their
    limited borrowed palette. Vocalist/guitarist Tom Smith sings in a forceful
    but wavering voice, like Paul Banks on the edge of distraction. On opener
    ""Lights"", the guitars move from standard jangle and reverb-heavy
    single notes into punctuating, echo-laden scrapes, recalling the work
    of U2's the Edge.</p><p>
    Editors occasionally match a catchy vocal line with an energetic
    performance, like the speedy picking and memorable vocals in the chorus of
    ""Munich"" or the insistent rhythm of ""Blood"". More often, it's the
    performance that overshadows the minimal melody. When the tempos slow,
    the album gets ponderous, and <em>The Back Room</em> puts three
    melodramatic slow songs smack dab in its center. ""Fall"" features listless
    strumming over stark bass and drums, while Smith's drawn out-phrasing leads the
    band to slow-burning catharsis-- truth be told, Editors sounds more like
    Interpol than anyone else, and their mockingbird act betrays a lack of confidence needed to pull off their tortured
    posturing.</p><p>
    Quick tempos return on ""Fingers in the Factory"", one of the disc's
    strongest performances, but momentum has been lost and the remaining
    songs are aimless. ""Fingers in the Factory"" is most memorable for it's
    stomping chorus, with voice drums and guitars all hitting the same
    staccato notes, but the same gimmick falls flat elsewhere. ""Bullets"" relies
    on forceful repetition for a hook, belting ""you don't need this disease""
    over and over while the band cranks it up, but the dynamics are lost
    without a melody.</p><p>
    Editors sound like an earnest rock band who grew up loving the same
    bands as the current batch of revivalists, but beyond the workmanlike interpretations of their heroes,
    it's hard to swallow. Editors often imitate bands with
    dramatic vocalists like Ian Curtis or Ian McCulloch, but the best moments on
    <em>The Back Room</em> aren't the theatrical ones-- it's when the four of
    them are playing and discovering their own chemistry.</p></div>"|2933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2933-the-back-room/|6.0|Jason Crock

    for another run around VH-1. But the snake has eaten its tail, folks: Singing about the power of
    song doesn't necessarily make a song powerful.</p><p>
    
    What makes a song powerful? Why, simple guitars that start quiet and
    grow loud, of course. On ""Final Broadcast"", ""No Promises"", ""At the
    End"", and ""10/22"", Dalley has those in spades-- in clubs too,
    check local listings! In addition to powerful this makes the songs
    emotional, which may be why Statistics sound like Sunny Day Real
    Estate and the aforementioned Jimmy Eat World (and the unmentioned Mineral Jealous
    Gloria Waxwing Theory). ""A Foreword"" jumps from Sunny Day's murky ""In
    Circles"" to Weezer's spirited ""Suzanne"". ""Begging to Be Heard"" has the
    chimey guitar lead thing from Smashing Pumpkins' ""Today"" or
    Statistics' ""Grass Is Always Greener"", but it doesn't get all
    distorted like-- wait, there it goes. The big echoey half-falsetto
    call/response chorus of ""No Promises"" kills in Omaha! Dramatic drum
    fill, wham pow boomshaka. Statistics aren't ""emo"", because that trip
    was all about honesty and Statistics <em>Often Lie</em>-- nice one.</p><p>
    
    Pitchfork's Rob Mitchum once wrote, ""Get me Tamborello!"" That was
    about another Desaparecidos co-songwriter. Well, Dalley does
    things himself. Along with shimmery synths, aimless IDM blips, beats,
    bleats and nauseating buzzes dot the productions-- particularly ""By(e)
    Now"" (almost as clever as last album's ""Chairman of the Bored"")-- like
    a post-Postal Service pox. Statistics' debut was heavy on messy
    experimental tracks, but now Dalley mostly focuses on the
    songs.</p></div>"|7731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7731-often-lie/|1.0|Marc Hogan

His name is Ron Lewis, and by day he's a cheesemonger. (Folks, you can't make this stuff up.) But buck up, would-be Bonhams: There are more exciting outfits to get down with, bands that change tempo, use odd meter, leave space for rip-roarin' tom rolls. Fruit Bats, not so much; they traffic in power-pop without the crunch and speed-- or, in brainchild Eric Johnson's ambitious mind, the hypothetical link-up of Holy Modal Rounders and <em>Rumours</em>-era Fleetwood Mac.</p><p>
    
    Ron Lewis, I hereby charge you, sir, with making these fine songwriters less fucking facile. I want you to bring a brick of oozy stilton to rehearsal and let that sucker stink up these folk-poppers' cleanly confections.</p><p>
    
    If you want a tutorial in how to render well-written songs flaccid and boring, pick up <em>Spelled in Bones</em>. Critics bray about ""trimming the fat"" but that's specious; fat is good! Fat is French! Fruit Bats could use some flab; even the title track, a groggy wisp of a ballad that <em>should</em> drag on ad infinitum, wraps up in under four minutes. Where are the tumescent guitar peals, the reverb-drowned vocals, the bombastic drums? There is no two-part coda. Worse, no trumpet fanfare. Mr. Lewis, you have a tough road to hoe.</p><p>
    
    But you're ideal for the job. Johnson retains his affinity for spic-and-span 70s pop-- the kind that put newspaper in the bass drum, sat Elton John at the keys, and was tooled on a microbiotic level. But what John and the Macs (both Fleetwood and P. __Cartney) lacked in daring, they more than made up for in cheese. So it's to the Fruit Bats' credit that they chose a replacement skins-hitter who actually peddles the stuff.</p><p>
<em>Spelled in Bones</em> doesn't achieve Rounders-<em>Rumours</em> synthesis, but it does successfully update arena fro-yo by excising the coke-fed navel-gazing. Where their forebears slung self-absorbed musings from a druggy maw, Johnson's words harmonize with the Bats' docility.</p><p>
    
    Fruit Bats previously got pleasant with a pair of sleepy Brian Deck-produced slabs, 2001's <em>Echolocation and 2003's Sub Pop debut </em><em>Mouthfuls. But </em><em>Spelled in Bones</em>, their most polished effort, teeters near soporific. And that's a shame, because it houses some of the band's best songs. Though the consistency of instrumentation, volume, and tempo invite the ear to wander, there are jags of awesomeness. Amid so much swooshing fluidity, the closing vocal repetition on ""Silent Life"" is almost defiant. Listless ballad ""TV Waves"" is jolted by a chugging, hi-hat driven pickup, which, beneath melty guitar peals (finally), gives the illusion of double-time. Johnson's vox are polite and low-key mostly, which is why his sudden unblanketing of a sultry falsetto on ""Born in the '70s"" is both a much-needed spark and a tease.</p><p>
    
    Instead of paying homage to the megastars of a bygone era-- whose sound comes naturally but whose spirit remains evasive-- Fruit Bats should focus on where they fit in among active analogues. For Pete's sake, they're on Sup Pop. With a loosened-up approach Johnson could put himself in a league with A.C. Newman and labelmates the Shins. As for newcomer Lewis: Bring it, kid. Better that the new pup shit all over the rug than hide behind the couch all day.</p></div>"|3230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3230-spelled-in-bones/|6.3|Sam Ubl

In fact, screw everything, they're one of the greatest rock bands period, up there with any classic rock dinosaur you care to name. And though it's tempting to launch an essay on the racism of rock radio-- or rock journalism for that matter-- I'll stick to the band. Even as they're revered as legends and purveyors of the some of the best funk of the 70s, I've read relatively few accounts on their greatness as a pure rock band. But they had it all: great players, great singers, a great look, a great concept, actual hits, great albums, great drugs, freaky sex, disputes over money-- everything Led Zeppelin (or Spinal Tap) taught us was necessary to make the world's greatest rock music.</p>
<p>They started small, backing up ringleader George Clinton's Parliaments in the late 60s. When Clinton got into arguments with his label Revilot over money and rights, he decided to start recording his backup band instead, using the original Parliaments singers (Clinton, Ray Davis, Clarence ""Fuzzy"" Haskins-- and come on, dude's name is ""Fuzzy""-- Calvin Simon and Grady Thomas) as ""guests."" Guitarists Eddie Hazel and Tawl Ross, bassist Billy Nelson, drummer Tiki Fulwood, and eventually, master keyboardist Bernie Worrell were the band that would turn this fairly traditional soul group into the intense live act that wowed Detroit's Westbound Records head Armen Boladian. He signed them, and from the get-go, their music cut through genres and money bullshit like neither had ever existed. Never mind that half the band quit and came back again during recording sessions for their first record, Funkadelic was destined for greatness. Ace's reissues of the band's Westbound catalog is long overdue-- they sound a world better than the terribly mastered original CD pressings, and contain a wealth of bonus tracks, alternate mixes, and liner notes.</p>
<p><i>Funkadelic</i> from 1970 was a bomb dropped all over rock and soul. No matter Hendrix, no matter James Brown, no matter the MC5, nobody had ever heard anything like this. This music was slower than sludge, dirtier than the ""raw funk"" Herb ""Sparky"" Sparkman talks about in ""Music For My Mother"". It was a great big fucking mess, and a lot of people didn't know what to make of it. I remember reading a <i>Rolling Stone</i> review from the time that ended with ""who needs this shit?"" and a writer from the <i>Blues &amp; Soul</i> 'zine from a year later admitted, ""Funkadelic has never been one of my favorite R&amp;B; acts"". Still, the record sold (peaking at #16 on the Soul LPs chart), and planted the seed of a cult worship that would balloon in the latter half of the decade, making the P-Funk enterprise the most successful soul act on the planet.</p>
<p>""Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?"" started out with the sound of Clinton's wet mouth and the best ever opening line for an album: ""If you will suck my soul, I will lick your funky emotions."" When the beat hits with Hazel's guitar line, there can be no doubt that Funkadelic were without peer as far as this stuff was concerned. This stuff-- hell, tunes like ""Mommy"" and ""Good Old Music"" are slams to the gut as powerful as anything Zep ever did, and with beats to spare. ""Music For My Mother"" is like a Southern myth, detailing a loner's travels through ""Keep Runnin' Mississippi"", hearing music he thought long dead, yet getting trapped by its sticky black allure. ""What Is Soul?"" drops more classic lines (""soul is a hamhock in your cornflakes,"" ""Soul is chitlins foo young,"" ""soul is a joint rolled in toilet paper"") in seven minutes than most bands muster up in a career. Bonus tracks like the tight instrumental ""As Good As I Can Feel"" and several single versions of album cuts make this album one of the most indispensable of all indispensable Funkadelic records.</p>
<p>Even as <i>Funkadelic</i> was an inspired statement, it wasn't exactly a coherent one, especially as most of the band had quit and come back again during the recording sessions. Their second record, 1971's <i>Free Your Mind</i> was the first (of only two) records done by the core unit from start to finish-- albeit, according to Clinton, one recorded in the span of a single day, while everyone was tripping. Compared to the debut, it's a lot more ""rock"" and a little less ""soul."" The opening track ""Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow"" was like a Sly Stone jam gone haywire, with fuzzed out guitar and bass, distorto-organ, and spoken, chanted or otherwise freaked vox appearing all over the mix. ""Friday Night, August 14th"", ""Funky Dollar Bill"", and ""I Wanna Know If It's Good to You"" were a bit tighter, and a lot harder. ""Funky Dollar Bill"" features another down-home-on-a-porch-and-an-amp-with-probably-some-pot-and-other-things guitar riff from Hazel and Clinton and company sounding completely fucked up and screaming out at you from the depths of the stereo on lines like ""you don't buy a life, you live a life, a father learns much too late-- HE WAS A-NEVER HOME!!"" ""Euology and Light"" is like a lysergic Lord's Prayer, replete with backwards choir. The bonus track ""Fish, Chips and Sweat"" is again reminiscent of Sly, but in his ""Dance to the Music"" guise, and is suitably celebratory, even as the mix distorts the tape.</p>
<p>And then they got serious: <i>Maggot Brain, released in the July of the same year, is the peak of the Funkadelic experience. The songs jam harder, the way out stuff is way fucking out there. Seriously, how many dimensions is Hazel traveling through on the instrumental title cut? His 10-minute guitar soliloquy is a spiraling model of the blues filtered through a psychedelic lens, and almost single-handedly places him in a realm with Hendrix, Jimmy Page, and Eric Clapton as one of the great classic rock guitarists. But it got better: ""Super Stupid"" was the tale of a dumbass junkie set to a tune Black Sabbath would have been proud of; ""Hit It And Quit It"" is a funk anthem where keyboardist Worrell gets his licks in and the beat turns around a dozen times before we hit the chorus; ""Can You Get to That"" is honest-to-whoever pop that showed Funkadelic could be serious from time to time, especially when it came to social commentary (and also featured Isaac Hayes' female background singers, giving it a classic soul sheen), and ""Wars of Armageddon"" (recently, wisely used by Optimo on the </i><i>Psyche Out</i> mix) is a knock-out-drag-down fight to the death between the world's best rhythm section and paranoid, psychedelic sound effects and crowd sounds. <i>Maggot Brain</i> was an explosive record, bursting at the seams with exactly the kind of larger than life sound a band called Funkadelic should have made.</p>
<p>Too bad most of the band left afterwards. Tiki Fulwood was fired due to drugs getting in the way of his reliability as a band member; Tawl Ross reportedly got into an ""acid eating contest, then snorting some raw speed, before completely flipping out,"" per Billy Nelson, and has not performed professionally since; Nelson himself quit over a money dispute with Clinton, leaving only Hazel and Worrell from the original Funkadelic lineup. Drummer Tyrone Lampkin replaced Fulwood, while guitarist Gary Shider (who'd already played with the band on parts of <i>Maggot Brain</i>) came aboard to fill out the sound. However, a lot of folks would look at former JBs like Phelps and William ""Bootsy"" Collins additions as the most significant. Certainly, Bootsy's mark on the whole Parliafunkadelicmint thang would eventually be almost as strong as Clinton's.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, 1972's <i>America Eats Its Young</i> is a disparate, schizophrenic record. Despite Clinton's efforts to produce a record that would have a better chance at crossover appeal than the first three Funkadelic records, like many double LPs, there's simply too much material, and too many conflicting directions to really make this seem anything other than a Frankenstein production. Of course, it has its classics: ""Loose Booty"" and ""A Joyful Process"" are the two of the best pure funk songs the band ever did, while ""If You Don't Like the Effects, Don't Produce the Cause"", ""Biological Speculation"", ""Everybody Is Going to Make It This Time"", and ""Miss Lucifer's Love"" are great evidence of the band's strong pop bent even as their chosen subject matters could range from dark to disturbing to sci-fi. Tunes like ""I Call My Baby Pussycat"", ""Balance"", and ""Philmore"" even hark back to the more rock-oriented stuff of the first three records. However, it's hard to hear ""We Hurt Too"" (a maudlin ballad about the hidden tenderness of men) as anything but a joke, and the title track, similar to <i>Maggot Brain</i>'s title cut, is a bit heavy on the huffing and panting. I think of this record as Funkadelic's White Album, containing too much great stuff to dismiss, but by almost anyone's standards, containing more than it needs.</p>
<p>From here on out, Funkadelic would devote increasingly more time to maintaining and expanding their appeal. Albums like <i>Let's Take It to the Stage</i> and <i>Standing on the Verge of Getting It on</i> (also reissued, along with <i>Tales of Kidd Funkadelic</i>) were considerably less freaked-out than the early stuff, but alongside Parliament's concurrent music, helped turn Clinton's empire into one of the biggest acts in music. Still, I'll always love their first records the most. Call me rockist if you will, there's just something undeniably awesome about a funk band blasting guitar jams and telling me about neurotic bitches who want to take over the universe.</p></div>"|11739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11739-funkadelic-free-your-mind-maggot-brain-america-eats-its-young/|9.0|Dominique Leone

Bonus tracks like the tight instrumental ""As Good As I Can Feel"" and several single versions of album cuts make this album one of the most indispensable of all indispensable Funkadelic records.</p>
<p>Even as <i>Funkadelic</i> was an inspired statement, it wasn't exactly a coherent one, especially as most of the band had quit and come back again during the recording sessions. Their second record, 1971's <i>Free Your Mind</i> was the first (of only two) records done by the core unit from start to finish-- albeit, according to Clinton, one recorded in the span of a single day, while everyone was tripping. Compared to the debut, it's a lot more ""rock"" and a little less ""soul."" The opening track ""Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow"" was like a Sly Stone jam gone haywire, with fuzzed out guitar and bass, distorto-organ, and spoken, chanted or otherwise freaked vox appearing all over the mix. ""Friday Night, August 14th"", ""Funky Dollar Bill"", and ""I Wanna Know If It's Good to You"" were a bit tighter, and a lot harder. ""Funky Dollar Bill"" features another down-home-on-a-porch-and-an-amp-with-probably-some-pot-and-other-things guitar riff from Hazel and Clinton and company sounding completely fucked up and screaming out at you from the depths of the stereo on lines like ""you don't buy a life, you live a life, a father learns much too late-- HE WAS A-NEVER HOME!!"" ""Euology and Light"" is like a lysergic Lord's Prayer, replete with backwards choir. The bonus track ""Fish, Chips and Sweat"" is again reminiscent of Sly, but in his ""Dance to the Music"" guise, and is suitably celebratory, even as the mix distorts the tape.</p>
<p>And then they got serious: <i>Maggot Brain, released in the July of the same year, is the peak of the Funkadelic experience. The songs jam harder, the way out stuff is way fucking out there. Seriously, how many dimensions is Hazel traveling through on the instrumental title cut? His 10-minute guitar soliloquy is a spiraling model of the blues filtered through a psychedelic lens, and almost single-handedly places him in a realm with Hendrix, Jimmy Page, and Eric Clapton as one of the great classic rock guitarists. But it got better: ""Super Stupid"" was the tale of a dumbass junkie set to a tune Black Sabbath would have been proud of; ""Hit It And Quit It"" is a funk anthem where keyboardist Worrell gets his licks in and the beat turns around a dozen times before we hit the chorus; ""Can You Get to That"" is honest-to-whoever pop that showed Funkadelic could be serious from time to time, especially when it came to social commentary (and also featured Isaac Hayes' female background singers, giving it a classic soul sheen), and ""Wars of Armageddon"" (recently, wisely used by Optimo on the </i><i>Psyche Out</i> mix) is a knock-out-drag-down fight to the death between the world's best rhythm section and paranoid, psychedelic sound effects and crowd sounds. <i>Maggot Brain</i> was an explosive record, bursting at the seams with exactly the kind of larger than life sound a band called Funkadelic should have made.</p>
<p>Too bad most of the band left afterwards. Tiki Fulwood was fired due to drugs getting in the way of his reliability as a band member; Tawl Ross reportedly got into an ""acid eating contest, then snorting some raw speed, before completely flipping out,"" per Billy Nelson, and has not performed professionally since; Nelson himself quit over a money dispute with Clinton, leaving only Hazel and Worrell from the original Funkadelic lineup. Drummer Tyrone Lampkin replaced Fulwood, while guitarist Gary Shider (who'd already played with the band on parts of <i>Maggot Brain</i>) came aboard to fill out the sound. However, a lot of folks would look at former JBs like Phelps and William ""Bootsy"" Collins additions as the most significant. Certainly, Bootsy's mark on the whole Parliafunkadelicmint thang would eventually be almost as strong as Clinton's.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, 1972's <i>America Eats Its Young</i> is a disparate, schizophrenic record. Despite Clinton's efforts to produce a record that would have a better chance at crossover appeal than the first three Funkadelic records, like many double LPs, there's simply too much material, and too many conflicting directions to really make this seem anything other than a Frankenstein production. Of course, it has its classics: ""Loose Booty"" and ""A Joyful Process"" are the two of the best pure funk songs the band ever did, while ""If You Don't Like the Effects, Don't Produce the Cause"", ""Biological Speculation"", ""Everybody Is Going to Make It This Time"", and ""Miss Lucifer's Love"" are great evidence of the band's strong pop bent even as their chosen subject matters could range from dark to disturbing to sci-fi. Tunes like ""I Call My Baby Pussycat"", ""Balance"", and ""Philmore"" even hark back to the more rock-oriented stuff of the first three records. However, it's hard to hear ""We Hurt Too"" (a maudlin ballad about the hidden tenderness of men) as anything but a joke, and the title track, similar to <i>Maggot Brain</i>'s title cut, is a bit heavy on the huffing and panting. I think of this record as Funkadelic's White Album, containing too much great stuff to dismiss, but by almost anyone's standards, containing more than it needs.</p>
<p>From here on out, Funkadelic would devote increasingly more time to maintaining and expanding their appeal. Albums like <i>Let's Take It to the Stage</i> and <i>Standing on the Verge of Getting It on</i> (also reissued, along with <i>Tales of Kidd Funkadelic</i>) were considerably less freaked-out than the early stuff, but alongside Parliament's concurrent music, helped turn Clinton's empire into one of the biggest acts in music. Still, I'll always love their first records the most. Call me rockist if you will, there's just something undeniably awesome about a funk band blasting guitar jams and telling me about neurotic bitches who want to take over the universe.</p></div>"|11739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11739-funkadelic-free-your-mind-maggot-brain-america-eats-its-young/|9.4|Dominique Leone

In fact, screw everything, they're one of the greatest rock bands period, up there with any classic rock dinosaur you care to name. And though it's tempting to launch an essay on the racism of rock radio-- or rock journalism for that matter-- I'll stick to the band. Even as they're revered as legends and purveyors of the some of the best funk of the 70s, I've read relatively few accounts on their greatness as a pure rock band. But they had it all: great players, great singers, a great look, a great concept, actual hits, great albums, great drugs, freaky sex, disputes over money-- everything Led Zeppelin (or Spinal Tap) taught us was necessary to make the world's greatest rock music.</p>
<p>They started small, backing up ringleader George Clinton's Parliaments in the late 60s. When Clinton got into arguments with his label Revilot over money and rights, he decided to start recording his backup band instead, using the original Parliaments singers (Clinton, Ray Davis, Clarence ""Fuzzy"" Haskins-- and come on, dude's name is ""Fuzzy""-- Calvin Simon and Grady Thomas) as ""guests."" Guitarists Eddie Hazel and Tawl Ross, bassist Billy Nelson, drummer Tiki Fulwood, and eventually, master keyboardist Bernie Worrell were the band that would turn this fairly traditional soul group into the intense live act that wowed Detroit's Westbound Records head Armen Boladian. He signed them, and from the get-go, their music cut through genres and money bullshit like neither had ever existed. Never mind that half the band quit and came back again during recording sessions for their first record, Funkadelic was destined for greatness. Ace's reissues of the band's Westbound catalog is long overdue-- they sound a world better than the terribly mastered original CD pressings, and contain a wealth of bonus tracks, alternate mixes, and liner notes.</p>
<p><i>Funkadelic</i> from 1970 was a bomb dropped all over rock and soul. No matter Hendrix, no matter James Brown, no matter the MC5, nobody had ever heard anything like this. This music was slower than sludge, dirtier than the ""raw funk"" Herb ""Sparky"" Sparkman talks about in ""Music For My Mother"". It was a great big fucking mess, and a lot of people didn't know what to make of it. I remember reading a <i>Rolling Stone</i> review from the time that ended with ""who needs this shit?"" and a writer from the <i>Blues &amp; Soul</i> 'zine from a year later admitted, ""Funkadelic has never been one of my favorite R&amp;B; acts"". Still, the record sold (peaking at #16 on the Soul LPs chart), and planted the seed of a cult worship that would balloon in the latter half of the decade, making the P-Funk enterprise the most successful soul act on the planet.</p>
<p>""Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?"" started out with the sound of Clinton's wet mouth and the best ever opening line for an album: ""If you will suck my soul, I will lick your funky emotions."" When the beat hits with Hazel's guitar line, there can be no doubt that Funkadelic were without peer as far as this stuff was concerned. This stuff-- hell, tunes like ""Mommy"" and ""Good Old Music"" are slams to the gut as powerful as anything Zep ever did, and with beats to spare. ""Music For My Mother"" is like a Southern myth, detailing a loner's travels through ""Keep Runnin' Mississippi"", hearing music he thought long dead, yet getting trapped by its sticky black allure. ""What Is Soul?"" drops more classic lines (""soul is a hamhock in your cornflakes,"" ""Soul is chitlins foo young,"" ""soul is a joint rolled in toilet paper"") in seven minutes than most bands muster up in a career. Bonus tracks like the tight instrumental ""As Good As I Can Feel"" and several single versions of album cuts make this album one of the most indispensable of all indispensable Funkadelic records.</p>

Eight albums into their career, no one else comes close to their mastery of the genre, and when you think about it, the pieces for their run of remarkably consistent albums were in place from the beginning. The band has three accomplished songwriters whose voices blended as though nature intended it; what it lacked is a sense of adventurous experimentation, and as such, their discography is consistent almost to a fault, always good but never surprising or amazing.</p><p>
    
    It's possible that the band felt the need for a bit of a shake-up when it came time to record <i>Man-Made</i>, and they traveled to Chicago to record with John McEntire at his Soma Electronic Music Studio. The change of venue and the choice of McEntire are the kinds of moves that could precipitate real change in a band's sound, but as it turns out the record is full of the same intensely classicist power pop that's filled every Teenage Fanclub album. McEntire's influence is felt keenly on the edges of the music, though, in the textures of the guitars and bass and in the injection of a host of buzzing and burbling keyboards low in the mix. So while it's not a reinvention, the production does bring in a subtle infusion of the kind of energy and youthful vigor that was missing from recent outings like <em>Howdy! and </em><em>Songs from Northern Britain and makes <i>Man-Made</i> possibly the band's best outing since 1992's near-masterpiece </em><em>Bandwagonesque</em>.</p><p>
    
    The tracklist is split amongst four songs each from Norman Blake, Gerard Love, and Raymond McGinley. Blake's finest is opener ""It's All in My Mind"", which features the band's trademark gentle harmonies through a monster hook that counter-intuitively pulls back from the verse. Francis MacDonald's drums give the song an insistent beat while buzzing organ and e-bowed guitar quietly mingle in the background to lend the sound a little extra punch. Blake's ""Slow Fade"" is an invigorating nod to the swifter tempos and louder volumes of the band's early-90s salad days, whipping by in less than two minutes and including a spry if somewhat tuneless guitar solo.</p><p>
    
    Love's ""Time Stops"" benefits from well-placed, almost inaudible pizzicato strings in the pensive verses and floats by on a buoyant rhythm full of richly recorded drums and artful piano accents. McEntire's peculiar talent for recording basslines is on full view on McGinley's ""Nowhere"", which rides and especially nice one in its harmony-soaked verses. The vocals aren't the only thing harmonized on ""Feel"", a song that bursts out of the gate with doubled lead guitar and rides a loose groove the relies on a sparse piano part for a lot of its motion.</p><p>
<em>Man-Made ultimately sounds exactly like you'd expect a Teenage Fanclub album to sound, but with just enough extra to make it feel new again. It's unlikely at this point that any of their fans would want them to completely overhaul their approach anyhow, and indeed those fans are treated to the band's best collection of songs in more than a decade here. The uninitiated shouldn't skip over <i>Bandwagonesque</i></em> for this, but fans of both Teenage Fanclub and power pop in general will be very pleased with this.</p></div>"|7957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7957-man-made/|7.4|Joe Tangari

Last night I was playing ElekTro4's debut
    LP, <em>Keystroke One</em>, at the coffee shop where I work. I noticed a
    bespectacled grad student tapping his Pumas to the languid cadences of
    ElekTro4's fluid basslines, splashy drums, jazzy breaks, and hip-hop vocal
    samples and cuts. As he approached
    the counter for a refill, I could see the fated question massing upon
    his lips like a thunderhead. Then the storm broke as he gestured
    vaguely upward, toward the music: ""Is this DJ Shadow?""</p><p>
    
    A million pleasant but
    unexceptional instrumental hip-hop records has been DJ Shadow's uneasy
    legacy, and while <em>Keystroke One</em> leans into the more vivid end
    of the spectrum, forgoing some modern instrumental rap's fixation on
    boringly beautiful drones in favor of sharp, smart urban landscaping,
    it feels as if Y2K never happened. ElekTro4 is still partying like
    it's 1999, or maybe even 1995, and heads everywhere are suddenly
    remembering how much they dug Mr. Scruff back in the day. The problem
    with this sort of music (we used to call it trip-hop) in the here and
    now is that the two main things that made it sound hot in the '90s-- its newness and its technological advances-- are obsolete. Progress is
    a bitch.</p><p>
    
    Still, it's good audio wallpaper if not an attention magnet, and the
    execution is wicked sharp. The album is divided into two movements,
    the first of which is ""Portrait of the City"". This is where ElekTro4
    does that ""rendering the city as grimy crucible of humanity"" thang,
    incorporating city sounds like hissing train doors into stark horn
    breaks and clipped drum patterns, and on a recent trip to Brooklyn, it
    flowed just fine with the graffiti-splashed labyrinth of Williamsburg.
    Sixtoo's crisp production is a boon to this gusty urban melodrama, and
    on tracks like ""Chasin' Trains"", the top-heavy live drums steal the
    show from the sparse instrumental track, while ""Jaywalking"" relies
    more on vocal samples to shape its ominous pulse: Ghostface licking
    shots at 14-karat gold slum computer wizards &amp;c.; </p><p>
    
    Part two, ""The Suicide Suite"", backs off from hip-hop a bit for a more
    eclectic metropolitan survey, from the morphing dub plate ""Three Views
    of a Secret"", to the Latin syncopation of ""Searching for Answers"", to
    the indie-folksy trills and surges of ""The Explain Nation"" and ""A
    House with no Mirrors"". Overall, <em>Keystroke One</em> is another fine
    and evocatively grainy snapshot of the city in a photo album already
    threatening to sunder its bindings. </p></div>"|2932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2932-keystroke-one/|6.3|Brian Howe

Luckily, with <i>The DNA Will Have Its Say</i> you won't need to clear much room at all, as one can blast through these seven tracks in roughly the time it takes to reheat a medium-sized burrito. These may surely come to be cherished minutes for tradition-bound punk zealots-- and as useful talons as any for those of us with the occasional itch-- but for listeners intent on originality or (not to put too fine a point on it) traceable musical progress, Some Girls sound only too happy to spit upon your daydreams.</p><p>
    
    Arising from the always-fertile (and cross-bred) San Diego scene, Some Girls form a sort of hardcore supergroup, drawing membership from the ranks of several generally more innovative acts like the Locust, Give Up the Ghost, and Plot to Blow Up the Eiffel Tower. On <em>The DNA</em> the group has, if anything, amplified the ferocity present on the minute-long screeds of their 2003 LP <em>All My Friends Are Going Death</em>, and it's with a fundamentalist fervor that they pare their textbook retro-punk down to its rabid core.</p><p>
    
    Needless to say, the brief running time of these tracks virtually eliminates the possibility of any instrumental tangents or digressions, and each winds up carrying less than one percent body fat on its sinewy frame. Fortified by Justin Pearson's distorted bass and the frantic, buried-alive vocals of Wes Eisold, tracks like the quaintly titled opener ""I Need Drugs"" bear some resemblance to the punishing experimental noise of Lightning Bolt. But the hammering Dr. Know (ca.'82) power chords of guitarists Rob Moran and Chuck Rowell wrap these songs in decidedly familiar casings, and the group sounds altogether too content to blithely (albeit rowdily) animate all of hardcore's toastiest chestnuts.</p><p>
    
    The Yeah Yeah Yeah's Karen O makes a cameo on the headlong title track, although her Punk Everywoman shriek is so generic that unless you're sitting on FBI-caliber voice recognition software you're probably gonna have to take their word for it. Her presence here appears to be an oblique nod to a wider punk marketplace, one that's amplified by Some Girls' recent signing with Epitaph. And though there is some delight in the thought of these guys unchaining their vicious arch-nihilism onto the broader unsuspecting public, one can't help but wish that Some Girls exhibited more ambition to blow minds rather than simply chopping heads.</p></div>"|7824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7824-the-dna-will-have-its-say-ep/|5.9|Matthew Murphy

Like most youthful rap
    devotees, I'm a hyper-cognizant, Mix Hut-hoarding zombie, searching out the newest chipmunk loop or broken drum break, learning
    as I go, collecting knowledge, filing production credits on the regular.  But perspective is missing from most young-folk rap
    criticism today.  When forced to research, say, UTFO, Audio Two, or other bygone pillars, it can be difficult to stay focused.
    The productions can be creaky or the vocals poorly mixed.  There are titans (Marley Marl and Paul C. come to mind), but mostly
    everyone is feeling the sounds out, and adapting to new technology, budgets, etc.</p><p>
    
    We're in the midst of a pop progressives era, thanks to the likes of Just Blaze, Dr. Dre, Pharrell, and Timbaland-- mainstream men
    literally pushing harder than the next to find the most curious, throttling sounds to ground a pop record.  Right now, someone like
    Grandmaster Flash, while noble and significant, sounds staid.  Public Enemy remain one of the few acts that can stand up to the
    sonic innovations of those dudes-- and in most cases still eclipse them.  When I first started devouring the P.E. canon, it was
    emotional to discover something from their day that sounded like 2077 A.D.  The shit still can't be touched.</p><p>
    
    Still, there's really no sense in compiling a Public Enemy greatest hits.  They are a classic ""albums"" band, full of songs that
    crash into each other with force, amelodic glory spilling into James Brown's chopped-up yelps and shouts.  It was done once before
    with 2001's pitiful <em>Universal Masters Collection, a poorly constructed quickie cash-in.  If you're serious about 20th century
    music, P.E.'s first four albums are essential.  <i>Yo! Bumrush the Show</i>, <i>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back</i>,
    <i>Fear of a Black Planet</i>, and (to a lesser extent) <i>Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black</i></em> are all sweltering documents
    of a furiously exciting period.  Culling the bulk of its content from those albums, <i>Power to the People and the Beats</i> doesn't
    offer much unity; rather, it skips chronologically from one chest-thumper to the next.  In particular, <i>Nation of Millions</i> and
    <i>Black Planet</i>, the band's most revered works, get mined for 10 of the collection's 18 tracks.</p><p>
    
    Things jump off with their all-business 1982 fight song ""Public Enemy No. 1"", a track that spurred then-short-bearded buddy Rick
    Rubin to encourage Chuck D and the newly formed P.E. to pursue a career and sign to Def Jam.  Chuck, then 22 and working at Adelphi
    University's WBAU, initially thought he was too old for the rap game and resisted Rubin's nudging-- luckily, Rubin eventually broke
    him down.  Cobbled-together compilations that utilize the chronological movement usually make sense as a means of understanding an
    artist's progression, but as a unit, P.E. were so scintillating and fully realized on ""Public Enemy No.1""-- all buzzing squirt
    synths and defiant Carlton Ridenhour braggadocio-- that to end on 1998's mildly received soundtrack cut ""He Got Game"" is deflating
    and marks a less-than-subtle regression.</p><p>
    
    But fear not, from ""Rebel Without a Pause"" to ""Fight the Power"" (still the angriest pop song of all time) to the underrated MLK Day
    screed ""By the Time I Get to Arizona"", <i>Power to the People and the Beats</i> doesn't miss a hit.  The gang's all here, too:
    Flavor Flav, rap's first necessary hypeman; the Bomb Squad, whose avant-garde sample-and-smash productions are still ahead of their
    time; DJ par excellence Terminator X; and Professor Griff's misguided proselytizing.  The construction of the group-- not just
    musically, but in presentation-- was so dynamic and original that it's impossible replicate in print.  Just watch the ""Fight the
    Power"" video.  It's still easy to visualize foot soldiers, the S1Ws, marching along to ""Welcome to the Terrordome""'s walloping snare.</p><p>
    
    Of all the commercially viable and artfully innovative groups of the 1980s, not one is fucking with Public Enemy.  Chuck brought a
    political conscience that spoke mostly out of anger and disenfranchisement (""I like Nike, but wait a minute.../ The neighborhoods
    are poor, so put some money in it""), and his baritone could flow for days.  Flav, a media clown nowadays, is well-represented with
    ""911 Is a Joke"" and ""Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man"".  During this period, Flav was funny but never obsequious, so his spiral into
    VH1dom is saddening.  Terminator X remains a singularly important DJ, unafraid to frighten an audience with thrash and bombast, but
    also fully aware of how tunefulness lay at the heart of any crowd-mover.  The Shocklee Brothers (along with a young Easy Mo Bee,
    Gary G-Wiz, Eric Sadler, Sleek, and Panic) delivered a new style of music production, chopping loops and samples so harshly and
    precisely that each track bangs like an elephant stampede.  Only the late-era ""Give It Up"" has any sort of sing-along tunefulness
    here.</p><p>
    
    There are a few minor omissions and fumbles. We're without the ill-advised Anthrax misstep ""Bring the Noize"", rap-rock before we all
    hated rap-rock.  Early jams like ""My Uzi Weighs a Ton"" and ""Louder Than a Bomb"" are omitted to make room for the more obscure ""Hazy
    Shade of Criminal"".  That track is the lone <i>Greatest Misses</i> representative here, but though intriguing for its martial anarchy,
    it's hardly vital to their oeuvre.  Otherwise, <i>Power to the People</i>'s tracklist is essentially bulletproof, with latter-day
    releases like 2003's <i>Revolverlution</i> wisely excluded.  In fact, my only personal gripe is the absence of Pete Rock's remix
    for ""Shut 'em Down"", arguably the finest argument for hip-hop remixes ever.</p><p>
    
    There's been something of a Public Enemy revival of late.  In addition to this collection, a live DVD, <i>It Takes a Nation: The
    First London Invasion Tour 1987</i>, was released in May.  Another as-yet-untitled LP is due this fall.  (<i>Rebirth of a Nation</i>
    has been delayed until sometime next year.)  Chuck D likewise remains a vocal presence in politics and technology (he was one of the
    original advocates of filesharing), if no longer a rapper's delight.  It's nice that there's a minor resurgence, as it's likely to
    turn a new generation onto such pioneers, but it makes me yearn for the real thing.  Which, of course, I didn't even grow up with.</p></div>"|6502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6502-power-to-the-people-and-the-beats/|9.4|Sean Fennessey

Since its mid-century installation in the repertoire of experimental music, drone has been coded with naked aspirations: people looking to the holy East; people looking to the archaic; people looking into deep space, into the pure machine, into the stranger mind. Drone has always been enamored of the faraway. The sacred, as always, must be imported from there.</p><p>
    Its devotees are few but fervent. But the faith has always seemed strangely incommunicable: It doesn't seem to get many converts, just initiates and infidels and no commerce between them. Missionary work is a slog. Those who have made stabs at evangelization know the response is usually incredulity rather than hostility. Minimalist classics have been returned to me with a blankness bordering on incomprehension, as if I'd handed out videotapes of television snow and demanded an assessment of character arcs. So it is rare to find yourself born again to a random airing of <i>You Are My Everlovin'/Celestial Power</i>. If you own it, chances are you've already been saved by it.</p><p>
    But the seekers of the world owe a just debt of gratitude to Antony Milton's PseudoArcana label for offering up a fine little hymnal for our headphone communions. True to form, the call to prayer comes by way of the Perseus Cluster, a gathering of galaxies some 250 million light years away, which astronomers believe has been humming a steady B-flat drone since the universe was a toddler. Marshalling the extensive and shadowy networks developed between NASA and the New Zealand free noise scene in the wane of the Carter administration, a tribute album to the bass cluster has emerged. And though of dubious scientific merit and obscure political import, <em>The Tone of the Universe (=The Tone of the Earth)</em> is a monumental collection of music.</p><p>
    Appropriate to a work of intergalactic negotiation, the compilation draws from the farthest flung reaches of terrestrial drone: New Zealand, the UK, Italy, Argentina, Finland, and the U.S. have sent delegates, like some kind of very slow and poorly-lit Olympiad. This geographical variety translates brilliantly into sound, every contributor seemingly speaking in his or her own musical language, and none falling back on the ponderous immobility that can render minimalism so oppressive.  On ""Map of Dusk"", the Blithe Sons, charter members of San Francisco's illustrious Jewelled Antler collective, dispense with their California pastorals and backyard <em>musique concrete</em> for something less humane: a pestilential little cloud of harmonium evaporations and feedback expanding and compressing like an iron lung. Peter Wright's idyllic ""Haboob""-- one of the collection's high points-- is barely drone in any sense of the word, a lyrical 12-string guitar prayer plucked over delicately tremulous strings.</p><p>
    The heavy trappings of bow-and-scrape drone are eschewed in Finnish experimentalist Keijo's ""Stellar Wind"", a weirdly rollicking folk blues ramble. Even shot through with warbling treated winds and chirpy electronica, the track seems more suited to the high plains than the higher nebulae. And for those somehow not satiated by last year's sprawling 3xCD set, <em>Pontiac Lady</em>, the mighty Vibracathedral Orchestra add a short jagged slab of noise-rock much more uproarious than their usual skittering ceremony. ""3 Bb Moods"" lurches into Acid Mothers territory with shrapnel guitar lines exploding over psilocybin raga. Vibracathedral's explosive excursion into electric heavyland resolves into Hands of Satisfaction's long ""Version 1"", 11 minutes of noise pointillism, where dead guitar bursts punctuate soft clatter and glitch. Expansive and not entirely successful, ""Version 1"" flags early and doesn't vary its formula.</p><p>
    The second disc of the collection is dominated by contributions from the Celebrate Psi Phenomenon crowd. C/Psi/P label head Campbell Kneale's own Birchville Cat Motel serves up a behemoth of bright and majestic skree ""I Am But Dust"". Few practitioners of the art have the natural virtuosity of Kneale, who, like surgeons and serial killers, succeeds by sheer dint of patience. Kneale trusts his own ideas and is unafraid to let them unfold over great durations; and the eight-minutes of washed-out organs and screaming guitars in ""I am But Dust"" proceed with the pomp and circumstance of a coronation procession. Seht's unnerving and appropriately titled ""Antarctica Download (Edit)"" turns warm analog cold, with bright keyboards dripped as icicles ominously from all directions. The piercing scrapes and gongs of 1/3 Octave Band's ""Dominion"", on the other hand, are harsh and unpleasant, albeit mercifully brief. </p><p>
<i>The Tone of the Universe</i> concludes with the grand galactica of the brothers Opalio, the Italian sonic cosmonauts better known as My Cat is an Alien. Amidst bells and phasers and dubious space opera sound effects, an accented continental repeatedly urges us to ""hear the voice of the cosmos."" But to his credit he does not say precisely where one must listen for it. </p><p>
    Even with the odd failed experiment or heavy-handed concoction, <em>The Tone of the Universe</em> on the whole succeeds brilliantly, not by paying homage to heavenly bodies resonating 57 octaves below the limits of human hearing, but by bringing the cold and scattered outskirts of the musical galaxy a little closer to hand. There is great solace in hearing that there are still strange goings-on abroad on this planet. And that, brothers and sisters, is truly the good news.</p></div>"|2094.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2094-the-tone-of-the-universe-the-tone-of-the-earth/|7.8|Brent S. Sirota

    (born 
    after 1984) a taste of the original version of 2005's best single 
    (Crazy 
    Frog's ""Axel F""). The verdict: too slow and would be improved by 
    cartoon 
    amphibian ragga chat. So it goes with the rest of <em>12""/80s/2</em>. Critic and 
    personal hero John Leland has said the 12"" single was <i>the artform 
    (not 
    just the format) of the 1980s, and he's not wrong. On other days I 
    might 
    just make it ""single,"" since 12"" leaves out such totemic 80s artifacts 
    as 
    the first Minor Threat record and Wayne Smith's ""Under Mi Sleng Teng"". 
    But 
    singles are almost always the artform of any decade, and limiting it to 
    12""'s 
    for a certain decade makes it nicely polemical.</i></p><p>
    
    It was probably just a coincidence of commerce, but when CBS (then the 
    biggest major) axed the vinyl single at the dawn of the 90s, it was the 
    end 
    of an era. 12"" singles survive, obviously, but niche marketed to their 
    individual dance scenes. Mixtape tracks, mp3s, whatever...all have 
    features 
    intrinsic to the format that quietly nudge the music into its given 
    shape. 
    When the 12"" single disappeared, so did extended disco motion and mod 
    FX 
    abuse from the pop single still recognizable as a pop single. As the 
    90s 
    dawned, with house first flexing its iron grip, it became much easier 
    to 
    bung an acapella on top of 4/4 boom-tick to make sure it got Club Play. 
    This 
    is probably the last time ""dance music"" meant multiplicity without 
    being 
    consciously eclectic.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, we run into the same problem as the last time I was 
    reviewing 
    one of these things. Scribble out the title above and replace it with 
    ""If 
    You Were White and British In the 80s, It Might Have Sounded Like 
    This."" I 
    count the number of non-palefaces at around three. And, of course, 
    since 
    this is a British collection, no Americans, no rappers, ragga toasters, 
    go-go troupes, Latin freestylers, funk mobs, or unwashed psychobillies. 
    I am 
    not saying it's gotta have the 12"" mixes of ""I Feel For You"" or 
    ""Raspberry 
    Beret"" or the ""Rock Box"" single to be ""complete."" But, from the 
    tracklisting 
    to the octagonal syndrums on the cover, there's an icky kitsch vibe 
    that 
    hampers my enjoyment. Which is a shame because, musically, at least on 
    the 
    first disc, it's pretty unimpeachable, way better than the first.</p><p>
    
    Can you fuck with the Bowie-with-his-nuts-in-a-vice dramedy of the 
    Associates' ""Party Fears Two""? The Tarzan boy roiling dementia of 
    Pigbag's 
    ""Papa's Got a Brand New Pigbag""? The ""Annihilation mix"" of Frankie Goes 
    To 
    Hollywood's ""Two Tribes"", which makes cold war paranoia and mutually 
    assured 
    destruction seem both terrifying and thrilling, as well as including 
    the 
    wackest Reagan impersonation this side of Rich Little?  The 
    proto-freestyle 
    of the ""Miami mix"" of ABC's ""When Smokey Sings""? The Patrick Nagel 
    glitch of 
    Duran Duran's ""The Reflex""? The best-African-disco-rip-off-ever of Tom 
    Tom 
    Club's ""Genius of Love""? The Cole Porter-meets-conga line acid wit of 
    Kid 
    Creole's ""Annie I'm Not Your Daddy""? (Who, along with Sly &amp; Robbie, are 
    among the few non-anglos here. Oh, and 1/3 of the Thompson Twins.) The 
    amyl 
    nitrate and camp moustache Kraftwerk pastiche of Yello's ""The Race""? 
    No, of 
    course you cannot.</p><p>
    
    As Tom Ewing noted on NYLPM, compilations like this one cast a weird 
    sort of 
    spell in a record store. You hold it in your hands, admire the 
    packaging, 
    notice all the great songs you love and the ones you don't know that 
    <i>could 
    be great, breath in the total consumer object pheromone. And then 
    suddenly 
    all the bad (or mediocre) songs disappear. Until you get it home and 
    play 
    the damn thing. (Generally I have no problem with Culture Club, but 
    ""I'll 
    Tumble 4 Ya"" is so sickly coy and mimsy that you start to think Albini 
    has a 
    point.) These type of comps are also becoming more untenable as 
    (remember 
    kids) legal downloading outpaces traditional bricks and mortar outlets. 
    That 
    sure is nice packaging though.</i></p></div>"|11712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11712-1280s2/|7.1|Jess Harvell

Out of his Ipecac label's 69
    spine numbers, at least 25 are Melvins releases or feature a member of the band.  If we create sanctuaries for bald eagles, why
    can't we make one for the goofball kings of sludge?  Through Ipecac, the Melvins have been safe to release a book, a noise album,
    a handful of seven-inches, a re-release of their first album, and even a trilogy.  So what kind of gimmick release could top all
    this?  Try a collection of demos from the band's original lineup.</p><p>
    
    When listening to <em>Mangled Demos From 1983</em>, it's apparent that hardcore ruled U.S. indie rock in the 80s.  Your parents probably
    met at a Bad Brains show, and you were probably conceived to a Minor Threat tape later that night (thus making you the straight-edge
    antichrist). It's no wonder, then, that before they played sludge or Dale Crover joined on drums, these drunk-ass punks from an isolated
    town in Washington state started a hardcore band.  ""Forgotten Principles"", ""If You Get Bored"", and ""Set Me Straight"" have all the
    generic traits of TSOL, DRI, MDC (and any other acronym you can think of), with their surly, semi-guttural vocals, high-pitched
    buzzing guitars, and drums that suddenly switch to double-time in an attempt to mask that the same riff is played over and over.
    Elsewhere, ""Matt Alec"" predicts the meandering grunge that the Melvins were known for, and which millions of kids in overpriced Doc
    Martens would discover after getting into Nirvana. (""It just ain't a Melvins review without a Cobain reference,"" my hardcore mom used
    to say.)</p><p>
    
    The highlight of this amateur collection is the Elks Lodge Christmas radio broadcast of ""If You Get Bored"".  It starts with banter
    between God-fearing, blue-collar, WASP announcers and a laughably ""punk as fuck"" Matt Lukin (who would leave after these recordings
    to eventually form Mudhoney).  After the announcers treat the band like cute little kids at a church talent show, Buzz Osbourne and
    crew proceed to horrify the small town audience with a barrage of blistering noise.</p><p>
    
    Thank God Buzz and company learned to love Sabbath and gave up on being the next hardcore band to move to L.A. and get prominently
    featured on cheaply photocopied fliers. The Melvins have made some great albums over time (<i>Lysol</i>, <i>Bullhead</i>, and <i>Stoner
    Witch</i> among them) yet <em>Mangled Demos</em> probably should have lingered in obscurity, cannibalized on various bootlegs for the
    inquisitive fan to stumble upon on the internet.  Instead, thanks to Ipecac, the world has yet another Melvins record floating around.</p></div>"|5222.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5222-mangled-demos-from-1983/|5.3|Austin Gaines

After releasing two amazingly deprived, hedonistic, sometimes downright unsettling punk-rock albums in the late 90's (1997's <em>Ass Cobra</em> and 1999's <em>Apocalypse Dudes</em>), the band broke up amidst self-perpetuated rumors of rock'n'roll excess, drug abuse, and mental breakdowns. In the years that followed, however, the band's popularity grew, especially stateside, where they were practically unknown during their original tenure. In 2002, they returned with <em>Scandinavian Leather</em>, an album that placed more emphasis on mid-tempo rock than any of their work so far, and although it was a definite step down from previous work, it still delivered plenty of the band's characteristic sub-toilet humor while showcasing their impressive musicianship.</p><p>
    
    But really, it didn't come as much of a surprise that <em>Scandinavian Leather</em> didn't deliver the same quality as the pre-breakup albums. How often does a band return from a split and maintain their momentum? And unfortunately, Turbonegro have continued their downward descent with their sixth studio album, <em>Party Animals</em>, a steaming pile of generic cock-rock with hardly a trace of the ""death punk"" the band began bashing out over a decade ago.</p><p>
    
    For a band that has used surprise and shock value to their credit so often in the past, to hear Turbonegro slink their way into such a predictable pattern is a disappointment to say the least. Just like the two albums before it, <em>Party Animals</em> begins with a brief intro before launching into the first true song. But unlike the other two intros, this one is just a mess, combining obnoxious guitar soloing, an unintelligible robotic voice over, and a ""We Will Rock You"" style drum beat. It's more irritating than anything, and it does nothing to ramp up the listener for the rest of the album. </p><p>
    
    The first real song, ""All My Friends Are Dead"", is one of the better tracks, but even so it wouldn't quite hold up in the context of the band's stronger work. It's on par with some of the more upbeat work from <em>Scandinavian Leather</em> as your basic three-chord punk, but it's also the first sign of how crisp and clean of the album sounds, thanks in part to Redd Kross bassist/producer Steve McDonald. And from there on, it's a miss-or-horribly-miss affair until the end. ""Blow Me Like the Wind"" is way too catchy for its own good, and singer Hank Von Helvete's lyrics are so insipid you'll crave the depth of such past hits as ""Wipe It 'Til It Bleeds."" A sample: ""If I gave you a dime, would you blow my paradigm? If I gave you my candle, would it be too hot to handle? If I ran for election, would you support my erection?"" </p><p>
    
    Don't get me wrong; I expect sexual puns from Turbonegro, but I also expect something at least mildly clever and humorous. But <em>Party Animals</em> is neither of those. About the most clever thing here is the track ""If You See Kaye"" (saying it out loud might help to spell out the joke for you, a pun already used by the Poster Children). Elsewhere the band apes everyone from the Dead Boys (""Wasted Again"") to Van Halen (""Stay Free""), and continues with the intentionally just-barely-offensive lyrics. </p><p>
    
    The album's worst offender is ""City of Satan"", which brings back the generic beat you'd hoped to forget from the intro, and features an unlistenable sing-along refrain. But then, about four minutes in, something odd happens. The rhythm changes, the vocals almost completely drop away, and horns and strings join in to punch up the melody. It's like they wanted Bob Ezrin to produce, but could only afford him for those two minutes. This then is the most frustrating aspect of <em>Party Animals</em>: These guys are incredibly talented musicians and arrangers. If they pulled out the strong parts of each song and scrapped the garbage, we'd have an EP that would easily stand alongside anything the band has done in the past.</p><p>
    
    Of course, that's not how it turned out. <em>Party Animals</em> is a failure. It's the sound of a band trying to keep their growing fan base on the upswing, while completely running out of new ideas; the sound of a band collapsing under the weight of their own gimmick. </p></div>"|8187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8187-party-animals/|2.8|Cory D.

Because of this     scarcity, when such an unexpected (and immediate) discovery does take     place, it's like being struck by indescribable melodic lightning:     Unlike discs that warrant facile disses or mediocre passing grades,     the countless reasons for its boundless successes remain ineffable and     shadowy despite repeat late-night close-listening sessions.</p>
<p>Simply put, Dungen exhibit all the signs of legitimate, hard-won     staying power. <i>Ta Det Lugnt is an exceedingly triumphant psych-pop     oddity that evokes Keith Moon's drum fills on </i><i>The Who Sell Out, the     wraiths of unsung bedroom psyche celebrants, and the acoustic sustain     and harmonizing of The Byrds' </i><i>Younger Than Yesterday</i>. <i>Ta Det Lugnt     feels less like a new release than some ancient tome, a fully formed     masterpiece dropped unexpectedly on corduroy laps from some blue-brown     sky. It's so aesthetically tight that even carbon dating insists that     it could not be post-millennial.</i></p>
<p>To be sure, there's a major difference between retro and somehow     embodying your parents' vintage zeitgeist: It's damn-near impossible     to believe that the humming tubes, crackling drums, smoky backdrop,     and complexly interwoven melodies on Ta Det Lugnt were birthed in a     quick-fix iPod age. But perhaps even more impressive is that, despite     the music's headiness and intricacy, its anachronistic results feel     unusually effortless, earnest, and unpretentious: Dungen seem driven     to this sound not for bloodless cred points, but out of a very sincere     devotion to the music from a bygone era.</p>
<p>Accomplished beyond his years, 26-year-old Swedish     multi-instrumentalist Gustav Ejstes is the pin-up mastermind behind     Dungen's vibrant polish. For the full duration of his third album's 13     bracing tracks, he perfectly inhabits-- and then expands upon-- his     homeland's late-60s/early-70s acid-rock scene. Ta Det Lugnt     particularly taps into the expansiveness of his Swedish psych     predecessors, Parson Sound, while maintaining a murky rocker edge:     Imagine that band colliding with The Kinks, or Amon Dl II with Olivia     Tremor Control, or Comets on Fire with The Zombies on their way to     Terrastock.</p>
<p>Interested in pushing pop glitter to its limits, Ejstes doesn't go as     far afield into psych-pop cliches like chirping birds and hippie     atmospherics as his elder brethren, but his equally vintage garage     sound allows a definite space for ethereality in the form of funereal     dew-drop strings, free jazz breakdowns, brief whiffs of AM radio     tuning, flute minuets, lushly cascading pianos, prog time changes,     florid medieval chimes, sky-melting freak outs, church organs,     fuzz-guitar jousts, doubled mountain-top whistles, roaring six-string     solos, and autumnal instrumental interludes. It's obvious his songs     are painstakingly arranged with a sense of depth, gradations, and     tonal three-dimensionality redolent of something as off the charts as     <i>Pet Sounds</i>.</p>
<p>I said all of the above and more last year, and it still holds true. Hindsight and new layers of hype included, <i>Ta     Det Lugnt remains a consistently amazing album. Since     my initial tongue-wagging Dungen's deservedly gone     from limited distribution and whispered word-of-mouth to </i><i>NME</i> hyperbole     and glowing write-ups in just about every community newspaper from the     <i>Philadelphia Daily News to </i><i>San Francisco Weekly (and beyond). There's     also been a rush to offer more sounds: A few months back came the     generally misunderstood compilation </i><i>1999-2001, wherein Ejstes     re-stitched early material into three lengthy soundscapes instead of     presenting them in their original form, and now, of course, comes the     U.S. re-release of the fire starter, </i><i>Ta Det Lugnt.</i></p>
<p>Repackaged by NYC's Kemado Records (home of Elefant, Diamond Nights, and goofy Brooklyn loft crashers     Cheeseburger), the album is as it was, but comes with an extra CD that     includes five previously unreleased tracks, which will also eventually     appear on Subliminal Sounds as a vinyl 12"". As might be expected, the     add-ons aren't as amazingly ordered or cohesive as the album proper,     but they do pleasingly expand the Dungen oeuvre.</p>
<p>Of the five tracks, four are instrumental. Only the opener, ""Tyst     Minut"", an outtake from the <i>Ta Det Lugnt</i> sessions, offers a new     taste of Ejstes' Swedish. The sleepy mid-tempo four minutes     open with crystalline strums, Nyquil vocalizations and chordal rings, then turn back into     a semi-smoking singsong. The chorus picks things up a bit with accompanying     guitar noodle and the bridge is a molasses solo that shifts into     florid piano cascades. It's followed by ""Jamna Plagor"", an     instrumental from 2003, notable for its interesting percussion sound     (tinny, echoed hand drums?) and mid-song dissolve into a brief metagalactic     interstices. Though enjoyable, it's nothing special.</p>
<p>More interesting are the three new recordings, ""Sjutton"",     ""Christopher"", and ""Badsang"" (""Bathing Song""), which give a taste of     Dungen yet-to-come. There's a free, loose feel honing in at points on     improvisational jazz and/or Can's galvanic sweep. ""Sjutton""'s     pronounced flute and cocky shaker keep time while the rest of the band     swaggers and staggers alongside cymbal crashes. The     blistering ""Christopher"" is a two-minute showcase of sweaty, Hendrixian psychedelia, as well as a nod to dark-minded LSD     trips everywhere. Closer ""Badsang"" sounds very much like     something you and yours would plug into while frolicking with water     nymphs in a sunny, dusky forest, though the vibrational Dr. Who     halfway point does grow a little lizard-king creepy.</p>
<p>As increasingly <i>de rigueur reviews cloud the water, it should be     interesting to see if Dungen can one day top </i><i>Ta Det Lugnt</i>, or if album     three proves a magically brilliant and unrepeatable accomplishment.     Regardless, they seem to be taking the success in stride, showcasing     more than a few positive-growth indicators including their emergence     as a solid live band (and not simply an elaborate studio project), the     decision to continue recording in Swedish, Ejstes' folk fiddle     mastery, and the well-grounded, astute experimentation suggested in     their newer work.</p></div>"|2575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2575-ta-det-lugnt-expanded/|9.3|Brandon Stosuy

Apparently the long elliptical orbit of music
    fashion has brought the squelchy buzz of the 303 back into view. It's
    just the tip of the iceberg, I'm sure, but in the last couple months
    I've sifted through all the AFX <em>Analord</em> releases, digested Uwe
    Schmidt's faux comp <em>Acid Evolution 1988-2003</em>, Soul Jazz's Chicago acid house disc, and this, Luke Vibert's
    collection of three acid-themed 12-inches put out by Planet Mu. Of the newly recorded material, this is
    the best of that lot.</p><p>
    I've never been a huge Vibert fan in any of his various guises (Plug,
    Wagon Christ, etc). His music has always seemed workmanlike and
    consistently listenable, but I was never able to tease out much in the
    way of personality. <em>Lover's Acid</em>, though, reveals Vibert as a producer
    with
    a keen sense of musical humor and an abiding interest in funkiness.
    ""Funky Acid Stuff"" from the ""'95-'99"" 12-inch is an excellent opener-- a
    James Brown bassline sample combined with big, splashy drums, which  drives an
    wonderfully obnoxious acid line through the center of the thing. The
    breaks on ""Acid2000"" also draw rhythmic inspiration from hip-hop, with
    a
    simple piano progression serves as a delicious contrast to the busy
    electronics. On these tracks it's enjoyable to hear Vibert's
    instrumental hip-hop Ninja Tune aesthetic with the lead 303 way out
    front.</p><p>
    The pure machine tracks are slightly less interesting but still good.
    ""Lover's Acid"" is a spacey mid-tempo number that's basically just dinky
    analog drum programming behind a lead squiggle, and the late-90s track
    ""Analord"" has a vintage palette quite similar to the recent AFX project
    of the same name. Vibert's take on the sound is simpler and more pop,
    with regular hints of sing-songy new wave in the melody. ""Come on
    Chaos"", a rougher electro track out of a sci-fi film chase scene, loses
    some energy with clichd ""C-c-c-c come on!"" vocal samples. Two tracks,
    the Mo' Wax-style trip-hop ""Prick Tat"" and the faux-exotica ""Gwithian"",
    forego the acid theme entirely, and both come across as the same sort
    of
    solid but unexceptional material Vibert has been making for a long
    time.</p><p>
    All told <em>Lover's Acid</em> is a lot of fun despite a few dull patches. These
    dozen tracks recorded over the course of eight or nine years show little reference
    for any particular genre, and seem to grab from whatever's handy and
    might provide a laugh. Where the AFX <em>Analord records followed the
    gurgle
    of the 303 straight into the guts of the machine to mediate on the
    physics of vintage electronics, Vibert uses the essential
    ridiculousness
    of the sound as a foundation on which to build effective party music.</em></p></div>"|8464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8464-lovers-acid/|7.5|Mark Richardson

    debut, but a reprint of their first EP with the addition of two remixes,
    an acoustic version of ""Falcons and Vulcans"", and a video.
    Hearing it now, it obviously sounds like a first step, but it
    reaffirms what many heard on <em>We Should Have Never Lived Like We Were
    Skyscrapers</em>: a poppy spin on a familiar sound, a singer still finding
    his voice, and a band with a great deal of potential.</p><p>
    
    The original version of ""Collide the Tide"" opens the EP (it was
    re-recorded for their full-length), and while the hand-muted guitar scratches
    and funk rhythms wedged between jangly choruses weren't exactly
    revelatory on either version, the chords pull a surprisingly tender switch
    beneath Jeremy Bolan's hushed vocals, and this version's rhythm
    flows a little more naturally, like post-rock with a steady pop pulse
    underneath instead of just playing bait-and-switch with genre.</p><p>
    
    The EP doesn't have half of the varied instrumentation of their
    following full-length, so tracks like ""Fuck You, Elton John"" and ""For All the
    Tanning Salons in Texas"" fall a bit flat. ""Elton John"" could have been
    more successful if its climax didn't depend on Bolan's ability
    to belt out his vocals, and he strains when outside of the hoarse,
    near-whispered style he relies on. The band are still toying with ideas
    here, and ""Tanning Salons"" gets by on galloping guitar lines that would
    suffice for an instrumental, but sound gray and flat in the context of a
    pop song.</p><p>
    
    However, there is some variation here. ""The Soccer Mom Gets Her
    Fix"" winds 80s keyboards around its unpredictable rhythms. ""I'm  Not Asking
    for a Tennis Bracelet"" uses a theremin as its anchoring melody (played
    by fellow Chicagoan Devin Davis), and grows progressively calmer
    over the many permutations of winding guitar notes and layered vocals.
    ""Pillage the Village"" is an average performance that nonetheless builds
    nicely, and the minimal one-note keyboards hint at the Cure influence
    that was expanded upon on <em>We Should Have Never Lived...</em></p><p>
    
    The remix of ""We Should Have Never Lived Like We Were Skyscrapers"" is
    reverent to the original, borrowing all the right segments and
    stretching the wistful emotions at the heart of the track. Unfortunately, the
    new beat is average and tepid IDM fare-- so close, and yet so far. The
    remix of ""The Architect has a Gun"" by Ronald Simmons/Gene McDonald
    (aka Tim Kinsella) leans too far in the other direction, taking the
    originals's elated vocal performance and twisting it into low, creepy choirs
    and buzzing hives, but it's neither a very daring nor memorable sound.
    ""Falconz and Vulcanz"", however, translates surprisingly well in an
    acoustic setting, revealing richly melodic guitar work.</p><p>
    
    Despite their ponderous song titles and instrumentation, Chin Up Chin
    Up were already reaching towards concise pop songs on their debut EP.
    The best songs here straddle the line between melodic indie and
    post-rock, and if the band could use the merits of both, balance technical
    ability and instrumental tension-and-release with sharp hooks, they'd have
    boundless potential for great future records. Listening to the varied arrangements and melodies of <i>We Should Have Never Lived... after
    hearing this EP makes it sound all the more possible. I can't wait to
    hear what they do next.</i></p></div>"|1793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1793-chin-up-chin-up-ep/|7.0|Jason Crock

Unless you care about nuclear proliferation, the
    Geneva Conventions or wholesale death/destruction in countries that
    aren't the U.S. of freakin' A., that was a pretty good year. The Red
    Sox shattered the Curse. Animal Collective (disc 1, track 20)
    deconstructed <em>SMiLE!</em>-style harmonies and resurrected them in a
    misty, pantheistic glen. The Go! Team (disc 2, track 4) rocketed over
    cynics like so many triumphant TV-theme samples and block-party beats.
    Speaking of, Bloc Party (disc 2, track 22) here offer some of their undeniably
    accessible post-what-have-you.</p><p>
    
    At London's Rough Trade Shops, 2004 was apparently a year of
    sleep-encrusted avant-folk (disc 1) and steroidal dance-punk (disc 2,
    with happy exceptions). Omissions are legion, <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/top/2004""><u>well-documented</u></a>, and fun to
    point out: Mike Skinner's thousand quid? Lost again! Arcade Fire's
    <em>Funeral</em>? They've never been born! The Concretes? Their name's
    actually on the album cover, but I guess they don't watch Target ads
    overseas.</p><p>
    
    Over two discs and 49 songs, the Rough Trade crew requite themselves
    better as historical curators than as present-day tastemakers. Their
    greatest discoveries are actually rediscoveries, like 1966's ""Please
    Stay"", an achingly desperate, far-superior Drifters cover by
    overlooked Merseybeat sextet the Cryin' Shames (not to be confused
    with <em>Nuggets</em> vets the Cryan' Shames). Candi Staton turns in
    tear-stained turn-of-the-70s Southern soul classic ""You Don't Love Me
    No More"", reissued last year as part of a welcome Astralwerks
    anthology. The Cramps' backing on <em>Queen of Rockabilly</em> Wanda
    Jackson's recent re-recording of her 1962 ""Funnel of Love"" whisks the
    song into the psychedelic tumbleweed of First Edition-era Kenny
    Rogers.</p><p>
    
    As for new stuff: The quiet disc (disc 1, in case you weren't paying
    attention) starts with an ethereal sigh, ""Believer"", courtesy of
    Norwegian group Susanna and the Magic Orchestra, which includes Jaga
    Jazzist alums, and somnambulates from there, only occasionally bumping
    into wakeful brilliance. For every ""Let's Get Lost"", a typically
    depressive Elliott Smith song in ""Mother Nature's Son"" bake, there's a
    mood-killer by CocoRosie or Pony Up!, with passable but forgettable
    folk from the likes of Willy Mason between. Holly Golightly gets off
    the comp's best one-liner (""The diamonds you gave me still sparkle
    like diamonds""), Britta Phillips &amp; Dean Wareham offer a rare dud awash
    in hokey new-age sound-effects (it's raining Z's!), Coil's hilariously
    forced rhymes make ""Sex With Sun Ra"" sound worse than celibacy.</p><p>
    
    The loud disc (part dieux) hails from a parallel 2004 where indie
    kids, upon learning how to dance, refused to dance to anything
    smacking of pop. Annie, M.I.A., we hardly knew ye. Gang of Four
    comparisons have grown tiresome because dudes keep boring us in their
    name: Do Me Bad Things (guitar-shredding dance-punk!), Schwab
    (impending lawsuit-mandated name-change dance-punk!), Measles Mumps
    Rubella (vaccinate-your-children-or-you'll-be-forced-to-listen-to-this
    dance-punk!). Liars' noisy change in direction has never been so
    appreciated, nor has Death From Above 1979's visceral magnetism. When
    dancing to guitars grows tiresome, we groove electro: Mu, the Knife,
    the unfortunate new Le Tigre. Alter Ego's ""Rocker"" is a bona fide
    dancefloor filler, and that Throbbing Gristle remix is pretty OK, but
    given a 2004 like this it's no wonder the Rough Trade guys find their
    most pleasant memories in music's past.</p></div>"|2093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2093-rough-trade-shops-counter-culture-04/|6.8|Marc Hogan

In Bessy's corner, NPR's Ken Tucker gave mad props to the band's more, er, ""electrifying"" sound, while roasting Coldplay's soporific set. Not to sound all Darwinist here, but without competition there's little incentive for improvement, which would explain <em>Electrified</em>'s concession to safe, suburbia-friendly new wave. Sure, on 2003's self-titled effort the band spit out their bubblegum sound and assumed a more grown-up persona, but frontwoman Tammy Ealom's miffed sexuality felt like playacting. That album's dolled up production gets dressed to the nines on <em>Electrified</em>, taking its mixing cues from <i>Last Splash while settling for Veruca Salt-caliber songwriting.</i></p><p>
    
    Mid-tempo rocker ""Stop Foolin'"" best summarizes this problematic dichotomy. Innocuous power chords drag along a sedated, Pixies-inflected riff, with both dependent on Ealom's prominent and often nuanced vocals to substantiate the song's pedestrian structure. Ealom almost reconciles these influences on the standout title track, with her coy gasps (""you're six feet tall, electrified!"") and riot grrrl 'tude (""Suspicion, don't push me down/ Your diction is off the wall"") establishing a brusque female libido that would've been squelched on earlier albums. No way Ealom's sultry overemphasis on the first syllable of ""dic-tion"" passes on the fluffy <em>Pink Hearts, Yellow Moons</em>.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately when Ealom sticks her neck out, no one's got her back. <em>Electrified</em>'s rife with cardboard power chord progressions that should've been buried with all the other Nirvana aftermath opportunists. There's literally a stretch of six or seven songs here where I keep thinking I accidentally had the repeat button on. Fortunately the dry spots here aren't egregious, save for some cutesy Saddle Creek moments speckled throughout. Maybe <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>'s right proclaiming the band ""the best thing to come out of Denver since John Elway!"", but if you hold indie supremacy over Colorado's music scene and the Denver Broncos, chances are your band's nothing but paper champs.</p></div>"|2455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2455-electrified/|6.3|Adam Moerder

Well, he does when adding a pained crescendo to the word ""more"" on a song called ""Good Stuff"", from his band's eponymous debut. Other tracks find him tricking out Gary Numan or Robyn Hitchcock c. Soft Boys atop shit-is-bananas synth garb or filching inspirational one-liners (""Each of us is special in our own unique way"") from milquetoast countrymen Embrace.</p><p>
    
    Clor play buzzy, hopped-up indie pop that sounds great with your first caffeine of the day. They're pop in perhaps the most literal sense of the word-- their songs POP out at you, glowing bright blue-green like a Nike tracksuit. Dudes can play, too, and with music this dense (Clor tracks are a frottage of guitar, bass, live drums, drum machine, vocals, and upwards of 14 vintage synthesizers likely purchased on eBay), precision is ne plus ultra. Bios list only five members, which suggests multi-tracking, but that's allowed. These boys nail their notes, and unlike most indie poppers, they can thump. Piloted by chichi sequencers and a house-inflected rhythm, ""Dangerzone"" sounds great coming through walls or from under blankets or with a paper bag over your head.</p><p>
    
    In indie rock, a rigidly self-contained genre whose bands employ strikingly similar sounds and production techniques, the difference between mediocrity and greatness is often, literally, one or two notes. Clor delight in making unexpected stylistic choices. They excel at turning left where most would turn right or not turn at all, and their shiftiness rarely seems forced. Take single ""Love + Pain"". For its first 47 seconds, ""Love + Pain"" teeters on obnoxiousness. Notes bop and bubble in a jittery morass, while Dobbin's nasally vocals claw at nearby skin. It's not <em>bad</em>, just a little nauseating. But then the chorus hits. I'm sorry-- first the <em>pre</em>chorus, i.e., the four bars that make all the difference. Instead of launching into the refrain, with its one-line hook and beeline chord changes, Clor prime the canvas with a palate-cleansing arpeggiated riff. Perfect.</p><p>
    
    Like a stand-up comic who overuses shock value, a band can be unpredictable in very predictable ways. Many Clor-type bands use a glitzy, structurally overloaded approach in order to curry favor with bored listeners. But Clor are master blenders, cobbling together tasty unrelated nuggets and making them seem like sonic soul mates. Opener ""Good Stuff"" superimposes a Hives-y quarter-note riff over an ambiguous instrumental backdrop, in which grainy drum machine and chorus-drenched bass invoke post-wavers Poster Children. ""Hearts of Fire"" rubberizes a benumbed Kraftwerk-style motor groove with guitar and vox, both pliant and catchy, before drifting off in an extended instrumental passage featuring more computers than the Very Large Array. They even get mushy on the immaculate ""Gifted"".</p><p>
    
    So it's a bummer the album fizzles a bit toward the end. Clor are so flashy and blemish-free, they're almost celluloid. They work plasticity to their favor mostly-- and damn that's hard-- but ""Magic Touch"", which is wanky, and ""Making You All Mine"", which is unmemorable, leave a divot in this otherwise excellent album. If Clor were a film, they'd be a shimmering (but hardly weightless), FX-laden blockbuster, and those always drag. But as the shimmering (and often weightless), FX-laden albums of its ilk go, you could do much worse.</p></div>"|1814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1814-clor/|8.2|Sam Ubl

Whether he's remixing the indie pop band     Junior Boys, immersing himself in improv with Fenn O'Berg and     Polwechsel, or crafting dark songs in tandem with David Sylvain,     Fennesz is constantly challenging himself while holding on to and     developing his core style. That he sometimes fails is a testament to     his     willingness to step outside his comfort zone.</p>
<p>Add one-man entertainment industry Ryuichi Sakamoto to Fennesz' long     list of collaborators. This unlikely pair is at present working on an     album together, and this teaser EP consists of a single 19-minute track     they performed live last year at a festival in Italy. Sakamoto has been     working in music too long and in too many contexts to be summed up in a     few words. Being a key member of the Yellow Magic Orchestra is a career     for most, but for Sakamoto YMO was just the beginning. Since then there     have been dozens of records including film scores, vocal pop records,     orchestral compositions, and ambient mood music, not to mention a     number     of acting gigs. Now Sakamoto joins Fennesz shoulder-to-shoulder in     front     of their laptops to fill a concert hall with challenging computer     music.</p>
<p>When I finish this review and put <i>Sala Santa Cecilia</i> back on the CD     shelf, I'm definitely going to file it with my Fennesz releases.     There's     no way for me to know for sure who is doing what in this collaboration,     but the texture and structure of the music fits nicely alongside the     more serene and dreamy passages of <i>Live in Japan</i>. It starts with     the two men tuning their machines, playing with and discarding an     assortment of eerie and uncertain industrial tones, then locking the     pieces that fit into pointy spires of sound. They never stay in one     place long, though, as the music is constantly shifting and being     bumped     off track. During a long stretch of small buzzes and thumps the piece     seems adrift and on the verge of floating away into chaos. But then a     tender symphonic drone, which sounds to me like it was constructed by a     guy with deep understanding of film music and storytelling, pulls the     piece back into itself to close with an extremely long and wistful fade     to black.</p>
<p>Santa Cecilia being the patron saint of church music and this     performance having taken place of Rome, it's not hard to read into this     piece a kind of gothic drama. The long glitchy passage aside, <i>Sala     Santa     Cecilia</i> sounds deep and wide, like it was meant to echo inside an     enormous room with dark stone walls. If I'm understanding the division     of labor correctly, Sakamoto's outsized orchestral flair is an     excellent     compliment to the more fastidious choices made by Fennesz, and the     ideas     presented here, while exciting on their own, bode very well for the     upcoming full-length.</p>

And though there are moments on Baïkonour's full-length debut, <em>For the Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos</em>, that bear comparison to some of the more spacious, iridescent environments of <em>Talkie Walkie</em>, over the album's course Krieger ably distinguishes his work through rigorous, jazz-inflected musicianship and an inspired navigation of spiraling, locomotive Krautrock dynamics.</p><p>

Most of the tracks here feature live drumming provided by Imitation Electric Piano's Lee Adams, and it's often his muscular, hangar-spaced pummel that allows Baïkonour to avoid the stagnant eddies of soporific post-rock. Following the delicate harp-string shimmer of the opening ""Lick Lokoum"", Krieger and Adams immediately kick into the unstoppable motorik-cum-Stax propulsion of ""Coltan Anyone?"" Combining surprisingly humid, greasy rhythms with Krieger's baroque, Floydian keyboard flourishes, this track should provide immediate succor to any waylaid Caribou fans, as it instantly snuffs out any lingering potential for dustless, sci-fi sterility.</p><p>
    This last detail feels particularly pertinent, as Baïkonour takes its name from a Soviet missile launch site and the album's title and artwork both imply a certain Sputnik-era retro-futurism. To the contrary, however, these songs remain stubbornly coarse-textured and earthy, even pastoral, as on ""Hoku To Shin Ken"", a track whose circular melody is fed by tranquil, Byrds-like guitar arpeggios. Elsewhere ""Proto-Coeur"" plows a recharged Peter Gunn riff around and through various hairpin turns and blind alleys, while tracks like ""Rusk Plasmique"" and ""60 To 0"" can recall M83's synthesized My Bloody Valentine atmospheres. Throughout the album, Krieger consistently astonishes with the daring breadth of his playing, as he embellishes several otherwise straightforward pop hooks with as much florid ornamentation as good taste will allow.</p><p>
    Aside from the occasional submerged whisper, as on the classic-Stereolab echoes of ""2/3/74"", <em>For the Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos</em> contains no vocals or lyrics to speak of, but still the album retains the impression of a cohesive, sequential narrative. Culminating with the vibrant surfside pulse of ""Ultra Lazuli"", the album's plotline feels primarily driven by Krieger's skill at flawlessly integrating the various strands of his musical memory and appetites to recast the familiar in new, evocative shades uniquely his own. And this he does with such an addictively melodic flair that it should be easy for listeners to find space for this album within their lonely hearts.</p></div>"|1171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1171-for-the-lonely-hearts-of-the-cosmos/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

    interesting sound built on sharp, no-nonsense rhythm and textural
    guitar
    interplay. In my review of that record, I even hoped for a full album
    from
    the group, which-- as a joint side project of Wire's Colin Newman, Robin
    Rimbaud (aka Scanner), and Minimal Compact's Malka Spigel-- threatened to
    be
    little more than a promising one-off. Well, they've delivered that
    full-length, and though it's very solid, I'm finding myself rather
    wishing
    they'd followed the blueprint of Wire's own <em>Read &amp; Burn</em> series and just
    issued another EP.</p><p>
    
    The Githead sound hasn't changed on the LP, but the songs have
    grown
    longer, and <em>Profile</em> suffers
    as a result of the more long-winded delivery. The band's
    compositions work best in quick bursts, as they were presented on the
    EP,
    but here they stretch them out and work with a narrower palette on each
    song, sometimes dimming their memorability. It could just be that on
    an
    album where the vocals are predominantly spoken and the guitars
    stripped
    back to textural and harmonic roles, the relative lack of melody is
    simply
    more noticeable over a long period of time. Whatever the case, the
    record
    crawls by in a sort of ambient pop vein with a noticeable dub influence
    and
    pads the space between highlights with patches of extreme competence,
    but
    not much more.</p><p>
    
    The highlights are worth the trip, though, especially Spigel's ""My LCA
    (Little Box of Magic)"", a song that slips along on soapy bass and
    clicky
    programming. (The Beat Monster this time is accompanied by live drummer
    Max
    Franken). Spigel's deadpan speaking tone on the verses gives way to a
    chorus that features her multi-tracked voice singing a two-part harmony
    in
    unison with herself, a technique that has the odd effect of adding
    a
    melodic hook to the song without really feeling like a melody.
    Newman's
    spoken word is more forceful and urgently rhythmic on ""Cosmology for
    Beginners"" than on most of the rest of the record, and the song
    benefits
    greatly from the increased intensity.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the stand-out moments are tempered by the generally
    static
    grooves a the kind of compositional streamlining that cuts out a lot of
    the
    good stuff along with the gristle. Instrumentals ""Pylons"" and
    ""Antiphon"" feel like they're building to something bigger but never
    reach
    it, and you have to wait through too much basic time-keeping to get to
    the
    meat of ""Raining Down"". Whether or not this is it for Githead, it's a
    shame
    that <em>Profile</em> doesn't generate the same excitement as their debut, but
    there's enough quality material lurking in there that it's hardly a
    total
    waste. Still, <em>Headgit</em> is quite a bit better, and should be all most
    people
    need from this project.</p></div>"|3661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3661-profile/|6.9|Joe Tangari

Then again, did he ever really have any in the first place? Always more intrepid as a brand-man (how 'bout those UNKLE Gor-Tex coats and action figures!) or ambitious A&amp;R; (let's get Thom Yorke <em>and</em> Richard Ashcroft!) than a DJ or musician, Lavelle has floundered since DJ Shadow renounced the UNKLE name after the release of their still-impressive <em>Psyence Fiction</em> album. Without Shadow's pummeling drums, the Mo' Wax entrepreneur seemed listless on official follow-up <em>Never, Never Land</em>, and his recent limited-edition UNKLE Sounds DJ set CDs have been passable at best. With the likes of Diplo and Rupture cutting, scratching, and bumping far flung sounds by the hour, Lavelle and Sounds collab-buddy Richard File come off as antiquated as some of the random movies they sample on this lazy and unspectacular motion-pictured-themed two-disc set.</p><p>
    
    Originally created for a ""future cinema"" exhibit at London's Institute for the Contemporary Arts, <em>Edit Music</em> basically takes Lavelle's omnipresent love for all things ominous and cinematic and works them into two hour-long DJ sets that haphazardly cut and paste dialogue from dumbfuck obvious flicks like <em>Scarface</em> and <em>Kill Bill</em> alongside slightly tweaked seven-year-old UNKLE jams (""Lonely Soul""), and continuity-foiling soundtrack picks like Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" (<em>Almost Famous</em>) and Chris Isaak's ""Bad Bad Thing"" (<em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>).</p><p>
    
    Disc One is introduced by the horn-blaring 20th Century Fox theme and such cutesy flourishes (yes, the THX noise-blast and <em>2001</em> theme are here too) render these discs throwaway silly. Once the (quaint) thrill of Name That Movie dies down, there's little left besides sometimes pulsing, sometimes ambient soundtrack music that hardly coalesces into a thematic whole (an implicit goal thanks to the frustrating lack of individual track breaks). The image conscious spinner seemingly spent more time on the album's stark quasi-Vader cover than the actual mix; Lavelle's once-refreshing anything-goes ethos has fallen into aimless self-parody as he's now outdone by creative, open-minded mp3 blog-mixers on a daily basis.</p><p>
    
    Even for the few trenchant UNKLE obsessives left, this liner notes-less import is not only unessential but also kind of sad. Foolishly slaving to a lame at-the-movies blueprint, Lavelle ignores the most exciting British beat-styles of today (ahem, grime) and sticks with his trademark doomsday sludge that now sounds as creaky as a knee-jerk John Williams score. Dude should stick to pawning those tres unique (read: fugly) new UNKLE-Nike Dunks on eBay--$102.50 with an hour left!</p></div>"|8359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8359-edit-music-for-a-film-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-reconstruction/|3.8|Ryan Dombal

And it's subtitled like we've been waiting for it for a long, long time-- which is true, but only to an extent. For the past nine years, Pop's career has been summarized only by the single-disk <i>Nude &amp; Rude: The Best of Iggy Pop, which tried to explain a complex artist in only 17 tracks. Even to an initiate, <em>Nude &amp; Rude</em></i> had to seem only cursory-- a problem <em>A Million in Prizes</em> seeks to correct. It collects 38 tracks from nearly 40 years (!), including alternate takes, non-album tracks, and live cuts. It renders its predecessor immediately obsolete-- look for <em>N&amp;R; to flood your local used CD store-- and is probably as good a Pop retrospective as we're likely to get on two disks.</em></p><p>
    
    Most collections like this give us an opportunity to reassess an artist's accomplishments and reconsider the shape and effect of their output. <em>A Million in Prizes: The Anthology</em>, however, seems just the opposite: several years of revisiting and reconsidering his past work have finally culminated in a retrospective anthology that might be the crest of a second wave that started with <i>Trainspotting (did it really? or did it just seem to?) and has been building ever since. In the intervening decade, Pop has become a legend to the garage rock bands and punk nostalgics while remaining a guiding saint to throngs of disaffected adolescents (including the dropout who used to blare ""Lust for Life"" in the apartment above me all hours of the day and night). Todd Haynes made a movie about him, Jim Jarmusch made a movie with him, and we here at Pitchfork placed four Iggy-related albums on our Top 100 Albums of the 70s list. </i></p><p>
    
    Murmured rumors and outright statements claim that Pop's the father of both punk and the garage-rock revival. While it's tempting to assign that extra meaning to his stage surname, influence does not necessary produce a positive paternity test. Pop is punk only in retrospect. Instead of defining a movement (that already had a leg up with MC5 and wouldn't hit full steam for several more years), the Stooges simply stripped 50s rock and roll down to its animal essence-- broken-glass blues riffs, steady backbeats, and punctuating hand claps-- then exaggerated its hedonistic appetites and self-destructive tendencies to brutish, nearly comic proportions on their first three albums, which are represented by 10 tracks on <i>A Million in Prizes-- almost a fourth of the compilation.</i></p><p>
    
    I can't really argue with that. The Stooges' distillation of rock is no small feat, but Pop wasn't a first amendment pioneer. A succession of 60s artists from Jim Morrison to Lou Reed had already cleared the way for Pop's anarchic aesthetic, but just as this lineage doesn't dull his music, neither does it dull his legacy. Instead, it points out his distinct accomplishment-- the performative aspect of his music. It wasn't the lyrics that made his songs dangerous, but Pop's yelping insistence, the depraved howls that punctuated his verses and hid a curiously smooth baritone. Just like his body, his voice was wiry and exposed and graceful, slithering and bleeding and peanut-buttery.</p><p>
    
    The first disk of <em>A Million in Prizes showcases this aspect of Pop's music, but the second disk has the unenviable task of summing up everything since, from </em><em>New Values</em> and <em>Soldier to </em><em>Beat Em Up and </em><em>Skull Ring. Admittedly, there are some incredible moments: the live cut of ""TV Eye"" from the 1993 Feile Festival in Ireland suggests Pop hasn't lost as much edge on stage as he has in the studio. Two duets stand out: he and B-52 Kate Pierson are well matched on the wistful ""Candy"", and he and Debbie Harry have a goof with Cole Porter's ""Well, Did You Evah!"" from </em><em>Red Hot + Blue</em>. And even though it mercifully omits his collaboration with Peaches, the second disk can't possibly match the first for sheer raw power. Really, who could keep it up that long?</p><p>
    
    But <em>A Million in Prizes</em> tells a story that's greater than the individual tracks themselves, one that elevates even the dimmest of material. Even so, there's something a little sad about seeing such a vital artist canonized like this. Greatest hits compilations are round holes into which pegs of every shape are fitted, and they tend to have a neutering effect, absorbing rebel music into the very system it once railed against. Even though <em>A Million in Prizes accomplishes exactly what it set out to do, it's difficult to get excited about this collection, especially with upcoming reissues of </em><em>The Stooges</em> and <em>Fun House</em> to look forward to.</p></div>"|6410.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6410-a-million-in-prizes-the-anthology/|7.9|Stephen M.

And that's perfect, because it gives me something to talk about. He wants to call himself ""raw garage rock energy,"" go ahead. Nobody's exactly guarding the doors to the genre these days, but Mr. Vek managed to slip in without the one fuck-all must-have accessory. No, not a Blackberry-- I'm talking hammy riffs.</p><p>
    Now, lead <em>bass lines</em>, there's another story. Matter fact, Mr. Vek is not averse to melody-- quite the contrary-- just the melodious thunks come from unexpected sources. Opener ""C-C (You Set the Fire in Me)"" (which is opposite how the titular chorus is actually delivered) locks the high school funk jammers in the garage and positions the four-track at or around the local gas station. Safely distanced, we catch tinny drums and wormy bass-- all we need, thanks.</p><p>
    The bulk of <em>We Have Sound</em>'s 10 tracks are as described. Mr. Vek stands interestingly aloof from his backing band (himself), sprinkling on yawning synth swells and, yawn, reverbed vocals. Some will hear the prominent rhythms and levy him with Gang of Four-ish comparisons, but I'm hearing more Hanson. Must be the locks. Actually, a song like ""I Ain't Saying My Goodbyes"" (single) would be a radio smash if a) Mr. Vek had a Blackberry, and b) he used it to contact Sony. Instead, he'll have to settle for heavy rotation on my iTunes playlist marked ""Radio"", next to Dangerdoom and ""Konichiwa Bitches"".</p><p>
    And, ya know, bias aside, that ain't such a bad place for a 24-year-old London beau whose name isn't Kano. Remove the begging-to-be-DFA-remixed ""If You Want"" and the blatant Talking Heads rip ""Nothing But Green Lights"", Mr. Vek has himself a solid, solid record here. Of those two songs I just zinged, the latter one actually isn't bad. So-- droll sung/spoken vox, chirruping synth loop, mind-numbing repetition-- it carbon copies ""Once in a Lifetime"". Try writing a song that doesn't! I only wish that Mr. Vek, when he isn't plagiarizing or talking about cars (all the time), would ditch the blasé monotone and work his falsetto. When Venn diagraming standout ""I Ain't Saying Goodbyes"" and the déclassé ""Cover"", a simple neck crane seems, indeed, the missing ingredient.</p><p>
    With a penchant for sloppy dance beats and an ear for sonic minutiae, Tom Vek unites skill sets as antipodal as Rapture and Elvrum. But considering one cannot legally, <a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E5D91E30F93AA25754C0A9639C8B63"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>conscientiously</u></a> or <a href=""http://indierock4eva.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>sincerely</u></a> enjoy indie rock anymore, <em>We Have Sound</em> puts me in an awkward spot.</p></div>"|8540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8540-we-have-sound/|7.6|Sam Ubl

On their second album <em>Four Winds the Walker</em>, the foursome emit such inspired gusts of collective fire that they resemble a witches' coven almost as much as a band, their shadow-draped music seeming to issue forth organically from the soil like a sulfurous hot spring.</p><p>
    
    The group consists of Georgia Vallas, Kathleen Baird, Tracy Peterson, and Taralie Peterson, whose supremely scrambled solo work <i>The Artist Revealed is Tarlie Dawn was released under the name Tar Pet earlier this year. Together the four employ a variety of hand percussion and other atypical instrumentation including cello, banjo, African mbira, and Japanese bul bul tarang, all while keeping each musician's individual role fluid and undefined. Hence there is no single lead singer as such, as throughout the album multiple voices swirl and caper from unexpected directions like a swarm of inquisitive fireflies.</i></p><p>
    
    This freewheeling approach yields strange but alluring fruit on songs like ""Little For a Lot"", where, behind the song's main chorus, the backing vocals appear to be literally mewing like kittens. On more dissonant tracks like ""Sheye"" or the sawing drone of ""Born in a Room"", the vocals sound uncannily like those of Comus' <em>First Utterance</em>, bearing less similarity to traditional pastoral folk than to the theatricality of 70s UK prog-rock. Perhaps most astonishing of all is ""This Ain't For Mama"", a swirling magic carpet of insect-like hums and tribal percussion that is interjected with strident, almost punkish snarls, conjuring something like an imaginary collaboration between Babes in Toyland's Kat Bjelland and the Master Musicians of Jajouka.</p><p>
    
    Many of the most captivating passages on <em>Four Winds the Walker</em>, however, occur when the Spires stretch their songs and put their restlessly inventive combinations of instruments to work. On cuts like ""Ong Song"" or ""Shining"" the group match their curious string instruments and tuned percussion (or perhaps that's the bul bul tarang I'm hearing) in a manner that recalls Harry Partch's hobo jungle, while the cracked hoedown of ""Imaginary Skin"" features some marvelously bent fiddle that eventually gives way to a wordless vocal hayloft serenade. When operating at their peak, which is the case on much of <em>Four Winds the Walker</em>, Spires That in the Sunset Rise can invoke the unbounded, ageless music one might expect to hear emanating from the deepest forest, as mysterious black-cloaked figures dance around the fire-ring. Whether that sounds more like a warning or an invitation is left up to the traveler.</p></div>"|7823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7823-four-winds-the-walker/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

    That's three syllables, tra-la-la, unless it's tra-la-<em>la</em>. But
    either way there's actually seven, four girls acclaimed for their
    bangs plus three guys semi-acclaimed for banging on instruments. They
    do this to form notes, which can be used for chords. Tralala rely on
    just a few, sometimes three! But those must be enough because tiny
    sinus-infected lunch-recess vox fill out the rest, courtesy mostly of
    the four with bangs.</p><p>
    
    No, not Bangs: Meltzer. Of course three of these guy/girls already
    maybe know that, having employment experience with the same Greenwich
    Village record store that birthed Animal
    Collective. Tralala's kingdom is far simpler: Ramones-y NYC
    fuzz and girl-group social agony stuck in
    bubblegum pop. Hello Raveonettes, right? But that's another
    story for a different subway stop. Tralala are recently corrupted
    naifs wandering heartsick through a shadowy
    cinematic Gotham.</p><p>
    
    Except a song like ""The Girls Say"" is pretty seriously solid, put-on
    or no. It stands out through sheer force of ""ba ba ba-ba ba daaa da""
    and yes subtleties like a nervous (please god not pregnant) pause
    between ""de-"" and ""-flate"" at the end of a line. Our narrator loves a certain boy because
    he's beautiful-- or is he beautiful because other girls say she
    should love him? ""I trust my friends, but I can't trust myself,"" she
    laments, and any critic of the human primate's pack instinct knows that's not a problem of youth alone.</p><p>
    
    For all the handclaps and harmonies, Tralala are at least as
    not-that-innocent as Skye Sweetnam, with or without her collagen
    hookup. Too-rote opener ""All Fired Up"" sure sounds like it's about
    sex. Same with rootsier closer ""Like This"": ""Feels so good, oh baby/
    Let's do it again"". Shocking, I know. ""No/Yeah"" even conjures up
    carnival cruises with ""Lust for Life"" drums and more girlish lust.
    Sample lyric: ""Am I just some kid to you?"" Bland mimickry also weakens
    ""Everybody's Doin' Fine"", which reminds us that Judy was a punk before
    she was a dick slap. All of which brings us back to Number One, bummer
    your girlfriend says that's gross.</p></div>"|8292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8292-tralala/|6.1|Marc Hogan

    lo-fi rock. From the
    crawling beat and dramatic dead stops of the opener, ""I Am the Contact
    Kid"", this album begs for your attention. Yet while it keeps a consistent sound and
    atmosphere, <em>Contact Kid</em> would be easier to swallow if it skipped happily
    by on non-stop Casio beats, but ""I Am the Contact Kid"" and other songs are surprisingly sober. Thin, detuned guitars, distorted
    drum machines, and bristling garage-sale keyboards all hope to remind
    you of the lo-fi all-stars in your CD collection, while the vocals are
    delivered with marbles in the mouth and a tongue in the cheek,
    Valley-girl style.</p><p>
    
    It's a convincing recreation, but most lo-fi bands work with those production values out of necessity; Mixel
    Pixel do it for style. They're not the first to record this way just
    for aesthetics (recent bands like Unicorns and Single Frame spring to
    mind), but at the very least, those other artists had memorable songs. Nothing about this band is subtle, so the more minimal the songs are,
    the better: ""Penny Rocket/Romantic"" creeps along on low arpeggios and
    whispered vocals, and the open space within the song holds as much weight
    as the instruments. The instrumental ""Gas House Gables"" is a curveball
    highlight with a deft balance between quirky sound effects and
    pleasant melody.</p><p>
    
    Yet these moments are few. ""Mantis Rock"" runs through every gimmick at
    the band's disposal, with the exception of a hook. Cutesy tracks like
    ""At the Arcade"" sound even more forced and affected (though the
    video-game breakdown at the end is pretty cool). The singer rants over static
    and a moseying beat in ""Little Wolverine"", aiming for aloof but ending
    up dull, and ""Out of My Mind"" is like being stuck in a 5 x 5 room with
    the most annoying guy at a party-- and he's got an acoustic guitar.</p><p>
    
    While those tracks are grating, they're among the few songs with any
    impact. There's nothing wrong with wearing your influences on your

    ""instru-metal"") tend toward the hyperbolic. Maybe the stab at
    heightened language highlights an attempt to pad the lacking libretto; or
    perhaps without voices covering-up aspects of the instrumentation, we
    subconsciously connect the work to pure nonhuman landscapes like
    towering mountains and multilayered constellations, et al. Whatever
    the case, the guys of Pelican don't need fancy prose because the
    Chicago quartet aims for such oxygen-free highs that any over-the-top
    words I scribble are more or less a reenactment of what they've put to
    tape.</p><p>
    
    ""Epic"" is <em>the</em> single most overused word in the context of notey
    crews like Don Caballero (or Battles), Red Sparowes, and Isis: It
    finds its way into discussion out of habit, but it's hard to prove via
    any visible calculations what's truly deserving of the descriptor and
    what's just fucking long. On their sophomore full-length, Pelican
    certainly know how to go for broke and then continue going and going
    and going. But are they really worthy of being linked to the <i>Odyssey?
    Three of
    the seven tracks here last for more than 10 minutes, one's just under 10, and the
    other three each tread at around five. In many cases, Pelican
    enjamb enough dynamic shifts into the compositions to keep things
    interesting, or at least varied, but I'm still searching for a final
    explosion.</i></p><p>
    
    A plus: Unlike many instrumentalists, Pelican don't affix over-long
    stage-direction-style titles to their compositions. Besides the dorky album
    title (<em>wait</em>-- you guys never speak, so we're gonna freeze
    forever? is that the hook?), they let their music do the talking.
    Song-by-song there's a tendency toward seasonal shifts and the sky:
    ""Last Day of Winter"", ""Autumn Into Summer"", ""Aurora Borealis"", and
    ""Sirius"". And while the songs don't necessarily sound like their
    tags, they at least plant a generality in the listener's head.</p><p>
    
    Those are the structures. It's more difficult explaining exactly what
    it actually sounds like. For starters, despite critical fixations to
    the contrary, <i>Fire... isn't very metal. The heavier/murkier debut,
    <em>Australasia</em>, was certainly within that realm and fit the critical
    shorthand, but here the production's ultra clean (sorta pristine), the
    atmosphere's airy (check out those acoustic transitions), and the
    songs delve into poppier areas than anything they've done in the
    past. Maybe it's safer to evoke Oren Ambarchi jamming with Trans Am.</i></p><p>
    
    Coming up with proper genre identification's difficult, but diagramming the
    specific's of each song's even rougher (cataloguing the twists and
    turns of each track requires college-level geometry). To speak in the
    vaguest terms, their attack falls into two over-arching camps: They
    either riff through those aforementioned ""epics"" or drop-off more
    incidental sounding shortish pieces.</p><p>
    
    The strongest marathon, ""March Into the Sea"", just under 12 minutes
    long, is the most ""metal."" There's nimble double bass drum and an
    interestingly treated cymbal crash. It's less atmospheric than some of
    the others. The first thought in my head, ""Spacious Fucking
    Champs."" Late in the track there's a sort of break down into pretty,
    jangling arpeggios. You know how Slash would always play his solos in
    the middle of the desert or something during those Guns-n-Roses
    videos? Well, ""March Into the Sea"" deserves to be unleashed in such
    extreme conditions. On the other hand, ""Red Ran Amber"", which begins
    promisingly with patented Unwound-style feedback, wanders into a
    whirlpool at some point and forgets to re-emerge.</p><p>
    
    Amongst the briefer bits (spaghetti western, underwater surf music),
    the best (and most surprising) is the untitled fourth piece, a pile of
    moody acoustic Gypsy strumming with shaker percussion. Here, the
    instruments feel like they've been lassoed into closer quarters. Queensryche fans might cry ""Silent Lucidity"", but
    the rest of us will note that toward the end things crackle for a
    moment and then fingers on strings make discordant noises briefly. If
    you didn't know better, this might be Espers or Ben Chasny doing the
    backstroke through tiny wafts of radio fuzz.</p><p>
    
    By and large, Pelican keep things moving. Still, at certain moments my
    attention wandered and I couldn't help but wonder who would be their
    ideal singer if they held their own ""Rock Star: INXS"" reality show.
    Truth is, the attack plateaus here/there, and just then it'd be
    excellent to introduce a screamer or sigher to push the elements
    toward that final Wagnarian movement that finds our aching, B-12
    deficient hero climbing a mountain to embrase his (or her) too-lost
    love. My votes: The guys from Mineral and St. Vitus (as a team),
    King Diamond (solo), the woman in Evanescence, or the father from ""The
    Sound of Music"". Vocal-free, they never quite pull off that snow-capped
    climax.</p></div>"|6581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6581-the-fire-in-our-throats-will-beckon-the-thaw/|7.0|Brandon Stosuy

    Chinatown. The space was used mainly
    for
    showings of independent short films and the band played on the floor
    with
    projections behind them, filling the room with their dense, rippling
    waves
    of what they refer to as ""massed guitar, violoncelli, voice &amp;
    electronics.""
    The moment I remember best was when the band built a monumental drone
    around a single chord while an image of white metal beams slowly
    shifted
    behind them. As the image moved, the texture of the drones shifted,
    and
    finally it became clear that the footage was shot on a Ferris wheel,
    with
    the camera initially aimed at the direct center of the wheel to create
    an
    almost abstract visual. It was an audio-visual feast, to say the
    least.</p><p>
    
    On record, Mahogany aren't exactly prolific, having
    released
    just one full-length in nearly 10 years as a band, but they've turned
    out a
    couple more albums' worth of scattered tracks on EPs, split 7""'s, and
    compilations in that time, which is the stuff <em>Memory Column</em> focuses on
    over
    the course of its two discs. Disc One is subtitled ""Song Cycle No. 1
    for
    Rural Michigan"", and the implication is that its 10 songs,
    recorded from 1996 to 1999, were intended to form a unified body of
    work, a
    promise that actually bears itself out pretty well. Disc Two, subtitled ""Song Cycle No. 2
    for
    Detroit &amp; New York"", gathers music from 1999 to 2004 and covers the
    period
    during which they relocated from the Motor City to NYC. Generally
    speaking, these
    arrangements are more intricate and varied than those on the first disc.</p><p>
    
    Mahogany's music falls broadly into the part of the dream-pop spectrum
    that
    emphasizes the dream over the pop, placing them in a similar space with
    Surface of Ecion, Landing, and Auburn Lull, with whom Mahogany's most-tenured member, Andrew Prinz, has played.
    Song
    titles like ""The Singing Arc-Lamp"" do almost as much to explain the
    sound of
    the music as I could in 150 words. By the middle of Disc Two, though,
    the
    sound begins to branch out, with ""Semaphore Streamlines"" and ""Bunker
    Soldiers"" embracing a more post-punk sensibility, the latter mixing
    melodica
    with bobbing synth and an odd, chanting vocal arrangement that breaks
    away
    from the band's more typical wispy harmonies and solo vocals.</p><p>
    
    Those wispy vocals do sound good, though, set in amongst guitars
    that
    go on for miles. They give the music's ephemeral arrangements
    interesting
    rhythms to play off of, too, laying on a thick, shimmering drone over a
    delay-drenched ponging noise on ""Amelia No. 2"". A lot of bands playing
    in
    this territory have songs that are basically interchangeable, but
    Mahogany
    don't fall into that trap-- even their earliest music takes care to
    introduce
    counter-melodies and allow the rhythm section (which is sometimes a
    machine)
    time to make its own statement.</p><p>
    
    Having all of this music, originally scattered over a collectors'
    nightmare
    of rare and hard to find discs, in one place is nice enough from a
    completist standpoint, but what's more impressive about <em>Memory Column</em>
    is
    that it illustrates a band's evolution while also presenting two very
    cohesive discs that each make a strong statement as suites. People who
    are
    into dream pop and classic UK shoegazer rock need to give this band a
    listen, as they're among the best bands currently doing this stuff, and
    if
    <em>Memory Column</em> is any indication, hearing their continued evolution will
    be a
    pleasure.</p></div>"|5047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5047-memory-column-early-works-rarities-mcmxcvi-mmiv/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    will very likely do the trick. In fact, with each subsequent release
    the quintet's ""horror-jazz"" grows increasingly refined (i.e.
    incredibly fucking spare).</p><p>
    And hey, they've been at it awhile: Thorsten Benning, Morten Gass,
    Reiner Henseleit (who left the band in 1996 and was replaced a year
    later by the ivory-tickling saxophonist Christoph Clöser) and Robin
    Rodenberg began playing together in 1988, mining a metallic hardcore
    sound. Subsequently, as Bohren, they released <i>Gore Motel</i> in 1994,
    followed by the 2xCD <i>Midnight Radio</i> (1995), <i>Sunset Mission</i> (2000), and <em>Black Earth</em> (2002; reissued on Ipecac in 2004). Bohren's
    forth studio album, <i>Geisterfaust</i>, is translated from the German as
    ""Ghost Fist,"" but the five extended pieces feel more like ghostly
    tip-toes. Admittedly, though, each track's titled with a finger theme,
    so I suppose my idea wouldn't work. Besides, there's a fistful of
    heaviness breathing within the airy wraps of bass (kontra, fretless,
    8-string), tuba, and bass trombone and the exceedingly spacious Fender
    Rhodes, sax, and brushed drums.</p><p>
    Bohren are often dubbed horror-jazz, though this hardly defines the
    sound. Consider, maybe, the recent crop of
    jazz-oriented Rune Grammofon released by Nils Okland and In The
    Country (featuring Morten Qvenild of the hyperactive Shining) or even
    something as downcast as non-jazz labelmates Deathprod, then remove
    1/2 of the notes and replace any and all folksiness and/or Blue Note
    overtones with foreboding minimalist dirge and a Sunn 0))) or Khanate
    streak. Now, mix in some John Cage, because <i>Geisterfaust</i> showcases
    Bohren as masters of silence, using space and shadows rather than
    volume increases or additional sounds to create (and maintain)
    dynamics.</p><p>
    The tracks here are all relatively long, but the most expansive in all
    senses is the grandiloquent 20-minute opener, ""Zeigefinger"" (""Index
    Finger""), wherein they lug in a tuba and a nine-person choir. The track
    plods into the starting gate. Pauses continue to grow. Tones sustain
    miraculously. Voices rise in the background like traces of frozen
    powder. The drums increase in
    heaviness, but never break out. It's an appropriate way to start the LP-- you'd be hard-pressed to
    locate a single riff or roll on the entire album. The three of the
    remaining pieces-- ""Daumen"" (""Thumb""), ""Ringfinger"", and
    ""Mittelfinger""-- fall into a similar line, with varying degrees of
    percussion and bass, and more or less pronounced vibraphone
    (""Ringfinger,"" for instance, just about establishes a mallet hook).</p><p>
    The final composition, ""Kleinerfinger"" (""Pinky"") comes closest to the
    sound of past releases, a more crumbling ""Twin Peaks"" soundtrack on
    Codeine (band, not drug). But ""Kleinerfinger"" lacks that ineffible
    heavy feel (background built on octave-downed bass?). It features a
    steady high-hat and snare rattles like a slow motion whirlpool; there
    are also beautiful electric piano accents and a smoky saxophone. The
    most upbeat of the pieces (which isn't saying too much) as well as the
    most straightforward jazz, it's also the least interesting.</p><p>
    Bohren &amp; Der Club Of Gore have been championed regularly (and
    fervently) by the fine folks at Aquarius Records in San Francisco, and
    they'd appeal to listeners of black
    metal as well as drone (Stephen O'Malley gives them
    props on his website). But for all of that gloom/doom, I could also
    see them appealing to fans of minimalist ambience and spare
    electronics, as well those who enjoy adventurous ""out"" jazz. But
    regardless of your genre identification, you'd do best to turn this
    up, concentrate, and let it work its way into your head.</p></div>"|1170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1170-geisterfaust/|7.6|Brandon Stosuy

    rhetorical strategies to examine the nature of fair use in an age when
    corporate media outlets are fighting battles on the
    grassroots, unregulated frontier of the internet. How copyright law
    affects artists and consumers is a topic on which Negativland is
    well-qualified to hold forth, having spent their career pushing
    against the boundaries of fair use to demonstrate how it impedes
    artistic progress and serves record companies more than the artists it
    avers to protect.</p><p>
    The first angle is an essay called ""Two Relationships to a Cultural
    Public Domain"". Even though it's fairly even-handed, it is essentially
    polemical in nature, lucidly outlining the cultural developments and
    opposing points of view that will be more obliquely addressed on the
    CD. The crux is that the internet has galvanized a drastic ideological
    polarization as to what constitutes the public domain. The mainstream
    record industry's position is a throwback to when cultural product was
    replicated via physical means, which spawned material artifacts of
    limited supply and calculable monetary value. The opposing position
    stems from the prominence of digital media, which eliminates the
    need for costly physical production and places the power of
    reproduction and dissemination in the hands of anyone with a computer.
    It states that the internet is public domain, a concept that's
    anathema to free market capitalism.</p><p>
    You can easily guess which side of the debate Negativland takes up.
    The essay goes on to outline the history and cultural ramifications of
    copyright law, from its stifling of ""folk art"" (since folk art is a
    communal, viral process more concerned with transmission of heritage
    than singularity) and collage-based art, to the flaws inherent in the
    record industry's m.o. that make this potentially beneficial
    development a threat to its sustainability. The essay closes with a
    clarion call for an expanded, more sensible definition of fair use,
    one that protects original works from being plagiarized outright and
    assures that their creators are compensated for them, while
    decriminalizing derivative works of satire and reinterpretation, thus
    no longer impeding what has become our era's most vibrant art \xD0 the
    art of appropriation and collage. </p><p>
    As opposed to the didactic nature of the booklet, the audio portion of
    <em>No Business</em> tends more toward arch satire of the ongoing debate
    over fair use in digital media, creating a précis of its
    contradictions and ideological schisms rather than advancing a
    particular thesis. Some pieces simply intend to display the artistic
    possibilities inherent in collage, and are more humorous than
    pedagogical: The title track recasts Ethel Merman's ""There's No
    Business Like Show Business"" as a tirade against
    entertainment-industry iniquity instead of a giddy celebration of it,
    and ""Favorite Things"" rearranges the Julie Andrews classic into an
    appreciation of the grotesque: ""Wild brown girls tied up in warm
    strings/ Wild wild white girls that melt into nose cream/ These are
    a few of my favorite things."" Other pieces delight in the absurd, like
    ""Piece a Pie"", a mid-century radio drama chopped up into some sort of
    hellish recursive time loop, like <em>Groundhog Day</em> in a diner. But
    the album's centerpiece must be ""Downloading"", a long and ominously
    weighted mash-up of anti-filesharing speeches, Disney's <em>The Little
    Mermaid</em> (""It won't cost much/ Just your voice!""), and other
    wildly disparate sources, which seems to intend to limn the urgency
    and complexity of the debate over filesharing more than to stake out a
    specific ideological position. </p><p>
    The third stage in this three-pronged statement is a whoopee cushion
    emblazoned with that infamous and iconic ""\xA9"", and perhaps it's this
    portion of <em>No Business</em> that states Negativland's stance on the
    issue most clearly: ""THBBBBBBBBBT!"" </p></div>"|5740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5740-no-business/|7.5|Brian Howe

He has releases on some of the genre's biggest and most seminal labels, including Moving Shadow, Renegade Hardware, and John B's Beta. He is as comfortable with rigid electro-steppers as breakneck break splicing and drooling drumfunk. The first track, ""Silicon Chop"", is a collaboration between Exile and Sub Focus, currently the king of peak-time super-rave drum &amp; bass via his releases on Ram like ""X-Ray"".</p><p>
    
    But, as with many English techheads who prefer the bucolic splendor of the Midlands, he's also something of a rotter. <em>Pro Agonist</em>, for example, is on Mike ""U-Ziq"" Paradinas' Planet Mu label. Despite being home to the collected works of jungle god Remarc, the label's concept of jungle owes much to the Squarepusher tempo tantrum school. And though his tunes often do feature a traditional junglist structure-- intro/drop/breakdown/drop/outro-- Exile can't resist corroding that framework with digital abuse.</p><p>
    
    The aforementioned ""Silicon Chop"" and ""Open Mike"" imagine a tentative bridgehead between big-room drum &amp; bass and the micro-intensities of the Inperspective Records choppage scene. ""Silicon Chop"" takes a fat, cheesy synth hook aimed straight at the teenage raver as the eye of its hurricane of metallic, scuttling bongos, phased snares, and ants-in-your-pants drum bits. ""The Forever Endeavor"" stomps like gabba, shoots random bursts of breaks into the air, and gouges you with cattle prod synth surges. ""Sure You Did"" samples a few of his pals' incredulity at his own fucked up beats in true Aphexian fashion. And that's where things take a bit of a wrong turn.</p><p>
    
    ""Mushroom Santa"" features an excessively twee ""childlike"" melody married to shrill, chipper drill &amp; bass beats that even the biggest spunk jazz apologist would have to call a joke. (And even if it is, I still ended up skipping it from the second play on.) ""Spring Cum Air"" is slightly better with its Selected Ambient Works II atmosphere and flurries of computer pings and plucks, as if Derek Bailey suddenly took up a iBook. His remix of John B's ""Broken Language"" sounds like eight different drum &amp; bass tunes sutured messily together on the fly with a pocket knife and some cinnamon dental floss.</p><p>
    
    ""The Devil's Chimney""-- with creepy ""the devil is in exile"" sample followed by an avalanche of EQ'd-to-fuck ""Amen"" snares and gothic rave stabs-- is straight forward enough for one of the more brutalist neo-techstep labels. It makes me sound like an old disco grouch to prefer this to the more ""my jazz is useless"" pervert-o glitch like ""Rage Is The Beautiful Light That Struck Her"". (Oy, those titles.) I guess I had been hoping for more tunes like ""Silicon Chop"" and his excellent 2005 single ""Cut By Plastic"". Records that sprouted unsightly moles and hair in odd places but were still recognizably drum &amp; bass. Instead I got that plus a side of ProTools fuzz and kooky samples about chiming penises. If that's more your thing, you can look at is as getting a side of a few really forward-thinking dance tunes. And then wash that beard.</p></div>"|2931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2931-pro-agonist/|6.9|Jess Harvell

    long-overdue re-examination. Recent
    mentions of the early 1980s Scottish band are generally shaped around
    the notion that they're the most
    direct ancestor of fellow countrymen Franz Ferdinand, and that they
    also
    did bands like Belle and
    Sebastian no small favors. Some have even suggested that they're one
    of
    the key antecedents for the
    indie pop/rock aesthetic-- in particular, the strain that
    trades
    in jangly, shambolic guitars,
    a healthy obsession with the Velvet Underground, and self-deprecating
    lyrics. While Mission of Burma
    and Hüsker Dü were laying the groundwork and setting the bar high for
    the U.S. indie rock sound and style
    of the 1980s, Orange Juice and fellow Scots Josef K, Aztec Camera, and the major-label Altered Images were shaping the
    decade's UK model.</p><p>
<em>The Glasgow School</em> collects Orange Juice's first four singles-- all recorded for Alan Horne's fabled Postcard label-- and
    what was to be the band's debut LP, <em>Ostrich Churchyard</em>. That
    album wasn't issued until 1992. Instead,
    they suffered one of the first indie backlashes when they scrapped that
    record's low-rent guitar-pop and
    released a re-recorded and far more polished version of it for major
    label Polydor. They also got burned
    in the process when the label selected their Al Green cover ""L.O.V.E.
    Love"" as a single rather than one
    of the band's original and more representative compositions. (That
    Green track would get a second life
    as a Scots indie pop bellwether almost 20 years later when it inspired
    the key lyric to Belle and
    Sebastian's ""Legal Man"".)</p><p>
    The pop kid in me slightly favors that Polydor release, <i>You Can't
    Hide Your Love Forever</i>, which
    has long been one of my default answers when queried for my favorite
    album of all time. And yet, <i>The
    Glasgow School</i> is in many ways a more welcome and fitting
    introduction to a band whose early, almost
    uniformly excellent material has not only languished in out-of-print
    limbo but is difficult to acquire
    even via file-sharing services. This new Domino compilation is a more
    complete document and a better
    re-telling of a story that, if rock's history writers had more
    imagination, a better ear, and dug further
    beyond what charted, would rate a few pages rather than a few
    footnotes.</p><p>
    History (and ideas about what's ""important"" or ""seminal"") aside, the main
    reason this disc is so necessary is
    because of the songs themselves, nuggets of fey, quirky, smart
    indie pop. It starts with the
    band's earliest singles, A- and B-sides laid next to one another. The
    A's (""Falling and Laughing"",
    ""Blueboy"", ""Simply Thrilled Honey"", and ""Poor Old Soul [Pt. 1]"") and the standout B-side (""Lovesick"")
    have a robust charm-- chugging guitars and galloping beats, all played
    with an innocent enthusiasm and
    wide-eyed romanticism. Of course, Orange Juice seem as confused about
    how to go about being pop stars
    as frontman Edwyn Collins' lyrics can be about how to win girls, but in
    each case they're so disarmingly
    charismatic that their faults are forgiven. A pair of rave-up
    near-instrumentals, the slight,
    too-precious stumble of ""Breakfast Time"", and a reprisal of ""Poor Old
    Soul"" that alludes to the Subway
    Sect's famous lyric, ""We oppose all rock 'n' roll""-- fill out
    <i>Glasgow</i>'s first half.</p><p>
    Inspired by punk, incarnations of Orange Juice had existed since 1976,
    although they approached that
    Year Zero with constructive rather than destructive tendencies. OJ was
    buoyed by the Sex Pistols,
    Buzzcocks, Subway Sect, etc., and the music press (OJ co-founder Steven Daly first approached Collins
    while waiting for a schoolbus upon noticing Collins reading an issue of <i>Melody
    Maker</i>) to go out and do something.
    ""Leapt onstage, though we couldn't play/ Furthermore, we had nothing to
    say,"" they claim, but what they
    shared with Britain's first-wave punks was a desire to democratize the
    UK music industry and a healthy
    distrust and disgust toward contemporary and arch-American rock clichés such as
    blues-based, rootsy guitar.</p><p>
    That's not to suggest that OJ weren't students of American culture--
    far
    from it-- but they preferred
    pre-Beatles or soul-boy models, moving over the course of the 1970s
    from
    Teddy Boys to wearing Davy
    Crockett hats to budget mod looks-- all with an increasing acumen for
    playing pop with hints of Stax
    soul and disco. They perfected all of this on their aborted debut,
    penning ball-of-nerves blends of
    CBGBs and Studio 54 and effete proto-indie pop alongside the
    narcotic VU-like ballad ""In a Nutshell"",
    for which they even (unsuccessfully) approached Nico to provide
    vocals.</p><p>
    Collins himself often wore his broken heart on his sleeve, but unlike
    other more diaristic or shoulder-slouched
    writers of his kind (Morrissey, Stuart Murdoch, Sufjan Stevens), he
    shrugged or laughed off his troubles.
    Collins' confessionals aren't a liturgy of woes, but of what he may
    feel
    is either sage advice or honest
    self-examination: ""Avoid eye contact at all costs,"" ""Only my dreams
    satisfy the real beat of my heart,""
    ""I'm not afraid of saying I'm close to tears."" Collins' mixture of indie woe and soul/disco sonically matched his desire ""to take
    the pleasure with the pain""-- he'd
    already had the pain in his life and songs, why not seek out the
    pleasure as well?</p><p>
    Those instincts peak on ""Consolation Prize"", where unrequited love and
    the faintest hope of romantic
    payoff are preferred to moving on, which would potentially mean
    actually
    <em>engaging</em> with romance
    and risking true heartbreak. He attempts the worst serenade this side
    of Joseph Cotton in <i>The
    Magnificent Ambersons</i> before almost euphorically admitting, ""I'll
    never
    be man enough for you.""
    Running yourself down never sounded so good.</p></div>"|6119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6119-the-glasgow-school/|9.3|Scott Plagenhoef

    dated by now, unless you're downloading Pearl Jam records. But it
    actually fits Sybris, a new band running contrary to several
    current trends and instead revitalizing the sensibility of
    1990s, singer-oriented alterna-rock.</p><p>
    
    Many modern indie bands, from Animal Collective to
    Architecture in Helsinki, revolve around genre-hopping eclecticism and
    fluctuating band-member duties-- a denaturing of the band-as-hierarchy
    aesthetic. Sybris hark back to the Smashing Pumpkins model, when
    bands were interested in making what we used to call the Unified
    Statement, not rummaging though through genres like a trunk full of
    costume jewelry, and when roles were more concrete-- less instrument
    swapping, more stability.</p><p>
    
    Here in the aughties, we've also seen the regression of the
    singer-as-driving-force, with more emphasis on whole-band harmonies,
    multiple singers, and quirky embellishments. Sybris's debut LP is more
    in the vein of bands that put a charismatic singer in front of strong
    yet unflashy musicians. The vocals and the music are always clearly
    demarcated-- while the latter is competent, powerful, and
    indispensable to the album's success, it maintains a uniform tone that
    doesn't distract from the centerpiece (vocalist Angela Mullenhour),
    even at its most thunderous. This singer-first, band-second
    sensibility, and the consistent temperament of the songs, is what
    makes Sybris resonate with Life Without Buildings (without the
    chirruping vocal tics) and Yeah Yeah Yeahs (without the artitude), two
    other band who updated this same model for the modern setting. </p><p>
    
    ""The Best Day in History in Ever"" opens with a percussive throb and
    fluid, concise guitar lead that makes one picture Karen O doing judo
    warm-ups with a mic stand. But this is where the two diverge: Yeah
    Yeah Yeahs might abruptly ramp the song up to a yowling blues
    splatter, but Mullenhour puts on her best Edie Brickell coo as her
    band rolls smoothly through understated dynamic shifts, building
    incrementally to a thrashing middle section, sinking through a quiet
    descent, then a upwelling to a mountainous, distortion-drenched
    re-crescendo. ""You're Only Confident in Your Insecurities"" opens with
    a fuck-all '90s guitar jangle, then edges crisply to a pop-metal
    stomp, the music and vocals intensifying as one. Even the coffee-shop
    strum of ""Blame It on the Baseball"" is made magnetic by
    Mullenhour's authoritative vocal turn, a blend of raw emotion and
    melodic control, and by the shimmering, stormy shoegaze it gradually
    melts into. </p><p>
    
    I like wildly-varied instrumentation and genre-hopping as much as the
    next musically savvy mid-20s dude. But the stuff can be exhausting,
    sending me scrambling for a Leonard Cohen comedown. Sybris's long
    songs, tonal contiguity, deliberate pacing, and infectious melodies
    are more than pleasant but less than bracing-- just right. They
    require no palliative counter-measure, and when the disc ends, there's
    no compulsion to rush to the changer-- why not just let it spin once
    more? </p></div>"|7819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7819-sybris/|8.0|Brian Howe

I like to bang
    but so
    does the bus; drop the snacks and dine me. Vitalic did it; Isolée did
    it sort
    of; I like that Schaffhaüser disc nobody talks about too; the boring
    middle
    section of the Juan MacLean record's brilliant; Daft Punk tried and
    failed
    unadmirably. Maybe albums are aren't your format or whatever--
    bullshit.</p><p>
    Catch-22 maybe? Am I that much of a bastard? Of course, but
    <i>Fraximal</i>'s plight is understandable. Kompakt's last few artist
    LPs have
    had trouble with mid-disc drag and some severe anxiety of influence,
    i.e.
    sounding too Kompakt, whatever that means. So we get albums with two or
    three
    good tracks and the rest personality- or statement-aspirant duds.
    Superpitcher,
    Mayer, Justus-- yeah, you guys, nice try, but what the fuck.</p><p>
    So here I am both relieved that Ferenc just made a solid, gimmickless
    10-track
    techno album that just wants to be solid and gimmickless and 10-track,
    and
    utterly disappointed that it's merely that. I had the same problem with
    Allien's newie; Ferenc make better tracks though.</p><p>
    Presenting: ""Diplodocus"", which shuffles 2k2 through an ambient X-Filed
    slush,
    the fieber kept asteer by bright railroad spike clicks and, if you
    listen
    closely enough, an actual melody. That the track starts off the whole
    album
    strikes me as defiant and anti-trendy-- this ain't no party, this ain't
    no
    disco-- and the next tracks have their own back-to-mine moments too:
    the raven
    strings of ""Sandia"", the sub-bass predilection of ""Neng""; the labby
    tabby rolls
    of closer ""Acidorro"".</p><p>
    If the duo didn't have a history of trendfucked hardcore-can, I wonder
    whether
    I'd take <i>Fraximal</i> for the dusty-futuro Nebuchadnezzar mothership
    it is,
    or just dusty and a little out of step, like a <i>Matrix</i> reference.
    The
    balance tips back and forth most during that middle run from ""Bocaseca
    1:0"" to
    ""France""-- through all is that warp-speed Basic Channel vibe I might
    have
    expected out of artists with a more fascist This Is The Real Shit
    agenda.
    Ferenc though are just two dudes stuck with a full-length deal, not one
    for
    five 12s; their music seems too good-hearted anyway and too merely
    good for
    a point, let alone world domination.</p></div>"|3342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3342-fraximal/|7.6|Nick Sylvester

As a solo act and with his bevy of talented collaborators, Stewart's sound has encompassed fractured strains of punk, funk, avant dub, free jazz, and dancehall, and has always been infused with his distinctive rabble-rousing politics and an ear uncannily pitched to the perpetual reinventions of street culture.</p><p>
    
    Throughout Stewart's career, he's remained a prescient figure, but his restless, thorny innovations have also likely contributed to the erratic nature of his discography. His recent history is pockmarked by extended stretches of inactivity, and many of his key titles-- including both of the Pop Group's proper studio albums-- are currently out of print in the U.S. So it's surely with this unruly back catalog in mind that Soul Jazz presents <em>Kiss the Future, a concise retrospective that features tasters from nearly every portion of Stewart's career, including several new or previously unreleased tracks.</em></p><p>
    
    Containing a mere 12 songs, <em>Kiss the Future is more of a strategic strike than a comprehensive introduction, as it represents whole periods of Stewart's career with only a track or two, and ignores some of his albums entirely. And though the set provides a tantalizing, remarkably unified glimpse at some of Stewart's most pioneering work, the collection feels so closely edited that one can't escape the notion that too many choice selections were left abandoned on the cutting room floor.</em></p><p>
    
    At their hot-wired best, the Pop Group delivered their experimental, roots reggae-inflected polemics with a barbed ferocity unmatched by few peers this side of the Birthday Party. <em>Kiss the Future includes three vintage 1979 Pop Group blasts (""We Are All Prostitutes"", ""She Is Beyond Good and Evil"", ""We Are Time"") that tidily anticipate the moves of contemporary post-punk revivalists from Liars to the Ponys. As with all of this collection's best material, these tracks appear to have aged not a day, which is accentuated by the album's non-chronological running order which places them immediately alongside new cuts like ""Radio Freedom"", Stewart's recent grimy, dubbed-out collaboration with Kevin ""The Bug"" Martin.</em></p><p>
    
    Other highlights include several pieces by Stewart's excellent post-Pop Group outfit the Maffia, which showcased the original Sugerhill Gang rhythm section of guitarist Skip McDonald, bassist Doug Wimbish, and drummer Keith LeBlanc. On tracks like ""High Ideals and Crazy Dreams"" or ""Hypnotized"" (presented in its 12"" version) the Maffia expel grainy, industrial smears of noise-funk, carrying the type of rugged sonic scars typically associated with a beloved, over-duped cassette tape. Best of all might be ""Jerusalem"", an expressionist, cut-up take on William Blake's traditional tune that features a spectral brass band periodically marching through in a narcotic haze. Like the bulk of <em>Kiss the Future, it's a track that somehow manages to sound simultaneously familiar yet revolutionary (not bad for a nearly 25-year-old recording) and serves to powerfully whet the appetite for the hopefully not-too-distant future when more of Stewart's keenly far-seeing works are once again easier to come by.</em></p></div>"|7822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7822-kiss-the-future/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

After the Darkness pecked away at metal-phobic listeners' prejudices, the subsequent carbon-copying of the Cure and Duran Duran decimated listeners' retro barriers, allowing anything sounding dustier than Dad's record collection to seep in. If right now the Killers are trashing Ritz-Carlton suites and spilling Port on their suit jackets, retro-cousins Diamond Nights at least must be leaving candy wrappers on the floor at Best Western.</p><p>
    
    Four of this EP's five offerings are pure frat party filth, cashing in on the reemergence of ""Jessie's Girl"" and ""867-5309/Jenny"" (did they ever go away?) on kegger playlists. ""Dirty Thief"" swipes the chords to ""Just What I Needed"" but forgets the hooks to match, leaving us with an unremarkable tale of heartbreak and rote soloing. ""Saturday Fantastic"" offers much of the same as the band pulls out its beefiest power chords and testosterone-soaked vocals. Amazing to think four years ago these guys would be tarred and feathered by both underground and mainstream critics, no?</p><p>
    
    Before totally denouncing them completely, check opener ""Destination Diamonds"". It's not exactly pushing the envelope, but it's also not jumping up and down screaming ""pick me!"" like so many outlandish revivalists. Frontman Morgan Phalen borrows the verse melody to ""Blinded By the Light"",  but fluffy guitar riffs and disarming falsetto puts the diffident, vulnerable spin on arena rock that the Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age so often miss.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately those slight gains are nullified by Diamond Nights' most vile error-- inexplicably feeling the need to prove they can use synthesizers. ""The Girl's Attractive"" reeks of lechery and tackiness, and the camp is residual on the fist-pumping faux-<em>Rocky</em> montage ""Buddies"". No one's being narrow-minded here, you simply can't just ape your parents' music, pass Go and collect your 200 bucks anymore (OK, I guess you get the money sometimes). <em>Once We Were Diamonds</em> unabashedly sports a caveat emptor, but that's exactly what drunk kids want to pay for when they stumble into Wal-Mart at 2 a.m. anyways, right?</p></div>"|2619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2619-once-we-were-diamonds-ep/|4.9|Adam Moerder

Despite a brief return as a pop noisenik/Kevin Shields fanboy with Sugar, the majority of Bob Mould's recorded work has done more to move past this legacy than actively further it. If you're a teenager, you're primed to have your head popped off by <em>Zen Arcade</em> or <em>New Day Rising</em>. If you're inching towards 30, then you're more likely to hear Mould's music introduce ""The Daily Show"" or segue into an NPR news story. And if you're Bob Mould, you're probably splitting time spinning records at DC-area clubs and getting ready to tour behind your supposedly guitar-heavy full-band album, <em>Body of Song.</em></p><p>
    If you're looking for ""Another Good Idea"" (or, God help you, ""Another Celebrated Summer""), then you're better served giving your ""Remaster the SST Catalog"" letter-writing campaign another go. If <em>Body of Song</em> is anything, it's a look back on the neglected portion of Mould's musical career. As Mould phrases it in ""Best Thing""-- ""This would be/ The sound of me/ Looking for some kind of closure.""</p><p>
    Of course, if you put an electric guitar in Bob Mould's hands, what gets put to tape will invariably be a rock-like substance. And having Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty in tow definitely helps. ""Always Tomorrow"" actually resembles the sort of slinky, groove-laden, bass-heavy stuff available on recent Fugazi albums, and the storms kicked up by ""Underneath Days"" and ""Beating Heart the Prize"" give Canty a chance to bang to his heart's content. However, when Mould opts to rock out the way he used to-- as on Sugar-lite stuff like ""I Am Vision, I Am Sound"" and ""Missing You""-- the results are less favorable. And, of course, this being a Bob Mould solo album, there are ballads that ably mix Mould's awkward nasal voice with impassioned strumming and sometimes clunky lyricism.</p><p>
    ""Days of Rain"" features a few clunkers-- ""If you make it clear/ Doubt will surely disappear""-- but it gets the job done, building gradually to a satisfying rock outro (with the requisite Mould guitar heroics). The disarming ""Gauze of Friendship"" is a more successful endeavor, with Mould keeping the music simple (acoustic guitar, drums, and some cello offered by DC-area musician Amy Domingues) and cutting the fat from his words-- ""He reminds you of a boy you dated once or twice/ Just about the same size /Just about the same eyes/ The only difference being the cadence of his voice.""</p><p>
    For the most part, <em>Body of Song</em> offers the expected mix of rock tracks and balladry that one would expect from a Bob Mould solo record. There is one notable exception. ""(Shine Your) Light Love Hope"" is, for all intents and purposes, a dance track. Atop layered guitars and Canty's fervent Saturday night fever, Mould makes like a vocodered disco diva, chanting the song's title in a dreamy, wispy voice. It's unlike anything else in Mould's rock catalog, more reminiscent of the unexpected deviations that peppered his Hüsker-era output (cf. ""99 Ways to Skin a Cat"", ""Reoccurring Dreams""). It's also one of the highlights of his post-Hüsker career, and I don't doubt that Mould agrees-- on the limited-edition bonus disc included with preorders of this album, there are two remixes of ""Light Love Hope"".</p><p>
    Longtime fans of the Flying V and the sonic boom could be outraged at Mould betraying his legacy with what they'll perceive as a techno version of ""I Was Made For Loving You"". But no doubt Mould would answer this indignant outrage by telling these so-called fans when and how to kiss his distortion pedals. Press kits and biographies will impress upon readers that Mould's lasting legacy is his part in founding and shaping the fast hard rules of the alternative rock nation, giving voice to a thousand grudging young would-be millionaires that have long since disappeared into cut-out bins. Nearly two decades removed from those iconic days, Mould has amassed a body of work that proves there's something to be said for running a slow and steady race.</p></div>"|5447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5447-body-of-song/|7.4|David Raposa

    Higgins appeared on stage for ""Thicker than a Smokey"", a
    Higgins track covered on Six Organs' last album, <i>School of the Flower</i>.
    I assumed Higgins and Ben Chasny would perform together, cross-generation style, but
    instead the Six Organs leader allowed the elder singer to go it alone. Still sporting
    a longish red beard with new-found gray, Higgins seemed nervous at
    first, but once he calmed down and hit a stride, the haunted beauty of
    the classic loner psych-folk song filled the space like a dusting of
    incense.</p><p>
    
    Chasny's acquiescence was a touching gesture, especially when
    considering that it's the Six Organs maestro, along with Drag City's
    Zach Cowie, who's largely responsible for the reissue of the lost 1973
    album, <em>Red Hash</em>, and Higgins' subsequent tour. (<i>School of the
    Flower</i> issued a missing person request in the liner notes,
    requesting that anyone with knowledge of Higgins' whereabouts please
    let Chasny know.) <em>Red Hash</em> was originally released on Higgins'
    Connecticut-based Nufusmoon Records. Around that time, he was busted for possession
    of marijuana and spent two years in prison. In his
    absence, the album sank into oblivion. Mastered from the
    original tapes with new photos and artwork from Higgins' archives as
    well as a lyric sheet and two bonus tracks, <em>Red Hash is now available to a
    wider audience.</em></p><p>
    
    It's been a good couple of years for once-lost folkies.
    Comparing Higgins to other formative players in the midst of rebirth,
    he's darker than Vashti Bunyan or Incredible String Band, less
    outer-realms and more melodic than Simon Finn. His work could, more or
    less, be compared to Skip Spence's <em>Oar dressed up like David Crosby.
    On <i>Red Hash</i>, his guitar and soulsick (but often uplifting) voice are
    accented with rich cello, piano, organ, mandolin, flute, and bass. The sounds are melancholy but never
    unaccessible: This is folk both your uncle and WFMU will (and do)
    love.</em></p><p>
    
    Coming first, ""Thicker Than a Smokey""'s the strongest composition, a perfect blend of wanderer sadness,
    transcendent vocals, jangling instrumentation, dour melodies, and a
    libretto that feels like a Beatnik ""Advice to the Graduate"". Like many
    of Higgins songs, ""Thicker"" deals with a journey.
    Beginning with the queries, ""What do you intend to do young man? Where
    do you intend to go?,"" he delves out homespun advice (""If you travel
    with a spider/ In your duffle bag/ With you good weather goes"") and
    personal anecdote (""It's often that I wish to leave myself/ Buy some
    fancy clothes..."") in a way that connotes something
    cyclical or unending.</p><p>
    
    Higgins' major themes are travel and lonesomeness. ""Telegraph Towers"" finds the protagonist ""sailin' for home"";
    only the blowing wind makes him feel like he's not alone. In ""I Can't
    Sleep at Night"" he's afraid of shut-eye because it might mean death
    (he smells it everywhere). The mournful ""Windy Child""'s downcast
    sing-along weds flute, cello, and Higgins' minor chords to ""You were
    the sun/ And I was the morning dew... / You were always bigger / you
    were always brighter than me."" The parlor fare of
    ""Looking For June"" has Higgins joined on vocals with upfront piano for a tale of a solo desert wanderer
    meeting with camels and the pope (check out the subtle, Eastern vibe).</p><p>
    
    Secondary lyrical fixations include animals, which often signify a
    lighthearted turn that under closer scrutiny isn't so joyful. There are
    plenty of birds (and the skies in which they fly), including a cuckoo
    in the track of the same name. Honing in
    on <em>Trout Mask Replica, ""Down on the Farm""'s comic protagonist milks a bull
    instead of a cow. There's also the gently humorous love ballad, ""Stable
    the Spuds"", but before getting too cozy, note the creepy piano, which
    trills like descending ice cubes.</em></p><p>
    
    The most beautiful work outside of ""Thicker than a Smokey"" is ""Unable
    to Fly"", which is traditional-sounding and pastoral, as if performed by
    Elliott Smith. (In parts, Higgins adopts a falsetto that
    sounds torn from <em>Either/Or</em>.) It retells a quest to reach the sun
    via an Icarus-type flight, but the hero's sent off in a wooden boat
    (carved by his father) to sail alone on the sea (as instructed by his
    mother). Before going, he turns in time to see her spread her wings
    ""to greet the sky so blue"" and fly away. Addressing a lover, he's
    bummed that know that knows where he's supposed to go, ""You no longer
    care to know."" He then flies, ""In the golden light of your stare.""</p><p>
<em>Red Hash</em> proper consists of 11 pieces and ends with the
    aforementioned (Revelations-inspired?) dream quest, ""Looking For
    June"". Unfortunately, as it often goes with these sorts of reissues,
    the two bonus tracks aren't as powerful as the others. ""Don't Ya
    Know"" is an early 80s home recording heavy on the blues and lines
    about drinking whisky and playing guitar and being a long-hair.
    (Remember the Five Man Electrical Band via Tesla? that kind of
    thing...) The more ambitious ""Last Great Sperm Whale""-- a 1975
    studio track with bluesy slide guitar and tinny drums-- tells the
    story of recently freed whale who goes on an oceanic tear until he's
    recaptured and killed. Likely coming on the heels of Higgins' release
    from prison, it's a fitting allegorical finale to the reissue, but
    stylistically it creates a disjunct from the original <i>Red Hash track
    list.</i></p><p>
    
    A more fitting end: Last weekend I was at a pot luck and the host put
    on <i>Red Hash. The first few strums of ""Thicker than a Smokey"" cast a
    lovely soporific feel over the room before I realized what it was.
    Commenting on it to my friend, he mentioned that from the pictures
    accompanying the music, it seems Higgins possesses a certain aura of
    calm (and there really is a tawny haze around his head in one of the
    pics). It reminded me of his Tonic performance. After Higgins
    completed his one-song set, Chasny told the crowd to buy Higgins a
    beer, but once he finished, he walked back to the bar, somehow ducked
    out of my sight, and blended silently back into the audience before I
    could attempt to fulfill the request.</i></p></div>"|4017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4017-red-hash/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

His latest, <i>Are You a Dreamer?, is a fine acoustic singer-songwriter album, but it contains nothing that cuts as close to the bone as Smith's more confessional work.</i></p><p>
    
    The tracklisting of Witmer's recent covers album, <i>Recovered</i>, better indicates his touchstones: Graham Nash, Jackson Browne, the Band, Big Star... Witmer plays some impossibly gentle country-folk, and <i>Are You a Dreamer?</i> provides more of the same, a far softer and more traditional record than those from Smith or potential points of comparison such as Damien Rice and Sufjan Stevens.</p><p>
    
    However, Stevens is all over this record, playing banjo, organ, even a recorder ensemble on ""Everything But Sleep"". He's just one of many contributors to <i>Dreamer, including Don and Karen Peris of the Innocence Mission and James McAllister on percussion, but it still sounds like a Dension Witmer solo record, just more fully realized. I hesitate to call it a collaborative record, because his contributors so keenly serve Witmer's fragile songs. </i></p><p>
    
    ""Little Flowers"" starts as basic singer-songwriter coffeehouse fare before Sufjan's banjo, breathy female backing vocals, and a quaint country beat make it into a memorable, but no less gentle, opener. ""Everything But Sleep"" features a recorder ensemble played by Stevens that's one of the album's boldest details, and ""Ringing of the Bell Tower"" matches shuffling drums with Witmer's rustic optimism. The title track makes best use of the contributors, weaving the barest female backing vocals, drums, and clean electric guitar into the song's emotional crests for a lavish but still restrained sound. </p><p>
    
    ""East From West"" plucks along without percussion, as does ""Castle and Cathedral"", a meditation on dreams and photographs. Dreams supposedly drive this album but are only hinted at in its lyrics. It's a uniformly solemn and understated record, and its songs blend together. It's difficult to remember just where one ends and one begins. Partly because Witmer never changes his vocal tone, the songs with the busier arrangements are the ones that stick.</p><p>
    
    It's the first record for Witmer with any kind of push behind it, and he sounds ready: cannily fleshing out his sound with some help from friends, but never losing sight of the style he's honed for years.</p></div>"|8796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8796-are-you-a-dreamer/|7.1|Jason Crock

    on
    the order of 7% of his output, I'm probably not qualified to make any
    pronouncements about Masami Akita's body of work. But I have heard
    enough to say that few of the early assumptions I had about his music
    are true. At first I figured that all his records must essentially
    sound
    the same, but it turned out he's probably more eclectic than your
    average artist. And while I initially had it in my head that noise
    music
    is foremost an expression of rage, Merzbow's work runs the emotional
    gamut. Much of the time, in fact, I would describe it as essentially
    neutral in terms of affect. As Dominique Leone pointed out in his
    review
    of <em>A Taste of Merzbow</em>, ""if any musical fabric binds [his records], it
    is
    that of total determination to assault the listener's senses."" Merzbow
    is essentially a psychedelic artist, attempting to create shifts in
    consciousness through extreme sound.</p><p>
    
    Using the Merzbow records I know as a barometer, <em>Merzbuddha is a
    comparatively stable and measured work. Three long tracks all bear the
    title ""Mantra"", and the recurring element through each is an ungodly
    deep and loud three-note bass pulse, around which is wrapped all sorts
    of whooshing and buzzing noises. I'd heard the whole record via ripped
    mp3s several times without grasping the full extent of this bottom end;
    once I finally played the CD on a stereo with a subwoofer as loud as
    seemed responsible in my apartment building, I developed a completely
    different understanding of the record. Akita has indicated that he was
    listening to a great deal of dub around the time he recorded
    </em><em>Merzbuddha,
    and if that's true this record is another example him taking the core
    elements of a beloved genre (he's toyed in the past with free jazz and
    prog samples) and smashing them to barely recognizable pieces in the
    Merzbow style.</em></p><p>
    
    Which is not to say that <em>Merzbuddha could ever have you feeling
    anywhere
    close to </em><em>Irie</em>, and god help the person who finds ""Mantra 1"" on the
    stereo with a head full of THC. Though there are few unpredictable
    blasts of noise, <em>Merzbuddha suggests more of a simmering paranoia, the
    ceaseless march of bass suggesting the B-movie monster that manages to
    keep pace with a fleeing victim despite moving almost in slow motion.
    There is a lot of steam and hiss throughout, like steam escaping from a
    coal-belching machine, and the crackles around the bass bring to mind a
    record stuck in a run-out groove.</em></p><p>
    
    Only in the last five minutes of this almost hour-long composition does
    Akita finally remove the governor, letting chaotic sheets of static and
    ear-splitting metallic scrapes overwhelm the carefully constructed
    rhythm. Given the title of the album and the series of three ""mantras,""
    and given the inside cover photo that shows Akita in a darkened temple
    kneeling in supplication, we're left to wonder: Is this final assault
    the sound of enlightenment? Don't know about that, but an hour of good
    Merzbow, which this is, certainly has a transformative effect.</p></div>"|5248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5248-merzbuddha/|6.8|Mark Richardson

    survivors from the late-80s Dischord boom
    that also produced Jawbox, Nation of Ulysses, and Shudder to Think,
    Lungfish has hardly varied its slow, ruminative style since inception.
    <em>Feral Hymns</em> isn't about to break the streak-- it's another
    album of measured, muscular first-wave emo and metaphysical
    doublespeak from these elder-statesman philosopher punks. The parallel
    between Lungfish's songs and their career is striking: Both seem like
    fixed points around which time ebbs and flows, like the tide around
    the pilings of pier. Their stark, minimal repetitions seemed
    fresh and dramatic in the varied, exploratory context of late-80s DC
    punk music. But in 2005, it's beginning to pale-- that same
    steadfast aesthetic feels more like a
    creative rut than a statement.</p><p>
    It's difficult to chastise Lungfish for repeating themselves, since
    repetition is their métier; nevertheless, <em>Feral Hymns</em>, while
    competent, even elegant in its precise intensity, feels tepid and
    bloodless-- Lungfish being Lungfish without making an effort to
    advance their craft. All the familiar elements-- the deliberate,
    stately percussion; the elongated, cyclical riffs; the snarled lyrical
    tautologies and abstruse involutions-- are all intact. ""All Creation
    Bows"" lays abstractions like ""Every surface is reflecting/ Every line
    is intersecting"" into a deep down-tempo groove, and the triumphant
    unrolling motion of ""You Are the War"" is matched by its
    mythological pronouncements: ""You are the winged wrist of
    the sun disk/ You are the first child of ancient slime."" But there's
    nothing here to urge less fervent fans away from their more energetic
    and nostalgically charged back catalog.</p><p>
    Lungfish is about as far from dancepunk as you can get, yet the core
    structure of dance music is a good comparison for understanding how
    they arrive at their <em>sui generis</em> style. Dancepunk usually
    appropriates the trappings of dance music-- shuffle beats, robotic
    bass, crisp tempo-changes and dynamic shifts-- and arrays them in
    serial, song-oriented structures. But what really identifies dance
    music as such is its structural development: More vertical than
    lateral, achieved through variations and amplifications on a theme,
    not concatenated linear progression. This is exactly what Lungfish
    does with punk music, which is particularly apparent on instrumental
    tracks like ""Picture Music"". They stretch the basic elements of punk
    into long, tense arcs, where central themes are tweaked and coaxed
    through subtle variations. The idea is an interesting one, but even
    the most unique ideas have a limited shelf-life, and on <em>Feral
    Hymns</em>, one gets the sense that it's played out its possibilities.
    It's common to complain of one band sounding too much like another,
    but Lungfish has fallen into a rarer trap-- they've begun to sound too
    much like themselves. </p></div>"|4927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4927-feral-hymns/|5.8|Brian Howe

The band's excellent <i>Orgelplaneten featured the usual roller-rink organ melodies and surf-rock inspired drumming, alongside spacier Moog excursions that somehow never quite sounded like the arcane, gnome hymns you might expect given their proximity to fellow Swedish legend Bo Hansson's classic 1973 <em>Lord of the Rings</em> LP (which you should probably download right now). In fact, Sagor and Swing produced some of the best melodies and mellowest moods this side of Cluster, and I'd mourn their passing a lot more if organist Eric Malmberg hadn't just released his first solo disc, <em>Den Gåtfulla Människan</em> (or ""The Enigmatic Man"").</i></p><p>
    Malmberg was responsible for the melodic half of Sagor and Swing's charm, writing most of the music and performing almost all of it via his trusty Hammond. For some reason, bands stopped playing this instrument despite a whole bunch of cool sound effects and rhythm presets that put most modern synthesizers to shame in terms of warm ambience, and absolutely destroy whole families of Casio sound banks. <i>Den Gåtfulla Människan is a true solo record, eschewing drums or any other sound besides Malmberg's Hammond, but if anti-gravity mood music is your thing, you'll hardly notice the Spartan setup. Melodies ring, echo, and decay like reflections of ice crystals around Saturn; clumpy little drum patterns that sound piped in from <em>Zuckerzeit</em> gallop like analog unicorns under layers of finely aged space dust, the kind for which Tim Gane would probably sell his soul. Like countrymen Dungen, Malmberg's music could just as easily have been recorded 35 years ago as today, and like them, he manages to avoid the pitfalls of mining the past by being a perfectionist: this kind of music doesn't really get much better.</i></p><p>
    The opener ""Det H\x9Agre Medvetandet"" (or ""The Higher Awareness""-- even translated, some of this doesn't really, er, translate, which I guess explains a lot of Abba lyrics) wastes no time in establishing the tone of the record, with a spectral glissando and reverberated triplet-motifs, all of which set up a solemn, almost hymnal melody. The optimistic, misty-eyed phrases sound like the first thing I'd want to hear in the morning, were I waking up in Rivendell. That's right. And Malmberg doesn't let up, as each song segues into the next; out of this mystical den flow the minor key arpeggios of ""Undermedvetandet"", sounding like I've been transported from an elfin parlor to the lunar surface. ""Jaget"" introduces a soft, pitter-patter bossa-beat and a melancholy tune that is vaguely reminiscent of the break in ""A Whiter Shade of Pale""-- though given the organ sounds, that's not very surprising. More likely, this is straight out of Scandinavian folk music, which is often faintly regal, yet colored gray. It's pretty.</p><p>
    ""Språk och Tankestrukturer"" features more arpeggios, though faster this time, and a little similar to what Philip Glass used to do before someone convinced him symphonies and soundtracks were cooler than all night concerts in New York lofts. And again, the melodies keep the piece from floating into the stratosphere; Malmberg is always able to ground his music with things you can hum, even as you might feel you're levitating. The closer ""Människan och Evigheten"" does actually drift out to the celestial sea, but not before bathing itself in waves of milk via the drone of overdubbed organs and distant piano figures. True, <em>Den Gåtfulla Människan</em> is drenched in the trippy atmospheres of true blue space music and prog, but it's hardly pretentious or bellowing. Rather, this is the kind of thing that gives good names to organists and gnomes alike.</p></div>"|5660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5660-den-gatfulla-manniskan/|8.0|Dominique Leone

I was a Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister fan but somehow didn't get around to hearing Tosca's 1997 debut <em>Opera</em> until early '99. Opera's opener ""Fuck Dub Part 1 + 2"" immediately struck me as the best thing K or D had ever released, and even now I can't think of another track that so successfully weds the slow-burn funk rhythms of ""golden age"" hip-hop with the disorienting production tricks of dub. ""Fuck Dub"" to me was the ultimate expression of the weeded-out aesthetic those in the Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister orbit cultivated (hydroponically, of course).</p><p>
    
    That the rest of the album was a mess-- basically a couple of great singles interspersed with an amalgamation of half-baked grooves, ambient drones, and crude recordings of old black guys talking the kind of jive German DJs find cool-- only added to my enjoyment. This sloppy handling of talent went down easy for a guy who stood ready to defend the genius of <em>Mark's Keyboard Repair</em>.</p><p>
    
    Tosca cleaned up right quick, though. <em>Suzuki</em> (2000) polished the rough edges of the debut and was recognized as the perfect accompaniment to the turn-of-the-millennium retail experience. No Gap manager was ever fired for throwing <em>Suzuki</em> on the store PA, which shouldn't take away from the fact that Tosca does crisp, catchy downtempo better than almost anybody (it's all in the bassline, you see). 2003's <em>Dehli9</em> mixed things up a little by introducing samba and vocals but it looked as though the loose, weird Tosca of the first album was probably gone forever.</p><p>
    
    Now we have the fourth album. There's not much to report on the weird/novelty front, but Tosca remains in fine form. It's uncanny how just how much mileage these guys get from small, easy gestures, like the simple bass riff that drives the opening head-nodder ""Rondo Acapricio"". On the one hand it sounds borrowed, something you've heard a million times before in some overplayed rare groove classic. But it's also a signature sound, identifiable as Tosca and relentlessly catchy. Throughout the record Tosca employ guest stars of various styles and tongues (more than half the tracks have vocals) but it all fits easily into their highly refined world.</p><p>
    
    Egypt-born Parisian Samia Farah sassily lilts her way through the electro-cocktail number ""Heidi Bruehl"", Chris Eckman from The Walkabouts evokes the glamorous high-contrast noir of Chris Isaak as he half-sings on ""John Lee Huber"", and ""Damentag"" is perfectly frothy glitter disco. The bass throughout is astonishingly deep and clear, and for the first time in my reviewing career I feel compelled to give a shout-out to the mastering engineer.</p><p>
    
    Not all the songs work. ""The Big Sleep"" with its vibrato guitars and horns has a neo-roadhouse vibe but the vocals by Austrian rocker Graf Hadik sound like tossed-off space filler. Still, the good far outweighs the bad. <i>J.A.C. is ultimately a simple record covering well-worn territory that is no less engaging for its familiarity. While it sadly does not return to the unpredictability and high highs of <em>Opera</em>, this is probably the best thing Tosca has released otherwise. If you're the type of person who values things like consistency and high production values this is the Tosca record to get.</i></p></div>"|8291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8291-jac/|7.0|Mark Richardson

For starters, both country and reggae build on outlaw imagery and class issues, making heroes of rebels and outsiders, and the sunny island rhythms have the potential to counterbalance the dark gospel sobriety of many of Nelson's songs. Furthermore, Nelson's reputation for cannabis consumption, while not a pervasive trend in conservative country music, suggests that maybe music wasn't the primary motivation for recording in Jamaica. It's an act of cool wit that <i>Countryman prominently features a marijuana leaf on the album cover-- although many chain stores are stocking the tamer version, which features a palm tree.</i></p><p>
    
    The idea for <em>Countryman</em> is one that Nelson has been entertaining for about a decade: He began recording tracks for it in 1995 when he signed to Island, but the album was shelved during the late-90s turmoil of label buyouts and mergers. Now Nelson's new label, Lost Highway Records, is finally showing it the light of day. However, what's intriguing in concept doesn't hold up very well on <i>Countryman. The album mixes new versions of old songs like ""Darkness on the Face of the Earth"" and ""One in a Row"" with a few covers, most notably Johnny Cash's ""Worried Man"" (here a duet with Toots Hibbert) and Jimmy Cliff's ""The Harder They Come"" and ""Sitting in Limbo"". The 72-year-old's feisty musical curiosity is certainly admirable, and the results prove more listenable than Nelson's recent genre outing <em>Milk Cow Blues</em>, but these songs generally sound half-baked.</i></p><p>
    
    Much of the blame can be placed on producer Don Was, who dresses the songs in garishly percolating rhythms that seem to have no connection to Nelson's laidback vocals. Nelson has trained his nylon-string guitar and his tried-and-true touring band to follow his signature phrasing, which is patient and unfussy as it skirts the beat. But Was's generic rhythms keep chugging along irrespective of Nelson's vocals, so that the two elements sound disjointed. As a result, songs like ""Do You Mind Too Much If I Don't Understand"" and ""You Left Me a Long, Long Time Ago"" have the awkward musical synthesis of an amateur mash-up. ""I've Just Destroyed the World"" and ""Darkness on the Face of the Earth"", in particular, suffer unflattering comparisons to better versions on the more or less contemporaneously recorded <i>Teatro; coming off the success of Emmylou Harris's </i><i>Wrecking Ball, producer Daniel Lanois showed a much more intuitive understanding of Nelson's limitations and worked the songs accordingly. While it's certainly ambitious and even occasionally playful, <em>Countryman</em> displays no such musical comprehension; it's usually just a shambles, and not even an interesting one at that.</i></p><p>
    
    There is, however, one song that makes this excursion more or less worthwhile. Nelson's cover of ""The Harder They Come"" proves all the more adventurous for sounding more like Nelson than like Jimmy Cliff. Was keeps the percussion to a minimum-- mainly it's just wood blocks and a gently struck tom-- which leaves more room for Mickey Raphael's harmonica, Robby Turner's dobro, and elegant backing vocals from Toots Hibbert's daughter Lieba Thomas and Jamaican singer Pam Hall. Nelson seems perfectly at home in this mellower setting, confidently translating Cliff's urban rebel philosophy into a desert drifter's credo. ""The Harder They Come"" is pure outlaw reggae, fulfilling the album's crazy-brilliant promise to meld island rhythms with plains melodies. However, even as it provides the template for a remarkable and powerful reggae record, it also reinforces how disappointingly this one turned out.</p></div>"|5906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5906-countryman/|3.8|Stephen  M.

    Good God the juvenilia! I was 14 when I first heard ""Detachable Penis,"" and I found it catchy and hilarious enough that my friend Dave and I choreographed a whole geeky ""interpretive"" dance to go with it, which we performed backstage in our high school auditorium for a selection of friends. Later that week, on a late-night bus ride, I split a pair of earbuds with a girl from our audience, listening to the left channel of ""Freak Me"" and touching actual boobs for the first time. This box puts the two tracks together because it thinks it knows me. It can't explain how I managed to touch this girl's boobs even after she'd seen me doing geeky interpretive dances, but whatever: I shouldn't have been touching those particular boobs anyway, and now, whenever I hear Silk's overheated ""wanna lick up you up and down"" come-ons (most recently from a singing homeless guy), I get all sorts of <em>Portnoy's Complaint</em> issues going.</p><p>
    
    Disc 2 track 17: Spin Doctors, ""Little Miss Can't Be Wrong""<br/>
    Disc 2 track 18: dada, ""Dizz Knee Land""</p><p>
    
    You think it's totally self-indulgent of me to share my banal high-school memories at the top of this review? Then don't think about buying this box set. <em>Whatever</em> is seven discs and over a hundred dollars' worth of random nostalgia and unflinching faith in the disposable income of formerly middle-class suburban alt-rock kids now around their late twenties. The track selection is specifically designed to let people in this demographic spend 15 minutes going ""oh shit, I remember...and holy shit, lookit, that one video, right...I am Cornholio I need TP for my bunghole...holy fuck ... no MC 900 Foot Jesus?"" All for the last decade during which people relied on ganky old cassette dubs, and therefore don't have ganky old external hard drives to crack open when they want to get Proustian about 4 Non Blondes.</p><p>
    
    Disc 3 track 12: Green Jelly, ""Three Little Pigs""<br/>
    Disc 3 track 13: Dinosaur Jr., ""Start Choppin""</p><p>
    
    So what do you want to do: Bask in the warm-fuzzy vibe of shared pop-cultural history or be crushed by the thought that your suburban alt-rock song-memories, and maybe even some of the stories that go with them, are shared by just as massive a cohort as you-- being a child of the nineties and therefore wanting to be ""special""-- always feared? And so long as you're examining your emotions, check this out: How many of the tracks you're excited to see here did you actively despise when they were on your teenage radio? Not yet 30 and already so wistful! Pop culture races along, and here is the ambient sound of your teenage years; I have Big Head Todd like a sepia snapshot of me growing up in Colorado and hating Big Head Todd; do we just buy this now and put it in storage for when we retire?</p><p>
    
    Disc 5 track 14: Better than Ezra, ""Good""<br/>
    Disc 5 track 15: Blues Traveler, ""Run-Around""</p><p>
    
    Well no, because Rhino couldn't possibly understand just how special you are, and they're cheating on you with everyone in your age group. The bulk of this set consists of standards and one-hit non-wonders from the mid-nineties flare-of up alternative rock radio, and maybe if you pared that segment down to a couple of discs it'd be a half-decent idea: There's nothing wrong with getting a kick out of hearing Green Jelly or Marcy Playground one last time, but there's certainly something wrong with spending a hundred bucks to do it. Same goes for the subset of perfectly fine, memorable alt-rock singles scattered around, especially in Time-Life infomercial terms: Looking for a way to avoid the expense and headache of tracking down Helmet, Sugar, Juliana Hatfield, and Ash albums? Except: If that's your angle, how much do you really need some C+C Music Factory and Right Said Fred hanging out on the other five discs? How much do you need weirdly placed tracks by Pavement, My Bloody Valentine, and Stereolab, tracks from albums fans mostly bought and still listen to? Is this a recap of alt-rock memories or a <em>Now That's What I Called the Nineties</em> hits compilation or what? By whose estimation, exactly, do quasi-riot-grrrls and Seattle rockers form <em>this</em> much of the nineties history? And why does this listing seem to swing back and forth between ""remember the theme from <em>Friends</em>"" kitsch-stalgia and seemingly trying to tell us that some of these tracks are actually good and important?</p><p>
    
    Disc 6 track 11: Jewel, ""Who Will Save Your Soul""<br/>
    Disc 6 track 12: Primitive Radio Gods, ""Can You Believe Our Label was Willing to Promote a Song with a Long Stupid Title about a Phone Booth?""</p><p>
    
    The only thread that really works, in fact, is the carefully selected line of Genuine Chart Hits that Suburban White People Liked then Forgot About. Rhino just happens to assume that somewhere around 1993 you bought a bunch of flannel shirts or striped tights and threw away whichever of your middle-school mix tapes contained ""Walking in Memphis"" and ""Silent Lucidity,"" and after that you thought you were much too cool to buy anything by Des'ree or Deep Blue Something-- and then somehow, by decade's end, you were back to being cool with Shawn Mullins. See? Rhino doesn't know you at all. But you're special to me, and at least if they'd been a little more consistent about the pop streak, we could be listening to Natalie Imbruglia's ""Torn"" right now. </p><p>
    
    Disc 3 track 5: Wreckx-N-Effect, ""Rump Shaker""<br/>
    Disc 3 track 6: Snow, ""Informer""</p><p>
    
    Speaking of pop: A quick scan over the track listing might give you the mistaken impression that Rhino have made a half-hearted attempt to get some hip-hop, r&amp;b;, and dance music on here. Turns out there's no ""half"" going on. They've just managed to cull an exact, scientific selection of the particular hip-hop, r&amp;b;, and dance hits that their alt-rock demographic-- hell, their alt-rock demographic's <em>parents</em>-- either liked or can't help remembering. ""Can't Touch This"" is the first track on the first disc, followed by plenty of EMF and Jesus Jones and other things that struck me as sounding ""cool"" and ""different"" on the radio on the way to soccer practice, where-- oh memory!-- a guy named Steve would later sell me all his old Cure and Morrissey albums, because he was getting into Van Halen and trying to pick up chicks. Whatever: from there on it's all En Vogue and Sir Mix-a-Lot and ""O.P.P."" and other things that even people in comas would remember, plus such legends of hip-hop's Golden Age as Kriss Kross, plus stuff like Canadian toaster Snow (whose ""Informer"" video was so popular that MTV put the words and a bouncing ball on screen), jock favorite ""Jump Around"" (by the proud Irish rappers of House of Pain), and, cleverly, DAS EFX, filling the spot you'd think would be reserved for Digable Planets or Arrested Development. Whoomp, there you are, and no Onyx, either: You can get nostalgic for both the alt-rock hits you loved and a few of the pop hits you pretended not to! Plus Boyz II Men.</p><p>
    
    Disc 1 track 2: Sinead O'Connor, ""Nothing Compares 2 U""<br/>
    Disc 1 track 3: Michael Penn, ""No Myth""</p><p>
    
    Whatever. I am nothing if not a nostalgist; I have associations for miles and stories to tell; I spent this exact decade in high school and college and the mere track listing of this box makes me want to hunt down old friends. Here is a bunch of stuff I remember, and yet it's not even worth one hundred dollars. Good thing we no longer live in that Time-Life world, that pre-mp3 world where you couldn't possibly track down all these memorable hits; give yourself an afternoon and a copy of iTunes, and you can make your nineties however you like, for memory or for quality or for fun. If all else fails, didn't they just put out <em>My So-Called Life</em> and the first season of <em>The Real World</em> on DVD?</p></div>"|1971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1971-whatever-the-90s-box-set/|4.2|Nitsuh Abebe

    new avenues, with more ideas in five songs than the band had over
    the rest of their career. Two of the songs from that EP are re-recorded
    here, the opening title track and ""We're Not Gonna Crack""-- a sign that Longwave are
    either self-doubting perfectionists or short on ideas.</p><p>
<em>There's a Fire</em> is an ambitious album-- the kind that wants to be
    played end-to-end and begs repeated listens to sink in-- but Longwave
    have a small bag of tricks. The best moments are when they prove what
    they're already capable of: decent melodies with prominent rhythms and
    a hint of atmosphere. ""River (Depot Song)"" takes
    this blueprint and adds a soft falsetto moment between its
    effect-laden verses; the result is a darker, more dynamic counterpoint to their moderate hit ""Everywhere You Turn"".</p><p>
    
    Frontman Steven Schlitz's voice is limited in range and
    expressiveness, and he has trouble with U2-aping arena-aiming moments, such as
    the verses of ""There's a Fire"". Moreover, the weak vocals call further attention to
    the trite lyrics on songs like the maudlin piano-driven ""The Flood"" or
    the poppy ""Tell Me I'm Wrong"". Schlitz almost pulls off ""Heart Attack""
    with straightforward charm, but when the big guitars come in on the second
    verse, it becomes a sappy ballad. ""Underworld"" takes an impression of Thom Yorke's falsetto over acoustic
    plucking and contrasts it with a theme played on bowed, distorted
    strings. It almost works, but when the same theme reappears in between the
    maracas-and-angst of another Radiohead-lite moment, ""Down in Here"", it
    starts to seem like a rope tossed to a song that's going nowhere.</p><p>
    
    Longwave are taking big steps, but not in any new directions. The band still wants to rub shoulders with the its moody English influences,
    but dabbling in styles you're ill-equipped for, weaving unnecessarily recurring
    themes into the songs, or piling on incidental effects-pedal sounds for
    atmosphere aren't going to inherently elevate your music.</p></div>"|4847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4847-theres-a-fire/|5.6|Jason Crock

Over a gently strummed guitar and gently tapped triangle, the former Speedwell member arcs his whispery voice across a plaintive melody, enunciating higher notes for a lyrical phrase before descending again to a more comfortable range. Singing just above his natural level, Bragg crafts the tune and the performance for maximum poignancy. It's the work of a bright student: a little self-conscious and overeager, but nevertheless affecting.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, the lyrics on ""Work and Winter"" are particularly Gibbardesque: ""Smiling as I felt your breathing align/ In alliance with mine."" It would be a little rash to dismiss Bragg and his Terminals as just another troupe of pop-sensitive, heart-on-sleeve folkies. Admittedly, most of <em>Vol. 1</em> draws heavily from obvious sources, and most of the ideas here will be familiar to anyone who's heard Nick Drake, Death Cab for Cutie, or the New Year. And yes, the album's aesthetic of failure-- its tendency toward extreme self-reckoning-- derives from Smith's canon of introverted and expressive songs. However, despite these influences and even despite its Decemberistical album art, <em>Vol. 1</em> transcends any accusation of imitation: These 11 tracks have their own high stakes and dire consequences and seem as specific to Bragg himself as Smith's were to him, as Gibbard's are to him.</p><p>
    
    Instead of mining Smith's sense of self-compromise or entertaining the DCFC frontman's romantic whimsy, Bragg writes lyrics that are more plainspoken and austere in their jadedness. He's wary of relationships on the bare-bones ""Early Sign"", surprised that he can be guardedly hopeful on ""Carolina"", and, over uncorrected guitar flubs, sweetly reminiscent on ""Seventeen"". All of this introspection is couched in music that is at once intimate yet expansive, concise yet darkly atmospheric, understated yet occasionally powerful. Bragg sings in a soft voice, carefully enunciating his syllables as if uncertain he'll be understood. Only when he alters his voice for ""Waltz No. 1"" does the album falter, but elsewhere his risks pay off. Bragg spends half of the seven-and-a-half-minute ""I Won't Let You Down"" half-humming the short melody over and over, stoically building to something uncertain yet ineluctable. </p><p>
    
    That ""I Won't Let You Down"" sounds so confident and immediate is not just to Bragg's credit, but also to the credit of the Terminals, who prevent <em>Vol. 1</em> from descending gravitationally into dreariness. Jonathan Roth's drums propel the melodies and anchor Bragg to the world, while Elizabeth Olson's cello adds tremulous gravity to tracks like the short ""Before the Storm"" and ""Bitter at Best"". But it's Brian Minter who adds most to the band's sound and helps make it distinct from their forebears. His piano makes a perfect foil for Bragg's mechanistic guitar rhythms on the propulsive closer, ""Shattering"", and his ""Vibraphonic Devices"" evoke a noir chiaroscuro on the dark ""My Own Worst Enemy"". Bragg and the Terminals may not have pioneered their sound, but they sound perfectly at home all the same.</p></div>"|1167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1167-vol-1/|7.5|Stephen M. Deusner

    understands that the difference between simple and simple-headed is,
    quite literally, wit. Like his aforementioned countryfolk, the
    longtime Australian musician has a knack for quirky tunefulness,
    good-naturedly ambitious rhymes and tingly everyday details, shared
    over shopworn guitars and embellished with piano, violin or the
    occasional toy instrument. For his second solo album, <em>Little
    Chills</em>,  Hanlon soft-focuses on another set of unembarrassed odes
    to simple pleasures, this time with knob-twiddling from Calexico
    producer Craig Schumacher.</p><p>
    Hanlon revels in the mundane with the childish exuberance of Jonathan
    Richman. On one of the album's punkier tracks, Hanlon laments the
    dearth of songs about his favorite indoor sport: ""Can't some DJ play a
    squash song in their bracket?"" he asks. He indulges in Lucksmithian
    weather puns on ""Winter Takes Fall"", starting the day in shorts but
    ""having second thoughts"" (the accent makes the rhyme, natch). He
    visits every train station in town. He loves vinyl-shopping so much he
    almost spoils the album with cliché-- ""your life's a film, who writes
    the score?""-- before redeeming himself with a panoptic closing
    incantation, ""The record stays still/ While the world revolves around
    it.""</p><p>
    The goosebumps of real-life romance have been a Hanlon theme dating
    back to dizzy, banjo-laden 2000 hit ""Falling Aeroplanes"". It's been 21
    years since Billy Bragg released ""A New England"", but Hanlon's love
    songs still echo his former tourmate's cleverness, if not his
    righteous indignation. On ""A to Z"", the clear choice for first single,
    Hanlon asks his sweetie to read him all the names in the phone book--
    ""both Christian and sur-""-- and sing ""the entire Beatles
    <em>Anthology</em>/ From 'All My Loving' to 'Yellow Submarine'"". Any
    quibbles over his exclusion of John Lennon's Brian Epstein portrait
    (plus, bloody ""Yesterday""!) would miss the point. Then ""I Wish That I
    Was Beautiful for You"" averts its own potential cheesiness with vivid
    specificity: ""It looked as though the highway wore eyeliner,"" Hanlon
    murmurs.</p><p>
    For all his aw-shucks regular-guyness, though, it's Hanlon's oddities
    that-- as he himself might rhyme-- make his quiddity. It's the thrash
    coda of heavy-metal T-shirt memento ""Brooklyn Bridge"", the perversely
    slow and distant opener ""Wrong Turn"", the ""half a dozen eggplants/ Or
    six aubergines"". It's the self-abbreviating party ruckus in ""The
    Unmade Bed"", followed by Hanlon's simple, witty mission statement:
    ""These are my principles/ If you don't like them I've got others/
    This is my opinion/ If you don't agree, I've got big brothers.""</p></div>"|4015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4015-little-chills/|7.2|Marc Hogan

    teens to keep them occupied under the guise of learning more about their 
    religion. When I was forced to attend, I spent my own time there
    faking seizures and trying to talk to girls. Such was the 
    leniency of the Presbyterian Church.</p><p>
    
    Maybe the term means something different in Youth Group's home country 
    of Australia, as 
    the band are neither that fun nor that painful (respectively). They 
    aren't that anything, really. The best thing I can say about Youth Group 
    is that if there's a difference between merely average and
    painfully mediocre, <i>Skeleton Jar</i> is on the upswing of that 
    curve.</p><p>
    
    Singer Toby Martins' voice is reminiscent of James' Tim Booth, expressive but 
    without quite the same range or control. Couple his mannered delivery 
    with basic, sing-song melodies, and add them to predictable progressions 
    and dull rhythms, and there isn't much about <em>Skeleton Jar</em> to 
    recommend. The album is dominated by guitars playing droning arpeggios in 
    tick-tock rhythms, cranking up the distortion just as the chorus 
    approaches like a tired employee punching in for work.</p><p>
    
    Songs like ""See-Saw"" appropriate slow indie pop jangle much the way 
    Death Cab for Cutie once did, though it becomes a limp power ballad by the 
    chorus. ""Baby Body"" is a step in the right direction, at least compared 
    to the rest of the record. Beginning with acoustic plucking and the 
    soft pounding of the bass drum, it shifts dynamics and adds some spirit to 
    their performance for the second verse. However, hit the pause button 
    before then, and you could probably sing the simple chorus melody before 
    you even hear it. While they avoid slipping into cringing emo, they 
    could take a moment or two to actually emote, as they do on the album's 
    closer, ""Piece of Wood"". <em>Skeleton Jar</em> gives a clear blueprint of 
    what the band wants to sound like, but adds nothing unexpected to the 
    formula.</p><p>
    
    The album's biggest surprise is that it was released by Epitaph, who 
    went so far as to slap a quote from Death Cab guitarist and producer 
    Chris Walla on the album's front sticker. To whit: Skeleton Jar is ""sweet 
    and dear in a world stolen by cynics""; ""cynics"" likely encompassing 
    critics trying to review the album honestly, and also that, ""If you don't 
    love them, your heart is dead."" Could you please put a more original 
    record in my heart's coffin before you nail it shut and push it out to sea? 
    Thanks, Chris.</p></div>"|8915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8915-skeleton-jar/|5.1|Jason Crock

So original, in
    fact, that his fans overlook his flaws, namely that he's
    an average emcee and his lyrics can be terrible. For over a decade the
    Nova Scotia native (née Richard Terfry) has been storytelling in verse
    over twanged-out beats. This stylistic donnybrook-- one of hip-hop's
    most distinctive-- has been met with equal parts approbation and
    bafflement. To some, he's the Johnny Cash of hip-hop; to others, a
    kitsch novelty act. (He's neither.) Early Buck albums had all the
    professionalism of a late-night weed experiment, but
    Terfry is growin' up and it shows. On career
    retrospective/archaeological dig <i>This Right Here Is Buck 65, released
    in January, lyrics were revised and songs re-recorded. Charmers like
    ""my cock is so big and the end of it glistens"" (from ""The Centaur"")
    became ""my clock is so clean and the hour-hand is missing.""</i></p><p>
    Does vocal repentance make Buck's stuff more palatable? Not really,
    but it does enable us to take the emcee (slightly) more seriously.
    <em>Secret House Against the World</em>, Buck's first album of entirely new
    material since 2003's <i>Talkin' Honky Blues, switch hits: The beats now
    belie the seriousness of the lyrics, if anything. Sometimes moods meet
    up and the result is moving: Pedal steel (always sad), marimba, and a
    narcotically lugubrious acoustic guitar underpin Buck's gruff
    lamentations on ""The Suffering Machine"". But on balance he seems out
    to prove his sadness runs deeper than even music can convey. And damn,
    his music can be some sad-sack shit.</i></p><p>
    The droopiest numbers are thankfully spaced out, in addition to being
    somewhat spaced-out. ""Corrugated Tin Facade"" opines, ""nothing's more
    beautiful than a woman's tears,"" over a burbling synth spread that
    might get Jóhann Jóhannsson to rap. Like ""Surrender to Strangeness"",
    which pits elder statesman cello against an electronic beat, the song
    would be more beautiful without Buck's lyrics, but not necessarily
    better.</p><p>
    It's refreshing to hear Buck deliver over a non-dirgeful backdrop. The
    sadder beats amplify his flaws and push his style over the top, making
    his funereal drawl seem farcical. On ""Blood of a Young Wolf"" he's
    unpleasantly robotic, evoking black-on-the-inside mallcore frontmen
    more than any American folk icon. It's possible dude's voice
    has dropped a couple semitones since recording his first EP in 1992,
    but c'mon. I don't think even Beck's gravelly monotone has ever
    sounded as silly as his consonant peer's on ""Kennedy Killed the Hat"".
    The less overtly downtrodden backings offer more proper sympathy. ""Le
    65isme"", which features a stripped-down beat of live drum kit, martial
    bass and a few snappy guitar notes, fares much better. The mood is
    dark (of course) but hardly sentimental. Buck gives the refrain
    (""sex... cinema... politique"") a blunt, Shatner-esque reading.</p><p>
    In the past Buck seemed unsure of how to spit over his most
    country-flavored beats; here he's completely at ease. ""The Suffering
    Machine"" sounds suspiciously like ""Phil""-- one of three new cuts on
    This Right Here-- but this time Buck lets the words come slowly,
    making room for the scruffily beautiful music. Similarly poised is
    ""Drunk Without Driving"", which presents a techier variant on more
    straight-strutting twang jobs like opener ""Roughhouse Blues"".</p><p>
    In underground hip-hop, whose artists and fans bitch incessantly about
    authenticity, it's awesome that one of the artists with the most cred
    is a white guy from Nova Scotia who wears a trucker hat (check the
    website photos). Seven albums into his career, Richard Terfry has
    stayed as distinctive, and consistent, as anyone. Now he finally seems
    to be making a home of his hodgepodge.</p></div>"|1070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1070-secret-house-against-the-world/|6.8|Sam Ubl

That's sort of how Alan Braxe operates, I guess. Despite making some of the most robust and radiant disco-house of the last decade-- Gallic or otherwise-- he's never seemed to be one for fanfare. In the insular world of French house, he's like a mid-altitude cruiser to Daft Punk's twirling tandem airshow; dependable and always moving, but hardly the type to write his name in the sky.</p><p>
    So, some background: Since debuting on Thomas Bangalter's seminal Roulé imprint in 1997, Braxe (real name: Alan Queme) has casually tossed off a series of 12s that hit in the same league as Daft Punk's concurrent singles. But with the possible exception of last year's cokey synth anthem ""Rubicon"" and the definite exception of his co-sign on 1998's ""Music Sounds Better With You"", chances are you won't recognize anything on <em>The Upper Cuts</em>. Even those who do might be caught a bit off guard, because it's easy to lose sight of Braxe's considerable talent when he's only issuing one new thing every six months; this widescreen snapshot of his work makes it impossible to forget just how good he is at what he does.</p><p>
    Although billed as the work of Alan Braxe &amp; Friends so as to allow for the inclusion of occasional drop-ins like Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter (with whom Braxe co-produced the aforementioned Stardust track), singer Benjamin Diamond (who sang on it), and little-known French crooner Romuald Louverjon (who comprised the other half of a short-lived outfit called The Paradise), the creative partnership at the heart of <i>The Upper Cuts is between Braxe and bassist Fred Falke. Together, the duo account for seven of the album's 12 tracks, and of those, only 2003's ""Love Lost"" is anything less than thrilling. The rest, from the glinting electro of ""Most Wanted"" to the staccato, fat-bottomed basslines of ""Palladium"" to the defiantly unfashionable 80s guitar peel of ""Rubicon"", stack up one-by-one to mount a pretty convincing case for Braxe as French house's most slept-on producer.</i></p><p>
    In addition to those seven cuts, the asthmatic coo of Paradise's dewey-eyed ""In Love With You"" and the Stardust track (which, I'm happy to say, is still great as ever) <em>The Upper Cuts contains one throwback, one remix, and one misstep. The throwback is Braxe's first ever release, 1997's ""Vertigo"", and although it's dwarfed by his later material, it makes sense here, especially as a curtain closer. The remix is his spangly 2002 disco edit of Shakedown's ""At Night"" which is every bit as strong as his original material. (Braxe's remixing chops don't get often their proper due-- check out his versions of Annie's ""Heartbeat"" and Death From Above 1979's ""Black History Month"" for more.) The misstep is, unfortunately, the compilation's only track from 2005, a Braxe-produced Long Beach g-funk pastiche for a sorta hip-hop artist named Rec. It seems jokey and blunted and woefully out of sync with everything else here, and its presence makes the exclusion of ""Rubicon"" B-side ""Chrystal City"" even more confounding.</em></p><p>
    By this point, though, I'm just tinkering, trying to find a way to make a V-8 supercar run a hundredth of a second faster. When it comes down to it, <i>The Upper Cuts is sleek and inspired and exhilarating, and after nearly a decade, it's nice to have all this stuff in one place. If it can manage to spark some sort of coming out party for Braxe and company over the coming months, even better, although frankly I'll be just as happy to settle for another ""Rubicon"" and a few more Annie remixes. </i></p></div>"|1169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1169-the-upper-cuts/|8.9|Mark Pytlik

    on it that would tip off an unwary listener that it wasn't recorded
    between 1977 and 1983. These dates are commemorated on Family
    Recordings's recent <em>New Waves</em> compilation as the bookends of
    the halcyon days of post-punk and new wave. But all trends have
    shadow-trends beneath them, and in this case, the term ""shadow""
    couldn't be more appropriate.</p><p>
    
    The Starvations is the bastard scion of two gothic punk-noir bands,
    each of which formed in '77 and disbanded in '83: The Birthday Party
    and the Misfits. Blending the druggy storytelling and inebriated,
    throttled vocals of the former with the overstated morbidity and
    sloppy energy of the latter (with an L.A.-centric nod to the
    psychodrama of X, another band that formed in '77 and, while they
    didn't disband, began turning away from gut-wrenching punk and toward
    rootsy eclecticism around '83), the Starvations' unreconstructed take
    on classic L.A. punk is consistently exhilarating.</p><p>
    
    If modern L.A. spawns more materialistic pop-punk and less of the
    bohemian underbelly-trawling favored by the indelible X, then the
    closest the Starvations come to modernity is on the first and last
    tracks of <em>Gravity's a Bitch</em>. Both are strong, and neither cedes
    too much aesthetic ground to the slickster zeitgeist, they're just
    sleeker, smoother rides than the unruly dirges that divide them. </p><p>
    
    Opener ""The Rising Horizon"" begins as a clipped, anthemic stomp, then
    blurs into a slashing glide during the verses, and finds Gabriel Hart
    reprising his constant themes of dopesick love and inevitable decline.
    Trudging across quicksand that represents both the downward pull of
    horse (""And I walked/ And I sunk/ Severed my limbs/ Swimming in
    junk"") and of unrequited love, Hart also acknowledges the darkly
    romantic magnetism of such dire circumstances: ""And it never rains
    here but I won't complain/ Who'd ever want to wash away all the
    pretty stains?"" </p><p>
    
    The title track closes the record with a stylized flourish: A cool
    wash of melodic bass, shushing percussion and quietly ringing guitars
    allow Hart's voice more space to breathe than usual, before the song
    revs up with chugging chords and flecks of detuned piano. A bleak
    terrain unfolds between these two landmarks: The funereal drums and
    wobbly arpeggios of the teen-angst dirge ""Purgatory"" (""We're slowly
    decaying into our parents/ Frigid and soulless and co-dependent"");
    the damaged surf-rock and call-and-response shouts of ""Where was I?"";
    and the literally opiated spaghetti-western theme ""This Poison"". By
    addressing the vices of junk, booze, and love with equal desperation,
    the Starvations have a little fix for everybody. </p></div>"|7484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7484-gravitys-a-bitch/|7.5|Brian Howe

Does the world really need another summation of Johns Flansburgh and Linnell's career? Actually, yes. <i>User's Guide</i> has a few advantages over its predecessors: by benefit of its timing, it's much broader and perhaps more representative of their two decades of prodigious output. Furthermore, by virtue of its defining concept, it avoids the obvious chronological presentation of singles and shoulda-been hits in favor of a much more playful overview whose organization reflects the Johns' guiding whimsy.</em></p><p>
    
    Song length-- not history or popularity-- informs the order of the generous tracklist. Beginning with the 47 seconds of ""Minimum Wage"", the tracks get increasingly lengthy, peaking with the 12th song, ""Guitar"", which clocks in at nearly four minutes; the remaining tracks get progressively shorter until the 51-second ""Spider"" closes the compilation out. The packaging cleverly plays out this highly ordered approach: the sleeve contains ""A Fairly Complete List of They Might Be Giants Gigs Since 1985*"" (""*1982-84 have yet to be documented"") along with a timeline, a list of presidents mentioned over two decades, and a ""comparison chart of personal pronouns in TMBG song titles."" The cover art is derived from the UPC bar code, which expands to dominate the cover art and purports to measure melody, fidelity, and quantity. It's a sly reversal of the typical best-of aesthetic. Instead of presenting disparate material as a holistic statement of artistic intent and accomplishment, <em>User's Guide</em> explicitly acknowledges its commercial aims: These 29 songs are simply subjects from which variable data can be gathered, analyzed, and graphed. And sold.</p><p>
    
    While there are some curious omissions (where's ""(She Was a) Hotel Detective""?), the tracklist proves that Flansburgh and Linnell never lost their gifts for quirky and complex pop hooks, as evidenced by late-career highlights like ""Cyclops Rock"" and ""Doctor Worm"". However, songs like ""James K. Polk"" reveal a tendency toward humorless overliteralization of history; ""Meet James Ensor"" and the subtext-heavy ""Purple Toupee"", on the other hand, exposes a tendency toward the opposite.</p><p>
    
    However, a statistical analysis reveals more than just the band's prolificity and diversity of output. <i>User's Guide</i> collects five tracks from the well-selling <i>Flood</i> (1990); four from <em>Apollo 18 (1992); and three songs each from the band's self-titled debut (1986) and breakthrough <i>Lincoln</i> (1988), as well as from their recent children's album <i>No!</i> (2002). All in all, 18 of the 29 tracks date from the period 1985-1994, whereas only 11 are from 1995-2004/5; TMBG cull more tracks from the fewer albums in 1985-1994 and fewer tracks from the greater number of albums in 1995-2004/5. </em></p><p>
    
    While these figures may seem slightly tedious presented here, they prove scientifically what many listeners have long asserted, at least beginning with <em>Apollo 18</em>-- the first decade of They Might Be Giants' career produced an abundance of quality material (see: ""Ana Ng"" and ""She's an Angel""), but the second decade of their career has seen an appreciable decline in that quality (see: ""Boss of Me"" and ""James K. Polk""). This slippage could be attributed to the mid-90s post-grunge hostility to levity and quirk or perhaps to They Might Be Giants' transformation from a duo into a full band, which expanded their range beyond their charm. That's only subjective speculation, though. <em>User's Guide</em> seems to be an honest acknowledgement of the band's falterings as well as an implicit promise to keep playing around.</p></div>"|8001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8001-a-users-guide-to-they-might-be-giants/|7.2|Stephen M.

Any time spent worrying that this latest label switch might blunt the female duo's anarchic onslaught, however, is evidently time that should've been used more constructively, as these eight tracks-- whose 33-minute running time straddles the blurry line separating EP from LP-- comprise some of the twosome's spiniest, least-embraceable material yet.</p><p>
    Using a rapidly decaying assortment of analog electronics, inflamed guitars, splintered tape loops, and inscrutable vocals, the veteran duo of M.V. Carbon and J. Gräf belong to the growing contingent of noise peddlers whose work bears ever less direct relation to standardized rock-based (or jazz, or electronic) forms. While portions of their 2004 Load album <em>Waiting for Armadillo</em> occasionally alluded to traceable forward-moving rhythms and brooding No Wave song structures, here Metalux present their unstable sonic collages in an even further advanced state of decomposition, showing little regard for listener comfort or comprehension.</p><p>
    The mysteries begin right there in the title: what Victim, of what Space? Clearly Metalux do not intend to portray themselves as mere victims (or bystanders) of their art, as throughout the album the two serve as willful agents of their music's constant mutation, sculpting their sound as forcibly as any act inside or out of the noise beehive. Theirs is an inorganic science; the album's short attentioned anti-grooves feel ungoverned by precision or continuity, and so bear little resemblance to more drone-centric peers like Double Leopards, the locomotive pummel of Lightening Bolt or even the prolonged disrepair of a typically patterned Wolf Eyes composition.</p><p>
    ""Sunny Krakow"", which matches distorted punk vocals to unanchored Harry Pussy-ish guitar, is about as familiar as Metalux is willing to get here, as the vocals dare an almost-melodic hook or two before the guitar scrabbles noisily away over the rocks. Likewise ""Tremor Loss"" begins with a rather refined patch of (what sounds like) harpsichord until legions of tiny, insect-like sounds swarm to nibble the piece to confetti. Throughout the length of theatrical cuts like ""Shipwreck"" or ""Shelldrum"", Carbon and Gräf are stubbornly reluctant to allow their audience to become attached to any one noise, creating instead an ever-shifting mosaic of serrated fragments beneath their cryptic, always-just-shy-of-earshot lyrics. As compelling and curiously unknowable on 10th listen as on the first, it doesn't take much time spent with <em>Victim of Space</em> before you might begin to suspect that the true object of its title is the person sitting in your chair, listening to your stereo.</p></div>"|5658.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5658-victim-of-space/|6.8|Matthew Murphy

    crime story. In January of 1947, Elizabeth Short, a 22-year-old
    aspiring actress, was found in a vacant lot just outside Hollywood. Her
    body was bruised, abused, and literally cut in half. Journalists took to
    calling her the Black Dahlia-- possibly because of her supposed
    penchant for wearing all black to garner attention from men-- and her killer
    was never found. It's one of the more gruesome crimes in the long sordid
    history of Hollywood.</p><p>
    
    The band didn't originate in that city, though. But it
    only seems fitting that they instead exploded onto the U.S. metal scene
    from Detroit, Mich. It may be over 2,000 miles from where Short's
    murder occurred, but Detroit-- with its vacant buildings, high
    crime rate, and low incomesy-- is a perfect fit for the barrage
    of anger and desperation of <em>Miasma</em>, the band's sophomore
    release.</p><p>
    
    The Black Dahlia Murder combine elements of melodic Scandinavian death
    and black metal bands with the more straightforward style apparent in
    classic Florida death metal. All of the superfluous elements have been
    excised-- there are no brooding, operatic keyboards, no triumphant,
    clean-vocal choruses. Instead, the band shifts from one furious riff to the
    next, and vocalist Trevor Strnad mixes things up by switching from deep
    death-influenced growls to a high-pitched rasp. The guitars seem to
    feed each other, and the dual harmonies between the two are one of the
    bands strongest assets.</p><p>
    
    The pummeling, mid-tempo instrumental ""Built for Sin"" leads into the
    galloping ""I'm Charming"", and the band doesn't really let up again until
    the disc's end. New drummer Zach Gibson keeps the band rolling at an
    uncompromising pace, and yet things never get boring. While so many death
    metal bands are content to ride the blast beat 24/7, Gibson mixes
    things up quite a bit. In ""Statutory Ape"", for example, he switches from one
    rapid-fire-beat to another throughout, rarely easing up on the snare,
    yet he still finds plenty of time to abuse the bass drum every now and
    then for good measure.</p><p>
    
    Overall, the band should be commended for taking a form that is
    becoming increasingly derivative and making it seem fresh. There are plenty of
    comparisons that can be made (as many reviews of the band's work will
    prove), but there isn't a single moment of <em>Miasma</em> that feels
    borrowed, forced, or copied. From the lyrical tone-- which spends plenty of
    time in the dark and violent, but never has to rely on the Satan-laden
    macabre-- to the fast-and-insanely-furious riffage, the record stands as
    a testament to powerful modern metal, with a nod towards the past and
    an eye towards the future.</p></div>"|1166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1166-miasma/|7.0|Cory D. Byrom

""Whatcha call it, grime?/ Call it what ya wanna call it, I'm fine,"" scoffs the serenely confident Kane Robinson on ""Mic Check"", one of many decidedly (un)grime tracks on the 20-year-old prodigy's debut album. If g**** is now understood to be everything British, brutish, blackish, hollered, squawking, Dizzeed, manic, squelching, and/or Wiled out, this would-be ambassador is running off the genre's pot-holed backroads onto freshly rolled-over blacktop that's still steaming in its stealth smoothness. Instead of clobbering like a cracked-up Thing popping Pow! pills, this East London MC nightcrawls through the shadows, slipping deep lyrical daggers over beats that are meticulously polished, waxed, and primed to play mirror to Kano's steep autobiographical musings.</p><p>
    
    A fierce student of both hyper-speed UK beat styles and (gasp!) American hip-hop, this doe-eyed poster boy's intrinsic influences are often bore out by an uncanny camou-flow that slyly adapts to <em>Home Sweet Home</em>'s varied sonic textures. ""If it's a good flow, it must be Kane,"" he brags, expertly utilizing the naturally egomaniacal third person. Luckily, unlike many delusional, self-satisfied young crowers, Kano offers enough solid evidence of his vocal dexterity to make Matlock blush.</p><p>
    
    While recent breakouts like the Game rep their idols with simple ad nauseam shout-outs, Kano's nods are more intrinsic to his rhyming style. Though it's nearly ruined by a cringe-worthy, Black Sabbath-sampling chorus, the clipped-guitar ""99 Problems"" Jr. scuff-up ""I Don't Know Why"" finds the MC acutely aping Jay-Z's <em>Blueprint</em>-era cadence (along with a couple Oompa Loompa-esque sing-song lines) as he lands pretty-boy punches with a knowing grin. The album's lead-off title track showcases his roided-chameleon adaptability as he eases listeners into his wordy realm by initially winding-up with a slow, off-kilter flow before gunning in-the-pocket fastballs all over the track's airtight electronic playing field, courtesy of frequent collaborator Mikey J.</p><p>
    
    Produced by famed world traveler Diplo, the frighteningly impressive ""Reload It"" provides a living, breathing drum 'n' bass gauntlet that Kano duly annihilates as it skips between double-time snare-snap and ambling, woozy wobble. With guest shots from Ritalin-defying mic sharks Demon and D Double E, the track also offers a crystalline illustration of why Kano's trans-Atlantic potential is off the charts: Relative to his peers' slang-slinging verbal zig-zags, Kano's immaculate enunciation and unruffled demeanor are easily deciphered without a gully-made <i>RWD decoder ring.
    
    Not to say his wordplay and content are simple. Along with a wide-range of production styles and multi-flow grandstanding comes an equally assorted thematic breadth. Whether he's bitching-out brut bouncers with verbal assaults (""Typical Me""), ruminating on teenage love (the Streets-produced ""Nite Nite""), calling-out closed-minded youths (""Nobody Don't Dance No More""), offering a mega-ton boast-a-thon (the already classic
    ""P's &amp; Q's""), or just getting his Hennessy on (""Remember Me""), Kano injects nearly every track on </i><i>Home with refreshing depth. Backed by luscious wind-chimes and chipmunk squeal vox samples, the lovey-dovey ""Brown Eyes"", with its not-so-romantic refrain of ""I don't want to fall in love,"" is noticeably more conflicted and realistic than your typical female-demo pandering fare.</i></p><p>
    
    Stellar album cuts like the introspective stunner ""Sometimes"" see Kano tempering his encroaching stardom with second-thoughts. ""When they say I'm the next one to blow I say why do they think me,"" he admits, ""All I do is stay in mostly and sleep/ And all I do is watch Channel U and drink tea/ Why me?"" He combats such internal struggles with staggering maturity and an appealing, hard-working sense of earning ends on his own terms. ""The hood think I'm signed, they like 'I swear he is'/ But I'm still in the grind writing lines all day, every night,"" he insists with focused intensity and ghetto guilt on the blue-collar anthem ""9 to 5"", taking absolutely nothing in his life for granted.</p><p>
    
    Such striving, self-motivational forces are no stronger than on ""Signs of Life"", a six-minute-plus cautionary tale marked by arch strings and doom-boom sci-fi bass. Crushing the easy-made glorification of hip-hop's drug-slinging stereotype, he points a clenched fist at a locked-in bruva: ""You ain't so rich now/ I bet you feel like a prick now/ Cause where's all your fancy shit now/ Where's your whips, chicks, and your bits now/ Shit, you should have fixed up/ Fuck drugs, the mic you should've picked up/ And it was all for big bucks, now your sittin' in a cell doing sit-ups.""</p><p>
    
    Kano doesn't just defy the sonic tradition of grime on <em>Home Sweet Home</em>, he defies the tidy boxes MCs are usually plopped in upon their arrival. ""I'll never have a calm day's rest until my album's in stores next to Kanye West,"" he claims, and though the likelihood of a record store sorting their wares by first name seems slim, the two MCs do share an urge for multiplicity. Laying down roads every which way, this nimble artist's future destination is promising and unpredictable: No matter what happens to grime, Kano is poised to endure.</p></div>"|4598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4598-home-sweet-home/|8.4|Ryan Dombal

    to what is still rather secretly the most fertile time
    of musical evolution in the Pitchfork demographic's average
    lifetime, and given that I was between the ages of -2
    and 4 when it was actually occurring, I don't feel too
    bad about being late to the party.</p><p>
    
    The time period I'm talking about is 1977-1983, quite
    conveniently what is covered on this here double-disc
    compilation. To use the relevant genre classification
    instead of carbon-dating, it's the post-punk/new-wave
    era that <i>New Waves</i> cohesively digests, and while those
    two musical descriptors have become watered down over
    the years from overuse, this collection is a welcome
    reminder that they once were potent movements which
    laid the groundwork for much of the music we put in
    our ears today.</p><p>
    
    Ay, there's the rub: One can't help but listen to a
    collection like this one without coming to a handful
    of shocking realizations about those
    flavors-of-the-moment I've done my part to hype-- turns
    out they're not making such an original statement
    after all. Which doesn't bother me so much-- derivativity is nothing to be ashamed of when done
    well-- except that I feel I've failed as
    a critic by not mentioning Jilted John's self-titled
    single as antecedent to Art Brut's everyday-occurrence
    anthems, or by only now realizing how much of
    Interpol's musical-mascara genetic material is derived
    from the Damned's ""Grimly Fiendish"". Oh well, never
    too late to start faking it.</p><p>
    
    The reason why the sound of 77-83 is still so vital is
    probably due to the sound's intermixing of punk
    rebellion with dance-floor awareness, a mixture that
    still hasn't fully seeped into the deepest layers of
    indie rock, even given the recent hullaballoo. Of
    course, not everything on <em>New Waves is an ancestor of
    poor, neglected dance-punk...there's a spectrum from
    standard punk snare-thwak (i.e. the Ramones,
    Buzzcocks) to disco-club infiltrators (i.e. Sparks,
    Robert Palmer) between which each of these 45 artists
    plant their sound. It's a worthy reminder, however,
    of how the reactionary, one-dimensional punk movement
    rose-lens celebrated by Warped Tour types lasted about
    nine months total, before the punks stopped thumbing
    their pierced noses at disco and started assimilating
    it.</em></p><p>
    
    Then you can sit back and appreciate how the mixture
    was taken even farther by via the girl-group
    injections of Blondie (""Hanging on the Telephone""),
    the empty-room folk activism of Billy Bragg (""A New
    England""), Bow Wow Wow's herky-jerk rhythmicity (""Go
    Wild in the Country""), or Teardrop Explodes' hijacked
    soul-brass (""Reward""). Clicking off before post-punk
    segued into New Pop, <i>New Waves offers up a few scraps
    of foreshadowing in ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" and
    M's ""Pop Muzik"".</i></p><p>
    
    There's very little to complain about
    with this set. It's very clear that the collection is
    unabashedly Britcentric, and the inclusion of pub-rock
    like Splodgenessabounds ""2 Pints of Lager &amp; a Packet
    of Crisps Please"" might seem unnecessary, but after
    years of Ameri-canon indoctrination, it's refreshing
    to hear the story from a different vantage. I could
    maybe also haggle about the songs picked for certain
    artists; for instance, while it's always nice to be
    reminded that Dexy's Midnight Runners had more than
    one song, there's never a reason not to give people
    every possible chance to hear ""Come on Eileen"".</p><p>
    
    But minor quibbles aside, <em>New Waves</em> is about as solid
    a primer for this era of musical history that can be
    acquired legally. Some of this territory was already
    covered by Rhino's <i>No Thanks!</i> box or the OOP <i>1-2-3-4: Punk and New Wave</i> set, but this
    collection, packed as it is into two discs and with a
    strict one-song-per-artist rule, offers a much more
    concise argument for the time period's relevancy. So
    while a couple listens through <em>New Waves</em> may make you
    feel a bit like an idiot for having loudly trumpeted
    the fresh sound of Franz Ferdinand to your friends
    last year, it's not too late to dig the sound of the
    first time around.</p></div>"|2091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2091-new-waves/|9.0|Rob Mitchum

The Rapture gives good face. James Murphy gives good copy. Delia and Gavin give good ""oh, they're easily my favorite"" hipster trump card. But Maclean is the most effective. If any DFA records come close to hands-aloft status, it's his ""Give Me Every Little Thing"" and ""You Can't Have It Both Ways"". They're, you know, house music. No need for any prefixes or suffixes.</p><p>
    Maclean's former band, Six Finger Satellite, were a bruising mixture of skinny tie and thick neck, mixed eye-meltingly loud by Murphy live, and all but blueprinting Les Savy Fav (who I like better, but why lie?) on record. Which might explain why his dance music is so muscular (have you listened to those early Rapture EP's lately?), but it does make <em>Less Than Human</em>, a good chunk of which could be described as ""gentle"" or at least ""pretty"", a bit surprising. It's not quite the masterpiece everyone (at least me) was hoping for (the exclusion of ""You Can't Have It Both Ways"", for example, should be punishable <em>Midnight Express</em>-style) but it does deliver on the hype, which in 2005 is almost the same thing.</p><p>
    ""Shining Skinned Friend"" is filled to bursting over its bacon fat drums: theremin noise, vocodered sprites, ghostly coos, vocal synths, italo ripples, ""dark"" Euro vocals. This is his happening and it freaks me out. ""Give Me Every Little Thing"" is pure bliss, from the interstellar electrical storm opening to the whammy bar keytar solo that closes it out. In between, you've got a giant's handclaps, a groaning slap bass, barbiturate P-Funk chanting, and call-and-response synth squiggles. ""Tito's Way"" is one of the few nu-disco tracks that recognizes the power of the Party Whistle. (No ""whoop whoop"" though.) It also has breaking bells, steady-rocking drums, farty robot bass, and sassy-yet-dead-eyed femme vocals.
    </p><p>
    The rest of the record is surprisingly melancholy. ""Love Is in the Air"" is Metro Area after a crying jag. ""In The Afternoon"" is background music for a breakup scene in a WB teen drama starring Ralf und Florian. ""My Time Is Running Out"" opens with Arcadian, cascading synth-strings and trills of bleeps like all-white Christmas lights blinking on and off. It could be the intro to a Kylie Minogue record before it rolls out another gently bumping, mid-tempo groove. (Actually, re-reading that, I'm not sure if it <em>isn't</em> a Kylie Minogue record.) Closer ""Dance With Me"" lopes for 12 minutes towards a climax that never comes, a busted robot shooting little sparks of piano as it limps towards Nancy Whang's siren song.

<p>
    The title track of <em>Less Than Human</em> (which appears nowhere on the album) was first released on the 2004 <em>DFA Compilation #2</em>. But come on: Even allowing for coincidence, is it possible to hear it without this year's Daft Punk album looming like an unanswered question? Alongside Vitalic-- Maclean's closest contemporary, especially when you factor in the penchant for queasy synth miniatures like opener ""AD2003""-- Maclean the student is now doing the ""robot rock"" thing better than the masters. And he only rocks about half the time. But then again Daft Punk once made their rep singing about unrequited love, rather than just breaking hearts.

If you're familiar with YMO, you might imagine he was involved in Kraftwerk-influenced electronic music, or perhaps more traditional pop, but as it happens, he made his name as session bassist and playing in bands like the psychedelic Apryl Fool and folk rockers Happy End-- a far cry from the modernist slant of his reputation in the West. However, he also made a record in 1978 called <em>Cochin Moon</em> with keyboardist Shuka Nishihara, and future YMO bandmates Sakamoto and Hideki Matsutake that is arguably more bizarre and forward thinking than anything he's done since.</p><p>
<em>Cochin Moon</em>-- co-credited to Pop artist Tadanori Yokoo, who did the incredible Bollywood-style cover art-- is an electro-tropical soundtrack to a fake movie of the same name. That is, there was no film called <em>Cochin Moon</em>, but after visiting India, Hosono was inspired to make music suggesting the exotic, luxurious, and seemingly wonder-filled scenarios played out in Indian cinemas. However, the actual sound he and his cohorts came up with is often a world away from India: Imagine a totally electronic world of chattering bugs, fluttering birds, magic harps and drums that alternate between a thud and a blip. Hosono shares compositional duties with Nishihara, and Sakamoto's playing style is readily on display, as are Matsutake's considerable programming skills. As a historical document to YMO fans, <em>Cochin Moon</em> is interesting; as a slice of out-music stuck somewhere between Tangerine Dream, Wendy Carlos and Disney's <em>Fantasia</em>, it's almost classic.</p><p>
    
    Hosono's ""Malabar Hotel"" trilogy-- comprised of a ""Ground Floor"", ""Upper Floor"" and ""Roof Garden""-- occupied the first side of the original LP, and eases me in like a snake. The brief ""Ground Floor...Triangle Circuit on the Sea-Forest"" begins with high-pitched insect-sirens, soft enough to mistake for crickets even when I know analog synths and primitive computers generate them. In the distance are waves breaking on a shore, and soon bass synth notes and alarms go off signaling the transition into the ""Upper Floor...Moving Triangle"". As a THX-esque sound test introduces fluttering percolations, an off-balanced, Indian-styled beat materializes. Half the beat is on the right, and half on the left; in between, where a snare should be, sits only the call of some robotic frog and a fly that just won't go away. This is tropical, and I can hear a pattern creep up from behind, and what sounds like men chanting. Filtered through an alien vocoder, it's difficult to decipher what they're saying, and as soon as I get close enough to make out the fuzzy, sonic outline of their words, they're interrupted by stuttering bass melody that eventually turns into a demi-cadenza, held afloat by ever more quickly percolating drum machine pulses. Bursts of angelic chord clusters accentuate the ends of melodic phrases, and from out of nowhere come electronic harp glissandi. Up and down, forward and backwards it runs, and soon the fizz of synthetic ocean mist drowns out the pulse, leaving only enough room for the pixie-bell harp, sudden eruptions of lava bubbles and that damn fly.</p><p>
    
    ""Roof Garden...Revel Attack"" is born out of the fly's orbit, and introduces squeaky (near glitch) underwater computer blips. They start soft and spaced out, but soon gather momentum, all the while turning the fly buzz into a chorus of warped jet trail. A human voice speaking Japanese dips above the cacophony, and someone appears to be unwrapping a small package on the right. Then, just as suddenly, a synth line reminiscent of the melody from the ""Upper Floor"" reappears, with digitally harmonized voices supplying watercolor fanfares. The harp returns, in counterpoint with helicopter pulse on the right. The helicopter, apparently not satisfied in its supporting role, grows larger, overwhelming the competing melodies with sprawling whirl, and soon with more watery mist, like a rainstorm called on by a village shaman. And after a while, the storm passes, marked by the toll of a gong. And the fly is still there, buzzing in its lowest register before the gong closes the doors of the hotel and the piece fades into black.</p><p>
    
    Nishihara's pieces are a bit less exotic, but no less interesting. ""Hepatitis"" is a shiny, bouncy piece of computer pop that might work well as a soundtrack to a Pixar sci-fi short about robotic fish. The bubbling sound effects are everywhere to be found, while cartoon-y melodies and state-of-1978 synth programming turn what might otherwise overwhelm itself with its own goofiness into something more bizarre. ""Hum Ghar Sajan"" (apparently, taken from a phrase by Indian guru Granth Sahib) is understated synth raga, as if informed equally by Kraftwerk and Ravi Shankar-- and accurately predicts Asa Chang &amp; Junray's excursions into electro-exotica. A chanted vocal melody gives the song a mystical edge, and its recurring, high-pitched instrumental solo breaks sound straight out of Indian classical music.</p><p>
    
    ""Madam Consul General of Madras"" is more tribal, sounding like ritualistic gamelan music meeting head on with the electronic tone poems of Wendy Carlos. Gradually, layers are painted on top, including a spazzed out synth line and more percolated synth patter sounding leftover from the Malabar's lobby, and the piece dissolves into dizzying keyboard clutter and the cricket sirens from the ""Ground Floor"". And I guess you can check out any time you like, but...well, you know the rest.</p></div>"|4016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4016-cochin-moon/|8.3|Dominique Leone

    LP, Little Barrie are indeed Little Barrie. Whew. This much we also
    know: The Barrie in question is, presumably, frontman Barrie Cadogan,
    a stand-in ax-man on Morrissey's 2004 tour; he are Little Barrie.
    Bare-bones drummer Wayne Fulwood and nimble bassist Lewis Wharton
    round out the London trio; they are Little Barrie.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, Little Barrie could be a miniature jam band. Barrie's
    unimpeachable guitar virtuosity is their centerpiece, reason enough to
    name the assemblage in his honor. On record, at least, Little Barrie
    eschew jam bands' unexpurgated wankery, but they do embrace the corresponding hippie
    aesthetic. Smell the patchouli: ""Take a trip,"" Cadogan sings on
    breezy, hooky ""Free Salute""-- managing to sound like Jacks White (vox)
    and Johnson (six-string)-- but neither he nor the persistent groove
    are going anywhere, maaan. On ""Long Hair"", long-hairs are repeatedly
    advised to ""hide your face."" Punning ""Burned Out"", ""Greener Pastures"",
    and (whoa <em>after</em> ""Stones Reprise""!) ""Stones Throw"", further open
    the doors of Little Barrie's nostalgedelic perception. Hendrix is
    already inside, but so are Brown and Mayfield.</p><p>
    
    In these parts, of course, jam bands are rarely discussed, unless
    they're undercover as avant gardists from New York (Sonic
    Youth) or Cologne (Can). Though perhaps too meat-headed to really
    whole-lotta love, Little Barrie are too energetically melodic to dismiss completely. The presence of ex-Orange
    Juice leader Edwyn Collins helps. He produced the album shortly before
    being hospitalized for a brain hemorrhage, and he captures the band's
    raw enthusiasm, scratching it with workmanlike feedback in all the
    right spots (like, right behind the ears).</p><p>
    
    When the recycled smoke clears, Little Barrie could use more
    songwriting help from their patrons (Moz, Collins) and less hu-huh
    inspiration from Ocean Colour Scene's lobotomy-trad bong. ""These are
    the ghosts I've made,"" to quote former tourmates The Bees (aka A Band
    of Bees), who share the band's Lot's-wife-like leanings. Little Barrie
    have made, conjured up, or flat-out copied some of late-60s British
    rock's most venerated ghosts, and a few more from classic funk, all
    with mixed results. Perhaps the album's title isn't tautological,
    after all; Little Barrie know their name, but they don't yet seem to
    know who they <em>are</em>.</p></div>"|4986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4986-we-are-little-barrie/|5.7|Marc Hogan

The man who brought you the Pixies and, by extension, the alternative rock boom of the early 90s, took four days out of his busy schedule touring with his triumphantly reunited old band to record in Nashville with such legendary session men as Steve Cropper and Spooner Oldham. The result is <em>Honeycomb</em>, as album that has its inspired moments but ultimately comes off like something of a vanity project, with Black tackling a midpoint between classic country and classic r&amp;b;, winding up with a sort of adult contemporary album full of lyrics about shrimp and selkies, those half-seal/half-human creatures of Orkney legend.</p><p>
    
    To his credit, Black seems genuinely excited to be playing with his heroes, and he's invested in the material, as always, but the backing definitely has the ultra-competent feeling of a session rather than a band really gelling. Likewise, Black's written several great songs, but he may not actually be the best guy to sing them, as his voice has a tendency to die out on some of the more ambitious melodies. For instance, ""Strange Goodbye"" is a masterfully written duet that could have easily come from the Stax hit factory in the late-60s, but Black and his ex-wife Jean (they were still married at the time) here aren't a compelling pair-- ironic considering it's written about their impending break-up.</p><p>
    
    The record's two peaks are actually covers of Dan Penn &amp; Chips Moman's ""Dark End of the Street"" and key Black influence Doug Sahm's ""Sunday Sunny Mill Valley Groove Day"". The former finds Black doing a pretty good job with a tricky classic soul melody, while the latter is an exuberant, uptempo country-rock tune that the whole band seems to enjoy playing. The third cover, ""Song of the Shrimp"", is a bizarre ballad about a shrimp that leaves his parents for New Orleans, not realizing where the shrimp boat is taking him. Black, of course, turns in his own share of odd lyrics, peaking on ""Strange Goodbye"" and bottoming out these lines from the opening of ""Another Velvet Nightmare"": ""Today I felt my heart slide into my belly/ So I puked it up with liquor/ And I slept right where I lay.""</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Cropper livens up ""My Life Is in Storage"" with richly phrased guitar solo and Black spikes his closing exhortation to ""Sing for Joy"" with tales of alcoholism and murder. The sum of it all is a bit less than what you might expect from the parts. Black has strangely proven himself an accomplished writer of songs that would sound great in the hands of a soul singer and a house band, but he's also proven that he's not necessarily always the right singer for his songs.</p></div>"|785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/785-honeycomb/|6.0|Joe Tangari

Jones...all or some of which might be the same people) co-owned house music in 2004 with Tiefschwarz and Blackstrobe. Like the Frenchmen, they restored Brutish physicality to an underground house scene that had pushed clicks and pops about as far as they could go. But where Tiefschwarz stuffed their famed remixes with details, GPM tracks favored simple, crisp rhythms á la Metro Area and unadorned electro basslines. And where Blackstrobe oozed throwback EBM attitude and campy menace, GPM was almost friendly, nearly lush. The result was straight up enough to pull those who don't give a shit about microhouse and just subtle enough to pull those who do. Their second anniversary mix CD is probably the one record we'll point to in a decade to say ""that was house in 2004.""</p><p>
    Like many electrohouse pioneers, GPM has felt the pull back to house of more micro-proportions. Clubland boundaries are being upended all over the place this year, from Sasha and Digweed caning Kompakt, to Villalobos' omnipresence (everywhere except his club dates), to Isolée being the toast of all the rock mags (and, ahem, websites). ""Nerd house"" has almost achieved equal footing with prog trance, mostly since the international club circuit is coughing up blood. (Alternatively, and more frighteningly for some, there was never any difference between them except scale of economics.) Unlike the <i>GPM Second Anniversary Mix</i>, which had the cohesion of any mix builty of entirely out of the catalog of a strong label, <i>Body Language strays further afield, sometimes deeper, sometimes more revelatory, but rarely as fun.</i></p><p>
    Opening with a few tracks of clicks and cuts and a DJ trying to remember the names of all the Isley Brothers, trunks are finally rattling with the bass and nasty sand dune riffs of Booka Shade's ""Panoramic"". As the bass grumbles and glowers, Marlow's ""Quiet"" patterns some delicate vocal science (a cheap route to ecstasy that works every time) before the banging drums of Marc Houle's ""Has to Do"" brings a bit of needed earthiness to all those half-breaths and chipped syllables. Guido Schneider's remix of Dub Kult's ""Bip"" has buried handclaps and scatting vocals dipped in heavy-echo syrup. There's a long stretch of 80s revivalism leaning hard on the arpeggiation, be it Depeche Mode (Sterac Electronic's ""Destination Reached"") or Vangelis (Hans-Peter Lindstrom's ""I Feel Space"", which throws in some tribal house bongos for the hell of it).</p><p>
    Francisco's ""Moon Roller"" applies Erasure melodies to Superpitcher drums, and Tiefschwarz's ""Isst"" brings the fat, farting Mylo-esque bass and cymbal crashes. ""Ball of Light"" is more so-clean-you-could-eat-off-it, immaculately produced tech-house from Mathew Jonson. Isolée's remix of Recloose's ""Cardiology"" does this insane thing where it makes it sound like a saxophone is dying, astral moans trailing off in background. Jay Haze's ""Appreciate"" is gospel house recorded through God's own phaser. And that's M.A.N.D.Y's big trick here. <i>Body Language feels like microhouse, experimental house, whatever you want to call it. It certainly trades in all its clichés-- twitters and chits, streaks of overdone echo like someone rocking a guitar amp back and forth (try it...you can make your own Chain Reaction track!), fountains of time-stretching. But everything is rooted in a more traditionally body-friendly form of dance music, or at least has a steady, heavy rhythm holding it down. Even when they go trolling for dork respectability they wanna yank those glasses off and muss your hair.</i></p></div>"|5657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5657-body-language-vol-1/|7.6|Jess Harvell

Featuring appearances from Josephine Foster and Espers' Meg Baird, in addition to the uniformly stellar work of his crack(ed) band the Poison Tree, <em>Further From Grace</em> positively shimmers with willowy, sun-dappled ensemble playing, and firmly establishes Castro as yet another noteworthy voice of the present acid folk resurgence.</p><p>
    
    As is the case with Philadelphia's Espers, Castro's music hearkens less to old-timey American forms of Appalachian folk or country blues than it does to the golden age of 60s-70s UK folk-rock, as practiced by groups like the Incredible String Band or Mellow Candle. Inching softly away from some of the more blatant Donovan/ Syd Barrett solo emanations of his 2004 self-released debut <em>A Spy in the House of God</em>, here Castro and company employ an ambitious menu of exotic acoustic instruments to forge a verdant, medieval-tinged sound, one which draws on any number of pan-global folk traditions. And though there are times when the album threatens to capsize beneath its own preciousness (such as on the delightful, flute-centric ""To This Earth"", which incautiously risks floating away like a puff of new-agey Celtic Myst) the strength of Castro's melodic compositions and the group's deft musicianship should manage to enchant any but the most <em>Hobbit</em>-phobic listeners.</p><p>
    
    With his clear, refreshingly unmannered vocals on straightforward tunes like ""Won't You Sing to Me,"" Castro strikes a figure recalling Tom Rapp of Pearls Before Swine or a young, more starry-eyed David Gilmour. In Castro's lyrics, cheeks tend to be white as snow and eyes are apt to shine like diamonds, which is perhaps another reason why most of the memorable passages on <em>Further From Grace</em> are instrumental in nature. The opening ""Sun Song"" combines Baird's lap dulcimer with Otto Hauser's nimble hand percussion and Foster's mesmeric, wordless vocalizing to create a full-scale gypsy swoon, one that could easily continue on weightlessly for miles before you realize your gas tank is empty and your watch has lost its hands.</p><p>
    
    Even further transporting is the brief ""Music for Mijwiz"", a whirling Middle Eastern dervish on which Castro plays the titular Arabic, double-reeded woodwind over a sandstorm rhythm, or the epic ""Deep, Deep Sea"", a captivating piece whose lengthy intro is adorned with Adam Hershberger's lyrical, surprisingly jazzy flugelhorn, before Castro eventually leads the whole company back into more familiar Soft Machine-like canyons and valleys. As the album closes with the aptly-named acoustic soar of ""Walk Like a Whisper"", the seasoned folk-rock traveler will undoubtedly recognize many a feature of this tranquil landscape, but will also likely be helpless to resist the urge to continually retrace Castro's every step, reluctant to miss out on a single contour of this varied and beguiling album.</p></div>"|1813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1813-further-from-grace/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

You could not have a more perfect case study of that principle in action than D.C.'s Medications, whose five song, self-titled opening salvo last year was an accomplished, tantalizing mission statement for a band keen on establishing an identity for themselves separate from Faraquet, the band that essentially became Medications after a personnel switch.</p><p>
<em>Your Favorite People All in One Place </em> takes that EP and builds on it in two directions: one more lush and melodically intense; the other drier, more serially rhythmic, and somewhat closer to the old-fashioned guitar tangle of Faraquet and 90s Dischord post-hardcore. Excellent opener ""Surprise!"" goes in the former direction, creeping out from a protracted intro with choppy drums, roiling guitars, and melodic vocals that hover pensively in the verses. The song builds to multiple shuddering climaxes, Devin Ocampo's guitar stabbing out with ragged riffs and snowballing lead lines. It's a stunner, and it sort of makes you wish they had spent the whole record exploring this sound.</p><p>
    As it happens, much of the rest of the album opts more for typically D.C.-sounding rhythmic jaggedness, which to be fair the band does quite well. The trio engage in precise, tightly wound interplay as a matter of course, peaking on ""Opinions"", which veers into frenetic passages of wild, jittering guitar, stuttering bass, and calamitous drumming. Drummer Andrew Becker has some banner moments on the record, especially his razor-sharp fills on ""This Is the Part We Laugh About"", which adds a whole dimension to the song that it wouldn't work well without.</p><p>
    On that note, Medications are sort of a modern power trio, each member's instrumental parts playing an integral role in the band's make-up. Using that approach, they've turned in a solid debut album that nicely balances their pop tendencies with their more destructive urges. If there's any one thing holding this record back from greatness, it's the occasional passage that's too start-stop for its own good, but those are few and far between, and <em>Your Favorite PeopleÉ</em> should please the Dischord contingent.</p></div>"|5611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5611-your-favorite-people-all-in-one-place/|7.6|Joe Tangari

Maybe it doesn't matter, since Portland-via-Madison, Wisc., quartet the Vanishing Kids paradoxically encapsulate both clichés. Of course, with industrial journeyman Martin Atkins (whose résumé includes stints with PiL, Killing Joke, and Nine Inch Nails, as well as producing a laughable industrial Christmas album) turning the knobs, the band's goal is clear-- sculpt a murky leviathan of a post-punk album on par with PiL's <i>Metal Box or the Cure's <em>Pornography</em>. Strangely though, <em>The Selfish Mirror</em> suggests bigness using a small medium, tantamount to <em>Moby Dick</em> performed on a miniature ship inside a glass bottle.</i></p><p>
    Yes, this album flaunts cavernous reverb, booming drum fills, and stratospheric synth splashes, but so does the soundtrack to <em>The Lion King, and certainly no one's throwing ""Hakuna Matata"" onto mixes alongside </em><em>Loveless</em> tracks. But hey, in a perfect world size doesn't matter, just who you sound like, and the Vanishing Kids definitely choose the right touchstones. Aside from Atkins' occasional nostalgic bursts (does ""Shadow of a Doubt"" <em>really</em> have to sound as crunchy as Killing Joke's ""Requiem""?), the band maps out an eclectic, albeit threadbare, agenda of 80s new wave, shoegazer, and noise rock. Fortunately, a revolving door policy on vocals and equally skittish song stylings keep this otherwise stale fish relatively fresh.</p><p>
    The album's first third finds the band fitting securely in their profound britches. Despite its forceful Geddy Lee/Perry Farrell hybrid vocals, ""Tell Me"" swiftly glides on gloomy basslines and obsequious pleading to, ahem, ""tell me."" Massive opener ""Shadow of a Doubt"" avoids crumpling under its own weight, instead swelling consistently throughout its six-and-a-half minute duration. Unfortunately, the song's slow, ethereal grind and frontman Jason Hartman's breathy vocals only tease as the majority of the album fails to manage the unwieldy aesthetic.</p><p>
    The cerebral title track overestimates its faux-My Bloody Valentine allure, and after eight-minute epic ""Snow Angel"" sputters on only 60 seconds worth of ideas, it's clear the Vanishing Kids feel more comfortable with immediate, hooks-driven sprints than languishing drone-rock marathons. ""Sleeping Beats"" and the first half of closer ""Talk"" may seem to nonchalantly toss out bits of dance-punk and electro-pop compared to more deliberate, protracted numbers, but these songs chug along without hitting any musical potholes from start to finish. Fortunately, <em>The Selfish Mirror</em>'s shortcomings arise not from poor taste or lack of skill but from unfamiliarity with their own limitations; paying homage to your pet bands is great, but in the end these guys should write what they want to write, not what they want to want to write.</p></div>"|8539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8539-the-selfish-mirror/|6.9|Adam Moerder

    Motown in the narcotic haze of the Velvet Underground
    and the Jesus and Mary Chain, weaving traces of country alongside
    their warbling horns, ecstatic strings, and droning distortion.
    Now here's <em>Layourbattleaxedown</em>, a surprisingly consistent B-sides and rarities disc. Opener ""Forces"" tips listeners off that this set, like
    earlier EP collection <em>Boyoubetterrunnow</em> or side project Heikki,
    leans more toward spare, country-tinged songwriting than their
    breakthrough's candy-store pop, lush sleigh ride ""Lady December""
    proving the primary exception.</p><p>
    Even if you're not as big on the band's more countrified efforts, don't miss their version of ""Miss You"". Like many of the Rolling Stones'
    hits, this one always seemed like basically just a riff, albeit a
    killer one-- plus ""disco sucks"" man, amiright? But the Concretes'
    version concentrates on the lyrics' stiff-lipped heartbreak, replacing
    Jagger's preening yowl with Victoria Bergsman's slight, dispassionate
    vocals, hauntingly multi-tracked for the wordless hook. ""Oh, baby,""
    one wonders, ""why you wait so long?"" After all, saxophones are dying,
    electric guitars crumbling like a decrepit imperial capitol. The pace  and mood rarely alter throughout this collection, but the mournful ""Oh
    Baby"", complacent ""Free Ride"", and string-drenched ""The Warrior"" all
    would have been strong enough for <em>The Concretes</em>. Arboreal
    lullabies ""Branches"" and ""Under Your Leaves"" err toward preciousness,
    but they're (stop me now) growers.</p><p>
    ""Seems Fine"", from the full-length, captures the <em>idée fixe</em> of the
    Concretes-- or most great pop songs, for that matter-- in that it's
    all about appearances, or rather, all about the disjunction between
    crystalline, perfect exteriors and uncontrollable emotion. ""Seems Fine
    Shuffle"" gives the original a bluegrass makeover, and it turns out to
    be an improvement. Here, as throughout, <em>Layourbattleaxedown</em>
    strips bare the moody, terse melancholy that gives even the Concretes'
    peppier material its emotional resonance.</p></div>"|1572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1572-layourbattleaxedown/|7.3|Marc Hogan

The duo's fertile sound is unusually malleable, due in part to a top-notch succession of collaborators ranging from the No Neck Blues Band's David Nuss to Nels Cline to Thurston Moore. For their third album, <i>China Is Near</i>, White Out have enlisted perhaps their most sympathetic ringers yet-- percussionist William Winant and avant-chameleon Jim O'Rourke. And with the aid of these familiar, well-traveled guests-- each of whom has appeared on more records than most of us could consume in a decade-- White Out are here again able to boldly pilot their freeform clamor toward distant alien horizons.</p>
<p><i>China Is Near</i> marks White Out's second studio go-around with their frequent live partner O'Rourke, following their Ecstatic Peace alliance on 2000's <i>Drunken Little Mass</i>. Thanks in large measure to Culbertson's extensive use of burbling analog synths, that album showcased the collective at their most overtly jazzy, their cosmic agitations frequently recalling early-70s era Herbie Hancock or Sun Ra at his Moogiest. And while <i>China Is Near</i> retains a few hazy echoes of that predecessor, here the group has further atomized their nebulous sound, continually spiraling the music's various fragments further and further outward from previously mapped territories and definable genres.</p>
<p>With the presence of Winant, the album unsurprisingly finds White Out's work increasingly dominated by its astonishing variety of percussive textures. Neither Winant nor Surgal is the type of percussionist who settles easily for the mundane duties of timekeeping. Here instead the two augment their wide assortment of drums with an eclectic array of chains, scrap metal and gongs as they stretch their loose, intuitive playing to inhabit whatever open space Culbertson and O'Rourke can spare. This approach results in intensely evocative tracks like ""Empty Centre"", a gauzy drone that Winant and Surgal encompass with jingle bells and the rattle of knives to ward off all evil spirits and/or grizzly bears. Similarly, on ""Mutinous"" a mounting force of tympanis pound like the sinister footsteps of an encroaching invasion force as swarms of growling electronics slowly build to do feverish battle, the listener forcibly encouraged to quickly choose sides.</p>
<p>Since they use such an unorthodox array of electronic and treated instrumentation-- such as the distorted, unearthly autoharp that rakes across the face of ""Stipledmoon""-- it's often difficult to pinpoint exactly which musician is generating each specific noise. O'Rourke, as always, blends effortlessly into his surroundings, and though this masterful versatility makes him a valuable addition to virtually any ensemble, it can also render his individual voice rather invisible. (If he's contributed any guitar here, I must admit I don't immediately recognize it.) Consequently there's nothing on <i>China Is Near</i>-- besides its general air of restless, questing curiosity-- that stands out as distinctively ""O'Rourkian,"" but that certainly does little to detract from this album's molten, form-shifting splendor.</p></div>"|8795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8795-china-is-near/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

In jazz you have Louis Armstrong and the Hot Five records. In blues take your pick of pre-WWII blues artists like Son House or Charley Patton. In rock'n'roll you have Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry. In punk you have the Ramones. Even if you don't particularly rate such seminal artists, you still have to admire their mastery of their respective idioms and the way each came to define a form.</p>
<p>Hip-hop doesn't seem to work the same way; few if any fans believe it peaked with the sides released by Enjoy and Sugarhill at the dawn of the 80s, as much as they might dig selected singles. Maybe hip-hop was such a new and radical expression it took its community a few years to understand what it was about and how best its innovations could be applied. It being the late 70s, a time when recording was widespread and after a few novelty records had become hits, the awkward early stages were fully documented, to resurface later on endless streams of ""Old School"" comps and, occasionally, reissues of complete albums. Here are two such artifacts, the first two long-players by Grandmaster Flash's group. Everyone knows now how influential Grandmaster Flash was to the mechanics of DJing, with his invention and popularization of various mixing and scratching techniques. And speaking of the ""early stuff is best"" phenomenon mentioned above, his 7-minute piece ""The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel"" (not included on these records) is arguably the finest DJ collage in hip-hop history. The group released a handful of other stellar early singles-- ""Superrappin'"", ""Freedom"", ""Birthday Party"". As an ""album artist,"" though, well...</p>
<p><i>The Message</i> has two absolutely essential songs, both of which have been widely anthologized. The title track has rightly been hailed as hip-hop's first overtly political expression, with sharply observed scenes of New York at its broken-down worst voiced by lead Furious Five rapper Grandmaster Melle Mel. Less discussed is the fantastically likable musical backing, with the squelchy synth riff that's now completely burned into the collective pop music consciousness, and it's stiff'n'funky drum machine beat. But even the sonic treat of ""The Message"" pales next to the polished chrome man-machine of ""Scorpio"", for my money the greatest early electro track and the best vocodered robot-rap of all time.</p>
<p>The next tier of <i>The Message</i> contains single ""It's Nasty"" and the upbeat party jam ""She's Fresh"". The former appropriates the music from Tom Tom Club's ""Genius of Love"" the way Sugerhill Gang appropriated Chic, and no matter what you're doing out front, it's hard to go wrong with that particular synth riff and beat. Down further is ""It's a Shame"", a forgettable but inoffensive mid-tempo rap, and then the record bottoms out with ""Dreamin"" (a tribute to Stevie Wonder-- sample lyrics: ""Stevie, you make me wonder. I dream about you, Stevie"") and ""You Are"", abysmal ballads that sound like they were pulled from a ""Mr. Show"" parody.</p>
<p>Shortly after <i>The Message</i> was released Melle Mel became Grandmaster Melle Mel and took two of the Furious Five with him to form his own group. Melle Mel recorded ""White Lines (Don't Do It),"" the final classic track associated with this crew. Flash soldiered on, assembling a new group and recorded <i>They Said it Couldn't Be Done</i>. Oddly, it's more consistent than the debut, with no flat-out bad tracks, but also no real high points. The use of synthesizers is more sophisticated (which isn't always a good thing), and some of the quick-cut proto sampling has historical interest. When the chorus hooks are on, as with ""Girls Like the Way She Spins"", it's not bad. It was 1985, though, and by then Run D.M.C. was on the scene; relatively speaking Grandmaster Flash sounds way behind. Sensing this, Flash steals a title and a sound with ""Rock the House"", which has guitars and a mid-tempo rock backbeat though none of the energy of the guys from Hollis. Flash would release a couple more records in the 80s without much success, and then he dropped off the radar, resurfacing periodically to play shows when given a boost by current DJs who understand his importance to hip-hop's development. In his world, though, ""importance"" doesn't necessarily pay.</p></div>"|11751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11751-the-message-they-said-it-couldnt-be-done/|6.4|Mark Richardson

On the leadoff track, ""Bandages and Scars"", Jay Farrar (the only one remaining from the band's original 90s line-up) reveals the impetus for <em>Okemah and the Melody of Riot</em>: ""the words of Woody Guthrie ringing in my head"" got him thinking about the current political climate, which ostensibly inspired these songs. It's as if, denied the opportunity to record Guthrie's lyrics, Farrar has made his own <em>Mermaid Avenue</em>, one that bypasses the original's time-capsule quality for an explicitly contemporary relevance. Or maybe it's the times that have made Guthrie more significant now than he was seven years ago.</p><p>
    
    He's not the only musician Farrar turns to for guidance on <i>Okemah, which is perhaps his most politically and socially charged album since <em>March 16-20, 1992</em>. He alludes to Bob Dylan on ""Afterglow 61"" (named after the highway) and both Gil Scott-Heron and John Fogerty on ""Jet Pilot"", which revisits Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Fortunate Son"" but with a much more specific target (just guess). But Farrar doesn't seem to be trying to re-fashion himself as a modern-day Guthrie on these songs; as always, he's much too reverential toward his influences to think he might occupy their ranks. Instead, he's reviving them for a tumultuous era that he thinks needs them desperately. ""There's no reason to be downhearted/there's music in the wheels there to be found,"" he sings on ""Afterglow 61"", elaborating on the genre he helped define.</i></p><p>
<em>Okemah</em> proves to be not just 13 protest songs, but 13 songs about protest songs. Farrar believes unquestioningly in music's ability to affect tremendous social change, soothe a nation, or stop an ""endless war with no moral face."" That idea still sounds as attractive and optimistic now as it was 70 years ago when Guthrie sang about the Dust Bowl, and although he doesn't seem to consider that perhaps reverent hindsight grants protest music most of its power, Farrar wants to resurrect that musical populism as a weapon against the current administration. </p><p>
    
    Appropriately, <em>Okemah is grassroots in both politics and sound. Despite its new line-up, Son Volt churns out the same sturdy riff-heavy rock of <i>Trace</i> and </em><em>Wide Swing Tremolo</em>, but the band sounds more invigorated on songs like ""6 String Belief"" and even on slower tracks like ""Medication"". Farrar's and Brad Rice's sandpaper guitars evoke the mythic Americana of 70s Southern rock, especially against the chugging rhythm section of drummer Dave Bryson and one-time Meat Puppet Andrew Duplantis on bass.</p><p>
    
    Despite the heightened band dynamics, Farrar remains the central figure on these songs, and his distinct approach complicates and occasionally compromises <i>Okemah</i>. The melodies are less lethargic than those on <em>Straightaways</em> and the lyrics more intelligible than those on <em>Wide Swing Tremolo; if they're devoid of Guthrie's humor, at least ""Jet Pilot"" manages some disgusted sarcasm toward (you guessed it) Bush. And ""Who"" manages a devious ambiguity: ""Who makes the minutes move/ The post-meridian news/ Who, who else but you?"" ""You"" could be either the populace or Fox News; the song either a populist anthem or a middle finger.</em></p><p>
    
    As the album progresses, though, Farrar's lyrics become increasingly stilted and veiled, reverting to the forced wordplay and disconnected evocations of his most obscure songs. In the past, this tendency toward purple opacity could be excused, but on <em>Okemah</em> it hinders Farrar considerably, clouding the issues rather than arguing or elevating them. ""Ipecac"" takes on big corporations and class differences-- important topics after the Enron fallout-- but, head-scratchingly, he warns us to ""watch out for love like ipecac"", perhaps more drawn to the word's cutting consonants than to its connotations. <em>Okemah is in the end too cerebral, lacking the gutpunch impact of the best protest music. With ""rock and roll 'round my head like a 6-string belief,"" Farrar's been thinking so much about Woody Guthrie that these songs never leave his own head.</em></p></div>"|7331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7331-okemah-and-the-melody-of-riot/|6.8|Stephen M.

    features gorgeous packaging, and most of the song titles are either in
    French or chock full of commas. Yes, it's yet another side project
    release from the folks that brought you Godspeed! You Black Emperor and
    Set Fire to Flames and the Silver Mt. Zion Hoonja-Doonja Ice Cream
    Symposium. The fact that there's a Motherfucker (as in Jackie-O) along
    for the ride doesn't change the overriding MO of the primary players.
    <em>Aurora</em> is gorgeous, cinematic stuff, dominated by cello and eccentric
    percussive instruments like clevises and rototom shells. And,
    unsurprisingly, the packaging is equally gorgeous-- an embossed gatefold
    CD sleeve complete with black disc envelope and postcard, as well as
    slightly skewed typeface setting.</p><p>
    
    Folks not yet inured to this collective's bombast and grandeur might be surprised by how gentle and serene these
    tracks are. ""Histories Repeating..."" lists in a foggy meditative
    fashion for nearly 17 minutes, while the comparatively
    pop-length
    ""Why She Swallows..."" twinkles and trembles. When there's a threat of
    the folks rocking out in a hamfisted fashion (as on the very first
    track, ""Quelques Mots Pleins D'ombre""), Esmerine opts to err on the
    demure side of aggression. Folks unfamiliar with all things godsped,
    but with a predilection for groups like Rachels and the Dirty Three,
    might also want to give this a try.</p><p>
    
    For those that got over the
    gorgeous instrumentation and the importance of each telegraphed
    loud-soft shift and the interminable song titles sometime after <em>Slow
    Riot for New Zero Kanada</em>, this disc will seem relentlessly polite and
    tasteful. More importantly, <em>Aurora</em> won't sound much different than
    anything this group-- together or apart-- has already produced. That's
    not necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that, for all intents and
    purposes, it's the same thing.</p></div>"|2909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2909-aurora/|6.2|David Raposa

    problems.  From age 11 onward, Caouette locked the camera's lens on himself and his inconceivably dysfunctional family, capturing
    every tragedy in their spectacular meltdown.  Those years of navel-gazing eventually culminated in his meta-documentary <em>Tarnation</em>,
    a riveting record of one young man's attempts not just to survive, but to flourish under impossible circumstances.  The music of
    Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart occupies an aesthetically similar space.  Artists who intimately embrace their own struggles are commonly
    chided for being solipsistic, but Stewart, like Caouette, engages in a self-scrutiny so ruthless and unflinching that it surpasses
    mere melodrama and becomes magnetic, grotesque, even beautiful.  Their work seems less a vehicle for vanity or narcissism than an
    instrument of basic survival.</p><p>
    Xiu Xiu's last album, <em>Fabulous Muscles</em>, found Stewart reaching the apex of his accomplishments to date.  All the hallmarks of
    the earlier records-- the juxtaposition of cloying sentimentality with base brutality, sculpted cadences with nebulous noise, and
    husky whispers with tortured screams-- were wrangled into precise pop clockwork.  Pitch-perfect blends of emotional exigency and
    musical accessibility like ""I Luv the Valley OH!"" broadened Xiu Xiu's audience beyond those willing to grit their teeth and wade
    through a morass of confrontational clangor.  <em>La For\xEAt</em>, however, backs off dramatically from the pop side of <em>Fabulous
    Muscles</em> to expand upon its quiet, murky dimension.  Here, Stewart's vocals hang in hazy suspensions of wafting guitars, piercing
    chimes, subliminal drones, and ornately wrought percussion.  ""Clover"" forgoes noisy protrusions in favor of tiptoeing guitar,
    xylophone, and small, sweeping whirs; ""Mousey Toy"" is a dirge of ghostly piano, rattling percussion, and a noisy midsection of
    atonal flourishes, martial rim shots, and gong-like crashes.</p><p>
    There are upbeat holdovers: ""Muppet Face"", after opening with cascading glockenspiel, blossoms into a lean, multilayered synth groove,
    a mechanism with many tiny moving parts interlocking complexly, while the excellent ""Bog People"" is a runaway engine of crisp guitars
    and synths, drum claps and ratcheting percussive undercarriage.  Xiu Xiu's resonance with Joy Division's knotted, barren dread has
    been noted often, but the similarity to Conor Oberst is usually ignored.  It's especially apparent on ""Bog People"": ""There will
    always be a headless neck/ There will always be happiness,"" Stewart sings, tweaking the last syllable of happiness, and going on
    to push fervently against his vocal range in a way that will sound instantly familiar to Bright Eyes fans.  ""Pox"", another clear
    standout, is a suicide glide through skittering drums, slithering guitars, and an urgent electronic pulse.</p><p>
    One of Xiu Xiu's greatest assets is singularity: You'd never mistake one of their songs for another band's.  While some music carries
    on a heritage, Stewart's seems like a purely generative, spontaneous expression of a unique sensibility, and what's especially
    remarkable is how a record that seems so brash on the surface reveals its subtlety by increments.  Over repeated listens, a dialogue
    emerges within Stewart's lyrical blend of the sweet and profane.  <em>La For\xEAt</em> is a record that mutters to itself in the dark:
    ""I tried hard to be good to you,"" Stewart sings on ""Clover"", ""I felt peace inside my head.""  And after what seems like an eternity
    on this content-loaded record-- we didn't even touch on one of the best songs, the beautifully deformed smooth-jazz of ""Ale"", with
    its measured, plosive foghorn tones and razor-sharp lyrical turns-- that call is answered on the ominously amorphous ""Rose of Sharon
    (Grey Ghost)"": ""You tried so hard to be as sweet as you can for me/ But I don't see you for who you are.""</p></div>"|8827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8827-la-foret/|7.9|Brian Howe
