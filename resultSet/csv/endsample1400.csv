    actually read the book his band is named after.  I've always found this somewhat
    amusing, especially considering how literate the man is otherwise.  Hell, his
    second album has a track that consists of nothing but him naming off great
    authors over a baroque arrangement, and his first ends with a Wordsworth poem
    put to music.</p><p>
    Recently divorced from the Setanta label (amicably), Hannon shows up on Parlophone
    with a seven-piece band (including himself), apparently ready for a change in
    direction.  For <i>Regeneration</i>, Hannon more or less leaves the orchestras
    and superhuman wit of past offerings at the door, mostly opting to treat the
    Divine Comedy as a self-contained band for the first time since their disowned
    first album, <i>Fanfare for the Comic Muse</i>.  Back then, the group was still a
    guitar/bass/drums trio on the Northern Irish club circuit.</p><p>
    To help realize this relatively stripped-down approach, Hannon and his newly
    solidified lineup called in über-producer Nigel Godrich, who at the time was
    fresh off helping Radiohead realize <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac</i>.  Godrich's
    recent work actually surfaces in quite a few places on <i>Regeneration</i>,
    though the little ambient noises and the tape-manipulated wash of sound that
    close ""Eye of the Needle"" represent the only time they really come to the fore.
    Those same atmospheric flourishes color the edges of much of the rest of the
    album, though, giving it an overall sonic unity and depth that works well in the
    absence of the usual soundwall present on Divine Comedy records.</p><p>
    The album opens with one of Hannon's reliably depressing musings on life and time,
    entitled ""Timestretched.""  ""There's not enough hours in the day to say all that I
    want to say,"" he sings, later offering that ""there's not enough lines on the stave
    to capture the music I crave.""  His distinctive low baritone sounds as good as
    ever, and throughout most of the album, he remains considerably more reserved in
    his delivery than he ever used to, steering clear of the manic yelling of ""Charge""
    or the cheeky operatics of ""Sweden.""  On the one hand, this aids the low-key
    subject matter he's dealing with here, but on the other, it makes for a rather
    less interesting listen.</p><p>
    That said, there's not a bad song to be found anywhere on this disc, and it
    remains engaging for nearly its entire duration, only falling into the background
    in a few isolated spots.  Mostly, though, there's gold a-plenty to be mined from
    a song like ""Perfect Lovesong,"" which comes close to making good on its title.
    ""Give me your love and I'll give you the perfect lovesong/ With a divine Beatles
    bassline and a big old Beach Boys sound,"" he proposes, just as Joby Talbot
    launches a recorder countermelody sweet enough for ""Sloop John B.""  It's matched
    by understated glockenspiel and echoing auxiliary percussion, all on top of a
    loping, easy-going beat that makes it hard not to bob your head.</p><p>
    ""Note to Self"" follows with slinking guitars and a steady beat before breaking
    into the crashing bridge, where Hannon cries out ""what the fuck is happening?""
    like he really doesn't know.  ""Monday/ Restate my assumptions/ Heaven and Hell do
    not exist,"" go the song's opening lines, and the band does a fine job of echoing
    that uneasy sentiment with the music.  The mix is densely layered, and multiple
    listens reveal small blasts of feedback, squirming keyboards and other disconcerting
    noises which, buried throughout the song, heighten anxiety with their subtle
    presence.</p><p>
    ""Lost Property"" plays with imagery, naming off raincoats, tennis rackets, and
    other lost objects as a metaphor for the passage of time and moments that really
    matter to us over arpeggiating piano and a subtle string arrangement.  The
    aforementioned ""Eye of the Needle"" follows, with Stuart Bates' treated trombone
    blending with electronic effects for an unusual background texture.  Hannon reels
    off some great imagery and commentary with lines like, ""The cars in the churchyard/
    Are shiny and German/ Distinctly at odds with/ The theme of the sermon.""  The
    song's Spartan arrangement and placement in the middle of the album work together
    to provide some needed variety and segues perfectly into ""Love What You Do,"" the
    album's most obvious single.  The verses are doused in glockenspiel and
    well-blended synth and recorder, while the chorus positively soars on electric
    piano ostinatos and fluid bass.</p><p>
    The rest of the album is characterized by somewhat colder textures, like the
    guitars that don't really sound like guitars on the chorus of ""Dumb It Down""
    and the meandering piano on ""Mastermind.""  The second verse of ""Dumb It Down""
    bends and warps with post-production effects, a surprisingly avant-garde move
    that works quite well.  ""Mastermind"" is subdued and largely acoustic, aside
    from sonar-like sound effects.  Hannon ends it with the line, ""All the dreams
    that we have had are gonna prove that we're all mad/ And that's okay.""</p><p>
    The title track gets even chillier on the verses, with icy piano and hushed vocals,
    and even refuses to warm up when Ivor Talbot's guitar rips it open for the two
    bridges.  ""The Beauty Regime"" closes things off on a warmer note, with its 70s
    R&amp;B-influenced; rhythm section and ultimately inspirational message.  Hannon tears
    into the plethora of modern image-oriented magazines that clog the shelves these
    days, exhorting the listener to forget everything they've read there and just
    live life.  It's strange how such a ridiculous cliche manages to sound convincing
    coming at the end of an album like this.  The thing is, no matter what he says,
    Hannon sounds utterly sincere, and that's what really drives his message home.</p><p>
    In the end, <i>Regeneration</i> turns out to be a validating listen, much like
    the Divine Comedy's past efforts.  It's certainly a lot less melodramatic, and
    that's both a strength and a weakness.  The music is great, and the honesty is
    refreshing, but sometimes I miss the old Hannon-- insecure, but brash nonetheless,
    and witty as hell.  The past aside, <i>Regeneration</i> delivers, and often
    brilliantly.  Dante would be proud, even if Hannon still hasn't read his book.</p></div>"|2341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2341-regeneration/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    Skeleton Key was pretty cool. They wrote good rock songs and banged on garbage
    cans. Capitol Records took notice. They signed Skeleton Key. And then, as often
    happens in the music industry, they fucked the band thoroughly and vigorously.
    Skeleton Key's one proper album, <i>Fantastic Spikes Through Balloon</i>, got
    less than no promotion, failed to gain the kind of support it no doubt would've
    garnered from an indie label, and was later yanked out of print. Skeleton Key
    lost their limbs on the battlefield of alternative music, and it turned out to
    be a fatal wound.</p><p>
    
    In the military, they have the Purple Heart for people who meet such a fate. A
    thoughtful, kind token to say, ""Hey, dude, sorry we sent you to have your knee
    blown off in 'Nam""-- a gesture of appreciation for someone who was screwed over
    in service.  The music industry has never been particularly good about showing
    appreciation for its soldiers.  Unless you consider Jethro Tull ""fuckin' hardcore,""
    the Grammy is essentially a joke.  Awards are only given to the so-called heroes
    of the business.  But what of the wounded?  What recognition do the poor souls who
    have been reduced to collateral damage by the thoughtless machinations of the
    record industry receive?  Erik Sanko and his bandmates should have, at the very
    least, each received a medal, depicting in fine bronze and gold engraving a
    musician being brutally raped by a smiling record exec.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, a little piece of metal probably wouldn't have mattered all that much
    to the boys of Skeleton Key, who have since gone on to plenty of other projects.
    Junk percussionist Rick Lee and drummer Steve Calhoon formed Enon with ex-Brainiac
    guitarist John Schmersal.  And now, frontman Erik Sanko has returned with a
    pleasant, if not terribly exciting, solo record on a friendly little label.</p><p>
<i>Past Imperfect, Present Tense</i> is a solo album in the truest sense of the
    term-- every single note on the album is composed and played by Sanko himself.
    Given that Erik is primarily a guitarist with an interest in keyboards and
    strange noises, it makes sense that this record would be a more subdued effort
    than the tattered junkyard jams of Skeleton Key. Indeed, Sanko's guitar and voice,
    with some additional atmospherics provided by subtle effects and keyboard
    flourishes, constitute the album's core. Sanko is, without question, a talented
    man, both as a performer and a songwriter. But, despite the fact that <i>Past
    Imperfect</i> sprung entirely from the loins of a single creator,
    it only occasionally registers as particularly affecting.</p><p>
    
    When it does register, however, it does so with remarkable elegance and style--
    there are a few moments here that are absolutely intriguing. The shaky, slithery
    synthesizer part that appears throughout ""The Perfect Flaw"" is utterly entrancing,
    and the track is this incarnation of Sanko at his finest-- subtle, downcast, and
    vaguely haunting. Hints of this run through the album as a whole, but are rarely
    developed enough to yield truly potent results.</p><p>
    
    Much of <i>Past Imperfect</i> seems to rely on a similar formula-- a sparse,
    usually minor guitar figure, a shaky vocal melody, and some atmospherics thrown
    in for good measure. Sanko manages to use this recipe to pretty good effect, too,
    on occasion, such as in ""While You Were Out,"" a song that occasionally bears an
    uncanny resemblance to the live version of Radiohead's ""Like Spinning Plates.""
    With ""That Train,"" Sanko picks up the pace a bit, but the Spartan arrangement and
    lack of change in dynamics tethers the song to the tag ""pretty good.""</p><p>
    
    Aside from a few deeply hypnotic moments, Sanko's isolation doesn't really seem
    to help <i>Past Imperfect</i> much.  A more diverse range of sounds would have
    benefited the album greatly.  As Sanko surely knows, the music world can be a
    cruel, horribly unfair place.  It's best not to face such things alone.</p></div>"|6997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6997-past-imperfect-present-tense/|6.4|Matt LeMay

    I was weaned on pop radio, and anything less than ""the best"" sounded like
    chicken-scratch.  It took me a few years, but eventually I came to appreciate the
    immediacy of more raw recordings.  Now I have a distaste for music that sounds
    too glossy.  It works in intricate electronic music and R&amp;B;, but when I hear a
    rock band with that overproduced sheen it leaves a bad taste in my mouth-- it's
    hard for me to avoid the sense that there's a certain lifestyle being sold along
    with the music.  I'm just glad my tastes turned tail, because five years ago, I
    might have been all over this stuff.</p><p>
    
    The Zincs isn't so much a band as it is the work of one man, Jim Elkington (aka
    Jim Zinc).  He's from London, but like so many mystifying Brits, his accent
    virtually disappears when he sings.  Elkington's voice sounds rich and worn with
    age-- a weathered old bastard like Paul Weller or Mark Lanegan-- but his music is
    a twangy breed of rock-and-roll that seems sure to have come out of the rural
    American Midwest.  Yet, the Ohio Gold label is actually based in Chicago, Elkington's
    current home.</p><p>
    
    The Zincs might get accused of being alt-country, but the little details Elkington
    spreads throughout his songs keep the album from being pigeonholed as part of the
    No Depression scene.  ""I Remember"" begins with strange, whining electronics and
    Elkington's vibrant finger-picking.  Halfway through, the song shifts suddenly
    into searing guitar distortion, then back to the melody before this short, slow
    little introduction ends.  ""Two Patients"" picks up with a bender of a groove,
    punchdrunk guitars swerving back and forth across the lines set down by the bass
    and drums.  ""I had forgotten what it means to be scared,"" Elkington sings, but he
    sounds far from cowed.</p><p>
    
    ""Never Endeavour"" reveals a more vulnerable side.  Jim breathes reassurances (""we'll
    weather together away from the cold""), and the soft guitars and drums fade into an
    organ solo that restates the main melody really sweetly.  On ""Opening Time,"" the
    deliberate snare-tick and acoustic strum paint a lazy picture that doesn't need to
    be elaborated upon beyond the song title; Elkington asks, ""Close your eyes, were
    they closed all the time?"" and the mellow slide guitar admits as much.  It's a
    drinking song, and there seem to be a few of them on <i>Moth and Marriage</i>,
    but while each is world-weary they're also heart-warming.  ""Whisper in the Well""
    is built around a dismal chorus (""There's a whisper in the well tonight/ Soak
    this parasite""), but the meandering guitar jangle, tambourine and repetitious
    hook make it dirge so good.</p><p>
    
    ""X in Executor"" cranks the volume as Elkington yowls distortedly into the mic and
    layers of guitars weave together in pure <i>Wowee-Zowee</i>-era Pavement chaos.
    With the album closer, ""In the Hallway,"" Elkington returns to the experimental
    vibe, stroking the nylon strings of his guitar into a complex melody that slows
    to a crawl and ends in forlorn harmonica notes.  While he pockmarks his songs with
    odd electronic touches and drones here and there, Elkington's first and foremost
    concerned with songwriting.  And he never takes himself too seriously-- there's a
    current of dry humor running through the record, as on the bossanova-tinged ""The
    Elemental"" where he takes a dive towards self-mockery: ""Show me the list of
    affectations/ I can do all of them without a stop.""  I guess the Zincs' name came
    from the galvanizing property of the ore: I listen to this on the way to work in
    the morning, and it gives me a boost.</p></div>"|8937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8937-moth-and-marriage/|7.6|Christopher Dare

Or a collection of hookless pop that
    props up gorgeous electronic effects?  It's hard to be absolutely certain, but I
    can tell you one thing: for all the work that went into their debut, British band
    South failed to fully deliver on their hype.  Sad, too, because <i>From Here On
    In</i> is inches away from being a success.  It's just that it's weighed down by
    so many repetitive textures and songs that fail to impact.</p><p>
    
    Joel Cadbury handles most of the vocals and routinely swaps drums, bass, keyboards
    and guitar with Brett Shaw and Jamie McDonald.  And on a few of these tracks,
    they make a straightforward Brit-pop combo.  You can hear echoes of some 90s
    Manchester bands like the Stone Roses and possibly a less glamour-stricken Suede,
    and the piano and vocals-- particularly on ""Keep Close""-- are reminiscent of John
    Lennon (or at least Julian).  But the guys only turn out one solid rock song, the
    orchestral ""Paint the Silence,"" and the appealing but derivative ""Here On In.""
    The latter, a summer-day power ballad with acoustic guitars and pastoral keyboards,
    builds to a beautiful, aching climax while Cadbury intones the chorus, surrounded
    by smashed drumkits and mangled guitars.  With songs like this, South has the
    potential to be a great bliss-pop band.</p><p>
    
    But pop isn't enough for South, and when they hit the studio, things got a little
    crazy.  South co-produced the album with James Lavelle, the head of acid jazz
    label Mo'Wax (which released <i>From Here On In</i> in Britain) and the man
    behind U.N.K.L.E.; he collaborated with DJ Shadow on the 1998 hit <i>Psyence
    Fiction</i>, an album widely recognized for sounding great but not actually being
    great.  But, possibly due to Lavelle's influence, or maybe their own excessive
    facility in the studio, South was a bit liberal with the sounds and effects on
    this album, and not necessarily in a good way.  In fact, many of these songs
    mercilessly work a beat without ever taking it anywhere.</p><p>
    
    The instrumentals have a driven pace, but they end up as static ""variations on a
    groove,"" if you'll pardon my soul-professor terminology.  South includes three
    separate versions of ""Broken Head,"" each longer and less interesting than the
    last.  ""All In for Nothing (Reprise)"" kicks off with a terrific drumbeat and
    soaring keyboards (or guitars?), but loses its effect after stagnating for the
    remaining four minutes.  Many of the pop songs are also drowned with texture:
    ""All in for Nothing"" becomes vague and indistinct as the band turns it into a
    canvas for the beats and keyboards.  Even some of the simpler songs suffer from a
    short attention span.  ""Keep Close"" already works as a straightforward song, but
    the guys can't resist the urge to play with the vocal mix or tack a gloomy
    instrumental onto the end.</p><p>
    
    This is even more unfortunate considering that the band actually <i>sounds</i>
    terrific.  The drumming is crisp and limber, and I can't get enough of their
    basslines. Occasionally, they hit a song with everything they've got and it all
    comes together: ""Sight of Me"" segues well from the slower body of the song to a
    solid dance outro.  But the overall impression is of long stretches with little
    to warrant attention; the arrangements are muddied by too many textures and the
    tracklist relies too heavily on dirges, such as the back-to-back woe of ""Recovered
    Now,"" ""Southern Climes"" and ""By the Time You Catch Your Heart.""  With a running
    time of seventy minutes, all the good parts get buried.</p><p>
    
    Last year, South worked with Lavelle on the soundtrack to Jonathan Glazer's <i>Sexy
    Beast</i>, and if you've seen the film, you've heard the stuff South excels at:
    slightly lo-fi atmospheric music that's great in small doses and works well behind
    scenes of criminals breaking into vaults and dreaming about hairy monsters.  But
    the best musical moment of that film comes from punk band the Stranglers, during
    the title sequence: there's a shot of Ray Winstone, several pounds overweight with
    his leathery, bare gut hanging out over tight Speedos, stumbling next to the pool.
    As his groin hangs in the middle of the screen for way, way too long, the Stranglers
    play a little song called ""Peaches"" whose concise drums and raunchy organ mocks
    the scene perfectly.  If South had pushed themselves to make one great moment like
    that, or really anything that evokes images of Ray's fleshy thigh, we might have
    had something a little stickier on our hands.</p></div>"|7381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7381-from-here-on-in/|6.9|Chris Dahlen

    form, and psychedelia is one of them.  I have a lot of reasons for thinking that,
    but the main one is that, as a genre, it's so adaptable.  The advent of decent
    recording technology was one of the main things that made truly psychedelic music
    possible in the first place, so it seems natural that the music should continue
    to evolve with the technology.  Secondly, psychedelia is at best a vaguely defined
    genre distinction, so it's easy to apply it to music that comes decidedly from a
    rock or pop standpoint, but is colored on the edges with noise and effects.</p><p>
    The Tadpoles pretty much exemplify what most American psychedelic music sounded
    like in the 1990s-- melodic rock wrapped in blankets of fuzz, heavily processed
    guitars and the occasional electronic studio effect.  The Tadpoles were adept
    enough at jamming and developing themes, but they were at their best when working
    with concise, punchy songs.  Then they broke up in 2000 (""indefinite hiatus,"" they
    called it), and leader Tom Parker pulled together this retrospective as a eulogy
    of sorts for the band.  By and large, he's come up with a good overview of their
    catalog, taking four tracks from each of the band's four studio LPs, and one track
    from 1997's <i>Know Your Ghosts</i> EP.</p><p>
    The 78-minute disc starts where it logically should, with four songs from the
    band's debut album, 1994's <i>He Fell into the Sky</i>, and proceeds chronologically
    from there.  As such, it gives a clear view of just how much the Hoboken, NJ band
    progressed during their career.  ""Snapper"" opens things in a haze of stompbox fuzz,
    with Parker's tenor voice hanging low in the mix.  Original drummer Michael Kite
    Audino lays on the toms hard, and the sheets of distortion sometimes give way to
    cleanly strummed guitar chords, and even something that might be described as a
    solo at one point (albeit not a very melodic one).</p><p>
    The vocals stay fairly buried and the guitar tones largely the same for the other
    three selections from <i>He Fell</i>, the best of which is probably the slow-burning
    ""The Ride,"" which features some fine playing from bassist David Max and a gloriously
    muddy buildup near the end.  The four selections from 1996's <i>Far Out</i> show
    progress almost immediately, with Nick Kramer's heavily processed guitar coming
    to the fore after the departure of co-guitarist Andrew Jackson.</p><p>
    ""Race You to the Mustard Patch"" drips in wah pedals and vocal effects, while the
    Nick Kramer-sung ""Nazareth"" remains squeaky-clean until about 2\xBD minutes in, when
    it briefly explodes in a ball of distortion and flailing lead lines.  ""Ride the
    World Around the Sun"" features dueling guitars orbiting a solid bassline, while
    ""At Least I'm Not Like Jonathan Carver"" begins floating somewhere in space before
    congealing halfway through into a heavy, aggressive attack.</p><p>
    The portion of the disc devoted to 1998's excellent <i>Smoke Ghost</i> album is
    probably the most solid portion of the compilation, as the band finally hit on a
    combination of songwriting and sound that balanced the two equally.  Kramer puts
    his voice out in front for ""Know Your Ghosts,"" and the band allows for considerably
    more space in the arrangement, setting up some dramatic guitar breaks.  ""Jaded
    Jean"" could easily have been a single, falling into the same noise-tainted pop
    territory that the Jesus and Mary Chain nurtured in the 80s.</p><p>
    Both Parker and Kramer had come a long way with their singing by this point, which
    allowed them not only to handle better, rangier melodies, but also gave them the
    confidence to put them up front in the mix, a move that greatly increases the
    immediacy of the songs.  The only disappointing thing about this section of the
    disc is that Parker has chosen not to include <i>Smoke Ghost</i>'s excellent opener
    ""When I Feel,"" which is easily one of the band's best songs.  Still, the propulsive,
    effects-drenched ""Firecracker"" is a reasonable substitute, if not an ideal one.</p><p>
    ""Judas, This Is Jesus,"" from the <i>Know Your Ghosts</i> EP, follows, breaking the
    chronological flow for a few moments, but it's unlikely that any listener would
    mind, as the song doesn't sound like a step back at all.  It begins with an
    answering machine message of a man saying, ""Judas, this is Jesus.  It's raining
    silver.  Help me,"" a clip that reverberates over the course of the whole
    instrumental, which is otherwise a sticky concoction of molten guitar mayhem.</p><p>
<i>Whirlaway</i>, the band's final album (and their only effort not recorded for
    their own Bakery label) had by far the clearest sound of any of their releases,
    incorporating more keyboards and electronics and largely eschewing the fuzz that
    typified their early work.  Instead, the distortion on ""Crash of the Bug"" is more
    controlled and less opaque.  The guitars take on more melodic tasks, too, soaring
    in tandem behind the verses and bridging the gaps between vocal passages.  Final
    drummer Adam Boyette lays down a furious groove on that album's title song, giving
    Max the chance to toss off an impressive bass lead at one point and ably supporting
    the fluid guitar leads.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the last two tracks each find the band gazing a little too hard at
    their shoes, ending the disc on a fairly unengaging note, but overall, <i>Use with
    Headphones Late at Night</i> is a satisfying look at the Tadpoles' studio career.
    Perhaps the most unfortunate thing about it is that it only focuses on their
    studio material, neglecting to include a single track from <i>The Tadpoles Destroy
    Terrastock</i>, an EP documenting their ferocious performance at the original
    <i>Ptolemaic Terrascope</i>-sponsored Terrastock festival in 1997.  As far as
    definitive statements on what the band was capable of at their best, that EP just
    may be it.</p><p>
    Aside from that, though, there's little to gripe about.  This is, in the end, a
    faithful overview that serves as a fine introduction to one of the great overlooked
    psychedelic acts of the 90s.  Of course, it also catches them wandering here and
    there, but by and large, <i>Use With Headphones Late at Night</i> concentrates on
    the band's most focused work. For most people, this is all the Tadpoles you'll
    ever need.  You may still want to try and catch them destroying Terrastock,
    though.</p></div>"|7915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7915-use-with-headphones-late-at-night-best-of-1990-2000/|7.5|Joe Tangari

And it might. Because <i>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</i>--
    recently reissued by PIAS America-- was the very first electronic music I ever
    bought, and certainly the first I ever heard over and over again. Long ago, before
    I was old enough to drive, I would sit in a small, cluttered bedroom in my parents'
    suburban ranch house, absorbed for hours by the sounds contained on this disc. The
    creeping basslines, the constantly mutating drum patterns, the synth tones which
    moved with all the grace and fluidity of a professional dancer, the strange noises
    that I'd be unable to identify even if I tried. Back then, Aphex Twin was making
    music like nothing I'd ever heard before.</p><p>
    What's become apparent since is that I probably wasn't the only one affected.
    After last year's disappointing <i>Drukqs</i>, it's easy to forget that, back in
    the Warp Records heyday, Richard D. James was to this new breed of ambient and
    electronic music what Babe Ruth was to baseball.  Sure, there were upstarts;
    \xB5-Ziq, Squarepusher and Autechre were all on the scene by the time this collection
    hit shelves. But James was still the posterboy, the presumed ringmaster,
    single-handedly defining a style of music in the minds of many. Now, as a new
    wave of mostly twenty-somethings step to the forefront of IDM, redefining
    electronic music for the third time in a decade, it becomes more and more obvious
    just how far reaching James' influence was.</p><p>
    There's nothing new about this re-release, aside from improved availability and
    decreased cost. But then, improving on this package would be near impossible. Sure,
    the music on <i>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</i> may sound a bit dated (as does,
    to be fair, most electronic music more than a few years old), but there's no
    denying it was the defining statement of Warp's early years, and the foundation
    for the careers of bands like Boards of Canada and Plaid.</p><p>
    The songs here are not ambient in the same way as those on this disc's sequel.
    Technically, most fall into Brian Eno's broad definition of the style-- it can
    be appreciated in small segments just as much as in its entirety.  The music
    develops slowly, unafraid to linger on a particularly effective sound for as long
    as necessary-- the creeping keyboard loop of ""Schottkey 7th Path,"" for example,
    is continually modified throughout the course of the song, but never once
    eliminated from the mix-- but James would never be content as a mere follower in
    anyone's footsteps.  His work here serves a model for what would come to be known
    as traditional IDM.  A simpler version of the style we've grown accustomed to,
    certainly, but IDM nonetheless.</p><p>
    James' early work is heavily indebted to early dance music, filled with beats so
    eminently danceable as to confuse those who only know him from the spastic drum
    patterns that came later. There's little of that here, though. <i>Selected Ambient
    Works 85-92</i> is, rather, an album stretching back to the days before software
    allowed for heavy sampling or glitch technology.  Drum machines serve as its
    backbone and synthesized bass and keyboard sounds provide the meat. Most of the
    songs follow a relatively basic formula as well. One element-- say, a synth melody--
    is introduced and repeated, and as new elements are added with each go round, the
    song gradually builds to a dense, multi-layered swirl.  This Ravel-esque approach
    flavors much of James' older material, and yet, despite the simplicity of his
    equipment and approach, the songs here are both interesting and varied, ranging
    from the dancefloor-friendly beats of ""Pulsewidth"" to the industrial clanks and
    whirs of ""Green Calx.""</p><p>
    Indeed, these early works do a fine job of showcasing James' ability to transform
    even the most seemingly mundane patterns into something unique and interesting.
    ""Hedphelym,"" for instance, is built around a relentless headache-throb cliché of
    a house beat.  But James surrounds the pulsation with an ethereal feedback that
    bleeds all over the track, leaving the percussion awash in a murky solution of
    synth tones, pairing dance music with ambience in ways the Orb never dreamed
    possible.</p><p>
    Slightly more structured (and equally enjoyable) is ""We are the Music Makers,"" a
    track which follows a drumbeat and a bassline past a pair of intertwined synth
    loops and a repeated Willy Wonka vocal sample as simple keyboard melodies pour
    down from overhead.   But the aforementioned ""Green Calx"" is the closest <i>Selected
    Ambient Works 85-92</i> comes to the spastic trickery of which James would become
    such a pioneer.  It matches pitchshifted tones and drum machines with a burbling
    bassline, assorted machine-gun synth interjections, the slightly effected tones
    of various pistons, motors, and machines, and even the occasional cartoon spring
    noise.  Moments like these serve to foreshadow both James' later work, as well as
    the infinitely more complex twists and turns that IDM would make in the years that
    would follow.</p><p>
    They say next to no one heard the Velvet Underground's first album when it was
    released, but everyone who did went on to start a band.  Listening to <i>Selected
    Ambient Works 85-92</i>, one can't help but imagine the seeds being planted in the
    imaginations of the lucky few who were there when it all began. Nestled in these
    simple, undeniably danceable tracks are the roots of contemporary IDM.  And despite
    its somewhat primitive origins, the final product remains among the most interesting
    ever created with a keyboard and a computer.</p></div>"|223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/223-selected-ambient-works-85-92/|9.4|David M. Pecoraro

    With the Mutek and FCMM festival showcasing the city's laptop and post-techno
    artists, the city seems to spawns another star every week.  And this week, it's
    Scott Montieth.  Congratulations, Scott.</p><p>
    
    Deadbeat is the appropriately ambivalent alias Montieth has adopted for
    <i>Primordia</i>, his dub-inspired pop-, crack- and fuzz-matic debut for the
    Intr_Version label.  So why should anyone take any notice of Montieth's
    contribution to a style already bloated beyond sustainability?  Simply: Montieth
    is an accomplished manipulator of sound and a swell storyteller.</p><p>
    
    I approach <i>Primordia</i> in two similar ways: either as a narrative about decay,
    or as an ice-core drill's journey through millennia-old packed ice.  Whether the
    album is actually about radioactive decay or glaciology, I'm not certain.  But
    these have served as useful metaphors and tools by which I have come understand
    and appreciate this seven-track collection. I acknowledge that all of this sounds
    horribly pretentious. But since this music is definitely more oriented for the
    Whitney than prepared for Rick's Roadhouse Bar, I think that I'm meeting Montieth
    head-on.  Like, if he's being intellectual and artistic enough to describe Brownian
    motion or the extent of 180 accumulation the glaciers of Greenland, then I should
    at least attempt to match him.</p><p>
    
    Away from my adopted narrative approaches, <i>Primordia</i>'s seven tracks are
    immensely pixelated versions of Jon Hassell and Brian Eno's <i>Possible Music</i>,
    with units of distortion and fuzz glide and drift much like Hassell's manipulated
    trumpet, and the beats here are similar in that they exist out of any time keeping
    construct. In <i>Possible Music</i>, Nana Vasconcelos and Aiyb Dieng use their
    ghatam (an earthenware pot percussion instrument featured extensively in South
    Indian classical music) and congas to comment on and emulate Hassell's and Eno's
    drifts of sound. Montieth's beats are similarly conversational.</p><p>
    
    But beyond the winking self-effacement of the name Deadbeat, Montieth's moniker
    serves to state that his beats don't function like the ones on dance records. In
    this regard, Montieth's beats are indeed dead.  Yet, in his <i>Primordia</i>,
    Montieth's vision of the pristine state of existence, his beats are very much
    alive and fully functioning-- as much free-floating, uncoalesced entities as his
    fuzzed-out, drifting synths.  While not exactly revolutionary, <i>Primordia</i>
    does have the rare quality of being as malleable and fascinating as the mind of
    whoever's listening.  And that can go a long way.</p></div>"|2219.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2219-primordia/|7.0|Paul Cooper

There's     only one (other) problem: he's losing custody of his seven-year old daughter, Lucy     Diamond Dawson.  From what I've heard about the film-- and I haven't seen it,     because life's too short-- Penn continually quotes Beatles lyrics and tells     anecdotes about the band. So the natural tie-in is a soundtrack album of Beatles     songs.  Of course, licensing the original songs would have been prohibitively     expensive, so in lieu of John, Paul, George and Ringo, this disc features Fab     Four covers by seventeen artists and bands, mostly pooled from contemporary pop     charts and adult alternative radio.</p><p>Because these recordings were made for the film, they can't really be faulted for     sticking pretty closely to the originals and eschewing any wild interpretations.     After all, these bands aren't competing with the Beatles' versions; they're     attempting to replicate the songs in a manner which not only suits the film,     but also remains accessible to the general public.  Not that they're winning any     points with us for that, but it does shed some light on why these songs turned out     the way they did.</p><p>While it's true that many great musicians have recorded powerful and creative     interpretations of this music, the bulk of Beatles covers have been little more     than slavish imitations.  And of course, that's what we end up with here.  Most     of the performers on <em>I Am Sam</em> lean on the Beatles' arrangements and never     bring anything unexpected to the table.  Sarah McLachlan faithfully runs through     ""Blackbird"" on an acoustic guitar; Eddie Vedder echoes the weary tone in Lennon's     voice on ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away""; Ben Harper's performance of     ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" even recreates the song's string section verbatim.</p>
<p>Granted, the Vines' ""I'm Only Sleeping"" manages to radiate a little energy, and     Ben Folds shows up with a pretty take on ""Golden Slumbers"" with strong vocals and     nice orchestration.  But elsewhere, things are pretty dismal.  The Black Crowes'     faithful but dull rendition of ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,"" and the Wallflowers'     middling ""I'm Looking Through You"" are both painfully prosaic.  Chocolate Genius'     reworking of ""Julia"" sounds expensive with its crisp drums, acoustic guitars and     rough vocals, but ultimately comes off plastic.  And Heather Nova (""We Can Work It     Out"") and Sheryl Crow (""Mother Nature's Son"") are just lousy-- they don't even     sing well here.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the one band that actually tried to do something inventive     with any of these songs flops miserably.  Grandaddy's reworking of ""Revolution""     dumbs the melody down to the band's own standards, with Jason Lytle's colorless,     disinterested vocals and extraneous keyboards effects doing little to motivate     listeners to the song's namesake.  A commendable effort, maybe, but still an     ineffective one.</p>
<p>And then there are the highlights.  Aimee Mann and Michael Penn turn in a fair     reading of ""Two of Us,"" with well-crafted production in place of the stripped-down     original.  Rufus Wainwright's ""Across the Universe"" is unremarkable, but at least     brings some conviction and earnestness.  Paul Westerberg and Howie Day play     acoustic versions of ""Nowhere Man"" and ""Help,"" respectively, and the two songs     work well with their back-to-back sequencing.  And unexpectedly, Nick Cave actually     improves upon Paul McCartney's schmaltzy ""Let It Be"" with his understated, sincere     vocals.</p>
<p>Regardless, these more passable moments are far outnumbered by the boring and/or     intolerable ones.  Listeners will probably like (and buy) this soundtrack if they     dig the big-name performers.  All of these artists have their fans-- even Sheryl     Crow-- and if you're one of them, you might enjoy this record.  After all, it does     exactly what it was meant to do.  But with the Beatles, that just doesn't cut it.</p></div>"|7867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7867-i-am-sam-ost/|3.7|Chris Dahlen

Now don't turn around-- something's coming up behind you.
    It's coming closer and closer and closer...""  No, it's not John Ashcroft and his
    Legion of Lawless Thugs, though he might have a question or two for you if you're
    of middle-Eastern descent.  The above sample begins <i>Dancing in the Pockets of
    Thieves</i>.  Warped distortion sounds accelerate, and a disembodied voice croaks,
    ""Not wanting to be found.""  This short intro segues to the brutal rage of ""Cement
    Is Blue.""  It sounds like hardcore punk thrust through an oscillating fan, what
    with the constant clang of the drums and the noxious guitar.  ""My hands are tied
    together,"" frontman Russell White screams over and over, and while the repetition
    gets too barbaric, the tense guitars and humming synth build up and then betray
    with a short ending.</p><p>
    
    Michelle Maskovich and Russell White formed Champagne Kiss (with Jesse Johnson)
    after moving to Minneapolis.  The duo's new band carries on like a continuation
    of their time in San Diego's Camera Obscura, a band that left only one document,
    <i>To Change the Shape of an Envelope</i>, which was rooted in the San Diego
    hardcore scene, yet branched out towards broader influences.  Like fellow
    Diego-dwellers Clikatat Ikatowi Camera Obscura were willing to experiment,
    jamming keyboards, samples and piano into the mix.  Their songs were more
    polished than their kin, and they coupled White's shouts with Maskovich's
    understated backing vocals.  A step in the direction of rock seemed likely.</p><p>
    
    If anything, <i>Dancing in the Pockets of Thieves</i> is even more abrasive.  I'm
    staring at the strange retro fashions on the cover-- all neon lines and angular
    skyscrapers-- and listening to the MIDI beeps and looped crying sounds at the
    beginning of ""Stereo Relapse.""  But then the track busts with a thick seam of
    guitar buzz and White screams about ""plastic consumption"" and ""reflective
    addictions.""  The Roland keyboard bleeps raw melodies, oddly appropriate for the
    seething emotions; the electronics are leveled so ear-splittingly in the mix that
    you barely notice at first that the drums are all programmed.  The aesthetic
    develops into an industrial process, combining remnants of new-wave primitivism
    with post-punk's linear minimalism, and suddenly I'm feeling Reaganite paranoia
    all over again.  ""Monarch Syndicate"" pummels with endless crashes of percussion
    as the guitars mass together and uncoil in screw-loose chaos.</p><p>
    
    Hardcore was a uniquely American reaction to punk and cold war suburbia in the
    1980s-- defiance channeled through raw sonic force, a sense of community and
    brotherhood.  Champagne Kiss offer up just a hint of that affirmation during the
    chorus of ""Black Violin"" as they raise their voices and guitars en masse, voices
    echoing each other awkwardly and shouting, ""This is the last time!""  But then
    White descends into emo diary drama, squealing about ""bleeding diamonds/ Hands
    are screaming/ Voice confessions/ That are bleeding.""  There's this breathy
    voiceover (""Can you hear?"") that sounds like Rozz Williams fucking around on a
    Christian Death b-side.  The problem isn't just the loss of any sense of hope;
    it's that the alternative nihilism doesn't sound as scary as they want it to.
    ""80's Centric"" is the sound of a band lashing out at all that disgusts it but
    tripping over itself.  ""Don't need another hex on my head!"" White yells, and the
    battered drums and shrill synth crescendos sound more campy than creepy.</p><p>
    
    According to the liner notes, <i>Dancing in the Pockets of Thieves</i> was
    recorded in thirty-eight hours.  I wish they'd taken more time.  Their tech
    obsolescence and brittle robotic rhythm is in turns menacing and appealing, but
    this album doesn't contain any one song as amazing as Camera Obscura's
    ""Cinematheque,"" a surging wave of noise counterpointed by Maskovich's faint
    couplets.  ""Deconstructing Genius"" comes the closest, defining the phrase ""synth
    stab"" while the guitar tingles edgily and White whispers, ""Panic-stricken with
    your filled prescriptions.""  Screamed lyrics are buried far back, muted and
    metallic, coming out of some valium-like haze, and after a few minutes of silence
    another section begins full of hyperspeed snares and lonely piano.  The guitars
    play with knife-edge funk, and the band throws in voice samples about a research
    paper on the pharmacological properties of Soma.  Half an hour is too short to
    tease with this kind of acidic commentary, but at least the place they're coming
    from makes sense these days.  Remember all the Americans, shocked at terrorist
    attacks during a time of ""peace?""</p></div>"|1395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1395-dancing-in-the-pockets-of-thieves/|7.3|Christopher Dare

    the target of an oldies campaign.  Given the ever-shortening waiting period for
    nostalgia (hey, man, remember when the Patriots won the Super Bowl?) it's just a
    matter of time before the first ""hits of the 90s"" radio stations start popping up
    across the country.  And when ""Seether"" starts rockin' the airwaves again, you
    better believe Verula Salt will be touring America's low-capacity venues, perhaps
    co-headlining with Ned's Atomic Dustbin and Jesus Jones.</p><p>
    
    Nine years removed from their biggest hits, Cracker would seem to be state-fair
    circuit material themselves.  Yet, to their credit, David Lowery &amp; Co appear
    to be trying their hardest to avoid this fate and remain a vital, relevant act
    with their newest album, <i>Forever</i>.  Of course, when your band's lasting
    image for most people is the lead singer boxing Sandra Bernhard, that's an
    uphill battle to be fighting.</p><p>
    
    Cracker's secret weapon against obscurity, apparently, is to take refuge under
    the roots-rock banner, releasing <i>Forever</i> on the Virgin imprint Back Porch
    Records and wearing a whole lot of denim in the album art.  While perhaps a
    further insult to hardcore Camper Van Beethoven fans desperately praying for
    Lowery to turn around his musical de-evolution, the choice at least reflects a
    purpose more thought out than, ""Hey, remember us?  Please, please, please buy our
    new album!""  But roots-rock itself has always been something of a questionable
    cause, usually implying something along the lines of ""we're tired of experimenting;
    let's just make music that's already been made a thousand times before.""</p><p>
    
    Save a few exceptions, that's mostly the vibe <i>Forever</i> projects, with the
    band (whittled down to a core of Lowery and guitarist Johnny Hickman) content to
    reside along a familiar country-rock-soul axis.  You've got your acoustic guitar
    base, your occasional slide guitar fill, your Dylan-esque organ, your chug-a-lug
    drums, and your mildly catchy melodies.  It would be offensive if it wasn't so
    obvious that Cracker doesn't aspire to much more than this rustic middle-America
    mediocrity act.</p><p>
    
    Or do they?  Mark Linkous returns the favor of Lowery co-writing the brilliant
    Sparklehorse anthem ""Sick of Goodbyes"" by producing the leadoff ""Brides of
    Neptune"" and tweaking Cracker's sound by throwing some eerie synth voices and a
    tinny drum loop into the mix.  And while it's not quite Jim O'Rourke re-inventing
    Wilco, it is a compelling opening to the album.  Hickman's lone solo composition,
    ""Superfan"", also augments the Cracker formula with an underlying drone and some
    ""Baba O'Riley"" violin, indicating that he's more than just Lowery's hired-gun
    soloist.</p><p>
    
    But then again, experimentation also gives us ""What You're Missing"", a self-referential
    joke that painfully allows these Crackers to near-rap about their respective roles
    in the band.  That sound you hear is Biggie rapidly spinning around in his oversized,
    solid-gold coffin.  Humorous intention or no, can we please put a ban on white rock
    bands rapping?</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Lowery's singing voice retains the same old one-dimensional, inflexible
    rasp which, given the uniformity of the music, works more often than not.  Less
    successful are attempts to soften it with two-bit Sheryl Crow-ish harmony/backing
    vocals, which give ""Shine"" and ""Guarded by Monkeys"" a distastefully slick sheen.
    In fact, the album's overall polished countenance doesn't seem to jive with the
    band's supposed rootsy goals.</p><p>
    
    So, no, <i>Forever</i> isn't the album that's going to rescue Cracker from the
    discount used bins and return them to radio prominence, but at the very least,
    it establishes them on the respectable side of the soon-to-be-oldies continuum:
    more our generation's Cheap Trick than our Doobie Brothers.  And something tells
    me that's about all they're shooting for.</p></div>"|1651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1651-forever/|5.4|Rob Mitchum

It's almost funny
    to see this record getting so much deserved attention recently due to its reissue,
    because before now, I only knew a few people who had even heard of the thing. It's
    especially strange to see all the praise in light of Gareth Williams' death on
    Christmas Eve last year.  He wasn't a person who ever really wanted to be famous
    or even known as a musician, and yet will doubtlessly be better known henceforth
    than he'd ever been during This Heat's existence.</p><p>
    
    English drummer/vocalist Charles Hayward (fresh from working with Brian Eno and
    Phil Manzanera in the avant-prog/fusion outfit Quiet Sun) formed This Heat with
    Charles Bullen (guitar, clarinet, viola, etc.) and Williams (bass, keyboards,
    tape manipulation, etc.) around 1975.  Hayward had worked with a fairly broad
    array of jazz and prog bands (and post-This Heat, would continue to do so),
    though Bullen and Williams were much less traveled, even as they were accomplished
    musicians.  Hayward and Bullen had been playing together as a duo for a few years
    prior to This Heat, and began playing with Williams only after Hayward completed
    his duties with Quiet Sun.  Williams would actually leave the band before this
    album, <i>Deceit</i>, was released, and maintain a very busy career as an engineer
    for John Barry and various symphonic recordings.  His interest in recording
    techniques may have provided the impetus for This Heat to experiment with tape
    loops and editing, which would play very large roles in their studio output.</p><p>
    
    This Heat's sound was something like a confrontation of prog, free-jazz and
    contemporary electronic music (think early Stockhausen, not Kraftwerk).  They
    often get lumped into the post-punk (or even just ""punk"") camp, for no better
    reason other than they started at the same time.  They certainly sounded as if
    they were angry about something, and taking a glance at the lyric sheet for this
    album (and you'd better, as often the vocals seem more musical element than
    communicative force), they had fairly intense political/social statements to
    make-- though pinning down their position is often as hard as pinning down their
    sound.  In any case, they were ""progressive"" in the literal sense of the word,
    and though they came up with the first wave of punk, they didn't really sound
    like anyone else of the time (save a few other English radicals like Henry Cow or
    Art Bears, occasionally).</p><p>
<i>Deceit</i> was the band's second and final album (not counting posthumous
    releases, including the excellent BBC session release <i>Made Available</i>).
    As odd as it sounds on the surface, it's actually the more immediately appealing
    of their two albums, at least partially because of a greater emphasis on drive
    and something like song structure (though the music here is quite a ways from
    typical ""songs"").  The vocals-- mostly handled by Hayward-- were probably the
    weakest link for This Heat, though they don't really take away from the music so
    much as push it into yet a stranger realm.</p><p>
    
    ""Sleep,"" the first track, is actually an atypically calm song, almost like a
    fractured lullaby.  Layers of what sound like African percussion, and a simple
    piano line support a very low-key melody, wherein lines like, ""Softness is a
    thing called comfort/ Doesn't cost much to keep in touch/ We never forget you
    have a choice,"" make me wonder if there isn't some kind of subversive commentary
    about consumer ethics and advertising at work.  This shortly leads to the rave-up
    ""Paper Hats"" with its brawny, pouncing rhythms and subtly acrobatic guitar lines.
    This is a piece with several sections, none of them having too much to do with
    each other.  Some, like the lengthy outro, sound like archetypical math-rock,
    with repetitive, complicated rhythmic patterns, while the brief middle section is
    more viscerally dynamic, or perhaps even ""noisy.""  Lyrically, the band was as
    eclectic: ""Well, what do we expect?/ Paper hats?/ Or maybe even roses?/ The sound
    of explosions?/ Oh no.""  I'd like to know what they expected, but I'm not sure
    what they got instead, and am certainly in the dark about to whom they protested.</p><p>
    
    ""Triumph"" is a Dadaist collage of various noises, musical and otherwise.  There's
    a brief accordion intro, leading to what sounds like a kazoo lament accompanied by
    someone scraping a few pieces of metal and wood together.  Then, Hayward mentions
    something about the angles being reversed, and the garbage symphony makes its
    grand conclusion-- all in less than three minutes.  Perhaps this was a prologue
    for ""S.P.Q.R.,"" which throws out any ideas of abstract noodling in favor of pure
    rock expression.  The high-speed beat threatens to overpower a droning duo vocal
    line (""We organize via property as power/ Slavehood and freedom imperial purple/
    Pax Romana!"").  This track doesn't run through a myriad of stylistic changes; it
    makes its case via sheer persistence.</p><p>
    
    Hayward's interest in all manner of world rhythms and percussion manifested itself
    in tracks like ""Shrink Wrap"" and ""Independence"" (words provided by one Thomas
    Jefferson), where kinetic drum orchestras and ancient rain forest flutes and
    strings lent the music an otherworldly quality which further removed it from
    recordings by This Heat's angry peers.  ""Radio Prague"" features more electronic
    trickery, and what sounds like someone actually tuning in and out of a Czech
    radio broadcast.  There's a steady pitter-patter underneath, and some rather dark
    drones in the background (along with a haunting cello), and though I'm tempted to
    say this could have influenced Godspeed You Black Emperor!, it's more likely an
    isolated vignette.  In a way, the entire album seems removed from typical musical
    happenings-- even the underground.  Maybe that's why it's taken so long for
    This Heat to start receiving their due.</p><p>
    
    The band got its digs in once more for ""A New Kind of Water,"" expressing the rage
    that seems to have been implied throughout the record, though rarely shown directly.
    Phrases like, ""We were told to expect more/ And now that we've got more/ We want
    more, we want more,"" offer some of the only clear ideas about the feelings behind
    <i>Deceit</i>, and the music is appropriately insistent (crashing drums, wailing
    group vocals, very precise, discordant guitar lines).  Over the years, there have
    been bands to play as aggressively, or even as strangely, but very few have been
    able to rise from their collective influences and histories to create music so
    singularly distinctive and inspiring.  I don't know that Hayward, Bullen and
    Williams were trying to inspire (and that they debated over whether to release
    their music at all could be evidence to support that they weren't), but the
    overall feeling I take away from this album is that of revolution and a very
    creative form of protest.  That's what I call punk.</p></div>"|8015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8015-deceit/|9.0|Dominique Leone

    quotes John Steinbeck's <i>Travels with Charley</i>.  Steinbeck wrote the book
    after taking a trip across the country, and Annelle's album has a similar feel:
    collecting eleven songs from four years' worth of home recordings, it takes
    snapshots of American scenes.  With their spare tunes and elliptical lyrics,
    Annelle's songs are like pinpricks on a vast map.</p><p>
    
    Amy Annelle has never sung a word she didn't need.  On her solo albums and in her
    work with the Places, she has a perfect sense of how to use silence in her
    recordings-- neither playing faster to fill the quiet, nor slowing down to create
    it.  She recorded <i>A School of Secret Dangers</i> alone, singing and accompanying
    herself on guitar.  Her vocals are the selling point for the album: Annelle has a
    compelling voice that can sound both breathy and grounded, dreamy and rough-- like
    having the bartender sing you a lullaby.</p><p>
    
    And the album sounds great, considering Annelle recorded it to lo-fi four-track.
    The ambience is intimate but wide-open, as if she were camping out in her backyard.
    Silence hangs behind every song, and it's a breathing presence on the quieter
    numbers-- for example, around the low vocals on ""Ugly Stray.""  The only context
    comes from the ""found sound"" between some of the tracks.  Annelle also includes
    recordings of distorted music and talk programs from Christian radio broadcasts.
    Cribbing from backwater religious radio may not be original, but the dislocated
    voices are eerily effective.</p><p>
    
    Compared to the indie pop of her last album, the Places' excellent debut <i>The
    Autopilot Knows You Best</i>, these songs have simpler tunes and stick closer to
    country and folk. ""The Birds Start Talking English,"" the upbeat opener, lopes
    along as Annelle sings about a campfire on a hillside; other songs are more dour,
    such as ""Broke Down,"" about an abandoned cemetery.  The gently catchy melody of
    ""Soft City"" carries a description of a city at night, along with vague information
    about the person who's looking at it.  Annelle challenges herself to make these
    lyrics ambiguous but not meaningless.  She generally succeeds, but the more
    detailed songs have better lines-- check these ones from ""Idaho"": ""We stay up
    all night listening to your grandpa's 78s/ Til the lights begin to glow and
    shadow all the lines on your face.""</p><p>
<i>A School of Secret Dangers</i> requires more attention than the immediately
    likeable <i>Autopilot</i>, but its songs get better with every listen.  Their
    subtlety, when matched with the restraint of Annelle's performance, allow her to
    explore ideas that she can't approach directly.  Annelle implies the emptiness
    around the places she sings about, and the movement of people through wide open
    spaces, listening to half-received radio broadcasts.  And in doing so, she captures
    the sound of being alone.</p></div>"|197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/197-a-school-of-secret-dangers/|7.8|Chris Dahlen

    dance music,"" and both bother me somewhat. They seem to imply that hip-hop and
    dance music are naturally unintelligent styles, and a special provision has to be
    made to distinguish the select few exceptions that break the mold of stupidity.
    And that's not even getting into the vaguely racist connotations the phrase brings
    with it: you don't hear people talking about ""intelligent indie rock"" as a genre
    separate from plain ol' indie rock.</p><p>
    
    I just wanted to wipe the slate clean before applying the phrase to Mike Ladd,
    possibly the brainiest of the latest wave of Ivy League rap. There's a widely
    circulating story that Ladd went to Harvard. He didn't-- he was just born in
    Cambridge, Massachusetts-- but it's revealing that the story is so widely accepted.
    as gospel. He sounds like he went there. Not that Ladd's rhymes possess some kind
    of mindtwisting complexity, but everything he has his hand in radiates
    thoughtfulness and craft.</p><p>
    
    Ladd discovered hip-hop, punk, and poetry at roughly the same time as a kid, so
    he's equally comfortable discussing, or rapping about, Parliament, J. Mascis and
    Langston Hughes. He began his career as a spoken word artist in New York, and his
    words still push the envelope conceptually, but somewhere along the line, he
    learned how to create amazingly textured and funky musical backdrops to accompany
    his words.</p><p>
    
    And actually, they're more than just backdrops on <i>Vernacular Homocide</i>. On
    this seven-song EP, containing half previously released b-sides and half new
    tracks, Ladd's instrumental sketches threaten to upstage his verbal throwdowns.
    ""Poseidon's Reigns,"" for instance, has Ladd welding a ragged-ass drum machine to
    soaring, Fripp-like guitar sear like something from Bowie's Berlin trilogy. Then
    there's ""Music for Tanks,"" sounding like the soundtrack to a Tarkovsky sci-fi
    flick set in the Caribbean.  Both songs are clear highlights you take with you
    long after the words have faded from memory.</p><p>
    
    Of the tracks which offer a taste of Ladd's lyrical skills, the best of the batch
    is the opening track, ""Foxwoods,"" a smoothly flowing antidote to the
    ""no-flow-fo'-hoes"" brand of hip-hop. ""Payback's a bitch,"" Ladd sings, ""even in
    small increments."" Elsewhere, ""The Last Word"" is a spaced-out soul shout-out where
    Ladd raves (seemingly sarcastically), ""Nobody makes money like Mike Ladd makes
    money,"" with operatic backup singers spurring him on. ""Northampton"" is a Mad
    Lib-style, sped-up rant that sounds like a five-year-old singing James Brown,
    and it sits in sharp contrast to the final track: a sober, unaccompanied poem
    about Ladd's mother, or more specifically, about her age. ""If I tell my mother's
    age, I'll never be forgiven,"" Ladd speaks slowly and deliberately. ""St. Peter will
    look at me with those horrible, cascading eyes like a woman from the ice storm.""</p><p>
<i>Vernacular Homocide</i> is a quick and powerful dose of what makes Mike Ladd
    someone to keep an eye one: great lyrics that never try to be witty (they simply
    <i>are</i>) and rarely reveal themselves immediately, and an amazing stylistic
    breadth, from semi-comedic rap to what you could call singer/songwriter hip-hop.
    His two full-lengths are also great, but can be a bit overwhelming. This disc
    might be a better place for the uninitiated to sample Ladd's lyrical prowess and
    sound manipulation wizardry.</p></div>"|4622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4622-vernacular-homocide-ep/|7.5|Jason Nickey

    with a live-music deficiency, but around late '98, I was one of the few diagnosed
    with this ailment.  Although the condition is severe, it can be easily remedied
    within a good 14-16 months (or one Les Savy Fav show, whichever comes first). As
    the treatment-- which consists, unsurprisingly, of going to shows-- progressed, I
    began donning a host of new traits and characteristics, all symptomatic of my
    burgeoning addiction to the spectacle of live performance, an insatiable mistress
    that will leave you penniless and in the gutter if not carefully restrained (or
    so I'm told).  Restraint, however, is something I've yet to exhibit.</p><p>
    
    You see, when the Polyphonic Spree came through town opening for headlining
    heavyweights Built to Spill, my pocketbook told me not to go. Actually, my
    pocketbook and an invoice from Wells Fargo were both fighting to dissuade me from
    blowing my last $15 on such an obvious one-night stand. But anyone will tell you
    that the call of Doug Martsch is not to be ignored, even if he is touring in
    support of a mediocre album. So with high spirits and a slightly altered dieting
    plan for the proceeding month, I bought the ticket and took the ride.</p><p>
    
    Having had no formal experience with the Polyphonic Spree, I ignorantly deduced
    from the name that I was in for about an hour of freely traded rhymes about pop
    culture and sneakers, the way the Sugarhill Gang used to drop it, while 25 figures
    clad in nothing but unkempt white robes and Cheshire-cat smiles slowly lumbered
    onto the stage. As my eyes discerned the familiar form of ex-Tripping Daisy
    frontman Tim DeLaughter, my first inclination was to scale the four-foot protective
    barricade that acted as the group's metallic moat and shake him vigorously in an
    effort to deprogram the fallen Texas auteur. But as I stood there, waiting for a
    vat of Kool-Aid-flavored cyanide to make its appearance and confirm my deepest,
    darkest fears, I began to notice the song that was stirring to life on stage.</p><p>
    
    What ensued was a revivalist get-down that would put any Episcopalian minister to
    shame. DeLaughter's warbling vocals, unwavering heavenward gaze, and beaming smile
    seemed to speak for the entire group (which consists of two percussionists, a
    choir, and a theremin player, amongst others). In fact, the evening could have
    easily found the Polyphonic Spree upstaging any number of lesser headliners, were
    they not Built to Spill. So then why does this, the Spree's first album, released
    on DeLaughter's own Good Records label, seem so... unimaginative?</p><p>
    
    As it stands, the Polyphonic Spree are the musical approximation of saccharin, in
    that they make a great substitute for pure, unadulterated twee.  But, also like
    saccharin, they are possibly cancerous in heavy doses.  The more anthemic
    crowd-pleasing numbers littered throughout <i>The Beginning Stages of the
    Polyphonic Spree</i> boast such endlessly repeated refrains as ""Hey/ It's the Sun/
    And it makes me Shine,"" which lose a lot of their appeal when taken out of their
    natural habitat (the live setting) and placed between your headphones. In the end,
    the experience becomes less like our generation's ""Takin' Care of Business"" and
    more like those fireside sing-alongs you were coerced into participating in at
    summer camp.</p><p>
    
    The album, comprised of 10 ""sections,"" chronicles a group whose only precedents
    are the familiar melodies of lazy 1970s AM radio and inspirational religious cable
    TV programming. Luckily, though, the group has an unrealized experimental side
    which can be attributed with some of the album's most exciting moments and one
    the disc's best songs (""Section 4""). But for every risk taken, there's a
    counterproductive indulgence. A good example of this is ""Section 3,"" which begins
    as a stunning meditation on guitar and viola before suddenly being overwhelmed by
    pan flutes and self-parodying chimes.  I mean it when I say that it's the best
    ballad John Stamos has done since he covered the Beach Boys' ""Forever.""</p><p>
<i>The Beginning Stages</i>, sadly, never approaches anything greater than novelty.
    Given the fact that the Polyphonic Spree are a self-proclaimed ""choral symphonic
    pop band,"" most songs come off like mid-70s Todd Rundgren (ouch!) with multi-tracked
    vocal harmonies. The premise for the group is admittedly genius, but if DeLaughter's
    goal is to distill their stage presence and the giddiness conjured at Spree
    performances onto compact disc, he and his Polyphonic friends will have to find
    a way to work around their music's seemingly necessary visual accompaniment.</p></div>"|6394.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6394-the-beginning-stages-of/|6.1|Kevin Adickes

Does modern techno feel like a soft blow to
    your skull?  There used to be a better way.  London's Soul Jazz Records has released
    <i>In the Beginning There Was Rhythm</i>, a compilation of British post-punk bands,
    including the Slits, Gang of Four, Throbbing Gristle, and Cabaret Voltaire.  We're
    talking about drums and wires, knife-sharp scratchy rhythm guitar, crappy synths,
    and veteran funk and reggae horns.  We're talking men shouting political slogans
    and naked women covered in mud.  And while this music sounds old, it sure as hell
    isn't dated-- this stuff is primal, made by people who were finding new ways to
    channel the brute instinct that first drove man to bang animal skins with sticks.</p><p>
    
    These songs came out of the bleak setting of industrial England in the late 70s
    and early 80s.  The Thatcher administration came into power, and skinheads and
    members of the National Right roamed the streets.  Against this climate, bands
    emerged from the inner city melting pots embodying a new racial, sexual, and
    musical diversity.  DJs spun reggae records at punk shows.  Tape loops and
    synthesizers joined the guitar as lead instruments.  Funk, dub, and experimental
    music were bigger influences than the Velvet Underground or ""Iggy Fucking Pop""
    (to quote A Certain Ratio's Simon Topping), and all-girl and multiracial bands
    introduced new ideas to the ""white boys, three chords and an attitude"" world of
    pop.</p><p>
    
    Every track on this album cooks with the excitement of musicians trying new things.
    For their ""Coup"" single, 23 Skidoo were joined by a star funk bassist and horn
    section.  Then, once they had an unstoppable dance track, they piled on sound
    effects of breaking glass and guns firing-- just because it sounds cool.  At the
    brainier end of the scale, the shamefully obscure This Heat manufactured ""24 Track
    Loop"" with just a tape loop and a mixing board, huddling in the studio that they'd
    made from a converted meat locker.  They crib from dub and the avant-garde, but
    more important, ""24 Track Loop"" is a sick little number with a fast beat and a
    terrifically abrasive sound that comes off absolutely modern.</p><p>
    
    There are also straight-up guitar bands, which combined left-wing politics with
    ass-shaking rhythm sections.  The Pop Group's ""She Is Beyond Good and Evil""-- one
    of their most infectious singles-- appears here, with its bone marrow guitars and
    Mark Stewart's guttural swagger, ""Western values mean nothing to her.""  Reggae
    veteran Dennis Bovell, who also produced albums for the Slits, adds effects that
    make it sound monstrously vast.  Gang of Four, who played legendary tours in the
    States, tear through ""To Hell With Poverty,"" singing, ""Some are insane and they're
    in charge,"" over heavy drums and jagged, searing guitars.  This single alone makes
    everything Rage Against the Machine has ever aspired to redundant.  Less aggressive
    and more off-kilter, the Slits contribute the title song, ""In the Beginning There
    Was Rhythm."" Ari Up's untrained voice mutters, needles and bellows the lyrics; a
    little warbly and massively expressive, she's in top form on this track.</p><p>
    
    You could almost call this compilation ""eclectic,"" but that's too quaint a word
    for music that punches you in the gut.  The bands are diverse but every song has
    a killer beat that sells the political lyrics and grounds the experimentation.
    Whatever the methods and whoever's in the line-up, every band here understands
    that fundamental, deep-as-your-soul rhythm: like Ari Up sings, ""God says you will
    <i>dance</i>.""</p><p>
    
    If there's anything's wrong with the disc, it's that it's too short; the story of
    post-punk could take up several box sets.  The disc comes with 35 pages of liner
    notes, but the record itself doesn't tell a story or connect the songs.  Many
    bands got left out, and it would also be interesting to hear how the bands
    developed-- for example, to watch the early Human League with its craptronic
    keyboards and all-guy line-up grow into the band that created the synth-pop
    masterpiece <i>Dare</i>.  But the problem with big anthologies is that they
    inevitably use tracks that are important but aren't fun.  <i>In the Beginning</i>,
    on the other hand, doesn't have a single limp tune.  It'll amaze new listeners
    and give old ones some hard-to-find tracks.  Buy it.</p></div>"|1991.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1991-in-the-beginning-there-was-rhythm/|9.3|Chris Dahlen

They gave
    him a horn; he blew in the wrong end. They gave him a guitar; he made feedback.
    They sat him at a piano; he opened it up and plucked at the chords. So discouraged
    was little Timmy by the taunts of his peers that one day, he gave up playing music
    altogether.  Then, one sunny afternoon, he stumbled upon a record by this guy
    named Fog.  Fog didn't necessarily play his instruments right, either.</p><p>
    
    Sure, Timmy had heard people scratching records, but he'd never heard anyone doing
    it like this. It was strange, almost haphazard in a way. The music fell somewhere
    in between Christian Marclay and Kid Koala-- more a collage of strange sounds
    sometimes set to guitar or bass than the rhythm-happy scratchfests that comprise
    most traditional DJ records. Fog seemed more interested in seeing how many strange
    sounds he could make with his turntables than in keeping a rhythm or showboating.
    And yet, there was something to the chaos that sounded totally planned, completely
    sculpted.  Timmy was amazed to hear someone show the same utter disregard for
    convention his very classmates had convinced him was so wrong.</p><p>
    
    Fog became a catalyst for Timmy. He soon realized that there was no such thing as
    ""a right way"" to play an instrument, and that there were others out there who
    believed this, too.  Soon he would discover other turntable wizards-- folks like
    Christian Marclay and Otomo Yoshihide-- and he grew even more awestruck. A year
    later, little Timmy, slightly less little and much less melancholy, found himself
    surrounded by strange albums, and had even taken up the turntable himself. True,
    Fog wasn't quite so amazing now that he'd heard all these other turntablists, but
    it still had its moments and he certainly couldn't deny that it played the role of
    catalyst in his life, or that it was-- in many ways-- responsible for his trajectory.</p><p>
    
    But enough about Timmy; let's talk about Fog (aka Andrew Broder), a young Minnesotan
    who grew up, in fact, only a few miles away from Pitchfork's esteemed editor. But
    while Schreiber was learning to pitch the fork, Broder was no doubt hiding away in
    a nearby suburban bedroom, destroying records, fooling around with turntables in
    the dark, and following the call of his muse, no matter how strange that call
    might have been.</p><p>
    
    As an avant-gardist, Broder's music is solid-- nothing revolutionary, perhaps, but
    solid.  Where Broder truly shines is in his understanding of pop, and in the way
    he makes it fit so snugly with his more left-field musings.  Take the decidedly
    poppy ""Pneumonia,"" for example. The track starts out sounding like another in a
    long line of Neutral Milk Hotel imposters, with distorted fuzz bass, a simple
    acoustic guitar melody, vocals that teeter dangerously on the edge that separates
    grating from sensitive, and weird ghostly theremin-like noises hovering ominously
    in the background. But rest assured, it's only Broder and his turntable. He's also
    keeping the beat with a looped, gently scratched drum sample. But it's when the
    song reaches its instrumental interlude that Broder really shines, busting out a
    stunning turntable solo that sounds more like a harmonica or a guitar than a
    record player.</p><p>
    
    The technique he's using at this point is actually rather minimal-- using records
    with just one flat tone, allowing it to play on its own more often than he
    manipulates it. Even then, it's just a quick scratch here and there, and a pitch
    adjust before he allows it to play again. Still, simple is not synonymous with
    ineffective or unoriginal. The sound works. Indeed, it's Broder's willingness to
    give in to his pop sensibilities that make <i>Fog</i> work so well.</p><p>
    
    ""Truth and Laughing Gas"" opens as one of the more straightforward tracks on the
    album, with thrashing guitar, distorted bass, ominous synths and frenzied hip-hop
    scratching.  But as the song progresses, the guitar falls away and the scratching
    grows more and more abstract, eventually giving way to an exercise in ambience.
    ""Hitting a Wall"" begins like Ween or vintage Beck, replete with heavily treated
    wobbly vocals, purposely sloppy guitar and well-placed scratches. But every so
    often, Broder's turntable takes over, as if possessed, letting the song fall by
    the wayside as he presents a barrage of strange noises. Ultimately, Broder allows
    bits and pieces of crackly old folk records to fall into the collage, and manipulates
    and contrasts them with feedback-laden guitar that brings us back to the song's
    opening.  Broder restrains himself on ""Glory,"" layering violins and little bells
    underneath his manipulated percussion samples as cLOUDDEAD's Dose One weaves vocal
    digressions in and out, nothing more than another element of the atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    If the poppy aspects of some of Fog's songs end up alienating some stuck-up,
    by-the-book avant-gardists, then so be it. Because it's Broder's careful balancing
    act between the traditional and the abnormal that makes his music so interesting.
    And if anything, the album's more traditional moments will serve as a jump-on
    point for those who'd never think to check out something like ""experimental
    turntablism."" It's here that Broder will succeed where many of his brethren fail--
    not only is he creating innovative music; he's making an effort to expand its
    audience as well.</p></div>"|3129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3129-fog/|8.3|David M. Pecoraro

What does the PA stand for? Preppie Anarchist? Pretentious
    Asshole?  Paranoid Agoraphobic?  Popular Arboretum?  Partially Anesthetized?
    Physician's Assistant?</p><p>
    
    Wrong.  The PA only stands for Pennsylvania, a rather dull reason to put mysterious
    letters behind one's name. Not that Pennsylvania is a dull state. Why, without
    Pennsylvania, we wouldn't have Rolling Rock, the Phillies (hands down, the best
    logo font in sports), and the Constitution.  And even though Pennsylvania's the
    only state in which I've ever received a speeding ticket, I don't hold a grudge.</p><p>
    
    That may change, however, if I have to keep listening to Matt Pond PA's <i>The
    Green Fury</i>. <i>The Green Fury</i> = ungood. I don't like it. Boo.</p><p>
    
    The setup behind MPPA is not innately flawed: a melancholy singer/songwriter
    fleshing out his songs with soaring orchestral arrangements. Some call it
    chamber-pop, and bands like the Flaming Lips or Mercury Rev pull it off to great
    effect. Matt Pond PA, on the other hand, is a bit heavy on the chamber and way
    too light on the pop (not to mention light on the Dave Fridmann, but that can't
    be helped). Rather than adding depth and creativity, the various strings, horns,
    keyboards, and vibraphones are all seemingly used to disguise the tepid songs
    within-- an extravagantly wrapped Christmas present with socks and underwear
    inside.</p><p>
    
    The blame, therefore, would have to fall squarely on bandleader/songwriter Pond's
    slumped shoulders. Pond seems to have a knack for writing languid, generic tracks
    that have all the pop of soggy Rice Krispies.  It all depends on your definition,
    though.  If ""pop"" for you means instantly catchy, hummable tunes, you certainly
    won't find it here.  But if ""pop"" means boring verse-chorus-verse song structure,
    hey, Matt has you covered.  As for covering, I'll do my own with a blanket and
    this CD.</p><p>
    
    Worst of all, there's the more-than-passing resemblance Pond's voice bears to
    mid-90's frat-house poet Adam Duritz. Pond shares Duritz's habit for introspective
    warbling, with his vocals cracking oh-so-dramatically in the upper registers. Once
    you realize this similarity, there's really no going back.  The unsurprising result
    is a textbook case of excessive emoting.  Throw in Pond's heavy-handed way with a
    lyric, and I'm inclined to think him and Duritz are the same person until proven
    otherwise.</p><p>
    
    Without Pond's tremulous yearning, a handful of the songs (""Measure 3,"" ""Promise
    the Bite"") might have been enjoyable in an ""aging indie rocker sitting on the
    porch with a glass of Merlot and a David Foster Wallace novel"" sort of way.  Still,
    the many, many string parts don't do anything on <i>The Green Fury</i> you haven't
    heard a hundred times before, even if they are well-executed from a technical
    standpoint.  Other instruments aren't so lucky, though: the french horn solo of
    ""Jefferson"" will surely make Pitchfork's list of Worst French Horn Solos Ever
    (coming soon!) and I think the last of my patience with the vibraphone was worn
    down by the record's sixth track.</p><p>
    
    I suppose there are a few other nice things I can say about <i>The Green Fury</i>.
    The album cover has a nice green-and-yellow plaid pattern on it, for instance,
    that I wouldn't mind owning in couch or pants form.  I'll award the band bonus
    points for cleverly releasing a preview EP last year called <i>This is Not the
    Green Fury</i>. And someday, I may likely use Matt Pond PA as proof in an argument
    over whether independent music is inherently better than major label releases. But
    other than that, Matt Pond PA is just an easy target for wise-ass negative blurbs.
    What do you like better: ""No, Mr. Pond, I expect you to die!!!"" or ""This Pond
    could use a good de-scumming!!!""?</p></div>"|5155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5155-the-green-fury/|1.8|Rob Mitchum

    the female Marshall Mathers.  Her tongue is far more whiplash, and in terms of
    panache, she got Detroit's trailer park provocateur beaten by a mile.  Plus, she's
    the mistress of her own destiny (not another Dre pawn); her previous releases came
    out bearing the manufacturing stamps of her own stridently anti-corporate A Big Rich
    Major Label and Corrupt Conglomerate outfits.</p><p>
<i>Princess Superstar Is</i> is the follow-up to 2000's <i>Last of the Great
    Twentieth-Century Composers</i>, and her transition from self-releasing material
    to signing with !K7's hip-hop offshoot Rapster will ensure her broader distribution.
    Which means that all of us who aren't prowling Manhattan's East Village for white
    labels will have the pleasure of the Princess' company.</p><p>
    
    This album is, as you'd expect from such a title, is collection of beat-down
    statements about who Princess Superstar is.  She's as rapidly keen to distance
    herself from the idea that she's some producer's dolly as she would be to distance
    herself from someone with scabies. So ""Who Writes Your Lyrics"" is an assault
    weapon rhyme: ""Son of Sam? I'm the daughter of Sam/ Slaughter a man on the
    microphone/ Pardon me, ma'am, was that part of a man or your son I just whipped
    on the mic and sent home?"" Princess reinforces those homicidal statements with
    more operational ones: ""So I'm a girl, yeah, I'm white and I write all night with
    a bare swingin' light/ On the computer, alright?  A producer, alright?  I produced
    this song/ So you know who you are, you know you were wrong/ No, I was not in that
    porn <i>On Golden Blonde</i>/ Got it goin' on, more James Bond than Sean John.""</p><p>
    
    Not only is Princess Superstar all about eliminating any mis/preconceptions about
    her being a white chick in hip-hop, but she's also gagging to emasculate the style,
    too. In ""Keith 'N' Me,"" her duet with the Spankmaster himself, Superstar leaves
    Kool Keith panting and blue-balled. In a star-struck moment, she mutters, ""I gotta
    call my moms, tell her Keith's on my song/ Ultramagnetic you helped my headache
    like a music paramedic/ You mad athletic, there I said it."" Then she regains her
    brash senses and returns to her rhyming Samantha Jones self, reducing Keith's dick
    to soft-serve.</p><p>
    
    On ""Bad Babysitter,"" Superstar satirizes what people think of her, playing the
    craven teenager to the hilt:</p><p>
    
    ""Babysitting sucks but whatever<br/>
    They got junk food, kung fu, egg fu, Dig Dug, a dog, too<br/>
    And a hot Jew, Mr. Weintraub, I mean he's old but not dimed out<br/>
    If I'm bad I'll turn around in the corner for time out<br/>
    Aiight, Josh, what you wanna do?  You wanna watch cartoons?<br/><i>Platoon</i>, hey get back in the room!<br/>
    I assume your folks are gonna be out late, go make me Kool Aid<br/>
    I'm a sit on the couch and masturbate<br/>
    Then call my boyfriend Gabe and see if he ate<br/>
    Spit out my Bubbalicious and get to one of them<br/>
    Big fridges that could fit 10 midgets<br/>
    Damn, they're rich, hey, she left me fifty dishes<br/>
    Bitch!""</p><p>
    
    With ""We Got Panache,"" Princess Superstar outlines her materialistic goals before
    stating that, no matter what, she's going to party:</p><p>
    
    ""It's ironic how erotic my robotic sonnets<br/>
    Get girls in bonnets hot like Harry Connicks<br/>
    Sick on gin and tonics, we super sonic, hook you on our phonics<br/>
    Learned Ebonics by erotic ebony dick and Mantronix<br/>
    Never stoppin' it, sock electronic shit allotted<br/>
    The whole club up when we spotted it<br/>
    And if we wanted it, fill it with men and spawn and shit<br/>
    Ain't nothing wrong with it<br/>
    Let's get the party started, shit, let's get it on and hit.""</p><p>
    
    As a hedonist's manifesto, this has decidedly more Fifth Avenue elan than Andrew
    W.K.'s pre-literate cave-dweller grunts.</p><p>
    
    Though the album showcases lyrical dexterity and directness, the beats that frame
    them are less finessed. Perhaps the Princess' desire to be perceived as a unique
    talent has led her to resist mimicking flavor-of-the-month production for a more
    generic post-Native Tongues sound.  Though it's too much to ask that she team up
    with any of Mille Plateaux's click-hop artists, I'd love to hear this album
    produced by Vladislav Delay or Kid 606, on the evidence of his reworkings of
    Missy Elliott. That album would be truly amazing.</p><p>
    
    Having worked for seven or so years in the Manhattan hip-hop community, Princess
    Superstar is not out to amaze. She wants to get paid and she deserves to. But
    she's going to be in a precarious position if she's going to become more than a
    nominal superstar. As well as avoiding becoming a peripheral loudmouth skeeze for
    some aspiring Roc-A-Fella, she needs to avoid settling for dueting with Gwen
    Stefani when she should be guesting with Le Tigre.  The Princess has, without
    question, the talent, the wit and the sass to live up to her alias. This record
    is certainly not the masterpiece I believe she's capable of, but rather, a clear
    premonition of such an album.</p></div>"|6483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6483-princess-superstar-is/|8.0|Paul Cooper

    theme. Rather than slapping together a bunch of cast-offs haphazardly, Deluxe's
    Mike Martinez commissioned tracks-- some by Deluxe artists, some not-- that relate
    in some way to the nocturnal. In addition to reflecting the nighttime premise,
    most of the artists here approach electronic music from the glitch/click/cut
    angle, lending further textural continuity to the compilation.</p><p>
    
    That said, one man's continuity is another's redundancy, and there's no doubting
    that if you're growing tired of glitches, you will not enjoy <i>Night Owls 01</i>.
    This sort of sound is everywhere in electronic music these days, and a few of these
    tracks seem nothing more than indistinct IDM with a few fashionable signifiers.
    To ignore the compilation as a whole because of a handful of dull tracks would
    be a mistake, though, because there's some exceptional work happening here.  And
    despite the similarities in approach and sound, it's not hard to tell where the
    real talent lies on <i>Night Owls 01</i>.</p><p>
    
    For starters, you have to look to label boss Mike Martinez. He contributes two
    tracks: one in collaboration with visual artists and designer Jon Santos (whom
    he works with as Parts:places), the other under his familiar Electric Birds guise.
    The Parts:places track, ""Untitled No. 8,"" is a standout, a brilliant sheen of
    subaquatic drone and throbbing feedback sprinkled gently with evocative clicks
    and glitches. It actually sounds more like Electric Birds than the Electric Birds
    track ""Autofibre,"" in which assorted bell-like tones are processed and split apart
    before the tune develops into a quivering mediation on two organ chords, complete
    with relaxed drum programming.</p><p>
    
    Also skilled is Finnish newcomer Esa Ruoho, whose two exceptional tracks mark him
    as a producer to watch. The bass bubbles of ""Molies 1"" feel dark and cold, with a
    high-end roll-off conjuring the arctic breeze Alec Empire cultivated on his <i>Low
    on Ice</i> release. More impressive still is ""Molies 2,"" which feels like midnight
    in the oil-soaked field behind the abandoned screw machine shop. The sounds of
    strange chattering creatures are mixed with a hum that seems sampled from a slowly
    creaking weathervane, helping make the track genuinely scary.</p><p>
    
    Deluxe artist Eblake contributes the similar and equally strong ""Nachtmusik,"" a
    track that would have been the best cut his debut record. Clanking metal, vague
    splashing sounds and deep organ chords give the piece the feel of a three a.m.
    film noir scene. The final highlight is by little-known French producer Aspic, a
    feast of Microstoria-style botched transmissions, the sound of an amplified tap
    on a massive phone network fed through a delay machine.</p><p>
    
    The above is the good stuff, and the remainder of <i>Night Owls 01</i> is not so
    much bad as indistinct. The tracks in between the standouts do little to draw
    attention to themselves, and instead seem to serve as lengthy bridges between
    the peaks. Overall, <i>Night Owls 01</i> makes for a good front-to-back listen
    and effective background music.  Just be sure to pull yourself from your book at
    the first sound of something exceptional.</p></div>"|1875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1875-night-owls-01/|6.5|Mark Richard-San

    thought it high time to let Mirah in on some action, too.  You see, besides
    appearing on just about every Microphones release so far, Mirah (full name Mirah
    Yom Tov Zeitlyn) released an excellent collection of songs in 2000 called <i>You
    Think It's Like This but Really It's Like This</i>, which was produced by lead
    Microphone Phil Elvrum.  And she's issued enough singles and comp tracks over the
    past couple of years to choke all of Calvin Johnson's kittens.</p><p>
    Now, gearing up for her sophomore full-length, Mirah drops a nice little EP on us
    called <i>Cold Cold Water</i>. When I first heard the title, the sick part of me
    was hoping for a cover version of the old country standard popularized by classic
    cowboy balladeer Marty Robbins.  Such was not the case, but the title track does
    evoke Robbins in a strange way. It's a bombastic gunfighter ballad (of sorts),
    coming off not entirely unlike Björk on peyote having visions of the Old West.</p><p>
    And you'd think it was all completely tongue-in-cheek judging from the cover art,
    which depicts Mirah as a masked outlaw, ready to fire her handgun at who knows
    what evil, off-cover menace.  Yet, taken on its own, the song is deadly serious,
    dark, and full of the kind of not-so vague sexual innuendos we've come to expect
    from Mirah. It starts with the lines, ""I saddled up my pony right and rode into
    the ghostly night/ It was wide, wide open,"" accompanied by a simple guitar strum.
    Then, Phil Elvrum's panoramic, Morricone-esque production technique explodes onto
    the soundstage with swelling strings, huge crashing cymbals, mammoth tympani, and
    strikingly effective hoof-clopping sounds. Meanwhile, Mirah sings about (as far
    as I can tell) finding a lover and taking him away to ""where the water's deep"" to
    ""make the air you breath so sweet.""  It gets kinda vague from there, but it's the
    discrepancy between Mirah's voice, which is intimacy incarnate, and the sweeping
    grandeur of the production and backing music that makes the song truly affecting.
    The dynamic creates a complex but beautiful irony that's intoxicating.</p><p>
    After the title track, there are three songs of admirable bedroom folk, played
    solo and recorded by Calvin Johnson (including a unadorned version of ""Cold Cold
    Water""). Then, there's eight tracks of ""excerpts"": snippets from the Elvrum-enhanced
    title track singled out.  First, the string section is heard all by itself, then
    guitar and background vocals, then drums and percussion, and so on. And it's
    amazing how a close listen to these snippets alter how you listen to ""Cold Cold
    Water""; you hear all these little parts you missed the first time around.  It
    turns the EP into more of a participatory experience, and it's an interesting
    way to fill up an EP without resorting to b-material, keeping focus on the main
    song and enhancing the experience of listening to it.</p><p>
    I'm not giving Elvrum all the credit here-- the songs are what hold the EP
    together-- but this kid is a genius when it comes to recorded sound.  And
    judging from the sound of the EP's title track, he's put a lot more time and
    effort into the recording process of Mirah's forthcoming album, <i>Advisory
    Committee</i>, than he did for <i>You Think It's Like This</i>.  With any luck,
    it will be Mirah's first exceptional release.</p></div>"|5328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5328-cold-cold-water-ep/|8.2|Jason Nickey

From disaster porn to Lifetime
    movies, our culture loves to vicariously exorcise their diminutive traumas through
    those whose lives have been wrought with pain. This carries over to the world of
    music where the dynamic between tragedy and reverence is exalted, rather than
    critiqued, and personified by such talents as Nick Drake, Tim Buckley, Johnny Ace
    and, more recently, Mark Sandman. The macabre tales and images of their
    self-destruction are indelibly linked to the bodies of work they left behind,
    forever blurring the lines that separate an impartial assessment of their talents
    from the content of their character.</p><p>
    
    The truth is that the music of those who burn
    out isn't necessarily judged by a different set of standards so much as it's
    judged by the standards the artists set for themselves during their creative
    zeniths. After all, these modern legends posthumously govern a world where rumors
    and hearsay reach mythical proportions and idolaters devote their entire lives to
    collecting every shred of sound their own personal God/Goddess ever committed to
    tape.</p><p>
    
    ""Syd"" Roger Barrett is one of those golden calves, though fashioned by a much
    different maker. The infamous story of his rise to the forefront of the burgeoning
    British psychedelic scene in the late 60s-- for those of you not up on your Syd,
    he was the premier singer/songwriter of Pink Floyd that fell into a drug-induced
    mania catalyzed by already-prevalent schizophrenic conditions-- has been reiterated,
    exaggerated, invoked, and novelized so many times that it's arguably overshadowed
    his seminal contributions to popular music.  These contributions-- his two solo
    albums, <i>The Madcap Laughs</i> and <i>Barrett</i>, both released in 1970--
    transcend his work with late-60s Pink Floyd and make for haunting aural documents
    of a prolific talent's dilapidating psyche while paradoxically managing to retain
    a rich charm and hooks sharp enough to make Peter Pan wet his tights.</p><p>
    
    Discounting a few independently distributed releases and <i>Cleopatra's Octopus</i>,
    no serious attempt has ever been made to compile the ""best of"" Syd Barrett, let
    alone to confine the content to his solo material. This may be partially due to
    the Herculean nature of the task.  Though the Madcap's output as a solo artist
    only adds up to roughly 45 songs (22 of which are contained here), it would be
    easy for the compiler to fail in their intention, given Syd's penchant for an
    enduring arrangement and melody.</p><p>
    
    The release of Capitol's <i>Wouldn't You Miss Me</i>, which draws from every facet
    of Barrett's available recorded output, is certainly no exception, notably omitting
    ""No Man's Land,"" a common fan favorite, and the stark acoustic demo of ""Rats,""
    which is home to some of Barrett's most self-effacing (and successful)
    stream-of-consciousness, and was originally released with fuller instrumentation
    on <i>Barrett</i> before finding its way onto <i>Opel</i>, a collection of rarities
    and outtakes. Regardless, the collection itself is a long overdue acknowledgment
    of the disarming beauty found in Syd's work outside the psychedelic stratum.</p></div>"|568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/568-wouldnt-you-miss-me-the-best-of/|8.5|Kevin Adickes

    between the capable flow of MCs Mikah 9, Self Jupiter, Aceyalone and P.E.A.C.E.
    None of them sound simply like role-players; each has skills enough to carry an
    album (and each one of them has). And yet, for one reason or another, they
    continue to step out of their personal spotlights to contribute to this posse.
    It's worked well in the past.</p><p>
<i>""Your dog will quickly learn to recognize his music for his Freestyle.  You'll
    see a new sparkle in his eye, feet stepping higher and a tail wagging harder. A
    new star is born.""  --From the article ""Getting Started with Canine Freestyle,""
    by Alison Jaskiewicz</i></p><p>
    
    The Freestyle Fellowship caught on to the game quickly. Before even signing to a
    label, the Fellowship owned the L.A. underground scene with bootlegged copies of
    their 1991 deeper-than-underground debut, <i>To Whom It May Concern</i>. They
    followed it up with an acknowledged underground masterpiece, <i>Inner City Griots</i>,
    in 1993.  <i>Griots</i> displayed the ample MC skills of the posse-- boisterous,
    urgent, energetic, and playful. A new star was born.</p><p>
    
    In the eight years hence, however, it looks like the acclaim's gone to their
    collective heads.  As I see it, the Rhyming Confidence Spectrum (RCS) begins at
    ""cocky"" and runs all the way to ""delusions of Godhood.""  In other words, all MCs
    start out cocky.  And cocky is good-- you want a cocky MC.  Then, with acclaim,
    some get fatter in the cranium, believing themselves ""enlightened"" (<i>see Common,
    Q-Tip</i>), and in the most severe cases, become convinced of their own divinity
    (<i>see Rakim, Jay Z</i>). Unfortunately, delusions of Godhood, when not actually
    accompanied by lyrical Godhood, merely spell complacency.  With no chip on his
    shoulder, the MC thinks he's so good that he no longer even bothers to prove it.</p><p>
    
    And on <i>Temptations</i>, the ego trip is intolerable.  One especially contrived
    example comes with ""Fragrance,"" a poetry number based on random vibraphones and
    guest rapper Abstract Rude going overboard with nonsense cliches like, ""Scattered
    thoughts of our battered love to its bloody pulp fiction was Tarantino-esque.
    Ghetto Juliette!""  On other tracks, the guys simply sound older and more complacent,
    unlike on <i>Inner City Griots</i>, when their youthful exuberance might have even
    been construed as showing off.  But when an MC has the flow of Aceyalone or Mikah
    9, you <i>want</i> him to show off.  These moments are too rare on <i>Temptations</i>.</p><p>
<i>""Do I have to dance?  No, emphatically no!  But, yes, you may."" --From the
    article ""Canine Freestyle: Do I Have to Dance?"" by Alison Jaskiewicz</i></p><p>
    
    Do I have to dance to this album? No, emphatically no! But yes, I suppose dancing
    to <i>Temptations</i> is possible (maybe even with your ""bitch,"" if your dog is a
    girl).  The beats on <i>Temptations</i> truly sound like freestyle beats, as if
    producer Josef Leimberg had them pre-loaded on his keyboard since 1993, just
    in case the Fellowship ever decided to show up to the studio.  I mean, <i>Inner
    City Griots</i>'s background was never considered especially fresh, but there was
    charm in those basic beats-- they always seemed so practical, never trying to
    impress or steal the show from the main attraction.  On <i>Temptations</i>, the
    shit comes off like the ""street"" preset blaring from some imitation Casio keyboard
    in the back of a Pamida storeroom (check the discount Aceyalone cut, ""Different"").</p><p>
<i>""Just as in evaluating a dog for conformation where you must consider the whole
    dog, not just the parts, so when evaluating Freestyle movement, overanalysis of
    parts-- feet, tail, head, body-- results in loss of the whole picture. You can
    analyze a Mozart piano concerto note by note and still not fathom the genius of
    the whole piece. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.""  --From the
    article, ""Music, Rhythm and Freestyle,"" by Alison Jaskiewicz</i></p><p>
    
    Ms. Jaskiewicz has a good point. While I'll avoid any Mozart references, I do
    appreciate the general structure of her analogy. The Fellowship has always been
    about the rhymes.  Thus, the ""freestyle"" association.  The whole story is that
    Aceyalone, Mikah 9, P.E.A.C.E. and Saturn still have flow.  Sure, that flow has
    changed with age, but it's still confident and sort-of interesting. The first few
    tracks, notably ""No Hooks, No Chorus"" and the title track, sound mature but remain
    fierce. Overall, though, the frenetic spirit displayed on their first two discs
    has regressed a little, backing up from ""inspiring"" to ""decent.""  And for all its
    flaws, it really isn't a bad disc.  Just a disappointing one.</p></div>"|3189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3189-temptations/|6.6|Brad Haywood

    early form of a band can often be underdeveloped.  Consider all the factors.
    There's the concept, because who doesn't have an angle these days?  There's
    the image: what are they going to stand for, and who's supposed to think they're
    cool?  There's the labor: how will the band get heard, and get its rather angular,
    imaginary message across?  There's the people: what combination of personality
    disorders will help them achieve all they desire?  And lastly, there's the music:
    what mixture of influences and accidents are they going to hide when their record
    gets played (hopefully)?  It's a wonder bands ever happen at all.</p><p>
    
    The notion of personalities (and their various disorders) should never be
    underestimated as the band gathers form and direction.  I imagine that one or two
    dominant forces will be the impetus for starting the group, and may preside as
    reining catalysts for the major decisions at first (see above).  Over time, the
    other members will either go along with the plan, or assert their visions into
    the group dynamic.  Sometimes that means things fall apart, but if not,
    interesting reactions can happen.  Or not.  It almost seems a stroke of luck,
    with no more predetermination than a coin toss, whether the band exists for very
    long.</p><p>
    
    I've written about a few Japanese bands for Pitchfork, and as you may or may
    not know, several of the players are known to move in and out of other bands
    and projects.  When I look back on it, many of these projects seem more like
    one-time affairs, or just chance encounters that happened to be recorded.  A
    few of the projects are long-term, but even many of those feature people who
    are known better for playing other music, or with other people.  I've always
    wondered how the same pool of talent keeps mixing and remixing with itself to
    produce so much interesting sound.  Of course, the musicians are quite good and
    experienced and such, but I was taught in Rock Journalism 201 (probably Christgau's
    section, the old hag) that talent doesn't guarantee anything except raised
    expectations for the listener.</p><p>
    
    Kikuchi Naruyoshi used to play with a very nice band called Tipographica.  They
    were never a big club act, but maintained a fairly widespread following for fans
    of avant-garde rock and free jazz, making something of a Zappa noise, though in
    that infamously hectic Japanese style.  Unfortunately, they broke up (personality
    issues?  Money?  Ran out of impossibly complicated heads?), and went their own
    ways.  Naruyoshi started playing free improv and spacy fusion with his Tokyo
    Zawinul Bach duo, maybe because after so many years in a large ensemble (Tipo was
    six strong), two guys seemed an easier task to manage.  But that can't be right,
    because he then formed a huge band with a huge name called Date Course Pentagon
    Royal Garden.</p><p>
    
    This band has 10-12 people at any given moment (of which Otomo Yoshihide is
    probably the most well known in the West, though other eminent figures are
    involved as well).  They also bring a touch of fusion to the mix, but as often
    will play 20-minute noise-trance, perhaps similar to Rovo (with whom they
    released a split CD) or even Tortoise if they upped the noise quotient a bit.
    This is all well and good, but given the fact so many people are involved, and
    perhaps due to Naruyoshi's relatively quick change in direction, their most recent
    release seems a tad underdeveloped.</p><p>
<i>Report from Iron Mountain</i> (named after a confidential U.S. government war report
    from the early 60s, as well as a prominent Japanese ""live-house"" where the band
    has appeared) features about half lengthy experimental tunes, and half straight
    ahead funk-fusion.  Okay, what's so special about that?  ""Catch 22"" starts things
    off in a very cool way by playing trance from an unbalanced point of view.
    Multiple drummers play in seemingly multiple meters and tempos, while a Fender
    Rhodes figure repeats, and synth noise tears apart any unnecessary tonality.   A
    lady says ""I'm something special"" a few times, though it's not as if anyone has
    to convince me on the merits of turning workaday post-rock into an anarchic
    symphonette.  About midway through, things take a change for the violent, as the
    tempo increases threefold, and the bass degenerates into a two-note pattern, all
    the while supporting a very fiery guitar solo.  It seems as if Naruyoshi's
    tendency to jazz things up has been overtaken by the group noise.</p><p>
    
    ""Play Mate at Hanoi"" is much more low-key, almost like something Return to Forever
    would have done during one of Chick Corea's less dramatic moments.  A very 70s
    analog synthline plays a fluid lead, while the bass and restrained, upbeat
    percussion accompanies.  An organ jumps out of the right speaker, similar to some
    of the playing on the early Miles Davis fusion records, wherein the organ acted
    more as a confrontational coloring element than actual comping instrument.  This
    leads to a nice soprano sax solo, and the tune is well within the domain of
    standard fusion.  A pretty abrupt change from the first tune, but that's not
    really strange in itself.</p><p>
    
    That is, until ""S.""  This begins with a very lounge-y funk figure on guitar
    (surely, not Yoshihide, though he is one of the credited guitar players), and
    some roller-rink organ.  The band enters with congas and something of a samba-rock
    beat.  I step back, and to my horror, realize the band is playing cocktail music,
    like you hear on cruises and commercials for said cruises.  Another soprano solo
    ensues, and is so smooth I wonder if this is even the same band that played the
    first song.  And it lasts for almost eleven minutes like that!  Later, the band
    pulls a similar trick on their cover of ""Hey Joe,"" playing very standard (and
    often corny) funk-rock for about ten minutes before I come to the realization
    they're not going anywhere ironic with this.  We're talking music with the edge
    of a mouthwash ad.</p><p>
    
    There is a bit of redemption in ""Circle/Line~Hard Core Peace,"" where they play
    more fusion licks, but bring in a touch of polyrhythmic groove, and a tad more
    excitement to the barrage of soprano solos.  However, I'm still left with the
    sting of unfulfilled promise from the first tune, and wondering if these guys
    should ever have made this record.  Maybe it sounds better live, or perhaps that
    everything was recorded at different dates (and in three different studios)
    signifies that the concept for how the band should sound changed from time to
    time.  I'm a huge fan of juxtaposing genres and concepts, and certainly like to
    see all my favorite players get together, but <i>Report from Iron Mountain</i>
    seems to me like what happens when group dynamic and development is overwhelmed
    by lack of focus.  As a result, underwhelming.</p></div>"|2177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2177-report-from-iron-mountain/|6.0|Dominique Leone

The paradise of every teenage boy's imagination, details filled in by
    dozens of late 70s/early 80s hard-R comedies from days when gratuitous nudity was still a treasured
    cinematic tradition.  Oh the sexy, sexy things happening in every girls' locker room, just beyond the
    furrowed brow of a pubescent male population trying to develop X-ray vision.  Only the slumber party
    pillow fight can compete with the girls' locker room showers in evoking imagery that's given rise to a
    thousand sticky nights.</p><p>
    
    If I'm starting to creep you out a bit (and to tell the truth, I'm starting to creep myself out),
    it's a reasonable approximation of what I think Pele was going for in claiming that <i>Enemies</i>
    was recorded in, yep, a girls' locker room.  Combined with the unfortunately detailed pencil
    drawing of the drummer sans garments on his lower half (yes, there is wang), the whole package has
    a certain sex offender tint to it.</p><p>
    
    Surely, this ploy is intended to counteract the relatively antiseptic nature of the band's chosen
    genre, instrumental math-rock, whose bands are constantly striving-- tendons taut, foreheads dotted
    with sweat-- to avoid being considered mere background music.  Perhaps they thought a dose of sinisterness
    would give listeners something they could get a firm grip on, but for all the pent-up fantasies that fueled
    this record, <i>Enemies</i> doesn't rise to the occasion.</p><p>
    
    Pele are at their best when their compositions feel like progressions rather than a lot of
    cool-sounding parts somewhat arbitrarily soldered together.  ""Safe Dolphin"" has a few dashes of jarring
    synth thrown in to keep things slightly off-balance, and ""Hospital Sports"" holds its own with mean
    acoustic/electric guitar interplay.  These tracks evolve with admirable patience and a spontaneous
    feel; if only math-rock fans knew how close some of this material is to that of more accomplished
    jam bands, they wouldn't be wearing their horn-rims so high.</p><p>
    
    Pele are attempting to fight the rut they've start to mine with the addition of a fourth member,
    suspiciously credited as playing ""computer + tambourines"" (just like Wilco!).  Unfortunately, the software isn't for
    any of them loops or glitches the kids like these days, but rather for determined attempts at texture.
    Read: incongruous buzzing and cut-up radio transmissions inserted all over ""Crisis Win"", and
    mysterious noises that had my orange-alert-skittish heart looking for exploding ordinances on my walk
    to the subway.</p><p>
    
    The original trio tries to keep pace with this new texture, most of which is similar to the majority of
    process-driven laptop-jiggering.  ""Safe Dolphin"" is almost done in a couple times by quiet
    sections where the percussion sounds like somebody kicking a trash bag around, while ""Sepit"" uses
    similar junkyard effects to annoying result.  Transitions like ""Hooves""-- an unfortunate misstep into a
    pile of new age-- and technical workouts like ""Cooking Light"" (where <i>too many people
    solo at once</i>) don't help matters.</p><p>
    
    Yet <i>Enemies</i> is a complaisant album; enjoyable, but not to the point of sticking long in one's
    memory.  The biggest criticism I could level against Pele could apply to the whole math-rock genre:
    With Out Hud's <i>S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D.</i> still fresh in the underground hive mind, <i>Enemies</i>
    feels like an unnecessary step back to the days when indie instrumentals weren't so excitingly
    infected with the disco virus.  Despite the palpable horniness its recording environment inspires,
    <i>Enemies</i> is, like so much of its brethren, an entirely unsexy affair, and thus a rather sterile
    listen.</p></div>"|6222.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6222-enemies/|6.3|Rob Mitchum

Olsson distribute their work directly
    to bargain bins, kind of like Gary Busey does with the video store. For whatever
    reason, it seems that every used CD store nationwide (including stores in Virginia,
    Michigan and New York) has multiple copies of Aparo's <i>The American</i> and
    Olsson's <i>Words for Living</i> (joining, of course, multiple copies of the Verve
    Pipe's <i>Villains</i>, and a smattering of King's X). I haven't heard much from
    either artist, but the impression ""the bin"" gives me is that neither is very good.</p><p>
    
    After a recent evening of CD shopping, I could have easily concluded that the Fruit
    Bats blow. Out of six Manhattan second-hand merchants, four had copies of
    <i>Echolocation</i>, and although the disc had yet to find the bargain bin in any
    of them, it seemed their ultimate destiny. The reason I kept an open mind is that
    I had seen the group in concert, opening for the Shins and Modest Mouse in
    late September. The show wasn't that great, but it was certainly tolerable, and
    you could tell that vocalist/songwriter Eric Johnson enjoyed himself on stage and
    took his job seriously. It's hard to not at least appreciate a guy who loves what
    he's doing.</p><p>
    
    As the live show was tolerable, so is <i>Echolocation</i>, but not much more.  The
    Fruit Bats seem obsessed with one sound, one that I would describe as folk-country
    indie-pop, for lack of a more appropriate sub-sub-sub-genre label.  In short, lots
    of acoustic guitar and lazy, slow-rolling sentimental compositions, peppered with
    banjo, ukulele, piano and pleasant vocal harmonies. Clearly summer-time music.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, though, what you hear on the album's first track, ""The Old Black
    Hole,"" is pretty much what you hear on tracks 2-12. Every song moves at the same
    country tempo, with the similar sounding folksy accoutrements, and almost-convincing
    sentimentality. When I forgot I was listening, it was pleasant. When I tuned in
    more closely, I was left impatient, crying out to the Fruit Bats, ""Go somewhere
    already!"" In this way, it may have been better if the Fruit Bats were fronted by
    the <i>other</i> Eric Johnson, of ""Cliffs of Dover"" fame, and friend to fellow G3
    Guitar Summit participants Steve Vai and Joe ""Satch"" Satriani. That would have
    blown my ass off. Then again, I probably wouldn't have been able to hear much
    ukulele over Johnson's overdriven polyrhythms and unusual dorian modes.</p><p>
    
    Other than infrequent exclamations resulting from my boredom (see above),
    <i>Echolocation</i> sparked very little reaction from me, either positive or
    negative. Chances are, I won't listen to it much. Chances are better that I'll
    be visiting one of those two stores that didn't have a copy.</p></div>"|3229.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3229-echolocation/|5.9|Brad Haywood

    it often focuses on their work as composers.  Musicians who routinely play a whole
    set without a written note can turn around and make albums where their writing
    dictates the flow of performance-- working in a mix of improv and composition that
    aims to be more refined and maybe more high-brow than free jazz.  Susie Ibarra,
    the star drummer who has collaborated on high-intensity jazz gigs with David S.
    Ware and William Parker (as well touring with Yo La Tengo and adding percussive
    effects to their <i>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out</i>), has recorded
    two albums on Tzadik that showcase her spacious writing.  Her second and most
    recent album, <i>Songbird Suite</i>, uses an all-star trio (plus guest Ikue Mori)
    to perform a set of austere and beautiful pieces.</p><p>
    
    Ibarra kicks off the album by taking the trio out for a spin.  She's joined by
    Craig Taborn on piano, keyboards, and electronics, and Jennifer Choi on violin.
    On the straightforward ""Azul,"" Taborn and Choi's solos demonstrate their unique
    approaches.  Taborn, who made his name with James Carter and has stolen the show
    in several avant-jazz combos, demonstrates why he's one of the most inventive and
    fun pianists out there: his solo is rigorous but joyful, busy but methodical.  It
    churns with enthusiastic clusters of sound.  Choi, a classically trained violinist,
    is aggressively virtuosic: she swoops around the melody like a canary tied to a
    firecracker, working an array of sounds from her instrument.  Ibarra doesn't
    showcase her own playing until her drum feature ""Trance #1"": her performance is
    reflective and full of silence, with Asian-sounding percussion complementing her
    drumkit.</p><p>
    
    These players are as attentive to sound and texture as to the notes, and Ibarra's
    compositions give them a variety of frameworks.  The title track, the album's
    centerpiece, lets the trio explores open space: Taborn begins with quiet,
    sonar-like electronics, and Choi and Ibarra ease in with stark splashes of color.
    Taborn has rarely played piano and electronics on the same album, let alone on the
    same song (as he does for ""Flower After Flower""); this album is a great example of
    how expansive his palette has become.  Choi's statements and Ibarra's interjections
    complement Taborn to make a complete sound world-- so complete that when they
    include an actual birdsong recording on the track, the effect is clumsily literal.</p><p>
    
    It's an equal trio on the slow numbers, but on the busier tunes, Taborn and Ibarra
    become a steadier rhythm section behind Choi's violin.  ""Nocturne"" starts with
    another soaring, fiery violin solo propelled by Taborn and Ibarra.  The squeaking
    extremes of her high register give way to an eerie, distant sound in the quiet
    section, and then a jittery conclusion where each player creates arch, precise
    lines.</p><p>
    
    Ikue Mori, a Tzadik regular and a leading improviser on laptop computer, plays on
    three tracks-- an improvised duet with Ibarra, and two group pieces.  Mori's
    burbling, percussive samples add to the slow burn of ""Flower After Flower"" and
    ""Trance #3.""  Her sound is busier and slightly less compelling than the other
    three musicians', but she adds an interesting commentary, and her duet with Ibarra,
    ""Trance #2,"" is a short, fascinating soundscape of otherworldly percussion sounds.</p><p>
    
    With this concise album-- just forty-five minutes for nine tunes-- the trio
    thoroughly explores Ibarra's writing.  <i>Songbird Suite</i> exemplifies what
    Tzadik's composer-focused imprints aim for: an album of new music that shows the
    best collaboration between an open-minded composer and sympathetic improvisers.</p></div>"|4043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4043-songbird-suite/|8.3|Chris Dahlen

I liked rock
    music and jazz.  I didn't like hip-hop or country.  But after I started working,
    and was able to buy more music, I found my tastes had developed. I no longer
    limited my purchases to certain genres, and as a result I began to discover
    musicians of all stripes I enjoyed. But not everyone's musical taste grows up
    along with them. Many continue to depend on genres rather than sound to decide
    what they'll try. Many continue to make brash all-encompassing statements like,
    ""I don't like dance music,"" or ""I don't like classical music,"" well into their
    middle-ages and beyond.</p><p>
    Consider <i>Electric Ladyland: Clickhop Version 1.0</i>, an attempted public
    service from Mille Plateaux (yes, the same often-revolutionary Mille Plateaux label
    that also brought us the <i>Clicks and Cuts</i> series). Following in the footsteps
    of Prefuse 73's Scott Herren, Machine Drum and other like-minded acts, the artists
    assembled on this two-disc collection dedicate themselves to furthering the recent
    trend that sees the shrinking of the gap between hip-hop, dance and electronic
    music.  The results are as varied as are the approaches.</p><p>
    On the sparse ""M 06 Short,"" alva.noto sculpts quiet beats out of static. Safety
    Scissors contributes an eminently danceable soundscape of chopped-up samples with
    ""Mr. Blister is Connected to My Fingers."" And there's Spectre's minimalist
    instrumental, ""Infra-Red (Danse of the Dead Part 2),"" which gets more mileage out
    of three or four samples-- chopped up and pitch-shifted, naturally-- and a simple
    beat than many artists get out of a full record library.</p><p>
    That benchmark of hip-hop/electronic amalgamations, the now-trademarked Prefuse
    73-style chopped-up vocal manipulations, shows up a few times here-- most
    effectively on Andreas Tilliander's spastic ""Hastjobb"" and AGF/DLAY's opener
    ""The Return of Us.""  It's an interesting-sounding technique, and its popularity
    is justified, but listening to the lyrics on <i>Electric Ladyland</i>'s other
    vocal tracks, one begins to wonder if there isn't another reason why garbled
    vocals seem to appear almost as often as the real thing these days.</p><p>
    With the
    exception of Dälek's rhymes about revolution and fellowship on Kid606's remix
    of ""R. U. IN IT"" (at least, those parts not totally obscured by spastic strokes
    of noise), the vocals on <i>Electric Ladyland</i> rarely merit much notice. At
    best, we get self-aggrandizing wordplay from Antipop Consortium's High Priest.
    At worst, Graphit E ponders the location of his niggas. All around there's an
    unfortunate feeling that someone somewhere decided that lyrical content doesn't
    matter so long as the music behind the words is unique, an unfortunate decision
    that keeps <i>Electric Ladyland</i> from achieving all it might have.</p><p>
    Also disappointing (by no fault of the artists-- I lay the blame on the comp's
    producer) are contributions by Captain Comatose and German house stars MRI which
    make extensive use of the same female vocal track.  While this could have been an
    interesting experiment, there's little with which to differentiate the two tracks,
    especially considering that both accompany the singer's pontifications with a
    driving bassline, bleeps and little flourishes circling a beat.</p><p>
    Still, there are a lot of solid tracks here.  Frank Bretschneider's ""Holt"" is a
    simple yet effective downtempo number built around a handful of resonating,
    electronically produced tones and crackling percussion. Auch's ""All That Pretty
    Horses"" starts off heading in the same direction, but takes a wrong turn somewhere
    along the line into a minefield of commonplace glitchery.</p><p>
    Towering above all the rest, though, is Akufen's contribution, a track called
    ""Little Hop of Horror,"" that begins with the cacophonous static and random noise
    of a manipulated radio tuning knob, before finally tuning in on a laid-back,
    guitar-based funk groove. As the song plays out, Akufen makes unpredictable loops
    out of the bits of static and random radio sounds. While many of the tracks here
    entertain, this is one of the few that truly succeeds in merging elements of
    experimental, dance and hip-hop.</p><p>
    Ultimately, the biggest problem with <i>Electric Ladyland</i> is that, in its
    admittedly noble attempt to disregard genre lines, it tends to come up short where
    cohesiveness is concerned. Though its goal is, without a doubt, to open the minds
    of listeners to other musical possibilities, I can't help but feel that some of
    the straightforward 4/4 time dance tracks, like Sophie Anderson's ""Don't Follow""
    will grate on those listeners who get a kick out of more experimental fare like
    ""Hastjobb"" and vice versa. More tracks like Akufen's would have made for a more
    compelling compilation-- one with a stronger unifying theme. Instead, <i>Electric
    Ladyland</i> is just a collection of solid songs. This is hardly a bad thing, but
    if compilations are to be held to the same standards as straight-up albums, then
    it's impossible to deny that this one seems a bit lost at times.</p><p>
    In many ways, hip-hop, dance and electronic music have grown up next door to one
    another.  Each existed for ages as a vague idea rather than as an actual genre or
    style; all three came into their own in the 80s; and all gained mainstream
    appreciation in the 90s. Today, we often see hip-hop, dance and electronic music
    pandering to the masses, cheap bastardizations of brilliant work masquerading as
    the real thing.  So it's reassuring to know that there are artists-- just as there
    have been since the early 20th century-- toiling away in relative obscurity,
    ensuring that both genres continue to develop. Maybe one day, thanks to their
    work, no one will miss out on great music due to some prejudicial, predetermined
    notion of genre. In the meantime, the enlightened among us can enjoy <i>Electric
    Ladyland: Clickhop Version 1.0</i>.</p></div>"|1932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1932-electric-ladyland-clickhop-version-10/|7.6|David M. Pecoraro

I'm a straight shooter like Larry Bird.""</p><p>
    This is an actual line from one of the songs on Vermont's <i>Calling Albany</i>.
    Actually, it's not just one line, it's the chorus. I just wanted to get it out
    there in the open for all to see, and get it away from its buffering support
    system-- all the other lame, just-barely passable lyrics on the album-- so it can
    be publicly humiliated.  Who actually sits down and puts words like these on paper,
    scratches their chin, and says, ""Yeah!""?</p><p>
    Davey Von Bohlen and Dan Didier from the Promise Ring and Chris Rosenau from Pele,
    that's who. This is the trio's second album, and after forcing myself through it
    a few times, here's hoping Vermont's members start spending a lot more time at
    their day jobs right quick. Not that I was ever much of a fan of the Promise Ring
    or Pele, but considering that this sounds nothing like either of them, I don't
    think it's a issue.</p><p>
    Judging from the cliché-ridden lyrics showcased here, I can understand why so much
    Promise Ring material I remember hearing was so terse.  Or maybe the bad lyrics
    were always there, buried under the sugar-sweet pop banality.  Regardless, this is
    not the case with Vermont. The sparse, often acoustic musical backdrop pushes the
    lyrics to the fore, and, to put it plainly, they don't hold up well under the
    increased scrutiny. The melodramatic posturing and self-pity that was kept (more)
    in check in the Promise Ring is given free reign with Vermont, and nearly every
    song title is a heavy-handed attempt at a pun or some other half-assed witticism,
    which makes the ultra-serious vocal delivery and stark instrumentation even more
    annoying.</p><p>
    Besides the above quoted nadir, there are a few other noteworthy low points on
    <i>Calling Albany</i>. To start from the bottom, there's a (near) cover of the
    Commodores' ""Three Times a Lady"" nestled within a song called ""Commodores 64.""
    Done up all singer/songwriterly, the slow jam classic becomes a maudlin joke.
    Now's a good time to remind Vermont that we're not in the High Age of Slacker
    Irony anymore; the days of the Cardigans covering Sabbath are long gone (and surely
    even these guys can appreciate that).  These days, people just don't get away with
    this kind of thing unless a little something extra is brought to the table.</p><p>
    On ""Chlorine Chlorine,"" we're given the standard emo-rock workout while being
    told, ""I like books better than movies"" (gee, smart <i>and</i> sensitive-- do
    I smell a ""Gilmore Girls"" guest shot?), and the untitled fourth songs (denoted by
    a red dot on the sleeve) is an adolescence tale of striving for independence from
    Mom and Dad while lamenting anonymity at the local coffeeshop. Then there's the
    opener, ""Bells of Saint Alcohol,"" Vermont's stab at creating some kind of rote
    emo-country sub-genre. With a slow, rambling tempo and accordion support, the
    music is nice enough, but add the lyrics to the mix and it sound like castrated
    Bright Eyes.  At best.</p><p>
    I could only recommend <i>Calling Albany</i> to someone if they were really, really
    hard up for something new from Pedro the Lion, but even then I couldn't do it with
    an absolute clear conscience.  As for everyone else, I <i>insist</i> you stay as
    far away from this record as possible.</p></div>"|8449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8449-calling-albany/|2.7|Jason Nickey

Today, modern aircraft technology got
    me from Indianapolis to Boston in six hours, with a stop in Newark in between.
    Modern airport security technology let the people in charge know that I was
    carrying metal objects.  To my amazement, they ignored it and waved me through
    without checking me.  Luckily for them, I didn't have a revolver strapped to my
    hip-- rather, I was merely making use of the slightly more archaic pants-retaining
    technology known as a belt buckle.</p><p>
    
    I guess you could say that all of this falls under the umbrella of using technology
    for good, even if human misjudgment sometimes interferes with its purpose.  Of
    course, human mismanagement spoils a lot of potentially promising technology on a
    regular basis-- just look at the music industry.  Somewhere along the line, bigshot
    producers seem to have picked up the idea that if you take a terrible song and
    dress it up in enough shiny electronic packaging, it will become a good song.  At
    some point, the public apparently confirmed that this idea generates large amounts
    of income, because it's become fairly standard practice.</p><p>
    
    That's just my theory, of course.  Naturally, I have a lot of corollary theories
    to that one, principle among them being that if overproduction can mask a piece
    of crap, then it can also mask a gem.  Upon listening to <i>Alive to Every Smile</i>,
    Trembling Blue Stars' fourth album, I found that second theory being proven, and
    I grinned like the smug bastard that I am.</p><p>
    
    Head Star Robert Wratten (formerly of Field Mice) writes some pretty decent songs,
    when you break them down to their base elements.  The melodies are fine, if
    unspectacular, and the lyrics are better than average broken heart stories--
    suffice to say, Wratten probably has his navel pretty much memorized by now.
    Unfortunately, producer Ian Catt seems intent on giving <i>Alive to Every Smile</i>
    a bigger sound than it really needs to get its point across.  A lot of bands
    venture close to soft-rock territory and come out unscathed.  Trembling Blue Stars
    aren't so lucky.</p><p>
    
    The two greatest offenders come back-to-back in the middle of the album.  ""Here
    All Day"" opens with some syrupy organs, over which Wratten intones in his
    unbelievably fey voice, ""Someone stop the hands of time/ Every tick's a cruel
    blow.""  Multi-tracked female backing vocals swim in Lexicon reverb, invading the
    second verse before big, booming toms ripped straight from a 1984 top 40 station
    provide the final scuttling blow.  ""Until the Dream Gets Broken"" follows with
    programmed bongos and the same backing vocals, both featured more prominently this
    time.  The gloss is so blinding that it's difficult to see the song underneath.</p><p>
    
    Those bloody backing vocals pop up all over the place, too, and they never once
    truly add anything necessary to the song in question.  They're just a distracting
    background texture on the otherwise good ""Ghost of an Unkissed Kiss.""  The rest
    of the arrangement is fine, though, drawing from 80s jangle pop and adding in a
    nicely executed backward guitar solo for good measure.  The refrain of, ""Dry eyes,
    dry eyes/ It was never going to end with dry eyes,"" is probably the catchiest
    thing on the album.  With a slightly dryer mix, though, it could be more immediate.</p><p>
    
    One improvement Wratten and the band have made since their last effort, 2000's
    <i>Broken by Whispers</i>, is the fact that their songs now flow a little more
    smoothly from section to section.  A lot of the songs on that album were plagued
    by jarring transitions from quiet verses to loud, seemingly unrelated choruses.
    Here, only one song suffers from that affliction.  ""Maybe After All"" opens with
    quietly strummed verses drenched in reverb (there's actually a rather neat little
    bit of processed hi-hat embedded low in the mix, too), and suddenly transitions
    after a couple of minutes into a dry verse complete with drums, bass and some
    nice countermelodic guitar parts.  And of course, before long, those damn backing
    vocals are back, taking up the space that would have sounded better empty.</p><p>
    
    One of the main reasons <i>Alive to Every Smile</i> turns out so disappointing
    is that it begins on such an interesting note.  ""Under Lock and Key"" opens the
    record with distorted drums and varied tape speeds before a guitar loop enters
    and Wratten actually says something assertive for once.  ""You've got to stop
    fucking her up/ You've got to grow up,"" he sings to a guy who presumably isn't
    treating his girlfriend very well.  Wratten's guitar tone is thick and commanding--
    it reminds you that he can actually really play the thing well.  He also handles
    the backing vocals himself, which is a plus.</p><p>
    
    ""With Every Story"" actually carries on fairly well from there, with Wratten
    pulling out a good chord progression and a nice, Bernard Sumner-inspired guitar
    sound, but the sheen that plagues the rest of album begins to creep in, and by
    the third song there's really no going back.  Closer ""Little Gunshots"" makes
    something of an attempt to darken things a bit with a brooding synth figure, but
    the textures turn a little too new age-y to be really engaging.  By the time the
    album ends, it's easy to find yourself somewhat sick of Wratten's merciless
    self-pity, too.  He ends things with the lines, ""You're waving from a leaving
    train/ And every part of me screams your name/ Think again, please think again,""
    and it's a bit of a relief knowing that he's finally done complaining.</p><p>
    
    Fans of past Trembling Blue Stars efforts will probably find a lot to enjoy about
    <i>Alive to Every Smile</i>, even with the overproduction.  Most other people
    would be pretty well-advised to stay away, unless you're desperately seeking an
    indie-approved gateway into the world of lite FM.  Ultimately, the band and their
    producer fall into the trap of placing too much stock in technology, sadly failing
    to trust Wratten's songwriting to work on its own.  In the end, the surface has
    become so smooth that there's almost nothing left to grip at all.  In the future,
    Wratten &amp; co. would do well to put yet another theory to work for them: less is
    more.</p></div>"|8148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8148-alive-to-every-smile/|5.9|Joe Tangari

The FDA has
    begun testing it as anal ternative general anesthesia for certain surgical
    procedures.  Law enforcement officials have suggested using it to subdue
    anti-globalization protesters at this summer's WTO rally.  I'm saying Owen's
    debut album is going to put you to sleep here, people!</p><p>
    
    Which is not necessarily a bad thing.  As I grow older, sleep is quickly becoming
    one of my favorite activities, and an album that assists me in the process can
    hold a very special place in my collection.  Sedative qualities don't have to
    equal boring; it can also mean the music is just pleasant or comforting.  At the
    end of a long, hard day, I like nothing more than putting a CD in my stereo and
    gently drifting off to sleep, something that's hard to do with the Ramones or
    Jay-Z on.</p><p>
    
    Owen, by the way, is not a guy named Owen, but the solo project of one Mike
    Kinsella, indie-rock journeyman formerly/currently of American Football, Joan of
    Arc, and Owls.  Why Kinsella would name his one-man band Owen rather than, say,
    Mike, is a mystery, though I like to think that it's in tribute to mid-80s Red
    Sox shortstop Spike Owen.  Not likely, but a nice scenario.</p><p>
    
    Kinsella pulls off his musical sandman act by primarily utilizing that most sleepy
    of instruments, the acoustic guitar.  Eschewing chord strumming for delicate,
    dreamy finger-picking, Owen's songs generally sit on a central riff repeated for
    the three- or four-minute duration, lulling the listener into a hypnotic state.
    Kinsella's just-above-a-whisper vocals also soothe the ear, a million miles away
    from the throaty yelp of his brother Tim and generally avoiding typical
    verse-chorus structure or melody.</p><p>
    
    If this all sounds like an unplugged version of American Football, you're mostly
    right.  But the setting is considerably more intimate on Owen, without Kinsella's
    earlier vehicle's spiraling guitar epics and octopus drumming.  Also gone is the
    post-breakup open wound nature of American Football's lyrics, the raw honesty of
    which could provoke weeping fits or retching, depending on one's tolerance for
    emoting.
    
    Instead, Owen's themes are considerably less traumatic, if not exactly sunshine
    and lollipops (one song is called ""Declaration of Incompetence"").  And when drums--
    organic or programmed-- are added into the mix, they're sedate and simple, keeping
    the tunes from floating off into space without disrupting the relaxed tone.  The
    other instrumental flourishes Kinsella adds to the mix-- vibraphone, organ,
    strings-- similarly add depth and color to his compositions without becoming a
    distraction.</p><p>
    
    The combination works best on the album closer, ""Think About It,"" which progresses
    patiently through three distinct movements over its seven-minute run time.  Many
    of the tracks are seamlessly blended into one another, maintaining the warm,
    drowsy glow with brief instrumental passages.  ""Accidentally"" serves as the
    strongest of these, as Kinsella slowly overdubs more and more guitars playing
    complimenting themes until the song builds into a soft, cushy pillow of...
    zzzzzzzz...</p><p>
    
    Whoa.  Sorry about that.</p><p>
    
    Given the above description, it'd be easy to categorize Owen as mope-core, or
    slow-core, or curl-up-in-the-fetal-position-and-have-a-good-cry-core.  Correct,
    too; Kinsella invites the comparison himself by not too subtly mimicking the Red
    House Painters on ""Places to Go.""  But while Owen adds little to the genre's
    customary sound, one has to admit he does it well by not letting the tortoise-like
    pace get too monotonous.</p><p>
    
    Obviously then, if this kind of subdued, contemplative music makes you want to
    kick someone in the groin, Owen should not be placed on your to-buy list.  But
    if you're more receptive to sad white guys making music in their bedroom, or if
    your prescription for Valium is running out, it might be for you.  Just don't
    operate any heavy machinery during use.</p></div>"|6072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6072-owen/|7.2|Rob Mitchum

    himself up so well.  Beginning in 2000 with <i>Pastoral Composure</i>, and moving
    on through <i>New Orbit</i> (see the phrase in the liner notes: ""Cosmic
    Consciousness"") and his work with the David S. Ware Quartet on their <i>Corridors
    and Parallels</i>, the man seems to be suggesting he's onto some kind of
    metaspatial physics that's all his own.  <i>Corridors and Parallels</i> may
    actually have been a slight low point for Shipp; trading piano for Korg synthesizer
    might have looked good on paper, but in practice the ethereal tones didn't
    integrate well with the earthy flavor of Ware &amp; Co.  But now Shipp's back with
    <i>Nu Bop</i>, the latest record in Thirsty Ear's Blue Series.  This time around,
    he's brought in musician and producer Chris Flam to add electronic beats to the
    mix, and the results are solid.</p><p>
    
    Of course, you can't approach greatness in jazz without punning on your name.  So
    <i>Nu Bop</i> begins with ""Space Shipp,"" and the scrunchy beats make themselves
    evident immediately.  They don't play into fashions like jungle, just squelch
    mechanically as Shipp pounds along and bassist William Parker grooves concordantly.
    Guillermo E. Brown's percussion rumbles along with the programmed rhythms, kicking
    up some hip-hop influence, and Shipp gets inspired and tickles all up and down the
    scales.  The title track sees Parker in funk mode, bobbing lightly along with the
    drum breaks until Brown adds a whole other layer of bass drum rolls and cymbal
    crashes to the bricolage.  And speaking of which, the breaks (not to mention to
    cover art) do bear a strong resemblance to Amon Tobin, but then Daniel Carter's
    alto sax wails off in some strangely muted distance and Shipp rushes in after
    four minutes like a surprise.</p><p>
    
    Flam's beats, for the most part, were laid down before the sessions, and taken
    into the studio so the musicians could improvise over them.  Shipp's playing is
    based on individual notes rather than the dense harmonic flurries he used to be
    known for.  The danger, of course, is pulling a <i>Doo-Bop</i> a la Miles Davis--
    downplaying your skills to cut a pop record and grab at hipster cred.  But Shipp
    drops accents in unexpected, slightly off-meter places, as on ""D's Choice,"" an
    all-out jam between Shipp's Monk-like plunks, Brown's sharp snaps, and some chirpy
    synth beats.</p><p>
    
    Shipp may call the album <i>Nu Bop</i>, but the arrangements here
    are more influenced by the birth of the cool.  The small amount of players allows
    the musical inputs to mix seamlessly, and amazingly, it never sounds like ""Shipp
    remixed.""  The only time the processing draws attention to itself as something
    added is on ""Select Mode 1,"" a little minute-and-a-half throwaway jam whose
    keyboard-demo riddim track should have just been scrapped.</p><p>
    
    ""ZX-1,"" a solo piece by Shipp, breaks the fast flow of the other tracks for some
    introspection.  The minor-key chords reverberate from deep in the chamber, bringing
    a feeling of melancholy until he slips into the upper registers and becomes
    perplexingly both lighter in tone and yet more tense.  Near the end, ""Nu Abstract""
    finds Shipp caged, emitting discordant echoes as a nebula of pulsing drones swells
    beneath him.  He's familiar with this type of soupy ambience from his work on
    Spring Heel Jack's <i>Masses</i> project, and the piece radiates the same ominous
    vibes.  But more often, this album is about percussive synthesis, as on ""Rocket
    Shipp,"" with Shipp tumbling precariously across the ivories and Parker practically
    slapping his bass.  Brown is so energetic and the drum tracks are so interwoven
    that at times it's hard to tell where flesh ends and bytes begin.</p><p>
    
    Shipp and company have a feat worthy of the fractal juxtapositions and futurist
    font on the album sleeve: they've laid down a fusion record that doesn't fall into
    limp acid-jazz wank or pop posturing.  But to do so, they may have sacrificed a
    bit of humor.  For all the enthusiasm in their playing, they've used a very
    monochromatic palette here.  The serious tone is most apparent in Shipp, whose
    dark, monolithic thunks bespeak a certain singularity of purpose.  I find myself
    wishing for another moment or two like ""X-Ray,"" which features a serene flute
    melody from Daniel Carter.</p><p>
<i>Nu Bop</i> doesn't quite reach the lyrical beauty
    of <i>New Orbit</i>, but it's clear that the guys haven't set out to do anything
    but record a hell of a funky album.  As Shipp says at the end of a track, ""You
    know it took a minute for my brain to go dead, once that happened I was in it!""
    At forty minutes, this is another short but sweet entry in the Blue Series, and
    according to Shipp, there are more on the way.</p></div>"|7116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7116-nu-bop/|7.7|Christopher Dare

As far as I can tell, it's usually an excuse to
    say, ""I don't understand this,"" or, ""This isn't cool,"" and very rarely an actual
    signifier of the importance something has within a greater context.  Furthermore,
    often very interesting ideas can be swept under the rug at the behest of greater
    ""relevance"": where was common sense when Mozart couldn't get a gig, or when Decca
    passed up signing the Beatles in 1962 because ""guitar pop was on the way out""?
    Of course, you can't really blame the folks who missed out, because they really
    weren't doing anything worse than living within the framework of their society,
    and how can anyone really do better?</p><p>
    
    That said, Henry Rollins' latest release, <i>Nice</i>, is utterly irrelevant in the
    context of almost every other album reviewed at Pitchfork.  It's too macho to be
    indie, too rock to be punk, too ""in your face, to tha X-treme"" to be current, too
    Guitar Center to be Amoeba.  It is certainly too Rollins to be subtle or
    multi-dimensional.  Sure, the guy has come a long way since Black Flag, but in
    the wrong direction.  You'd think someone with his IQ (I can't vouch for that,
    but a couple of his spoken word routines had things to ponder) would either 1)
    find a way to channel his energy into music with as much, 2) find a ways make
    something that didn't recall David Lee Roth solo albums, or 3) very quickly find
    a way to make his yell-song vocal stylings more interesting by, I don't know, not
    yelling every single song, all the time.</p><p>
    
    Now, just because Rollins doesn't sound like he has a place among the new rock
    canon doesn't mean that his album is bad.  But it is one of the least interesting
    things I've heard in a while-- and that includes Terry Bradshaw and Paul McCartney
    at the Superbowl.  I suppose there is something to be said for him sticking to his
    guns and all, but that's all I'm going to say about that at the moment.</p><p>
    
    ""Hangin' Around,"" ""One Shot"" and ""What's the Matter, Man"" are all heavy rockers,
    featuring a more-hyped-up-than-usual Rollins over the top (literally, of course).
    However, what really links these tunes is that they could all be featured under a
    WWF highlight reel.  The band plays with a lot of energy, though are necessarily
    in the background to accommodate Rollins' yelp.  Guitars crunch, drums play fills
    that would make Terry Bozio proud, and if muscle is your mode, it may work.
    However, Rollins drops lines like, ""What's hard to an alien man?/ Well, you never
    know what's real"" (huh?) and, ""I am calm hot animal/ Gratefully guilty as charged""
    (I see), and turns a perfectly acceptable cock-rock session into Incredibly Bad
    Poetry.</p><p>
    
    A couple of left turns do spice up the mix: ""Up for It"" is something of a James
    Brown tribute, with faux-""Mother Popcorn"" guitar and slinky groove (""The day to
    day can become such a trip/ The mediocre can make you lose your grip""-- now he
    tells me).  Rollins does the Godfather one better by bringing in some Pointer
    Sisters-esque background singers (!) and uttering the phrase ""I'm up for it"" not
    less than 28 times during the song.  ""I Want So Much More"" starts out on a bad
    foot (James Brown would <i>never</i> do that) by letting us know that Rollins
    ""want[s] so much more"" four times at the beginning of the song, and retaining the
    soul singers (who, to their credit, are probably doing as well with the material
    as you could expect).  However, its down-tempo groove, machine gun trumpet hits
    (yes) and ornery sax solo do make it something of a 70s cop-show back-alley-chase
    soundtrack.  Anyway, it's the most distinctive tune on the disc, so enjoy it while
    it lasts.</p><p>
    
    Other tunes range from rigid, fake Zep (""Hello"") to by-the-numbers punk (""Gone
    Inside the Zero""), which should be a surprise, though music probably isn't
    Rollins' main game.  In fact, I wonder what would happen if Rollins were to ever
    attempt making another punk record.  He seems to have plenty to say, and the
    energy level thing won't be an issue.  The funny thing with him is that since he
    doesn't seem to care about his image anymore (which could be cool in itself),
    you'd think he'd be making records that challenged someone's idea of what new
    rock sounded like.  No dice, but don't lose faith, because Rollins wants so much
    more.  He wants so much more.  Henry Rollins wants so much more.</p></div>"|6824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6824-nice/|3.0|Dominique Leone

    featuring championships at the 2000 HBO World Blaze Battle, the 2000 Rocksteady
    MC Battle and the 1999 Scribble MC Battle. His DJ and producer, Abilities, has
    done fairly well himself, scoring two Regional DMC championships. Well decorated,
    however, does not always spell artistic excellence-- case in point, Sinbad and
    Star Search. This is especially true in the world of hip-hop, where so many people
    generally ""just don't give a fuck."" But what matters most in hip-hop is whether
    you've got the skills to pay the bills. And in this sense, it seems that Eyedea
    and Abilities are worthy of their accolades.</p><p>
    
    The focal point of the duo is Eyedea, a contemplative rapper who's most conscious
    of two things-- who he is (or isn't) and how much he rules.  At one moment, we
    find Eyedea picturing his life as a fish (as on the tripped-out ""Fish"" trilogy),
    or doubting his corporeal existence (as on ""Color My World Mine""); the next, he's
    pulling a lyrical Kaiser Soze with his retrospective battling on ""Big Shots."" His
    lyrical talents are no less impressive than his mood swings, showing variation in
    meter, tempo and vocal tone (although it's always a little nasally and heavy on
    enunciation).</p><p>
    
    The beats and scratches, from the mind and wrists of Abilities, are comparatively
    simple.  The simplicity rears its head in the drums; you won't hear much more than
    firm, straightforward machine-beats on <i>First Born</i>. No copped drum breaks,
    shuffles, or funky percussion-- just beats, just background. The rest of the mix,
    however, is a bit more jazzy and quirky, blending piano, flute, organ vamps,
    vibraphones, and some basic samples. Then, of course, there's Abilities' ""abilities""--
    the wheels of steel-- which blend skillfully in the mix without sounding too
    apparent.  His restraint lends a good deal of coherence to the album.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, this simplistic sound also leads to a mix too weak and reserved for
    Eyedea's ample mic skills. Is there a rule against pairing complex, wicked beats
    with hype MCs?  Must we save these beats for Trick Daddy?  You get the feeling
    that any track with an MC as biting and incisive as Eyedea, with a vocal tone
    with as much attack as his, could really bounce. Eyedea would benefit from more
    bass, more breaks-- generally more flavor. For a large part of the album I was
    thinking ""remix,"" or possibly ""El-P.""</p><p>
    
    So the beats could use improvement, but the bottom line is Eyedea: he's good. His
    rhymes are dense, literate, focused, often surprising and always amusing. Expect
    much more out of the kid, especially given the undie resurgence of 2001 (Def Jux
    clan, in particular). In the meantime, <i>First Born</i>'s out there if you want
    it.</p></div>"|2885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2885-first-born/|7.9|Brad Haywood

    the Lofty Pillars' Michael Krassner, to provide the soundtrack for <i>Dutch
    Harbor</i>, a short documentary chronicling life on a remote Aleutian Island. Its
    core members-- Krassner, violinist Jessica Billey, Pinetop Seven bassist Ryan
    Hembrey, percussionist Glenn Kotche (now the drummer for Wilco), super-cellist
    Fred Lonberg-Holm, and ex-Souled American guitarist Scott Tuma-- created a unique
    fusion of country, jazz, classical, and post-rock noise, augmented by the inclusion
    of an itinerant band of musical cohorts. The resulting sound-- an eccentric,
    exquisite genre-bender-- became a kind of introspective late night standard for
    devotees of the beautifully cool, or coolly beautiful.</p><p>
    
    In early 2001, the core members reconvened after a hiatus (allowing for further
    entries on their already impressive resumes) to record <i>Two Brothers</i>, with
    the musical assistance of such luminaries as Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, Jim White and
    Mick Turner of the Dirty Three, and Jeff Parker of Tortoise and Isotope 217.</p><p>
    
    That <i>Two Brothers</i> doesn't sound a whole hell of a lot like anything else
    is commendable, but tricky.  It's a testament to Krassner's direction that the
    individual players coalesce into a single sound-- a true ensemble, if you will.
    However, the first blush consumer who buys this disc for the trademark sound of
    one of its contributors will find herself spending hours in front of the speakers
    trying to pick apart the sounds.  Unless your ear is a lot better than mine, you'll
    probably give up and consider that Krassner's decision to not list the players on
    each track merely forwards the premise of creating a true ensemble.</p><p>
    
    The thematic core here seems to be the subversion of traditional American song.
    This is fairly dark stuff, and I mean that quite literally. Krassner prefers the
    minor key, and most of the songs are performed at a dirge-like tempo, with
    Billey's plaintive violin and Lonberg-Holm's cello providing the meat of the
    melody.  The mournful variation ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" ushers in a
    trio of affecting cuts, including the haunting 18-minute title cut, ""The
    Half-Light"" (which features Gregorio's impressive clarinet work), and the
    gorgeous ""Requiem.""  A violin line that calls to mind a patch of desolate
    American Gothic will suddenly give way to a sampled siren.  Listener loss of
    context may ensue.</p><p>
    
    For an album that carefully dances around the edges of the avant-garde, <i>Two
    Brothers</i> never stings you with its pretensions.  Listening to this record is
    near effortless, and at the risk of sounding romantic and maudlin, I'll shy from
    using words like ""transcendent,"" even if that is what comes to mind.</p></div>"|892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/892-two-brothers/|8.9|Alison Fields

It strikes when you've spent
    too much time out of the spotlight.  The leader of the band stands up front telling
    every man, woman and child in the room to squeeze his lemon; the sideman hangs
    back and makes sure his bass stays in tune.  He helps load the t-shirts into the
    van, though his face is never on them.  Someone has to sell the show, and someone
    has to keep it together.</p><p>
    Miighty Flashlight is Mike Fellows.  Fellows played bass for seminal D.C. hardcore
    band Rites of Spring; he was one of the members who didn't later play in Fugazi.
    He's worked with such alt-country V.I.P.'s as Papa M, Will Oldham, and the Silver
    Jews.  Now armed only with a couple guitars, a Powerbook, and his down-home vocals,
    Fellows has a solo project to record and tour with his own songs.  His debut album
    is a short backyard barbecue, with high potential and mild impact.</p><p>
    Over his acoustic and electric guitars, Fellows gently adds samples with his
    Powerbook, managing to stray far from obvious or clumsy sounds.  And only upon
    close inspection do you notice how extensively he uses these sounds-- for accents,
    ambience, or even the foundation of a tune, as with the catchy flute hook of
    ""Ventilating Zephyrs,"" or the effects that gird the melody of ""Hala Hanan Di
    Halida.""  The instrumental ""Go On. Die. It's Easy"" layers subtle sounds over the
    acoustic guitars, from a low buzzing drone to a drum machine fill that may be
    <i>Miighty Flashlight</i>'s only cliché; on other tracks, the piano samples sound
    like they come from an upright sitting in Fellows' living room.  And his vocals--
    subdued, a little raw, and sometimes hard to interpret-- fit right in without
    knocking anything loose.  He sings like the guy at a party who mutters, ""Sure's
    been tough since the wife left.""  Like he wants you to know, but won't make a big
    deal of it.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the perfect arrangements make the album a bit too subtle. It doesn't
    rock and it doesn't ache.  ""Ballet Skool"" has grown on me, with its spare electric
    guitar line and its connotations of regrets and mistakes; but like most of the
    lyrics here, the words are cryptic and it's difficult to discern what Fellows is
    trying to say (""On top of ballet school / Don't let me be misdiagnosed"").  And as
    for the three instrumentals, ""Go On..."" is more than enough; the other two,
    ""Fatherland Focus"" and ""Forget This Space,"" are built on sub-John Fahey riffs
    that just coast by unconvincingly.  These songs might be likeable and masterfully
    crafted, but they could use an extra kick to keep us interested.</p></div>"|5282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5282-miighty-flashlight/|6.7|Chris Dahlen

    of our sentiment and find it irritating to have to endure another's.  Listening to
    Hefner's latest release, <i>Dead Media</i>, comes across as just such a laborious
    experience.  For whatever reason, Hefner made a conscious decision to strip down
    their sound, retreating to their bedrooms with analog synths and an eight-track
    recorder.  To cop Thoreau: ""to record so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to
    rout all that was not music, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive music
    into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.""  The result of this self-imposed
    hermeticism is neither mean nor sublime, but simply trite.  What's good for the
    soul isn't necessarily good for the ear.</p><p>
    Jan Hammer and Yaz are good in small doses, but they're mostly good for a chuckle.
    I might download a few tracks in homage to Sonny Crockett, Ricardo Tubbs and
    immortal Miami pastel cool, but I'd never want to sit through an entire album of
    hollow, pre-programmed beats and electronic handclaps.  With this release, Hefner
    apparently feels it's time for a revival of these clichés.</p><p>
<i>Dead Media</i> works on occasion, but primarily when Hefner revert to the
    traditional pop trio format of bass, guitar, drums.  Songs like ""The King of
    Summer"" show off the band's potential songwriting prowess, but most of the songs
    here are blatantly precious and generally as awkward as their primary subject
    matter-- puppy love and early teenage sexuality.  ""Peppermint Taste"" is a fine
    example, a reminiscence of a first kiss and feel-up under a tree which tries to
    counter the obvious and squeamish delivery with what I imagine are supposed to be
    biting comments: ""Now it's been twenty years, I bet you kiss real good/ I bet you
    kiss your banker like a banker's wife should.""  As with most of the attempts at
    irony throughout <i>Dead Media</i>, it falls flat.</p><p>
    The only track in this ""experimental mode"" that works is ""Alan Bean,"" a ""Major Tom""-style
    space adventure that's successful because the campy synths and space sounds give
    the song a cartoonish quality that belies its desperation and hope.  There are
    also some passable songs, like ""Junk"" and ""When the Angels Play Their Drums,"" but
    then there are others like ""China Crisis"" which are handled so ineptly that they
    inspire three solid minutes of cringing.</p><p>
    It's clear that Hefner's intention was to take complete control of the creative
    process by living with these machines for a while, and to create a little
    masterpiece of Brian Wilson-esque simplicity and charm.  But obviously, they're
    not quite so deft with this equipment as Wilson was, and it all comes off as a
    bunch of sophomoric tinkering.  If they felt that this amateurish sound would
    illicit a flood of vintage memories and a collective sentimental sigh of
    recognition, they were just plain wrong.  For me, it actually has the opposite
    effect: a shriek of recognition and a dash for the stop button.  You're better
    off sticking with vintage Pet Shop Boys and ABC.</p></div>"|3802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3802-dead-media/|4.2|Nathan Rooney

    Bill Doss (formerly of the Olivia Tremor Control) really likes the Beatles, the
    sun, and psychedelic drugs.  And with good reason.  In small doses, all three are
    great things, liable to cheer you up, or at the very least, illuminate a situation
    in a way uniquely their own. But too much of any of these things can be a problem.
    Too much sun will give you cancer. Too much Beatles will leave your mind a mess of
    muddled harmonies, celebrity worship and lame conspiracy theories. Too many
    psychedelic drugs will turn you into a self-obsessed freak (like, say, Neu!'s
    Klaus Dinger).</p><p>
    
    Too much. This is a problem that the Bill Doss has. There's lots of good stuff on
    <i>Age of the Sun</i>, the new album from his new-ish band the (ahem) Sunshine
    Fix.  It's just that sometimes, there's a bit too much of it.</p><p>
    
    Take that sun, for example. It's in the name of the band; it's in the title of the
    album; it's one of the first and last words sung on the album; and more than half
    the songs appropriate it as a theme. Now, doubtless, the sun plays an important
    role in all of our lives (the loyal vampire portion of Pitchfork's readership
    notwithstanding), but this sort of obsessiveness is just plain unhealthy. Unhealthy
    and tiresome. Just as a bright, sunny day can come as a slap in the face if
    you're in the wrong mood, so, too, can this constant elaboration on the same theme
    get a little irritating.</p><p>
    
    The music, on the other hand, doesn't, which comes as something of a surprise. It's
    not everyday that I, a bitter, wearied critic, stumble upon pop music varied enough
    that it not only grabs my attention, but also hangs onto it.  Granted, there's
    nothing on <i>Age of the Sun</i> that's quite up to par with the work of Doss'
    former bandmate (Circulatory System's Will Cullen Hart), but then, little more
    than constant disappointment can come from expecting every record to be a
    masterpiece.</p><p>
    
    But <i>Age of the Sun</i> does have some very strong moments.  Like the two wobbly,
    distorted guitars that do battle on the instrumental track ""Inside the Nebula""
    while crackling static and a sturdy bassline keep time. As this short number nears
    its end, a simple piano melody lingers in the background, before everything cuts
    out, then back in, then back out, then back in, then out for good. If that bit of
    piano sounds familiar, it's because it's playing the same faux-ragtime bit that
    served as a bridge between ""Everything is Waking""-- one of the most OTC-sounding
    songs on the album, replete with a melancholy refrain with vocal harmonizing and
    guitar riffs right off <i>The White Album</i>-- and ""Digging to China,"" one of the
    more straightforward tracks here.</p><p>
    
    The Sunshine Fix is a bit more straightforward than OTC or Circulatory System.
    Sure, lots of the trademarks remain-- songs linked together by stray musical
    digressions, short bits of strangeness between songs, recurring singsong melodies,
    etc. But there's more focus here on the pop than the psychedelic. That's not to
    say <i>Age of the Sun</i> isn't without its out-there psychedelic moments, just
    that Doss is more interested in layering piles of horns, guitars, bass, drums,
    strings, organs, harmonizing vocals and feedback on top of each other for that
    glorious wall of sound effect than he is in twisting your mind around in circles
    from chasing after stray bits of hallucinatory noise gone awry.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, this is a pretty solid effort, especially from the man often assumed
    to be the lesser half of the OTC equation. Sure, there are moments that get
    annoying-- like ""Le Roi Soleil,"" which ends the album by stretching one syllable's
    vocal harmony over the course of twenty minutes.  And sure, the whole ordeal could
    benefit from a bit of thematic variety.  But there are also lots of strong moments,
    like the way the simple acoustic number, ""Cycles of Time,"" serves as a breather
    following the swarming grandiose of ""72 Years,"" <i>Age of the Sun</i>'s grand
    finale (provided you discount ""Le Roi"").</p><p>
<i>Age of the Sun</i> may not be the defining achievement of pop music that
    <i>Black Foliage</i> was, and it may not reach quite the heights of his counterpart
    Hart's finest efforts, but it's still one of the stronger straight-up pop albums
    I've heard in a while. At his worst, Doss is prone to over-indulgence. But at his
    best, he proves himself a more-than-capable songwriter and arranger. If he ever
    learns to respect his limitations, why, there's no telling what he might achieve.</p></div>"|7592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7592-age-of-the-sun/|7.9|David M. Pecoraro

Not only is he a great
    songwriter, responsible for half of the music of the Posies, but he's also kept
    his plate constantly full over the last decade, working with everyone from REM
    to Big Star to Scott McCaughey to Ringo Starr.  The Posies are the hardest working
    defunct band in show business-- Stringfellow and fellow Posie John Auer have
    released more material since the band's breakup than most bands release in an
    entire career.</p><p>
    
    And in the midst of all this, Ken found time to start yet another band-- a group
    called Saltline that only managed to record one EP before splitting.  This left
    Stringfellow with a bunch of songs just lying around doing nothing.  So, he penned
    up a few more and put them all to work on his second solo album, <i>Touched</i>.
    True to form, it's not a bad batch of tunes.</p><p>
    
    Stringfellow allows the country tendencies that have always lurked in his
    songwriting to come to the fore on the opener ""Down Like Me.""  Ron Preston's steel
    guitar swells in and out of the mix and drummer Eric Marshall keeps things moving
    at a quick clip as Stringfellow serves up one of the sticky melodies we've by now
    come to expect from him.  Mitch Easter's production is clean and uncluttered, but
    it sometimes lacks the punch of the Posies' best efforts, like 1993's excellent
    <i>Frosting on the Beater</i>.</p><p>
    
    ""This One's on You"" pulls back the reins and turns back the clock to roughly the
    time when Bernie Leadon was still in the Eagles.  One of the Posies' main
    strengths was always the harmonies of Auer and Stringfellow.  Here, minus Auer,
    Stringfellow simply layers his own voice and while this works well enough, there's
    a certain balance that Auer's voice brought to the harmonies of the Posies that's
    lacking on <i>Touched</i>.  On his own, Stringfellow's voice also has a somewhat
    alarming tendency to sound like Timothy B. Schmidt on the high notes, but
    this only happens rarely.</p><p>
    
    Stringfellow naturally includes a few of the power-pop gems that he does so well,
    like the Sloan-esque ""Find Yourself Alone.""  At first glance, the song is catchy
    and well-performed, with a monster chorus, but a closer listen reveals several
    piano and Rhodes tracks filling out the background, adding immensely to the
    overall texture of the song.  If only there were radio stations somewhere that
    would play this stuff.</p><p>
    
    ""Uniforms"" begins over a bed of cello and violin, but quickly segues into loping
    pop full of cleanly strummed guitars, harpsichord, and even a bit of distant
    clip-clop percussion nicked straight from <i>Pet Sounds</i>.  Atmospheric synths
    gradually enter the mix, only to give way to a piano interlude that lays the
    groundwork for the last few verses.  The rhythm pushes forward harder than before,
    and layers of synth wash underneath Stringfellow's multi-tracked voice.  It's an
    impressive little opus that uses a keen sense of arrangement to its fullest
    advantage.</p><p>
    
    ""Sparrow"" is the best of an impressive quartet of classic power-pop songs with
    one of the album's finest melodies topping another inventive arrangement.
    Stringfellow makes use of his lowest range in the pre-chorus over fuzzed-out
    guitars and organs, and offers some impressive guitar and keyboard work in the
    instrumental bridge.  The Hammond-soaked ""Reveal Love"" comes down a notch,
    eschewing guitar entirely in the verses, but still offering a massive chorus
    designed to rattle around your head for days afterward.</p><p>
    
    But while the more upbeat numbers on <i>Touched</i> are uniformly flawless,
    things get spotty when Stringfellow departs from that route. ""One Morning"" is
    a fine enough acoustic song, full of nicely layered vocals and a great melody,
    but it's followed by ""Spanish Waltz,"" a song that feels somewhat labored.  It
    veers between some forced distorted passages and vaguely psychedelic sections
    with odd little guitar parts battling with Stringfellow's otherwise good vocal
    melody.  There's a bombast to the song that's simply unbecoming a songwriter like
    Stringfellow, whose primary strength is melody.</p><p>
    
    It's followed by ""Fireflies,"" a quiet, pensive song where the guitar and drums are
    actually more prominent than the vocals.  It works well as a mood piece or
    interlude, but little else.  But it's on ""The Lover's Hymn"" where he really veers
    off course.  The aforementioned Timothy B. Schmidt resemblance hinted at earlier
    is in a full bloom here, and the song practically sounds like an outtake from the
    sessions for ""The Long Run.""  At more than five minutes, it's extremely overlong,
    and never really develops itself beyond the organ-coated verses, with the
    exception of some somewhat interesting instrumental bits presented in lieu of a
    chorus.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, Stringfellow gets his bearings again for the closer, ""Here's to the
    Future,"" and ending <i>Touched</i> in the same territory that Big Star's third
    album occupied 25 years ago.  What begins as an acoustic song is shrouded in a
    blanket of analog synthesizer during the crescendos between verses, and Marshall
    punctuates it with orchestral percussion.  It's a fitting close to a fine solo
    effort that's not afraid to take a few chances.  No one really knows at this point
    what will become of the Posies, but as long as Stringfellow keeps putting out
    music in some form, the future of power-pop looks okay.</p></div>"|7535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7535-touched/|7.5|Joe Tangari

    two weeks, each attempt more futile than the last. I considered keeping a diary
    of listening (and actually went so far as to do it on a number of occasions),
    piecing together thoughts and hoping something cohesive would come of it.
    Re-reading my scribbles, I realized that it was like fitting the jumbled pieces
    of a puzzle together. Every entry referenced something wholly other than what
    had preceded it. Inevitably, part of it became personal; so I nixed it. Still,
    the task became a vital part of this, almost as if I had lived inside the sounds
    of <i>Neon Golden</i>, drifting in and out of song, mixing familiar with unknown,
    moving above and beneath the textures and never completely keeping time. In the
    end, it's apt that this resulted from a Notwist record. The last decade for them
    was full of shifting movements.</p><p>
    Beginning in Weilheim, Germany in the early 90s as a heavy metal outfit, Markus
    and Micha Acher, along with drummer Martin Messerschmid, released two albums
    filled with pounding drums and guitar solos (<i>The Notwist</i> and <i>Nook</i>)
    before almost abandoning it completely. However, with <i>Nook</i>, things had
    already started to change. Interests moved away from thudding power riffs and
    toward the direction of complex rhythms and structures. Even so, to listen to
    those albums now, most people would find it difficult to believe the same band
    made this new disc.</p><p>
    In the mid-90s, the Notwist finally got an American distributor with <i>12</i>,
    on the now-defunct Zero Hour label.  With that, they began to explore even more
    textures in their sound, enlisting Martin Gretschmann (aka Console) to help with
    production and add his special electronic touch.  Resulting in a more poppy sound
    for the group (some might even call it indie rock), <i>12</i>'s beauty is startling
    from beginning to end.</p><p>
    With Martin Console now in tow as a full-time member, <i>Shrink</i> was a huge
    step into the world of electronic music and sounded almost completely unlike
    anything else made at the time. Mixing rock and pop with free jazz, old-timey
    folk, jagged minimalist beats and just about anything else you could toss in,
    I don't have any problems saying now that the record was ahead of its time. To
    top it off, the shame in it all is that very few took notice; Zero Hour went belly
    up (rendering <i>12</i> and <i>Shrink</i> virtually impossible to find in record shops
    these days), and the Notwist went back to Germany and sort of disappeared for a
    few years.</p><p>
    So it seemed. Console never really slowed down, releasing a ton of solo projects
    (one of which was 1999's Matador-released <i>Rocket in the Pocket</i>), remixing
    just about everyone, and doing the programming and production on possibly the best
    track from Björk's <i>Vespertine</i>, ""Heirloom.""  The list of Notwist side
    projects became quite lengthy, too: Tied and Tickled Trio (sax player Johannes
    Enders' continuing project), Village of Savoonga, Potawatomi and Lali Puna, to
    name a few.  So, after four years of what only seemed like hiding, the Acher
    brothers and the Martins (Console and Messerschmid) return with <i>Neon Golden</i>.
    Their website says it was worth the wait. And, well, it's true.</p><p>
<i>Neon Golden</i> is replete with textured sounds, drifting (and occasionally
    driving) pulsations, and mesmerizing hypno-rhythms. It's been quite a while since
    the last time I actually felt I've been with a record like this. Sounds odd, but
    that's exactly the feeling I've received over the last two weeks. And when you've
    got that much time to spend with a record, it becomes an entity in and of itself.
    Most times with a record review, you get a few precursory listens and then by
    number five or six, you're spitting out a review. Not so here. With well over
    fifty listens to this disc, it's like a relationship has begun to spring forth
    out of the ether. I guess you could say <i>Neon Golden</i> and me have become
    well acquainted and it's already akin to hanging with an old friend. Given that
    amount of time, realizations occur. One of my first was that, in many ways, this
    record is about textures: electronic bleats, pulsing waves, the mixture of organic
    instruments with digital blips and loops, and most notably the serenity of Markus
    Acher's voice.</p><p>
    While Acher's singing has always been appealing to me, it wasn't until this album
    that I finally recognized something and, for you lyric analysts, it's probably not
    a good thing. I've found myself spending more time listening to Acher's voice than
    paying attention to what exactly he's singing about. In some ways, it's similar to
    Arto Lindsay. On albums like <i>Mundo Civilizado</i>-- when he's singing in
    Portuguese, it's unclear exactly what he's talking about. Yet his ability to
    mesmerize and captivate the listener with his singing can be simply haunting, and
    damn if his voice just doesn't ooze sex appeal. A very similar thing often occurs
    when I'm listening to Acher. The songs are sung in English. I know the words and
    I can sing along. Thing is, my attention becomes devoted to the way his phrases
    are formed, his ability to roll words off his tongue, the manner in which certain
    syllables, consonants and vowels are stressed, and the way familiar English words
    all at once become foreign. On ""This Room,"" there's a moment at around the 1:30
    mark where the driving percussion suddenly comes to a delirious halt and leaving
    only Acher's voice imbedded in a wave of electronic gurgles and throbbing beats.
    The track is rendered into two halves here, Acher's voice cut-up and pieced back
    together in a dizzying loop, bouncing off itself in nonsense half-syllables and
    creating a split-second feel of nausea-inducing vertigo.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, a track like ""One Step Inside Doesn't Mean You'll Understand"" is
    comprised of plucked strings atop a low saxophone moan while hisses and crackles
    burble just below the surface, waiting for the end of the song, and fading out
    with the hum of nothing but fuzz, as if the stylus was just caught in a locked
    groove. Prior to that fading hum, thin layers of sound begin to unfurl themselves,
    something that transpires on almost every track-- whether it be the distinguishing
    Notwist banjo, clanking percussion or the layer upon layer of electronics. Even on
    <i>Neon Golden</i>'s most driving track, ""Pilot,"" the band allows space for those
    resonating electronic hums to break through.</p><p>
    And then, another realization. The Notwist have an uncanny knack for allowing
    their compositions room to breathe, creating lush sonic textures. Dynamic numbers
    like ""Pilot"" or ""Pick Up the Phone"" come off as thoughtful and unhurried, songs
    transitioning into each other with languid movements. ""Pick Up the Phone"" is
    awash in spastic, pointy-headed beats and it sounds like the feel of crumpled and
    un-crumpled candy wrappers. With Markus Acher singing in what sometimes sound like
    barely hushed whispers, <i>Neon Golden</i> begins to take on an introspective
    beauty, almost as if everything (the musicians, the singer, the music) is lost in
    contemplative thought.</p><p>
    Nowhere is this pensiveness more present than in tracks like ""Neon Golden"" or
    ""Off the Rails.""  The muted, tranquil beauty of an acoustic guitar and Markus
    Acher crooning ""this is all I know"" gently over electronic washes of sound in the
    latter make for lullaby material. ""Neon Golden,"" on the other hand, begins as a
    gritty dirge, containing a deep saxophone groan, plucked acoustic guitar and banjo,
    and the mantra-like title chant. As it progresses, though, the song begins to be
    taken over by drops of scattered percussion, rhythmic drums, congas, and the
    murmuring buzz of Console's electronic manipulations. At first, my feelings for
    ""Consequence"" were ambivalent, but now I see that it's the perfect choice for a
    closing song. Markus Acher's lovely, plaintive moan of ""Leave me hypnotized,
    love/ Leave me paralyzed, love,"" is the one time when the lyrics stand against
    the backdrop of the song, stark and revelatory.  <i>Neon Golden</i> can do exactly
    what he's singing: it leaves you mesmerized, lost in meditative thought and
    captivated by the grainy, exquisite textures.</p><p>
<i>Neon Golden</i> would be a staggering feat for any band, much less a band most
    people had long since forgotten about (or maybe never really knew). A decade into
    their career, the Notwist have created a masterpiece by pulling the same trick
    they pulled on <i>Shrink</i>: mixing things that might not seem to fit together
    into a beautiful, seamless whole.  Again, the unfortunate thing is that anyone
    outside Europe is going to have a difficult time getting their hands on a copy.
    If you do find one, be prepared to pay, as City Slang stuff just ain't that cheap
    in the USA.  So, why haven't labels like Mute or Communion or Darla jumped on
    getting this available for domestic distribution yet?  A more obvious choice would
    even be Matador, who recently released one of Console's albums domestically. As
    of right now, the Notwist have released the record of the year. It's a shame that
    most people might not have a chance to hear it.</p></div>"|5845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5845-neon-golden/|9.2|Luke Buckman

    chances are, you were a Braid fan.  Too young to have caught Smashing Pumpkins
    before they mutated into arena-rock dinosaurs, and too rambunctious to chin-stroke
    along with McEntire and O'Rourke, the angst-filled masses turned to Braid.  You
    could count on the Champaign foursome to play through the area once every month
    or two, filling up the Metro or the Fireside Bowl with bobbing heads and squinty
    rock-out faces.  Melodramatic lyrics, Fugazi-esque start/stops, time signature
    chaos, and an excellent balance of hardcore mentality and catchy melodicism--
    what more could a Midwestern eighteen year-old ask for?</p><p>
    
    I know because I was there, pumping my fist to ""First Day Back"" with the rest of
    you.  And that's why I can't decide whether I'm disappointed or just plain angry
    about the vanilla ice-cream blandness of <i>Everynight Fire Works</i>.  See, Hey
    Mercedes is 75% of what once was Braid-- their answer to ""Saved by the Bell: The
    College Years,"" if you will.  When Braid broke up in early 2000, I took comfort
    in the fact that three-quarters of the band would continue on under a new moniker,
    without the services of guitarist/screamy-guy Chris Broach.  Their first,
    self-titled EP was an unimpressive effort, but live shows featured a number of
    unrecorded songs with potential.</p><p>
    
    Then Hey Mercedes broke from Polyvinyl Records, the home of such respectable
    Midwesterners as AM/FM and Aloha, for Vagrant Records, the home of critically
    acclaimed artists like... hmmm... help me out here... Snapcase?  Well, anyway,
    given Vagrant's habit of churning out slick pop-punk product for chain-wallet
    accessorisors that just came down off a bad Blink-182 bender, the warning flags
    were raised.</p><p>
    
    And indeed, these warning flags proved accurate upon the release of <i>Everynight
    Fire Works</i>.  Under the increasingly commercial-minded guidance of J. Robbins,
    every rough edge is polished up to a shimmering, radio-friendly gleam.  Close your
    eyes, and you can imagine most of these songs on MTV, maybe with the band in funny
    wigs and playing to a house full of underwear-clad teenagers.</p><p>
    
    Still, Robbins helmed the boards on Braid's final and finest full-length, <i>Frame
    and Canvas</i>, so the blame cannot rest solely with him.  Frontman Bob Nanna
    seems determined to dumb down his songs to reach a wider audience, trading in the
    polyrhythms and unusual dynamics of old for power chords, power chords, power
    chords.  Sure, there's a few stutter-steps in tracks like ""A-List Actress"" and
    ""The Frowning of a Lifetime,"" but more common are songs like ""Our Weekend Starts
    on Wednesday"" and ""What You're Up Against,"" which roll along with little variation
    in tempo or volume.</p><p>
    
    The one-dimensional nature of the album leads me to say words I never thought I'd
    utter: I miss Chris Broach.  While his contributions to Braid albums often seemed
    limited to emphatically yelling ""yeah!"" every once in a while, Hey Mercedes is
    sorely lacking the hard vocal counterpoint Broach would play to Nanna's sensitive
    guy act.  Also absent is the intricate instrumental interplay between Broach and
    Nanna, as guitarist Mark Dawursk adds little to indicate that Hey Mercedes even
    needs two six-strings.</p><p>
    
    Frustratingly, a couple songs still manage to strike direct hits on my old
    Braid-lovin' soul.  ""Every Turn"" features the kind of acrobatically catchy vocal
    Nanna used to specialize in writing, with a great, crunchy chorus tailor-made for
    the at-home rockout.  Album closer ""Let's Go Blue"" layers a tiny little riff over
    a chugging chord progression, and works well until resorting to that most tired
    of devices, the bass and drums breakdown.</p><p>
    
    81.8% of <i>Everynight Fire Works</i>, however, inspires nothing more than a yawn
    and bittersweet nostalgia.  The mediocrity reaches its apex with ""Quit,"" five
    minutes so lacking in hooks and creativity that it feels ten times as long, even
    before the textbook false-ending and buildup coda.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it's completely possible that I've just outgrown the target audience
    for Nanna &amp; Co.  Somewhere in Suburbia, I'm guessing there's a fifteen year-old
    kid just now discovering Hey Mercedes and thinking they're the greatest thing
    ever.  More power to little Ricky-- he could be listening to a lot worse.  And
    maybe my dissatisfaction means I'm actually disappointed and angry with myself,
    for outgrowing that rockin' inner teenager and becoming a crotchety old foge.</p><p>
    
    No, wait, that's not right.  I'm disappointed and angry about Hey Mercedes'
    impossibly middling debut album.  Sorry, don't know what got into me there.</p></div>"|3847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3847-everynight-fire-works/|3.0|Rob Mitchum

    They are purists, continually honing their craft and chipping away at the excess,
    going on the assumption that a lean and efficient music machine is better equipped
    to tune into the Ultimate Vibration. These methods have led both bands toward a
    polished and pleasant sound, relatively far afield from their coarse four-track
    beginnings. And there's no doubting the efficacy of this refinement, as
    <i>Consciousness</i> and <i>The Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid</i> were
    excellent albums that ranked with each band's finest.</p><p>
    
    And then there's Sunroof!. Where other bands see drone as a state of relaxation
    in which the listener finds himself in harmony with his surroundings, Sunroof!
    channels the raw, unknowable patterns of nature into a music that's dense, harsh,
    loud and endless. Miles removed from the soothing hum, these monolithic sound
    constructions seem hacked from the world of ambient noise with a dull hatchet.
    They're crude, shapeless, and drooping with stray connective tissue.  And yet,
    in their own way, they're also very beautiful.</p><p>
    
    Before we get into the music on <i>Bliss</i>, a little background. Sunroof! come
    from a music community seemingly designed with the obsessive music fan in mind.
    Those looking for an obscure psychedelic noise scene populated by enigmatic
    characters prone to issuing scores of hyper-limited records to pad a massive and
    completely unmanageable discography need look no further than the Skullflower.
    The band was formed in rural England in 1985, and members went on to perform and
    record in various configurations under the names Ramleh, Consumer Electronics, Ax,
    Novatron, Ascension, and JFK, and that's just for starters. Sunroof! is the name
    ex-Skullflower guitarist Mathew Bower now uses for his solo projects (he previously
    released albums under the name Total).  The 2xCD <i>Bliss</i> is actually the
    second album released by Sunroof! in 2001. The first was the vinyl-only <i>Sad
    Frog Wind</i>, which featured two side-long compositions full of guitar feedback,
    synthesizer oscillations, and assorted bells and chimes. It was an impressive
    record, but <i>Bliss</i> is more diverse, and ultimately, packs a bigger punch.</p><p>
    
    The first two tracks make up one long piece bearing the intriguing title ""Columbine
    Kisses."" It begins with a half-second of bass rumble and then a cheap, tinny drum
    machine taps out a wobbly rhythm, seeming somehow feeble and out of place next to
    the drone. Waves of feedback eventually submerge the rhythm box, and yet it remains
    barely audible a few leagues below the drone, managing to mark the time amid the
    relentless noise. Though the track will strike some as difficult listening, Sunroof!
    brilliantly walks the tightrope between noise and drone music proper; <i>Bliss</i>
    never comes close to Merzbow territory (upping the overall playability), but always
    maintains an abrasive edge that keeps the music firmly in the foreground.</p><p>
    
    ""Gold Carnation Legacy"" is one of a few tracks built around the kind of oscillating
    synth drone that anchored Spacemen 3's epic ""Suicide."" The fluttering tones
    accelerate and decelerate unpredictably, and woven through the spaces are bowed
    strings and guitars that sound like whale songs. ""Distoria"" emphasizes percussion
    and unorthodox guitar technique (one noise might be an electric guitar being sawed
    in half, another guitar is struck to sound like a series of bells), revealing the
    strong influence of the Indian raga on Bower's music. ""The Blue Sky of China"" is
    even more overt in this respect, coaxing the long, winding melody lines of a sitar
    into a bed of distortion.</p><p>
    
    ""Bells"" is the rare slice of tranquility on the first disc of <i>Bliss</i>, as
    comparatively tame guitar feedback is sculpted into what could be an aural essay
    on the healing properties of sunlight. The shorter second disc of <i>Bliss</i>
    comes a bit closer to evoking its title. ""Dirty Joke from Outer Space"" is a
    collection of bubbly synth oscillations mixed with bird sounds, and when sheets
    of feedback ultimately rise in the mix, they're relaxed and welcoming. ""Dance of
    the Blessed Spirits"" serves to highlight the homespun nature of the Sunroof!
    project, as the voice of a child near the microphone talks and sings along with
    the extended tones.</p><p>
    
    This track, like many others throughout <i>Bliss</i>, begins and ends abruptly.
    While this is probably due to the rudimentary nature of the recording environment,
    these jarring transitions give the illusion that these pieces actually go on
    forever, and that the listener just happened to drop in on them for a few minutes.
    I like to think that somewhere in the world, at this very moment, another Sunroof!
    drone is raging. And I can only hope there's a tape machine nearby to capture it.</p></div>"|7586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7586-bliss/|8.3|Mark Richard-San

You don't tug on Superman's
    cape.  You don't spit into the wind.  You don't pull the mask off that ol' Lone
    Ranger, and you don't mess around with freeform radio.  After all, freeform radio--
    real, no-rules, no-boundaries freeform radio-- is about as common in playlisted
    corporate America as a trustworthy politician.  So, on June 11th, 1984, when
    listeners tuned into ""Over the Edge,"" the weekly freeform show hosted by so-called
    ""sonic outlaws"" and collage artists supreme Negativland only to hear 70s schmaltz
    standbys like ""Billy, Don't Be a Hero"" and ""Rock Me Gently,"" it's understandable
    why they might be upset.</p><p>
    
    Though they may be better known for their studio releases and legal battles,
    Negativland's probably spent more time over the last two decades at a small
    California freeform station than they have in any studio or courtroom. Their
    shows are as unpredictable as they come; long mixes full of chopped-up pop
    culture, oddball characters, weird pranks and audience participation (callers
    to the station are generally placed immediately on the air and allowed to
    interact however they please, so long as they don't say the forbidden word:
    ""Hello"").  A few such moments are included in this package. In a segment called
    ""Ringo Starr is Dead,"" the group tells their audience that Starr has died of a
    drug overdose and feigns a tribute, chopping up and destroying Beatles music
    while callers grieve, express doubt, and eventually curse them as their hoax
    comes unraveled.</p><p>
    
    But on that fateful day in June, something went wrong.  All anyone really knew
    for certain was that some asshole by the name of Dick Vaughn had taken over
    Negativland's time slot, and where previously they had tuned in for hours of
    chaotic unpredictable sound experiments, now there was only ""Muskrat Love."" What
    many listeners didn't realize was that Dick Vaughn was little more than a creation
    of Negativland, the latest in a long line of characters. Why did no one suspect
    that Dick was the work of these well-known pranksters? Most probably did. But
    lots of people bought into it.  And the angry phone calls preserved in this, a new,
    expanded two-disc reissue of one of Negativland's finest ""Over the Edge""
    releases, live on as proof.</p><p>
    
    Other Negativland creations stop by for moments of delightful radio trickery, too,
    including visits from longtime staples like the irrepressibly irate homosexual
    Weatherman, nasally cultural reviewer Crosley Bendix, and the gluttonous Dean of
    Psychiatric Broadcasting, Dr. Oslo Norway. But the real focus here is Dick--
    probably among the least beloved of any of Negativland's characters-- an
    ambitious-yet-tasteless radio personality and incurable phone prankster. The
    first disc of this release presents moments from ""California Superstation,"" Dick's
    first misguided attempt at radio, wherein he plays a bunch of vapid, irritating
    games with the audience and manages to irritate an entire listening base in a mere
    five hours. Also included is an assortment of Dick Vaughn's phone pranks.
    Apparently not content with destroying his own radio shows, Dick was notorious
    for calling up other, real radio shows, and wrecking havoc on the air.</p><p>
    
    Disc Two documents ""Moribund Music of the 70s""-- purportedly the first-ever 70s
    nostalgia radio show-- hosted by Vaughn in 1984, splicing vocal segments of Dick's
    show with various listener phonecalls (both hateful and praising) and assorted
    strange noises. These clips are interspersed with recordings of off-air phone
    surveys, where one member of the group asks unsuspecting listeners what they
    think of Vaughn's show while the rest of the group constantly interrupts the
    conversation with a barrage of mostly vulgar soundbytes (which, of course,
    everyone but the baffled survey-taker fails to notice).</p><p>
    
    I enjoyed these moments thoroughly, but then, I might be biased. To the
    non-Negativland-obsessed, pranks like these, while certainly fun, might eventually
    get a little old. Without the thrill of listening to such shenanigans live, they
    do lose some of their spark and vitality. And as with any comedy album, what's
    funny the first time around may not sit so well on repeated listens. Still, the
    compilation works as a history lesson and it makes what comes next that much
    more amazing.</p><p>
    
    The last quarter of this 150+ minute-long collection is dedicated to Dick's death
    (in a fiery plane crash, no less) and his subsequent postmortem appearances
    (which include a dying plea captured on the flight recorded, and tapes prepared in
    case of untimely death). Negativland pays homage to the recently deceased in a
    segment called ""Dick is Dead,"" a truly bizarre collage which is equal parts
    minced 70s cheese, black box recordings from plummeting planes, strange characters,
    crying babies and funky basslines.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, this set is not unlike the rest of Negativland's ""Over the Edge""
    collections.  Without a doubt, it contains moments of sheer brilliance, but
    there's so much material to wade through that it might as well come with a sticker
    that says ""For True Obsessives Only.""  Fans of the group's antics will inevitably
    eat this up, but for those just coming to the table for the first time, one of the
    group's more proper studio-bound efforts might serve as a better appetizer (for
    what it's worth, <i>Escape from Noise</i> and the now out-of-print <i>U2</i> are
    the classics, though <i>A Big 10-8 Place</i> is my personal favorite).</p><p>
    
    Of course,
    for a certain crowd-- those who, like myself, believe radio can be something more
    than the record industry's favorite whore-- there's a certain magic to Dick Vaughn.
    Even in its less-than-stellar moments, <i>Moribund Music of the 70s</i> is still
    oddly fascinating. There's always a certain risk inherent-- a feeling that not
    only is it possible that everything might go wrong live on the air, but that it's
    likely, too-- that puts these recordings on a plane far removed from most anything
    else going out over the airwaves these days. For those who still believe that art
    can be dangerous, that there's still a place in this world for true no-holds-barred
    freeform radio, Negativland continue to reign both as innovators and as
    inspirations.</p></div>"|5735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5735-over-the-edge-vol-4-dick-vaughns-moribund-music-of-the-70s/|7.5|David M. Pecoraro

As the
    exemplary reissue label Blood and Fire demonstrates with their every release, dub
    is all about the clash of human creativity and technological ineptitude. King
    Tubby and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry were pioneers because they overcame the gulf between
    their imaginations and the thrift-store sound equipment they had access to. Thus,
    Tubby relied on the beloved primitive sound effects of accidental tape-hiss and
    drop-outs as much he relied on the echo chamber. Very few present-day digi-dubbers
    resist the temptation to defuzz and cleanse their rootical offerings. Like Ryan
    Moore's Twilight Circus Dub Sound System and Oswald von Moritz's Rhythm and Sound
    project, the Austrian quartet Sofa Surfers relish and emulate the mystical lo-fi
    glamour of classic dub.</p><p>
    But unlike Moore and von Moritz, Sofa Surfers are not mere copyists. <i>Cargo</i>,
    the band's unnerving and astounding debut album, plotted a course from Crooklyn
    dub (""Container"") and Ital wisdom (""Sweat"") to Massive Attack-ish future-funk
    trip-hop (""The Low Rider"") and avant-metal Rastafarian hip-hop (""Beans and Rice"").
    The remix album, <i>Constructions</i>, magnified <i>Cargo</i>'s oppressive
    hydroponic power with dubs and reworkings by such sun-shy, sunken-cheeked masters
    of the out-there, slo-mo roller as Spectre, Mad Professor, Howie B and Eardrum.</p><p>
<i>Encounters</i> is no doubt intended as a continuation of the collaborative
    aesthetic of <i>Constructions</i>.  Yet, despite Sofa Surfers' valiant attempts,
    the record suffers occasionally from thread-bare talent having a shoddy go at
    underground hip-hop or slouchy lounge ballads. In such cases, Sofa Surfers
    relegate themselves to providing moody soundscapes for their guests to faff around
    in. However, when they encounter true talent, the quartet approaches the essential
    toughness of <i>Cargo</i>.</p><p>
    This record opens with ""Formula,"" featuring would-be macker Sensational and his
    claims about being the ""real deal"" and ""too much for ya.""  Sensational rides a
    crisp drum-track similar to <i>Cargo</i>'s ""Container"" and Axelrod-y breaks that
    DJ Shadow and other crate-diggers have been appropriating for years. The
    thesaurus-plundering wordplay continues with Oddateee's ""21st Century Army.""
    Oddateee's message is the standard vision of a <i>Blade Runner</i> future.
    But despite the Corporation's oppression of masses, Oddateee lives up to his
    <i>nom de guerre</i> by proclaiming himself an oddity who's as ""large as an
    aircraft carrier."" Wow. What a flat simile. Oddateee isn't exactly in Saul
    Williams' league.</p><p>
    ""River Blues,"" features the droopy, drawled vocal talent of Jeb Loy Nichols.  The
    cut previously made an appearance on <i>Sincerely Yours</i>, Klein Records' most
    recent label compilation, but failed to shine much amongst all that disc's fluff.
    Here, in its true context, it is, unsurprisingly, not much better.  But at least
    the scratchadelic bridge makes some sort of sense after Sensational's and Oddateee's
    raps. Still, the Surfers only exert themselves about as much as Nicols, losing
    steam after drudging up a heap of worn-out-groove fuzz-hiss.</p><p>
    It takes the dancehall chat of DJ Collage and ""Babylon Tymes"" to get things
    bouncing out of complaisance. While Collage doesn't have the gruff fury of
    Elephant Man or the righteous zeal of Sizzla, his Babylon-vexing patter spurs
    Sofa Surfers into laying down a feisty echo-abundant roller.  Then comes the
    avant-garde illbience of ""Twisted Tongue,"" serving as a nice transition between
    the routine of the disc's first half to the more adventurous and successful
    second.</p><p>
    Featuring the dynamic duo of Techno Animal and 2nd Gen collaborator Dälek,
    ""Elusive Scripts"" bucks as ""Formula"" should have.  Dälek doesn't have to fake
    like Sensational. He's a thoroughly credible MC who doesn't rely on dopey bragging
    rhymes to proclaim his greatness-- he shows rather than tells. With ""See the Light,""
    Junior Delgado makes an irrefutable case for him to take over Horace Andy's
    position in Massive Attack. With talent like Delgado, Sofa Surfers have to come
    up with something special. Using Massive Attack's crawling version of John Holt's
    ""Man Next Door"" as a model, ""See the Light"" is unmistakably this album's standout
    cut. Dawna Lee comes on like a super-sultry Dawn Penn, thus making ""Witness"" a
    knock-out gorgeous R&amp;B; ballad. But in direct opposition to the beauty of ""Witness,""
    the collaboration with ex-Pop Group member and On U Sound System affiliate Mark
    Stewart, ""Home Truth,"" is a hamfisted industrial dub rocker.  Stewart, it seems,
    is never going to achieve the distinction of his 1990 electro-dub masterpiece
    <i>Metatron</i>, and Sofa Surfers don't appear too keen on helping him better
    himself.</p><p>
<i>Encounters</i> ends quite unexpectedly with the skipping, skuzzed-up marimba
    jaunt ""Gamelan,"" which recalls the ingenious playfulness Klein Records' star
    artist, Seelenluft. It's almost as though Seelenluft is an uncredited guest here.
    ""Gamelan"" makes the inescapable point that Sofa Surfers don't really need guests
    and collaborators to make unique and engaging music. In fact, <i>Encounters</i>
    proves that, more often than not, the guests prevent the band from stretching
    themselves, and hinder them from matching or exceeding their remarkable <i>Cargo</i>
    and <i>Constructions</i>.  Go it alone next time, boys.</p></div>"|7310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7310-encounters/|6.7|Paul Cooper

I don't have much problem
    with the sounds-- some tambourine here, sitar or some such Eastern droner there--
    but the general feeling is what's hard to translate.  Descriptors like ""trance""
    or ""drone"" don't really do Vibracathedral Orchestra justice, not only because
    they carry too much baggage to really be useful, but also because they're too
    simple.  I cannot go into trance from most of this music; it's far too boisterous.
    I hear drones in the mix, but also about a hundred other things.</p><p>
    Furthermore, there's the issue over whether or not communal, cathartic improvisation
    is something that can ever be translated.  What may seem transcendent in the moment
    could very well be unintelligible in the next (that is, if true transcendence could
    actually be communicated).  Of course, anything recorded could probably be classified
    as music today, but there really isn't a working definition for the relationship
    between music and audience, specifically regarding the ""intent"" of the composers
    and resulting receipt of their message.</p><p>
    Leeds, England's Vibracathedral Orchestra (or VCO) may not give the message their
    audience takes from the music much thought.  Rather, as <i>Dabbling with Gravity
    and Who You Are</i> was made from several sessions of group improvisation in
    multi-instrumentalist Michael Flower's kitchen, recorded directly to two-track,
    there may not have been much time for big concepts, or even little ones.  Another
    member, Bridget Hayden, offers more insight into their intent: ""There is no chord
    formation that can be planned which creates elation or sadness, or any art which
    is profound enough to change anything fundamental about a person. There is just a
    resonance around us which musicians/artists are using or not using.""</p><p>
    So, what's left is continuous, non-resolved (or ever-resolved, depending on your
    point of view) ""trance""/""drone"" music, though those terms still seem a bit off
    the mark.  The album begins with ""Hypnotism of Yr Hips,"" and from the get-go it's
    clear that lulling you to sleep with smooth beats and ambient hissing will not be
    VCO's game.  In fact, much of their music appears to work best for jumping and
    flailing like a Cro-Magnon man celebrating the New Moon.  The repetitive rhythms
    seem influenced by Indian ragas (though maybe that's only because I can hear
    tablas, tambouras and plenty of tambourine) while a constant phased guitar pumps
    a fair amount of ""noise"" into the arrangement.  The song lasts about four minutes,
    and segues without a break into ""Let Steam Rule and Luck Lose.""  Here, the guitar
    plays recognizable strumming figures, and sometimes even lines resembling melodies.
    Up to this point, VCO has remained on the same chord throughout the record, and
    they'll continue to do so.  Occasionally, cymbals crash, while other times the
    tide ebbs into softer regions.</p><p>
    ""He Play All Day Long"" distinguishes itself from the mass of sound by toning down
    the ambience, introducing acoustic guitar warmth, accompanied by sitar-like drone.
    Again, the major chord from the beginning is held, though you'd be surprised at
    the textural variations they get from one tonality.  For me, this is a highlight,
    though I wouldn't blame you if you missed it somehow.  ""Fingernail R 'n' B""
    removes most of the clutter to reveal quite standard (to my ears) Indian mystic
    drones, like what you might hear in a Delhi mountaintop mosque at sunrise.  And
    just to show you that they have a sense of dynamics (extended as they may be),
    VCO kicks out the jams on the epic ""The Body Is the Arrow, The Arms Form the Bow.""
    Lo-fi, Eastern minimalist terror abounds, as a tambourine hacks away in the
    distance, cutting through layers of odd strings, low, oddly tuned strings,
    Byzantine and who knows what other cultures' lutes, and a whole array of exotic
    percussion.  There are flutes, too.  Oh, the flutes.</p><p>
    There aren't many bands that play this kind of music-- that is, with CDs for sale.
    The first incarnation of Amon Düül comes to mind, but VCO is louder (and
    drastically more musically competent) than they were.  Colorado's Biota shares
    similarities with VCO, but is nearer the avant-garde end of the art-trance
    spectrum.  There aren't many bad things to say about <i>Dabbling with Gravity</i>,
    other than I probably won't play it everyday.  It's not that I find it offensive,
    or even boring (which is a feat for ""trance"" music), but rather, droning just
    isn't an everyday thing for me.  If it is for you, VCO offer some interesting
    translations.</p></div>"|8465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8465-dabbling-with-gravity-and-who-you-are/|7.7|Dominique Leone

The best ones are good indicators of where a band is
    coming from and what they're trying to achieve.  Or at the very least, they sound
    good and work with the band's sound.  Unfortunately, not all bands can seem to
    find that one moniker that's perfect for them, and a lot of them end up settling
    for some word that was lying around not being used for much else.</p><p>
    
    Take Elbow, for instance.  That's a bleeding awful name for a band.  It doesn't
    even lend itself to much of a backstory.  What do you say to the interviewer when
    he asks how you chose your name?  ""Oh, well, we always wanted to name the band for
    the bony joint where the upper arm meets the forearm.""  Even the various idioms
    the word appears in-- elbow room, elbow grease-- can't help it out.</p><p>
    
    And then there's the questions it raises.  What does this band called Elbow sound
    like?  What made them call themselves Elbow?  Are they good?  They don't sound
    very cool.  Well, friends, it's my good fortune to report to you that the band's
    music is a lot better than their name.</p><p>
    
    The English quintet open their debut at a medium tempo with ""Any Day Now,"" a song
    that immediately highlights a few of their strengths, and also hints at a few of
    their weaknesses.  Drummer Jupp (who apparently has just the one name) lays down
    a slightly fractured, snare-heavy beat accompanied by a modicum of subtle
    programming and Pete Turner's dub-influenced bass.  Lead vocalist Guy Garvey
    seems to have his voice on loan from Peter Gabriel, though he keeps his delivery
    hushed and rather low-key.  The entire band harmonizes impressively with him on
    the choruses, making for a dense texture, especially when combined with Craig
    Potter's organ lines.</p><p>
    
    Garvey's Gabriel resemblance gradually melts away as the rest of the album unfolds,
    though he occasionally returns to it when he goes for the big held notes that
    punctuate the climaxes of songs like ""Can't Stop"" and the excellent closer
    ""Scattered Black and Whites.""  ""Red"" also retains some of Gabriel's influence,
    with its deceptively complex drum and percussion parts and heaving cello.
    Garvey's refrain of ""this can't go on"" is one of the album's best melodic moments.
    As the song's mix dismantles itself at the conclusion, the main elements exit
    first, leaving behind a heavily delayed and tremoloed guitar part that you hardly
    even noticed was there during the song.</p><p>
    
    Mark Potter dumps delay-drenched guitars all over a creeping programmed drumbeat
    on ""Little Beast,"" which finds Garvey sitting a little further from the front of
    the mix, instead subsumed by the atmospheric music created by his bandmates.  It
    takes a bit too long to get to the next song, though, and the track isn't really
    interesting enough to warrant all of its four minutes.  By the time ""Powder Blue""
    finally does roll around, <i>Asleep in the Back</i>'s biggest flaw starts to come
    into focus.</p><p>
    
    The song is actually pretty good taken on its own, with Garvey hitting a good
    falsetto on the refrain and the boys providing him with some fine backing vocals,
    but the entire album falls within a very narrow, and very slow tempo range.
    ""Powder Blue"" works well in that range, with its floating piano ostinatos and
    light spattering of sax, but these guys really need a fast song to insert
    somewhere in the running order for the sake of diversity.</p><p>
    
    The closest they come is ""Bitten by the Tailfly,"" another strong track.  It's not
    exactly fast, but its feel is considerably different from what surrounds it.
    Mark Potter's guitar kicks up actual dust for the first time on the album, and
    the faux-tribal beats and curiously tense verses lend the song a sort of neurotic
    pulse that draws you in.  The dynamic shifts between the verses and Potter's
    deafening guitar interjections are almost enough to keep it interesting on their
    own, but thankfully, the whole song proves engaging.</p><p>
    
    The band is always discriminating with their arrangements, occasionally utilizing
    analog synths to color in the edges of a passage, and using extra musicians to
    fill in the texture where it's obvious that the band's own instruments wouldn't
    quite be enough.  The best example of this is the woodwind quintet that shows up
    on the record's title cut.  At first, the cor anglais and clarinet enter with
    long, held notes, almost blending with the organ, but by the song's end, the whole
    quintet has joined, offering up countermelodies and some needed timbrel variety.</p><p>
    
    While the band has a very developed sense of texture and sound, though, they rather
    desperately need to work on changing things up a bit more with regard to the songs
    themselves.  As I said before, the whole album comes in at roughly the same tempo.
    And though they're able to make a seven-minute epic like ""Newborn"" interesting all
    the way through by shifting the texture almost constantly, simply shifting textures
    a lot doesn't offer the kind of variety I need to sustain me over the course an
    entire album.</p><p>
    
    Elbow have managed to craft a skilled and laudable debut. <i>Asleep in the Back</i>
    finds them starting their recording career (they've been a live unit for almost
    ten years now) at a level a lot of bands don't even reach on their third or fourth
    albums.  If they manage to harness their strengths and inject just a bit more
    variety into the mix, I have a feeling a second album from Elbow could really
    deliver.</p></div>"|2718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2718-asleep-in-the-back/|7.4|Joe Tangari

He
    echoed the most consistent criticism of the late Phil Ochs, who made his name with
    topical folk songs.  Ochs churned out political lyrics, taking ideas from the news
    and from first-hand experience with the turmoil of the 1960s: a coal miners'
    strike in Kentucky, the fight for civil rights in Mississippi, and anti-war
    rallies, some of which he helped organize.  His sharp lyrics and refusal to
    compromise combined with an easy humor and winning personality to make him one of
    the great protest singers.  But Ochs was also ambitious.  He'd watched his peers
    cross over to stardom: Peter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, and his friend from
    Greenwich Village, Dylan.  By the mid-sixties, Ochs was afraid he'd be left behind.</p><p>
    
    This new ""best of"" collection gathers twelve songs from Ochs' last four studio
    albums.  He'd switched labels, from Elektra to A&amp;M;, and began to write complicated
    pop songs that moved away from the news.  But he still didn't hit it big, and as
    he stagnated professionally, Nixon's election and the continuing Vietnam War wore
    him down.  The frustration and depression that permeate these songs make this a
    grim record of the end of his career.</p><p>
<i>The Best of Phil Ochs: 20th Century Masters</i> begins with over half of the
    songs from Ochs' 1967 masterpiece, <i>Pleasures of the Harbor</i>.  Ochs had been
    listening to the Beach Boys' <i>Pet Sounds</i> and the Beatles' <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i>,
    and was aiming for something just as big.  Ditching strict topical songs, he
    explored the state of the nation in lyrics about cocktail parties, elderly flower
    ladies, and sailors back from sea.  He left his guitar behind and brought in one
    of Liza Minnelli's arrangers, Ian Freebairn-Smith, to write orchestration.</p><p>
<i>Pleasures of the Harbor</i> actually sounds conservative for its time.  Ochs
    still wrote lyrics like a journalist: his florid descriptions still took in
    detailed scenes and translated them to song.  The music borrowed old-fashioned
    styles-- for example, the swelling strings on ""Pleasures of the Harbor,"" the
    neoclassical ""Flower Lady,"" and the ragtime piano on ""Outside of a Small Circle
    of Friends.""   But <i>Pleasures of the Harbor</i> was a masterful pop album.
    Ochs' voice is limited-- with his narrow range and slight twang, he was no Tony
    Bennett-- but it's stark against the baroque arrangements, and the sincerity
    makes songs like ""Flower Lady"" honestly beautiful.  ""Cross My Heart"" starts as a
    dainty pop song, but Ochs' words make it compelling-- the despair and hopelessness
    of the verses, and the conviction with which he turns it around in the chorus.
    ""Outside of a Small Circle of Friends,"" a satire of liberal apathy and laziness
    set to a ragtime tune, surpasses even ""Draft Dodger Rag"" as Ochs' most scathingly
    humorous song.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, ""The Crucifixion"" was inspired by the assassination of John F.
    Kennedy, and it asks what drives society to kill its best and youngest leaders.
    It's the pinnacle of Ochs' songwriting, though its music is a bit awkward: Ochs
    hired experimental musician Joseph Byrd to arrange it with disturbing strings and
    bizarre electronic sounds, with mixed results.  Many people-- eventually including
    Ochs himself-- regretted the weird mess that Byrd made of the arrangement, but
    it's strangely appropriate to the theme: when I first listened to this years ago,
    it was the scariest thing I'd ever heard.</p><p>
<i>Pleasures of the Harbor</i> proved the breadth of Ochs' talent, but it didn't
    help him commercially.  It outsold his earlier albums but only reached #168 on
    the <i>Billboard</i> charts. Unfortunately, this was Ochs' creative and commercial
    peak.  On his next three albums, he adjusted the formula by stripping down the
    instrumentation and bringing back explicit political lyrics.  He never found a
    combination that worked commercially, and his frustration with everything from
    his career to the political scene creeps into the rest of these songs.</p><p>
    
    The lyrics of ""Tape from California"" mix political statements and surreal imagery,
    and the song features a contemporary band with electric piano and drums.  Ochs
    wrote ""The War Is Over"" for a rally that he helped organize; its marching band
    backdrop is interesting, but the song isn't as strong without its context.
    ""William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed,"" on the other
    hand, hauntingly reflects Ochs' experience at the '68 Chicago convention.  It
    appeared, along with the mournful ""Rehearsals for Retirement,"" on an album whose
    cover bore a fictional tombstone: ""Phil Ochs ... Died Chicago, Illinois 1968.""</p><p>
    
    ""Chords of Fame"" and ""No More Songs"" come from Ochs' last studio record, the
    humorously titled <i>Phil Ochs' Greatest Hits</i>, produced by Van Dyke Parks.
    The songs tried a country/western sound as a last ditch plea for popularity.
    This collection ends with an upbeat live version of his signature tune, ""I Ain't
    Marchin' Anymore""-- but in reality, Ochs' career was over.  Writer's block, heavy
    drinking, and mental illness ended his songwriting and drove him to take his own
    life in 1976, at age 35.</p><p>
    
    In his biography of Ochs, Michael Schumaker recounts how he worried that his songs
    would be forgotten.  He has yet to be seriously ""rediscovered,"" and this generically
    titled collection probably won't change that (though it is a good and affordable
    starting point for new fans).  As Andy Whitaker said of him, ""His persona was the
    work of art.""  No matter how well the music stands on its own, it works better
    with an understanding of the time and of the man-- which can be said of our other
    great journalists, activists, and folk singers.  Like them, Phil Ochs gives us our

He draws the strange, intricate,
    scary pictures, and I can only imagine that he dreams of dank pits and Lovecraftian
    orcs.  His CPU is probably filling in a lot of the details, because most folks
    simply don't have the threshold for goth to withstand such hopelessly downward
    spiraling expression.  And while I have no insight into this guy's personal life,
    it's probably a safe bet to say he's a got a shelf-load of spell books and ghost
    stories with which to inspire a gross manner of midnight brainstorming sessions
    and shameful graveyard confessionals.</p><p>
    
    But then again, that's pretty unlikely.  It could just be that Mokkelbost
    (recording here as Single Unit) has a knack for nipping the sounds of the
    apocalypse in the bud.  Certainly, he knows a thing or two about the technique,
    taking fairly straight-ahead industrial algorithms (Reznor may be a reference,
    but something tells me he doesn't want to fuck you like an animal so much as
    merely puncture your eardrums) and spicing up the mix/remix with your workaday
    thrash guitar and avant-progressive dynamics.  And this is something he excels
    at.</p><p>
    
    Whether or not I follow his steps into the black forest mostly depends on my mood,
    because it doesn't appear he's likely to change his tune anytime soon.  Chiefly,
    if you want the real spooky stuff, Single Unit has you covered.  Likewise, if you
    just want a little sour to spoil your sweet life, Mokkelbost can help you out.
    Otherwise, fall in line to get pummeled (and I suggest leaving the bathroom
    lights on if dark isn't your thing).</p><p>
    
    Single Unit's debut full-length, <i>Family of Forces</i>, begins with the very
    brief (and prophetic) ""Moving Caves, Enter Abstract.""  Distant siren-y sounds
    close in like a spaceship landing, and soon enough, the aggro-guitar pounces
    down center stage, like a bull in a maternity ward.  The percussion matches the
    crunch strike-for-strike, and the only things that don't remind me of an electronic
    Zeni Geva are the tinkerbells entering at suitably inappropriate moments.</p><p>
    
    ""5th Cumming"" (hopefully accidental pun notwithstanding), is a rather nice
    blueprint for most of the rest of the album.  There's a pseudo-repeating figure
    wherein Mokkelbost's big guitar lays down the distortion and drang while drum
    machines pound out death metal beats and red alarm synths play like the 80s were
    only ever supposed to be good for Mad Max and eminent nuclear war.  Maybe paranoia
    is a good adjective for this album, because I keep having the feeling things are
    about to take a turn for the worse, as each layer of noise and programmed chaos
    gets tossed onto the heap.  At just over five minutes, this is one of the longest
    tunes on the album, and it feels like a week.</p><p>
    
    ""P, P&amp;P; Intro"" and ""Passion Pirates and Parasites"" are something of a mini-epic,
    and they do make use of dynamics and something like pacing (though it's brisk
    whenever possible).  The former begins like an anthem for desensitization, with
    persistently discordant keyboard mashing, and what sounds like a manic church
    organ.  This is juxtaposed with brief sections of calm, as if this is a tale of
    two different worlds (and much of this album could be described as cinematic,
    even if future shock and gore is the <i>theatre du jour</i>).  The latter tune
    feels very much like a hard prog tune, but played on the beloved sequencers and
    scarred Strat rather than with a bunch of ex-conservatory subversives named Jarno
    and Helmut.  Again, there's a feel here of doom and heavy combat, and the actual
    playing is never less than inhumanly precise, so if you need a breather (or even
    just a volume adjustment), please feel free.</p><p>
    
    The minority mode on <i>Family of Forces</i> is carnivalesque, and I'm of course
    not referring to happy clowns and cotton candy.  Houses of mirrors are more likely
    the domains of tunes like ""Fluktrute"" and ""Orgel Alene,"" both of which emphasize
    devilish whimsy over sheer sonic bombardment.  Some of this might conceivably be
    mistaken for a recent Danny Elfman soundtrack, if only he hung out with Darren
    Aronofsky more than Tim Burton.  Post-modern creaking door music?  I won't go
    that far.</p><p>
    
    Almost inevitably, this kind of record makes me a tad numb after a while.  Without
    creeping into Mokkelbost's psyche, I couldn't tell you if that was the plan all
    along, though with as much detail as went into the rhythm tracks alone, I doubt
    it.  The only downfall with making music for the end of civilization is that you
    run the risk of alienating your relatively civil listeners.  Don't get me wrong--
    I'm all for a good digital maelstrom.  But if I take a short intermission, please
    understand.</p></div>"|7185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7185-family-of-forces/|7.5|Dominique Leone

When musicians share ideas, not
    only do they get to take advantage of the very best that each of them has to offer,
    but the added perspective generally prevents them from falling into blind,
    self-obsessed egotism. Generally speaking, Stephin Merritt of the Magnetic Fields,
    the Gothic Archies, and the Future Bible Heroes, is one of those rare, wonderful
    musicians who's at his best when he's unapologetically being himself. But it wasn't
    until the release of the brilliantly executed <i>69 Love Songs</i>, on which
    Merritt opened himself up to the contributions of his touring band and guest
    vocalists, that his unique musical vision was fully realized.</p><p>
    
    And Merritt is, without question, a true original-- a character falling somewhere
    between Cole Porter and Droopy who's as likely to cite ABBA as a musical influence
    as he is to bring up Harry Partch. Over the course of his career, Merritt has
    proven that he's one of the most adept, versatile songwriters working today,
    capable of cranking out synth-pop gems and downcast piano ballads alike, all
    dripping with a unique kind of theatrical, semi-satirical melancholy.</p><p>
    
    While many artists struggle to create something that buries its influences under
    the guise of innovation, Merritt's strength has always rested partially in the
    limits he imposes on himself. While trying to incorporate such a wide range of
    influences could result in an utter mess, trying to incorporate these influences
    into, say, a three-minute pop song with a ukulele yields much more contained,
    interesting results.</p><p>
    
    This, the soundtrack to the independent film <i>Eban and Charley</i>, is the first
    thing to be recorded by Merritt under his birthname. And appropriately, it's in
    some ways the loosest, most unfiltered thing Merritt has ever recorded. Working
    outside of the framework of the pop song, Merritt is left to explore more exotic
    sound sources and song structures. Unfortunately, without that framework, these
    elements often fail to amount to anything significant, providing somewhat
    interesting, meandering background music, but little more.</p><p>
<i>Eban and Charley</i>'s 40-second, piano-only introductory piece, ""Mother,"" seems
    promising enough. Simple, stark, and vaguely melodic, the greatest strength of
    ""Mother"" lies in its brevity. Sadly, the same can't be said for the plodding
    ""Cricket Problem,"" a sound collage of bicycles, slurping straws, and music box
    chimes that fails both as a proper song and as an abstract piece of mechanical
    music.</p><p>
    
    Things pick up with ""Some Summer Day,"" one of the few songs on <i>Eban and Charley</i>
    to play host to Merritt's haunting baritone. Whimsical and melancholy without
    being too heavy-handed, the track is a lovely, albeit brief, glimpse of Merritt
    doing what he does best. Still, the album's finest moments don't come until
    ""Poppyland"" and ""Maria Maria Maria,"" the most fully developed songs on the record,
    and two songs that could easily hold their own against the Magnetic Fields' better
    work. The former harkens back to Merritt's older work, with a charming drum
    machine beat and bubbly synthesizers. ""Maria Maria Maria"" is simply gorgeous-- a
    dark, reverb-soaked slab of despondency with a lyrical combination of absurdism
    and sincerity that could only have come from Merritt.</p><p>
    
    But elsewhere, the musical accompaniment for <i>Eban and Charley</i> can't seem to
    figure out exactly what it wants to do with itself. Tracks like ""Titles"" consist
    of little more than arranged mechanical noises that don't benefit from the kind
    of grand conceptualism that made composers like Ligeti's mechanical music so
    fascinating.</p><p>
    
    For fans harboring high expectations for Merritt's work, <i>Eban and Charley</i>
    is more than a little bittersweet. Its high points are Merritt at his best, but
    substantial portions of it seem somewhat like aimless background music. Collaboration
    is indeed good thing, but the general unevenness of this record suggests that
    Merritt does his best work when the parameters of his music are established by
    his own mind, not an independent film.</p></div>"|5238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5238-eban-and-charley/|7.3|Matt LeMay

    In the preceding chapters, we established that ""quality"" is a very tangible
    attribute, which has been the cornerstone of social progress since man's
    inception. Unfortunately, the infinitely confounding nature of quality has made
    the process of defining it a long and fruitless one. In short: what the hell is
    quality? We know from previous excursions that a teacher grading written tests
    has to employ his conception of quality in order to differentiate between an
    extremely good essay and one that's relatively mediocre. Of course, there's
    always the collegiate preoccupation with correct spelling, correct punctuation,
    etc., but once semantic-correctness is out of the way, the only thing that
    earmarks a truly good paper is the quality of the work therein.</p><p>
    So what is this quality comprised of?  Talent?  Well, talent is occasionally a
    symptomatic characteristic, but to assume that the two go hand in hand completely
    ignores the ""DJ Zeph Principle.""  This is a hard law to explain so I'll refer you
    to a recent Socratic dialectic I had with one of my students:</p><p>
    Student: Hey, Prof! I just dropped by to tell you that that DJ Zeph shit you
    played during class wasn't too shabby. Why'd you come down so hard on the guy?
    He's not really a bad musician!</p><p>
    Pirsig: I see you didn't get the point of the lesson. How's a little private
    tutoring sound?</p><p>
<i>[Disc begins]</i></p><p>
    Pirsig: Alright, notice how this first song, ""Percussion Discussion,"" draws so
    heavily from world beat. The marimbas and tablas are reminiscent of the seductive
    rhythms of Laika's <i>Silver Apples of the Moon</i> (albeit, awkwardly handled).
    Too unwieldy for less-sensitive male hands, it seems.  The flourishes of guitar
    and live sitar are nice enough, but rather than creating a truly interesting
    dynamic, they merely pad out the track. Nothing horrible, but nothing to really
    pique your interest yet.</p><p>
    Student: But man, that's totally one of the best tracks on the album!</p><p>
    Pirsig: My point exactly. ""Percussion Discussion"" finds Zeph barely dipping his
    toe into foreign waters before rushing back to the patio to drape himself in
    urban America, circa 1982. This is old-school, pastiche hip-hop, right down to
    the James Brown samples. There's even a battle-rap anthem, boasting the unsubtle
    title ""Rubber and Glue,"" which features underground ne'er-do-well Azeem spreading
    the good word about his sneakers.  But ultimately, Zeph never enters the creative
    stratum of his influences, which sounds to be Grandmaster Flash b-sides. His
    scratching is pretty solid, but it's a technique with limited variation.</p><p>
    Student: But man, that takes talent!</p><p>
    Pirsig: Well, Eddie Van Halen is a pretty talented guitarist, but how often do
    you listen to <i>OU812</i>?</p><p>
    Student: Dude, I'm so disillusioned...</p><p>
    As you can see, the subject (one DJ Zeph) has enough talent to draw comparisons
    to his musical heroes but fails to invoke the same sense of excitement those same
    artists did twenty-years ago when their sound was considered ""ground-breaking.""
    Thusly, a talented individual doesn't necessitate a quality product. Obviously,
    this situation could be easily remedied. Can you guess which aspect of the Pirsig
    Equation for Artistry\xAE Zeph is lacking?</p><p>
    Talent + Innovation  = Quality</p></div>"|2392.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2392-dj-zeph/|5.5|Kevin Adickes

    lead of such 50s and 60s trash-cinema throwaways as <i>Rock, Rock, Rock</i> and
    <i>Sex Kittens Go to College</i>. Nature takes its course, though. Starlets grow
    old, beauty fades and cuteness wilts, and, well, now Tuesday Weld is just an
    obscure bandname, albeit one with an ironic qualifying prefix-- ""(The Real"") is
    tacked onto the front end.</p><p>
    (The Real) Tuesday Weld is nothing more than London native Stephen Coates, a
    recent art school drop-out and huge Serge Gainsbourg fan.  He's also a hopeless
    nostalgic, obsessed with 1930s jazz and other ancient recordings. In a quixotic
    attempt to recapture the wafting and ephemeral quality of the prohibition-day
    records he was exposed to in his youth, Coates has tacked big band samples onto
    electronic beats and backgrounds, laying down breathy vocals and glib lyrics over
    the hybrid.  And in the end, <i>Where Psyche Meets Cupid</i> is a 15-track concept
    album of stuff that, surprisingly, doesn't suck.</p><p>
    The opener ""Am I in Love"" asks the question, ""Am I in love with my love, or
    myself?"" over a musical amalgam-- both eerie and cheesy-- of a crackly, submerged
    big-band horn samples and 70s electric piano tinkling. The result simultaneously
    reminds me of Foghorn Leghorn, the ballroom scene from <i>The Shining</i>, and
    the Andrew Sisters' ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy from Company B.""</p><p>
    ""I Love the Train"" takes the same basic musical material, but brings a canned
    dance beat to the fore, resulting in something acutely contrived, yet catchy
    and effective.  Elsewhere, ""At the House of the Clerkenwell Kid"" is an instrumental
    track that I wouldn't have known was a studio pastiche if it wasn't on this
    record, and the charmingly titled ""Terminally Ambivalent Over You"" combines an
    ascending ukulele chord progression with a sexed-out Rhodes keyboard.  Annoying
    faux-scratch turntable sounds mar the composition ever so slightly.</p><p>
    ""The Birds and the Bees"" is one of the album's better tracks, coming off like a
    Brazilian rendition, at half speed, of some John Barry score that never found its
    way into a Bond film. ""Déjà Vu,"" playing on the haven't-we-heard-this-before theme
    that is the bedrock of Coates' playful genre-bastardizing, is short and sweet and,
    like the sensation itself, quickly forgotten.</p><p>
<i>Where Psyche Meets Cupid</i> is best listened to in its entirety. Taken
    individually, the tracks are as likely to make you raise your eyebrows in disdain
    as they are to pique your interest. It's as a whole that the album is actually
    somewhat affecting. The sequencing is superb, and there's a weird elegance and
    smoothness to the compositions that almost neutralizes the inherent silliness of
    combining Gatsby-era record loops with 21st century keyboard beats. Oh, and I
    promise I will never mention Foghorn Leghorn in a record review ever again. Ever.</p></div>"|6702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6702-where-psyche-meets-cupid/|7.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

Her astonishing
    and immediately moving vocals made human the endearingly plodding anachronisms of
    Air's <i>Moon Safari</i>. Had she released an album of songs as lush as ""All I
    Need"" and ""You Make It Easy,"" Hirsch would have been bigger than Dido.  Three
    years later, <i>Titles and Idols</i> trots along and I'm a little upset. Not
    as upset as I was when I heard Hirsch's rummage-sale cash-in of a debut, 2000's
    <i>Early Days</i>, but upset nonetheless.</p><p>
    
    Hirsch and her collaborators have clearly worked hard on <i>Titles and Idols</i>.
    Not a note out of place, not a beat out of sync, not a lament out of earnestness,
    this is an electronically upgraded, preciously beautiful coffee-shop poetess album.
    Its honesty and integrity are too long-faced for me. Paying close attention to
    the guileless <i>Titles and Idols</i> makes me fantasize about Hirsch performing
    the vocals to Air's blowjob panegyric ""Wonder Milky Bitch."" Perhaps I'm asking
    her to be a little super-freaky and it's her right to say no. But fifty minutes
    of humorless observations about relationships out of whack and ill-starr'd
    attempts at happiness get me hungry for some shameless grot.</p><p>
    
    Diving straight into territory identical to Everything but the Girl's
    <i>Temperamental</i>, Hirsch swoons and graciously moans through the beatless
    mix of ""Let It Live."" Thick synth pads and a wisp of a pedal steel guitar
    accentuate Hirsch's gorgeous voice. ""I Know Why"" is the first of four songs on
    this album featuring Black Dog (aka Ken Downie) as producer.  And surprisingly,
    Downie doesn't smother Hirsch in techno, instead sending rhythms skittering
    across Hirsch's facsimile <i>Clouds</i>-period Joni Mitchell-isms. Avoiding the
    thumping assault weapon production of Kosheen's ""Hide U,"" Downie finds a balance
    between his technology and Hirsch's voice.</p><p>
    
    On the title track production, Custom Blue doesn't match Downie's delicacy.
    Nonetheless, the big drums and furrowing bass compliment Hirsch's defiant
    delivery. The partially spoken word ""Captain Daylight"" is as coffeeshop as
    <i>Titles and Idols</i> gets, with a distant squeeze box lending a sea shanty
    vibe to the already briny waltz. ""Nest Sensation"" is unmistakably a Black Dog
    Production-- it bounces like an early Warp bleep release but remains sympathetic
    to Hirsch's alternately delicate and feisty statements of identity.  Still, I
    can't escape imagining that Hirsch is hinting at a desire to be Alanis Morissette
    here.  Ken Downie keeps Hirsch within the bounds of decency by directing her back
    to the Joni Mitchell School of Skipping Annunciation for the happy-go-lucky
    ""Until I Met You."" Producer Jackson from Paris steps up for one cut, the
    ukulele-glitched story song ""Nigel and Fiona,"" but like Custom Blue and Black Dog,
    he doesn't allow the production to overwhelm the singer.</p><p>
<i>Titles and Idols</i> finishes with the album's most glaring error, Custom
    Blue's ""Radical mix"" of the opener, ""Let It Live."" I think Custom Blue wanted to
    turn Hirsch into a diva ready to take on vocal duties for a mosh-pit-ready
    successor to Massive Attack's <i>Mezzanine</i>. Having signaled a blast-to-come
    with distorted, broken guitar chords, the producer doesn't have the courage
    of his convictions to force the mix into an out-and-out rocker until halfway
    through. At that point, Hirsch can't compete and is left to ululate and to
    vocalize as the riffs swirl about her like a dervish biker-gang.</p><p>
    
    Though lyrically ponderous and humorless, <i>Titles and Idols</i> is far from
    being an unpleasant listen. I have no doubts about the effectiveness and the
    beauty of Hirsch's voice nor her producers' sensitivity to her material. But
    what gets to me is that Hirsch and her producers don't really let rip. With
    exception of the failed last track, <i>Titles and Idols</i>, is awfully polite.
    Breakbeaters Lamb walk in similar territory and avoid sounding prim.  Of course,
    this record errs on the side of caution, and that should serve the album very well
    commercially.  Still, from an artistic standpoint, I can't really consider it
    an object of veneration.</p></div>"|3878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3878-titles-and-idols/|6.2|Paul Cooper

The people who toil away the hours by
    setting up mics in the hallway, bouncing track after track of sound on their
    four-tracks, ensuring that independent music can never die.  On one hand, it's
    very easy to romanticize this kind of thing: musicians who do their work with no
    guarantee of ever being heard are sort of like monks, practicing their arts far
    away from civilization, completely at odds with what the material world would
    have them accomplish.  How noble, to stick so closely to their ideals, that they
    would work so hard for no apparent reward other than hearing the sounds in their
    heads played back.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, theoretically, anyone can do this.  Go pick up a recorder, and
    sing and play and bounce to your heart's content.  As Milhouse said, ""Fun is fun,""
    but some of us have to listen to the stuff, too.  It would be nice if everyone
    who was taping themselves made good music, but often (and I can personally attest
    to this), the music is like an inside joke only understood by the teller, and
    perhaps a few of his best friends.</p><p>
    
    Of course, sometimes people are forced into this method due to circumstances.  In
    other words, if you don't have the cash or label support to record in a big, fancy
    studio, how else to make music but by recording at your house or garage?  In a
    perfect world, the Music God would automatically give the most visionary musicians
    record contracts, but as it is, the kids will have to make do with what they have.
    I imagine Canada's Greg Watson is one of these types, masterfully producing his
    own stuff because nobody else will.</p><p>
    
    Watson's virtual one-man show, the Orange Alabaster Mushroom, plays amazingly
    well-crafted psychedelic pop, generally from the British angle.  He started
    recording in 1991 under this moniker after working with a band called the 14th
    Wray.  His first music was actually issued under their name, despite being almost
    entirely written and recorded by Watson.  He did eventually end up recording in a
    proper studio in the late 90s, though the results retained his DIY aesthetic and
    only emphasized how spot-on his psych arrangements were.</p><p>
    
    As for the music, I'd say the Dukes of Stratosphear have nothing on this guy.  I
    don't generally go out of my way to listen to anything that resembles a genre
    exercise, but the Orange Alabaster Mushroom is so amazingly precise in its
    depiction of '66-'67 era British psychedelia I'm drawn into the stuff by its
    sheer persistence.  And to top it off, these are very good tunes-- what's the
    value in copying anything verbatim?  Watson's music would sit well on a shelf
    next to <i>Nuggets</i>, and that's the best compliment I can give this release.</p><p>
<i>Space &amp; Time: A Compendium of the Orange Alabaster Mushroom</i> is a compilation
    of material released from 1991 through 1998.  Watson recorded most of it on
    four-track, but a few tracks, as mentioned earlier were done on eight-track in a
    studio.  ""Your Face Is in My Mind"" is actually one of the few American-flavored
    tracks, recalling bands like the Seeds or ? and the Mysterions with raging
    Farfisa organ and raucous garage-grunge guitar.  The opening organ exposition,
    which actually reminds me of Iron Butterfly more than anyone else, is alone worth
    the price of admission.  And check this: ""Your face has left impressions/ Deep
    inside my cranium/ And when those thoughts are realized/ It's here I find/ That
    your face is in my mind.""  That's a lyric, my friend, which Watson delivers with
    whiny, crass sincerity.</p><p>
    
    No great psychedelic band could exist without its own title song.  Watson's
    ""We Are the Orange Alabaster Mushroom"" fits the bill here, and is prime Small
    Faces, circa <i>Ogden's Nut Gone Flake</i>, with its anthemic chorus and
    aggressive drumming.  ""Sunny Day"" is a tart slice of music-hall, while ""Tree
    Pie"" gets by on sheer aggression and hyped up soul power, courtesy of harmony
    vocals in overdrive and a guitar solo so of a different era that I wonder if the
    Seeds' Jan Savage wasn't beamed in for the occasion.  (By the way, Jan, where are
    you?)</p><p>
    
    Other tunes take the softer approach: ""Another Place"" features a rather beautiful
    guitar line, and telling lines like, ""I don't belong here, though there is another
    place I can go.""  Watson's vocals are still in trebly, whiny mode, yet he manages
    to bring out some inherent sweetness in this music.  Another charmer is ""Valerie
    Vanillaroma,"" featuring nice Byrds-y twelve-string guitar and relatively smooth
    harmony vocals.  The bridge's guitar and organ hits are classic, and if there's a
    fourth ""Austin Powers"" movie (as if I had a doubt), they need to get Watson to
    write the love theme.</p><p>
    
    If psychedelic isn't your thing, then obviously this album isn't for you.
    Furthermore, if hearing vinyl ticks on a CD (this collection is a re-release of
    a vinyl set from 1999, and they apparently just took the old records and
    transferred them to compact disc), then you might get annoyed with this.
    However, you can only dog on addictively catchy, well made psych-pop for so
    long before giving in to the groovy sounds.  No, this record isn't a major
    statement, but it is almost flawlessly executed.  Chalk one up to the bedroom
    musician for keeping this music alive.</p></div>"|6016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6016-space-and-time-a-compendium-of/|8.0|Dominique Leone

Are they good
    at parties?  Sure.  Are they entertaining?  On occasion.  Do you listen to them
    over and over until you have every synth splash and subtle nuance memorized?
    Ahh, there's the problem.  Whether they're comprised of funk, Moroccan trance,
    Ibiza disco, or some insidious blend of the three, they're usually going to find
    their way into the ""sell"" pile eventually.  Here's why:</p><p>
    1. The At-Home-Listening Problem: I admire a good DJ's ability to get me shakin'
    that ass on the dancefloor, but oftentimes, that doesn't make for an engaging
    experience when I'm commutin' that ass from DC to Baltimore in the morning.  Rare
    is the mix, I've found, that can hold up without the usual fog machine and strobe
    light accompaniment.</p><p>
    2. The Novelty Wear-Off: The first time through, most DJ mixes usually turn up a
    bunch of surprises, along the lines of, ""Dude, I can't believe he just segued Saul
    Williams into Sonic Youth!""  But too often, when the shock of an inventive pairing
    fades, so too does the charm.</p><p>
    3. The Wank Factor: Defined as the prioritization of technique over content; a
    DJ making ""wikkity wikkity wik"" noises for an hour is about as entertaining as a
    guitarist going ""deedily deedily deedily"" for an hour.  We're all impressed by
    their amazing dexterity, sure, but isn't there anything else these guys can do?</p><p>
    That being said, last year I discovered a mix that successfully avoided all three
    of the above pitfalls: the much-admired, widely-bootlegged <i>Brainfreeze</i>.  A
    collaboration between icon DJ Shadow and Jurassic 5 turntablist Cut Chemist,
    <i>Brainfreeze</i> was a one-hour throwdown comprised largely of rare funk and
    soul 45s.  Based around neglected classics like ""The Funky DJ,"" ""The Tramp from
    Funky Broadway,"" and most famously, 7-11's ""Doin' the Slurp"" jingle, the two kept
    the overt DJ trickery to a minimum and sculpted a mixtape symphony that withstood
    repeated listens.</p><p>
<i>Product Placement</i>, the duo's latest collaboration, is being hyped as the
    sequel to <i>Brainfreeze</i>, with a similar mission (all rare 45s), format (two
    tracks, one hour) and release (extremely limited).  Unfortunately, this sequel
    status will invariably lead to lazy critics comparing the new release to its cult
    classic predecessor.  Lazy critics like me: it's not as good, and doesn't skirt
    the above pet peeves quite as nimbly.</p><p>
    The album's first track gets off to a slow and clichéd start with the standard
    self-referential samples and exhibitions of scratching speed.  Oddly, the first
    recognizable song used is Led Zeppelin's ""Whole Lotta Love,"" which would seem to
    indicate a different musical direction for the ensuing hour (is there any man
    less funky than Jimmy Page?).  But quickly the piece settles down into a more
    soulful, chill pace, constructed from a rapid-fire series of laid-back instrumental
    segments.  So the seamless blending demonstrated on <i>Brainfreeze</i> remains
    intact, but with source material that comes across as considerably less energetic
    and gritty.</p><p>
    Complaint #2 is dangerously courted by the first track's centerpiece, ""Cookin'
    with Gas,"" a natural gas promotional tune featuring teenagers giving the most
    awful rapping performances imaginable.  While the humor of the song and the DJs'
    juvenile interweaving of, yes, fart noises rapidly wears off, Shadow and Cut
    Chemist place it over a sparse, old-school beat that provides a solid foundation
    for the middle ten minutes of the piece.  Soon enough, though, the mix returns
    to a slow, funky strut that, while enjoyable, doesn't provide much in the way of
    memorable moments.</p><p>
    Lest you think I'm unfairly comparing <i>Product Placement</i> to its predecessor,
    the second half of the disc begins with five minutes of re-worked <i>Brainfreeze</i>
    staples like ""California Soul"" and ""I'd Be Nowhere Today.""  Using different
    versions or segments of their previous record's 45s, these tracks no doubt brought
    huge cheers when the set was played on their late 2001 mini-tour.  Unfortunately,
    it comes across here as sour and cloying.</p><p>
    The following sections utilize a variety of commercial jingles (hence the title)
    and novelty tunes espousing the virtues of soft drinks, milk, Motocross, and more.
    Obviously attempts to recreate the popular ""Doin' the Slurp"" sequence from
    <i>Brainfreeze</i>, the results vary from successful (a folk-and-brass solder
    job on ""The Real Thing"") to near unlistenable (revving motorcycle noises are,
    unsurprisingly, sort of hard on the ear in any context).</p><p>
    By re-mining the same territory of their previous mutual effort with less
    compelling material, <i>Product Placement</i> falls into a trap familiar to
    sequels of another genre: film.  It would be overly harsh to say DJ Shadow and
    Cut Chemist have produced their <i>Staying Alive</i> here, but in the end, the
    album is no more satisfying a follow-up than, say, <i>Jaws 2</i>.  It's a damn
    shame: had it been an <i>Empire Strikes Back</i>, this reviewer might have been
    that much closer to seeing the DJ light.</p></div>"|2372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2372-product-placement/|6.0|Rob Mitchum

The label's
    third release was last year's underlooked <i>Oceanless</i> by Landing, a swirling
    maelstrom of harsh feedback and delicate guitar melody that was a worthy addition
    to the drone-rock canon. Now, Strange Attractors has followed the Landing release
    with this equally fine debut record by Surface of Eceon, a unit composed of three
    members from Landing and guitarist/vocalist Adam Forkner of Yume Bitsu.</p><p>
    As one would expect from a band made up of \xBE of an existing group, Surface of
    Eceon shares many qualities with Landing. Though vocals play a slightly larger
    role here (two songs have complete verses, if no choruses), the longish pieces
    are still mainly epic guitar instrumentals laced with impressionistic percussion,
    analog synth drones, and every conceivable kind of effects unit. And though this
    album is stuffed with psychedelic-dreamdrone ear candy, the sound coating would
    mean little if the band were not so accomplished melodically.</p><p>
    ""The Open Sea"" opens the album and immediately reveals a kinship to Landing and
    Yume Bitsu. A chiming guitar sketches out the chords as the song gains momentum.
    An almost unnervingly clear voice sings a spare melody, revealing Surface of
    Eceon's song-oriented bent, but the voice disappears as the guitars fall in and
    the chord changes become movements between massive walls of sound. Classic
    shoegazers like Lush are an obvious reference point, but the structure of the
    melody and the quality of the voice remind me of Low (with an explosive psychedelic
    backdrop).</p><p>
    ""Silence Beheads Us"" is a beautifully paced track of fertile, dripping wet drone.
    Tentative feedback gurgles set a placid mood that never leaves, though frayed
    seams of distortion weave in and out as the track progresses. Fans of Windy and
    Carl looking for something looser with a slightly more prickly edge take note.
    ""The Grasshopper King"" is the rockingist track, with a bouncy rhythm and <i>The
    King Beneath the Mountain</i>'s lone riff, a happy guitar pattern overflowing
    with feedback and joy.</p><p>
    The jam-out nature of ""The Grasshopper King"" is true to the Surface of Eceon
    aesthetic, as most of these tracks were birthed from lengthy improvisations.
    Unfortunately, the jam aesthetic betrays Surface of Eceon on one occasion, the
    sloppy and poorly recorded ""Council of the Locusts."" Though this track boasts an
    impressive cache of dark energy, the guitars meander aimlessly and never congeal.
    The band does redeem themselves, however, on the 16-minute closer ""Ascension to
    the Second Tier of the Outer Plane of Dryystn (Ecyeon)"" (uh, so yeah, there may
    have been some drugs taken somewhere along the way here), much of which is
    gorgeous ambient guitar work in the Fripp/Eno vein.  Altogether, <i>The King
    Beneath the Mountain</i> is a riveting collection of textured guitar noise.</p></div>"|7635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7635-the-king-beneath-the-mountain/|7.8|Mark Richard-San

They can express almost anything, but
    they can also give a crutch to someone who has nothing to talk about.  Lately,
    we've also gotten ""film music"": instrumentals that bands write for a movie (often
    an obscure one), or that were written in a form that sounds like a narrative.  In
    other words, it's music that was made for a film that you will never see.  Records
    like this-- all ten of John Zorn's <i>Filmworks</i> discs come to mind-- have
    built-in crutches, because the listener already knows something will be missing.
    We have to trust the band that the sex scene, gun fight or television commercial
    looks as cool as the theme music.</p><p>
    The British four-piece Electrelane play almost nothing but instrumentals on their
    debut, <i>Rock It to the Moon</i>.  The album sounds cinematic, and yet it's
    definitely more than just background music.  Take the second track, ""Long Dark,""
    which opens slowly with a throbbing bass and the sound of Mia Clarke scraping her
    guitar strings.  The tension builds as Clarke kicks off a ""Peter Gunn"" guitar line
    and Verity Susman pulls up with her stabbing, needle-toned Farfisa.  They tear it
    up for a couple of minutes, switch to a slow part, and then rip it up again.  Ten
    minutes, three segues, all rock.</p><p>
    There's only one problem: all of the songs sound like that.  The tunes shift
    exclusively between ""fast"" and ""slow,"" and they have so many transitions that
    playing the whole record is like watching eleven car chases in a row.  Even if
    there's a narrative, the song titles don't help us find it: one song, for example,
    is simply called ""Film Music.""  The two songs with lyrics are concise, and Rachel
    Dalley's whale song-like bass both relaxes as well as compels.  But the album runs
    for over an hour, and much of the wind is sucked out by the time they hit ""Mother,""
    the most knuckle-splitting piece on the album.</p><p>
    In small doses, however, it's terrific.  There's no doubt Electrelane could beat
    up everybody in Godspeed You Black Emperor!.  Mike Patton's Fantômas may get in
    and out quickly, and Tortoise may have nice textures, but they can't match
    Electrelane for volume: without solos, hooks, or blatant virtuosity, they kick
    out music that flares overhead like rockets and flaming school buses.  And that
    may be why <i>Rock It to the Moon</i> seems deficient-- it doesn't take an hour
    for them to make their point.</p><p>
    The first time I heard them, I wondered if Electrelane play movies when they're on
    stage.  As it turns out, last summer they arranged their set around films by
    Jean-Luc Godard.  Maybe if they can get Godard to contribute lyrics next time out
    they'll have a bigger winner.</p></div>"|2722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2722-rock-it-to-the-moon/|6.4|Chris Dahlen

    of songs but of machines: twittering little trinkets and gewgaws, clockwork
    formalist tricks, hooks, and grooves, tiny snazzy robots covered with push-buttons
    and blinking lights. I was mostly wrong about this. But back when I didn't know
    that, I was all set to talk about Cornelius's Other Half-- Takako Minekawa-- and,
    more importantly, her collaborators in Dymaxion, who are, by my estimation, past
    masters of the sonic trinketry, the clever formalist motorik grooves, and the
    whole concept of ""songs"" as basically Rube Goldberg devices-- these things where
    you watch Tab A snap ingeniously and unexpectedly into Slot B, and then watch the
    whole machine teeter back and forth. The trick is that while everyone was trying
    to meld rock genres and dance genres by throwing blippy textures and drum loops
    under crunchy guitars, some people decided to use the tools of rock but organize
    them using the structures of dance or IDM.</p><p>
<i>Point</i> isn't really as like that as I thought, but let's pretend-- just for
    a second-- that it is: you couldn't possibly ask for anyone to do that stuff
    better than Cornelius does. Like him or not, he's pretty much the master of this
    sort of thing-- evidence is littered from his late-period albums with Flipper's
    Guitar to solo records like <i>96/69</i> to tracks like ""Mic Check"" and ""Magoo
    Opening"" from <i>Fantasma</i>, his more ""proper song""-oriented U.S. breakthrough.
    Evidence is abundant on <i>Point</i>, as well: one need look no further than the
    moment where ""Bird Watching at Inner Forest,"" a sweet, jaunty samba, suddenly and
    masterfully disintegrates into ""I Hate Hate,"" a whirlwind of sliced-and-diced
    cartoon prog that sounds like Aphex Twin making mincemeat of a track by the
    Fucking Champs.  If you're going to talk about someone who can produce-- someone
    who can slap together shimmery organic instruments with the same agility as the
    world's best glitchmeisters and laptop guys-- Cornelius really should be mentioned.</p><p>
    And he's gotten a lot better at this than he was on <i>Fantasma</i>, a record that,
    in retrospect, sounds a little too eager to please-- all the tinny, busy layering
    and the near-constant bells and whistles now look a little like a hyperactive
    fourth-grader given free reign at the school talent show. <i>Point</i> backs off.
    It's more efficient, and thus more minimal: Cornelius has learned where a couple
    instruments and a couple tricks can do the work of ten of each. It's also a lot
    smoother and more languid-- the bulk of it actually qualifies to be called
    ""subdued.""  The cleverness, technical mastery and ping-pong stereo effects are
    all there in spades, but this time they're all much more mellow than you'd think.
    Listen right and you'll hardly notice them, because you'll be wrapped up by the
    thing I initially completely missed-- some of these tracks are just plain lovely
    as songs.</p><p>
    That's right: you could very satisfyingly listen to <i>Point</i> while casting
    Cornelius as some kind of modern-day Esquivel, a master of arrangement and studio
    technologically and virtually everything that makes you cup your hands over your
    headphones and be just plain wowed by the stuff that's coming out of them. But
    the thing is that <i>Point</i>, like the IDM records it shares some of its
    formalist leanings with, gradually reveals itself to contain some song forms that
    are, without qualification, quite beautiful and expressive, and in completely
    non-trinkety ways. It sounds as if he's been listening to more bossa nova-- subtle
    acoustic guitar rhythms are all over this record. It sounds as if he's made a
    conscious effort to turn his vocal harmonies from chirpy amazements to swooning,
    dreamy soft-touches.  It sounds as if he's basically loosened up, and figured out
    where subtly funky flows and immersive, bubbly drifts are way more agreeable than
    hyperactive flashes and non-stop banging. He has, in many senses, mellowed out.</p><p>
    And there's what's good about <i>Point</i>. Cornelius comes across as some sort
    of über-hipster from the glossy fashion mags, a cultural curator, a buzzy Japanese
    pastiche guy making music that feels like Bandai pocket games-- I've no doubt that
    a lot of you will hear <i>Point</i> somewhere and be turned off by precisely this
    quality, and I'll admit that before throwing <i>Point</i> on I sort of feared that
    it might be just another totally mid-90s reiteration of that heavily explored
    model. But <i>Point</i> isn't all about playing with trinkets and baubles. ""Point
    of View Point"" develops from an airy bounce into some delicious, dynamic, sweeping
    chord changes. ""Drop"" teases you by offering and then withholding a beautiful
    groove that sounds like Antonio Carlos Jobim taking a stab at writing funk, and
    then ""Another View Point"" finishes the job. ""Tone Twilight Zone"" is the equivalent
    of a Boards of Canada pastoral played live. ""Brazil"" applies singing-Macintosh
    software to a gorgeous laid-back ode with an oddly country-and-western chorus
    breakdown, and ""Fly"" is a flat-out prog single, in the best possible way.</p><p>
    Cornelius has done well, and he's done it subtly and unassumingly. If you've spent
    the last six months feeling inclined to listen solely to alt-country records, this
    may be Officially Not Your Bag.  But it's a handsome little bag, and undoubtedly,
    some people will take great, great pride in wearing it out.</p></div>"|1607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1607-point/|7.8|Nitsuh Abebe

    <i>Master Sessions Vol. 2</i> is a landmark collaboration, ignoring cultural
    boundaries to bring together two divergent musical styles to create something new.
    They'd like you to believe it, and frankly, I wish I could.</p><p>
    Here's how ""Clandestine"" Ein and Rupert Mould (aka Up, Bustle and Out) create
    their music.  First, they sculpt beats and soundscapes out of old vinyl, then
    they wrangle up musicians and ask them to play over what they've created. Finally,
    they paste everything together, adding reverb and effects, shifting pitches, and
    employing other such newfangled nonsense where needed. For the two-part <i>Master
    Sessions</i> series, the duo has traveled to Cuba in search of sounds and musicians.
    They've even brought Portishead bassist Jim Barr along for the ride, though they
    spend most of this album working with master flautist, longtime bandleader and
    Buena Vista Social Club guy Richard Egües (and his orchestra).</p><p>
    It's an interesting idea, certainly, and the divergent nature of the project's
    participants has resulted in some interesting parallels. The results are presented
    not as a collection of Up, Bustle and Out songs, but instead as a sort of audio
    documentary of the project. The disc itself is something of a mixed bag, its
    tracks ranging from dub to downtempo trip-hop to traditional Cuban jazz to
    beat-driven hip-hop instrumentals. Taken as a standard album, this utter disregard
    for thematic unity can be irritating. But taken as a part of a whole package--
    it also includes a CD-ROM full of Super 8 films of the sessions and a written
    account of the duo's time with our neighbors to the South-- the disc begins to
    make quite a bit of sense.</p><p>
    The first two tracks are pretty standard Ninja-Tune fare, the sort of thing those
    who've only heard Up, Bustle and Out on compilations are probably expecting.
    ""Coffee Contamination"" is a darkly brooding downtempo/dub track with soulful
    saxophone, a steady-toned cowbell, handclaps, and heavy, echoing standup bass.
    All of this builds to an upbeat drum-machine loop that breaks away to a sampled
    Cuban vocal which carries over into a repetition of the initial theme.  But if
    this song is the plane ride to Cuba, the next is the arrival. ""Mariel Port,
    Spanish Harlem"" begins as a solid funk original until it reaches its bridge and
    hand-percussion and subtle-at-first effects transform it into a dub-fried
    blaxploitation theme.</p><p>
    From there, <i>Master Sessions Vol. 2</i> takes a different turn. ""Descarga
    Caramelo"" is the first of a number of traditional Cuban jazz tracks featuring
    Egües and his orchestra. The transition is somewhat jarring, not unlike, say, the
    culture shock that must come when two Americans set foot in Cuba.</p><p>
    The Cuban jazz, in many ways, isn't too far removed from its origins.  A simple
    piano part gets repeated as claves get claved and cowbells get cowbelled. A few
    times, we hear the words, ""Yo quiero caramelo,"" and then come the solos; first, a
    saxophonist, and then Egües and his magic flute, then hand drums, then piano.
    Next, Egües trades eighths with the saxophonist-- a riff stolen from Richie
    Valens' ""La Bamba"" is the only way to date the piece-- before we return to the
    candy-coveting refrain. There's a laid-back element to most of these recordings,
    as evidenced by the background chatter which seems almost purposely enhanced on
    tracks like the organ-and-flute duet ""Organo de Bayamo."" The music is simple, yet
    effective, both in form and content, a throwback to the past.</p><p>
    This old-fashioned sensibility shows up repeatedly on tracks not unlike this one,
    but it's most evident on the album closer, a collage of DAT recordings made by the
    duo entitled ""Made in Cuba, Pt. 2."" On one, we can just barely hear a conversation
    over the roaring of a nearby motor. In another, we hear a man passionately cry out
    a melody as he keeps a beat with assorted hand percussion. In a third, a woman
    sings, an acoustic guitar is strummed, and a crowd mumbles in the distance. That's
    it.  Simple as can be.</p><p>
    It's all fine music. Don't get me wrong. I think I can honestly say that I enjoy
    every track on <i>Master Sessions 2</i>. Still, it leaves a key question unanswered:
    what happens when Ein and Mould collaborate with Egües and his orchestra? Sadly,
    we never really find out. Tracks like ""Jazz Sepulchre"" sees the duo sampling the
    orchestra, yes, but they never manage to truly capture the flavor of what these
    musicians are doing. Again, the music is still solid, but it's something of a
    disappointment to see such a cross-cultural collaboration hinted at but never
    really achieved.</p><p>
    Though at times a bit too disjointed for its own good (most notably in the
    differing recording styles-- the clean Up, Bustle and Out tracks often don't
    match with the intentionally unclean sessions), <i>Master Sessions 2</i> still
    works, if not as a document of a unique musical and cultural meeting then at
    least as a solid collection of songs. And that's a good thing no matter what
    culture you're a part of.</p></div>"|8367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8367-master-sessions-vol-2/|7.2|David M. Pecoraro

I probably don't even need to go beyond
    this.  Half of you know what I'm going to say. I feel trite just thinking about
    it. And yet, as is always the case, necessity squelches the desire for originality.
    Here goes:</p><p>
    
    This live album, while a must-have for die-hard fans of the group, will disappoint
    those who are looking for an inspiringly different interpretation of the band's
    canon.</p><p>
    
    Live albums are tricky business. One out of fifty times, a live album provides a
    stunning insight into a spontaneous, dynamic performance, or a collection of
    particularly outstanding performances spanning a given period of time. The other
    forty-nine times, a live recording is little more than a collection of a band's
    songs run through a bulldozer and stripped of a good deal of their ornamentation,
    complexity, and character. And thus, the above statement comes into play. If you
    love the songs, you'll love the slightly different versions of the songs; if you
    don't give a fuck about the songs, you're wasting your time.</p><p>
    
    In the case of Eric's Trip, the live treatment does marginally alter the nature of
    the band's music, sometimes allowing some extra vibrancy and energy to come through,
    but almost always removing a good deal of the charm that makes their albums so
    appealing. Eric's Trip slapped together beauty and noise in a fantastically
    haphazard manner, jumping with reckless abandon from lazily strummed acoustic
    guitars to hectic, screeching feedback. On <i>The Eric's Trip Show</i>, the
    contrast between the various sounds employed by the band is greatly downplayed,
    replaced by a steady stream of consistently rocking numbers.</p><p>
    
    Which is not to say that there aren't some absolutely lovely songs on <i>The Eric's
    Trip Show</i>. The album opens with ""Stove,"" a classic cut from the band's debut,
    <i>Love Tara</i>, featuring Julie Doiron's gorgeous, breathy vocals. It's all well
    and good, but it doesn't do much in comparison to the original, with its dreamy
    cymbal crashes and intensely intimate recording quality.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, the loss of intimacy is a big problem with this album, as the close-up,
    lo-fi recording that helped make Eric's Trip's proper albums so great is no longer
    a factor. The band plays their songs through, and the songs themselves are pretty
    damned good. On tracks like ""Blinded,"" Mark, Chris, Julie, and Rick really start
    to rip shit up-- a needed blast of energy, and a nice addition to <i>The Eric's
    Trip Show</i>, but certainly no replacement for the moments of sheer brilliance
    that can be found in the band's albums.</p><p>
    
    Which brings me back to the original point. The songs on <i>The Eric's Trip Show</i>
    are very good songs. I'd venture to say that some of the more straight-up rock
    numbers actually sound better here than they do on studio LPs. But generally
    speaking, this album leaves Eric's Trip without some of their greatest musical
    assets. If you're in love with the songs, this probably won't matter to you; if
    you're not, this won't help.  But you already knew that.</p></div>"|2828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2828-the-erics-trip-show/|6.4|Matt LeMay

Or rather, bands like this usually
    take a while to develop before coming around.  I imagine a half decade or so of
    learning the ropes, releasing things that go nowhere except as one-off tracks on
    mix tapes for that girl you met at that local band concert last weekend.  Usually
    the bands get some kind of grassroots following, starting in their town, and they
    luck into getting featured on a CMJ sampler, and then get name-dropped on an
    indie zine year-end poll (if only by the guy who likes a bunch of no-name hardcore
    bands).  Fairly soon afterwards, the band releases an EP on a big independent
    label, and are the talk of free publications everywhere, though still so far
    underground to the general public as to be relatively non-existent in the greater
    scheme of things.</p><p>
    
    At some point, this band will tour with a slightly bigger unknown band who has
    been receiving props from the same zines for a couple of years now, and who is
    at the point where their next record has to be a hit or they'll lose the attention
    of big labels (indie or not) and big venues.  And the little band who's still very
    much on the way up, who has worked their sound into a precise, angry young package,
    hardly sees that, unless they headline the same tour next year, they're well on
    the way to becoming yesterday's news.  But they're probably still a good band
    whose only flaw was taking a little time to develop.</p><p>
    
    But Gaji is here, and they are full-grown.  Of course, they had their small
    beginnings in Tokyo in the early 90s, but didn't release anything, save some
    singles and seven-inches, until 1999 when their first record garnered them exactly
    the same kind of underground raves in Japan I was talking about.  They played
    shows with the right people (Ruins, among others), got compared to the right
    people (Melt-Banana and Zeni Geva, to name a couple), and if they had only been
    distributed outside of their country, they'd have doubtlessly made the infamous
    indie splash in all parts.</p><p>
    
    The great thing I hear in this band is that they don't appear to be playing
    towards their peers or press.  <i>Ten to Ten Past Ten</i>, their second
    full-length, sounds like a punk band who somehow learned that just playing the
    old sound, or even updating the old sound for all-important cred points,
    wasn't really the point.  Gaji, a four-piece led by vocalist Yuko Hasegawa,
    plays music rather distinct and passionate, and I hope they have as little
    regard for the formula of making it big as I do.  This introduction isn't my
    ad for the band, but it is something of a thank-you note to people who play
    their stuff without much pretense other than jamming out seriously hard shit
    (just like the old bands used to do), yet don't sound like anyone one else.
    That's Gaji, as far as I can tell.</p><p>
    
    In Japan, they get lumped in with Melt-Banana, but they're hardly that spastic,
    instead opting for surprisingly intricate (sometimes broaching minimalist) guitar
    and basslines, albeit very aggressive ones.  ""Southwest"" leads off the album with
    Hasegawa spitting out lines like, ""String puller/ Beat ruler/ Beat ruler/ Inciter,""
    protesting who knows what injustice over angular guitar and basslines seemingly
    more suited to old school math-rock bands like Slint or Don Caballero.  Thing is,
    this isn't some abstract brainfreeze music, but as punk as anything SST put out.
    Of course, they don't really sound like Black Flag, but you probably guessed that
    by now.</p><p>
    
    ""Flower of Conspiracy"" actually starts with little more than a simple, soft guitar
    figure accompanied by clicking drumsticks.  It gives way to a bit of feedback, and
    then dives into a very straightforward, almost droning piece of music.  Drummer
    Chisaki Taguchi never plays more than is absolutely necessary to carry the band,
    and the bass and guitar worry so little about fleshing out the sound you'd think
    it was a demo-- if not for Hasegawa's priceless deadpan vocals, which are often
    similar to the Waitresses' Patty Donahue or even Exene Cervenka at her most
    passionately desensitized.  But when Hasegawa drops lyrics like ""spinning spiral
    in a silence"" and ""men betray repeatedly, lament,"" I don't doubt she has quite a
    bit of emotion invested in this.</p><p>
    
    The best moment of the album for me comes in the transition between ""Mute"" and
    the title track.  The former is a lengthy tune, with only single word exclamations
    from Hasegawa, and a rhythm section that sounds like it was recorded in my hallway,
    with all the edges smoothed out by natural reverb, and repeating guitar figure
    that would make Tortoise proud.  This builds for several minutes, and then-- *pop*--
    nothing.  The whole thing disappears, only to explode into ""Ten to Ten Past Ten.""
    Guitarist Yui Kimijimi has his Robert Fripp-meets-D. Boon riffs down pat, and then
    some.  This is their best tune, due not least to the extremely compact arrangement
    (again, no wasted notes, amazing riffs or circus freak intensity), and an odd
    vocal, landing on notes that somehow turn the mood from angry and resistant to
    something like mystical hardcore.  It's a very strange, inspiring song (check the
    ""chronic depressed states be over"" line for further proof).</p><p>
    
    Now for the bad news: you're probably going to have to work to get this, as it
    hasn't been released outside of Japan.  Once again, the indie cycle of failure
    threatens to strike, but if you're willing to look around, you can find it.  Gaji
    aren't going to change the world with this release, but I suppose given the right
    set of circumstances and a willing audience, they could get a chapter in the
    Arcane Annals of Punk.  Bands like this, fully formed and beyond being ready to
    fight, are rare enough that even if they aren't getting their due off the island,
    they'll probably find a way to make waves elsewhere.</p></div>"|3374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3374-ten-to-ten-past-ten/|8.5|Dominique Leone

    late afternoon sun and the sweat pouring from beneath the brim of his freshly
    purchased ten-gallon hat. At the sight of the ranch house, he sighs with relief
    and leaves his tired horse at the edge of the porch.</p><p>
    
    His spurs clank with each footfall, and he notes the damage done to his fancy new
    boots as he trudges up the stairs. At the door, he reacquaints himself with his
    reflection in the window, and knocks.</p><p>
    
    ""Come on in.""</p><p>
    
    He enters, and sees his employer, Gar Price, fumbling with a small black box.
    ""You seen these?"" asks Gar. ""CD player.""</p><p>
    
    ""You wanted to ask me something, boss?""</p><p>
    
    ""Yeah, yeah."" Gar mutters, offers a box of cigars. ""Smoke?""</p><p>
    
    ""Don't mind if I do."" Brady strikes a match against the heel of his boot.  ""You
    wanted to see me.""</p><p>
    
    ""Well, Brady, I got this new CD-- for the newfangled phonograph there. Band called
    Little Grizzly. Texas boys. Ever heard of them?""</p><p>
    
    ""I reckon I haven't,"" says Brady.</p><p>
    
    ""It's these four renegade cowboys from up round Denton. Leader's George Neal and
    he's got some real city slickin' ways about him. I think that's mighty suspicious.""</p><p>
    
    ""Yessir.""</p><p>
    
    ""I'll be damned if I know what to make of this music.  I know you're something of
    an educated man, Brady, and I was wonderin' if you could make heads or tails of
    this.""</p><p>
    
    Gar pushes a button on the black box and the room floods with music.</p><p>
    
    Five cigars and six Tequizas later, after a long period of critical evaluation
    interspersed with Gar' one-sided conversation about upkeep on the ranch,
    Brady offers, ""I gotta admit, I like that George Neal feller's vocals. He sounds
    like Wayne Coyne with a Western tinge. Hand over that case... yeah, this song's
    called 'Today Is the Day.'  I like that part at the chorus where things start to
    sound a little more like a sloppy Flaming Lips. That's a good thing, by the way.</p><p>
    
    ""And the lyrics ain't bad, really. Sorta funny and absurd and poignant at the same
    time. Like on 'Charlotte,' which seems to be about a robot, though I ain't sure.
    That song may be more your speed. Shows more of its country-roots. Just George
    Neal and an acoustic guitar.""</p><p>
    
    ""Right pretty,"" says Gar.</p><p>
    
    ""There's a coupla waltzes on this disc,"" replies Brady. ""The first, 'I Though I Knew
    Better Than That,' is louder but, if you don't mind me sayin', the undue twang
    makes it sound like novelty. The second, 'Mockingbird Glasses,' is a whole other
    story. Feels antiquated.  Even the lyrics allude to a sort of sepia-toned past of
    'Mockingbird glasses, torn waistcoat and glasses, and old movie posters.' The
    organ work is nice in this song. Adds character to the song without overwhelming
    the other instruments, and I tell you what, sir, that's becoming a rarity these
    days.  This George Neal is a heckuva multi-instrumentalist.""</p><p>
    
    ""City slicker,"" Gar responds. ""What'd I tell you?""</p><p>
    
    ""Well, boss, listen up here in 'Sleep Foreign Engine.'  It's a sad sort of
    anti-lullaby. Good song, but the real high point comes with the horn section
    about halfway through...""</p><p>
    
    ""Son, I don't know what in tarnation you're talking about.""</p><p>
    
    ""I'll sum up: Little Grizzly writes country-flavored indie pop with more of an
    edge, than say, Jay Farrar's last album. They're not afraid to turn up the amps
    and rock Uncle Tupelo-style when the time is right, but it seems somehow wrong to
    keep drawing comparisons to alt-country bands.  With few exceptions-- ""Charlotte,
    ""Mockingbird Glasses""-- their best stuff comes when they keep the country to a
    minimum. And the worst tracks on the album-- ""I Knew Better Than That,"" ""Drum
    Major""-- show the down-home flavor getting the better of George Neal. Over the
    top dialect and affectation only go so far.  Consider, for example, this review.</p><p>
    
    ""On the whole, it's a pretty good 'compact disc.' They take a fairly basic formula
    you've prob'ly heard before and make it sound reasonably fresh.  Some songs are so
    catchy, they feel almost like guilty pleasures. I say give it a try or two. It'll
    probably grow on you.""</p><p>
    
    ""Well, I thank you, Brady,"" says Gar, ""but I think it's about time we wrap
    this up.""</p><p>
    
    ""Yes, sir, I reckon so.  But how?""</p><p>
    
    Gar's head turns into that of a goat's, and his hands become like giant katana
    blades.  Brady's boss has revealed his true identity.  And now, he speaks, with
    a voice that is as thunder. ""I am the demon lord, Abadon.  Embrace Satan!""
    Quickly, he plunges his mighty katanahands into Brady, who can only utter, ""If
    you don't mind my sayin' so, I certainly did not see that comin', sir.""  Whereupon
    Abadon feasts upon the lifeless flesh of his employee until he finally bursts into
    several smaller demons and disappears through the walls.</p></div>"|4816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4816-id-be-lying-if-i-said-i-wasnt-scared/|7.2|Alison Fields

    genre to touch them.  In those moments, their sound threatens to go completely over
    the top, the massive beats and electronic squelches ripping through the speakers
    like they're about to physically jump out into your living room.  Back in '97, I
    would drive around listening to ""Block Rockin' Beats,"" unable to feel like anything
    but a bad motherfucker.  I might have only been behind the wheel of a Jetta, but
    that's not the issue.</p><p>
    
    Of course, a good way to judge a Chemical Brothers album is via the ego-inflation
    factor.  If you're feeling like Al Capone with a fat bank roll and a baseball bat,
    the Brothers are achieving the desired effect; if you feel like you're shopping
    for designer footwear, things have veered horribly off-course.  The fact is, the
    Chemical Brothers' greatest strength lies in their ability to lay down irresistibly
    fat basslines and breakbeats that would make Bootsy Collins' fingers bleed.  A
    good Chemical Brothers track should bulldoze any form of criticism simply because
    it's a strictly visceral experience-- you press play and send the frontal cortex
    to its room to play with blocks for a while.</p><p>
    
    The big question going into <i>Come with Us</i> was whether they'd come out Kung-Fu
    fighting or serve up another batch of watered-down techno beats like those dished
    out on their previous album, <i>Surrender</i>.  I wanted to see them rely less on
    guest cameos (almost invariably a bad sign)-- Bernard Sumner and Hope Sandoval
    should stay as far away from the studio as possible, preferably with a 300-pound
    bouncer with a pit bull screening the door-- and they generally do.  Sure, Beth
    Orton and Richard Ashcroft managed to get their fingers in the pie, but some of
    these tracks also return to what the Chemical Brothers do best.  In the end, it's
    a mixed bag.</p><p>
<i>Come with Us</i> flies out of the gates unexpectedly with its first three
    tracks, immediately dragging the listener through a relentless torrent of beats
    and sonic energy.  The title track, with its agitated, looped strings, undulating
    waves of syrupy keyboards, shouts, and strong backbeat, is reminiscent of the
    Beastie Boys at their most raucous; ""It Began in Afrika"" is a rapid, heart-pounding
    conga workout that distills the quick reflexes and primal urges of a cheetah hunt
    under a deadpan voice repeating, ""It Began In Afrika-ka-ka""; and ""Galazy Bounce""
    features a repeated call-and-response sample over tight, driving slap-bass funk.
    None of this is a thought-provoking music in the slightest, and I wouldn't want
    it any other way.  These tracks are purely functional-- all speed, sweat and
    clenched muscle-- and, as convenient packets of immediate party energy, they
    succeed admirably well.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it's when the Chemical Brothers deviate from their role as Big Beat
    deities that problems arise.  ""Star Guitar"" apparently substitutes for the missing
    Sumner track-- it's slight, but not nearly as vapid as ""Hoops,"" the song that
    follows it.  Honestly, none of the remaining material returns to the quality of
    the first three cuts, though ""My Elastic Eye"" and ""Denmark"" do manage to turn up
    the heat a bit.  But there's not much to be said about the Orton (""The State
    We're In"") and Ashcroft (""The Test"") numbers, other than that they're both about
    as middle-of-the-road as you might expect they'd be.  ""The Test,"" for example,
    sounds like a weak companion piece to the Simple Minds' ""(Don't You) Forget About
    Me,"" and Orton's admittedly seductive vocals aren't nearly enough to rescue an
    inherently bad song.</p><p>
    
    Yep, <i>Come with Us</i> is another let down, no two ways about it.  And all
    because Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons seem confused about where they'd like to go.
    There are certain things they do very well, yet they don't seem to be content
    with being pigeonholed as one-dimensional.  Unfortunately, one-dimensional is
    about the only thing they can pull off convincingly.</p></div>"|1417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1417-come-with-us/|6.2|Nathan Rooney

You love <em>Rushmore</em>, too.  Admit it.  I'd wager my     lunch money that 98% of regular Pitchfork readers see at least a little bit of     themselves in the blue blazer and thick glasses of Max Fisher.  We've all had     hopeless crushes on teachers, been thrown out of prep schools, and written stage     adaptations of <em>Apocalypse Now</em>.  You know, figuratively like.</p><p><em>Rushmore</em> also appealed to me (and to you) as a rare example of the effective     musical movie, where the songs and score perfectly complemented the action on     screen.  It's no small wonder, then, that the accompanying soundtrack was one of     the best in recent memory, playing like a mix-tape with selections hand picked by     Fisher himself.  British Invasion chestnuts from Creation and the Kinks reflected     the angst and paranoia of the film's teenage protagonist, while Devo founder Mark     Mothersbaugh's quirky score spoke for the slightly off-kilter charm of the film.     Unlike the thinly veiled label showcases masquerading as ""inspired by"" soundtracks     for most of today's movies, the <em>Rushmore</em> soundtrack worked as both souvenir     and autonomous album.</p><p>Which brings us to <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>, the new flick from the team that     brought you <em>Rushmore</em>, and its companion album.  Again, you get a healthy     helping of Mothersbaugh score, which largely finds him exploring much of the same     territory of <em>Rushmore</em> (i.e. the limitless potential of a jazz quartet     consisting of acoustic guitar, vibraphone, harpsichord and drums).  And again, the     score weaves in and out between a choice sampling of 60s and 70s rock, albeit this     time from slightly bigger names: Dylan, Velvets, Ramones, etc.</p>
<p>But like the disillusioned characters of its cinematic parent, <em>Tenenbaums</em>'     songs deal with the more adult issues of loneliness and dissatisfaction.  Rather     than the sexual frustration swagger of garage rock, the film's bittersweet     melancholy is represented by the plaintive acoustic singer/songwriter and the     lush, orchestrated chamber pop set piece.</p>
<p>These two threads are combined in the bookend tracks by dictionary-definition     chanteuse Nico.  I'll admit to never really appreciating her contributions on     the first Velvet Underground album; her female Bela Lugosi vocalizing always     seemed like a particularly unfunny Andy Warhol joke.  But ""These Days"" and ""The     Fairest of the Seasons,"" with their delicate finger-picking and tasteful strings,     somehow fit her valiant struggles with the English language in a more ear-pleasing     manner.</p>
<p>The threads of Nico's ruminations on loneliness (what, didn't she bang Jim     Morrison?) are picked up by the folky stylings of someone named Emitt Rhodes     and everyone's favorite mope, Elliott Smith.  Furthering the widely held theory     that first names ending in ""tt"" lead to chronic depression, both are excellent     examples of a genre I call ""shower-rod swinging"" music, or just Kozelekmer for     short.  Smith's ""Needle in the Hay,"" especially lives up to the term, given the     scene from the film in which it plays.</p>
<p>But nothing says desolation like stringed instruments playing in a minor key, and     both Nick Drake and the Yseye Quartet are happy to provide.  The latter's     performance of Ravel's ""String Quartet in F Major"" (a composition I'm sure we all     know and appreciate, cough, cough) blends particularly well with the more expansive     Mothersbaugh score contributions with its playful pizzicato and frenetic string     bass.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it's the Mothersbaugh score that steals the spotlight on the entire     album, providing a kind of modern classical music that walks the thin line between     complete avant-garde unlistenability and Yanni-ism.  The many unexpected twists     and turns of the epic 7:18 ""Lindbergh Palace Hotel Suite"" (a sudden drop into     reggae, an extended drum solo) make more sense in the film, but on disc serve as     brilliantly absurd flourishes in the midst of a twinkling orchestral piece.     ""Mothersbaugh's Canon"" and ""Sparkplug Minuet"" similarly showcase his growth as a     film composer by incorporating a children's choir and flutes.</p>
<p>Not all the song selection fits and abets the mood, however.  The Clash's ""Police     and Thieves"" and the Ramones' ""Judy Is a Punk"" are both great songs, undoubtedly,     but stick out with their increased volume and attitude.  Bob Dylan's ""Wigwam"" is     from the heretofore unknown ""moaning along with a brass section"" phase of his     career (1970, to be exact), and is rather unpleasant.  Their inclusion is     befuddling, considering the more thematically appropriate songs from the movie     left off the soundtrack: Van Morrison's harpsichord-driven ""Everyone,"" or     Mothersbaugh's merry-go-round organ version of ""Hey Jude.""</p>
<p>While <em>Rushmore</em> captured the turmoil of youth, <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em> soundtrack aims to portray more mature emotions than those of a hormone-crazed     fifteen-year-old boy, and mostly succeeds.  But then again, you're over that     crush on Miss Cross, too.</p></div>"|7872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7872-the-royal-tenenbaums-ost/|7.5|Rob Mitchum

    scientists, are perennially seeking theories to institute order upon the chaotic
    world around them.  Every musical scribe aspires to create something as elegant
    as Scott Copperwood's historic <i>The Inevitability of the Concept Album</i> or
    Patrick Reilly's famous <i>Cleavage + Low Neckline = HUGE Country Music Sales</i>
    study.  Today, as a Pitchfork <i>Exclusive!</i>, I'm going to let you in on my
    most-valued personal theoretical creation: the Bands-in-Love Axiom.</p><p>
    
    The Bands-in-Love Axiom is a concept more effectively shown than described.  The
    First Couple of Indie Rock, Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore, flaunted it with the
    heavenly harmonies of ""Cotton Crown,"" though it rarely applied after that.  Low's
    Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker show that Mormons can do it, too, but often keep it
    restrained under their slowcore blanket. Caithlin de Marrais and Kyle Fischer of
    Rainer Maria tapped into it occasionally on their first two albums, but gave it
    up to try to be a low-rent My Bloody Valentine on <i>A Better Version of Me</i>.
    Still, for a long time, ""Tinfoil,"" off of Rainer's first album served as the
    linchpin of my theory; the opening ""God-DAMMIT!!!"" the vocal harmony equivalent
    of love's beautiful train wreck.</p><p>
    
    But then last spring, I stumbled upon a tiny little band named the Mates of State
    in San Francisco.  And lo, my theory was made flesh.  The Mates stripped away all
    those superfluous band members not involved in the central relationship, leaving
    just two people thoroughly infatuated with each other.  Kori Gardner played her
    vintage Yamaha organ, Jason Hammel banged his drums, and both sang, not just
    together, but to each other, their eyes locked onstage in what my friend described
    best as ""The Love Gaze.""  Their debut album, <i>My Solo Project</i> captured this
    vibe surprisingly well, with lines like, ""I color the sky with you/ I let you
    choose the blue,"" warming the cockles of even the most steely-hearted listener.</p><p>
<i>Our Constant Concern</i>, the band's first album for Polyvinyl Records,
    promised that the duo was sticking to the same tight formula, causing me to rub
    my hands in mad scientist-like anticipation of more support for my theory.  But
    alas, it was not to be: the musical spark is gone!  And furthermore, things are
    apparently still all holding hands and eskimo kisses for Kori and Jason,
    considering the occurrence of their marriage between albums.  My theory, what's
    happened to my beautiful theory?!</p><p>
    
    It's actually really hard to put a finger on what isn't clicking this time out
    for the Mates, as one would think a two-person band couldn't adjust their sound
    too dramatically.  One possible culprit is the general slowing of the material;
    by my count a good six of ten tracks stroll along at a tempo best described as
    ""mid.""  Easing off the gas pedal isn't always a bad thing, but here it seems to
    drain a good portion of the energy the band showed previously.</p><p>
    
    Furthermore, this time around Gardner seems to be using a greater variety of the
    organ's effects, rather than focusing upon the guitarish sound of <i>My
    Solo Project</i> (I want so badly not to mention Quasi, but <sigh> think Quasi).
    The strategic change allows us to sample the keyboard's seemingly endless
    repertoire, such as the xylophone/steel drum sound and a brilliantly fake-sounding
    brass synthesizer.  But without the fuzzy crunch and Hammond-esque bass of the
    distorted setting, the new songs sound, well, a lot like it's only two people
    playing.</sigh></p><p>
    
    Most traumatic of all, however, is the Mates' movement away from the fantastic
    pseudo-harmonies of earlier work.  On songs like ""La'Hov"" and ""Throw Down"" from
    the first album, Gardner and Hammel each belted out vocal parts that wrapped
    around each other in a way far from technically perfect, and thrillingly so.
    The harmonies on <i>Our Constant Concern</i>-- tracks like ""10 Years Later"" and
    ""Girls Singing""-- are far less eccentric and less vibrant, sometimes resorting
    to mere unison singing.</p><p>
    
    The old magic pops up here and there, as in the enjoyably ridiculous <i>Graceland</i>-like
    vocal intro to ""Quit Doin' It"" and the sugar-high two minutes of ""Halves and
    Have-Nots.""  But these brief flashes, even on a thirty-minute album, do little to
    keep the dreaded sophomore slump virus from hitting <i>Our Constant Concern</i>.
    Perhaps, sadly, the Band-in-Love Axiom is only good for one great album per act.
    Until next time, though, the romanticist in me will hope otherwise.  C'mon, guys,
    do it for my theory.</p></div>"|5146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5146-our-constant-concern/|5.0|Rob Mitchum

    Boys, and because it seems like nobody can talk about Girls Against Boys without
    referencing sex, we're gonna talk about sex appeal, and how it is that Scott
    McCloud and Johnny Temple-- in both their flagship band and their side project--
    came to sound like Henry Miller's edits when discussing their music. ""Man, do you
    hear that libidinous croon? Don't you dig that sexy, swaggering, 'come-hither-and-fuck-me'
    bassline?""</p><p>
    
    I'm not entirely comfortable with talking about libidinous crooning, if only
    because I've always associated it with permed, hairy-chested geezers and some
    combination of pity and repulsion.  Which could mean that New Wet Kojak vocalist
    Scott McCloud is a shoe-in for Ladies Nite at the Starlite Lounge in twenty years
    or so.  That aside, though, McCloud's vocal stylings work well-- perhaps even
    better than in the GVSB setting-- with the jazzy, ambient, cooler-than-thou
    character of New Wet Kojak. In fact, when he talks about rock stars, big tippers,
    Sophia Loren, and living the low life on <i>No. 4</i>, it makes it easier for the
    listener to believe he knows whereof he speaks.</p><p>
    
    Of course, this is all tongue-in-cheek. Mostly. The opening track, ""Livin' 2 Low,""
    opens with a spacy ambient loop and a smooth rhythm section somewhat reminiscent
    of latter day U2. And right when you're about to start slithering about the dance
    floor, McCloud imparts these sexy thoughts: ""The world thirsts for a car/ Deodorant/
    The life as advertised.""  I've long believed Girls Against Boys smirked at press
    that perceived their sexy-with-an-edge shtick as anything more than an affectation.
    Likewise, New Wet Kojak takes the affectation so far overboard that it's hard not
    to believe McCloud and Temple aren't satirizing themselves.  ""Livin' 2 Low,"" with
    its Prince-style syntax title, seems paean to the steamy Saturday-night-out and
    winks at the audience. And to clarify: it's not a ""hey baby"" sort of wink.</p><p>
    
    ""Do the Math"" is an infectious, new wave/disco hybrid romp that, as a stand-alone
    track, nearly justifies the release of the entire single. It's fairly simple,
    forgoing the ambient gloss of the other tracks for playful bass, Charles Bennington's
    terrific saxophones (which make a serious case for the widespread reintegration of
    the sax into the indie dance-pop idiom), and sly lyrics like, ""Real chicks prefer
    rock stars/ Do the math.""  ""Sophia Loren,"" meanwhile, opens with the sound of horns
    and delicate guitar work, building into a crashing, sneering ruckus (unsurprisingly
    evocative of pre-<i>Freak*on*ica</i> Girls Against Boys) featuring a strangely
    metal-guitar flavored sax solo.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately the energy of the first three tracks falls away on ""Year of the
    Sheep.""  An unnecessarily dirge-like beat-poetry-jam rides over one of the most
    repetitive piano lines I've ever heard, making this a clear candidate for some
    throwaway compilation contribution (or, if nothing else, the garbage can).  Ditto
    the remix of ""Love Career."" The original version, one of the high points on <i>Do
    Things</i>, was hardly begging for a remix as it was.  And the <i>No. 4</i> version,
    integrating naptime strings samples and uninspired drum loops, is simply boring.</p><p>
    
    So this is a tough call rating-wise. Sixty percent of this CD is dead on-- a solid
    follow up to 2000's <i>Do Things</i>, and indicator of good things to come.  But
    the last two tracks sully the picture a bit. I'll grant that everyone, even
    libidinous crooners, have bad days, and some of those bad days are sort of
    interesting. The second half of this EP, however, is boring. And there's nothing
    less sexy than that.</p></div>"|5779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5779-no-4-ep/|6.0|Alison Fields

    moment when the psychotic killer springs out from behind some inconspicuous chunk
    of scenery and plunges his machete into the heart of his poor, unsuspecting victim.
    The truly frightening part of any scary film lies in those painstakingly drawn-out
    moments before the bloody death when the soon-to-be victim is creeping through
    some deserted mansion/wharf/warehouse as a string section pulsates toward some
    crescendo that always lingers just vaguely out of reach. This is the unsettling
    part, not because of anything that's happening onscreen, but because of what the
    audience knows must be coming. The question is never what will happen, but when.
    And the best horror films are those that toy with the audience, always keeping
    the answer to that ubiquitous question a surprise.</p><p>
    The same principals, in many ways, hold true to jazz. As magnificent as a spirited
    free-improvised burst of balls-out drum-thumping, vicious bass-plunking, blood-rushing
    horn-skronking, and furious piano-thumping may be, the true measure of a band is
    how they find their way in and out of such moments, how they build, foreshadow
    and sneak quietly away after the deed is done.</p><p>
    The Goodheart Allen Powell Trio knows enough to linger on the quiet moments. The
    first four minutes of the trio's debut recording, <i>I Can Climb a Tree, I Can Tie
    a Knot, I Can Have a Conversation</i> bears resemblance to John Cage's early
    chance orchestrations or the Art Ensemble of Chicago in their most abstract form.
    Silences abound, sounds come in spurts and often step on each other's toes. While
    there's an innate feeling that the musicians are responding to each other, at
    times it seems they're playing by a logic only they can understand.</p><p>
    By the time
    saxophonist Josh Allen pipes in with our first hints of structure-- riffing on the
    first few notes of ""Amazing Grace,"" no less-- we've already grown comfortable with
    the idea of this loose-fitting avant-jazz trio.  But when Matthew Goodheart and
    Garth Powell jump on this bandwagon (playing piano and percussion, respectively),
    sending the jam flying out of orbit and into the aforementioned wild-and-crazy
    avant-freak-out stuff, all notions of comfort are thrown out the window. This is
    when, with one well-timed cymbal-crash, the whole thing comes to a dead halt.
    Then, against a backdrop of silence, as if to comfort the unnerved listener,
    Goodheart plunks out a soothing lullaby. Before the song, entitled ""Waiting for
    Our Careers to Take Off,"" is over, this, too, will have mutated into another one
    of these freakouts.</p><p>
    Still, the noisy moments are atypical. Most of <i>I Can Climb a Tree</i> is quiet,
    subtle. Indeed, these occasional spurts of madness seem present mostly for contrast's
    sake, to grab you by the shirtsleeve before shifting back to quiet exploration.
    Any good horror film will have its fair share of suspenseful moments that build
    to a letdown. You know, those scenes where a character creeps down a dark hallway,
    his fear heightened by clichéd music, opens the door, and the audience subconsciously
    braces themselves, only to find the character's friend standing on the other side
    of the door?  These scenes serve to build suspense.  Similarly, songs like ""The
    Water is Wet,"" which register as little more than dynamic ripples after the
    drastic shifts of the two opening tracks, serve to string listeners along, which
    makes those songs which do crescendo (like the comparatively straightforward
    ""Accumulation #1"") that much more effective.</p><p>
    All this comes as a pleasant surprise to the music critic who, seeing three names
    he didn't recognize on the cover of a jazz album, immediately became skeptical.
    But not only are Goodheart, Allen and Powell all solid musicians in their own
    right, they also work together in such a way that makes it difficult to believe
    this is only their first recording together. Granted, a look at their lineage
    explains a lot. These are musicians who've worked with the likes of Eugene
    Chadbourne, Cecil Taylor and Mats Gustafsson; it's no wonder their music is so
    damned seamless, tight enough that they must be scripted, yet too natural and too
    bizarre to be anything but improvised. This is a group that frolics at first, loose
    notes falling where they may, only to snap to attention like a terrified private at
    the first sound of his commander's gruff voice. At times, the Goodheart Allen Powell
    Trio may seem random, but they're anything but imprecise. Continually surprising,
    yes. But not scary in the least.</p></div>"|3518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3518-i-can-climb-a-tree-i-can-tie-a-knot-i-can-have-a-conversation/|8.0|David M. Pecoraro

Namely
    raw, primal rock.  Rapeman, Big Black, Shellac, Nirvana's <i>In Utero</i>, the
    Pixies-- the man's name is practically synonymous with music that takes no
    prisoners.  His dry, treble-heavy sound has graced literally hundreds of albums
    over the past decade-and-a-half, and his style has become so developed that a lot
    of people can listen to an album and tell that he recorded it.</p><p>
    
    Considering all this, you can imagine how shocked I was to open the liner notes
    of the Frames' fourth album and see his name in there.  For the most part, <i>For
    the Birds</i> is just about the antithesis of what we've come to expect from
    Albini: gentle, hushed folk-inspired rock that only occasionally rises to a shout.
    As it turns out, Albini only helped record a few songs for the Irish quintet, and
    though it's never specified which ones, it's easy to guess.  The rest of the album
    was produced by the band with the guiding hand of dEUS's Craig Ward, who seems
    nearly as unlikely a candidate.</p><p>
<i>For the Birds</i> opens with a plaintive, soothing instrumental aptly titled
    ""In the Deep Shade.""  Guitar harmonics, brushed drums, violin and a smattering of
    piano eddy about calmly, sometimes moving forward rhythmically for a bar or two,
    but never truly settling into a prolonged groove of any kind.  It's little short
    of the perfect set-up for an album that abounds in pleasantly atmospheric, but
    rarely uninteresting, music, broken by the occasional foray into noise-drenched
    slow rock.</p><p>
    
    ""Lay Me Down"" follows, riding a constant, choppy beat and lightly picked acoustic
    guitars.  Glen Hansard's vocal melody is syncopated in such a way that it sounds
    at first like he's singing out of time.  Once you get used to his phrasing, though,
    the melody takes hold easily, contrasted by slow, droning violin interjections
    between verses.  Hansard's understated delivery also works nicely for ""What
    Happens When the Heart Just Stops,"" the quiet ballad that follows.  Subtle
    electronics weave their way through the mix, gradually becoming denser as the
    song swells to its dramatic climax, complete with a fine, Left Banke-ish horn
    section.</p><p>
    
    Though most of the album keeps the tempo held way back, a few songs manage to
    inject a faster beat, and nearly always to positive effect.  Most notable is
    ""Fighting on the Stairs,"" which is the most obvious candidate for a single.
    Programmed drums lay down an almost danceable groove for an otherwise mostly
    acoustic song, making for a nice blend of textures.  Banjo and vibes fill in
    the corners of the song, leaving room for some sort of oscillating synthesizer
    and closely harmonized vocals.</p><p>
    
    Three of these songs bear the obvious mark of Albini, each in the form of harshly
    noisy guitar passages.  The band handles noise best on ""Headlong"" by balancing it
    with resolutely melodic violin and lead guitar parts, which isn't to speak of the
    way they easily morph the gentle chorus refrain into an aching plea for help in
    the raging bridge.  The noisy passage that closes ""Santa Maria,"" however, is
    fairly shapeless, and actually detracts from an otherwise passable song.</p><p>
    
    The guitars are similarly molten on ""Early Bird,"" though the vocal melody greatly
    overpowers them in the mix.  The song quiets in the middle to allow the sinewy
    violin line to come to the fore, but is quickly swallowed again by restrained
    feedback and gritty guitar work.  Its duration is cut short by an uncharacteristic
    moment of tape manipulation, which segues surprisingly well into ""Friends and Foe,""
    which is perhaps the most subdued song here.  Subtle tremolo picking in the
    background, understated splashes from a keyboard and soft strumming are all
    Hansard has for accompaniment during the ultra-quiet verses.  A surprisingly Dirty
    Three-like violin and guitar section actually brightens the song considerably in
    the middle.</p><p>
    
    ""Disappointed"" takes the title of most lo-fi song on the album, as Hansard sounds
    like he's phoning in his performance from another town.  That's not to say his
    delivery isn't as passionate as usual, though, and his lyrics seem to sum up the
    general feel of the whole album with their refrain of ""I'm not mad/ I'm just
    disappointed.""  Comparatively, closer ""Mighty Sword"" is upbeat at its tempo of
    roughly 60 beats per minute.  The song picks up for its coda, breaking into a
    steady waltz beneath cleanly strummed guitars and theremin.</p><p>
    
    The Frames have created a unique and enjoyable album with <i>For the Birds</i>,
    one that leans decidedly away from the pop spectrum, but never sacrifices
    accessibility.  Perhaps the album's single greatest flaw is that the band have
    chosen to concentrate almost too much on the slow and sparse, but they do it well
    enough that it's hard to complain too much.  When all's said and done, <i>For the
    Birds</i> is really for just about anyone.</p></div>"|3172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3172-for-the-birds/|7.5|Joe Tangari

    Only a year ago, Flickerstick was an obscure band floating around Texas, building
    a small following, peddling their first album from the trunk of their car, and
    looking for a break.  Perseverance and hope are defining American traits, though,
    and the same urge that drives us to play the same Powerball number week after
    week (or the reflex that forces me to renew my <i>Good Housekeeping</i>
    subscription another year just to give myself a better shot at that Publisher's
    Clearing House jackpot) is the same urge that drives your typical up-and-coming
    All-American band.  The same VW van, the same stages, the same shitty equipment
    and twice married groupies... but someday, somewhere, the right person will hear
    the right demo and everything will change.  Darva Conger fantasies do come true.
    Swallow your pride for a second and you can buy your memories for the rest of
    your life.</p><p>
<i>""Don't sell out, don't sell out, don't sell out<br/>
    You compromise every word you say""</i></p><p>
    
    -""Got a Feeling"" (or ""Babe, You Done Got Yourself a Cadillac Now"")</p><p>
    
    As it turns out, Flickerstick contributed a song to a compilation of music by
    itinerant bands which the right person did hear.  The band was subsequently
    chosen by VH1 to appear on their new reality program ""Bands on the Run.""  A
    film crew was assigned to follow the group on tour and the public was treated
    to a first-hand glimpse of everyday life on the road.  The parties, the women,
    the whispered exploits previously witnessed solely by roadies and those lucky
    enough to be ""with the band"" were on display to shock, amaze and entertain
    primetime American families across the nation.  Another set of boozing, rocking,
    hotel trashing working class heroes was born.</p><p>
    
    Week after week, viewers tuned in to half-pay attention to Flickerstick's ability
    to shake off the previous night's binge and take the stage like they were trying
    too hard to be the best band in the world.  The VH1 executives were especially
    pleased with the North Texas lads.  After enduring two failed marriages, death
    threats and a total loss of privacy, Flickerstick was rewarded for their troubles
    with $50,000 cash, $100,000 in new equipment, a nationwide audience and a record
    deal with Epic.  Flickerstick had arrived.  Apparently considering the band's
    recent history-- coming off of prime time, laurel-crowned, highly visible to Epic
    higher-ups-- whoever was in charge of promoting the band decided they'd better
    take all the necessary precautions to get the new signees off on the right foot
    and not fuck things up.  The can't-miss single ""Beautiful"" was released for heavy
    circulation on radio and TV, and Tom ""Lord"" Alge, who has worked with Blink-182,
    Live and Weezer, was assigned to remix <i>Welcoming Home the Astronauts</i> for
    re-release.  Alge's thumb in the pie is immediately evident, and just as with the
    last Weezer album, you wish it wasn't there.</p><p>
<i>""Come on, I'd like to buy the world a Coke""</i></p><p>
    
    -""Coke"" (or ""And Now a Word from Our Sponsors"")</p><p>
    
    The heavy-handedness is evident from the start of the album's first track, ""Lift.""
    In what's meant to kick off the album with a sonic liftoff, which I assume
    conceptually ties in with the astronaut theme of the album's title, Brandin Lea's
    voice rises awkwardly through low electronic drones and soothing feedback in what
    turns out to be the countdown to 40 kilotons of arena-rock power chords.  It's
    clear from this moment that Alge's tweaking in the studio has little to do with
    adding anything conceptually to the album.  And conceptually, it comes off as
    little more than rehashed Boston and cover art that has as much to do with the
    contents of the album as Boston's <i>UFO's</i> have to do with ""More than a
    Feeling.""  I think we can sum it up by saying the remixing simply adds enough
    conventional gloss for FM rock to swallow it.</p><p>
    
    And while the studio work is unquestionably lackluster, it's not as if Flickerstick
    themselves really provide much of a hook for the engineers to hang their coats on,
    anyway.  The subsequent cycle of songs ranges all over the map, mixing and matching
    strains of 70s hard rock, 80s hair bands and 90s post-punk.  It's apparent this is
    a band that was caught looking for an audience.</p><p>
<i>She's only 18 but such a beautiful dream<br/>
    All she needs is some chloroform and she'll be mine</i></p><p>
    
    -""Chloroform the One you Love"" (or ""Love, in North Texas"")</p><p>
    
    The lyrics throughout <i>Welcoming Home the Astronauts</i> span a similar gamut
    of styles.  They move from senseless (""Tiny records spin holding in the air that
    you breathe/ Tearing right through the seams you sew/ It's getting right back to
    you"") to a poetic sentimentality that only manages to come across as insipid (""I
    got [more than] a feeling/ It's a feeling that you'll never understand/ It's like
    a rush to my heart that I hope never ends/ But it all depends"").  On certain
    occasions, the guys try to rise to anthemic heights, like on the Offspring riot
    calls of ""Hey or When the Drugs Wear Off.""  Or with the Go-Go's-style rave up
    ""You're So Hollywood,"" replete with ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" hand claps.  Or the
    just plain ridiculous ""Chloroform the One You Love.""</p><p>
    
    It's all pretty silly stuff, but if nothing else, it manages to establish
    Flickerstick as a frontrunner for the <i>Varsity Blues II</i> soundtrack.
    <i>Welcome Home the Astronauts</i> really only works in two instances: on the
    single, ""Beautiful,"" and the expansive ""Direct Line to the Telepathic.""  The
    latter gives the only indication of what Flickerstick could be capable of if
    only they weren't so obsessed with pandering to massive popularity.  Since this
    seems to be their immediate goal, however, and they do a good job of sticking
    to the well-trodden paths to mainstream success, I see no reason for them to
    fail, however commonplace the results.  Of course, they may self-destruct in the
    process, in which case we can look forward to seeing them in their next VH1
    special: ""Behind the Music: The Flickerstick Story.""</p></div>"|3099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3099-welcoming-home-the-astronauts/|4.5|Nathan Rooney

    Tracy Morrow (aka Ice T) was not raised in a Los Angeles ghetto. The Original
    Gangsta was actually born in another O.G.-- the Original Garden State, New Jersey.
    But no matter his roots, T had gangsta in his goddamn blood.  After his parents
    died, T realized his ice-cold destiny, determined to move to South Central and
    adopt the gangsta lifestyle. And adopt it he did, rising above his critics to rap
    convincingly about killing people, selling addictive drugs, and enjoying the
    copious bounty of many large black asses.</p><p>
    
    Luckily for Gillian Welch, the path to acclaim in the folk-country genre doesn't
    require moving to Oklahoma, Appalachia, or a Mississippi riverbank. Nor does it
    call for songs about killing people, peddling crack, or mining for black ass-gold
    (in fact, the latter is probably anathema to the cause). Rather, it's just fine if
    you sound like you know what you're doing and appreciate tradition, and Welch
    achieves that with ease.</p><p>
    
    Gillian Welch's third LP, <i>Time (The Revelator)</i> is ample proof. Despite being
    born and raised in Los Angeles, the child of a husband and wife songwriting duo
    who scored the theme to ""The Carol Burnett Show,"" Welch has managed to create some
    refreshingly charming, rustic folk-country music that bears the mark of a culture
    buried in the Blue Ridge, 3000 miles removed from her home. That she's only 33
    makes her feat of authenticity even more remarkable.</p><p>
    
    Welch's selling-point are her plaintive vocals, as tender as they are weathered.
    Her voice is, in and of itself, a stereotype of the South: genteel, soulful and
    honest. Even with seemingly frivolous lyrics like on ""Elvis Presley Blues,""
    Welch's voice expresses depth, coloring the song with experienced, time-warped
    romanticism.</p><p>
    
    Accompanying Welch on vocals is a soft palette of acoustic instrumentation.
    Although the songs carry a greater pop influence than her prior releases, the
    sound is still unmistakably country. Strummed or fingerpicked acoustic guitar
    occupies the foreground on most tracks, with the occasional twang of a banjo, as
    on the bluesy ""My First Lover.""  Adding to the spacious character of the
    orchestration is the album's absence of percussion. The result is plenty of room
    for melodies, with the focus squarely on Welch's voice.</p><p>
<i>Time (The Revelator)</i> wavers from heartbroken lament (""Revelator,""
    ""Everything Is Free"") to Southern nostalgia (""I Want to Sing that Rock n' Roll,""
    ""Red Clay Halo"") but not once does it stray from Welch's reflective, reserved
    storyteller's demeanor. The vocals and lyrics alike are open and vulnerable. More
    than simply an expression of her music, <i>Time (The Revelator)</i> is a glimpse
    into the artist's personality.</p><p>
    
    Those without the heritage need to work to attain their destiny. For Ice-T, it
    meant moving to Compton, living the life of a hustler, and filming cinematic
    masterpieces like <i>Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo</i> and <i>Frankenpenis</i>.
    For Gillian Welch, it meant studying at Berklee School of Music and listening to
    old Delmore Brothers and Carter Family recordings. Whatever her path, though, her
    results are as good as the original.</p></div>"|8620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8620-time-the-revelator/|8.1|Brad Haywood

    with a little more chaotic joy in my life.  It seems that, of all the things to
    come out of the New York City underground in the 90s, this music has been the
    most massively appealing.  Some of the city's biggest names have this trend to
    thank for their prosperity: Dave Douglas (with John Zorn's Masada, and his own
    Tiny Bell Trio), Chris Speed (Pachora, Erik Friedlander), and Jim Black (Pachora,
    Tiny Bell Trio) all made major statements playing this music.  Bands like Pachora,
    Masada and Hasidic New Wave take the traditional harmony and melody of Klezmer and
    other Eastern European music, and fuse it with contemporary rhythms and
    improvisation concepts, quite often coming up with entirely fresh sounds.  The
    only problem is that the concept behind the music can never really make the music
    itself inherently fun to listen to.</p><p>
    
    I will say that <i>From the Belly of Abraham</i> isn't exciting for me not because
    of its now-familiar fusion of Klezmer and jazz, but because of its relentlessly
    ""lite"" (a feat, considering that the playing is theoretically closer to John Zorn
    than David Sanborn) and/or ""smooth"" atmosphere.  Where I want a hard beat or
    recklessly inspired head, I get ultra-clean production and ""tasty,"" ""in the pocket""
    and ""tight"" grooves.  Where I beg for something interesting, or just something to
    get me on my feet, I get something close to the Saturday Night Live Band playing
    Masada tunes.</p><p>
    
    More amazing is that Hasidic New Wave is made of guys I love: Frank London is an
    excellent trumpet player, who I first heard on Zorn's classical work <i>Kristallnacht</i>,
    but is equally adept at straight-ahead jazz; Greg Wall is a similarly excellent
    tenor sax player, who has the chops and voice to make music ten times more
    distinct than this; David Fuiczynski is an incredible guitarist, and I've never
    heard him so laid back (read: muffled) as on this release; drummer Aaron Alexander
    has worked with folks like Satoko Fujii and Tim Berne.  It just doesn't stand to
    reason that they would form a band that plays relatively smooth jazz.</p><p>
    
    To top it off, they brought in a Senegalese drum ensemble called Yakar Rhythms,
    a trio of percussionists playing some very complex, kinetic patters under all of
    the tunes on this album.  This really is neat stuff, and I wouldn't mind if
    someone removed all of the band tracks and just let me listen to Yakar Rhythms
    play.  But that isn't an option.  In any case, they do lend an air of eccentricity
    and genuine excitement to the mix.</p><p>
    
    The first song is ""Waaw-Waaw"" (written by bassist Fima Ephon), and it's clear from
    the start that Hasidic New Wave will take the beaten path.  London's expert muted
    trumpet lead is doubled by tenor over a slow jam beat and repetitive bassline.  As
    Yakar Rhythms reel off polyrhythms in the background  (yes, the production,
    unfortunately, views this trio as a background element, rather than letting their
    infectious energy take the lead), the sheer precision and efficiency of the band's
    playing starts to get me down.  There's an interesting invocation from one of the
    Yakar (presumably in Senegalese) that threatens to bring the tune out of its
    studio-pro rut, but ultimately to no avail.</p><p>
    
    ""Yemin HaShem"" is a new arrangement of a 19th century Jewish hymn, and begins
    promisingly with a mournful exposition that quickly leads to a fantastic
    percussion solo.  But just as the energy gets good, and the whole thing seems on
    the verge of explosion, they commence a fairly standard James Brown (think ""Cold
    Sweat,"" but accompanied by Senegalese drummers, of course) groove.  Why?  They
    play the tune proper over this groove (even going so far as to add the redoubtable
    Jamie Saft on funky organ), and I wonder how the Saturday Night Live Band would
    sound playing this.  Probably about the same, even down to the typically expert
    tenor solo.</p><p>
    
    It isn't all a downer: Fiuczynski's ""Frydginator"" takes the exotic beats and comes
    with a manic head to match the intensity.  Yes, it sounds more than a little like
    Masada, but then it's basically straight Klezmer with a jazz bent, so that's
    understandable.  Also, the solos are very nice, with Wall and London trading
    fours with real energy and-- very important-- seemingly little concern for hitting
    a wrong note, playing out of tune, or sounding ""tight.""  I hear some people
    actually go for this type of thing rather than my preferred ""noise"" music (read:
    music you're not likely to play at a dinner party and/or hear on NPR), but I just
    have a hard time getting past the perfectly fine-ness of it.</p></div>"|3760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3760-from-the-belly-of-abraham/|5.3|Dominique Leone

    worried about looking like some soulless corporate-rock posterboy.  Thankfully,
    Macha put musicianship first.  After a trip to Indonesia, the four-piece fused
    indie rock with Eastern instrumentation, resulting in polyrhythmic songs full of
    plucked zithers, hammered dulcimers and ringing metallophones.  Some said that
    Atlanta's Macha-men, by using conventional lyrics and choruses, had missed the
    point: reaching a state of trance.  But fusion was the point, and during their
    live shows with Bedhead, as Macha constantly switched between instruments and
    launched into intense jams, you could hear an enlightening vibe far more exciting
    than any Jah Wobble world-beat kitsch.</p><p>
    
    Seaworthy is the solo project of Macha frontman Josh McKay.  He's caught between
    his past and future on <i>The Ride</i>, which ditches Eastern instruments for the
    most part but still focuses on layered waves of sound (though in an altogether
    more smooth and subtle approach).  The ambiance on this LP carries hints of McKay's
    pre-Macha days in Emperor Moth, a brooding rock trio from Gainesville, Florida.
    All three of McKay's projects reveal his draw towards the tension created by the
    drone, and the moody keyboards and deep basslines here were captured perfectly in
    the mix done at Andy LeMaster's Chase Park Transduction studio in Athens.  McKay's
    balance between abstraction and conventional songwriting has yielded another
    great album.</p><p>
<i>The Ride</i> begins with ""Open the Gates,"" as a lumbering dreadnought of a
    guitar riff plows through staccato percussion and harpsichord-like ornamentation.
    The sinewy lines segue directly into ""I Met Her in the Candy Store.""  The guitars
    become muted and the sinister feeling fades, replaced by creaking scrapes of
    feedback crenellated along the main bass groove.  McKay's breathy vocals barely
    raise above a whisper, but they manage to make the otherwise-edgy music strangely
    inviting.  His hushed phrasings are difficult to decipher, but you can make out,
    ""Your voice invites everyone into contact with your thoughts.""  This piece glides
    into ""Sea Manta,"" a wavering, aquatic instrumental similar to Tortoise's ""Dear
    Grandma and Grandpa.""</p><p>
    
    ""Lone Star Samba"" is more easily accessible.  A hi-hat ticks incessantly amongst
    other soft percussive rumblings, as McKay warmly sings, ""Talk to me, through the
    bedroom wall/ Does your guard come down, when I'm not around?""  The second verse
    begins with vibraphone rolls eddying upward.  Snippets of sampled conversation
    begin to appear in the song, little giggles and laughs punctuating the mix with a
    sense of intimacy.  ""You and me, just one more hour""-- a statement, or a plea?</p><p>
    
    Instead of revelation, a pulsing drone washes into a canyon of reverb on ""In
    Anticipation Of,"" a short prelude to ""The Day,"" one of two surprisingly great pop
    tracks that appear in the middle of the album.  Prolific Japanese musician Haco
    glows here, her voice patiently pausing and then echoing dramatically over plodding
    drums and the accompaniment of ringing bell sounds.  ""Identifying the Body"" features
    vocals from Azure Ray seraph Orenda Fink.  Trip-hop beats shuffle while Fink's
    electronically filtered voice reaches an otherworldly androgyny, even if the hook
    sounds like Bono on ""The Fly.""  This song just soars, all the more surprising that
    it leads into a disappointing closer.  The two-part title track ""The Ride"" aims
    for the blissed-out distortion of REM's ""Let Me In,"" but the avant-garde vocal
    harmony sounds as annoying as the choral theatrics Cerberus Shoal has been into
    lately.  The dense, wheezing soundbursts aren't awful, but after so many successful
    tracks, this murky sequence is a letdown.</p><p>
    
    The photos on the sleeve cover of <i>The Ride</i> are all of bodies: a woman
    wrapped in a towel, only visible by the light from a window; a color shot of
    someone's back, shadow-lit and androgynous; a close-up of someone's long, curly
    hair.  I wonder whether the concept (signifiers: the sampled conversation, the
    song titles, the printed lyrics for the title track) is just about a relationship,
    or maybe also its collapse.  The narrative flow is enthralling, and might be a
    good opiate during those times.  It's the first good 2002 album I've heard, and I
    didn't even get annoyed at the nautical theme.</p></div>"|7050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7050-the-ride/|8.1|Christopher Dare

    her debut full-length breaks new ground for mediocrity. In fact, it's hard to
    imagine a more non-offensive collection of songs that take you neither one way
    nor the other.  <i>New Problems</i> is not bad enough to warrant serious disdain,
    but neither is it exciting, original, insightful, inspiring, cathartic, or any of
    the other things I look for in a listening experience.  If I could, I'd give this
    album a rating of 5.00000 to emphasize just how middling it is.  Even a bunch of
    guest musicians-- Tara Jane O'Neil, Schickele's former Beekeeper bandmate Jan Kotik,
    and most of the rest of Ida-- couldn't add anything redeeming.</p><p>
    
    Things look bleak from the outset.  First there's the whole Ida/Lisa Loeb
    connection (need I explain?), and secondly, the song ""Telegram"" is a Silvia
    Plath poem is set to music.  I don't know about you, but I can't stand Silvia
    Plath.  Not only does she represent the height of poetic pretension to me, but
    the people who are into her writings are arguably more intolerable than her
    poetry.</p><p>
    
    Strangely enough, ""Telegram"" was the song I enjoyed the most on the album, if you
    want to call it ""enjoying."" Let's say that, after hearing it, I shrugged and said
    ""eh"" to myself with slightly less vigor than with the other songs. But like the
    rest of the album, it sat firmly at the tolerable level. It's a slightly bluesy,
    bare-bones type of song-- just acoustic guitar and voice-- and at least for this
    one track, Schickele doesn't try too hard to be cute or emotive.</p><p>
    
    ""Reminder"" serves as the emotional highpoint of the album, a cautionary tale about
    getting involved with the wrong guy. It contains some pretty cheesy lines like,
    ""I don't know your score but I know you're a player/ I know you're gonna break my
    heart sooner or later.""  If nothing else, the song is performed with a little
    conviction, though with no better way to express it than a little noisy bit at
    song's end.  The rest of the album just sort of sits there staring at you, neither
    forcing you to get up and turn it off nor leaving you with the desire to hear it
    again.</p><p>
    
    Interestingly enough, in the brief ""Always So Good,"" Schickele provides the final
    word on <i>New Problems</i>. Riding a simplified Nick Drake-like guitar figure,
    Schickele repeats, ""It's always so good but it's never the same.""  I can't help
    but think the opposite about this album: always the same and never so good.</p></div>"|4369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4369-new-problems/|5.0|Jason Nickey

    a passing notice. Banks and schools close and there's a brief blurb on the news.
    But otherwise little notice is paid. Maybe human relations have come so far since
    King's day that we've forgotten it was no more than four decades ago when things
    were far different. Maybe. Yet for all the advances our society has made in
    civility over the last 40 years, we've still got a long way to go. Racism still
    exists, albeit more subtly than before. Far less subtle in today's society is
    hatred aimed toward homosexuals, immigrants and robots. Yes, I said robots.</p><p>
    
    For years robots have been denied the rights you and enjoy each and every day.
    They're thought of as mere machines, no one ever taking into account that they
    might just be programmed to feel the pain inflicted by such callous ignorance.
    And the media is no better. For decades now, TV and movies portrayed robots as
    killers, servants, single-minded ignoramuses incapable of love, art or beauty.
    But this is a cultural stereotype, as inaccurate as any other. What about the
    good robots out there? The relentless workers, the visionaries, the musicians?</p><p>
    
    That's right. Robots can make music, too. And I'm not talking about the current
    legions of Powerbook-toting humans. I'm talking about real robots. Like the ones
    Pierre Bastien employs on his new release <i>Mecanoid</i>. They're small, simple
    machines, built by the artist out of Maccano parts and small electric motors,
    single-mindedly devoted to making music. According to the liner notes, these
    robots play everything from castanets and marimbas to thumb pianos and seven-inch
    records to steel-drum and an assortment of ancient instruments from around the
    world.</p><p>
    
    It's a fair bet that any album that employs such a wide variety of instruments
    will have a pretty unique, fairly interesting sound. And that <i>Mecanoid</i> does.
    But this doesn't even take into account the instruments Bastien plays; stand-up
    bass, electric piano, organ, horns (both prepared and traditional), and some more
    obscure instruments that I can't even picture. Indeed, this is a disc filled from
    start to finish with a massive range of sounds. But what about the music?</p><p>
    
    The robots' musical abilities are limited by their simplicity. They play their
    instrument with no divergence from a predetermined pattern, essentially creating
    loops. As such, there's an air of monotony to some of this music-- a clunking,
    mechanical feel. But when a number of these robots are employed at once, their
    individual patterns inevitably converge in an infinite number of ways. Bastien
    makes use of this tendency, setting any number of robots into action, allowing
    their music to fall into a groove, and then adding flourishes himself where
    necessary. Most songs start slow and then creep along, with an inhuman determination
    until they reach their conclusion. It's actually quite fascinating-- often hypnotic--
    and most of the songs are short enough that they come to an end long before they
    cease to be interesting.</p><p>
    
    Bastien speaks to the hints of inevitability in his music, choosing palindromes
    for the titles to each of his songs. The titles, he says, ""reflect the way these
    little machines function, whether they are read forwards or backwards, they are
    understood the same way and this coming or going of words/notes can be imagined
    as an infinite cycle.""</p><p>
    
    ""Tender Red Net"" is a calm, peaceful number that begins as a duet between Bastien
    on organ and a machine playing marimbas. As it moves on, we hear various clankings
    in the background, rhythmic record scratches and the soothing melody of low-pitched
    strings. ""Revolt Lover"" features Bastien on prepared trumpet and bass while his
    robots manipulate records, suggesting that he puts just as much thought into his
    own arrangements as those of his machines. On ""Deep Speed,"" Bastien mics the
    machines themselves and arranges their movements into a rhythm which accompanies
    a machine playing Casiotone and Bastien's jazzed-up trumpet riffs.</p><p>
    
    No doubt many will dismiss this album as a gimmick, which is a damned shame. The
    music made by Bastien and his robot band is every bit as delicate and unique as
    the methods by which it was created. These machines never give up and Bastien
    promises to keep working with them. Who knows what sort of music he'll be able to
    create as his machines continue to evolve. And if we ever see a Robot Rights
    movement, there's no telling what might happen.</p></div>"|583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/583-mecanoid/|8.6|David M. Pecoraro

    computer is not a cold, inherently impersonal entity. Unlike more utilitarian
    electronic items (calculators, microwaves, etc), computers can be endowed by
    their owners with a sometimes startling degree of personality. Countless hours of
    work are often put into creating a computer that bears the characteristics of its
    owner, or at least the characteristics that its owner wants it to possess.</p><p>
    
    And yet, many people still seem to be reluctant to acknowledge that something
    warm, organic, and truly personal can emerge from the silicon belly of a Powerbook--
    especially when it comes to music. Journalists have been going on for ages about
    some pieces of wood, molded metal, and a few electromagnets being an extension of
    the penis.  What's so different about the concept of a laptop being an extension
    of the laptop?  No, a computer can't be physically smacked around like a guitar
    or a set of drums, but its nearly limitless potential for the creation and

    gray area somewhere between a composition and an improvisation. Since this is the
    first time these songs have been released, it's impossible to know how much of
    the album is premeditated.</p><p>
    
    The results of O'Rourke's half-improvisations are absolutely stunning. <i>I'm
    Happy, and I'm Singing, and a 1, 2, 3, 4</i> is comprised of sounds too intricate
    and complex to be the product of spontaneous experimentation. But unlike many
    albums consisting of such sounds, this album moves at the speed of human thought,
    developing in a subtle, methodical, yet never cold and technical manner. Changes
    happen slowly enough that you can fully take in every nuance, yet nothing ever
    seems obvious.</p><p>
    
    ""I'm Happy"" opens the record with nondescript glitchy sine waves playing a sparse,
    quiet pattern. That pattern swells to a buzzing mass of sound so dense that it
    seems to comprise a single melodic entity. Gradually, O'Rourke manipulates this
    one central sonic pillar, adding sounds that vary slightly in melody and timbre.
    And somehow, he manages to keep ""I'm Happy"" dense enough to be completely
    enveloping, while still open enough to be noticeably transformed by every one of
    its individual voices. About halfway through the track, a series of subtle melodic
    changes and the addition of a humming bass drone drastically alter the character
    of the song, though the elements comprising remain largely unchanged.</p><p>
    
    Though ""I'm Happy"" fades out with a few moments of dark ambience, the following
    track, ""And I'm Singing,"" showcases a more playful side of O'Rourke's laptop.
    Opening with the stuttered sounds of a timer and chime, ""And I'm Singing"" then
    sees him using looped keyboards and synthesized sounds to create what could best
    be described as a single fragment of a gorgeous melody frozen in time. Strange,
    ambiguous percussive sounds create a controlled cacophony, until the song
    metamorphoses into a minimalistic arrangement of clean and distorted synthesized
    blips. A single array of melodies is repeated, developing so slowly that it can
    barely be noticed. It then flows seamlessly into what could be the album's finest
    moment: a progression of odd, ambiguous sounds backed by distorted sine waves and
    acoustic guitar. Like its predecessor, ""And I'm Singing"" ends with a brief period
    of subdued ambience.</p><p>
    
    Whereas ""I'm Happy"" and "" And I'm Singing"" often use a flurry of individual sounds
    to create the illusion tranquility, ""And a 1, 2, 3, 4"" is much more sparse,
    allowing the listener to focus more closely on every sound O'Rourke uses. And the
    sounds themselves are utterly gorgeous-- subtly manipulated strings that quiver
    and pulsate in slow, sweeping gestures, constantly arranging themselves into new
    harmonic patterns. As more voices are added, these patterns become more complex
    and more regular until the end of the song, at which point O'Rourke gently
    deconstructs the layers of sound that have been building for over fifteen minutes
    with the introduction of new, thoroughly engaging sounds that function almost
    like a screen behind which the song can dismantle itself.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, <i>I'm Happy, and I'm Singing, and a 1, 2, 3, 4</i>, despite its
    somewhat ridiculous title and its digital origins, is a startlingly personal,
    affecting album, drawing as much on the fragile melodicism of folk music as the
    technical manipulation of minimalism. And considering the strength of the bond
    that can develop between a man and his machine, this record may be O'Rourke's
    most direct statement to date.</p></div>"|6041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6041-im-happy-and-im-singing-and-a-1-2-3-4/|9.0|Matt LeMay

    for much.  Sure, the place has a couple of perennially mediocre
    sports franchises and a yearly drunken redneck gathering
    disguised as an auto race, but that's about it. It's a place
    people pass through to get to someplace else.  It's also a
    pretty weak place musically, save for a few stalwart soldiers
    fighting the good fight.</p><p>
    
    But it wasn't always that way, as this comp attests. No longer
    should Indy cling to such weak sources of musical renown as
    ""home of hardcore legends the Zero Boys""-- not when they can
    lay claim to the Highlighters Band. In fact, the city's
    visitors bureau and chamber of commerce would play Highlighters'
    singles in their lobbies if the knew what was up, and they'd
    have plaques on their walls reading, ""Indianapolis, the city
    that inspired Bay Area DJ par excellence Peanut Butter Wolf
    to put together one of the greatest funk comps ever.""</p><p>
    
    The story goes like this: while on a cross-country bowling
    excursion (that's right) and record search, Wolf stopped in
    Naptown and was introduced to Highlighters sax player Clifford
    Palmer. Palmer played Wolf some of his band's old 45s and Wolf
    was so taken by them that he decided his next project for
    Stones Throw (his label, which put out Madlib's Quasimoto and
    Yesterday's New Quintet projects, among others) would be a
    massive old school funk comp.</p><p>
    
    And it's damn good, compiled with a curator's eye for detail,
    from the pacing of the tracks to the meticulous liner notes.
    And what incredible range of styles: hard funk, smooth soul
    funk, jazz funk, instrumentals, shout-outs, anti-drug anthems,
    positive ghetto jams, and every kind of post-JB funk you can
    imagine-- seventy-plus minutes, all recorded between 1968 and
    1974 (though most of it's from between '70-'72).</p><p>
    
    To be fair, not all the bands here are from Indianapolis, just
    the best of the batch. The aforementioned Highlighters give
    the comp its title with their titular contribution, which
    tries to out-James Brown James Brown and comes as close as
    humanly possible. Then there's Billy Ball and the Upsetters
    featuring Roosevelt Matthews with ""Tighten Up Tighter"" and
    its supercharged Booker T. groove; the Ebony Rhythm Band, who
    provide the comp with excellent intro and outro excerpts; and
    radio DJ-gone-funk-band-leader Spider Harrison with the
    lurching syncopation of ""Beautiful Day.""</p><p>
    
    Of the non-Indy bands, there are several standouts, but the
    most surprising is Bad Medicine, made up of a bunch of white
    guys from upstate New York. Their ""Trespasser"" is what you
    might call canonical funk: after hearing it, when you hear
    the word ""funk,"" this will be the sound you imagine.  It's
    pristine and by the books, but dead-on perfect.  There are
    two Texas Bands with killer cuts, too: Dallas' Soul Seven,
    whose conservatory skills present maybe the hardest, rawest
    funk of the lot, and Houston's Kashmere Stage Band, who take
    the big band approach to funk.</p><p>
    
    If there's a problem with <i>The Funky 16 Corners</i>, it's
    that it's exhausting to listen to all the way through. The
    energy is kept at such a level that it's best to break it
    down into two or three sessions-- don't try and take it in
    all at once.  You'll collapse.</p></div>"|2002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2002-the-funky-16-corners/|9.5|Jason Nickey

Pat was deliciously
    sarcastic, exhibiting a dune-dry sense of humor and scalpel wit
    rarely hinted at in his on-air demeanor. Snyder eventually
    goaded Sajak into telling viewers the stupidest thing he'd ever
    heard a contestant say. Sajak smiled mischievously and told
    the story of a woman who, faced with the following puzzle--
    ""A_raham _inco_n""-- enthusiastically chirped ""Abraham Bincoln.""</p><p>
    
    Snyder and Sajak had a good chuckle over this, like the Burbank
    TV bastards they are, and moved on to some vaguely tawdry
    discussion of Vanna White or something.  Anyway, after hearing
    <i>Psychedelicate</i> for the third or fourth time, it occurred
    to me that this would be pretty terrible music to listen to
    before a test, before taking the stand as a witness, or before
    a job interview. The album's disorientingly lush sound does
    to your mind what the invisible protagonist of that old Hellen
    Keller joke does to her living room: walks in, moves shit
    around, and leaves you bumping misplaced couches and sitting
    on toilet plungers. If you're not careful it could have you
    guessing ""Bincoln"" over and over.</p><p>
    
    Yes, Motor City damsels the Slumber Party have put together a
    lovely codeine- and absinthe-tinged pop platter that should
    put a stupid, happy smile on your face even as it puts you to
    sleep. If your mom had been the coolest mom on the block she
    might have sung you these tunes as lullabies.</p><p>
    
    Alicia Berg's children, if she has any, might someday boast of
    having had the coolest mom on the block. Her airy voice is the
    focal point of Slumber Party's music, and her melodies keep
    things charmingly soporific. Berg's voice is like a less nasal
    Nico, minus the Euro-accent and thankfully free of that
    existential misery the Velvets' singer was so obsessed with.</p><p>
    
    Drowsiness is the main side effect of Slumber Party's music--
    who'd have thought?-- but there's much for the alert mind to
    enjoy here.  Matthew Smith (of the Volebeats and Outrageous
    Cherry) produced this reverb-party of an album and his sonic
    stewardship is even and expert. The album never jars, and one
    scarcely notices the transitions from kit drums to Casio-beats,
    instead concentrating on the constant dialogue between Berg's
    vocal lines and Gretchen Gonzales' meandering guitar work.</p><p>
    
    ""Bag of Spiders,"" and ""Everyone Else I Know,"" the latter of
    which sounds a bit like a low-budget Stereolab, are the
    album's standouts. Then again, all the songs are fairly good,
    if basically interchangeable. The Velvet Underground and the
    vocal delivery of Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval are the usual
    sonic touchstones in describing Slumber Party's music. Neither
    example, however, comes especially close to the mark. There's
    a bouncy optimism and space to these songs that defy references
    to older, darker material.  So what if the title sounds like one
    of those insipid ""Before and After"" puzzles on ""Wheel?""</p></div>"|7254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7254-psychedelicate/|7.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    You know, the ones who hung out at the mall on weekends,
    drinking Starbuck's coffee and eating McDonald's? Well,
    <i>Perdition City</i>, the new album from Christophorus G.
    Rygg and Tore Yiwizaker (aka Ulver) is a lot like that. We're
    talking lite goth-industrial mixed with smooth-jazz and lame
    electronic music (the kind so bad it's actually deserving of
    the derogatory term often used by chain music stores:
    ""electronica""). In other words, total and utter crap.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, the first few seconds of <i>Perdition City</i>
    offers some potential. The first track, ""Lost in Moments,""
    opens with a driving drum-machine beat heavily treated in
    reverb, reminiscent of the sort that often found its way into
    early 70s psychedelia. After about 20 seconds of this, the
    beat drops out, and it's contrasted with a few sparse piano
    chords, and random vocals-- likely from an ill-tuned radio--
    in the distance. All's well so far. And then comes the
    saxophone. Guest musician Rolf Erik Nystrom plays sax with
    the schmaltziest of them, which, to be fair, is a perfect
    match for the vocals-- would-be-savvy, seductive male crooning
    that briefly flirts with the idea of carrying the song before
    mercifully disappearing again.  As the sax thankfully leaves
    with the vocals, the drum machine and piano return. But even,
    in this new context, they sound plastic and uninspired. By the
    time the song draws to a close with ominous minor chords,
    whooshing wind-sounds and a crackly-voiced narration, you have
    to wonder how anyone's supposed to take this seriously.</p><p>
    
    Even more laughable are the liner notes, which-- if one can
    wade through the pretentious nonsense like, ""I know now that
    the underworld is incalculable. To describe it we rely
    exclusively on tones, sounds, rhythm and pure instrumentality""--
    divulge that these guys consider Coil an influence. Excuse me
    while I retreat to a corner and snicker to myself. Loud enough
    that people on the other side of the room can hear.</p><p>
    
    What these guys don't seem to realize, is that layering some
    ""creepy"" vocals (""Ghosts presence/ Ghost music from the radio
    at night and you can't sleep"") over a vaguely ambient backdrop
    that sounds like an amateur rendition of ""Who Will Fall"" (as
    they do on-- snicker snicker-- ""We Are the Dead"") does not
    make you Coil. It makes you a Coil rip-off. A blatant one.
    You see, Ulver makes music that is ""dark"" and ""ominous""
    without actually posing any legitimate threat, not unlike
    those two girls you knew back in high school.</p><p>
    
    Really. I can't even begin to comprehend how anyone who listens
    to Coil could release music this corny and live with themselves.
    Coil is legitimately frightening. Ulver is frightening like a
    made-for-TV horror movie is frightening. Ulver makes music for
    people who want to convince themselves that they dig creepy
    music without ever having to worry about nervously glancing
    over their shoulder or feeling their pulse rise.</p><p>
    
    For Christ's sake, on ""Catalept,"" they actually sample Bernard
    Herrmann's theme from <i>Psycho</i>. Sorry, guys, but after Busta
    Rhymes uses it, it no longer falls into the ""creepy"" category.
    Furthermore, the creepiest music in the world generally ceases
    to be creepy when attached to a drum-machine beat that for all
    intents and purposes might be named ""Demo.""</p><p>
    
    Still, I'm all about giving credit where credit is due, and I
    must give Ulver points for variety. According to their website,
    Rygg and Yiwizaker hail from the Norwegian metal scene, pinning
    <i>Perdition City</i> as something of a departure from their
    norm. Even among the tracks on the album, the duo tries out a
    few different styles. Besides the pseudo-industrial tracks,
    there's also ""Hallways of Always,"" a lame excursion into the
    world of Casio-based electronics, and ""Porn Piece or the Scars
    of Cold Kisses,"" which takes a stab at bad adult-contemporary
    balladry and disguises it with Casio-based electronics.</p><p>
    
    Who knows? Maybe <i>Perdition City</i> was nothing more than a
    well-intentioned but ultimately ill-advised experiment for
    these guys. Maybe, in their more traditional form, Ulver is a
    really solid metal band. If that's the case, well, you can't
    blame a band for trying something different. That said, Ulver
    might want to consider a return to their metal roots.  If I
    want to hear something creepy, I'll stick to the real thing.</p></div>"|8342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8342-perdition-city/|2.6|David M. Pecoraro

    writing this review as a single run-on sentence.  This is,
    after all, music that drones on and on with nary a single bit
    of punctuation to be found.  In fact, on first listen, I didn't
    make it past the second track.  But, as I'm duty-bound to
    actually listen to everything I review, I spun it again a few
    days later with the volume up some and it revealed itself to
    be, well, not so terrible I couldn't take it in one sitting.</p><p>
    Seven listens later, I'm a bit divided on what to tell you
    about Charity Empressa's self-titled debut album.  I suppose
    starting with some background couldn't hurt, so I'll offer
    this for you to chew on while I gather my thoughts: Charity
    Empressa is a two-man unit comprised of Eric Campuzano of the
    Lassie Foundation, assisted by a guy who goes by ""The Frank
    Lenz Foundation.""  They're helped out by a wide-ranging cast
    of guest vocalists and instrumentalists, though it's never
    made very clear who contributes what, or even what some of the
    musicians play.  In passing, I'll mention that Charity
    Empressa are openly and forthrightly Christian, but it barely
    matters, as only one moment on the whole record even evidences
    that fact.</p><p>
<i>Charity Empressa</i> begins with a series of layered,
    vacuum-packed drones and some new age keyboards that are
    initially rather pleasant.  ""This is a nice intro,"" you think,
    easing back in your chair.  The only problem is that an intro
    needs a song to be a part of, and most introductions aren't
    over four minutes long.  A pall of hazy reverb and drones
    hangs as though dead, daubed with noodling on the brightly
    toned keyboard.  Even the programmed drum beat that comes in
    near the end doesn't make it more interesting.  Hell, you
    can't even hear it if you don't have your stereo turned up
    loud enough.  By the time they actually decide to shift the
    overall texture, you've stopped listening.  The shift doesn't
    really lead to a higher gear, either, and the song just kind
    of evaporates.  Ironically, they've chosen to title the song
    ""Are We There Yet?""</p><p>
    The second track, ""Carew,"" answers that question by saying, ""No,
    but here's a trumpet.""  Over basically the same foundation,
    guest trumpeter Matt Fronke does his best 1969 Miles Davis
    impression, and to his credit, it's the third most interesting
    thing on the entire album.  The main problem occurs when you
    realize that he isn't really playing much of a theme-- rather,
    he's simply wandering in a droning wasteland of shimmery
    texture.  Shortened to thirty seconds, this would have made a
    fine outro to an early Verve b-side, but here it just drags
    on and on.</p><p>
    ""Future King of England"" adds some heavily phased vocals from
    Wayne Fernandez Everett.  Everett's sense of key is interpretive
    at best, and the whole thing plays largely like a tribute to
    the haunting vocal break of Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s
    ""Providence"" slathered in a big, silky drone.  It's pretty
    and all, but why it lasts over six minutes is beyond me,
    considering that, by then, it's exhausted its welcome three
    times over.</p><p>
    This brings us to the second most interesting moment on this
    album: the vaguely Eastern ""May the Good Lord Find You.""  A
    steady tabla beat chugs away in the background, marching
    through a mist of that same drone that covers everything else.
    Guest vocalist Raquel Munoz offers a decent melody for the
    first time on the record, and the song is actually short
    enough not to grow tiresome.  Any renewed interest is quickly
    squelched, however, by ""Give 'Em Hell,"" 10\xBD minutes of drone
    that services their own title's request.  At first, the drone
    is mixed with some fairly neat static, and somewhat regular
    hand percussion moves in and out of the background at a few
    points, but there's virtually nothing to justify the song's
    length.  In the end, the swelling hum comes across about as
    interesting as an academic demonstration of an early FM
    synthesizer.</p><p>
    ""The Crush of the Mountains"" is only slightly more interesting,
    and this is due to vocalist Matt Kelly, whose multi-tracked
    melody saves it from all-out numbing boredom, but does little
    to contour it.  Thankfully, it's followed by what is far and
    away the best thing Charity Empressa have to offer-- a unique
    track called ""Shake Your Money Maker.""  The song samples a
    1939 recording by the Albert Francis Trio of a song called
    ""The Risen Savior and the Rhythm Maker,"" taken from the
    Library of Congress archives.  At less than three minutes,
    it's the perfect length, and the backing provided by the band
    for the sample is unusually vibrant and rhythmic.  Funky
    little bass figures dance around busily tapping rhythms, and
    the drones, though present, are kept largely to a minimum.</p><p>
    Of the remaining four songs, only one stands out at all.
    ""Stay Gold"" follows the same drone blueprint, adding a little
    bit of guitar, which inevitably merges with the rest of the
    background.  ""Cool as Cranes"" is an ephemeral wisp of a song
    buried deep in stationary drones.  ""Breathing is Good,"" which
    is largely the same thing with a female vocalist, is equally
    brief and inconsequential.  Finally, closer ""The Kool Kids and
    Rok and Roll"" comes in with some strong male vocals, an actual
    bassline, and some maracas to keep time.  Initially, there
    are no drones at all, and the first one to enter is provided
    not by big, gauzy, echoing synths, but an organ.  The lyrics
    are quaint, referencing the MC5 and the Rolling Stones and
    calling on God to bless rock and roll.  Of course, by the
    song's end, it's enveloped once again by big, drony synths,
    and it ends sounding much like it began-- listless and
    unobtrusive.</p><p>
    And with that the disc is over, and we come to the reason I'm
    so divided on what to say about this album.  I actually like
    the sound of it a lot, but it never takes that intriguing
    sound and does enough with it for me.  Likewise, I know there
    are people out there who will lap this up quite enthusiastically.
    If you're into drone outfits like Stars of the Lid, for example,
    there's probably a lot to like for you about Charity Empressa.
    However, for me, this record simply doesn't succeed on most
    levels.  And that's all I've got to say.</p></div>"|1400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1400-charity-empressa/|4.9|Joe Tangari

    rock. A cult favorite ever since Nick Saloman created the band
    in the 80s, it has stayed with a heavy 60s-style psychedelic
    sound, resisting all Brit-pop fashion and trends.  Over the
    years, the Frond has grown from a one-man band recording in a
    bedroom to a trio that works in an actual studio; but listening
    to the first few records-- now back in print thanks to Rubric
    Records-- it's surprising to hear how little the man has
    changed.</p><p>
    
    As shown on the Frond's third album, <i>Triptych</i>, Saloman
    has always had a mature, unpretentious, and frankly, drug-free
    sensibility. Under all the exotica and period sounds, he makes
    what is, at its core, meat-and-potatoes rock. Modern audiences
    can dig the quirks and humor without hearing addled lyrics
    about how far away the singer's hand looks at the end of his
    arm. Saloman employs eloquent, left-field imagery to address
    concrete, sometimes mundane subjects-- getting old, going to
    court, dealing with the old man who owns the guitar shop-- and
    his swagger-free voice and genuine English accent lend the
    wordplay conviction.</p><p>
    
    Every song has a great hook or riff, and Saloman's guitar sears
    across these lo-fi recordings. The solos jam icicles in your
    eyeballs. The riffs slam your solar plexus. The few long jams
    stick to fundamentals and eschew free-form noodling. He sounds
    like he could go on forever, yet he manages to stop before you
    feel like checking your watch.</p><p>
<i>Triptych</i> was originally self-released by Saloman in 1988,
    and he took a few liberties with the recording. He gave his
    four-year-old daughter a percussion feature; she's okay. He
    invited his mum to sing on his cover of ""Hey Joe""; she's
    brilliant. (Only David Letterman has put a mother to better
    use in the service of art.) On the other hand, the two
    instrumentals just fill space-- album opener ""Into the Cryptic
    Myst,"" a bland relic that does nothing but set the mood, and
    ""Phil Exorcises the Daemons,"" a short piece with drummer Phil
    Collyer that never takes off.</p><p>
    
    Around those tangents sit some of the Frond's best pop songs.
    ""Lights Are Changing"" rides on a Byrds-like riff and a catchy
    chorus. Mary Lou Lord almost had a hit with her cover of this
    song, but her glossy, nice-girl spin on the tune can't compare
    to this raw original, where Saloman pushes his vocals higher
    than they can comfortably go. It's followed by more fine
    retro-pop: Saloman splays killer riffs and a two-guitar attack
    across ""Gemini Machine"" and ""Nowhere Fast,"" while the ballads
    ""Old Man Blank"" and ""Corinthian"" have gentle vocals and
    classic flower power organ lines.</p><p>
    
    The album closes with ""Hey Joe"" and six catchy but inessential
    bonus tracks. They're a breath of cool air after the centerpiece
    of the album: ""Tangerine Infringement Beak,"" a twenty-minute
    one-man jam session that Saloman plays like the Four Horsemen
    of Garage Rock. Sprawling and unruly, it treads perilously
    near total indulgence-- but closer inspection reveals that the
    song is neatly organized into sections and paced for maximum
    effect. And when Saloman runs out of lyrics, he admits it and
    segues to the three-minute organ/noise coda.  Very sensible.</p></div>"|683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/683-triptych/|7.3|Chris Dahlen

    shot on 16mm black-and-white film stock and featuring live
    show footage of bands largely from Washington, D.C. and/or
    Washington state. It likely features some live footage, arty,
    yet organic, camera work, and scenes of witty, articulate,
    attractively disheveled indie rockers self-consciously mugging
    at the camera and talking about touring. I say likely because,
    well, I haven't seen it. The film is currently ""on tour,"" and
    may be coming to your town soon. It won't be coming to mine,
    though; I live in rural North Carolina.  Thus, my options for
    catching the film are limited to my coughing up the price of
    a DVD (no thanks), or waiting for that friendly guy with the
    dog at Broadway Video to stock it. Am I disappointed? Not
    really. I mean, I nearly broke my neck trying to see the
    dismissable <i>Half-Cocked</i> way back in the day, only to
    learn that Rodan can't act. No surprises.</p><p>
    
    Also, I received (via first class mail), the soundtrack from
    <i>Songs for Cassavetes</i>, which does, in fact, feature
    fifteen or so primarily live tracks from bands like
    Sleater-Kinney, Dub Narcotic Sound System, and the Make-Up.
    Interspersed throughout are witty, articulate, self-conscious
    quips from people like Molly Neuman and Calvin Johnson about
    doing what you love and what happened to the underground in
    the 90s, which provide nice audio accompaniment to the
    black-and-white still frames on the cover and the earnest
    quotations from filmmaker Justin Mitchell in the liners.
    (Example: ""What follows is the kind of moment one never
    forgets. You know, the kind that ends up defining a part of
    your life and that you end up always trying to recapture. For
    the next ten minutes, you're someplace. It's pretty close to
    bliss and you know everyone else in the room feels the same
    thing."")</p><p>
    
    There's no denying the good intentions. And fortunately,
    <i>Songs for Cassavetes</i> largely avoids falling victim to
    the typical fate of good intentions. This isn't a sink-or-swim
    release. And I'd be willing to bet that if you buy this, you
    have a pretty good idea of what it'll sound like before you
    even get to the cash register. That, of course, may be a
    problem-- for a project dedicated to showcasing the innovation
    of the indie rock scene, there are few risks. I'm betting, for
    example, that even if you're not a fan, you've heard
    Sleater-Kinney's ""Words and Guitars,"" and I'll bet you have a
    pretty good idea of how that sounds live (raw, endearingly
    unskilled). Likewise, the live version of Unwound's ""Arboretum""
    makes a compelling argument for just how tight Unwound is, but
    doesn't build much on the LP version. The live recording format
    is even less effective for bands like the Make-Up and Dub
    Narcotic, whose on-stage success derives in part from the
    comparative performing charisma of their frontmen.</p><p>
    
    The lesser-knowns put up a good show. Further's ""I Am a
    Stranger"" is a great little garage-y, retro pop gem whose
    psychedelic leanings foreshadow certain bandmembers' futures
    in the Beachwood Sparks. Likewise, Chisel's (featuring the
    once and future Ted Leo) ""Spectacles,"" which according to
    liner apocrypha, served as partial genesis for the entire
    project, has something of a Jawbox feel.</p><p>
    
    I'm not so sure this soundtrack is strong enough to stand
    alone without knowledge of the film. The soundbytes from the
    interviews set a tone-- lots of DIY spirit-- and the John
    Cassavetes quotation that's attributed to ""Everyone"" provides
    some input as to the chosen title (I was darkly saddened to
    learn that it was not a collective answer to Le Tigre's
    ""What's Yr Take on Cassavetes?"").  But ultimately, all these
    bands have stronger material (excepting perhaps the Hi-Fives,
    whose fizzy, ingratiating ""You Can"" is the clear winner for
    low point on this CD).</p><p>
    
    Not a bad collection. But unsurprisingly: no surprises.</p></div>"|7877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7877-songs-for-cassavettes-sdtk/|6.5|Alison Fields

    bears an unfortunate physical resemblance to Richard Reid, a
    28-year-old shoe-bomber from London, England. Luckily, the
    resemblance ends with the face. For whereas Reid desires
    explosive death and destruction, Tellier only desires sleep.
    Or so it seems. Tellier's debut LP, <i>L'Incroyable Vérité</i>
    (on Air's new label, Record Makers) aims at sounding lonely.
    It attains its desired measure of solitude and, regrettably,
    much, much worse.</p><p>
    At first, I thought the opening track, ""Oh Malheur Chez O'Malley""
    was the theme music from ""Dr. Who."" This judgment, of course,
    was patently unfair and premature. Had I exercised patience, I
    would have realized that, in actuality, it was actually from
    ""Land of the Lost."" (""Say, Marshall, it's getting dark outside.
    We'd better get back before the-- fuck, no, not the <i>Sleestaks!!</i>).</p><p>
    Aside from not fully understanding what the hell a Sleestak
    was (the tall, greenish-yellow lizard men that populated the
    Land of the Lost), fear of them always seemed pitifully
    irrational to me. Yes, they bull-rushed Marshall, Will and
    Holly with nocturnal regularity, but can we be sure they
    intended harm? After all, Sleestaks weren't known for their
    leaping abilities or cat-like reflexes. Perhaps Sleestaks just
    liked to give hugs? Can anyone really be sure? Lucky for us,
    Tellier provides an answer to this stone age mystery towards
    the end of the album.</p><p>
    Sleestaks aside (for the moment), the point remains-- a good
    chunk of this Frenchman's first LP draws on the anachronistic
    hues of sci-fi television (and other 60s-70s era theme music,
    as on the frivolous ""Kazoo III"") including weird organ vamps
    and rudimentary synth arrangements. The rest of the album bucks
    the sci-fi thing in favor of arpeggiated acoustic guitar
    boredom, with ambient clinks and clatter in the background,
    and occasionally, humming or singing from the artist himself.
    Tellier sets the machine in motion, and it goes. And goes. And
    goes. Songs blend together like days in hell.</p><p>
    But back to the Staks: The album's high point comes when
    Tellier appears to answer the aforementioned mystery on
    ""Trilogie Femme,"" a largely somnolent solo-guitar tune, part
    of which is oddly reminiscent of the pitter-patter plucking
    sounds of Bugs Bunny walking on his tippy-toes.  But in this
    case, it's clearly not Bugs-- no, the mood is too dark and
    foreboding. These are the tones not of the animated thespian,
    but of the scaly doomsayer. Alas, a woman's chilling screams
    of horror conclude the tune, and the resolution becomes as
    clear as crystal gravy: she was killed by Sleestaks! Vicious,
    tip-toeing Sleestaks!  It happens.</p><p>
    But besides allowing me several glorious Sleestak references,
    <i>L'Incroyable Vérité</i> is nearly worthless. Good luck
    distinguishing lonely Tellier's candlelight drones from one
    another, and any other element of the powerful emotions he
    was supposedly aiming for.  <i>L'Incroyable Vérité</i> is
    virtually devoid of melody, climax, or even compelling
    orchestration, which usually can save slow, moody music like
    Tellier's.  And even though it's not quite as scary as
    man-eating prehistoric reptiles, <i>L'Incroyable Vérité</i>
    evokes about the same response: avoidance.</p></div>"|7966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7966-lincroyable-verite/|3.8|Brad Haywood

    Premium Cable Packages, rationalizing it as a vital and
    illuminating cultural window.  As I surfed around, hoping to
    find something that would truly justify my reasoning (aside
    from the 40+ cooking channels), I came across Mark Kitchell's
    Oscar-nominated documentary, <i>Berkeley in the Sixties</i>.
    Though the film explored a number of topics, its theme seemed
    to suggest that the counter-culture revolution of the 60s was
    prone to fail because it lacked a single coherent vision of
    what the post-revolutionary world should be comprised of.</p><p>
    
    Having no first-hand experience with the 60s, I instead drew
    parallels from my knowledge of the infinetly more profit-oriented
    Seattle-wave of the early 90s. Both were adorned with seemingly
    anti-commercial sentiments which were flagrantly touted and
    oft-professed, yet rarely put into action, and both seemed to
    coincide with a burgeoning musical movement. But by the 90s,
    artists were well aware of the price their insolence afforded
    them and the few who took up The Cause basically signed their
    own death warrants.</p><p>
    
    Subtly, advertising, commercialism, and all things
    counter-productive worked their way from the barroom to
    the concert hall and, finally, into your local indie venue.
    Eventually, most artists and clubs were perfectly willing to
    offer Coke the chance to equate their soda with an enjoyable
    social event for the right amount of funding. Luckily, as the
    old guard died away, a line of new blood was slowly
    consolidating their power; refusing to dilineate between
    music and politics.</p><p>
    
    A few years ago, Belle and Sebastian, perhaps better known as
    the thorn in the ass of the industry, took the high-minded
    ranting of Naomi Klein and Karl Marx to the next level and
    organized the ""Bowlie Weekender,"" an attempt to remedy the
    recent corporate transgresses while also avoiding the common
    pratfalls that seem to marr similar efforts. The ""Bowlie
    Weekender"" was a three-day festival held in Pontins, Camber
    Sands, Sussex, where performers of a similar ideology (such
    as Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Mogwai, the Pastels, the
    Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, and Sleater-Kinney) convened with
    their fans, free of advertisements, press, and all the
    trappings of a commercial event. When the festival was
    reprised in 2000, its name had been changed to ""All Tomorrow's
    Parties"" but the environs and intent remained the same.</p><p>
    
    2002 will see the marriage of Belle and Sebastian's brainchild
    with American sensibility as, for three days in March, Los
    Angeles will be the ironic home of ATP. Now, the orchestrators
    of that event have independently produced, compiled, and distributed
    an album featuring primarily rare and unreleased tracks from
    many of the artists who contributed to the festival. All said,
    there's something kinda beautiful about the whole thing.</p><p>
    
    The disc commences with Sonic Youth's ""Fauxhemians,"" a musical
    ode to fellow festival curators, Tortoise. Sonic Youth's
    decade-spanning knee-jerk reaction to <i>Daydream Nation</i>
    has left many heads good and scratched and, if you haven't
    given up on another <i>Dirty</i>, <i>Sister</i>, or <i>Evol</i>
    yet, accepting the truth is the first step on your road to
    recovery. The rest of us can sleep a little easier tonight,
    though, as ""Fauxhemians"" does what <i>NYC Ghosts and Flowers</i>
    failed to: go somewhere. Similarly, former-punks turned
    knob-twiddlers Unwound contribute the enthralling ""Behold the
    Salt,"" a testament to the emotional scope their music has come
    to encompass since ""Corpse Pose."" So far, there's nothing but
    an early morning breeze wafting throughout these tracks.</p><p>
    
    Stephen Malkmus makes an appearance with ""Good Kids Egg,""
    further cementing his reputation as a bottomless oasis of
    insightful wit. After ten years, his patented off-kilter voice
    can still pull off lines like, ""Do what the good kids do/ And
    screw who the good screw.../ A million of us came here with
    our pockets turned out."" Elsewhere, Cannibal Ox contributes
    ""Pidgeon"" off last year's excellent <i>The Cold Vein</i>.
    Such a diverse selection of styles generally gives rise to
    needless continuity complications, but in this instance, the
    dynamic created by the contrasting genres is what lends the
    album so much of its bent appeal.</p><p>
    
    Stereolab have performed at every ATP since its inception and
    they're represented here with ""Old Lungs"" which finds the
    band's more experimental side remarkably healthy (a relief to
    those who've longed for a return to the days of <i>Transient
    Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements</i>). Cat Power's cover
    of the Robert Johnson classic ""Come On in My Kitchen"" finds
    Chan Marshall's milky vocals breathing a sense of life into
    lyrics which have had some 80 years to decompose, and Papa M
    follows suit with the heart-wrenching ""How Can I Tell You I
    Love You?""</p><p>
    
    But to say that this disc is a sugary-sweet affair is to miss
    some of the album's most rewarding tracks. Early on, Bardo
    Pond indicate that all is not well in the world of ""demographic
    evasion"" as they indulge in dispensing poetry over a free
    arrangement of guitar, drums, and bass. But it's the latter
    half of the disc which features Dead C, the Boredoms, Kevin
    Drumm, and Satans Tornade unleashing an avant-noise maelstrom
    of epic proportions that truly makes the album worth owning.
    Dead C's sonic collage of dissonant mechanical noise, field
    recordings, abstract flourishes of percussion, and feedback
    on ""Load Segment"" are all coated with an ethereal reverb,
    slightly muting what would otherwise be a very confrontational
    track.</p><p>
    
    Yet, as the disarming ambience of ""Load Segment"" slowly
    dissolves, the Boredoms begin to interject the peace with
    shards of skeletal white-noise before establishing the chaotic
    tribal beat of ""Super Are,"" which sustains its incontinence
    for over ten minutes only to collapse into the crass and
    callous arms of Kevin Drumm's ""My Tree Bears No Nuts - Part 2.""
    Drumm (and likeminded composer, Satans Tornade) work like a
    more schizophrenic Merzbow, sharply cutting, layering, and
    varying the tone of their sonic exorcisms, daring the listener
    to find the hidden rhythm to their madness. All of this can
    make for a very intense, introspective assault, depending on
    the listener's level of participation.</p><p>
    
    There's a sense of nihilistic isolation permeating the surface
    of the songs compiled on <i>All Tomorrow's Parties v1.1</i>.
    Even the album's happiest moments are mired in feelings of
    regret or unrequited desire. As records go, it's far above-par
    and should provide you with hours of consolation and enjoyment.
    But if the disc is meant to act as a mission statement, its
    intended message seems to be: stick with Coke, man. You'll be
    a lot fucking happier.</p></div>"|1843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1843-all-tomorrows-parties-v11/|8.4|Kevin Adickes

    TIME: Martin Luther King Day. This Year.</p><p>
    
    AT RISE: Hapless Reviewer (female, about age twenty-six) sits at desk, drinking
    ill-advised coffee on mostly empty stomach, and quickly filling an ashtray. She
    stares helplessly at a computer screen and contemplates a pastel-hued CD cover.
    The sound of sentimental folk-pop plays softly in the background.</p><p>
    
    HAPLESS REVIEWER <i>(sighs, lights cigarette)</i>: Should a band be derided if
    their music appears in an episode of a heavily scorned teen drama on the WB?</p><p>
    
    HER CONSCIENCE <i>(enters from stage left, takes a seat in the broken yellow
    chair in the corner)</i>: This again?</p><p>
    
    HAPLESS REVIEWER: Yeah. So?</p><p>
    
    HER CONSCIENCE: No, they shouldn't. Otherwise decent bands have appeared on
    teen dramas before.  Remember when the Flaming Lips played on ""90210?""</p><p>
    
    HAPLESS REVIEWER: But what if appearing on a WB soundtrack is the band's single
    greatest-- though dubious-- claim to fame?</p><p>
    
    HER CONSCIENCE: Still, that's pretty harsh. <i>(Lights cigarette.)</i>
    Incidentally, how do you know that?</p><p>
    
    HAPLESS REVIEWER: I typed their name into a search engine and ""Dawson's Creek""
    showed up.</p><p>
    
    HER CONSCIENCE: Oh. Is it any good?</p><p>
    
    HAPLESS REVIEWER: I dunno. A little contrived. Hard to believe they really sound
    like that naturally-- the girl, in particular. I could see how it might be a
    guilty pleasure, and I'm guessing the fanbase is predominately female.  But
    personally, I think it's kind of boring, and a little too self-consciously
    precious for its own good.</p><p>
    
    HER CONSCIENCE: Are you talking about the show?</p><p>
    
    HAPLESS REVIEWER: Oh, god, no. The band!  Rilo Kiley.  From Los Angeles.</p><p>
    
    HER CONSCIENCE: How does it sound?</p><p>
    
    HAPLESS REVIEWER: Well, you can hear it for yourself. This is the first song, ""Go
    Ahead."" It has that airy, finger-picked folk thing going on. Pretty, I guess, but
    the most typical chord progression in the world.  And the girl-- Jenny Lewis--
    sings in that breathy, pouty little girl way favored by far too many female
    singer/songwriters these days. I hate that. She adds backing harmonies to give
    herself a little more substance, but it's hard to take someone seriously when
    they sing, ""If you wanna have your cake and eat it, too/ And if you want to have
    other people watch while you eat it/ Go ahead."" It's not quite campy enough to be
    twee.  Like, it's a tad more upbeat than Ida, but less interesting musically.</p><p>
    
    HER CONSCIENCE: That's not a compliment, is it?</p><p>
    
    HAPLESS REVIEWER: Not really, no. And I feel sort of bad pointing this out. Rilo
    Kiley is kind of a new band and all, but this sounds really amateurish. ""Pictures
    of Success"" could be a prom band doing Ida, with all the problems that implies.
    You know, the questionable sound quality, slightly out-of-tune instrumentation
    (including a completely irrelevant trumpet line at the end), over-articulated
    vocals, and an unnatural gentleness that makes you feel a little bit embarrassed.
    <i>(Pause)</i> Jenny Lewis' vocals really drive me crazy.</p><p>
    
    HER CONSCIENCE: Well, what about this other singer?</p><p>
    
    HAPLESS REVIEWER: Yeah, that's Blake Sennett. He sounds a lot like Elliott Smith,
    but not as good. Still, it's an improvement over the girl.  Otherwise, this song
    is fairly dismissable. You know how some bands can take the whole 60s lite-pop
    sound and subvert it to amusing and/or ironic effect?  Not these kids.  It's like
    Muzak!  The Beatles-esque business on ""Small Figures in a Vast Expanse"" isn't so
    bad, I guess-- I think the guitars sound better there than they usually do.  And
    I actually find that I don't mind Jenny Lewis' vocals so much when they're
    overdubbed as backing vocals.</p><p>
    
    HER CONSCIENCE: Have we heard this song before?</p><p>
    
    HAPLESS REVIEWER: No. It just sounds the same. Except track ten, ""Always."" It's
    not a bad song. I like the new wave intro. I like how over-the-top pop it is, and
    that it's comparatively loud. Reminds me of Velocity Girl, back in the day. And
    I'm inclined to believe this is the direction Rilo Kiley should take.  But still.</p><p>
    
    HER CONSCIENCE: You're going to make fun of them, aren't you?  For that ""Dawson's
    Creek"" business...
    
    HAPLESS REVIEWER: It's such a temptation.  It's not worth it, though.  I can't
    get a good dig in at Rilo Kiley because they're not bad enough to warrant my ire.
    I'm not offended, just bored. The worst thing I could say is that this is
    forgettable and any humor I may find in their connection to ""Dawson's Creek"" will
    do little more than remind me of who they are.</p></div>"|6787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6787-take-offs-and-landings/|4.0|Alison Fields

Time passes and ideas about things change, but the
    actual nature of things stays pretty much the same.  This is a phenomenon that,
    while never a popular train of thought among the super-hip and tuned-in, is
    almost always the final resting place for great thinkers and your grandparents
    alike.  And of course, there's a constant, subversive debate over whether or not
    this is really the case.  Some people will say that the idea of a static
    environment is contrary to the nature of culture and, in fact, nature itself.
    And then there's the issue of evolution, both theoretical and biological.  These
    are all heavy philosophical arguments, but if you just ask your grandparents,
    you'll find that, in actuality, nothing has changed, and if anything, the state
    of the world is regressing.</p><p>
    Now this debate becomes extra troublesome for us, the people who care about music
    above all other concerns, because often, the appearance of ""not changing"" is
    viewed negatively.  You need look no further than <i>Pitchfork</i>'s review
    archive to find that informed music thinkers often dismiss the new when it isn't.
    Chiefly, when an artist seems not to have advanced to the next square in the
    music game, the artist risks being accused of ""resting on his laurels,"" or worse,
    making the reviewer bored.  And as we all know, a bored music critic is a crime
    against nature.</p><p>
    I don't have a big problem with stuff staying the same, at least to a point. After
    all, if artists didn't go back to their roots (as if they had a choice), they'd
    never be able to build upon them.  England's Cylob (aka Chris Jeffs) is building
    on roots with <i>Mood Bells</i>.  To my ears, he's playing either ambient or new
    age music here, and though neither of those terms may leave the best of impressions
    on some listeners, they're certainly valid avenues of expression.  Yes, I think
    the music here could have come from the 70s, 80s or 90s, and perhaps that means
    it's not a revolutionary concept in art, but it's also not a real criticism in my
    opinion.  What will warrant criticism is dependent on your reaction to those roots--
    do you like new age?  So, with that out of the way, let's proceed with the album
    at hand.</p><p>
    ""Tamtam Intro"" begins the album with no hint of irony, as it's essentially a gong
    splash.  And that's it.  The next tune is ""Majorette,"" which is a meditative figure
    played on bells.  It's quite short (as are all the songs on <i>Mood Bells</i>),
    and features no embellishment or variation on the figure.  It's the kind of music
    that I would play as a soundtrack to staring, because there aren't any bumps in
    the road or rough transitions.  If that sounds like a compliment, then chances are
    you will like this record.  If not, stay tuned.</p><p>
    ""China Gong"" introduces a couple of new timbres, chiefly that of, well, a
    high-pitched Chinese gong (like you hear in Chinese opera), and some kind of
    metallic mallet instrument.  This isn't so much a song as a vignette of
    percussive textures.  ""Dark Days"" brings in a scalar melody, but keeps the
    instrumentation from the previous tune intact.  Sometimes the pitches shift
    up or down unnaturally, like you can do on keyboards with the little pitch-shifter
    handle, though apparently, they are honest-to-god bells, if a bit manipulated
    digitally.</p><p>
    ""Sun-day"" introduces more familiar synthlines, and perhaps wouldn't sound out of
    place on Björk's last album-- however, Björk would probably use this kind of thing
    for an intro, and then begin a proper song.  Again, Cylob's music on this album is
    more effective as disembodied ambience than active listening experience, so it's
    probably best not to go in expecting fireworks.</p><p>
    The only tune that features so much as a beat is ""Snowing,"" though it is suitably
    restrained.  Fans of Cylob's previous ambient techno stuff will probably enjoy
    this release, but then fans of Cylob's previous, more rambunctious material
    (especially stuff like 1997's <i>Cylob's Latest Effort</i> EP) may be put off by
    the sheer passiveness of the music.  I couldn't really call myself a fan of
    near-beatless ambient, per se, but by the same token, this disc did make a great
    companion to writing and just looking out of my window last weekend.</p></div>"|1705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1705-mood-bells/|7.0|Dominique Leone

    A lot of folks are, though, sometimes to an unfortunate extent-- hip-hop spends
    almost as much time drawing lines and fighting over its own image as the punk and
    hardcore zines do, albeit more entertainingly.  One of the results of this is that
    a whole lot of hip-hop records are basically about hip-hop: the mainstream stuff
    (aka ""real"" hip-hop) offers up further meta-explorations of a few MC-persona
    archetypes, while the undie stuff (aka ""real"" hip-hop) dedicates itself to the
    Ancient Skillz of crate-digging, battle rhyming, and either picking on the
    mainstream or spitting abstract jumbles of wordplay. The former is how we get
    stuff like P. Diddy saying, ""I don't write rhymes, I write checks""; the latter
    is how we get stuff like the Anti-Pop Consortium, who sound godlike in ten second
    snippets but prove mind-numbingly tedious by fifteen.</p><p>
    
    Aesop Rock is one of those MCs who have stumbled upon a blindingly intelligent
    solution to this state of affairs: he's ignored all of that baggage and made a
    record that's mostly about something.  That something is work.  Labor-- effort in
    its broadest sense-- is a topic he treats sometimes pedantically but often
    more thought-provokingly than not only the bulk of hip-hop, but the bulk of <i>any</i>
    genre. It helps that <i>Labor Days</i> is as terrific a record as anyone could
    ask for, really, and you should buy it, and here's why.</p><p>
    
    First: Aesop Rock is a terrific MC. His flow is rapid but clear; his interjections,
    double-time verses and sing-song bits are arranged with near-symphonic skill.
    He's also calm and confident, avoiding both the egomaniacal swagger of a lot of
    mainstream and the egomaniacal jerkiness of a lot of underground, while nicking
    their finer points as well. Better than that: Aesop Rock's flow is brilliant, a
    combination of mindbending wordplay (""Who am I?"" he asks, then answers:
    ""Jabberwocky Superfly!""), in-rhymed poetics (""You won't be laughing when the
    buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags""), and surgically sharp, eye-rolling
    dismissals of anyone he disapproves of: ""If you had one more eye you'd be a
    cyclops,"" runs one, ""which may explain your missing the premise."" Aesop Rock says
    more astoundingly intelligent things per minute than the entire combined rosters
    of a lot of other labels.</p><p>
    
    Second: Blockhead, who produces much of this record, does an equally terrific job.
    <i>Labor Days</i> is bound for constant comparisons to Cannibal Ox's <i>The Cold
    Vein</i>, the other Def Jux Edgy Intelligent NYC MCs with Stark Progressive Beats
    record to crop up on 2001's year-end lists.  And while the comparisons are valid
    ones, lyrically and often sonically, <i>Labor Days</i> differs by trading in
    <i>The Cold Vein</i>'s minimalist grind for an equally minimal but remarkably
    lush, cinematic spread of subtly weaving beats and sinuous, somber, minor-key
    instrumental arrangements that sound as if someone has been doing his
    crate-digging in the klezmer, bouzouki, and koto piles of the ""World Classical""
    section.</p><p>
    
    ""Daylight,"" the record's initial standout, works from a long, plush melodic loop
    with a wood flute sighing over it (there are a lot of woody flutes on this record--
    enough to make you wonder if Blockhead wouldn't have done a better job than RZA
    on the <i>Ghost Dog</i> soundtrack).  Meanwhile, ""Save Yourself,"" the record's
    <i>real</i> standout, consists of a slow-motion lope constructed from staccato bass
    blips, an east-Mediterranean guitar pluck, and wispy female cooing. ""Battery""
    stretches the limits of hip-hop pastoralism with a bass-and-cello figure and more
    of those fluttering coos with Ace intoning, ""Brother sun, sister moon, mother
    beautiful,"" and, ""I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids.""</p><p>
    
    If most hip-hop chases a futuristic, brightly lit city vitality, <i>Labor Days</i>
    is laid out peacefully on a rainy plain somewhere.  And if <i>The Cold Vein</i>
    sounds like the grind of inscrutable machinery, <i>Labor Days</i> waits a couple
    hundred years for those machines to be covered with moss and vines. When it all
    comes together, on ""9-5ers Anthem""-- a track which pairs a sprightly bassline
    with handbells (handbells!) with Ace in top form, spitting out brilliant parallel
    metaphors for quotidian employment-- it seems so all-consumingly <i>right</i>: hip-hop
    bouncing confidently along, actually saying something <i>about</i> something, and
    saying it well and smartly.</p><p>
    
    Aesop Rock <i>does</i> have a message here, which you'd expect to be a bad thing
    but isn't, really, insofar as the message is a pretty reasonable one. Ace's message
    is that life can be hard but that's all the more reason to shut your mouth and
    work on something that makes you happy. Essentially.  <i>Labor Days</i> gets
    cartoonish only once, on ""No Regrets,"" which is still a decent and sensitive
    track but which we won't really get into here because on the other hand, it's the
    inherent pragmatism of Ace's theme that allows for his wonderfully apologetic
    complaints about 9-5 employment.  Not to mention all those glorious eye-rolling
    disses: ""Keep me posted,"" he says, ""as to when you grasp something mature to sit
    and soak about, Mister, and I'll consider picking up your record.""</p><p>
    
    That last line's from ""Save Yourself,"" which collects Ace's comments on the How
    We Do Hip-Hop question-- he's undie, of course, here with his sonically
    progressive Def Jux release, so clearly he's going to drop some invective on
    this Important Issue. His take, though? Forget it: ""Maybe you ought to try saving
    something other than hip-hop,"" insightful advice no matter what genre you insert
    at the end. ""Pistons pump perfect,"" he says, then, ""what you're holding ain't
    really broken.""  And for the duration of <i>Labor Days</i>, it's pretty clear
    that in the hands of someone with something to <i>use</i> it for, it's not, not
    at all.</p></div>"|65.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/65-labor-days/|8.7|Nitsuh Abebe

In the much recounted story, Iggy was still
    a jazz nerd when he saw the Doors play at Michigan State's homecoming weekend
    dance.  Morrison, drunk and angry, berated the thicknecks while pouring his
    loudest, most annoying caterwauls over the din of his backing band.  Unfortunately,
    Iggy's Stooges didn't have the chops to cut their blues so mean, instead turning
    to the frantic diatribes of nonsense and noise that would become punk.</p><p>
    
    That early flirting with sensuality, Freud, and slightly hokey (if atmospheric)
    leanings towards magic still resonates across America, though it isn't so popular
    in the underground.  The music, like Morrison in his last days, is commonly
    referred to as ""bloated.""  It is therefore with some grace that Black Cat Music
    summon the bravado, free-associative linguistics, and raw confidence of the Doors.
    Granted, this is just one of many Doors references made in a sea of post-Doors
    reviews, but it's among the most overt with the shimmery, back-door blues pouring
    so effortlessly from these guys' hands.  From Berkeley, Black Cat Music includes
    members of the Criminals and the Receivers, and here, they reclaim the
    long-forgotten glam overtones first defined in Kim Fowley's version of west coast
    punk.</p><p>
    
    From the first moment Travis Dutton's guitar brands the songs as gin-fueled,
    metallic based grit, there's no pauncy apologies or ironic doublespeak-- just
    curl-ended phrases of instruments and vocals working at first in opposition,
    then in chorus.</p><p>
    
    Songs like ""The Chain-Snatcher"" borrow from the Gun Club's proto-hair
    pompousness in a way no east coast band ever could. ""Most Perfect Day, Ever""
    undercuts this with an acoustic rhythm track and subtle, double-tracked
    background vocals indicative not so much of radio production as that of a
    precise studio mind.  Still, the Svenonius-like swagger of singer Brady (no
    last name) takes on earnest, sometimes cliched sentimental properties without a
    hint of that disaffection so obvious in Nation of Ulysses or any of the new breed
    of political post-punkers. It's as if Black Cat Music, projecting the sonic
    nihilism of their ancestors, can't help but wake to the sunshine and expect it
    all to come out alright.</p><p>
    
    Black Cat Music's genuflection at the glam-gone-metal mindset, coupled with
    Brady's husky vocals, also manages to make room for lovely moments like ""The
    Dirty Penny,"" a song whose dark, Spanish turns recall Eric Burdon's Animals
    while standing firmly in the timeless world of slammin' solos and slick studios.
    That said, this isn't progress so much as a re-envisioning of history-- one where
    Morrison never sizzled out, where Iggy's gutter antics still smacked of glitter,
    and where the politics of the Threat and the Flag were just so much white kid,
    middle-class jive.</p></div>"|744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/744-hands-in-the-estuary-torso-in-the-lake/|8.3|Daphne Carr

When
    I find myself in front of a keyboard and I'm with people who can't play, it's
    fun to improvise a little melody on this foundation. I just do a walking bassline
    with my left hand and hit some random notes that fit with the chords with my
    right. If I play slowly, the little tune that spins out has an impressive
    melancholic quality, considering the complete lack of skill and talent that went
    into it.</p><p>
    Idyllictronic (Ryan, make that royalty check out to Simon Reynolds) bedroom
    producers Carpet Musics, consisting of Oregonians Eric Diaz and Eric Mast,
    realize the strength that comes from simplicity.  The 14 tracks on their debut,
    <i>Weekday</i>, are filled with these basic chord progressions, gently tapped
    on dreamy synthesizers and guitars set to ""ambient,"" with just a hint of
    distortion to reflect recent trends in glitch.  These tiny music box tunes are
    quite effective in their own modest way, and the record as a whole sustains a
    mood and is consistently enjoyable. Still, there's something just a bit too
    polite about <i>Weekday</i>, and the lack of tension keeps it from being great,
    or even particularly memorable.</p><p>
    No, it's definitely not Top 10 material, though there are certain situations
    where this record would be perfect. A gray day when your friends are out of town,
    you're just getting over the flu, and you're too broke to buy any new records
    would be the perfect time to hear ""Dawn,"" a track which reminds me of a
    stripped-down demo for Schneider TM's ""The Light 3000"" (sans vocals). The
    minute-long ""Bathrobe"" has a palpable sadness, not unlike some of the short
    transitional bits on Boards of Canada's <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i>.</p><p>
    ""Afternoon"" is a continuation of the earlier ""Noon,"" a track with fingerpicked
    electric guitar and some gurgling synths that transforms itself into a dystrophic
    (and adorable) techno rhythm about 2\xBD minutes in, reminiscent of Nobukazu
    Takemura's work as Child's View. It's an ideal track for relaxing on the couch
    as the sun fades away and you continue to wait for the mailman to bring that
    promised package of promo CDs. And ""Fashion Magazine,"" with its 4/4 house thump
    and a Cluster-ized melody ripped from the Schlammpeitziger fakebook, would set
    the mood for a shared cup of tea in a sunny kitchen, a respite to talk intimately
    about the latest Sonig releases.</p><p>
    There's not a thing wrong with functional music, and that's how this record
    strikes me. So while <i>Weekday</i> keeps me at arm's length emotionally, it
    works so well as background that it's worth keeping around.</p></div>"|1316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1316-weekday/|6.5|Mark Richard-San

By ""the scene,"" I mean music, and the people who love it.  Of
    course, one overarching scene doesn't really exist-- more correctly, there are
    hundreds of little scenes, each of which contributes its own part to a greater
    whole.  The most common scene demarcation, for obvious reasons, is geography.  A
    bunch of bands and their fans in one city become a scene over time, and in the
    right hands, it nurtures creativity and collaboration.</p><p>
    Of course, when you've got several regional scenes, rivalries begin to creep in
    over time.  These rivalries are usually nothing more than the imagined creations
    of a few fans or journalists, but on occasion, they spread to the business or
    (rarely) to the musicians themselves.  Apparently, the rivalry between the New
    York and Chicago scenes has become real enough that New York's Self-Starter
    Foundation makes a big deal over the fact that the Detachment Kit are a ""rare
    good band from Chicago"" on their website, regarding the band's signing.</p><p>
    Regardless of your opinion of the Chicago scene (which we here at <i>Pitchfork</i>
    most certainly do not have a problem with; as our readers are fond of noting,
    it's quite the opposite), it's hard to argue with the fact that the Detachment
    Kit sounds a lot more like a New York band than a Chicago one.  Their jerky, often
    melodic, and occasionally even anthemic post-punk would sound right at home coming
    off the stage at CBGB on a bill with some Rhode Island School of Design alumni.</p><p>
    In fact, the Detachment Kit frequently sound as though they could be Les Savy Fav's
    younger brothers playing in their own band on their debut, <i>They Raging. Quiet
    Army</i>.  Guitarist/vocalist Ian Menard comes across as something of a more
    melodic Tim Harrington, while the rest of the band has their way with all manner
    of rhythmic interplay.  However, the band manages to distance themselves enough
    from Les Savy Fav that their music doesn't begin to sound like pale imitation.
    On their own terms, the Detachment Kit are an agile band that show a great deal
    of promise.</p><p>
    The band doesn't really turn in a single bad song here, though a few stand
    especially tall above the crowd.  ""Yourself: A Majesty of Infinite Space""
    overflows with energy, opening with canonical screaming and launching headlong
    into frenzied guitar lines and syncopated drumming that pay tribute to yet
    another scene: D.C.  Menard's multi-tracked voice is reminiscent of a less
    demented sounding Guy Picciotto, spewing lines like, ""Now start the damage/ Start
    the sound.""  ""Hurricane Designed for People"" follows with stuttering verses and a
    kinetic sledgehammer of a chorus packed with piledriving bass and drums.</p><p>
    ""11.22.63"" typifies the Les Savy Fav comparison perhaps better than any other song
    on the album, with its slow start, building to the explosive screaming of the
    chorus, where Menard's similarity to Harrington is more obvious than ever.  Even
    the guitar tones bear a certain resemblance to LSF's ""Hide Me from Next February.""
    Guitarist Charlie Davis III is fond of playing snaking countermelodies and
    aggressive leads with his guitar covered in trebly distortion.  His leads on
    the opener, ""High Seas,"" are especially brash, full of huge note bends, and they
    cut through with slashing chords.</p><p>
    The band's own production gives the album a rather dry, direct feeling, which
    works well for the most part.  It especially suits the mathy guitar parts and
    remarkably restrained singing on ""Sitting Still, Talking About Jets,"" a song
    that could easily drown if treated to too much reverb.  Unfortunately, the song's
    linear structure leaves it a bit unsatisfying, as though there should have been
    another verse at the end.</p><p>
    ""The Euphio Question"" provides a nice contrast to the other songs with its
    relatively simple arrangement, slow pace, and e-bow guitar lines bordering on
    pretty.  The vocal melody isn't quite as strong, though, and Josh Hight's melodic
    bass part actually ends up stealing the show for most of the song.  ""Never Hear
    Your Words"" is even sparser, dispensing entirely with the muscular rhythmic
    backing that drives the rest of the album entirely at first, before building to
    a thunderous bridge.  Menard coats the whole song in a rich melody that proves
    one of his most compelling.</p><p>
    ""Another Great Champion Sought, Thought, and Died"" follows a similar formula,
    beginning with quietly creeping verses over a steady kick drum and droning bass.
    The intensity gradually builds and recedes as Menard alternates between melodic
    singing and agitated shouting.  Finally, the song bursts into processed hardcore
    shouting and stuttering, guttural guitar riffs at the 4\xBD-minute mark.  This
    raging climax ultimately gives out, though, leaving the song to end with a brief
    passage of quiet, clean-toned guitar and subtle bass strumming.</p><p>
    The album closes with ""The Illustrious Daniel Boone: Pioneer of Social Ingenuity,""
    which changes things up by crashing in noisily before calming for the verses.
    Davis' e-bow finds its way back into the mix as well, arcing about behind Menard
    in the first few verses before making its final exit.  The song unfortunately
    can't quite support itself for its full 6\xBD minutes, occasionally falling into
    listless passages that aren't convincing enough melodically or rhythmically.
    It's a fairly minor disappointment, though, coming at the end of an album with
    quite a few highlights.</p><p>
<i>They Raging. Quiet Army</i> is a strong debut when taken as a whole, though the
    band definitely has a little cleaning up to do here and there.  The Detachment Kit
    have proven that they have the range it takes to someday make a truly great record,
    and perhaps with another guiding hand, such as an outside producer, they should be
    able to do it soon.  For now, though, let's just say they've done their city proud
    and leave it at that.</p></div>"|2295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2295-they-raging-quiet-army/|7.1|Joe Tangari

    wonder why.  The Beatles became the biggest rock group in history, but their
    offspring-- from Big Star to XTC to the dB's-- barely touched the charts.  How
    can you not win with music so upbeat, accessible, and inventive?  Those hooks,
    those great guitar licks...</p><p>
    
    But it's important to remember that no band, no matter how good, has a birthright
    to stardom.  Guitar-heavy pop music hasn't gotten anybody laid since the sixties.
    You can dance to it, but you sure as hell can't neck to it.  The musicians aren't
    even sexy.  Look at the Beatles, and then pull out a photo of Big Star and try to
    pick ""the cute one.""  The bands hoped to conquer the school proms and teeny
    boppers, but Big Star's Alex Chilton later speculated on their true fanbase: ""I
    think it just sorta strikes a resonant chord with people who are in the same boat
    [as we were]-- you know, confused, twenty-year-old college students with a guitar
    in their hands.""  Would I rather hear these bands at the Super Bowl halftime show?
    Sure, but we're stuck with Aerosmith.  So it goes.</p><p>
    
    The dB's, an early-to-mid-80s southern jangle pop band from Winston-Salem via New
    York City, got more bad breaks than most.  Poor record sales kept them from
    building an audience.  The albums on this two-for-one reissue CD-- <i>Stands for
    deciBels</i> and <i>Repercussion</i>-- weren't even released in the States until
    after the band broke up.  dB Peter Holsapple has said that back when he worked at
    a record store, he steered customers to XTC and Squeeze albums because his own
    band's imports cost too much, proving once again that there is no karma in rock.</p><p>
    
    Yet, the band were always critical favorites, and played a major part in spawning
    the ""jangle-pop"" sound later perfected by R.E.M. and Mitch Easter's Let's Active.
    Atop their two-guitar line-up, the dB's experiment with keyboards and effects,
    firing rounds of world class hooks at fans' feet and daring them not to pogo.
    And all this while retaining such a distinct sound; unlike many guitar-pop bands
    of the time, the dB's preferred a live, unpolished sound to glossy 80s production.</p><p>
    
    While lead singers and songwriters Holsapple and Chris Stamey didn't exactly have
    the strongest voices, they knew how to wrap their vocals around a catchy line, and
    more importantly, how to sing about a girl like they meant it.  On <i>Stands for
    deciBels</i>, Holsapple writes the more straight-ahead tunes-- the flawless ""Big
    Brown Eyes,"" or the 50s-angst number ""The Fight.""  Stamey, meanwhile, contributes
    the quirky-almost-spastic numbers like ""Cycles Per Second,"" and scores the album's
    most heartfelt moment on ""I'm in Love"": his voice almost breaks as he belts out,
    ""I don't understand.""</p><p>
    
    On the cleaner-sounding, more mature <i>Repercussion</i>,
    Holsapple's songs are more dire, but they always manage to maintain catchiness--
    the album's single, ""Amplifier,"" famously discusses suicide with clever lyrics
    over an unwaveringly bouncy pop backing.  As Holsapple turned serious, Stamey
    delivered ridiculously catchy songs like ""Ask for Jill,"" where he reenacts being
    turned down via telephone.  <i>Repercussion</i> suggests a developing band and a
    terrific songwriting partnership.  But soon after, MTV rejected the video for
    ""Amplifier"" because of the suicide theme, Stamey quit the band, and more bad luck
    kept their next albums from doing much better than the first.</p><p>
    
    In interviews and the liner notes to this disc, the dB's sound resigned to their
    near-miss with success, and imagine if they had started out today: ""'kay guys,
    our research says the kids want Christian rock bands that don't actually talk
    about God.  How long can you grow your hair?""  But as I set this disc next to my
    other cult band reissues, I think about what Alex Chilton once said about his
    career: ""Somewhere along the line I figured out that if you only press up one
    hundred copies of a record, then eventually it will find its way to the one
    hundred people in the world who want it the most.""  Watching the dB's fans-- from
    the early college DJs who managed to find these albums, to the niche labels who
    reissue them today-- it's reassuring to find that Chilton was right.</p></div>"|11718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11718-stands-for-decibelsrepercussion/|9.0|Chris Dahlen

And your daddy was an alcoholic.  I've got
    something in my throat.  I need to be alone, when I suffer.  So wipe the makeup
    from your face, tie your hair and gently fall from grace.  Give me a call; when
    you're so sensitive, it's a long way to fall.  You fell from my view.  Son, you've
    got a way to fall.  Let me stay while they all fall to the ground.  There's an
    outlaw on the highway-- and she's falling.  And she's falling.</p><p>
    
    If it sounds like I've stumbled onto someone's LiveJournal account, it's because
    James Walsh's lyrics read like a diary.  And believe me, dear reader, when I tell
    you that each of the sentences above is from one of his songs.  Of the eleven
    tracks on <i>Love Is Here</i>, Starsailor's debut album, more than half mention
    the world ""fall"" in some tense.  Strange, too, because in interviews, Walsh has
    mentioned that the album title was chosen for its positivity, in the light of the
    cynicism they feel in the world around them.  Yet, there's no doubt that
    Starsailor's <i>Q</i>-mag accolades and their trip up the charts has been
    influenced by Coldplay, Travis and those other melancholy radiorock bands from
    their native England.</p><p>
    
    Walsh's voice, for his part, makes and breaks the band.  His wavering baritone
    doesn't sound much like a twenty-year-old, though it does bear an uncanny
    similarity at times to both Live's Ed Kowalcyzk and David Gray.  But his
    bandmates play foil to his ambition with the simplicity of their arrangements;
    James Stelfox's bass and Ben Byrne's drums create a vaguely soulful backbeat,
    and Barry Westhead's keyboards add ornamentation, swelling during the inevitably
    overblown climax of each song.  Producer Steve Osbourne should probably get
    credit as the fifth bandmember; his work with the Happy Mondays to Curve to Paul
    Oakenfold has given him the experience to craft a truly special sound here, lush
    and yet conveying an acoustic atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    If only Walsh &amp; Co. knew such subtlety.  The energy and emotion in these ballads
    comes across a hell of a lot more sincere than the Matchbox Twenties of the world,
    but Starsailor err so far on the opposite end that you're beaten about the ears.
    On the afore-referenced ""Alcoholic,"" Walsh whines, ""Don't you know you've got your
    daddy's eyes/ your daddy was an alcoholic/ But your mother kept it all inside/ And
    she threw it all away.""  The sharp piano chords mix with his voice like a long-lost
    Journey tear-jerker, and you know you can expect the entrance of the drums just
    as the second verse begins.  And Walsh's delivery, sounding so deliberate and
    forced, doesn't do the track any favors.</p><p>
    
    ""Tie Up My Hands,"" the opener, plods forward with soft bass and softer bass drum,
    and it's a nice enough lure.  But Walsh adopts this nursery-rhyme vocal hook:
    ""Take the disaffected life/ Men who ran the company ran your life/ You could have
    been his wife.""  He wants to be the tragic hero so bad, and the chorus blazes with
    dramatic guitarwork while he reels off: ""I wanna hold you but my hands are tied/ I
    wanna stay here but I've been denied!""  He is pretty hunky, I have to admit, but
    Bono's ego stole the same earnest rockstar pose long ago and forever doomed his
    followers to imitation.  Plus, you really can't forgive lyrics like, ""She just
    wept/ Like I could not ignore/ How can I act/ When my heart's on the floor?""  If
    Walsh didn't steal the scene so much, you might notice the other musicians'
    contributions more often.  The constant acoustic strum and piano progressions on
    ""Poor Misguided Fool"" near Tindersticks territory, and in the middle of ""Talk Her
    Down,"" the guys bust into this beautiful, churning wreck of a breakdown, keyboards
    swirling and cymbals crashing.</p><p>
<i>Love Is Here</i> isn't bad, and its prospect for radio play is far more
    appealing than, say, Train.  The four just don't have the depth of their admitted
    influences-- Neil Young, Van Morrison and Tim Buckley (the band is named after one
    of his albums)-- though they have much room for growth.  Most of the songs sound
    too similar: a brooding verse matched by a bombastic chorus, and Walsh's ""fall""
    imagery doesn't seem so much conceptual as it does repetitive.  Occasionally, as
    on the closer ""Coming Down,"" Walsh hushes his voice into intimacy as he asks,
    ""Were you always coming down?""  But usually it's the most blatant of dashboard
    confessionals: ""Daddy, I've got nothing left/ My life is good/ My love's a mess.""</p><p>
    
    People get onto indie rock for being inaccessible, but I'll take Pavement's
    ""latent causes, sterile gauzes and the bedside morale"" any day over Starsailor's
    ""there's a hole inside my boat, and I need to stay afloat, for the summer.""
    Maybe Starsailor will hit it big here in the post-September-11th U.S., as they
    did in the U.K.; they've got that whiny doleful sensitivity that appeals to the
    masses.  But I don't get the cathartic release they're aiming for.  Instead, I
    just feel like falling.</p></div>"|7479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7479-love-is-here/|5.7|Christopher Dare

Dade, the former bassist for the early 90s
    alternative rock band the Soup Dragons, so it isn't surprising in the least
    that he would want to distance himself from his past.  Remarkably, he's done a
    pretty good job of it with this project.  1999's <i>A Galaxy of Sound</i>
    featured an inspired crew of collaborators, including the Pastels, the Red
    Krayola, Bill Wells, and Kim Fowley, among others.  But the new record, <i>Tiny
    Waves, Mighty Sea</i>, is less of an intercontinental flight than Future Pilot's
    maiden voyage.</p><p>
<i>Tiny Waves</i> shares its predecessor's collaborate-or-die inclination, but
    this time, Dade invites musicians closer to his Scottish home.  This means I miss
    a second chance to hear him mixing it up with Suicide's Alan Vega and Andy
    Weatherall of Two Lone Swordsmen.  And I really miss not hearing another Dade
    composition featuring ex-Fall girl Brix Smith.  In these artists' stead, Dade
    has corralled members of Belle and Sebastian, the Pastels (again), Superstar,
    the Delgados, Teenage Fanclub, and, erm, James.  For three days, Dade frolicked
    around with the Scottish indie elite, resulting in a soothing pastoral album that
    more than whiffs of positive love vibes and patchouli. George Harrison would have
    loved it.</p><p>
    
    Like <i>A Galaxy of Sound</i>, <i>Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea</i> doesn't conceal
    Dade's Indian heritage. But unlike members of the Anglo-Asian underground, Dade
    doesn't drop in clanging signifiers such as sputtering tabla runs, sitar jams,
    or acrobatic vocal melismatics. In fact, Belle and Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch
    sings the album's most overtly Indian song, ""Om Namah Shivaya.""  Dade thereby
    neatly sidesteps stereotype and at the same time fully expresses the nationless,
    raceless universality of the mantra that literally means, ""I bow to Shiva,"" Shiva
    being the supreme reality of your inner self. Perhaps some purists will criticize
    Dade for relocating Indian devotional music in such an unorthodox setting, but to
    me, Dade's musical accompaniment to this ten-minute swelling and receding acoustic
    waltz reinforces his insistence of the universality of the chant.</p><p>
<i>Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea</i> doesn't open with such grand intentions. ""Maid of
    the Loch"" is a dreamy, slightly familiar instrumental that introduces the tranquil
    musical themes Dade expands upon over the album's thirteen tracks. Amidst
    glockenspiel chimes and background vocals from the Pastels' Katrina Mitchell,
    Isobel Campbell lends her indie-baby whisper to the almost nursery rhyme-like
    traditional hymn ""Ananda Is the Ocean."" Superstar's Joe McAlinden and Jim
    McColloch harmonize with each other during the roiling cover of Jim Pepper's
    Native American-influenced jazz-pop crossover hit ""Witchi Tai To."" And after
    another traditional ballad, ""Darshan,"" Julia Smith sings ""Beautiful Dreamer.""</p><p>
    
    96-year-old Julia Smith met Dade while he was working for Alzheimer's Scotland.
    Written by nineteenth-century balladeer Stephen Foster, ""Beautiful Dreamer"" is
    less known than Foster's most famous songs, ""Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair,""
    ""Swanee River,"" and ""Camptown Races.""  Smith's performance is, of course, fragile.
    But as she sings, you can hear the rush of a youthful past fondly remembered.
    It's as moving a performance as ""Voices of Old People,"" the dialog-collage Simon
    and Garfunkel included on <i>Bookends</i>.</p><p>
    
    For the devotional ""Shree Ram, Jai Ram,"" Dade wraps the chanted vocals of his wife,
    Vinita, in glockenspiel tinkles, ground bass notes, and Ralph MacDonald's jittering
    saxophone. Stephen Pastel contributes a tremolo guitar and electronic treatments
    to the lullaby ""Opel Waters."" Norman Blake steps up to the vocal mike for ""Beat
    of a Drum,"" which is, predictably, the most poppy and upbeat track here. Lyrically,
    ""Beat of a Drum"" is nothing spectacular, a message song about the healing
    properties of music. Dade needn't resort to the hamfisted language of pop
    psychology to make his point.  The other tracks on this album far more powerfully
    convey Dade's message than the lyrics Blake gamely and obligingly sings.</p><p>
    
    After Stuart Murdoch's meditative highlight, <i>Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea</i> returns
    to Earth with MacDonald's tenor sax crying a Coltrane blues amid multiple reverbed
    guitars and Bill Wells' Wurlitizer. Once the feedback screeches have faded, the
    album closes, in appropriate blissfulness, with Vinita Dade's unaccompanied
    ""Prayer for Ananda.""</p><p>
    
    Just as <i>A Galaxy of Sound</i> showcased Dade's experimental side, <i>Tiny Waves,
    Mighty Sea</i> bountifully displays Dade's tenderness and spirituality. A fusion
    of these two sides of Dade's artistry would make for an album greater than the
    sum of its parts, and far hipper than the cred of Dade's collaborators.  For now,
    <i>Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea</i> will tide me over well enough.</p></div>"|3254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3254-tiny-waves-mighty-sea/|6.8|Paul Cooper

Not in a starstuck sort
    of way; like when you find yourself catching a peripheral glance of an icon at
    the center seat of an entourage table in the sort of place that probably shouldn't
    have even admitted you, and while you mull over possible comments or questions,
    you totter on your poor choice of last season's footwear and spill your beer all
    over the table's most belligerent member.</p><p>
    
    Not that this has happened to me.</p><p>
    
    The intimidation factor on Sarah Dougher arises out of a sense that, from what
    I've read, she's a woman who has her shit together: she's a professor of writing
    and classical mythology (among other things), the author of books on racism and
    railroad building, an ex-member of bands like the Lookers, the Crabs and
    Cadallaca, and a solo artist with, as of right now, a third solo album under her
    belt.  Her latest, <i>The Bluff</i> caused me to throw open my car doors, sit on
    the hood, and enjoy the freezing cold of the Blue Ridge Parkway, soundtracked by
    title song on repeat.</p><p>
    
    To describe this as an album consisting primarily of subtle, pretty songs about
    relationships (though, technically, it is) risks pigeonholing it as another
    candidate in an increasingly forgettable list of female singer/songwriters.  A
    conspicuous thread of 60s psychedelic rock runs through the up-tempo tracks on
    the first part of the album. The best of these, ""Must Believe,"" features Dougher's
    swirling organ work, and a <i>Nuggets</i>-era minor key guitar line. The lyrics
    are simple enough, but when Dougher sings, ""When you hold me in your arms, I must
    believe it's true,"" the manifest sense of desperation (helped by Corin Tucker's
    banshee backing vocals) elevates the overall sense to something more than
    retro-pop. Likewise, ""Keep Me"" features a borderline surf-rock guitar line, and
    deceivingly straightforward lyrics in the verses, while walking the fine line
    between rage and regret in the choruses: ""You ask me in and then treat me like an
    uninvited whore/ Don't throw it away/ Nothing beautiful stays.""</p><p>
    
    The second half of the album flirts with a wider variety of influences, and
    within these, Dougher has some really spectacular moments-- the spare drum machine
    bossa nova of ""System Works"" resolves itself into a wailing, crunchy chorus. It's
    a juxtaposition that works, and one of the most unusual songs on the album. Others
    are less successful. The politely folky ""My Kingdom"" is pretty but predictable,
    and you'll swear you've heard the spare, major key blues on ""Fall Down"" before.
    The meditative organ ballad, ""The Choice,"" has a nice resonance to it, but feels
    druggy and plodding after the album's first half. Say what you like about
    complaints concerning the track sequence, but it seems to me, the excellent,
    affecting cover of Allen Toussaint's 1962 piano blues, ""It's Raining,"" would have
    been a better candidate for album closer.</p><p>
    
    This is an easy album to digest, cleaner, more cautious, and less raw than
    Dougher's previous, <i>The Walls Ablaze</i>. The edge primarily exists in the
    contrast between Dougher's earthy, plaintive vocal quality and the tidy lines in
    the songs. Greater pains have been taken to blur the rawness around the edges.
    I've always suspected Sarah Dougher is the kind of performer who's constantly
    engaged in an internal dialogue with her own impulses, as if her more explosive
    inclinations are tempered by a kind of cautious restraint-- both instrumentally
    and vocally. She never surrenders herself wholly to a particular persona-- neither
    spunky, petulant rocker, nor melancholic storyteller. And some of the best moments
    occur when these internal arguments reveal themselves within the body of songs.
    Like midway through the elegant, enigmatic title track, when, hanging over a
    precipice of building guitars, Dougher suddenly pulls back and resolves into
    sweet and cautious. It works.</p><p>
    
    The bluff.</p><p>
    
    Yeah, I get it.</p></div>"|2428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2428-the-bluff/|7.4|Alison Fields

    Really, really long compositions.  <i>Piano and String Quartet</i> and <i>For
    Bunita Marcus</i> each fill an eighty minute CD; <i>For Christian Wolff</i>
    runs around three hours; <i>For Philip Guston</i> clocks in at over four. Each
    piece is monolithic, with no interruptions and no movements or other divisions.</p><p>
    The mother of them all, however, is his until-now unrecorded <i>String Quartet
    II</i>. Hat Hut's hat[now]ART imprint just released the first recording, performed
    by members of the Ives Ensemble for a duration of almost five hours. First
    performed by the Kronos Quartet, the piece runs anywhere between four and
    (allegedly) six hours, with few rests and no interruptions. Kronos performed it
    live several times and never recorded it: they cancelled their scheduled final
    performance for health reasons. David Harrington, violinist and Kronos' artistic
    director, said in an interview for the NEA: ""<i>The Second Quartet</i> is
    physically so demanding... I think marathon runners must go through the same
    thing we do when we play <i>The Second Quartet</i>... you go in and out of feeling
    your body is going to break. Even right now when I'm thinking of <i>The Second
    Quartet</i> I have a shooting pain in my back.""</p><p>
    Feldman fans have been waiting for a recording of <i>String Quartet II</i> since
    Feldman wrote it eighteen years ago. Even if the Ives Ensemble blew it, this
    record would be a milestone.  As it happens, this is a terrific performance of a
    fascinating work that rewards all the time you can give it.</p><p>
    Anyone who hasn't heard a Feldman piece may wonder how the time passes. The short
    answer is that it doesn't. One of Feldman's agendas was to turn time into space:
    to make time feel not like a line, but like a landscape that the listener has
    dropped into. The pieces hardly begin and don't seem to end. He uses only a few
    themes, but as he repeats a phrase or motif, he alters it by changing the time
    signature or the dynamics in subtle but discernable ways. Rather than repetitive,
    the simplest elements become engrossing. With that construction, the size of the
    works gives them mass. During <i>For Philip Guston</i>, a phrase may slowly repeat
    until it's heavy and unmovable, like a boulder settling on the floor of the ocean.
    This superficially sounds like a ""deep listening"" exercise, but unlike ambient
    music, there's no slack: Feldman's excruciating detail and strict control make
    the works mentally engaging, refusing to allow a passive audience. It doesn't
    become the background; it becomes the air you're breathing.</p><p>
    Though it's his longest, <i>String Quartet II</i> is one of Feldman's most dynamic
    and aggressive works. The strings jump between themes, play occasional flurries of
    notes, and produce a more grinding and aggressive sound than on, say, the serene
    and austere <i>Piano and String Quartet</i>. In the first 2\xBD hours the music
    ranges from barely audible to enraged. A set of themes is reworked and revisited;
    they're so short that they seem more like gestures, until you've heard them so
    many times that they become melodies. Progress is only experienced measure by
    measure before the piece changes direction again. By the third disc it calms down:
    sections last longer and sound more subdued, and some of them are outright pretty.
    Feldman even throws in a brief pizzicato cello part that's almost funky. The last
    disc doesn't offer a sharp ending. There's a slow trailing off that again suggests
    it's not done; we're just leaving it behind.</p><p>
    Having never heard the piece in concert, I can't compare this debut recording to
    any other performance. The Ives Ensemble's playing is just short of academic, but
    appropriate for this piece. Feldman specifies many tonal colors that the musicians
    go to pains to reproduce accurately and engagingly. And they don't show the fatigue
    you might expect at the end-- they've performed this in concert a few times, and
    may be ""in shape,"" but I'm also not sure how (or in how many pieces) they recorded
    it.</p><p>
    Hat[now]ART published <i>String Quartet II</i> in an edition of only 3,000 copies,
    which is like locking people out of museums (but which might meet demand). That's
    unfortunate: Feldman is essential listening. New listeners might start with
    shorter works, like Kronos' <i>Piano and String Quartet</i> or the New Albion
    edition of <i>Rothko Chapel</i>, but everyone should have a chance to confront
    this thing at least once.</p></div>"|3026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3026-string-quartet-ii/|9.5|Chris Dahlen

    long shot. But in an ode to the capitalist spirit of efficiency, New Yorkers have
    accomplished a stunning feat of people-packing; while Canadians bogart a whopping
    3.8 million square miles of the continent, New Yorkers shoehorn themselves into a
    mere 320.  That's 25,000 New Yorkers per square mile versus a lonely 8 per square
    mile in the Great White North. For New Yorkers, this means doubling-up, living in
    closets, and moving to Hoboken. For Canadians, it means just the opposite:
    solitude.  And a plethora of moose (one of which stars on Hayden's album cover).</p><p>
    
    Canadian Hayden Desser's sounds of solitude have captured the ears of sad-core
    indie-folk fans ever since his debut LP, <i>Everything I Long For</i>, was
    released in 1996. The album, recorded on a four-track at his parent's house, was
    notable for its contrast of wistful tenderness and snarling anger, and of course,
    Hayden's striking baritone. On its follow-up, <i>The Closer I Get</i>, Hayden had
    less to growl about, but just as much to long for, finding its high points with
    ""Two Doors"" and ""Between Us to Hold.""</p><p>
    
    Now, after a three-year hiatus, Hayden has returned with his third LP, <i>Skyscraper
    National Park</i>.  The album casts Hayden as older, wiser and more reflective.
    Hayden is still a man steeped in his own sensitivity, but he's changed a bit with
    age.  Youthful, idealistic romance has grown into love, hopefulness into doubt,
    and anger into distance.  Accompanying his maturity is a newfound and uncanny
    sense of restraint that both binds the disc and renders his passion haunting and
    compelling. Not once does Hayden burst into a growl. Instead, the album is marked
    by frequent reliance on a simple falsetto.</p><p>
    
    Hayden's progression is apparent from the opening chords of ""Street Car,"" faint
    and filtered, with audible squeaks and shimmers of Hayden's fingers on the
    fretboard of his 12-string.  A piano joins only on downbeats, and both play an
    ideal forum for Hayden's forlorn lyrics: ""Parked underground the night you left/
    It took me an hour and a half/ To find my way back up above/ There's nothing up
    there without your love.""</p><p>
    
    ""Dynamite Walls"" is as close Hayden has come to perfecting his craft.  The song
    features an uptempo beat (for Hayden) and a full band, dwelling on fresh, spacious
    instrumentation and a subdued melody, until it releases into a magnificent
    crescendo. The lyrics, including the chorus (""Miles away, just up ahead/ It
    doesn't matter just what/ Any of us is looking for/ We'll never find it because/
    It's not even there"") are a shockingly precise complement to the music, conjuring
    images of driving through open spaces and mountain air. After ""Dynamite Walls,""
    <i>Skyscraper National Park</i> levels into a sonic consistency of subdued
    melodies and sparse instrumentation.</p><p>
    
    ""All in One Move"" is one of cheeriest tunes on the album, so much so that it can
    properly be called a ""tune."" Not surprisingly for sad-man Hayden, at about one
    minute in length, it's also the shortest song on the disc. So before he manages
    to lift himself out of depression, he regresses into ""Bass Song,"" featuring lyrics
    as genial and optimistic as, ""I couldn't find shit/ So I grabbed my bass guitar by
    the neck/ And held it above me/ And hid by the top of the stairs and that's where
    I was found/ Five days after I hit the ground.""</p><p>
    
    Hayden closes the album nicely with ""Lullaby,"" less melody-focused than the rest
    of the album, and more akin to the mood music of such slow-core stalwarts as Low
    and Idaho. On it, Hayden beckons his beloved to ""close your eyes and think about/
    What you can't live without."" The invitation is as appropriate to the listener as
    to his lover. It is what it says-- a lullaby-- fading peacefully into sleep.</p><p>
    
    Although its best moments don't reach quite the altitudes of his prior releases,
    <i>Skyscraper National Park</i>, as a whole, is the most complete and coherent
    album in Hayden's catalog, a delightful listen from track one through track eleven.
    The union of his established songwriting talent with his poignant maturity and
    restraint make <i>Skyscraper National Park</i> convincing, powerful, and well
    worth purchasing.</p></div>"|3772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3772-skyscraper-national-park/|8.2|Brad Haywood

Back then, pretty much
    everyone had written off the Charlatans as also-rans-- their early offerings just
    didn't match up to the mighty Stone Roses or Happy Mondays.  Thankfully for us,
    the Charlatans were undaunted by their own press, and by now they've outlived
    every other band of that all-but-forgotten early 90s movement.  And anyone
    checking out the UK charts could tell you that they've definitely had the last
    laugh, despite the tragedies and calamities that have delayed them on their way
    into the vanguard of prominent UK rock acts.</p><p>
    
    It seems somewhat fitting that the band's seventh album, coming just over ten
    years after their debut, should find them re-exploring some of the dance-rock
    fusion that carried their first efforts.  Their last album, 1999's <i>Us &amp; Us
    Only</i>, found them more squarely in trad-rock territory than ever before,
    bathing in ominous analog synths and searching for answers.  The change probably
    stemmed a great deal from the fact that it was the band's first album written in
    the wake of original keyboardist Rob Collins' death in a car accident.</p><p>
<i>Wonderland</i> takes the sound of that last album and pumps it full of the
    energy that dripped from the band's previous releases, resulting in a record that
    can oddly be both fragile, danceable, and anthemic all at the same time.  Let's
    put it this way: if this album had been released in 1992, it would almost certainly
    have been held up as a future classic.  A decade later, it simply sounds damn
    good.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the biggest difference in the band's sound on <i>Wonderland</i> is in Tim
    Burgess' voice.  He adopts a previously unknown falsetto on several of the songs
    here, and though it's not as strong as his usual singing voice, it works
    surprisingly well in most places.  Case in point is the first single, ""Love Is
    the Key,"" a catchy R&amp;B-influenced; tune replete with female backing singers.
    Drummer John Brookes and bassist Martin Blunt drive the song hard, but it's Tony
    Rogers' funky organ comping and Rhodes lines that really elevate it.  Rogers has
    done remarkably well for himself trying to fill Rob Collins' sizable shoes since
    joining the band, and here he continues to assert himself as the Charlatans'
    guiding musical force.</p><p>
    
    Nearly as obvious a choice for a single is ""I Just Can't Get Over Losing You,""
    which creeps in slowly before kicking into another one of the band's infectious
    grooves.  Burgess exhorts you to get down, and it's pretty likely that you won't
    have any problem complying.  Guitarist Mark Collins weaves dozens of little
    stuttering passages through the mix, vying with Rogers for control of the harmonic
    and countermelodic space.  This is followed by the instrumental ""The Bell and the
    Butterfly,"" a four-minute bass- and drum-dominated rave-up that opens with a
    bombastic, fuzzed-out bass riff, then completely recontextualizes the riff with
    programmed, almost junglist beats.  Brookes joins the programmed percussion on
    his kit as Blunt briefly reprises the bassline from ""Love Is the Key"" before
    launching off on an impressive lead tangent.</p><p>
    
    Tracks like ""The Bell and the Butterfly"" are one of the reasons I love the
    Charlatans as much as I do.  In an era when it's cool for rock bands to be ashamed
    of being rock bands, the Charlatans aren't.  No matter how much programming they
    incorporate or how many other elements color their sound, they're a rock band at
    heart, unafraid to rock out just for the sake of it.  And there's plenty of subtle
    programming to be found on <i>Wonderland</i>-- little artificial hi-hat flourishes
    color the edges of the beat in ""And If I Fall,"" which just might contain one of
    the best choruses the band has ever written.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""A Man Needs to Be Told"" most closely resembles <i>Us &amp; Us Only</i>'s
    rootsy vibe, employing none other than Daniel Lanois on the pedal steel.  It's
    amazing how well the faux-country sound suits the band.  Burgess' falsetto feels
    more at home surrounded by the keening guitars and extra percussion (provided by
    Jim Keltner, who's played with absolutely everybody, including Bob Dylan, Elvis
    Costello, Ry Cooder, George Harrison, and John Lennon).  ""Wake Up"" runs in a
    slightly similar vein, breaking into a melodic ballad after a guitar intro that
    you could pretty easily mistake for a mid-80s King Crimson track.  Soon afterward,
    though, the guitar is dripping in Leslie and wah pedals.  Burgess presides over
    the song with some uncharacteristically aggressive lyrics, including the catchy
    couplet, ""Sayin' something, saying nothing/ You'll be a little quieter with a
    gun in your mouth.""</p><p>
    
    This is followed by the mellotron- and piano-drenched ""Is It in You?,"" which,
    for all its gripping atmosphere, is one of the few songs on the album that
    doesn't really hang onto your ear after grabbing it.  The closing ""Ballad of the
    Band"" doesn't really do much to lift things, either, and the album unfortunately
    ends on a somewhat lackluster note.</p><p>
    
    Regardless of the ending, though, the Charlatans have managed to release yet
    another immensely satisfying album.  The deft synthesis of all of the band's past
    incarnations speaks to the fact that their best work may indeed lie ahead of them.
    If you're looking for a starting place for the Charlatans, I'd probably recommend
    <i>Tellin' Stories</i> or <i>Us &amp; Us Only</i> first, but <i>Wonderland</i> is a
    worthy entry from one of Britain's most underappreciated bands.</p></div>"|1401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1401-wonderland/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    I've primed my fingers to write something cute or creative.  Nothing has come.
    Sorry About Dresden has me stumped. Their music is so uninspiring, it's jolted
    me into writer's block.  Let's just get this over with.</p><p>
    
    Sorry About Dresden (SAD) is a five-piece ensemble from North Carolina that
    specializes in guitar-heavy indie rock. The music definitely has more mainstream
    appeal than your average hipster geeks. The focus is on the songwriting, a blend
    of pop melodies and growling relationship angst. Songs frequently end with
    choruses repeated as a mantra, with vocalist Matt Oberst (yes, of the notorious
    Oberst clan) progressively gaining more passion.</p><p>
    
    When Oberst wants you to feel his pain, it's a little too obvious-- usually
    delivered high and hard, at the top of his range.  If I had to peg his voice,
    I'd say it's a cross of Dave Pirner and Elvis Costello, replete with faux British
    accent. I've said this numerous times before, but I will repeat it here: there is,
    unequivocally, no point to this record.  Be proud of your home Tarheel State,
    Matt.</p><p>
    
    If I were in the mood for conspiracy theories, I'd also complain about the
    sequencing of the tracks. Just for kicks, picture <i>The Convenience of
    Indecision</i> as a mathematical function. If the album could be graphed, it
    would start fairly high, at around the 7 or 8 range (the opening track, ""A
    Losing Season"") and regress downwards with a slope of negative one, until it
    reaches ""0"" with the unimaginative throwaway closer, ""A Reunion of Sorts."" To
    put it another way, it's a top heavy album; everything worth listening to is in
    the first four tracks. It seems like a ruse to con music store listeners into
    purchasing an LP with the substance of an EP. Maybe they should title the disc,
    <i>The Convenience of Capitalizing on In-Store Listening-Kiosk Impatience</i>.
    Or not.  But honesty would be nice.</p><p>
    
    Cutting to the chase, <i>The Convenience of Indecision</i> is nondescript,
    semi-indie rock with little to grab a hold of.  Sorry about the writer's block,
    but Sorry About Dresden will do that to you.</p></div>"|7360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7360-the-convenience-of-indecision/|5.7|Brad Haywood

It's the fate of simply being yourself.  Such is the story
    of Jonathan Richman.  Jonathan's the type of guy who'd have serenaded the head
    cheerleader at two a.m. in a mariachi outfit, and done it straight-faced with
    complete sincerity.  She'd have been creeped out, and Jonathan would've inevitably
    been beaten bloody by her boyfriend, but once he wised up and turned his attention
    to the girls that are truly feverish for romance-- those geeky girls with
    Harlequins tucked under their mattresses-- they'd swoon to his unabashedly
    heartfelt and naïve yearning.  Of course, such romanticism is cloying when taken
    seriously, but Richman always conveys-- however subtly-- that his tongue's
    in-cheek.</p><p>
    Richman's not a newcomer to the music scene by any stretch of the imagination.
    Including the couple of albums he cut with the seminal proto-punk band the Modern
    Lovers, <i>Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow</i> represents his 19th
    full-length release.  Despite recording one of the most prescient albums in rock
    history and his prolific catalog, Richman is still a pretty obscure artist with
    a small following.  But even if you've never heard the name Jonathan Richman,
    chances are you're more familiar with him than you think, largely due to his
    cameos in <i>There's Something About Mary</i>.  Yes, that was him.  And his little
    segues actually manage to give a pretty good general impression of <i>Her Mystery
    Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow</i>.</p><p>
    The seeds of Richman's current sound were all sewn in the winsome 1950s: sparse
    rockabilly and doo-wop arrangements filled with conventional romantic truisms,
    but also sharpened with an understated wit; there are even some awkward ventures
    into Latin forms like the bolero, meringue and the samba, as stiff and amusing as
    a gringo learning to salsa.  It's all lightweight stuff, but that's where its
    charm lies.</p><p>
<i>Her Mystery</i> is full of the mawkish sentimentality of young love, naïve
    sexuality and the stirrings of spring: ""On Canal Street in April
    when it's 60 and the snow is melting fast/ It's still shady in the morning when
    you're laughing in your t-shirt running past/ In Tompkins Square Park a couple is
    meeting/ Say what you want, but I feel my heart beating/ Because I love springtime
    in New York, springtime in New York, I do."" ""From Springtime in New York"" sums up
    the wide-eyed, Gump-like unaffectedness of the songs here; the album contains
    about as many illicit thoughts as a eunuch in a harem.</p><p>
    Later, on the same track, he sings: ""On 1st Avenue, a couple is breakin' up/
    Eviction, too, they must be shaken up/ But I love springtime in New York.""  It's
    lines like these that give the album its clever, off-kilter orientation.  Nothing
    seems to bring this guy down; I don't think there's an ounce of cortisol in his
    system.  Even conflict is viewed as naturally as a morning shit in songs like
    ""Couples Must Fight"": ""My heart knows pain, my heart knows sorrow/ My heart knows
    wrongs that could never make right/ But for a better day tomorrow, couples must
    argue, couples must fight.""  A five year old couldn't state it more simply.</p><p>
    I don't know how well Richman knows his Spanish, but the last four songs are sung
    exclusively <i>en Español</i>, as eagerly as a student looking for extra credit.
    He reminded me of David Byrne toying with these Latin rhythms-- the voices are
    even quite similar, and there seems to be a strain of Trio Los Panchos influence
    winding its way through the album with the intricate guitar picking that opens
    some of the tracks.</p><p>
    For the most part, the songs are stripped to the bare
    minimum: acoustic guitar, bass and a minimal drum kit, often played with a brush.
    There's an appearance from what sounds like a bass clarinet on ""I Took a Chance""
    and the title track, and there's some additional percussion to spice things up on
    the Latin numbers, but that's it.  The album as a whole encompasses enough styles
    to sound almost like a cover album.  Many of the tracks sound vaguely familiar,
    with Richman providing new lyrics.  The rhythmic progression of ""Springtime in
    New York"" is just like Prince's ""The Beautiful Ones""; ""Tonight"" is ""Earth Angel"";
    and others were agonizingly hard to place, but I think mostly, the familiarity is
    just the result of the deceptive simplicity of these songs.</p><p>
    Albums this unpretentious are increasingly rare, and I think that's what makes
    <i>Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow</i> so seductive.  We all used to
    view the world this way before we hit puberty, got a job, got dumped a few times
    and became so suspicious of others' motives.  It's nice to know we have albums
    like this to turn on instead of CNN when we want things to be just a little less
    complicated.</p></div>"|6781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6781-her-mystery-not-of-high-heels-and-eye-shadow/|8.0|Nathan Rooney

    enough attention, anything can become interesting, and a source of inspiration.
    It's only when we try to ignore something-- say, a sound-- that it becomes
    annoying or boring.</p><p>
    
    I'm not sure of the universality of that statement, but such is the case with
    Champaign, Illinois' Laterna on its long-delayed sophomore album, <i>Elm Street</i>.
    All instrumental, and performed exclusively on guitar, ARP synth, and drum kit,
    <i>Elm Street</i> features 12 ambient, minimalist treks through inner and outer
    space. If you allow them, the songs will just kind of hang there like an old
    landscape painting in your grandmother's parlor that no one ever looks at. But
    if you're in the right frame of mind (maybe after a couple cups of coffee), the
    record immerses you in a idyllic, windswept world of sound. It's the kind of music
    that might accompany a film adaptation of Ray Bradbury's <i>Dandelion Wine</i>:
    safe and sentimental, while simultaneously implying a darker, harsher world.</p><p>
    
    The album begins with the title track, which starts with a finely picked acoustic
    guitar pattern, slowly fading cymbal crashes (if you can even call them crashes)
    and distant droning. It's got a pastoral, quaint, and jovial quality that makes
    it sound like segue music from ""Northern Exposure.""  ""B-Minor"" is next, introducing
    an electrified, U2-sounding guitar jangle to the mix that sticks around for nearly
    the entire album, its echo and reverb set on maximum.</p><p>
    
    The next set of songs-- ""Spirits,"" ""Thirty,"" and ""Departure""-- indistinguishably
    meld into one elongated cycle, undercutting the playful, jovial vibe of the first
    two tracks with an increasingly eerie and spooky build-up, and making greater use
    of the ARP.   By the time the creepy, sci-fi-sounding ""Old Seattle"" comes around,
    the guitar has virtually been abandoned.  But then it's quickly back to Earth with
    ""Wolves,"" which as might be guessed, uses some cheesy FX to mimic a certain lupine
    howl.</p><p>
    
    ""Smoke,"" with its galloping rhythm, is the sound trying to get home before
    nightfall, while ""Saturn's Rings,"" despite its otherworldly title, sounds more
    like that nightfall slowly settling in, like it does on long summer days. ""New
    Moon"" returns to the acoustic ambience of the lead-off track minus the drums,
    while ""Glass"" is the exact opposite: as the closest thing to a ""rocker"" you're gonna
    get with this album, the song's drums come out of hibernation and there's even a
    touch of distortion on the guitar. ""Dog Days"" rounds out the album with a 12-minute
    patience-tester that fades out with the late-summer drones of cicada and cricket
    chirps-- a nice touch to cap off the album, but a bit long to wait for it.</p><p>
    
    Upon first listen, I mistook Lanterna's brand of slow-paced sonic sculpture for
    new age music, and they do lean in that direction from time to time, veering
    dangerously close to ""Songs of the Whale"" territory.  But after a few times
    through, I saw something closer to Fripp/Eno or even instrumental Felt, though
    not nearly as layered as the former and not as chiming and riff-oriented as the
    latter. And though the band is still a long way from such minimalist masters as
    Glass, Reich, or Riley, they still successfully manage to do a whole lot within
    the very narrow confines they've set for themselves.</p></div>"|4688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4688-elm-street/|6.5|Jason Nickey

While other people spend hours at
    a time hunched over their respective instruments, trying desperately to come up
    with a single song that's worth a damn, you can do better things with your time.
    For instance, you can feed a hungry child.  Or you can build a terrarium.  Or, if
    you're so inclined, you can record a terrible album with your talented musician
    friends.</p><p>
    
    Of course, talent is not without its down side.  One of the most common arguments
    used in the defense of shitty music is, ""Hey, man, these guys may not be the best
    musicians in the world, but they work totally hard!  I've known them for years,
    and I've never known more hard-working, dedicated people.  Fuck you for judging
    them!  They once slept on my couch!  I know the bassist's sister!""  In other words:
    ""They have no talent, but they try really hard.""  But when a slew of crazily
    talented musicians come together and turn out a sloppy and tossed-off mess,
    things are a little harder to justify.</p><p>
    
    The Drag City Supersession is made up of core musicians Bill Callahan ((Smog)),
    Rian Murphy, Neil Michael Hagerty, and Edith Frost.  All are talented performers
    and songwriters; all have made significant contributions to the world of
    independent music; and all have done so in their own distinctively unique ways.
    Yet with <i>Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils</i>, the focus that has enabled
    these musicians to create such convincing work is entirely absent.  And as they
    struggle through weak-as-fuck Sabbath covers and barely rehearsed originals, it
    leaves this record sounding less like a Supersession than a high school talent
    show.</p><p>
    
    Sloppiness is okay when it's a by-product of uncontainable energy.  But on
    <i>Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils</i>, with its awkward, fumbling guitar
    parts and poorly arranged strings, one can't help but feel that this was a
    project thrown together quickly by people who really didn't give a fuck about
    it.  There's no energy.  There's no fun.  There's no reason for them to subject
    people to this.</p><p>
    
    Within the first few seconds of the Bill Callahan original, ""Zero Degrees,"" that
    opens the record, it's clear that <i>Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils</i> isn't
    going to be an easy ride.  The song itself is not nearly up to par with most of
    Callahan's material, relying mostly upon a vaguely dissonant and tremendously
    uninteresting bass riff.  But as the song develops, it becomes clear why Callahan
    wouldn't have wanted one of his better songs to appear on this record-- it's hard
    to imagine somebody saying, ""Why don't I use one of my best songs for this new,
    thrown-together 'Supersession' so that Neil Michael Hagerty can skullfuck it with
    an out-of-tune slide guitar?""  There's nothing wrong with being a little out of
    tune when the music calls for it, but the combination of sloppy, tuneless guitar,
    and pointless, unmelodic bass makes ""Zero Degrees"" nothing short of painful
    listening.  If the musicians involved in this record actually listened back to
    this kind of thing and said, ""Man, I can't <i>wait</i> for my name to be attached
    to this,"" they should at the very least retire, and at the very most be force-fed
    their own ears.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps I'm being a little too hard on these people.  Their collective musical
    talents have given me hours upon hours of enjoyment, and musical memories that
    will last me for the rest of my life.  But all that just doesn't change the fact
    that <i>Tramps, Traitors and Little Devils</i> blows.  At its best, like on Edith
    Frost's ""Leaving the Army,"" it's sufficiently unobtrusive, with unnecessary guitar
    plunking only minimally fucking up an otherwise passable song.  Hey, on ""Old Man,""
    when Frost is basically left to her own for a little while, it's downright pretty.
    But as a ""Supersession,"" with no one musician's vision guiding the way, Drag
    City's impressive roster is reduced to a tuneless jam band whose members don't
    even sound like they're having a good time.  Drag City, indeed.</p></div>"|2439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2439-tramps-traitors-and-little-devils/|3.2|Matt LeMay

    was no such thing as a musician. That's not to say there was no music, of course.
    Among small tribes of people in Africa or the early Americas, there was no such
    thing as a musician because there was no such thing as a non-musician. Music was
    a daily part of everyone's life, and without modern conveniences like turntables
    and CD players, that music had to be made anew every day.  Now, when it came time
    to doing this, were there those that stepped up, stood out, took the lead?
    Probably. But it's also a pretty safe bet that there was no such thing as an
    audience. The making of music was for everybody, as important a part of their
    lives as the food they ate or the air they breathed.</p><p>

    there are those who still scoff at such segregation, those who recognize that
    music is in the hearts of us all-- it merely needs to be conjured up. For every
    buzzkill who believes music to be a solely academic exercise, there are those who
    believe otherwise, those who recognize that when it comes to making music, there's
    something more important than training, discipline or hard work: passion. There
    are, to this day, people who believe, as did the far wiser souls who graced these
    grounds before us, that music is a crucial, healing force that all can and must
    play a part in. For these people, there is the No-Neck Blues Band, an ironically
    named New York based octet making music rooted in the tradition of people for whom
    music was not some mere frivolity, but a way of life.</p><p>
    
    The music on <i>Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones but Words Will Never Hurt Me</i>
    has a very primal feel about it. These are songs built out of the chants, moans
    and screams of its makers every bit as much as pianos, guitars, basses, harmonicas,
    flutes, horns and drums. The songs here often start slow, with one, two or three
    members of the group picking up a simple musical idea and running with it.  Very
    patiently, they'll elaborate on their chosen theme, while the rest of the octet
    flounders about it, searching for different ways to interact, waiting for the
    right point of entry. This is a fascinating process, one which allows the listener
    to observe while these songs are repeatedly built, taken apart and put back
    together.</p><p>
    
    ""Assignment Subud,"" for example, one of the few tracks on the album given a name,
    begins with a prolonged period of improvised noise. Percussion is played
    haphazardly, bereft of any rhythm. Woodwinds and strings enter and exit, each
    taking their own paths and unconcerned with the other instruments. Guitars are
    strummed at random. A spastic saxophone interjects wildly.  A few minutes in, a
    distant female voice appears in the mix as the percussion tightens slightly, like
    buzzards coming together from disparate parts of the sky, starting to circle,
    preparing to swoop down upon a carcass. A bass is bowed, a male voice joins in.
    The two singers interact, not concerning themselves with words, using their voices
    instead as instruments. By the six-minute mark, the pieces begin to come together;
    the guitar parts begin to resemble a melody, the vocals take a non-static pattern
    and the percussion section tightens, now keeping a very discernable, very driven
    beat around which the other instruments sculpt their improvisations.  From here
    on in, the song propels itself, building towards a dramatic climax where the
    saxophone returns, squealing madly as the male vocalist cries out in passion. He
    speaks no words, and yet the listener understands.</p><p>
    
    Other songs, like ""The Natural Bridge,"" the album's opener, move along at a more
    peaceful pace, lingering on a beat and flirting with the idea of structure, like
    a hybrid between an Native American chant and the Art Ensemble of Chicago's most
    out-there moments. Elsewhere, on the album's untitled closer, the group nearly
    finds song structure, employing Beefheartian tendencies (both in the instrumentation
    and the vocals) to their style, actual lyrics, and a surprisingly funky bass part
    to the group's lazy groove. It almost seems strange after the freedom that
    precedes it, but ultimately, it makes sense. No-Neck is a band constantly
    experimenting and constantly <i>playing</i>, in the most innocent, childlike
    sense of the word.  It only makes sense, then, that eventually they'd stumble
    upon something that resembles a traditional song.  And by closing the album on
    this note, No-Neck and veteran producer Jerry Jester (Tom Waits, the Lovin'
    Spoonful) quiet those jaded naysayers out there who will attempt to dismiss the
    inspired, free-spirited nature of the music on <i>Sticks and Stones</i> as
    amateurish wankery.</p><p>
    
    Still, No-Neck's primal brand of improvisation might be a hard sell for some. A
    friend of mine scoffed upon first hearing this album. ""I dunno,"" he said. ""It's
    okay, but it sounds a lot like a bunch of us just jamming in the basement. Maybe
    I'm just not giving us enough credit, but I don't really get it."" But that's just
    it-- he wasn't giving us enough credit. When I play music with my friends, we
    don't do it with any intentions of fame, money or recognition. We do it because
    it's fun. We do it because we love to do it. There's a certain quality, something
    magical to these sorts of haphazard musical excursions where what's missing in
    proper structure and form is more than made up for in passion and energy. And it's
    this same quality that makes the No-Neck Blues Band so damned amazing.</p><p>
    
    The more I think about it, the less I consider the No-Neck Blues Band's name to be
    ironic. In a sense, the music on <i>Sticks and Stones</i> has more to do with the
    blues than the surface lets on. Maybe not in structure, but in the way it
    transforms raw emotion into musical gold. By shunning the traditional rules of
    their form, throwing away all expectations, ignoring all of art's potential to
    create pressure and just playing, the No-Neck Blues Band has given us an album
    that's every bit as unique as it is moving. Indeed, it's the very freedom from
    typical music rules, the very casual atmosphere in which this music was clearly
    created, that makes it work. This music was not made to sell records or to make
    the musicians household names (in fact, most of the band prefers to remain
    anonymous). No, this music was made for the only reason music should ever be
    made: because it had to be.</p></div>"|5816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5816-sticks-and-stones-may-break-my-bones-but-words-will-never-hurt-me/|9.0|David M. Pecoraro

    ""Whitey"" Whittaker, the official tour bus driver for the non-secretly Canadian
    band Rush for about twenty years.  Legend has it that Geddy Lee played the rough
    mix of their album <i>Signals</i> for Jorma before it was released.  Maybe
    thankfully, the Ayn-noying individualist fetish of ""New World Man"" and ""The Analog
    Kid"" doesn't seem to have rubbed off at all.  Like Geddy Lee, though, Jorma
    Whittaker does happen to be the bassist and lead singer of his band.  But don't
    expect a castrated screech-- we've been spared such torture.</p><p>
    
    Marmoset seems to have blissfully missed the 80s, actually, to be influenced by
    every other decade.  Take ""Golden Cloak,"" one of the band's catchier songs.  It
    sounds similar to the Velvet Underground's ""Ocean,"" an outtake from <i>Loaded</i>:
    the organ swirls like vintage Cale while Whittaker sings in pure Reed pre-glam
    fashion, as if filled with wonderment at the things he's discovering in his own
    song.  He describes the features of the cloak (which ""makes you high""), and then
    he pulls the indie-rawk kiss-off-- they're features, you see, that he's ""so
    fucking sick of.""  The song builds up all this psych-rock mystique just to end
    almost indifferently half a minute later.</p><p>
<i>Record in Red</i> cycles through a grab-bag of styles.  The opener, ""Eyes Are
    Looking,"" is pure Beat Happening pop with its fey ""da da da"" male/female harmonies
    and jangly, lo-fi guitar.  Then, two tracks later, ""Winter"" rips into wild guitar
    theatrics that'll have you asking, ""The Who?""  The driving drums and tight rhythm
    track on ""The City"" recalls the Doors or the Zombies' ""Don't Cry For Me,"" and its
    echoing, overdubbed vox might catch you doing the swim, arms waving past your head
    like it's the 60s all over again.  And just when you expect the entire album to be
    a pastiche of trendy genres, ""December 4th"" drops the drums and the pretense for
    an acoustic number that's equal parts Elliott Smith and Kurt Cobain.</p><p>
    
    In this case, it isn't an insult that you can easily come up with comparisons for
    the band; if anything, Marmoset make a virtue out of neurotic decade-hopping.
    Their erratic talent might seem a bit unfocused at times, since song-length
    averages about two minutes, but Whittaker ties it all together with his charm.
    His self-obsessed and sexxee vocal swoons turn each track into an anthem, even on
    little vignettes like ""Artmaker"" when he adopts a mock-Germanic accent, repeating
    the phrase, ""Artmaker, strangulator,"" into absurdity.  The album gives off a
    slightly dark, druggy vibe, especially when the handclaps and piano jabs of
    ""Summertime Is Easy"" sink under the morbid, endless repetition of Whittaker's
    chorus.  But rather than drown in affectations, overall, <i>Record in Red</i>'s
    coy fascination with itself reminds me of why pop music is so much fun.</p></div>"|5111.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5111-record-in-red/|7.5|Christopher Dare

    roster. While Richard Devine abandoned the notion of DSP fuckery as an end in
    itself with the brooding <i>Aleamapper</i> LP and Scott Herren has put his
    trad-IDM persona Delarosa and Asora on ice in favor of hip-hop stylings of
    Prefuse 73, Von Schirach continues his assault on stasis unabated with his second
    album, the frenetic <i>Escalo Frio</i>.</p><p>
    
    My first pass through <i>Escalo Frio</i> was most unpleasant. Roughly half of the
    21 tracks here seem to me nothing more than Reaktor demonstration pieces,
    overflowing with an incredible array of sounds that call attention to themselves
    without ever working together to say anything interesting, or even coherent.
    Tracks like ""Sasquash,"" ""Coconut"" and ""Fog"" are almost unbearable to sit through,
    consisting of an endless stream of self-consciously ""weird"" sounds that never
    coalesce, never swing, and can provoke no reaction beyond a steadily increasing
    annoyance. Quite honestly, I cannot understand the appeal of this post-Autechre
    spastic colonoscopy; it seems meaningless and terminally boring.</p><p>
    
    The only way I can make sense of the worst tracks on <i>Escalo Frio</i> is to place
    them into some kind cartoon music framework. Carl Stalling was, of course, the
    genius that wrote music for Warner Brothers' Loony Toons (he's frequently
    namechecked by John Zorn). Schirach's rapid changes and unfamiliar textures
    could possibly serve as the soundtrack to a parallel world built from alternate
    physics, much like the one alluded to by Stalling's genre-surfing and zany
    deployment of effects. Still, try as I might to imagine how this music might work
    for somebody else, I still don't believe it could ever work for me.</p><p>
    
    But these are the worst tracks I'm talking about-- the cluttered, aimless displays
    of programming technique that mar more than half this disc.  Fortunately, a few
    tracks manage to make a better impression after a while. Of particular interest
    is Schirach's dabbling in cut-up hip-hop, reminiscent of Prefuse 73 without
    seeming like a rip-off. The criminally brief ""Mr. Egyptian Hologram"" (which
    features some production assistance from Matmos), for example, is a killer track,
    containing an MC sample twisted into rhythmic knots, nostalgic toy synths, and a
    forceful bass punch. Coming from a similar place but without the vocals is
    ""Fabric,"" which is home to one of the record's few head-nodding rhythms and a
    production environment that allows the cutting electro rhythm room to breath.
    Still, in the end, these brief glimpses into Schirach's potential as an auteur
    of 23rd-century Jeep music only make the rest of the album that much more
    difficult to bear.</p></div>"|8492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8492-escalo-frio/|3.3|Mark Richard-San

That is, she started
    playing the way you're supposed to: learning etudes, playing scales, practicing
    all the correct fingerings, being as precise as humanly possible.  It's enough
    to drive you mad, and I suppose that explains why so many concert pianists have
    hair like Dudley Moore and talk like... well, Dudley Moore.  Fujii started down
    this path, only to hit a brick wall about 20 years into the game.  So, she gave
    it up for communal stomp-n-yell sessions and cathartic group improv.  The end.</p><p>
    
    Nope.  After a year of gathering her wits, she decided jazz was where it was at,
    and returned to her studied piano with a different aim.  She went back to taking
    lessons, but this time with renowned Japanese jazz pianist Fumio Itabashi.  Of
    course, her parents didn't approve of the new direction, so Fujii struck out on
    her own.  She eventually left for America, to study at Berklee College of Music,
    graduating in 1987.  She went back to Japan, and made a humble rep by playing in
    jazz clubs and on television and commercial soundtracks.  The end.</p><p>
    
    Not quite.  A few years later, Fujii was accepted to the New England Conservatory
    of Music, from which she received a Graduate Degree in Jazz Performance in 1996.
    There, she had the opportunity to learn from greats like Paul Bley, Cecil McBee
    and George Russell.  Her first album even featured Bley, and many had a difficult
    time recognizing who was playing at what point, such was her stylistic advancement.
    Today, having worked with new jazz luminaries like Mark Dresser, Jim Black, Mark
    Feldman, and big bands from both New York and Japan, Fujii is recognized as one
    of the greatest Japanese jazz musicians alive.  And she is living happily ever
    after.  The end.</p><p>
    
    But this is not the end.  The deal is, despite the ridiculous amount of jazz
    preparation and education Fujii seems to have had, her latest release, <i>Vulcan</i>,
    barely sounds like jazz at all.  What's the story?  You'd think that when your
    biggest reference points are supposed to be folks like Bley and Myra Melford that
    your album wouldn't initially remind you of avant-proggers like the Soft Machine
    or the Muffins (Cuneiform Records: check 'em).  We're talking extra-hard drumming
    and improv that often is so off the beaten path I keep waiting for the quartet
    (Fujii, trumpeter Natsuki Tamura, bassist Takeharu Hayakawa, and drummer-god
    Tatsuya Yoshida) to implode rather than work through the storms, and come out
    standing, as they do like clockwork every time.  And this is most certainly not
    an end, but yet another incredible beginning from Fujii.</p><p>
<i>Vulcan</i> begins with the epic ""The Sun in a Moonlight Night"" and Yoshida's
    guttural shaman vocals, accompanied by Tamura's electric/underwater horn and
    some elastic bass fingerprints scattered here and there.  Soon, Fujii joins the
    mini-ruckus by pretending to be Cecil Taylor for a time, though always in the
    background.  So, yes, this is what they call ""free jazz,"" or in some quarters,
    ""noodling.""  But then a funny thing happens: Yoshida drops a beat, and Fujii
    drops a riff, and it becomes what they call ""super-rock.""  And it remains this
    for a whole two minutes or so before changing into a number from Bizet's
    <i>Carmen</i> (if it was a bass solo).  Then, Yoshida crashes through the wall
    where most jazz drummers would ""hint at pulse"" or ""play around time"" or some
    such non-jam strategy.  Soon, it's Fujii taking the solo over the massive beats
    and bass bombs.  And then it's Tamura (Fujii's husband) soloing, and-- wait, did
    that solo section last about ten minutes without me even once looking at my
    watch?  Yes, yes it did.  At the end, they come back to the head, and this is
    why it's easy to tell people 15-minute tunes aren't necessarily bad.</p><p>
    
    ""Incident"" begins like a lopsided Jackson Pollock painting; all scribble haze
    impressions and stop/start horn utterances with bass and erratic drumming.  Then,
    the ""song"" proper starts, though the head is arguably even less stable than the
    exposition, with the beat changing as often as the notes in the melody.  It's
    sometimes difficult to tell where the soloing starts and the melody begins,
    but that doesn't keep the tune from jamming, if only in the abstract-dyslexia
    jam sense.</p><p>
    
    Another punchy bass solo begins ""Ninepin,"" and just like before, it seems to
    only obscure the true intentions of this tune.  Soon, the solo falls onto a
    pedal note, and Yoshida ushers in his ominous toms and cymbals.  Fujii enters
    with a vaguely Eastern European head, doubled by Tamura.  This is something like
    that made famous by the NYC clique-mongers John Zorn (with Masada) and Chris
    Speed (solo and with Pachora), but a sight more rock where theirs was stark
    swinging and even harmelodic.  Here, after a lengthy group exposition, Fujii
    solos over a relatively restrained (though increasingly kinetic as it progresses)
    backdrop, and it can still be said that Yoshida is the world's most hyperactive
    drummer.  In fact, soon his cymbal rolls and snare blasts dominate the section--]
    so much so that the tune morphs into a drum solo.  Without launching into a
    treatise on the greatness of Yoshida, I will say that even after a decade of
    incredible Ruins' releases, his playing here is surprisingly fresh, both in its
    single-minded forcefulness, and by the way he effortlessly shifts back into the
    main head of the tune.</p><p>
    
    ""Footstep"" and ""Neko no Yume"" are both quieter entries on a release that seems
    to specialize in that which pounds and sprawls.  The former features dark,
    atmospheric playing from Fujii over light cymbal work and bowed bass howls in
    the distance, and it probably wouldn't sound out of place in a tense ghost story
    soundtrack.  The latter is more straightforward, with Tamura and Hayakawa playing
    the real late-night, smoky jazz dope Chet Baker gets so much credit for (when it
    was probably Miles Davis all along).  In any case, the tune reminds me of nobody
    so much as Dave Douglas (though Tamura doesn't quite possess his technical
    facility), particularly in its juxtaposition of classic cool with modern squawk.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>Vulcan</i> is devoted to much more aggressive aesthetics: ""LH
    Fast"" is Ruins-style jump-cut avant-rock; ""Untitled"" fools you into thinking it
    will be an introspective piano ballad, but is in fact an extroverted,
    Iberian-flavored romp.  And the last tune, ""Junction,"" spells out to anyone who
    wasn't paying attention that this album is about fast and loud jams.  Of course,
    an hour of that can become taking to the ears, and it helps that these guys bring
    it all back home fairly quickly in the tunes more often than not.</p><p>
    
    This quartet has been playing live together since 1998, and it'll be interesting
    to see if they continue to release stuff together.  There are very few working
    jazz groups that demand the attention of the rock audience at the moment.  This
    is certainly no slight on today's jazz artists, but it would seem that the
    demographic gap between jazz and rock is bigger than it was, say, 25 years ago.
    Fujii is one of a handful of artists (including the aforementioned Zorn, Black,
    Speed, and Douglas) who would seem to have as many potential fans in the rock
    world as jazz.  Things like raw energy and inspiration have never been exclusive
    to any musical genre, and it would be a shame if the inspired creativity I hear
    on this album was only heard by a few jazz critics and Japanese music fans.</p></div>"|3245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3245-vulcan/|8.3|Dominique Leone

Consider: Alsace-Lorraine
    is a region in France, lying west of the Rhine on the German border.  The
    oft-disputed region has changed hands dozens of times over the centuries and is
    home to one of the most colossal military failures of the 20th Century-- the
    Maginot Line, an imposing series of defenses intended to guard France's frontier
    from any German advance.  Unfortunately for the French military, in 1939 the
    Germans had no qualms about simply conquering Belgium and going around the
    Maginot Line, rendering it useless.</p><p>
    
    But take away that hyphen and you have Alsace Lorraine, a trio of Chicagoans who
    make pleasant, but ultimately bland pop music with a slight European affectation.
    The band's songs are cut roughly from the same mold as those of Stephin Merritt--
    unfortunately for Alsace Lorraine, though, it seems as though Merritt hogged all
    of the memorable melodies for himself.  As a result, the 16 songs on <i>Through
    Small Windows</i> pass by like a single 40-minute blur of meandering, atmospheric
    pop.   In this instance, atmospheric is not a compliment.</p><p>
    
    Part of the problem may lie in the fact that Caitlin Brice simply doesn't make
    for a convincing frontwoman-- her voice is too wispy to ever come across as
    commanding, and the words she sings too often get lost in the echoing background
    provided by Hewson Chen (also a member of Vitesse) and Paul Francke.  The band's
    formula instantly brings to mind Saint Etienne comparisons, and those comparisons
    hold up to a point; however, any Saint Etienne album will offer more variety and
    interest than this one.</p><p>
<i>Through Small Windows</i> opens with ""You Are Like Charles Lindbergh to Me,""
    though you'd be hard pressed to differentiate it from much of what follows.
    Indeed, often the most interesting aspect of the songs are the titles-- for
    instance, ""Name Etched in Homeroom Chair"" and ""Alex Runs the World"" look
    promising, but the loosely strummed guitars buried low in the mix and textured,
    reverb-drenched synths don't really do much to back up Brice as she attempts to
    convey the lyrics.</p><p>
    
    ""Chalk Marks on the Ground"" manages to distinguish itself better than most of
    the songs here, offering a more solid vocal hook than usual and a slightly more
    upbeat programmed drum rhythm, but the band's overarchingly flaccid music doesn't
    do anything to help drive the writing home.  The lyrics look okay on paper, too,
    with passages like, ""A heart is dead/ Chalk marks are on the ground/ When they
    rolled away the stone to the tomb/ Nobody was found,"" fleshing out the story of
    a misfit rather nicely.</p><p>
    
    ""Dreams I Can't Control,"" the band's first recording, with vocalist Ruth Welte,
    also benefits from a slightly different approach, though it's actually difficult
    to tell Welte's voice from Brice's without knowing about the difference first.
    The trembling synths and mid-tempo Moby beat rather unfortunately conjure images
    of Lexuses travelling across White Sands during prime-time more than they recall
    the teenage heartbreak Welte sings about.  Note to Darla marketing staff: get on
    the phone to Toyota.</p><p>
    
    Further strengthening the Stephin Merritt comparison is ""Though I've Never Seen
    You,"" which sounds so much like something from the Magnetic Fields' <i>Holiday</i>
    that I keep expecting Merritt to start singing, ""You're the trouble I've been
    looking for,"" at any second.  It's followed by the album's closer, ""The Labour
    Day Parade,"" though, an instrumental with a slightly dubby feel that ranks as
    one of the groups' most interesting offerings, even if it can't quite hold my
    attention all the way through.</p><p>
    
    When the laser slides back across its track and the disc stops spinning, nothing
    really lingers, except perhaps for the somewhat gauzy feeling induced by the
    synthesizers.  <i>Through Small Windows</i> proves so utterly innocuous that
    it's hard to imagine anyone having any sort of opinion about it one way or
    another.  In the future, Alsace Lorraine could use a little more Maginot Line
    in their sound-- something prickly or at least a little challenging to latch
    on to.  For now, their music is the rough equivalent of leaving your Corn Flakes
    in the milk for too long, and these flakes have turned into one big lump of mush.
    Sure, you could eat it, but why would you want to?</p></div>"|135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/135-through-small-windows/|5.7|Joe Tangari

    a shaping factor in our lives, addressing its musical manifestation as suggested
    by this group's Darwinian name and album title.  The outline would take shape
    through the idea of natural selection, with different genres like glitch and
    jungle occupying developmental niches in the survival of the fittest, and the
    eventual epochal shift when one lifeform incorporates all those traits.  Let's
    cut to the chase: Posthuman have recorded an awesome album, one of the best
    IDM-oriented releases of 2001.  All the more impressive that <i>The Uncertainty
    of the Monkey</i> is their debut, and the first record for their label Seed.</p><p>
    Little is known about the duo, but the music speaks for itself. ""Jacson of
    Israel_Beautiful Beast"" begins unsettlingly with demonic Blair-Witch-warbling
    while minimal synth winds stir the air and disturbingly artificial snares create
    tension by panning between the channels, regular and yet erratic.  Then the hunt
    begins, a disorienting rush of metallic crashes and whooming bass that descends
    into increasingly complex <i>Confield</i>s.  Posthuman display more sonic range
    than Autechre, though, evidenced as the frantic animal cooings are caught up in
    an austere keyboard melody.  A second, more subdued section of the song begins,
    and the elements slowly subtract themselves from the mix until the 10-minute
    opener concludes in orchestral ambience.</p><p>
    ""15 Seconds to Get to Spain_Hogan"" changes it up with mechanic hip-hop beats,
    funky as fuck, met by a searing synth stab harder than anything El-P cooked up
    on the Can Ox album last year.  Posthuman have an uncanny knack for hiding
    mini-melodies amongst all the wobbly bass, and you can hear them on this track
    as a keyboard accent that lurked in the background gets looped over and over
    until it all ends in cycling claustrophobia.  They play with a very raw sound
    palette, and so the digital sounds are far abstracted from any instrumental
    referents.  Parts of their music imitate the jittering flow of Download, but
    without the emphasis on smacked-up house rhythms.</p><p>
    When the instruments do reveal their origins, as on ""Quetzacotl_Grathard Debacle,""
    it comes startlingly as a harsh acoustic guitar strum appears over the clicking
    mandible chatter and floating keyboards.  So this isn't just a mélange of sounds
    thrown out at once-- each song has a highly narrative structure, like hunting for
    signs of organic life in Future Sound of London's <i>Dead Cities</i>.  A hint of
    the human touch appears with the live version of this song on the last track.
    You can hear a generic trance groove faintly in the background, along with the
    duo fumbling at their decks and muttering back and forth.  Then the actual song
    kicks in, another beat-driven symphony of squelch.</p><p>
    Thanks be to Posthuman, also, for putting the ""dance"" back in Intelligent Dance
    Music.  ""Plethora_Fagans Never Never"" brings the funk with a litany of
    minimalist-techno breaks.  Meanwhile, ""Wednesday"" stalks about the underbrush of
    booming bass and insectile glitch chirps, then catches the scent of a presumably
    Aphexian species.  It pivots and transforms into a stomping electro number, acrid
    avid jam shredding in discombobulated fury.  And ""Wrongfuleyes"" lures with
    prelude-to-the-afternoon-of-a-fawn calmness before morphing into a near-industrial
    anthem complete with dramatic keyboard vamps.</p><p>
<i>The Uncertainty of the Monkey</i> is anything but hesitant.  Posthuman's songs
    are overly confident, and their dark, spacious sound rises up from deep bass in
    the background, a resonant synthesizer midrange and crisp beatscapes in the fore.
    As a debut, this album sets an aggressive mood, but the cold atmosphere doesn't
    alienate-- instead, there's the draw of a certain predatorial sexuality.  And in
    the deft combination of narrative structure, dense sonic texture and progressive
    rhythm, the duo have secured a place for themselves in IDM history.  I wish there
    was more reconnaissance on them-- rumors abound about their affiliation with Skam
    Records and the bashes they host in London's Aldwych disused underground station.
    But if you follow the ""secret"" link on their homepage, you'll discover photos of
    the band and their mates, living it up in various flats and generally looking
    like they haven't a care in the world.  It's a refreshing bit of humanity amongst
    all the cybernetic atmosphere, and the glimpse of a poster of Orbital's <i>In
    Sides</i> on a back wall reveals another trace of familial history.</p></div>"|6439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6439-the-uncertainty-of-the-monkey/|8.6|Christopher Dare

    &amp; Ohio and Western Maryland Railroads, Chessie are back with their third album
    of locomotive ambience and post-rock caboosery. Far from being a fish-paste
    sandwich-munching trainspotter saddo, Stephen Gardner, Chessie's founding member,
    makes railways sound kinda brainy. Gardner, originally the bassist for D.C.'s
    Lorelei, started this project as an outlet for his explorations into sound
    collage, tape loop rhythms, guitar noise, and the similarity-- as he puts it--
    between organic and constructed sounds and the ""way that railroads bisect the
    natural world with machinery.""</p><p>
    
    Chessie's debut, <i>Signal Series</i>, won Amazon.com's best Dance and DJ album
    for 1998.  In Gardner's words, the album sought ""to set up patterns of conflicting
    and interacting machinery in natural settings."" Thus, he allowed pummeling old
    school hardcore breakbeats to rampage through drifts of scorching ambience.
    Bolstered by the permanent addition of studio engineer Ben Bailes, Chessie toned
    the beats down for the far-more Tortoise-y <i>Meet</i>, an album for which the
    band never won a single gong.  After the release of <i>Meet Andy Ingalls</i>, a
    guest on <i>Meet</i>'s ""Brake Test"" became a full-time contributor to the group.</p><p>
    
    Though the band's latest release, <i>Overnight</i>, reprises the style of <i>Meet</i>
    rather than <i>Signal Series</i>, <i>Overnight</i> is, for me, a more confident,
    concentrated album. Chessie sound secure in leaving dead air. This is nowhere
    better demonstrated than during ""K-Tower."" An anxious but investigative bassline
    searches through spines of guitar tweaks, as though Richie Hawtin had remixed
    Public Image Ltd.'s ""Albatross.""  ""Pantograph Up"" takes the opposite tack and
    pushes white noise and four-to-the-floor beats beyond the red zone in a loving
    homage to <i>Succour</i>-era Seefeel.</p><p>
    
    ""S to U"" showcases the band's dexterity with a six-string-- the track sounds like
    the Cocteau Twins' shimmer blended with the Sundays' pop-nous with Durrutti
    Column's Vini Reilly on solo detail. ""Lineside"" roils like Main's deep listening
    firmament. ""Cross Harbor Interchange"" launches off from loops of bursting white
    noise beneath which almost metronomic rhythmic pulses clatter, as though an
    immense locomotive juggernaut is passing by the listener. In this regard, ""Cross
    Harbor Interchange"" is an update of <i>Signal Series</i>' ""Clear Block."" By
    contrast, <i>Overnight</i> takes a branchline trip into a fuzzed-out, Oval-ized
    version of Eno's <i>Music for Airports</i> with the sparse ""Northern Maine
    Junction.""</p><p>
    
    Plug Research have shown sound judgment in adding Chessie to their roster. Though
    ""Northern Maine Junction"" is the only <i>Overnight</i> track that fits immediately
    within the label's aesthetic, Plug Research recognizes talent. As with labelmates
    Soulo, Chessie now have the support and the encouragement to make The Great Leap.
    After <i>Signal Series</i> and <i>Meet</i>, <i>Overnight</i> contains few
    surprises; it's a logical progression from the group's previous releases, and I
    have no quibble with its high quality. But where's the whiff of danger, the
    thrill of the unknown? It's understandable that a band so influenced by railroads
    should wish to avoid derailment at all costs, but sometimes riding hobo-style on
    Risk's runaway loco is what it takes to get you crashing into the festooned
    buffers of Glory Central Station.</p></div>"|1435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1435-overnight/|7.6|Paul Cooper

    Daniel Johnston material. First, there was last year's surprisingly coherent
    and successful <i>Rejected Unknown</i>, followed by the reissue of Jad Fair and
    Daniel Johnston's 1989 collaboration, <i>It's Spooky</i>. A recent Target ad
    even featured Mary Lou Lord covering his ""Speedy Motorcycle.""  And now comes
    <i>The Lucky Sperms: Somewhat Humorous</i>, the second such joint effort between
    Texas' favorite Captain America-worshiping troubadour of questionable mental
    stability and the bespectacled Half Japanese founder and Harry Potter look-a-like
    Jad Fair.</p><p>
    
    Anyone familiar with the previous collaboration between these two-- or any of
    their other projects, really-- probably knows what to expect with this one:
    rag-tag, shambling songs, most sounding half-completed, and judging from the
    fidelity, recorded on a Talk Boy. The secondary title of this album has it just
    about right: ""somewhat humorous."" Somewhat annoying, somewhat brilliant, and
    somewhat scary, are also good ways to describe it.</p><p>
    
    In a lot of ways, <i>The Lucky Sperms</i> sounds pretty tossed-off, interspersing
    maybe some leftover stuff Johnston recorded during the last seven years with a
    few random Jad Fair tracks, which isn't a totally bad thing.  Johnston, whose
    material comprises about half the album, starts us off with ""Movie,"" a typical--
    and typically moving-- piano-based ode to unrequited love and melancholia.  The
    harrowing ""Death"" follows, offering vivid glimpses into Johnston's idiosyncratic
    and highly-developed mythic system.</p><p>
    
    Jad, for his part, serves up five noisy, stomping counterparts to Johnston's
    piano melodies. He also handles the album's production, if you want to call it
    that. His first contribution, ""Yes, We Can,"" sounds more than a little like a
    Johnston tune, at least thematically, contemplating Batman's relative power and
    recalling, ""'What power is in the words,'/ The Byrds asked Bob Dylan.""  ""Coffee
    Cup,"" meanwhile, relates that ""Peter Pan refused to grow up/ I want more coffee
    in my coffee mug/ If you want treasure you've got to dug/ You've got to dug ya
    dig?"" And what can you really say about that?  A truism if there ever was one.</p><p>
    
    Mid-album, the guys also pull out their covers, including the Beatles' ""Michelle""
    and the Stones' ""Ruby Tuesday"" back-to-back.  The former is given and laid back
    with an almost reggae rhythm and the French lyrics hilariously slurred through,
    and ""Ruby Tuesday"" is given a barrelhouse piano reading by Johnston.  Near the
    end of the album, they throw together a medley of standards and not-so-standards
    called ""Melody,"" featuring bits and pieces of ""On Top of Old Smokey,"" Simon and
    Garfunkel's ""Bridge over Troubled Water,"" Aerosmith's ""Take Me to the Other Side,""
    ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Ding-Dong the Wicked Witch is Dead,"" among others. But
    even these pleasures are short lived. They're enjoyable enough in the moment, but
    like the album as a whole, I can't say I'll be making the return trip very often.</p></div>"|2956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2956-the-lucky-sperms-somewhat-humorous/|6.1|Jason Nickey

To this day, for all our technical know-how and
    scientific explorations, we still understand very little about how it works.
    Still, there's no denying its amazing capabilities. From sheer storage capability
    and the power for reasoning, to the oft-discussed theories of telepathy and the
    strange but undeniably incredible stunts of your average savant, it seems the
    brain's powers are close to endless. Perhaps its most amazing feat of all, though,
    is its ability to convince itself of things it simply knows cannot be true. Like
    the urban legends about an alcoholic woman with nothing else to live for who
    carries around her dead baby, cradling it and cooing its name, convinced it's
    still alive. Or the child who watches his father beat his mother, but chooses
    not to acknowledge it, finding it easier to believe it never happened than to
    deal with the repercussions. Or the thirty-year-old man who insists that
    professional wrestling is real. Or the music critic that convinces himself that
    there's no vocalist in Fin Fang Foom.</p><p>
    And why not? The music on <i>Texture, Structure, and the Condition of Moods</i>
    is interesting, if not necessarily innovative. Granted, this guitar/bass/drums
    rock trio is hung up on that whole juxtaposition of the fast and slow, and the
    abrasive and quiet.  And yes, they've been duped into thinking a Casio keyboard
    part here and there will make them seem sensitive. Still, the instrumentation is
    competent, and on occasion, some of these songs are even sort of interesting.</p><p>
    Fin Fang Foom might not be up to the U.S. Maple standard for disjointed rock
    music, but they're certainly a step up from most of the generic crap that ends
    up festering in my review pile for weeks on end. Certainly, a decent group like
    this would recognize the good things they've got going for them, and wouldn't go
    and fuck everything up by adding vocals, right?  Especially not really retching,
    grating, off-key vocals that bring to mind that forbidden e-word.  Nope. There's
    just no reason. And certainly, they wouldn't have an equally incompetent back-up
    vocalist, showing up from time to time to take things from bad to simply
    unbearable. Nah, they'd know better.</p><p>
    And even if, for some godforsaken reason, they insisted on adding vocals,
    certainly they'd manage to find something less cliché than, oh, I dunno, ""Angel
    love, why so thin and pale?/ Don't you realize your soul is for sale?"" Right?
    They would, wouldn't they?</p><p>
    It seems safe to say that any group competent enough to master the tricky stops
    and starts and the left-field time changes of songs like ""At Age 23"" and ""Iron
    Coat"" (two of <i>Texture, Structure and the Convocation of Moods</i>' more
    intriguing moments) would also realize that lyrics like, ""Laughing at my
    frustration/ Realizing the truth/ No fear of confrontation/ A few more words
    then we're through,"" are painful in their mediocrity, especially when followed
    by a refrain that goes, ""I scrape my scars again/ My blood my one best friend.""
    And so, like an emotionally deranged 15-year-old who fervently insists that
    there's still a Santa Claus, I maintain that Fin Fang Foom has no vocalist.</p><p>
    After all, I don't want to be mean. Contrary to popular belief, we critics don't
    like writing negative reviews. And these guys do have potential. They're like
    Sweep the Leg Johnny, just without the saxophone, slightly more structured and a
    lot less interesting. Maybe one day, they'll recognize the error of their ways,
    focus on the instrumentals, take the music down that road marked complexity they
    all seem to be eyeing with a bit of trepidation, and who knows, maybe they'll
    be worth a recommendation. In the meantime, I'll just continue to enjoy these
    solid instrumentals thanks to the amazing power of self-deception.</p></div>"|3057.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3057-texture-structure-and-the-condition-of-moods/|5.5|David M. Pecoraro

Your
    friends at <i>Pitchfork</i> have an 87.9% successful suckage spotter.  And though
    there are occasionally some oversights-- both artists and critics have bad days--
    we're ultimately on your side, kid.  There are some things you shouldn't have
    time or money appropriating. In fact, there are (and I believe this, deeply)
    some things you just shouldn't have to hear.</p><p>
    
    The Push Kings' <i>Feel No Fade</i> is rife with unanswered questions. Like, for
    example, why a mediocre indie pop quartet hates its audience so much that they
    would compose and construct this travesty.  Or the reasons why the record label
    green-lighted its release-- mental fogginess due to drugs? Perverse and damaging
    sense of humor? Mob threats? It's anyone's guess. But they better have a pretty
    fucking good excuse.</p><p>
    
    I really wish I had never, ever heard this.</p><p>
    
    The thing is, I've been in a pretty good mood lately-- ordinary ups and downs of
    life notwithstanding-- and summoning up the mass of vitriol necessary for
    eviscerating this album the way it should be has required a considerable
    sacrifice of peace of mind on my part. I figure this for a humanitarian gesture.
    Save yourself. This album is so awful it hurt my feelings.</p><p>
<i>Feel No Fade</i> is appallingly glossy, insipid, vacuous cheese-puff pop
    music. So bad it warrants negative musical comparisons to such luminaries as
    Third Eye Blind and Matchbox 20. Apt description would necessitate me believing
    that there are more offensive and grotesque lapses of aesthetic judgment than
    the entirety of Rob Thomas' career. In order to convey my physical reaction to
    this album, I'd have to draw up analogies to eating tablespoons of mayonnaise on
    an empty stomach after drinking a six-pack of peach flavored wine coolers.  And
    frankly, that's not a leap I'm terribly excited about taking.</p><p>
    
    The supposed ideal audience for this album currently lives on a lackluster block
    of neutral-toned tract mansions in the suburbs of some forgettable,
    brass-and-glass, corporate banking metropolis. Her name is Ashley. She is
    thirteen years old, and has recently become disillusioned with Britney Spears.
    She dreams of turning sixteen years old, so she can get a brand new bubblegum
    pink convertible, no, jeep, no, convertible, with fuzzy leopard print seat covers
    and a matching cell phone. And perhaps, she can get a fun job at Abercrombie and
    Fitch for the employee discounts and access to ""like, totally hot college boys""
    on summer break. She already knows which sorority she wants to pledge Freshman
    year of college, and thinks Creed is ""a little too hardcore for me.""</p><p>
    
    Somehow or another, her best friend (and captain of the Junior High Cheerleading
    Squad) gets passed a copy of <i>Feel No Fade</i>, and it becomes the soundtrack
    to Ashley's life. Her long-suffering, indulgent yuppie mom is forced to play
    track six, ""Honey Come Closer,"" on the way to school every morning so her
    daughter can bounce along and imagine ""totally hot"" (but nothing below the neck)
    romantic encounters with guys that look like Pacey from ""Dawson's Creek."" Ashley
    and her friends paint their nails at slumber parties and choreograph amateur
    dance moves to ""Beat Girl (and Me)."" And she knows all the words to ""Summer
    Trippin',"" and pulls her boombox into the bathroom to sing to the cute
    ""doo-doo-doo"" chorus while showering. And sometimes she stands in the bedroom
    mirror wondering if her stomach will ever be as thin as the tanned, tattooed
    female torso which serves as the cover art for <i>Feel No Fade</i>.  She thinks
    maybe she would like to date one of the Push Kings.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, sometime around Ashley's fourteenth birthday, her interest starts
    to wane. Maybe the sparkling clean, sugar-coated guitar line in ""Rocket N' Time""
    starts to sound a bit tired on the 400th listen. Or maybe, despite their best
    intentions, the Push Kings fail to interest the geniuses in charge of soundtracking
    the next WB teen drama. Or maybe she starts dating her next-door neighbor-- a
    barely post-voice change fifteen-year-old boy. He introduces her to Jimmy Eat
    World, which, compared to the Push Kings, is deeply complex, profoundly moving,
    seriously hardcore, and fraught with dangerous sexuality.</p><p>
    
    I usually think pure pop music is unfairly scorned.  It's what it is: an idle,
    easy upper, analogous to pixie stix or cake icing. It can be addictive, but
    that's usually tempered by our collective inability to digest that much sugar
    without uncomfortable side effects. Even the most pretentious music snob can be
    counted on for the occasional foray into the pastel-hued and candy-coated. Ignore
    their impossibly lame defenses and justifications; pop music is great because you
    can like it without really having to explain why.</p><p>
    
    That being said, <i>Feel No Fade</i> makes a strong case for strict eye-for-an-eye
    justice, allowing all unwilling victims of its soul-sucking, commercial banality
    the privilege of publicly shaming their favorite Push King. There is absolutely
    no excuse for this shit.</p></div>"|6516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6516-feel-no-fade/|0.1|Alison Fields

    in the mix), with the vocals most often piped in via DAT or found sound.  We
    have guitars, but they're usually not playing like guitars, opting for figures
    more remote and abstract than anthemic.  And how the synthesizers will drone on,
    like troubled waters raging beneath all the distorted calm and alien footwork by
    which the faceless soldiers who articulate this music traverse.  Above all, I
    would say this kind of trip goes against the nature of non-aggressive expression,
    because when you're playing stuff that's more likely to scare your constituents
    than sooth them, chances are that your music will only get played by folks as
    dark or darker than you.  This means that whatever hard politics or soft terror
    you want to transmit is probably doomed to one-to-one transmissions rather than
    grassroots, populist revolution.</p><p>
    
    Okay, so dark ambient music may not be so inherently subversive at heart, but
    when I think of many of its major proponents-- GYBE!, Keiji Haino, Richard
    Pinhas, KK Null, Nurse with Wound-- I usually do think of spooky, ultra-serious
    ex-noise-shamans who would sooner set fire to a government building than flash a
    smile.  And that much of this music features the beamed-in sounds of samples,
    field recordings and industrial commotion doesn't exactly lend it the human
    touch.</p><p>
    
    Of course, that may be the point entirely.  San Francisco's Elders of Zion--
    comprised of co-conspirators Joel Schalit (current editor of <i>Punk Planet</i>
    and ex-Christal Methodist) and Asphodel Records engineer Vance Galloway-- use
    these hallowed techniques to great effect, seemingly to raise awareness of some
    brand of leftist political rhetoric (though, the impression of this is more
    evident than an actual agenda set forth).  Now, if revolution were the goal,
    then it would make sense not to muddy the message with atonal atmospherics, but
    to just come out and state your claims.  However, if you just wanted to put a
    little scare on people, then records like <i>Dawn Refuses to Rise</i> would make
    a lot more sense.  There's something ominous on the horizon, and I can't quite
    make out what it is, but it's bad, it's got serious politics and it's going to
    get you.</p><p>
    
    Elders of Zion make their racket with traditional rock instrumentation (put
    through gosh knows how many layers of post-production), and a library of
    spoken word samples, ranging from American protest demonstrations to Israeli
    children to Godard-obsessed French Maoists.  If that sounds a bit heavy to
    you, well, it is; but then the music, albeit dark, is never really angry or
    even all that loud, so if you felt like tuning it out, you probably could.</p><p>
    
    The title track wastes no time in painting it all black with screeching guitar
    lines and orchestras of basses and synths and big drums, like the weird outro
    groove of the Beatles' ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and an imaginary soundtrack
    to airplanes landing.  Next: ""Future Avant-Garde Society,"" despite being a lot
    faster, is exactly as thick and suffocating as the previous tune.  Throughout
    the record, the band emphasizes their ability to turn any groove into a
    nightmarish vamp.  There's a sample in this one that goes, ""The best noisemakers
    are not necessarily the best peacemakers.""  Damn right.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, things get a tad more chemically enhanced.  ""#1 in Gaza This Week,""
    with its siren-effects and pounding, reverb-laden beat, could be some kind of
    tone-poem for inner-city strife (or some such relevant issue), but mostly just
    seems like an acid test gone awry.  I could say the same for ""Eject the Push
    Button Punks,"" ""Rubber Bullet Rock"" and ""Like a Fish Out of Water,"" which modify
    the lysergic groove with hi-speed d-n-b beats, reggae skank and sheer sonic
    pummeling via a restless snare and a manic electro-drone from synthesizer and
    guitar.</p><p>
    
    The biggest issue I have with this record is that the best parts (hard beats,
    endless arrays of psyche-effects and apocalyptic feedback) can become a bit
    mindnumbing after a while, to the point that they end becoming the worst parts.
    Drummer Luis Illades must have permanent bruises on his fingers from these
    sessions, and I would hate to have co-leaders Joel Schalit and Vance Galloway's
    eardrums, voluntarily subjected to hours of militant protest field recordings
    and far gone space effects.  Again, it's not really that loud, but they just
    never let up.  If you can handle the trip, <i>Dawn Refuses to Rise</i> can be a
    rather fascinating travel guide for journeys into the outer regions.</p></div>"|2721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2721-dawn-refuses-to-rise/|7.6|Dominique Leone

    advance material from the roster of Klein Records, a German electronic label
    founded in 1996.  The collection holds together stylistically, as none of the
    nine artists breaks far from sofa-chill mode.  But how many more chill-out comps
    will I have to endure before I find any innovation?</p><p>
    The record begins in a slightly clubby mode with UKO's ""Automatic,"" a mid-tempo
    house tune with a spliffy veneer, excerpted from the band's 2001 self-titled
    album. Mika's ""Trampolin"" continues the clubby trend with a genteel breakbeat
    and a horrendous <i>Street Hawk</i>-period Tangerine Dream guitar line. So far,
    the droopy-eyed set have nothing to fall into their couches over. That's where
    the Sofa Surfers come in handy. With a track snipped from their forthcoming
    <i>Encounters</i> album, the Sofa Surfers give toney stoners an anthem with
    ""River Blues"" featuring the hemped vocals of Jeb Loy Nichols. Nichols' nasal and
    elongated vocal style works a treat when contrasted with a hi-energy rhythm
    track, such as the Ewan Pearson Maas disco remix of Nicols' ""Say Goodbye to
    Christopher."" But never has a singer described their own style more aptly as
    when Nicols sings about muddy water on this soporific track.</p><p>
    Albin Janoska tries to emulate Fat Jon the Ample Soul Physician with a
    head-bobbing instrumental hip-hop tune called ""Lem""-- soon to be adored by
    seldom-bathing, sandal-wearing Eurorailers. ""Lem"" has the perfect balance of
    low-end theory and quivering strings, garnished with a self-important, tinkling
    piano line.  Probably splendid after a eighth, if I'm feeling charitable. Markus
    Kienzl connects with the dub shacks of yore on ""Top Dog"" and scores the highlight
    of this disc. After unleashing echoes, Kienzl lets rip a bassline that should
    have turned up on Billy Cobham's plundered <i>Spectrum</i> LP. With minimal
    percussive adornment, Kienzl lets the bassline suck you in for five minutes.
    The only vocals here sound suspiciously sampled from Paul McCartney's count-in
    intro to the reprise of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" processed to
    sound like a really baked person fumbling their way to the number four.</p><p>
    Then comes a track from Seelenluft, a guy with a penchant for dressing up in
    bunny costumes for his public appearances.  Here, he chimes in with more fumbling
    nonsense on ""Manila,"" in which an uncredited vocalist hollers about dancing
    without a seatbelt before someone with an amateur urge to be John McLaughlin
    cuts her off with his ham-fisted display of plank-spanking. I do like ""Manila,""
    by the way.  Its goofiness redeems it, and if nothing else, it beats the piss
    out of the following track, ""Son of a Gun.""</p><p>
    ""Son of a Gun"" is by Mum (not the Icelandic applied IDM band, but some duo
    sorely lacking in dignity), and it's another contribution to that already
    swollen cliché, the hollerin' bluesman sampled and pasted into an incongruous
    mid-tempo house track. Mum at least altered the guitar-line to sound like some
    sort of oud or gourd monochord, and thereby making some statement about the West
    African roots of the blues. Or perhaps Mum thought that gourd-fashioned monochords
    somehow convey a hollerin' man's son-of-a-gun status more effectively that a
    plain ol' guitar.</p><p>
    Humbucker's ""Thrill Jockey,"" rather than traipsing into the mines of originality,
    opts to emulate Linkin Park.  And then, Lichtenberg's ""El Duke,"" with a mass of
    iconic Latin and spaghetti western signifiers, thankfully releases us from
    xFC-metal Valhalla.  But for all the cha-cha maracas and hornblasts, the song
    sounds nothing less than incidental music from a ""Star Trek"" fight sequence
    between James T. Kirk and some malevolent snaggle-toothed alien beastie. Should
    go down well at your next office party, then.</p><p>
<i>Sincerely Yours</i> (a title which must clearly be in doubt after this motley
    array of tracks) closes superbly with a new version of Seelenluft's ""Music for
    the Stars."" Hardly different from the blissful Ultramarine-as-a-Wurlitzer-outfit
    version that appeared on last year's <i>Synchronschwimmer-EP</i>, the track
    deftly highlights what Klein is capable of releasing when not bogged down in
    forgettable fodder for the trust-funded stoners-about-town.</p></div>"|1921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1921-sincerely-yours/|5.2|Paul Cooper

    Go.  Go ahead and try to find all the Boredoms-related projects.  I dare you.
    While you're at it, why don't you get another job, because most of the
    super-rare releases by these units will run you about $35 a pop.  Boredoms
    Marketing has got the whole supply-and-demand thing down, so why would they ever
    bother with distribution?  But that's overly cynical: as with most impulsively
    creative musicians, these people just never stop working.</p><p>
    
    Oh yes, there's also OOIOO.  The Boredoms connection here is drummer/trumpet
    player Yoshimi P-We.  The O-band is something of a solo project for Yoshimi,
    as she produces everything and writes most of the music (along with her partners
    Kyoto, Maki and Yoshiko).  They have three albums, and each one sounds
    progressively similar to recent Boredoms, with plenty of electronic fiddling and
    space-age sun-crash drum stomp-- <i>but</i>, with the major difference being
    Yoshimi doesn't take Eye's scenic route as a means, via extended warp drive
    exploration and jungle hunt.  OOIOO's journey always ends up closer to pop than
    Boredoms, with a penchant for new wave chic and boisterous, sing-song melodies.</p><p>
<i>Shock City Shockers 2</i> (on Eye's Shock City imprint) is comprised of
    remixes of tunes from the band's three previous albums, and one new tune, ""Open
    Your Eyes You Can Fly"" (which actually sticks out a little on this release, not
    featuring the electronic wizardry of the others).  The cast assembled to re-stir
    the mixtures is itself a mixture of old Bore cohorts and new characters, but
    there's something that nags me about the release in general.  It's not that the
    music isn't interesting to listen to-- there are lots of headphone-friendly
    details, and sonic logic games to play.  It's just that I can't help but think
    that, since OOIOO's albums always seemed at least a step away from greatness,
    and since they always seemed to be in debt to the recent Boredoms sound rather
    than an extension of it, injecting them with electric steroids is misleading.
    For me, most of the music on this album sounds better than the originals.  Take
    that as you will.</p><p>
    
    ""Tenkuteku Tune/Mountain Book"" (two tunes from the 2000 release <i>Gold and
    Green</i>) is a very nice way to begin the album.  We have a sine wave (courtesy
    of remixer Zak) floating over the top of the speakers, announcing the heady
    arrival of sunny, ambient flange-guitar and light synth.  It's conceptually
    similar to the last track from Boredoms' <i>Super Ae</i>, and placing such an
    offhandedly warm track at the beginning is a daring move.  How could you follow
    something so completely at ease?  Hmmm.</p><p>
    
    Later on, semi-hyperactivity rears its head.  Another, very different version of
    ""Mountain Book"" (remixed by Chari Chari) features a kinetic drum loop, somewhat
    like a techno Indian raga beat, and Yoshimi's echo-ridden vocals sent to all
    corners of the mix.  ""Asozan"" (from <i>Feather Float</i>) is given the rolling
    tom treatment by remixer Eye.  Beginning with restless marimba, all cartoonish
    Steve Reich motives and insistent pulse, it moves on to a fairly detached
    double-tracked Yoshimi vocal, again sent to various points.  ""Kinorokujyouressya,""
    reworked by frequent Bore-collaborator Kiyoshi Izumi, actually gets fairly close
    to straight techno with a bouncy, breakbeaten rhythm and all the hiccup glitch
    you could want on the dancefloor.</p><p>
    
    Other tracks are quite restrained: ""Unu"" (<i>Green and Gold</i>), remixed by
    Woodman, is heavy on the 80s drum machine and delayed tremolo guitar, and is
    virtually without vocals.  However, the beat is downplayed in favor of druggy
    atmospherics-- like the various atonal synthlines you can barely hear in the
    background-- but which nevertheless give the tune a very tangibly hazy quality.
    ""Be Sure to Loop"" (<i>Feather Float</i>), remixed by Tatsuki Masuko (of ASLN and
    Dub Squad fame) begins very similarly to the first tune: all warm, with bells,
    birds, and typically detached vocals.  After several minutes of this, the drums
    come in, and bingo!  It becomes like an outtake from <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i>,
    with the one-chord guitar vamp over pounding Neu drums and the omnipresent
    electric effects.  Someone in this camp should apply for a patent on this sound,
    because it's going to get ripped off very soon.</p><p>
    
    If pressed to place this album in a canon with other Boredoms' side projects,
    I'd reference three: firstly, Eye's DJ Pica Pica Pica release, with which
    <i>Shock City Shockers 2</i> shares an affinity for offbeat combinations of
    melody and rhythm (though this record could never rule a party like the Pica);
    secondly, the first <i>Shock City Shockers</i>, which was a collection of
    remixes of several bands' music; and thirdly, Boredoms' 1996 release <i>Super
    Roots 6</i>, with which it shares a command of ambience and the juxtaposition of
    simplistic structures and melodies with seemingly complex studio techniques.
    And while OOIOO's remix album is nice, I would recommend those records first.</p></div>"|6011.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6011-shock-city-shockers-2/|7.3|Dominique Leone

    upon a time portal manifested in the form of a wardrobe in Captain Sensible's
    cobbled and thatched suburban London cottage. What the band was doing there no
    one can say, but as they stepped inside the portal, making their way past row
    after row of paisley frocks and multi-hued, four-in-hand ties, they were
    transported to the year 1967, emerging from the WC of a downtown go-go club.</p><p>
    
    As luck would have it, the club's house band was absent that particular evening
    (all four had fallen ill with mononucleosis), so the lads in XTC had no trouble
    convincing management to allow them to take the stage. Having committed a fair
    share of the era's repertoire to memory, they (aided on drums by guitarist David
    Gregory's brother Ian, who happened to be with the band that fateful morn at the
    wardrobe) won the crowd over easily, and it wasn't long before they secured some
    studio time.</p><p>
    
    Christening themselves the Dukes of Stratosphear, and renaming themselves
    individually as Sir John Johns (Partridge), the Red Curtain (Moulding), Lord
    Cornelius Plum (David Gregory), and E.I.E.I. Owen (Ian Gregory), the band whipped
    up an EP's and an LP's worth of dainty psychedelic pop songs, inspired like no
    other time in their careers. The Dukes were truly of their era, yet wholly XTC--
    whimsical, bright, and trippy, but also wry, subtly sarcastic (even time travel
    couldn't change that), and sophisticated.  It was as if they themselves were
    inventing the very band that would later inspire and influence their proper
    albums.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, before they were suddenly and unexpectedly jerked back to 1985 in
    the middle of a rehearsal, the Dukes had the foresight to hide their session
    tapes under a stack of Pat Boone records at a local shop, and there they remained
    until XTC could pick them back up during the Thatcher administration.  The EP,
    <i>25 O'Clock</i>, was released later that year, while the remaining ten tracks
    came out two years later on the <i>Psonic Psunspot</i> LP. Both were eventually
    collected in their entirety on <i>Chips from the Chocolate Fireball</i>, which
    has been recently reissued by Virgin.</p><p>
    
    The above story must be what happened.  What else could explain this prime,
    vintage psychedelia, released during the decidedly un-psych mid-1980s?  What
    else could explain songs like ""Bike Ride to the Moon,"" with lines like, ""And
    we'll pack a tent 'cause it's cold at night/ And I'll share your sleeping bag
    if I might/ And might be a positive boon/ To protect you from the man in the
    moon""?  (The Small Faces couldn't have put it better.)  And how to explain the
    lack of much, if any, of the stench of 80s production values?</p><p>
    
    You might think this is a pure joke project on the order of Spinal Tap's ""Listen
    to the Flower People,"" but play this album alongside, say, Pink Floyd's
    <i>A Saucerful of Secrets</i> or the Zombies' <i>Odessey and Oracle</i>, and
    you'll find that, parody or not, it's a great collection of songs that more than
    measures up.</p><p>
    
    To put it bluntly, if you can only have one XTC album (by presidential mandate or
    something), this is the one. That's not a jab at XTC; they've delivered more than
    their fair share of outstanding releases in their day-- <i>English Settlement</i>
    and <i>Skylarking</i>, to name only two-- but there's always been a handful of
    mediocre songs on each album that could stay or go.  Not here.  All 16 are
    kaleidoscopic pop gems. It stands as a testament to the band's quirky genius
    that their loving parody/tribute side project just happens to be responsible for
    the best music they've ever made.</p></div>"|2475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2475-chips-from-the-chocolate-fireball/|9.0|Jason Nickey

    through the motions.  See, it's not that <i>Agit Itter It It</i> is all that
    bad; by anyone else's standards it's pretty excellent work. But after such a
    long, distinguished string of releases, culminating in last year's much-lauded
    <i>Idiology</i>, the five tracks contained here are kind of a letdown.  Most
    Mouse on Mars albums use the ideas of the previous one as a launching point
    for the exploration of new sonic territory.  And while the sounds used to
    construct the songs on <i>Agit Itter It It</i> do bear a strong resemblance to
    those on <i>Idiology</i> (and were likely created during the same sessions),
    they've clearly been made b-sides for a reason.</p><p>
    
    ""Milleader"" is somewhat interesting, finding Andi Toma and Jan St. Werner
    juggling jagged samples, bleating synths, programmed beats and assorted other
    noises with the expertise of first-class Powerbookers. Unfortunately, this isn't
    the case elsewhere. ""Untitled States Of"" is built around a distorted keyboard
    loop and a few repeated guitar riffs. As the song progresses, a bass part and
    sequenced percussion find their way into the mix while assorted layers of noise
    hover above.  Problem is, the beats holding it together are somewhat repetitive
    and generic (at least by the standard set in the duo's previous work), and the
    occasional pitchshifting and feedback fails to make that distinction between any
    old IDM track and Mouse on Mars mastery.</p><p>
    
    More telling still: by far the most interesting track on <i>Agit Itter It It</i>,
    entitled ""Moral Sack It,"" is no more than a minute long. A handful of trumpets
    enter and fade, leaving behind garbled electronic feedback in their wake like a
    path of slime following a snail, before giving way to the fractured beat that
    begins the next song. While little more than a transition, this is the only
    moment on the EP that truly demonstrates the kind of ingenuity present in the
    majority of Mouse on Mars' work.</p><p>
    
    In fact, the real highlight here is not the EP at all, but the live seven-inch
    that comes packaged with the disc's first pressing. Toma and St. Werner have
    gained a reputation as the best live performers in the electronic world,
    offering live instrumentation and an intriguing visual setup rather than relying
    on the standard guy/table/laptop scenario that characterizes most IDM shows. The
    addition of live drums, vocals from Dodo Nkishi, and other instrumentation to the
    usual laptops and sequencers allows these guys to reinterpret their work in ways
    that most electronic acts cannot. But they do more than just add a voice and
    manipulate some beat structures. The passion and energy driving the live version
    of ""Actionist Respoke"" here is undeniably human, replacing the alien aesthetic
    of the original with something different, yet oddly familiar. Though a live
    recording is typically a weak substitute for honest-to-god new music, these two
    cuts work better than anything presented on the EP.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps in the end, the best way to explain <i>Agit Itter It It</i> is the
    old-fashioned way: it's an EP.  And like most EPs, <i>Agit Itter It It</i>
    ultimately gets branded with the dubious ""for completists only"" stamp.  If you
    don't already have a vast collection of Mouse on Mars' proper albums, your
    well-earned funds will be better spent elsewhere.</p></div>"|5466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5466-agit-itter-it-it-ep/|7.2|David M. Pecoraro

Somewhere between east
    and west are the albums that neither pleasure your eardrums nor puncture them. At
    best, these albums are ordinary.  At worst, they're obnoxious.  Unfailingly,
    these records add little to the great panoply of the grand experience we call
    music. And in a world where 35,000 albums are released each year, they not only
    occupy vital shelf space, but their mere existence exacerbates the already
    challenging task of discovering true brilliance. They are anathema to our noble
    cause.  And as a result, we ought to attack them like coked-up mongooses.</p><p>
    
    Today, comrades, I am your mongoose, and Reclinerland is my field mouse.</p><p>
    
    From track one, vocalist and songwriter Mike Johnson is front-and-center. His
    songwriting style, not surprisingly, won't shatter your notion of consonance;
    the first track, ""Miss Haze,"" features Johnson and his acoustic guitar strumming
    lazily through a groundbreaking G-C progression. The progression doesn't change.
    By the end, Johnson is still strumming a measure of G. Then a measure of C. Then
    a measure of G. Then a measure of C. You get the idea.</p><p>
    
    Many arrangements on Reclinerland approximate the two-chord progression of ""Miss
    Haze,"" with Johnson self-consciously moaning in the foreground. Commonplace
    arrangements would be fine if Reclinerland was a melody-focused effort; but as
    far as I can tell, it's not. And if it is, someone needs to adjust the sharpness.</p><p>
    
    ""Pound Coins"" shows off another of Johnson's weaker points-- a smidge of
    tone-deafness. When he gets courageous and tries singing some high notes (the
    chorus, ""I walked along/ Mispronouncing all the funny names""), he's clearly just
    a bit flat. Some call it cute and endearing; I call it annoying. ""Pound Coins""
    isn't the only manifestation of the disability, either. It shows up, regrettably,
    on more than a few tracks (""19th Century Boy"" and ""Dirty and Clean,"" for example).</p><p>
    
    My campaign against mediocrity notwithstanding, can I say nice things about
    Reclinerland?  Sure, I can (sidenote: I can also say nice things about Lifehouse).
    In and of itself, and in the hands of an unbiased listener (read: not me), this
    stuff ain't bad. The lyrics are often poetic and appealingly witty, like this
    lyric from ""Eight"": ""I must have walked around in circles for a matter of days/
    I think I've broken the record for just standing in one place/ I think I've lost
    all the feeling in the right side of my brain/ It's hard to explain.""
    Unfortunately, they can also be as trite as the chord progressions, like the
    Jimmy V-inspired ""I want you so badly/ Don't give up, don't give up,"" from ""Meet
    Me Later in the File Room.""</p><p>
    
    In addition to strong lyrics, a few of the songs pull it all together, like
    ""Vegas Remains,"" which fingerpicks instead of strumming a chord progression
    and adds some sentimental schmaltz about how Johnson ""knows we're really just
    eight pages,"" whatever that means. Finally, the man strikes a consistent mood--
    sweet and thoughtful-- that I'm certain resonates with at least a few of the
    under-25 crowd.</p><p>
    
    There are good reasons I don't drive a Chevy Caprice Classic, eat Wonder Bread,
    live in Iowa, or root for Vinny Testaverde. For roughly the same reasons, you
    won't find me lavishing in the mellow hues of Reclinerland. A pleasant listen,
    but pleasant is about as far as I'm willing to go with this one.</p></div>"|6705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6705-reclinerland/|6.3|Brad Haywood

    Last year, former Go-Go's guitarist Charlotte Caffey and Anna Waronker, daughter of label guru Lenny Waronker
    and ex-frontwoman of That Dog, started up a record label dubbed Five Foot Two Records.  So now, after
    releasing a solo album this summer, Anna's done the rock world a great service by reissuing Redd Kross'
    long out-of-print 1987 classic, <i>Neurotica</i>-- and, what with Anna and Charlotte being married to the
    brothers Steve and Jeff McDonald, the core members of Redd Kross, the reissue shines with the light of
    careful consideration.</p><p>
    
    The album was recorded with producer Tommy Ramone (listed in the liner notes under his birthname, Tommy
    Erdelyi), but when their label Big Time folded soon after, the record's promotion suffered, leaving it
    relatively unheard by the masses, and to later become cult classic. As with most overlooked records, its
    power was channeled through other artists; these days, <i>Neurotica</i> is regarded as a prime influence on
    the early 90s grunge movement: Sub Pop once contracted the Posies' Jon Auer to remix the album for a
    re-release during the Seattle boom, but the project was not meant to be.</p><p>
<i>Neurotica</i> exuded a Janus quality found in the best pop music: it looked forward and equally embraced
    the past. It was the missing link between Big Star and the Pixies, a perfect blend of a 70s Saturday morning
    sugar rush and 80s California punk. Pop culture nostalgia was to Redd Kross what LSD was to the Butthole
    Surfers; their music was delivered with just as furious a passion, but their love for Beatles-esque pop
    harmony shone through as much as any punk sensibility, and their Kinks influences, entirely free of irony,
    served as lyrical substance over their powerful, hi-octane hooks.</p><p>
    
    Leading with its title track, lifted from the Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)""
    and complete with Liverpudlian count-off; <i>Neurotica</i> is definitive Redd Kross, coupling undulating
    melody and a sweetly harmonized bridge (remember bridges?) with a screaming chorus, and the result is as
    abrasive as it is catchy.  ""Love Is You"", the album's sole acoustic number, is as much a tribute to a girl
    as to love songs themselves; its tongue-in-cheek falsetto delivery sounds alternately comic and passionate.
    ""Peach Kelli Pop"", a Beatles-via-Badfinger rave-up, boasts the best swaggering vocals this side of Paul
    Westerberg, its lyrics illustrating just how far from the then ever-present Sunset Strip ethos Redd Kross
    were: ""Everybody take a ride/ In your mama's car/ Let's go to the Troubadour/ Pretend we're seein' stars/
    Man, we're cruisin' Hollywood/ Do you get the joke?/ Laughin' at all the assholes at the Rainbow/ Flyin'
    so high on coke/ What a joke.""</p><p>
    
    There's an innate sense of joy at the heart of <i>Neurotica</i>.  At times, the hardcore riffing teeters a
    bit too close to Hollywood hair metal, but when it's balanced by such undeniably fucking brilliant pop hooks
    and choruses, who's complaining?  The McDonald brothers' sense of melody and song structure is solely
    responsible for the album's charm, and in this world of haircuts and target marketing, it's good to be
    reminded that, no matter the era, every metropolitan underground produces phenomenal records-- even 1987
    L.A.</p></div>"|6730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6730-neurotica/|9.0|Kyle Reiter

I vividly
    recall sitting in front of the TV when I was a kid, entranced for hours by
    Twisted Sister, Def Leppard, and Quiet Riot videos.  And though I wasn't entirely
    sure about what was going on in front of my eyes, I was fascinated all the same.
    To think that there were places where grown men ran around in make-up and spandex
    and still managed to kick total rock ass.  These were guys that acted completely
    insane, yet took themselves seriously and were fawned over by women everywhere.
    As a child, it was like a portal into a strange parallel universe where all of
    my small town values were inverted.</p><p>
    
    Then there was the other breed of MTV musician: synth-pop guys who seemed more
    like real artist types and didn't seem to be concerned as much with making a
    fantastic testosterone-soaked spectacle of themselves as creating seductive and
    melodic music.  Naked Eyes, Human League, Talk Talk-- they seemed so cutting
    edge with their Roland synths and electronic drumpads, and the sounds they
    created were something entirely new, at least to popular music (sorry, I wasn't
    listening to Brian Eno and Kraftwerk when I was 10).</p><p>
    
    This was the type of stuff that really interested me.  But somewhere along the
    line, synth-pop began its long estrangement from melody, and electronica began
    to take over.  It started innocuously enough, but soon began incorporating more
    beat manipulation and studio effects until it was finally twisted into the form
    known today as IDM.  I miss those early days when the technology didn't rule the
    product, and I think it's time we saw some songwriters doing a little taking
    back.  It's time for a rebirth of synth-pop, wherein all the new innovations in
    electronic music are employed in the service of melody.</p><p>
    
    As my posterchild for this movement, I select Hood. (I also accept donations.)
    <i>Cold House</i> takes a fantastic batch of songs and intelligently mixes in
    cutting edge electronic elements a la Autechre and Nobukazu Takemura, a couple
    of west coast underground hip-hop artists, and some delicate backing arrangements,
    and creates one of the most innovative releases of the past year.</p><p>
    
    The biggest surprise on <i>Cold House</i> is the guest spots by Anticon MCs
    Dose-One and Why?.  I'm not sure how Hood hooked up with the San Francisco
    rappers, but their inclusion here was a brilliant decision.  The duo's scat
    lyrics and drum-n-bass delivery really temper the album, preventing it from
    becoming too soft at points.  Chris Hood's lead vocals aren't very inspiring,
    falling limply somewhere between Badly Drawn Boy and Bernard Sumner, but by
    mixing in the slit cut vocals, spoken word and psychobabble riffing, a perfect
    contrast is created between the them.</p><p>
    
    The album opens promisingly with ""They Removed All Trace That Anything Had
    Happened Here,"" a nice mix of delicate start/stop clicks, jangly guitar and
    tasteful cello arrangements.  The song splits the vocal sections, starting first
    with Chris Hood and then handing everything over to Dose-One, who drones over a
    repeated vocal loop whose compelling nature lies in its unintelligibility.  ""You
    Show No Emotion at All"" kicks off with an unimaginative scratchy beat, but soon
    picks up with nice trumpet and keyboard fills, revealing itself as the strongest
    track on the album that strictly features Hood's own vocals.</p><p>
    
    ""With Branches Bare""
    thrives on a distended drone that sounds clipped straight from Depeche Mode's
    <i>Violator</i>.  Halfway through, Dose-One hops in with his nasal tone and
    surreal lyrics: ""We spit in the pond to give the fish something to pray to/
    Sometimes the sunset doesn't want to be photographed/ We are no tigers in the
    picked-bone grasslands.""  But the album's standout comes with the closing track,
    ""You're Worth the Whole World.""  It's sung entirely by Dose-One over a low-mixed
    spoken track, a simple picked guitar progression, and hushed horn keyboards that
    lead in from the melancholy preceding track, ""Lines Low to a Frozen Ground.""</p><p>
    
    There are some misses in the middle of the album, like ""The River Curls Around
    This Town,"" a track that, while never really amounting to much, does end with
    some nice, richly atmospheric electronic gamelan sounds.  Indeed, all of the
    tracks on <i>Cold House</i>-- even the weaker ones-- contribute something of
    interest.  Take, for instance, ""I Can't Find My Brittle Youth,"" which might
    amount to little more than filler if not for the machine gun drumming that comes
    out of nowhere and closes the track like John Bonham at 78rpm.</p><p>
    
    Since their inception in 1994, Hood haven't been able to make up their minds
    what kind of band they want to be.  Over the course of their past four albums
    (not to mention their countless singles, EPs, compilation appearances, remix
    records, and collections), they've jumped indecisively from genre to genre,
    experimenting with shoegazer, straightforward indie rock, slowcore, and lo-fi.
    But with <i>Cold House</i>, Hood seem to have finally stumbled into a sound all
    their own, melding their countless influences into something totally unique and,
    at last, giving music fanatics and critics worldwide a reason to look forward
    to their future releases.  Let's hope the payoff is this good next time around.</p></div>"|3917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3917-cold-house/|8.5|Nathan Rooney

It's usually not even
    appropriate-- June of 44's punchy sound was far from the fluid motions of naval
    life.  Rachel's epic <i>The Sea and the Bells</i> must have marked a turning
    point, because since then, I admit to having heard a diffusion of its effects in
    Louisville-related projects like the Shipping News.  But then there are bands
    like Volta Do Mar, whose knife-sharp transmissions are more appropriate for a
    turn on the highway than the sea.  Maybe Steppenwolf's ""Born to Be Wild"" and
    Rush's ""Red Barchetta"" forever closed that road to the scene.</p><p>
    
    Victory at Sea argue otherwise on <i>Carousel</i>. The vibe on the trio's second
    full-length shifts without warning from warmth to biting cold, and on the most
    emotionally gripping songs, lyrical hints of road-trip imagery are tied to the
    breakup of a relationship.  It's dark rock in the vein of the Afghan Whigs; I'm
    thinking particularly of the guest vocals of Scrawl's Marcy Mays on ""My Curse.""
    Victory at Sea frontwoman Mona Elliott croons with a similar ache on the opener,
    ""Third Place.""  Her guitar meanders softly with shuffling percussion in the
    beginning as she sings, ""From one place to another, not one word to each other.""
    Drummer Fin Moore and bassist Mel Lederman weave rolling rhythms together,
    accelerating into a fiery chorus as Elliott admits that she can't repress memory
    forever.</p><p>
    
    Elliott's voice also reminds me of a sweeter Thalia Zedek, short of a few
    thousand packs of cigarettes.  Turns out to be an appropriate connection--
    Lederman played piano on Zedek's <i>Been Here and Gone</i>, and Zedek returns
    the favor in the company of a chorus of women for the conclusion of ""The Open
    Road.""  Moore proves his prodigious skill on this song, cycling through a series
    of rolls and crashes like an eight-armed Vedic god, his propulsion only enhanced
    by the brooding plod of the bass.  ""The sun hit the windshield like a rock from
    the sky,"" Elliott remembers, her only lyric in the song.  Then, the inevitable
    pause, patience, and the soaring chorus and climax that never fails to send a
    chill up my spine.</p><p>
    
    Whereas the previous songs begin at one destination and end entirely at another,
    ""The Blizzard of '78"" is Victory at Sea's most ""pop"" song.  Elliott's guitar
    chimes almost cheerily as she describes her street, buried in snow: ""The sun, it
    reflected from the ice to the windows and antennas from the cars shot through
    the new, higher ground; it was the last time I remember us together.""  Two
    verses, two choruses, and then a punchy melody at the ending that will leave you
    humming for hours but unsure whether you're happy or just damned miserable.  Too
    bad every song can't quite match that lyricism.  ""The Driver"" builds well, with
    a bluesy riff and shimmering cymbals.  Moore kicks in, transforming the piece to
    a stomping rocker, but Elliott loses steam: ""You can drive much faster than me/
    I am sometimes much older.""</p><p>
    
    But the rest of the songs lead the listener through more convoluted paths.
    ""Angel"" opens with a muted trumpet, and amidst the slow, tense rhythm, Elliott
    sings of ""wings homemade, crocheted out of hearts"" of the other jealous angels.
    The song cuts short before more can be revealed, but likewise, on the closer,
    ""Mermaid,"" she warns that ""they need water to breathe""-- but the water has
    spilled out.  You don't need to flesh out these curious figures to enjoy the
    turbulent drums and scraping feedback on this final track.  ""Remember,"" two
    tracks before, might have been a more appropriate closer, though, with Lederman's
    electric piano echoing like a bittersweet <i>Disintegration</i> ballad.  I worry
    that my words haven't done justice to this excellent album.  Just imagine a cold
    winter in the band's hometown of Boston, and all the icy intensity and seasonal
    weariness that might entail.  In case it wasn't obvious, this is one for the
    road.</p></div>"|8469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8469-carousel/|8.0|Christopher Dare

    You're a couple months shy of twenty years old, and though technically a college
    student, you can't remember the last time you attended a class. You spend your
    evenings driving back and forth to the well-known college town approximately
    45 miles to the east of your current residence for name musical events, or
    attend loud, sloppy punk rock shows at a dilapidated house two blocks from your
    own mediocre state university.  You know the place, right?  Some fall-down joint
    with a rotting front porch overflowing with rusty bicycles and mildewed sofas.
    You're not really sure who's paying rent, or if anyone is paying rent at all.
    The place smells like shit, and the show attendees drive you crazy with their
    politics and gratuitous displays of testosterone (chances are, if you're female,
    you're the clear minority), but it's better than bickering with your roommate
    over rent, and every now and then you have a really great time.</p><p>
    
    It's the messy nostalgia factor, and Karp's posthumous singles collection,
    <i>Action Chemistry</i>, reminds me of all the sweaty, drunken nights I spent
    trying like hell to not get trampled, and the times I surprised everyone (though
    mostly myself) when I loudly declared during the silence at the end of the show,
    ""Goddamn, that fucking rocked.""</p><p>
    
    I didn't see Karp in 1995. The bands I saw then were usually loud, but lacking
    both musical proficiency and a sense of humor. Karp was endowed with an impressive
    amount of both. Much has been made of their metal influences-- think the bastard
    child of the Melvins and Black Sabbath, occasionally joined by a hardcore-loving
    session musician with an affinity for uppers, Black Flag, and Animal from ""The
    Muppet Show""-- and as for the humor thing, well, it's hard not to like a band
    that adds a detail like this in the liner notes: ""Recorded with a live bear in
    the studio. That was tough.""</p><p>
    
    In fact, disliking this band is difficult when you find yourself raising the
    devil horns and headbanging in earnest to ""Turkey Named Brotherhood,"" with its
    dead-on <i>fucking metal</i> guitar line and unintelligible screamed vocals.
    It's hard not to laugh. And it's okay, because you know Karp is laughing with
    you.</p><p>
    
    In their day, Karp were notorious for their wrestling-wear, and lyrical allusions
    to <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> and the roller derby. They recorded three full-lengths
    for K, attracted some rather high-profile fans within the music community (Built
    to Spill's Doug Martsch has been spotted wearing Karp t-shirts on numerous
    occasions), and allowed their fans the pleasure of balls-out rock and roll
    absurdity without having to prefix the pleasure with ""guilty."" Consider the
    opener, ""Rowdy,"" the first track on Karp's last EP. A completely brutal, totally
    hilarious alcoholic older cousin of the Fucking Champs' progged-out meditations
    on the same genre, this track makes terrific use of its technical intricacy,
    never wiping the smirk off its face.</p><p>
    
    With Karp, the silliness factor tempers the bombast just enough that you can sit
    back on second listen and enjoy the hodgepodge of sounds beneath the noise
    without feeling like too much of a hesher. Both ""Dusk"" and ""Blue Blood"" employ
    the dirge-to-explosion, quiet/loud dynamics of the artier set, but allow for all
    the strutting metal affectations to seep through.  Likewise, the speed metal
    uproar of ""Gauze"" resolves itself into a raucous classic rock kind of conclusion,
    which would be completely preposterous if not for its defiantly lo-fi sound.
    The album fills out with a virtually unintelligible Black Flag cover, ""Nothing
    Left Inside,"" and the terrifically titled ""I'd Rather Be Clogging,"" with its
    slow-to-build, full-on guitar assault at the conclusion.</p><p>
<i>Action Chemistry</i> might lack subtlety, but that's sort of the point, isn't
    it?  I mean, if you're looking for breezy, complex pop songs, this obviously
    isn't the place to go.  This is not music for the Merlot crowd.  It's loud and
    unruly, and if they ever invent scratch-and-sniff CDs, this one would smell like
    the interior of a shitty dive the morning after an amateur cock-rock show. But
    the damn thing charmed me.  Something about undistilled rock without the bells
    and whistles.  Something about being sure these guys had a lot of fun doing this.
    Something about the way it makes me want to stock my pockets with cheap beer and
    go to a bad house show just to make sure I'm not missing anything really great.</p><p>

Obviously not to be fucked with. That one guy in the
    middle looks like the leader. He's just sitting there, smoking a cigarette,
    paying no attention to the fact that the two gentlemen standing to either side
    of him are about to kick someone's ass. There's a bear head on the wall. The guy
    with the plaid shirt and the big belt probably wrestled it to the ground with
    his own two hands, and slowly removed its head with a Swiss Army knife while the
    guy with his hands over his crotch cheered him on. These are the kind of guys
    who, if they saw you in a dark alley, would be too busy not giving a fuck about
    you to kick your ass.</p><p>
    
    Looking at the cover of <i>World of Gold</i>, it's fun to imagine that the boys
    of Nerves are true rustic badasses. Unfortunately, only one syllable in the
    phrase ""true rustic badasses"" really rings true about this CD.  <i>World of
    Gold</i> is an utterly unspectacular, plodding, and flat-out boring attempt at
    rough rock swagger. Though there are a few glimpses of inspiringly competent
    songwriting, this is an album that, at its very, very best, brings to mind
    phrases like ""inspiringly competent.""</p><p>
<i>World of Gold</i> opens with the infuriatingly uneven ""10 Feet Tall."" Starting
    with a riff that's about as fresh as Weezer's ""Hash Pipe,"" vocalist Rob Datum
    pulls out his best semi-retarded Iggy Pop affectations. It's certainly not awful,
    but it doesn't exactly grab your attention, either. After a while, some well-placed
    slide guitar hints at greater things, but that hint is never taken, and the song
    immediately slides back into its stale riffage.  And later, another shift towards
    more interesting songwriting is interrupted by a solo that sounds like it could
    have been played by a 12-year-old guitar student who's still discovering the
    wonders of the pentatonic scale.</p><p>
    
    ""Suffering Highway"" and ""Behind the Trees"" are similarly boring-- the former being
    absolutely unmemorable, and the latter being rather annoying.  Sloppy playing is
    fine, but sloppy slide guitar can lead to an unwanted foray into microtonal music.
    ""Behind the Trees"" closes with an absolutely unnecessary instrumental passage
    complete with vibraphones-- something that may or may not have been specified in
    their contract when they signed with Thrill Jockey. Tacking on vibraphones to
    clumsy, endlessly repetitive garage rock does nothing but emphasize the complete
    lack of original ideas that plagues this album.</p><p>
    
    I'll give them this much: occasionally, on a track like ""Take It,"" Nerves manage
    to pull off some sufficiently convincing sloppy rock.  Most of the time, though,
    when <i>World of Gold</i> does manage to grab your attention (which is rare), it
    isn't in a positive way. Other bands, like Clinic and the White Stripes, have
    managed to successfully adopt a similar aesthetic by bringing their own innovation
    and/or energy to the mix. But without the benefit of either of these, <i>World of
    Gold</i> is about as convincing as pyrite, and ten times as dull.</p></div>"|5750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5750-world-of-gold/|4.0|Matt LeMay

That's the nature of our icon-driven
    culture.  And for all the media glut, legitimate heroes-- the kind who do
    something more than sing, act or kick footballs-- are kind of hard to come by.
    I fell victim to such pop idolatry.  After letting go of the Madonna fascination
    around late sixth grade, I moved onto other idols, eventually settling on a
    couple of Kims (Deal and Gordon, to be exact) in high school. So I can sympathize
    with (International) Noise Conspiracy frontman Dennis Lyxzen, who wears his
    celebrity crush on his sleeve.  It's kind of endearing, really.  I mean, out of
    all the celebrities and quasi-celebrities in rock and roll today, he picked the
    ex-Nation of Ulysses/ex-Make-Up singer Ian Svenonius.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there's a fine line between idolatry and obsession, and I'm guessing
    the only thing stopping Lyxzen from going through the garbage outside the
    Svenonius household is geography. Sweden is quite a ways from D.C., and due to
    the corporate nature of air travel, I'm sure Lyxzen's anti-capitalist politics
    would hinder a jetsetting lifestyle.  Of course, the (International) Noise
    Conspiracy's ""Capitalism Stole My Virginity"" appears with some regularity on
    M2, so what the hell do I know?</p><p>
    
    Unable to follow up on his obsession in first person, present tense, Lyxzen seems
    to have arrived at the conclusion that his only choice is to Become Ian Svenonius,
    a goal easily enough achieved with the right combination of hair products and
    like-minded cohorts.  First, he would form a loud, angry band (Refused) that
    would release records with retro cover art and lengthy manifestoes as liner
    notes, and mediate the obvious similarity to Nation of Ulysses by throwing in
    some heavy metal and electronica for kicks.  That band would release two albums,
    and be followed up with another band, which would trade in the screaming and
    noise for danceable, soul-infused garage rock tunes. The new band would require
    members to wear tight, flared trousers, cultivate a highly stylized look and
    sound, and get a pretty girl (who had previously played in a feisty all-female
    band) with a complicated retro hairdo to join the team. And there you have it:
    the Make-Up.  Erm, I mean, the (International) Noise Conspiracy.</p><p>
    
    The sound of these two bands is so totally similar, I double-dare you to listen
    to the title track on <i>The First Conspiracy</i>, the Noise Conspiracy's recently
    released compendium of early EPs, and see if you can't imagine an obscure Make-Up
    tribute band covering a rejected track from <i>Destination Love</i>. It's all
    there: Lars Stromberg playing pseudo-James Canty with spare, throwback guitar
    hooks; the simple, yet funky rhythm section; and of course, Lyxzen's occasionally
    squealing delivery.</p><p>
    
    Simply put, that's the formula, and you'll find little variance on any of <i>The
    First Conspiracy</i>'s twelve tracks, save an occasional chanted sing-along
    (""T.I.M.E.B.O.M.B."") or a foray into slightly punker territory (""Black Mask"").
    In fact, the only factors saving this disc from being a total rehash of all your
    favorite Make-Up moments are the following: 1) for better or worse, James Brown
    vocalizing doesn't translate so well to Swedish; 2) there's a keyboard; and
    3) the lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Indeed. If you like your music heavy on the anarcho-communist polemic, then
    certainly this is the band for you. For example, in ""The Sin Crusade,"" Lyxzen
    squeals, ""Noise, in this case, the idea of the subversive sounds that could, in
    difference with the regular pop group, serve as an attack against music's
    function as the spectacle, the only way we can even begin to play the
    revolutionary game.""  That's a song lyric, folks.  Lyxzen gets technical in
    ""I Swear If U Do"" (which even <i>looks</i> like a Make-Up title) by including
    footnoted dates and a quotation from Engels' <i>Within the Body of the Song</i>.</p><p>
    
    Truly, <i>The First Conspiracy</i>'s lyric sheet would function beautifully as
    a sly parody of political rock music.  Problem is, they're dead serious-- in
    flared pants-- and the only thing I can figure is that the sense of humor of
    the Noise Conspiracy's D.C. idols was lost in translation.  Also, to say this
    political earnestness is something of a killjoy would be a massive understatement.
    In the end, you find yourself giggling at the lyrics and wondering if such
    imitation isn't, well, kind of sad.</p></div>"|4111.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4111-the-first-conspiracy/|2.9|Alison Fields

    but is nevertheless creating and recreating at a rapid pace that rejects even
    the most sincere attempts at canonization.  The members of this party interact
    and exchange various phenomena without a shred of cautious foresight, and what
    results is more fruitful and volatile and reactive than any one elements could
    ever have been alone.  I imagine the streets in Koenji must be crawling with
    taste police on the lookout for illegal cross-pollination and concept-ridden,
    incestuous marriages; that the kids who are voluntarily dropping out of the
    material world for riskier exhibitions must live in constant paranoia that their
    night lives will be used against them when the number-crunching begins.  Or
    worse-- that nobody will listen when it's their turn to play.</p><p>
    But unbeknownst to their more conservative brethren, who would settle for the
    Occidental Tourism of Western Pop as scripture, these kids, cousins and artful
    clergymen are making something new under the Empire of the Sun.  This is not
    manufactured, and it's certainly not criminal, but it is, in fact, quite
    extraordinary. These wildly informed noise shamans, in the age of supposed
    information sharing, have beaten American democratic spirit at its own game.
    I'm talking about unselfish art and the exchange of ideas.  I'm talking about
    today's Japanese independent music.</p><p>
    Okay, so maybe I romanticize this stuff a bit.  But it's not for any love of
    melodrama, as I can assure that I enjoy reading about someone's obscure fetishes
    about as much as you do.  No, the musicians working underground back east pique
    my interest mostly due to renegade originality and purity of expression in the
    face of drastic underexposure.  For example, when I heard the story of drummer
    Tatsuya Yoshida's first rehearsal with his then un-named band, wherein the
    guitarist didn't show up and he decided to go with only himself and a bassist
    for the subsequent 15 years as Ruins, I took notice.  Or, when I read about how,
    after more than a decade of praise from the alternative press, Boredoms frontman
    Yamatsuka Eye still doesn't think his band plays well enough, doesn't understand
    why people call his music ""noise,"" and is constantly striving for the next new
    sound, I was struck.  These are stories of people who refuse to accept the
    mundane, practical or given.  It's easy to romanticize a scene that offers no
    guarantees of fame, and yet whose members are as in love with their art as any
    detached fanatic.</p><p>
<i>Japanese Independent Music</i> is an ambitious undertaking by the French label
    Sonore.  Although there have been samplers of experimental Japanese music before,
    it's never been easy for Western audiences to find information about the music.
    Sonore head Franck Stofer packaged this album with a book of the same title that's
    a virtual godsend to anyone who was ever frustrated trying to find out about a
    band like Ruins.  The book is an encyclopedic reference, with an extensive,
    alphabetical listing of hundreds of fringe Japanese bands/artists, featuring
    full discographies, essays on various sub-scenes, and even an appendix with
    label addresses and contact info.  And best of all, it's in English, unlike the
    first French-only edition.  I'll let you find it on your own-- and you will, if
    this is your bag-- but for now, let's talk about the most important stuff: the
    music.</p><p>
    The CD features tracks from 18 of the most important contributors to Japan's
    independent music scene.  It covers a lot of ground, conceptually speaking:
    modern-classical, avant-prog, IDM, neo-trad Japanese folk, noise, punk--
    basically, anything John Zorn has been preaching since he started his
    inter-continental commute in the 80s.  It's a much more varied collection than
    others such as <i>Bad Sun Rising</i> or <i>Tokyo Flashback</i>, and perhaps most
    comparable to the excellent double-disc Virgin UK release <i>Cosmic Kurushi
    Monsters: Tokyo Invasion Vol. 1</i> from 1996. This stuff goes out on a limb,
    and be forewarned that a little artistic levity is required before entering.</p><p>
    Standout tracks for me include Gaji's ""Trippin' Under a Changin' Sphere"" and
    Hoppy Kamiyama's ""Fantasm B.""  Gaji is an experimental punk band from Tokyo
    who actually started out as kind of an eclectic mix of Wire, krautrock and
    Boredoms, but here sound much more focused and traditionally wound.  The band's
    female vocalist, Hasegawa Yuko, reminds me of a less girly Patty Donahue, but
    the band's sound here is full-on aggressive, totally assured poly-punk-- think
    Minutemen crossed with 80s King Crimson.  Too many reference points?  How about
    moving on to Kamiyama, and about a dozen more?</p><p>
    Hoppy Kamiyama's tune is a great representation of many of his favorite musical
    outlets: Bartok-influenced chamber classical, horror soundtracks, Rock in
    Opposition, and no wave.  The guy has seemingly been around forever, and covers
    a lot of bases in his 4\xBD minutes on this CD.  If you never have the fortune of
    hearing some of his work, you'll probably run into him indirectly when
    investigating the scene anyway because he's head of the excellent God Mountain
    label (Pugs, Koenji-Hyakkei, Optical*8, Demi Semi Quaver), as well as producer
    for dozens of acts elsewhere.  He's also worked with Zorn and Maceo Parker in
    the West, so I wouldn't try to hide from him.</p><p>
    Electronic music gets its props here, too, as tracks by Wono Satoru, Yuko
    Nexus6, Furudate Tetsuo and Nakamura Toshimaru demonstrate that not all of
    the best new computer-generated madness is coming out of Chicago or Germany.
    Nakamura's track is straight sine-wavey stuff, produced entirely from a mixing
    board with no inputs.  Satoru's ""Allego"" was done using only a phonograph plexus,
    while Yuko Nexus6's minimalist ""N.S.K.K."" sounds as if created more from the
    muse of a computer scientist than an experimental turntable magician.   Lest
    these descriptions sound a bit technical, Furudate's piece brings in a little
    royal courtyard sturm-und-drang to spice up its strains of pounding sheet metal
    and reverberated signal beacons.  I suppose some of this stuff would work well
    in a <i>Mad Max</i> movie, but I'm just using it to get pumped about going back
    to work tomorrow.</p><p>
    There are some ""big"" names here as well, like Ruins, Keiji Haino and Acid Mothers
    Temple, but I don't want to bore you with the music the good <i>Fork</i> has been
    (possibly over-)hyping these last few months.  Or, it could be that I just don't
    want to go on like a crazed fan, forcing this stuff down your throat.  Instead,
    here's something I read from an interview with avant-hero Oshima Dan: ""I think
    that Japanese indie music is based on absolutely absurd spirit. I mean, it's
    built on nothing, it contains no culture.""  On the one hand, I think Dan
    undersells the impact this music has on its audience, because I can tell you
    first-hand that whatever the music is built on is certainly weightier than most
    anything else I've heard.  However, he has a point; this is music that is not of
    a culture, but rather appears to be creating one.  Whatever scenes you subscribe
    to, ask yourself how many of them could remain as vital when even the chance to
    hear the music was an obstacle.  How many could overcome little-to-no
    documentation or familiarity with the principal actors involved?  Right now, I
    can only think of one, and if you blink, you could miss it.</p></div>"|1987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1987-japanese-independent-music/|8.5|Dominique Leone

    EP.  There's not much to it-- some one-handed piano, a single synthesizer swell,
    and programmed drums. The spare beauty of the piano melody is certainly to be
    admired (it's one of many Aphex tracks inspired by Satie), but the real kicker
    for me has always been the beats. ""Flim"" looms large in my personal listening
    history because it's the first track I remember hearing where the percussion
    carries the bulk of the emotional content.  Its drums are loaded with tension,
    constantly feeling as though they might be moving just a bit too fast for the
    tune, in danger of falling over themselves. But they never lose their footing
    and continue to drop into place with precision, providing serious catharsis at
    the end of every 16th bar.</p><p>
    
    I've come across music where the feelings hinge on the percussion since I first
    discovered ""Flim,"" but I've not heard a band pursue the notion as relentlessly
    over the course of an album as Boston's the Grace Period. <i>Dynasty</i> is an
    album of subtle touches and rare warmth, filled with interesting melodic
    fragments and memorable sounds. But the drums are what make these songs special.
    Just as Alan Sutherland of Land of the Loops used live bass to provide both the
    foundation and sonic signature for his work, Grace Period main-man (and former
    <i>Pitchfork</i> writer) Chris Ott's drums are the heart and soul of this
    record.</p><p>
    
    ""Paris Au Printemps"" begins the album with a sexy bit of French dialog, and then
    one spoken line is plucked and set into looping motion. The drumming on the track
    is loose and relaxed, like it's guiding the listener slowly into a dream, a
    feeling enhanced by the velvety synthesizer chords. Thick, round keyboard drones
    are a recurring theme throughout <i>Dynasty</i>, serving as a blurry pastel
    background for the brush strokes of the percussion. ""Best of Boston"" begins with
    some of the warmest such drones on the record, which are in contrast to the crisp
    cymbal hits that set the track in motion. ""My Girlfriend"" is one of the few
    songs to plainly incorporate an outside sample, looping a section of a wordless
    three-note falsetto vocal and burying it beneath determined drumming and a looped
    acoustic guitar pattern, all to sublime effect. The militaristic rudiments that
    make up the rhythm of ""Et in Arcadia Ego"" compliment the coldest synths on
    <i>Dynasty</i>, providing some interesting contrast to the generally congenial
    tone.</p><p>
    
    Occasionally, the Grace Period's experiments with drum texture don't quite hit,
    as on the bombastic Bonham-isms that encompass the annoying ""Boring Arial
    Layout."" But these occasional misfires aren't what keep me from loving this
    album. <i>Dynasty</i> comes up a bit short for me in its over-reliance on the
    looped fragment as a basis for composition. These songs are evocative,
    well-crafted and emotional, but some of them are also too repetitive, a quality
    with potential to limit repeat playability in the distant future.</p><p>
    
    For the time being, though, I am digging this record. It's fair to lump the
    Grace Period with sample-driven outfits on labels like Slabco or My Pal God, but
    the similarity is primarily in the mode of production. There's nothing even
    remotely kitschy about <i>Dynasty</i>. You never get the feeling that somebody
    spent 500 hours in front of the television, flipping channels with one hand with
    a finger on the VCR's record button. The Grace Period is softer, more reflective,
    and ultimately more human; what voice samples there are might be recordings of
    friends who happened to be hanging around. Instead of a pop culture travelogue,
    the Grace Period feels more like a diary-- one open-ended enough to apply to
    anybody.</p></div>"|3537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3537-dynasty/|7.4|Mark Richard-San

    last-name band-naming is <i>the</i> secret formula for instant success and
    stardom. The proof speaks for itself: Winger, Nelson, Bonham, Dokken, Danzig,
    and Dio, to name only a few. For over 20 years, I counted on my last name,
    Haywood, as my ticket to celebrity.</p><p>
    
    That is, until a group of bastards from Brooklyn decided to lift my birthright,
    the righteous moniker of my forthcoming avant-metal band, Haywood. My band would
    have featured me, Brad Haywood, on vocals and autoharp, along with my sister
    Kelly on bass flute, and my dad chopping wood.  I was also toying with a way to
    work some midgets into the equation, with my mother as coordinator. Awesome!</p><p>
    
    But alas, t'was not to be.  I've known it since 2000, when my friend Bradly
    (with no ""e""-- how weird is that?  My friend is a fucking adverb) picked up a
    copy of Haywood's second LP, <i>Men Called Him Mister</i>, from a D.C.-area
    bargain bin. I listened, expecting little, but the more I heard, the more I knew
    my dream was not only in hot water; it was plainly a bad idea. It was best to
    leave the Haywood legacy to men who, although not Haywoods by birth, were
    Haywoods at heart. Or at least had talent.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately for the world, the Haywood legacy consists of only three LPs. The
    latest of those, <i>We Are Amateurs, You and I</i>, was released in late 2001
    after the band split to pursue other projects. It's an excellent work of catchy
    indie-pop, reminiscent of Built to Spill, with a profoundly personal and
    sentimental side.</p><p>
    
    ""Button Up Buttercup"" is so good it almost burns itself onto your next CD mix.
    The tune employs three or four hyper-melodic guitar hooks, the best of which
    oscillates with a stiff drumbeat to lead stunningly into the chorus. It would
    find itself subject to the rarely used ""repeat"" function on your disc player if
    it weren't for its follow-up, ""Six Stars,"" a simple, sentimental love crush (""I
    adore just/ Your gorgeous eyes"") delivered with passionate, blurry-eyed
    authenticity.</p><p>
    
    Competing with ""Button Up Buttercup"" for top-honors on the disc is ""Don't Go
    Breaking (My Heart),"" which takes a heartfelt turn with group-sung vocals.
    These are contrasted with percussive instrumental bridges, the last slowing to
    a near-complete halt before firing back into a final power-chorus and
    instrumental section. In less capable hands, it might be boring, but Haywood's
    musicianship and maturity make it a powerful thing.</p><p>
<i>We Are Amateurs, You and I</i> boasts the talent and focus of a band that's
    played together for nine years. The final document sounds like both a personal
    diary and a thank-you note, a last shot from a band in their prime. They have
    done my family name proud.  Memories of the elementary school perils of my
    surname prompt me to ask one final question: ""Hey, would you guys come back?""</p></div>"|3782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3782-we-are-amateurs-you-and-i/|8.2|Brad Haywood

    vocal affectations, how they bite the Velvet Underground's style, and how
    horribly inauthentic the whole thing is. Maybe it's because the Strokes only
    seem to have one influence.  (Don't bother the pomo collage known as ""influences""
    on the friendly AMG cheat-sheet, by the way.)  But anyone with a cool uncle, or
    anything beyond a radioland interest in music, has listened to the Velvets.
    Many, many people have attempted to imitate them before, and many more will do
    it in the future.  It's a moot point.</p><p>
    
    The Still don't sound like the Velvet Underground.  Well, kind of.  They have
    the garage-chic veneer, the occasional Cale-like passages of pure sound, and the
    melancholy sneers of a conflicted songwriter.  It's a comparison that gets tossed
    around from time to time, and one that should come as no surprise to bandmembers
    Alex Hacker, Doug Bailey and Greg Pavlovcak, even if it's not 100% accurate.</p><p>
    
    But let's do a little background work: after Hacker's departure from the Ropers
    in 1996, the once-Slumberland darlings released an album with drummer Mike
    Donovan, and then promptly disbanded.  The Still is basically a reformation of
    the Ropers, and it follows the letter of the day-- it's more mature and colored,
    and its songwriting is less willfully ""pop"" than before.  They've even signed to
    a new label: Trevor Holland's pulCec.</p><p>
<i>Nectar</i> is the first result of the Ropers' maturation, and it takes every
    opportunity to genuflect to the band's various influences, which draw primarily
    from wistful shoegazer and shameless mid-90s Britpop.  The opener, ""Sunshine,""
    is a reluctant ""Seagull,"" only Doug Bailey's vocals crackle above a shoddy mix
    of Echo and the Bunnymen strings and descending basslines.  His voice is
    singularly unfit for the largeness of the mix-- though Amy Domingues theoretically
    doubles the lower frequency output on cello, Bailey always comes off weak and
    without inflection.</p><p>
    
    Further play only proves this point as a dominant issue, as borderline badass
    guitar lines like the one on ""Wavelength"" are castrated by Bailey's
    shy-guy-turned-rock-star act.  This kind of posturing might be fine for the
    scratch vocals and okay for rehearsals, but it's unforgivable in the studio and
    an act of treason live.  Let's hope Bailey takes a few shots of his namesake
    before going under the lights.  That might be a good show.</p><p>
    
    What's sad is that most of these songs are great, but overshadowed by blatant
    flaws.  The exception is ""Ready Now,"" a track which simply begs to give the
    Strokes a run.  The extra ten seconds spent on production and songwriting really
    here show through, uplifting the already delicious pop goodness.  The Spacemen
    3-ish melody and sentiments of ""Turned Around,"" however, aren't so lucky.  While
    potentially expansive, they unfortunately surrender to mediocrity with rushed
    phrasing, keys pushed too far back, and endless distortion which strip the song
    of its poignancy.  All this, of course, points to Trevor Holland, whose lo-fi
    aesthetics work for bands whose main strengths are unity and the desire to do
    things a bit dirty.  The Still, though, don't need to fit the mold of modern
    primitivism, as their VU view came through an English mirror-- a lovely, pastoral
    mega-multitrack recording would serve them where their current make-up doesn't.</p><p>
    
    The problem is the Still are too caught up in idol-worship with their eyes on the
    highest indie pop prize: Strokes-ification.  Their songwriting, instrumental
    bravado, and dreams far outmatch their production and singer.  The future will
    hold one or more of the following: a) Bailey will get the balls to finally front
    the band; b) the Still will hire a new singer; or c) the band will take a ripened,
    less reactionary stance and enjoy a renewed opportunity for Bailey to set the
    vocals right.  Or, of course, they may just go down as another unrecognized band
    who kinda sounds like the Velvet Underground.  If that turns out to be the case...
    next, please.</p></div>"|7517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7517-nectar/|6.2|Daphne Carr

    overpriced, yet aesthetically pleasing apartment, I must fess up to my undeniable
    attraction to the charming, unnecessary, and impractical. I'm a form over
    function kinda girl all the way around. So what's a subzero temperature and
    frequently compromised plumbing in an apartment where the moldings and doorframes
    are really cool, right?</p><p>
    
    Well, in terms of being aesthetically pleasing, the charm factor on Sub Pop's
    new Kinks tribute album, <i>Give the People What We Want</i>, hits just
    slightly higher than a Sub Pop promotional compilation.  Kinks covers have lost
    a lot of their appeal since people started covering ""Come Dancing"" like it was
    going out of style.  (Don't do it.  For the love of God, if you're in a band,
    don't.  I cannot stress this enough.)</p><p>
    
    What's great about this tribute, though, is that it effectively merges all of
    the above into a somewhat uninspired, though truly weird amalgamation that
    eviscerates the competition by providing you with what you never even thought
    about wanting.  For instance: a quiet, heartfelt rendition of ""Waterloo Sunset,""
    as performed by the Fastbacks.  It's the most charmlessly charming, utterly
    superfluous album I've heard in a while. And to get right to the point: if you
    consistently answer the question ""do you really need that?"" with a resounding
    ""yes,"" consider this compilation a possibility.  If not, you should probably
    skip the rest of this review and pay your phone bill.</p><p>
    
    Now that I've isolated the spendthrifts, please understand that I'm not making
    an argument for this record's kitsch value.  That would be something different--
    something less premeditated, and probably less bizarre.  But where most tribute
    albums suffer from a hyper-obsession with remaining true to the original artist,
    this compilation makes a strong case for the offbeat.  Some portion of this could
    be attributable to the featured artists (I mean, when you think Murder City
    Devils, the Kinks aren't exactly next in line for free association).  But this
    is a good thing.  I'm all for the eclectic.</p><p>
    
    Still, that well over half of the artists on this album have at least semi-formal
    connections to Sub Pop makes the record resemble someone's creative idea for a
    promotional sampler-- ""Hey, people really like the Kinks.  This might, in a
    roundabout way, sell more Murder City Devils records."" On paper, it looks like
    a good idea. One can imagine a Post-It on a desk in a certain Seattle office
    reading: ""Don't forget the punk rock cover of 'Come Dancing.' The kids love
    those.""</p><p>
    
    However, under careful scrutiny, the notion sort of deconstructs itself. Sure,
    the Kinks are great, but that doesn't change the fact that the Murder City
    Devils' take on ""Alcohol"" (done up in the old Killdozer style) is mostly
    unappetizing.  Both Mudhoney and Love as Laughter contribute tracks; both sound
    like an afterthought.  With Mudhoney, one expects a certain amount of laziness,
    but Love as Laughter's ""Tin Soldier Man,"" recorded by only half of the band,
    is a real disappointment after the great <i>Sea to Shining Sea</i>.</p><p>
    
    In fact, some of the better moments on <i>Give the People What We Want</i> are
    either foregone conclusions or way out in left field.  For example, garage-rockers
    the Fallouts offer a perfectly credible version of ""The Man He Weeps Tonight.""
    Conversely, the Makers' compelling ""Strangers"" comes off a bit like the bastard
    child of Neil Diamond and Iggy Pop (uh, it's really much, much better than that
    sounds).  Elsewhere, the Posies' Jon Auer and singer/songwriter Heather Duby
    contribute mellow, adult-alternative covers of ""Fancy"" and ""The Way Love Used to
    Be.""  And Nikol Kollars' R&amp;B; rendition of ""I Go to Sleep"" is remarkable only for

    To say that <i>Give the People What We Want</i> is predominated by filler
    wouldn't be completely fair.  Some of the filler isn't bad; just predictable
    (the Young Fresh Fellows, the Congratulators).  And of course, the artists shied
    away from the obvious (no one covers ""Lola"") without completely avoiding the
    predictable pratfalls (the punk rock version of ""Come Dancing,"" by a band called
    the Briefs who tragically didn't get my memo on <i>not doing that</i>).</p><p>

    which has given them enough time to hob-knob about the industry and pool together
    enough guest musicians for their latest effort, <i>Creating Patterns</i>, a kind
    of ""Chicken Soup for the Soul for Those That Gotta Get Their Minds Together.""
    Apparently feeling pent-in by their simple designation as drum-n-bass luminaries,
    Dego and Marc Mac have decided to spread their ambitions far and wide, creating
    an album that harkens back to Stevie Wonder's <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i>
    and Herbie Hancock's <i>Head Hunters</i>.</p><p>
    4 Hero are obviously wizards in the studio; the production values and sounds
    they create are sterling.  However, the topical concerns of <i>Creating Patterns</i>
    bring to mind an incredible array of -ism's-- eastern mysticism, religious
    syncretism and socially progressive, get-yer-ass-off-the-couch pragmatism, to
    name a few-- that come close to derailing the musical content.  With nearly 30
    years separating us from <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i>, the conceits contained
    there simply sound naïve; here, they border more on the self-indulgent.</p><p>
    My interest in <i>Creating Patterns</i> was largely piqued by the UK hype
    surrounding its release and its designation in more than one place as
    album-of-the-year.  I was prepared to follow suit 30 seconds into the first
    track, ""Conceptions,"" when I was taken aback by the gorgeous mix of layered
    strings, sitar, and soprano sax over a loping bassline that wafted from the
    speakers like a shower of perfumed lotus petals.  I eased back in my chair and
    let myself float away, prepared never to come back, except possibly as a
    Bodhisattva gushing praise for my new favorite album.  But what followed was
    a let-down.  Aside from ""Conceptions,"" there's really only one other track on
    the album that took me hook, line and sinker: ""Les Fleur."" And even this song
    lost most of its luster when it revealed itself as a nearly note-for-note
    replica of Minnie Riperton's gorgeous song of the same name.</p><p>
    My experience with <i>Creating Patterns</i> was consistently disrupted by lyrical
    contributions I found hard to swallow.  ""Time"" features the ubiquitous Ursula
    Rucker spoiling a perfectly good arrangement with her open-mic-night voyage of
    spiritual conflict, which is only enlightening insofar as it displays how much
    more convenient it is for a poet to ransack the Old Testament than to try to say
    something original.</p><p>
    Mark Murphy's performance on ""Twelve Tribes"" is far more convincing and I loved
    his delivery.  But it also includes lines like, ""Twelve, the infinite number/
    All of us are twelve once and then never the same/ Twelve opens the eyes and the
    mind/ We learn more between the ages of twelve and eighteen than we ever again
    experience in learning/ The Mayan calendar ends in 2012/ What, then?/ Hmm?  Hmm?""
    I assume we're supposed to find this incredibly mind-blowing.  Maybe after
    smoking a few bowls. (""2012!  Dude, what a bummer!  We'd better have this all
    smoked by then-- we don't want it to go to waste."")  If you can ignore the
    silliness, though, it's a great track that rivals Medeski, Martin and Wood's
    ""Whatever Happened to Gus?""</p><p>
    ""Another Day"" features Jill Scott, and it's kind of odd hearing a woman that
    sounds like Anita Baker sing about how, although she'd rather stay home and play
    video games than go to work, by god, she's going to push forward and make
    something of herself.  ""Unique"" turns things around with Brazilian-tinged
    instrumentation and Portuguese vocals, and ""The Day of the Greys,"" an epic,
    folk-inflected number, keeps the record riding at a passable level.  ""Hold It
    Down"" might even appeal to fans of Lauryn Hill and straight ahead R&amp;B.;  But then
    there are the numerous unpleasant excursions into jazz fusion like ""Twothesme,""
    ""Golden Solitude,"" and ""Eight,"" which grind away repetitively to the point of a
    mind-numbing, next-song-please anxiety.</p><p>
<i>Creating Patterns</i> left me disappointed, and feeling that the album could
    have amounted to much more.  A shame, because 4 Hero are creating some of the
    most startling studio sounds I've come across.  The string arrangements that back
    the tracks here remind me of the golden age of 70s soul, smooth and well-crafted.
    The beats are crisp and catchy, and the scope of the album is ambitious, even
    though, in the end, that ambition proves to be its biggest weakness.  I'll be
    looking forward to their next effort, hoping they decide to trust their own
    talents and go it alone.</p></div>"|3164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3164-creating-patterns/|7.0|Nathan Rooney

    elementary school, as secondary schools usually don't have the time or resources
    to force every kid to partake in music each year.  What usually happens is that
    kids will go through some kind of ""general"" music class wherein they learn to
    sing ""Kumbaya"" in solfege, or organize a performance of ""Jingle Bell Rock"" on
    recorders and triangles for the PTA meeting.  And people wonder why arts programs
    are increasingly being cut from public school curriculum.</p><p>
    
    There are a number of theorists out there with interesting ideas about how we
    should be teaching our kids about music.  German composer Carl Orff had an
    interesting idea about education: ""Since the beginning of time, children have
    not liked to study. They would much rather play, and if you have their interests
    at heart, you will let them learn while they play.""  Most of you probably had
    some kind of Music Ed experience-- think about it, and consider if it seemed
    based on anything close to a concept of ""play.""  I remember a lot of being forced
    to sing ""Freres Jacques,"" and I can hardly blame the kids who knew it wasn't cool
    to do that stuff.  It wasn't, and I doubt anyone, teacher included, got anything
    important out of that stuff.</p><p>
    
    In 1976, Canadian music teacher Hans Fenger was inspired by Orff's concept, and
    decided to commence on a project involving students from several elementary
    schools in the provincial Langley region, British Columbia.  By his own admission,
    Fenger knew little about teaching music to children, but trusted the kids' grasp
    of what they liked enough to arrange this project.  Chiefly, this project
    involved recording a group of students in a school gym on two-track, performing
    their favorite tunes and playing instruments developed by Orff (for use in his
    Schulwerk program).  The recordings were never supposed to be widely distributed,
    until producer/author Irwin Chusid (<i>Songs in the Key of Z</i>) heard them,
    and the decision was made to make them available worldwide.  So, in the end, a
    completely local, unpolished music education project is now at the fingertips of
    serious music fans everywhere.  Strike one up for Canadian taxpayers.</p><p>
    
    Of course, if you were skeptical that the results could match the inspired
    enthusiasm, I wouldn't blame you.  The thing is, these people put so much joy
    and interest (trust me, having interested kids is never a given for teachers)
    into the proceedings, that they make this CD good by sheer force of will.  The
    opener, Paul McCartney's ""Venus and Mars/Rock Show,"" captures the ridiculous
    amount of feeling for which the kids have for this music.  And they sound good,
    too!</p><p>
    
    ""Good Vibrations"" features bells and acoustic guitar (standards in Orff's program),
    and adds a little authenticity to the mix by bringing in the sleigh bells like
    Brian used to do.  The singing and arrangement are actually a tad on the
    melancholy side, much more restrained and poignant than you'd think a group of
    grammar schoolers would be capable of.  In fact, throughout the album, the
    prevailing mood is often quite somber.  Perhaps, as Fenger postulates, the
    students loved songs that evoked loneliness and sadness, or perhaps they just
    felt so at ease playing music that they couldn't be bothered with being hyper
    and unfocused.</p><p>
    
    David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" is one of many highlights here, as again the kids
    have the downtrodden verse melody mastered, and even coordinate the countdown
    with some pounding percussion.  Plus, someone in there is dropping some serious
    spook-organ, and another kid is going crazy on the special effects guitar.  It's
    an amazing track, followed by another, ""The Long and Winding Road.""  Now, I don't
    really even like this song-- it may be one of the worst songs the Beatles ever
    recorded.  However, the Langley Schools arrangement for solo vocal (one of a few
    on the CD) and humble piano accompaniment brings out what was apparently actual
    inherent sincerity in the tune.</p><p>
    
    The record isn't an all low-key affair; later, the kids bring out the noise in
    the Bay City Rollers' ""Saturday Night"" with stomping and cheerleader chanting
    that only fifth graders can make legitimate (which begs the question of how grown
    men ever performed this song).  They pull out the same stops on Herman Hermits'
    ""I'm Into Something Good"" to similar effect (and begging the same question).</p><p>
    
    My favorites, though, are their versions of ""Desperado"" and the Carpenters'
    ""Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft.""  The former is another incredible
    solo vocal version of a tune that I always thought was extremely cornball.  I
    would go so far as to say that this version of the song, with a young singer
    performing with so much heartfelt, delicate emotion I seriously almost cried,
    is definitive.  The latter begins as yet another solo vocal, though the full
    choir joins in quite soon, along with bells and swelling cymbals and bells.
    You'd think they were really announcing the next wave of civilization, saying
    goodbye to the modern world in favor of something less image-conscious and much
    more honest and plain fun.  They even changed tempos in the middle.</p><p>
    
    Now, in all honesty, a whole record of kids, albeit inspired, singing your 70s
    AM Gold hits has a greater-than-zero potential of getting a little stale after a
    while.  There's a wonderful feeling listening to this record that all will be
    well with our world, and that as long as the children are happy and singing, we
    have nothing to worry about.  But after a while, if I need to put on some AC/DC
    or something, I hope they don't take it personally.</p></div>"|4685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4685-innocence-and-despair/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    his confusing tendency to record under countless radar-eluding aliases.  For his
    two full-length 2001 excursions, Kruger selected his Dub Taylor mask and
    attempted to grab some of the glory surrounding minimal maestro, Matthias
    Schaffhauser.  <i>Detect</i>, Kruger-as-Taylor's second full-length in 2001, is
    more of a compilation than <i>Forms and Figures</i>, the other 2001 album Kruger
    released for Raum-Musik.</p><p>
    
    Because of the speed at which Kruger creates his tracks, <i>Detect</i> doesn't
    sound like a fits-and-starts hodgepodge of an assembly.  But it doesn't sound
    like a winner, either.  When compared to other similarly inflected artists, the
    music Taylor rolls out is commonplace and merely functional-- the title track,
    for example, is merely a serviceable and crunchy rendition of the glitch-dub
    house that's characterized the Chain Reaction label for the last five years.
    Yes, Kruger's concession to innovation is restricted to a punchy bassline and
    slightly click-hop-derived percussion.</p><p>
    
    ""Sweet Lips"" is the first vocal cut on <i>Detect</i>, and like the album's other
    four sing-songs, it suffers from a want of melody.  Vocal house cuts, by my
    reckoning, should be hummable euphoria.  And ""Sweet Lips,"" while vaguely
    memorable, is hampered by a clumsy lyric about wanting ""your sweet lips on mine.""
    In a club setting, and after five pints of lager, such things might not bother
    me.  But at home, I get to choose the music and it wouldn't hurt this song's
    rotation to be a little more interesting.  ""Observer"" is a tougher version of
    the opener and sounds as though a tribally elated Danny Tenaglia or sleazy
    funked Richard Morel had embraced the white-noise dub of Berlin.</p><p>
    
    ""Newman"" sinks the listener deep beneath an ocean of echoes where Lee Perry
    trades rhythmic jabs with Moritz von Oswald's Rhythm and Sound project. With
    vocals by Per Fourier, ""Something Somewhere"" and ""Our Youth"" launch you back to
    bassbin-serrating tech-house. ""John Wayne"" is not an homage to the Duke that I
    had expected, unless Wayne was really a k-hole queen who loved to squirm his
    butt-cheek-exposing leather-chaps into the nether regions of dancers around him.</p><p>
    
    ""I Can't (""...You Know)"" is the closest Kruger has had to a recognizable club tune.
    He combines his woofer-worrying basslines with delicate Fender Rhodes noodling.
    Fourier unmemorably joins in with a lyric about not being able to fall in love
    with anyone but some dark-eyed temptress who's made off with his heart. I'd love
    to hear a vocal-less version, as Kruger uncuts Fourier's blankly delivered vocals
    with what sounds like a battling Eric Dolphy bass clarinet.  Then, <i>Detect</i>
    concludes with ""2scale,"" in which Kruger returns to his roots with the kind of
    echoing dub space that's influenced so much of European techno for years.  As
    such, the record adds little new to the style, but hardly disgraces it either.</p></div>"|7951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7951-detect/|6.6|Paul Cooper

There's really no bin to
    file him in, though he's had his paws in just about everything that's happened
    in popular music since his career began way back in the 1950s.  In certain
    respects, he fits rather nicely next to other idiosyncratic figures of his
    heyday-- guys like Van Dyke Parks and Lee Hazlewood who kept up appearances by
    writing pop songs and producing other peoples' albums, all the while compiling
    their own personal back catalogs of bizarre, often unclassifiable music.</p><p>
    
    However, his music sits in a different realm, more removed from traditional
    concepts of songwriting and instrumentation, and vastly more indebted to jazz.
    This makes sense, as Axelrod served as producer to such notables as Cannonball
    Adderley and Stan Kenton.  He's also responsible for much of Lou Rawls' mid-60s
    output, and the architect of the Electric Prunes' ultra-strange psychedelic
    <i>Mass in F# Minor</i>.  If you own anything by DJ Shadow, Kid Koala, or any
    number of other modern turntable collagists, chances are you've heard at least
    a few snippets of Axelrod's own solo work.  He even has a remixing credit himself
    on U.N.K.L.E.'s ""Rabbit in Your Headlights"" single.</p><p>
    
    His twelfth solo effort is a strange concoction of old and new that begs the
    listener to question when exactly it was recorded.  This is partly because it
    was actually recorded in two completely different eras.  The majority of the
    basic rhythm tracks for seven of the nine songs included here were recorded
    thirty years ago for an aborted project for Warner Brothers.  Axelrod had
    actually completed the charts decades ago, but it wasn't until Mo'Wax became
    interested in the project at the close of the last century that any initiative
    was undertaken to finish the recordings.</p><p>
    
    The thirty-year-old acetates blend surprisingly well with the new sessions-- so
    well, in fact, that it's basically impossible to tell what's new and what's old.
    The things we know are new are the first and last tracks-- the album's only vocal
    songs.  David Axelrod opens with cold, quivering strings strangely juxtaposed
    with James Hughart's fretless bass leads.  What this gives way to, however, is
    much stranger.</p><p>
    
    Saxophones and bassoon creep into the mix, providing a strange, menacing undertow
    that sounds nearly medieval in character.  Deepening the mood is a choir that
    sounds more like a group of untrained people singing in a church than a tight
    professional ensemble.  The choir exits for the entrance of West Coast rapper
    Ras Kass, who plows through some impressive verses of beatless orchestral hip-hop
    before Lanny Morgan's jazzy alto sax solo seizes the spotlight.  Kass returns
    stronger than ever in Morgan's wake, though, spouting lines like, ""And your
    judges will all have work/ And your lawyers will flap their tongues/ And all
    your jail guards and cops/ Will be the fathers to your young.""  He laughingly
    tosses off the final line, ""Auction off your future.""</p><p>
    
    This startling beginning is a pretty good indicator of what the rest of the
    record sounds like over the course of its too-brief 35 minute span.  ""Jimmy
    T"" begins with Howard Roberts' freakish guitar lead before slipping into some
    sort of quasi-soul groove provided by L.A. studio legends Carol Kaye (bass),
    Lou Morell (guitar) and Earl Palmer (drums).  Bob Efford offers an impressive
    baritone sax solo, and if you were curious, Joe Sample's the guy at the organ.
    Dissonant strings cut like shards through the bottom of the mix, and the overall
    result is unlike anything I've ever heard.</p><p>
    
    ""Crystal Ball"" follows with a somewhat more identifiable Phil Spector vibe, but
    that doesn't fully explain what it sounds like.  Strings flutter in the wings,
    horns blare in from every direction, the guitars sound like they wandered away
    from a James Brown album, and the bass almost sounds lifted from <i>Pet
    Sounds</i>.</p><p>
    
    This leaves us with the singularly pretty ""Fantasy for Ralph.""  Ernie Watt's
    soprano sax solo is so unaffected and unpretentious that it ends up conveying
    a beauty very much unlike what we conventionally think of as ""pretty"" in modern
    music.  The flutes and other window dressing that introduce the track somehow
    manage to transcend the schmaltzy connotation that such an arrangement would
    usually have, and the overall effect is far more current sounding than it
    probably should be.</p><p>
    
    ""The Dr. and the Diamond"" and ""Big B Plus"" continue down this same richly
    textured and wildly eccentric path, with the latter sounding something like a
    cross between a parade, a string quartet and a hive of bees.  Flutes flutter
    constantly on the edges of the song, giving the proceedings a frenzied, nervous
    feel as the drums and horns clamor away underneath, only to have the whole
    affair interrupted by melting cellos and violins.  ""For Land's Sake"" travels
    to a Southern revival for a bit of gospel, albeit gospel polluted by any number
    of other bastard elements that are awfully difficult to pin down.   Then comes
    the moody ""The Shadow Knows,"" an oddly hip-hopish track (remember, those drums
    were recorded thirty years ago) laced with traces of Peter Thomas' ""Space Patrol""
    scores and endowed with more of Howard Roberts' utterly bizarre guitar leads.</p><p>
    
    David Axelrod closes on a powerful note with ""Loved Boy,"" dedicated to his
    deceased son Terry.  Lou Rawls infuses the simple lyrics with an intense passion
    that almost makes it sound as though it's his own son that was lost.  Oscar
    Brashear's clarion trumpet lines do their best to hold Rawls together with their
    conversational tones, but he owns the song, seemingly dragging the arrangement
    along with him as though it were the very burden of grief.  The orchestra sounds
    broken, chugging along with a sense of duty to the recording, but never slipping
    into gear.  The result is so devastatingly sad and desolate that it's difficult
    to imagine a weirder or more appropriate homage to a departed loved one.</p><p>
    
    David Axelrod has created an utterly unique recording with his twelfth album--
    one that sounds neither dated, nor of its time.  Rather, it exists in that world
    of albums that really have no time-- albums like Scott Walker's <i>Tilt</i> or
    Joni Mitchell's <i>Mingus</i>.  It even comes with unique packaging, strangely
    wrapped in a cardboard slip case and inner artwork that resembles a little
    starship.  It's hard to say who exactly would like this album, but it's nearly
    impossible for me not to recommend it.  If you have a taste for something new
    and a desire to hear an album whose effect will likely never be approximated
    anywhere else, I urge you to give this one a spin.</p></div>"|391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/391-david-axelrod/|7.9|Joe Tangari

Sappy longing for what once was, and pathetic cries in the
    face of temporality to reverse its unending drive forward all end up a complete
    waste.  Wasn't it the great Oprah Winfrey that assisted millions of bourgeois
    housewives all over America to stop living in the past?  Perhaps we should
    transfer such pop-psychology to our own indie living.</p><p>
    
    But I just can't get past the fact that this Cherubino record's gotten me all
    nostalgic. The Self-Starter foundation prides itself in releasing the debut
    albums by Karate and Les Savy Fav, and now bringing us the debut seven-song EP
    from NYC-based emo trio Cherubino. That's right, the emo never dies.  Just like
    the past, I would say.</p><p>
    
    You see, Cherubino's raw rock elements and lighthearted melodies have me all
    distraught over the death of Pavement and that zany Malkmus, the times when
    Weezer weren't so damn terrible, and the fact that the electrified wails of
    the White Stripes aren't in my stereo at the moment. Of course, I could always
    change the disc and relive those <i>Pinkerton</i> years in a second, but it's
    just not the same.</p><p>
    
    And it's not that Cherubino sounds anything like any of the aforementioned bands--
    only that certain elements spark that sort of nostalgia in me. The quasi-lo-fi
    rock isn't totally lo-fi a la early Pavement, though the vague, Malkmus-inflected
    lyrics do aspire to that level of brilliance (without quite making it). The
    guitar solo of ""Mercury Retrograde"" screams <i>Blue Album</i> Weezer with its
    simplistic melodic sensibility soaked in overdrive. Lines like, ""We could build a
    house just for two,"" from the same track, and the vocal turns in ""Rocket,"" are
    delivered with an almost passionate disregard by frontman Travis Peterson that
    sounds like a subdued Jack White.  Drummer Karen Tercho even chimes in for a
    vocal cameo on the latter in addition to her bangin' beats.</p><p>
    
    But one must understand the divergence between these modern legends and Cherubino.
    For one, the lyrics are concerned with little other than failing relationships.
    ""It's gonna take more than a kiss to make up for this,"" sings Peterson over the
    heavy shuffle of the opening track, ""Kiss."" The lyric is intoned with a
    playfulness that transcends the line's superficial banality, primarily because
    of its implications.   And just like it takes some talent to even draw comparison
    to those greats, Cherubino rises above the general fodder of their contemporaries
    to create something that hints at potential.</p><p>
    
    Hints of synth peek through the mix on a few tracks, and like the brilliant
    breaking of the film strip incorporated into Ingmar Bergman's <i>Persona</i>,
    the sound disintegrates in the middle of ""Car Wreck."" Their live performances
    are known for their inebriated energy, but like former Foundationeers Les Savy
    Fav, the sheer romp of this energy is lost in the studio. What bothers me most
    is that even <i>Bird</i>'s twenty-five minutes feel a bit indulgent. Unlike Les
    Savy Fav, Cherubino has yet to stretch their genre's stodgy boundaries. Of
    course, this is only their first release, so we can hope for the best in their
    future, but for now I'm going to go curl up in the corner with my <i>Wowee Zowee</i>.</p></div>"|1425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1425-bird/|5.0|Christopher F. Schiel

    '00s just might be the era of the Brooders. The Brooders, led by an exciting cast
    of unmanly, oversensitive, introspective introverts, make music that is often
    euphemized as sad-rock or slow-core. Even the euphemisms are negative. This should
    tell you something.</p><p>
    
    It just so happens that Badman Recording Company has devoted its label to giving
    the suicidal among us a public forum. Job requirements at Badman are minimal-- a
    guitar, a voice, and a Prozac prescription.  Talent scouting involves rubber
    gloves, a good eye, and a psychiatrist's dumpster. All the hard work has come
    with mixed success, scoring Badman some winners (e.g. Hayden), some most-of-the-time
    winners (e.g. Mark Kozelek), and now, a guy who could use a little boost.
    Counseling, maybe?</p><p>
    
    The man of whom I speak is named Brian Dunn. Dunn fronts a five-piece ensemble
    known as the Clairvoyants who presumably gain strength from being by themselves,
    yet spend much of that time lamenting their own solitude. Dunn's songs are slow
    and monotonous, dominated by several elements, the most notable of which is
    nothing in particular; it makes you wonder what the other four people were doing.
    And as for the monotony, I'm curious as to which mnemonic Dunn uses to keep the
    songs separate in his head.</p><p>
    
    Besides for the plethora of nothing, Dunn's voice occupies a decent amount of the
    foreground. It's a familiar one, a gaunt, meatless blend of Nick Drake, Chris
    Isaak and Brave Sir Robin's lead Minstrel. Now imagine compiling the orchestration
    of the first two and subtracting three out of every four notes, and you have,
    roughly, the Clairvoyants. Aroused?  Maybe if you're a sloth.</p><p>
    
    A big part of it lacking emotional power is the oh-so-bad lyrics. Oh, they are so
    bad. In ""Surface of the Water,"" for example, Dunn whines that, ""You need me to
    keep you/ From harming yourself/ I know it's futile/ I know it's futile.""  He
    enunciates ""futile"" with the anal precision of James Lipton. It comes out as the
    perfectly pronounced compound of its components-- ""few"" and ""tile""-- with loads
    of emphasis on the ""tile"" part.</p><p>
    
    Under a microscope, the Clairvoyants might make you wretch. However, if you do as
    I did and take a few steps back (concentrate on the Super Bowl, cook some dinner,
    IM your ex-girlfriend), <i>Your New Boundaries</i> makes for decent background
    music. The tones of Dunn's voice combined with his tasteful backing band are
    mellow, somber, and well-produced. But you can answer this question as well as
    I: is your record collection lacking ""decent background music?"" Is this a gap you
    need to fill?  Do you really need stuff that absolutely refuses to grab your
    attention?  Wouldn't your money be better spent on one of Badman's <i>good</i>
    releases?  The answers are likely no, no, no, and yes. A wise move would be to
    set <i>your</i> new boundaries just short of the Clairvoyants.</p></div>"|1483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1483-your-new-boundaries/|4.8|Brad Haywood

Thanks to Ryan's system of review placement (the
    lower the rating, the lower down you go), I always seem to occupy the nether
    regions of the review column.  Which begs the question: am I getting all the
    shitty releases, or am I just that hard to please?</p><p>
    
    It used to be different.  It was more of an arbitrary editorial decision, and
    I lobbied for a return to that system earlier today.  ""Jefe,"" I said, ""you
    should really push this Melochrome review up into the featured spot. Give me--
    uh, I mean <i>them</i>-- some exposure, some hype.""</p><p>
    
    ""Yeah?  What'd you rate it?""</p><p>
    
    ""Uh... so.  How about those Bears?""</p><p>
    
    Where to begin?  Oh hell, let's just dive in.  The songs don't take shape; rather,
    they lose shape, unraveling along the way.  They go from a sketch to a blank
    page; from a metal frame to a pile of wind-blown rust.  The persistent problem
    is long length with no real development or point.  The songs try to build up
    in delicate layers, with all the chance of a souffle at O'Hare.  Even Melochrome's
    sole, half-hearted attempt at rocking-out, ""Summer Jens,"" feels miserably out of
    place.</p><p>
    
    The successful exception is the instrumental centerpiece, the seven-minute
    ""Aqueduct"" which mixes some mildly interesting two-fingered guitar work with
    found-sound and a song-long shimmer.  This type of gentle, meandering
    instrumental immediately recalls the Six Parts Seven's work (and not only
    because of the e-bow).  Also, the closer, ""Boyfriend,"" has some piano and
    violin interplay to make up for its undeveloped melody and dirge-like
    progression.  But that about sums up the good.</p><p>
    
    A compact example of one of <i>Stay a Little Longer</i>'s more grand flaws can
    be found on the third track.  ""The Years Go By"" begins innocently enough, a
    pleasing mix of strummed changes and keyboard diddling going hand-in-hand through
    commonplace chord progressions.  With the first couple tracks, singer Prammod
    Tummala had already established that his soft nasal singing is strained at best
    and seizure-inducing at worst, so that's not really a surprise here.  But then
    the boy/girl vocal-trading comes in.</p><p>
    
    Personally, I found bassist Darlene Poole to possess one of the most distasteful
    voices I've ever heard.  She sounds like Joey Lauren Adams on Sudafed.  Now,
    plenty of folks love Ms. Adams and think her voice is just fine-- even sexy.
    That's great.  They would probably dig Darlene, too.  However, I don't associate
    with that kind of folk, because I'm just that kind of guy.</p><p>
    
    So, that's what really did in half of the album for me.  Just as Kevin Costner
    can ruin what would be an otherwise perfectly fine Hollywood movie merely by
    being cast in it, Poole's singing is the death knell for <i>Stay a Little
    Longer</i>.  A horrible, off-key, piercing knell.  I can't help but think that
    if there had been exciting, challenging music to counterbalance this effect,
    the whole affair wouldn't have gone down like a whore named Titanic.</p></div>"|5214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5214-stay-a-little-longer/|4.1|John Dark

    The original cover art for <i>Party Music</i>, planned long before the events of
    September 11th, and originally intended to go to press on that fateful day,
    featured an image of the Twin Towers exploding, with the two rappers posturing
    in front of them-- one holding conductor's batons, the other holding a detonator.
    The image, says the duo, was intended as a metaphor for the effect music can have
    on a corrupt system. 75 Ark said no. A last minute phone-call stopped the presses
    and the cover was redesigned. Still, no doubt, the Coup will go down in history
    as a strange footnote to a tragic day, the unfortunate timing of the album cover
    remembered long after the music.  And that's too bad, because Boots Riley and
    Pam the Funkstress deserve to be remembered for their music. You see, the Coup
    knows the secret to effective politicization: before you can change people's
    minds, you have to engage them.</p><p>
    
    Like Public Enemy and George Orwell before them, the Coup focuses on the art,
    not the politics, trusting that if they do one right, the other will follow suit.
    The result is music that questions the common presumption that all things
    political must also be dry and boring. For one, the Coup's is a sound drenched
    in R&amp;B; and soul tradition, holding more in common with Outkast's raucous
    funk-driven beats than it does with similarly minded rap groups like Cannibal Ox.
    As such, the Coup are likely to reach an audience less accustomed to these types
    of ideas.</p><p>
    
    Wrapping their political missives in twisted, slithering rhymes like, ""This is my
    resume/ Slash-resignation/ A ransom note/ With proposed legislation,"" Riley and
    Pam prove that the music is every bit as important as the politics.  In ""50
    Million Ways to Kill a CEO,"" the Coup demonstrates a wickedly dark comic
    sensibility, taking the cartoonish tendency towards violence often prevalent in
    popular rap music and applying it to an uncharacteristic victim. Among their
    suggestions: ""Toss a dollar in the river/ And when he jump in/ If you find he
    can swim/ Put lead boots on him and do it again/ You and a friend/ Videotape
    and the party don't end/ Tell him that boogers be sellin' like crack/ He gon'
    put the little baggies in his nose/ And suffocate like that/ Put a fifty in the
    barrel of a gun/ When he try to suck it out/ A-ha!/ Well, you know this one...""</p><p>
    
    For the less murder-inclined, Riley and Pam offer a few slightly less radical
    solutions to societal problems; simple things like rebelling against unjust
    authority or merely choosing a stance (""Take a look around/ And be for or
    against/ But you can't do shit if you ridin' the fence"").  But things really hit
    their stride on ""Get Up,"" where guest MCs stic.man and M-1 from Dead Prez intone,
    ""It's a war goin' on, the ghetto is a cage/ They only give you two choices; be a
    rebel or a slave,"" while a group of female vocalists sing an atypical mantra in
    typical R&amp;B; backup singer style: ""You're 'sposed to be fed up right now/ Turn the
    system upside down.""</p><p>
    
    The Coup cater masterfully to a wide audience, always holding fast to their values.
    Only once do they stray too far in their attempt for a broad listenership.  ""Heven
    Tonite"" is the requisite sensitive rap song, and while the lyrics are stronger
    than most in this maligned subgenre, any sentiment is negated by the Swiss-cheese
    guitars lifted right off a smooth jazz station. <i>Party Music</i> doesn't quite
    pick itself up in the two songs that follow, but by this point, it doesn't much
    matter. They've already proven themselves worthy, and a few weak songs do not a
    weak album make.</p><p>
    
    There's been a tendency since the World Trade Center attacks to keep talk of
    political dissent to a minimum. In the meantime, our leaders have continued to
    act in their own best interests, using the current wave of patriotism as
    permission to hold open the federal wallet to corporations, cut funding to
    important programs, and refuse to sign the International Nuclear Arms Treaty.
    Meanwhile, the press reports little-to-none of this, fearing the possible
    consequences.  In times like these, groups like the Coup become that much more
    important. <i>Party Music</i> is an effort both entertaining and politically
    motivating, a feat which many have attempted but few have successfully pulled
    off. Perhaps its radical message will succeed where other dissidents have failed:
    in galvanizing those who've become disenchanted with our fearless leadership of
    late, and in introducing a few others to the healthy practice of skepticism.</p></div>"|1633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1633-party-music/|7.9|David M. Pecoraro

    be a history of German humor. He said this, I believe, without having read a
    single interview with Markus Popp. The dour German stereotype may be common for
    people in the States raised on ""Sprockets,"" but it's just not accurate. Exhibit
    A: Flanger.</p><p>
    
    Look at the front of this record cover: Atom Heart and Burnt Friedman standing
    on the barren surface of some distant planet in full astronaut gear. Only it's
    not really them, just some cropped press photos of their faces pasted into jpegs
    pulled from the NASA site. They look so damn goofy standing there on that
    planet, but they're clearly in on the fun. And then there are long-winded the
    liner notes, written by a fellow named James Dean Brown, which claim, ""The only
    way of downscaling Burnt's musical-conviction potentiometer is to previously
    install a logical bypass.""</p><p>
    
    On second thought, Mr. Dean Brown could be on to something. A potentiometer is
    an instrument for analyzing electrical potential, and <i>Outer Space/Inner Space</i>
    is vastly superior to last year's <i>Midnight Sound</i> because it contains so
    much more possibility.  Both records are basically light cocktail jazz
    manipulated via computer, but where the source of <i>Midnight Sound</i>'s crackly,
    raw material seemed nebulous, <i>Outer Space/Inner Space</i> is a crisp recording
    of live musicians who put some energy in their playing. Hearing this more
    ""natural"" approach bumping against the electronics gives the record a great deal
    more tension than the sleepy <i>Midnight Sound</i> could muster. It also makes
    the listening more fun.</p><p>
    
    The third track, ""The Men Who Fell from Earth,"" is a nice illustration of what
    I'm talking about. The opening section blends percussive static hits with
    manipulated drum runs of inhuman tempo, and then the piece abruptly transforms
    into lazy downtempo lounge for a couple of minutes before accelerating once
    again into spastic glitch music. Each individual part is rendered properly, but
    you'd never imagined that they could fit together so well, or indeed, that they
    could fit together at all. ""Lo Dernier Combat"" is another track that seamlessly
    modulates from Medeski, Martin and Wood-style instrumental jazz to abstract
    electronics and back again. The skill here is in the transitions-- not only are
    they not jarring, but each stylistic shift seems perfectly logical. Odd guitar
    treatments crop up here and there, courtesy of enigmatic Cologne musician Josef
    Suchy, lending another intriguing texture.</p><p>
    
    The tracks that fall outside the conceptual framework still impress with their
    melodic sense and rhythmic interplay. Though the album was no doubt edited on
    computer and it's quite possible that none of the musicians actually performed
    together (the notes list separate recording studios for each of the
    instruments), the infectiousness of the Latin beats is undeniable, and the three
    Chilean percussionists credited help give the record an impressive syncopated
    pulse. ""Inner Spacesuit,"" in particular, absolutely bubbles with rhythm, and it
    always makes me wish I had a drink of some kind in my hand when I hear it. But
    this straight-up track has a surprising coda, as the rhythm fades and Suchy's
    processed guitar harmonics take over, sending the piece spinning off in a
    completely different but equally attractive direction. Both funny ha-ha and
    funny strange, <i>Outer Space/Inner Space</i> is worth exploring.</p></div>"|11740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11740-outer-spaceinner-space/|8.1|Mark Richard-San

Yet, when I'm thrown into an environment
    surrounded by people, most of whom don't know me, I tend to find a quiet corner.
    Sure, a party is supposed to be a <i>social</i> gathering, but for whatever
    reason, I just can't help being lulled into a space where only I exist.</p><p>
    Thankfully, Chad Crouch and the crew over at Portland, Oregon's Hush Records
    have made available a series of records under the ""Anti-Rock"" banner. Lacking
    ambition or exuberance, Hush records are perhaps the most conducive records
    available for those inappropriately introspective moments. And Bobby Birdman's
    debut is no exception.</p><p>
    Bobby Birdman is Rob Kieswetter's stage name, and even sounds like a 1960's
    throwback sort of pseudonym, which happens to perfectly reflect Birdman's music.
    Singing of love, ominousness, and being cold, <i>Let Me In</i> reminds one of
    the Microphones' Phil Elvrum was he to lose his analog fixation and begin toying
    with a Powerbook. But in traditional Hush form, these electronics are about as
    subtle as Björk's swan dress, remaining calm and atmospheric. Accompanied by
    simple drum machine loops, a lulling, strummed acoustic guitar, and these
    inorganic treatments, Birdman's voice resembles a tired Stephen Merritt trading
    in the throaty tenor for a smoothly delivered, wispy croon.</p><p>
    ""I Must Admit That I Love You"" opens the record gently with a manipulated cymbal
    fade-in, which is overtaken by a primitive drum machine line resembling one of
    those credit card metronomes that were used in my middle school orchestra class.
    Not that this comes across as silly, but the aura of <i>Let Me In</i> resounds of
    little ambition and even less groundbreaking. A bassy drone complements Birdman's
    voice as he moans the album's eponymous line. The melody is sweet and nostalgic,
    and remains as such throughout the rest of the record.</p><p>
    ""Moving On/Up"" and its instrumental counterpart, ""Paradise Dub,"" are based upon
    decelerated drum loops.  An acoustic guitar lazily strums a single chord in time
    with the percussion, with leads the way for Elvrum-esque vocal ""ahh's"" in harmony.
    ""Moving"" melds into ""Paradise,"" which plays the loop offset with a very subtle
    reference to the chord progression of the previous track.</p><p>
    ""Golden Arms"" follows, an almost a cappella number backed by light backwards
    guitar lines. The lyrics, once again, draw a line to Elvrum: ""I walked up the
    hill/ Into the dark/ Out of my body/ I moved undetected."" ""J Tear"" begins with a
    gratuitous three minutes of Birdman repeatedly counting out waltz-time with some
    echo manipulations, before fading into another mellow acoustic guitar number.
    ""Hey Now"" is a gorgeously simple song enshrouded in vocal harmonies, calming
    down to ""Such an Icy Feeling,"" another quasi-a cappella track in which the
    voice clicks from slight electronic manipulation, while quiet drones hum in
    the background.</p><p>
    The record reaches a poppy apex with ""Blue Skies,"" complete with acoustic drums,
    other people's voices, and a sing-along chorus: ""There'll be blue skies/ Nothing
    but blue skies."" Yet it never broaches the in-your-face border and collapses
    into a looped-vocal coda, after which Birdman breathes his last moan with the
    closer, ""Perfect for Light."" On the whole, <i>Let Me In</i> may bore some with
    its lack of motivation and the seeming absence of passion, but to me, it seems
    like <i>Let Me In</i> was created for my wrong-place, wrong-time introspection.</p></div>"|716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/716-let-me-in/|7.5|Christopher F. Schiel

    Well, yes and no. It all depends on artist or album. It seems like one of the
    hardest things for musicians to accomplish is to write songs that are both
    genuinely funny and musically valid-- something more than just novelties. Zappa
    did it on a few occasions (but then again, if you release dozens upon dozens of
    albums, you're bound to have a few successes), and then there's Ween and the
    Dead Milkmen, both of which frequently pulled off the balancing act.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, there are bands like Barenaked Ladies who try to impress with
    a constant stream of pop culture references and end up with unforgivably annoying
    frat-boy sing-a-longs, and Ben Folds who half-assed his way through both his
    ""serious"" and ""funny"" songs, undercutting them both.</p><p>
    
    Of all the recent attempts to tread this fine line between quality and humor,
    Parker Paul does it better than almost anyone.  A former member of the
    Charlottesville, Virginia-based band the Curious Digit (which also featured Adam
    Busch, currently of Manishevitz), <i>Wingfoot</i> is Paul's second solo disc.
    Piano and other assorted keyboards remain the musical fulcrum here, as they
    were on his debut, <i>Lemon-Lime Room</i>, but Paul has rounded out his sound on
    <i>Wingfoot</i> with help from a host of luminaries from the Chicago music scene
    like Jeb Bishop (Vandermark 5), Fred Lonberg-Holm, Wil Hendricks, the aforementioned
    Adam Busch, and Songs: Ohia guitarist Dan Sullivan.  And as a bonus, the whole
    deal was committed to tape by Michael Krassner of the Lofty Pillars and Boxhead
    Ensemble.</p><p>
    
    On the surface, Parker Paul strongly recalls Ben Folds, if only because all his
    songs are piano-based, but a better comparison might be Randy Newman-- or, to go
    outside the realm of music, Woody Allen. His songs, like Allen's best films, use
    humor to explore themes of existential dread and anxiety. But whereas Allen's
    tone is neurotic and self-deprecating, Paul's is bemused and detached.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Wingfoot</i>, nowhere is this better exemplified than with ""When I Got You
    at the Pound.""  Preaching salvation by means of a pet dog (and remember, dog
    spelled backwards is God), Paul sings to this canine messiah after seeing a
    show on pet therapy for the elderly: ""Last night I dreamt of heaven/ All of our
    names on your collar."" The song also features the best lyrics about sifting
    through dog vomit that I know of: ""Night crawlers and blades of grass/ Shifting
    continents in egg yolk/ Lincoln's profile in the morass.""</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Paul tackles the human condition with ""Pain, Pain, Pain, Pain, Pain""
    (take a guess what it's about) where he reveals, ""Catholics propose pain is the
    path we all should have chose/ But the Unitarians are much more interested in
    fun."" Yet what saves this song is from being a simple joke is the same thing
    that saves Paul from being a simple novelty: the little lyrical profundities he
    tosses in the middle of everything, like on ""Pain,"" which ends with the lines,
    ""Hold something in your hand/ Set it down, say a prayer, walk away."" Written
    here, it doesn't seem like much, but in the context of the song, it makes all
    the sense in the world, clicking like a Zen koan in the mind.  If you're
    paying attention, most of the songs on <i>Wingfoot</i> have these little lyrical
    nuggets, but if you're not careful, they'll float right by like Marshall McLuhan's
    cameo in <i>Annie Hall</i>.</p></div>"|6194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6194-wingfoot/|7.1|Jason Nickey

It seemed decades since

    bore a sense of pride that had been all but foreign to me since high school.
    After the necessary paperwork had been filled out, I was presented with a number
    of options for possible courses.  Only two piqued my interest: one cryptically
    titled ""Cultural Literacy and Criticism""; the other called ""Nathaniel Merriweather's
    Deconstruction of the Modern Eros.""  I had no idea what ""Cultural Literacy"" could
    possibly mean and, having gone to public school, I decided it was probably
    instituted for aspiring writers.  So, under the impression that I'd have more
    opportunities to utilize my talents as a writer than as a lovemaker, I opted for
    ""Cultural Literacy and Criticism.""</p><p>
    
    Initially, I was plagued with regret.  It had come to my attention that Mr.
    Merriweather was to have a very strange assortment of characters guest lecture
    before his class, and the resident prelector of cultural literacy, one Dr. Nayr
    Rebierhcs, was hardly concerned with churning out the next Shakespeare. For the
    first few days of the course, I was completely in the dark as to what he hoped
    to achieve by talking about the ""science of wit,"" ""litmus tests for cultural
    relevancy,"" and ""the tragic dictatorship of media-induced opinion."" But eventually,
    things began to fall into perspective.  On one particularly enlightening occasion,
    Dr. Rebierhcs was instructing the class on effective literary devices:</p><p>
    
    ""We shall begin,"" he said in his usual didactic bravado, ""with the most primitive
    device a critic must keep in his canon: the analogy.  We'll start with a very
    simple example and then move onto more esoteric selections.  Darren Aronofsky's
    <i>Pi</i> is to independent cinema as Will Cullen Hart's Circulatory System is
    to independent music."" The class reacted to this with varying degrees of
    inquisition, but eventually came to the consensus that the statement was
    plausible. The doctor's eyes scoured the room, finally settling on mine.</p><p>
    
    ""Mr. Adickes, can you give us an example of analogy?""</p><p>
    
    I struggled for a few moments and then thought of Mr. Merriweather and his motley
    crew of ""sexperts.""  I stammered out, ""Mike Patton is to sex as Abe Vigoda is...
    to sex.""</p><p>
<i>Lovage</i> meets every expectation one would have for an ""all-star"" line-up,
    had their preconceptions of an ""all-star"" group been defined in the 80s with the
    release of Band-Aid's ""Do They Know Its Christmas?""  Or was ""Heal the World""
    the prototype Dan the Automator followed when assembling the likes of Prince
    Paul, Kid Koala, Plug 3 of De La Soul, Jennifer Charles of Elysian Fields,
    and Mike Patton to create a self-parodying album about doing the dirty?
    Regardless of where the formula originated, someone needs to crack a window
    'cause it's gone bad.</p><p>
    
    The album begins, modestly enough, with an endorsement from Prince Paul, the
    Automator's partner-in-mediocrity from Handsome Boy Modeling School.  This sets
    the tone (and, incidentally, the tempo) for the remainder of the record. As
    flourishes of mandolins and a sampled brass section segue into ""Pit Stop (Take
    Me Home),"" the album's thematic developments come to a jarring halt thanks solely
    to the absolutely wretched lyrical content.  All but one song was written by Dan
    the Automator (aka Nathaniel Merriweather), Jennifer Charles, and Mike Patton,
    and each sounds like something a cocktail waitress would find scrawled on a
    napkin freshly slipped to her by a roaming businessman. ""I think a pussy's your
    best bet/ Stroke that shiny coat/ Stroking is the antidote/ Stroke that/ It's a
    start/ Only for the wild heart."" I've listened to this album ten times straight
    and the genius of these lyrics, which find Jennifer Charles graphically
    chronicling a <i>menage a trois</i>, has managed to elude me.</p><p>
    
    The music is infinitely more tolerable, though it occasionally becomes as garish
    as the album's art, which is horrible even by the lenient standards of kitsch.
    Here are some basic musical ingredients which, if all mixed together, would give
    you a fair idea of the Automator's musical approximation of ""love-making"":</p><p>
<li> Nino Rota: <i>The Godfather</i> sdtk.<br/>
<li> James Brown: ""It's a Man's World""<br/>
<li> Rene Lalou: <i>La Planete Sauvage</i> (psychedelic interludes only)<br/>
<li> Enya: <i>Shepherd's Moon</i><br/>
<li> Massive Attack (if wounded): <i>Blue Lines</i><br/>
<li> Samples about venereal disease<p>
    
    Now that doesn't bode very well, does it?  The negativity doesn't end there, I'm
    afraid.  My biggest gripe about <i>Lovage</i> is that it finds a number of
    clearly talented artists constructing the same song continually without variation.
    Kid Koala, for one, lays down some nice turntable work, but is never allowed to
    exercise his full potential.  If the mood strikes you, songs like ""Sex (I'm A)""
    and ""Strangers on a Train"" can be mildly affecting.  But the sensuousness of many
    of these tracks relies solely on Charles' heavy breathing and husky voice, and
    somewhere around the ironically titled ""Love that Lovage, Baby,"" the potency of
    her moans begins to wear off.  Which is why none of this makes any sense: if
    there's anything Nathaniel Merriweather hates, it's impotence.</p></li></li></li></li></li></li></p></div>"|4876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4876-music-to-make-love-to-your-old-lady-by/|4.5|Kevin Adickes

    has been unparalleled.  His newest LP, the debut from his blues trio the
    Black-Eyed Snakes, displays his brooding versatility.  Here, he exchanges the
    romantic, wistful, and clearly Caucasian tones of the slowcore indie-brood for
    the coarse, soulful brood of the blues.</p><p>
    
    Although not nearly a blues pioneer, Sparhawk, along with drummer Brad Nelson
    and guitarist Bobby Olson, displays a studied faithfulness to the genre. For the
    most part, the sound is vintage electric Chicago blues, employing a raw
    two-guitar attack that buzzes with the dirty sound of overworked amps and blown
    speakers. To give the reptiles some balls, Sparhawk's ordinarily sweet,
    reflective vocals are made crude by innumerable filters and feedback.</p><p>
    
    The Snakes' songs range from traditional to unconventional.  On the traditional
    side, the album opens with two foot-stomping guitar duels, ""Chicken Bone George,""
    which could pass for the work of another George (Thorogood), and ""Smokestack
    Lightnin',"" a cover of the classic Howlin' Wolf tune. Willie Dixon's legacy is
    preserved later in the album with a limp cover of his Chicago blues staple
    ""Mannish Boy,"" replete with screaming teenagers and poorly executed lyrical
    riffing.  And ""New Orleans"" is the band's finest blues original, built around a
    laggard guitar riff and wailing harmonica.</p><p>
    
    Less conventional are the neo-blues manipulation of Moby's Bessie Smith sample,
    ""Honey,"" a blues/post-punk hybrid cover of the Fall's ""My New House,"" and a
    Snakes original, ""Big Black Train."" The front-porch rhythm section and twangy
    guitar on ""Honey"" is likely to funk-up even the most ardent Moby haters. ""My New
    House"" is anomalously ambitious, playing with contemporary effects and production
    before dropping back into a traditional, overdriven blues jam. ""Big Black Train""
    uses song-structure familiar to Low (but with more sonic power): a four-chord
    progression, intensity built around simple, shifting dynamic elements like
    tempo and volume, and repetitive, single-stanza lyrics.</p><p>
    
    But conceptually, the Snakes could use a hand. Sparhawk pulls a Chris Gaines
    with the project, adopting a moderately retarded, self-created alter-ego named
    Chicken Bone George. My understanding has always been that bluesmen earn their
    nicknames, either by genetic defect or tragedy of misadventure. Whatever
    Sparhawk's reasons-- be it to help him remain in character, or simply as
    novelty-- it doesn't do much for the authenticity of the product. Everyone who
    will buy this album knows who George really is, and knows that he's been party
    to lyrics as sappy as, ""I held your last breath in my hand/ I held your last
    word in my heart."" Not exactly the pained expressions of a motherless,
    devil-pledged outlaw.</p><p>
    
    Sparhawk could especially do without some of the more contrived extensions of
    the persona. For example, his bluesman posturing is both ill-conceived and
    poorly executed, as on ""8-Inch Knife,"" where ""George"" delivers an unnerving
    exhortation for spouses to kill their philandering husbands (with oversized
    cookware). Sparhawk's goofy bluesman voice sounds like a bad Elvis impression,
    and the content is plainly silly. Unfortunately, Sparhawk's failure to ""sell""
    Chicken Bone George is persistently distracting. He would have been better to
    keep his own name and forget the act.</p><p>
    
    When an artist engages in music appreciation, as the Black-Eyed Snakes have with
    the blues, there's always the question of what makes the update worth buying. In
    this case, the answer isn't obvious; the majority of the effort is straight
    traditional blues, without any indie flair or flavor to it (apart from Sparhawk's
    indie-cred).  It can be pretty entertaining if you're in the right mindset, but
    it's nothing Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Willie Dixon or Robert Johnson haven't
    already done, and done better.</p></div>"|755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/755-its-the-black-eyed-snakes/|7.5|Brad Haywood

Don't listen to them-- the shit is metal.  What's worse,
    it's metal that denies you that payoff that comes with a corny, bloody-fingered
    guitar solo you can direct your frustration and derisive laughter at. In fact,
    there's not much to laugh about here at all. Unless boring, trebly, palm-muted
    guitar riffs and really, really bad emo screaming are particularly funny to you.</p><p>
    
    The obligatory: Anasarca was a D.C.-area five piece that recorded very little in
    their three-year existence, yet somehow managed to earn themselves a substantial
    fanbase and subsequent ""influential"" status. And influential they are. The music
    on this seven-song retrospective will definitely influence me to drop their CD
    into the garbage incinerator chute on my next trip to the elevator.</p><p>
    
    In discussing why it is I despise Anasarca, there are two main issues that
    merit attention: the music and the singing. To their credit, guitarists Chris
    Afzal and Carl Riddle-- and even the rhythm section of bassist Jim Sajor and
    drummer Mike Weltz-- churn out standard, sometimes even kinda pretty metal-core
    background music.  The kind that could get you hopping around and pumping your
    fist if you were into baseball caps, no-girls-allowed-type shows in small,
    sweaty venues, and being an angry, WASPy teen.  <i>Not</i> to their credit, on
    the other hand, is Nick Pimentel's hellishly silly voice, which lets the steam
    out of the other four guys' boring but at least thought-out musical
    arrangements.</p><p>
    
    Remember Cobra Commander from the ""G.I. Joe"" cartoons?  (Hint: he was the one
    with no face, screeching like his voicebox was on fire.) You might have assumed
    that all this time he was living off the residuals from his glory days.  Or
    maybe you thought he'd fallen through the social service cracks and resorted
    to squeegeeing motorists' windshields for spare change at a random inner-city
    intersection. Anything is possible, but we know for sure what he was doing from
    1994-1997: he was Nick Pimentel, frontman for Anasarca.  Granted, his abrasive
    ""I-don't-do-notes""-style singing has, since 1997, become an established vocal
    genre of its own.  But I personally see no reason to explore the roots of this
    fine tradition.</p><p>
    
    To the songs, then. ""East Bunk Hill"" and ""Eugene Debs"" are the first and second
    tracks, but are so similar that we'll just speak of them as one: Stop-start-stop.
    ""Aaaaiiighhhhyyyyeeeee!!!"" Stop-start-stop. ""Grgrgrgreeeeeeee!!!"" The guitars
    drop out, then the bass plays some non-committal but vaguely ominous part for a
    few bars. ""Aaaahhhhhhkkkkghhh!!!""</p><p>
    
    Things get appreciably better on track three, ""Everything Was Beautiful and
    Nothing Hurt,"" though maybe ""A Couple Things Weren't Awful but the Vocals
    Still Hurt"" would have been a more honest song title.  This song, as distinct
    from its two predecessors, actually makes use of melody! It even sports a clever,
    building intro, lively drumming, and a two-vocal part.</p><p>
    
    Track four, ""Stationary People,"" also flirts with singability in a fairly
    pleasant manner. You <i>almost</i> wonder if there's more to Anasarca than
    their half-hour discography suggests.  Which isn't to say the track is great.
    It sounds sort of like the demon from <i>The Exorcist</i> covering an Offspring
    song, but whatever.  Shit looks tall when you're in a crater this deep.</p><p>
    
    ""Enginize"" starts off positively wussy.  Was Anasarca having a rough day?  We
    don't know.  But in any case, the song's intro is the prettiest moment in the
    band's whole history.  Of course, you can guess what comes next:
    ""Aaaaiiighhhhyyyyeeeee!!!""  Good, you've been paying attention. Of the seven
    songs, this track earns silver honors.</p><p>
    
    ""You Know"" and ""So Tell Me"" finish things out in monotonously rockin' fashion,
    the former showing flashes of guitar-player consciousness; the latter earning
    the first place with its rare dynamism and the successful two-voice arrangement.
    And then... sweet silence. If you're a fan of this genre, save yourself the
    trouble of e-mailing me your thoughts, add another bunch of points to the
    rating, and enjoy.  If you're not, just remember Cobra Commando.  Knowing, my
    friends, is half the battle.</p></div>"|176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/176-discography-1994-1997/|4.8|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    are <i>Pitchfork</i> advertisers, keeping us staffers in turtlenecks and knickers
    well into the new year. But this palm-greasing in no way affected my estimation
    of <i>Home of the Cannon Saints</i>, and I can, with a clear conscience, say
    that this is THE BEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME and Red Shirt Brigade are BETTER THAN
    THE BEATLES... hell, they're even better than Badfinger.</p><p>
<i>(Okay, boys, how's that for quotes for your press kit?  On a completely
    unrelated note, I accept Paypal and credit cards payment through Billpoint, just
    so you know.)</i></p><p>
    
    All sarcasm aside, this actually is a pretty damn good album. Not groundbreaking
    or revolutionary, but intelligent, full of hooks, cheesy yet fun keyboards, and
    a lot of energy that manages to steer clear of angst or emo-boy whining. It's
    the kind of solid album you listen to on a cold winter's day and easily get lost
    in its bright, unaffected exuberance and forget about your worries for awhile.</p><p>
    
    Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla produced <i>Cannon Saints</i> which goes a long
    way toward describing Red Shirt Brigade's sound. They display the same kind of
    smart melodicism and rhythmic variety that keeps things consistently interesting,
    even though they're operating within a relatively narrow framework-- that is,
    punkish pop/rock played on bass, drums, guitar, and keyboards.</p><p>
<i>Home of the Cannon Saints</i> starts off with a minute-long drone before the
    first proper song, ""Thugs with Venom,"" which is album's best track.  Tempo
    changes flow gracefully from one to the next, and bright, angular guitar lines
    are balanced with genuine fist-pumping moments of distortion and riffage. It's
    accessible without being watered down or simple. In a kinder world, it might
    even make commercial radio.</p><p>
    
    But <i>Cannon Saints</i> doesn't blow its wad right away; there are other
    pleasures to be had here. The very next track, ""Later on in the Whole Word,""
    with its waltzing rhythm, somehow brings both Nirvana and Wings to mind, in the
    same way that Dismemberment Plan sounds like both Genesis and James Brown.
    Likewise, ""Years of Skulls,"" sounds like an imagined Dave Brubeck foray into
    modern rock with Morrissey at the mic: very precise, almost cold, but infectious,
    its melody setting up shop in your brain and staying there.</p><p>
    
    Dismemberment Plan offers a good overall point of comparison to Red Shirt
    Brigade's sound. The young band obviously took notes while listening to
    <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>, expounding on the feel of the Plan's masterpiece and
    capturing a lot of its energy without sounding too derivative. But while the
    Dismemberment Plan is fronted by one of the most charismatic and creative
    singers in the biz, Red Shirt Brigade lack a similar strong, confident leading
    personality as yet. But, then again, on the Dismemberment Plan's debut disc,
    Travis Morrison hadn't really found his voice yet, either. And that's the
    feeling <i>Cannon Saints</i> leaves you with: a lot of potential, but just not
    quite there yet.</p></div>"|6721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6721-home-of-the-cannon-saints/|7.1|Jason Nickey

    pop song. Part of the pop equation relies on a sense of spontaneity that has
    become increasingly elusive as listeners have now had, debatably, seventy-five
    years to construct an emotional immunity to the same unvarying formula. There
    are always those who will invert the standard for successful songwriting, leaving
    the accessibility to the less daring. Then there are those who acknowledge the
    inescapable grasp and scope of their musical heritage and imbue their own music
    with enough inventiveness to endure repeated discriminating listens.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, many seemingly creative bands merely stumble upon whatever unique
    sonic deviations earmark their respective ""sound"" and, once they have it patented,
    infuse it with every damn Beatles/Chuck Berry regurgitation they write. So it
    should be said that while an original technique is an occasional indicator of
    true talent (i.e. Phil Elvrum and his affinity for right/left channel panning
    guitars) true judgment should be reserved for the frequency in which you actually
    listen to the artist's recorded output. This is the best way to delineate between
    talent and plain sticktuitiveness. So what do you do with all those outstanding
    songs mired in between album-filler and the token ballad attempt? You make a mix
    tape.</p><p>
    
    Orion Walker expresses his love of mix tapes in the liner notes of the soundtrack
    to his film, <i>Dean Quixote</i>. ""There's a lot of great music being made... but
    you'll never hear this music unless you look for it. Or unless you're lucky
    enough to have a friend that makes you a mix tape..."" Indeed, Orion Walker seems
    to be a man of sage-like advice and the psychedelic murmuring of his mix tape
    to us, his audience, only reinforces the notion that he's a thinking man's man
    and his taste is nigh impeccable.</p><p>
    
    The album commences with the Olivia Tremor Control's ""Jumping Fences"" which,
    after nearly five years, still evokes the same paradoxical euphoric dystopia as
    it did on <i>Dusk at Cubist Castle</i>. There is no conceptual analysis of
    the modern pop song to be found, as on <i>Black Foliage</i>-- just Will Cullen
    Hart and Bill Doss stretching their comparative musical muscles and setting the
    ambience for the vast majority of the record.</p><p>
    
    Elephant Six dignitary Robert Schneider seems to pop up randomly throughout the
    course of the album. His band, the Apples in Stereo, are well represented with
    the inclusion of ""What Happened Then"" from the hit-and-miss <i>Discovery of a
    World Inside the Moone</i>, and his Orchestre Fantastique offer up the film's
    theme, ""Stars on the Sea.""  All said, Orchestre Fantastique sounds like
    incidental music for 70s educational programming, but within the context of the
    album, its breeziness is easily overlooked-- especially when compared to the
    Beachwood Sparks' ""This is What It Feels Like (Alt. Version)."" Both of these
    tracks, which would normally undergo a far more jaded critical knife, actually
    provide a fair definition for the album: a group of artists offering their
    winning interpretations of the ""archetypal pop song.""</p><p>
    
    The Minders turn out a piece that's not entirely dissimilar from what Nick Drake's
    instrumental ""Bryter Layter"" would sound like if interpreted as elevator music,
    and Spink (whose name should really be changed if they wish to gain an ounce of
    respect) cover the Palace Brothers' classic ""New Partner."" Elsewhere, Songs: Ohia
    stay around just long enough to infect your blood with the catchy-as-all-hell
    ""Hot Black Silk."" Though it may be impossible for Jason Molina to escape the
    Will Oldham comparisons, he shows here that he has the range (musically and
    vocally) to transcend a few of those stylistic similarities.</p><p>
    
    The remainder of the album is similarly engaging. Robert Pollard, who is
    supposedly close friends with Walker, appears in the film and donates the
    underrated gem ""If We Wait"" from the generous ten-song <i>Sunfish Holy Breakfast</i>
    EP.  And, like such revivalist luminaries as Goldfrapp and the Squirrel Nut
    Zippers in their more sultry moments, Crystal Keith and Kim Fox come to the
    radical conclusion that the seduction of lounge music didn't die in the 40s
    with their contribution, ""O What a Noble Mind Is Here Overthrown.""</p><p>
    
    I'm glad to say that I haven't seen <i>Dean Quixote</i>. Hearing these songs free
    of their intended context seems to have nourished the area of my brain that would
    have been deprived of stimulation had I watched this film at the local art house.
    So I'm taking the purist's route. The visualizations I've conjured up are more
    fantastic than anything that can be committed to celluloid. Life just can't be
    contained in 24-frames-a-second, and rather than have the film inspire the
    soundtrack, I've allowed the music to catalyze my generally dormant creativity.
    The only flaw in my plan: my expectations for the actual film have far exceeded
    the very constraints of cinema. This soundtrack has ruined it all for me.</p></div>"|7861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7861-dean-quixote-sdtk/|8.1|Kevin Adickes

    his proposed sitcom never got off the ground. ""The only thing that kept us off
    the air was that they wanted to do it with a laugh track, and I wanted to do it
    with a live audience. That was the only way they were going to sell me,"" he says.
    ""What would have happened was you'd make that exchange; the writing of that
    character becomes broader... because I'm pushing the envelope to get laughs,
    because instinctively I know how to work an audience, I know where to go.""</p><p>
    
    To some, it might seem like Black is being a little picky, yet another victim of
    the ages-old beggars-can't-be-choosers rhetoric. But anyone who's ever stood
    before a crowd of onlookers-- be they eight or 800-- and performed, knows the
    difference an audience makes. For many, the audience is a terrifying factor; one
    they'll do almost anything to avoid. But for a select few, the audience is as
    necessary to the creative process as watermelons and giant hammers are to
    Gallagher (to stick with the stand-up theme). It's the catalyst that kicks them
    into gear, starts the adrenaline pumping, and allows them to tell jokes, play
    music, dance, act, or do whatever it is they do on a level they'd be incapable
    of reaching otherwise.</p><p>
    
    Bullfrog, a Canadian band gaining crazy-style exposure thanks to their turntablist,
    Eric ""Kid Koala"" San, would seem to fit into this latter category. Ever since I
    came to the conclusion a while back that Koala is God's gift to the turntable,
    I've made a point of collecting recordings and catching him wherever I can. And
    I must say, that when it comes to live performance, his band Bullfrog puts on a
    hell of a show, stepping up from their backing role on Koala's <i>Carpal Tunnel
    Syndrome</i> and generally holding their own.</p><p>
    
    Bullfrog's music isn't anything stupendously original (they function as a
    laid-back combination of hip-hop, funk, R&amp;B;, and Phish-y hippie music, not
    unlike, say, G. Love and Special Sauce), nor are their lyrics particularly
    demanding (despite song titles like ""Ya Ya"" and ""Ababa"" which might suggest
    otherwise), and the content rarely elevates above standard party-rockin',
    good-time-havin' fare.  By all logic, Bullfrog should suck royally. But
    something about the live performance galvanizes the band. Live, they're on
    top of their game, a great party band, and ready to start the motors of even
    the most initially indifferent crowd.</p><p>
    
    But when it comes to recorded music... well, maybe Bullfrog should've taken a
    cue from Lewis Black. Try though they might to capture the spirit of their live
    performances, the generally lackluster nature of Bullfrog's self-titled debut
    proves that the band just isn't the same without an audience to play to. Sure,
    Bullfrog has its moments. ""Slow Down"" is nice enough, teetering between a
    cappella 50s-pop and laid-back reggae-inspired jam-band fare; ""Bullfrog Theme""
    carries a certain confidence not present elsewhere in the album; and Kid Koala's
    collage intermission ""Extra Track II"" is a fun mockery of music industry politics.
    Unfortunately, these are the exceptions, not the rule. Though all six members of
    the group remain technically proficient or better, they generally lack the energy
    and passion in a recording session that makes their live show so much fun.</p><p>
    
    One gets the feeling that someone at Atlantic realized this at some point as--
    presumably to capture some of the energy of the live show-- someone has taken
    the liberty of peppering this recipe with various clips from live performances.
    However, the recording quality of Bullfrog's live content is, to put it gently,
    fucking terrible. Many of the live tracks stop or start at awkward moments in
    the middle of songs, vocals echo across rooms, much of the content sounds canned
    and muffled, and Koala's contributions are often mixed far too low, making them
    impossible to hear over rollicking drums. Rather than adding spice to the flavor,
    these tracks stand out like an ugly hair at the bottom of your soup.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, this package reeks of having been thrown together on the run (no
    doubt in an attempt to capitalize on Koala's Touring-With-Radiohead status
    before the Yorke groupies forgot his name). And while its tough to criticize a
    band for attempting to grab hold at what's likely their best bet for success,
    it's a damned shame it had to go like this. They may not be the most amazing
    band in the world, but Bullfrog deserves better than this. Maybe the future will
    bring us a proper live album from this band, but in the meantime, potential
    listeners would be better suited holding their breath till the band rolls into
    town.</p></div>"|1018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1018-bullfrog/|5.6|David M. Pecoraro

At least it wasn't held in the
    office.  But Schreiber wouldn't pay for train fare and Chicago was fucking
    freezing and I got so many dirty propositions that the walk felt like the Senate
    antechamber.  I wasn't interested in Martin(a) and her ""package deal,"" though,
    so I ducked into the VFW Hall.  All the new kids were gathered around the
    punchbowl, making small talk and ladling nervously.  I circled the room,
    browsing conversations: Richard-San was pitching the fork like a grizzled sea
    veteran with Paul Cooper nodding politely, Sage was pouring liberal amounts of
    scotch, and Buckman and Leone were talking gibberish about ""Yamatsuka"" and
    ""Kawabata.""  Ethan P. was up in John Dark's face about something, but I didn't
    want to get involved.  Someone was missing, but I couldn't remember who.</p><p>
    
    The party improved after alcohol was drunk and Avalanches were played.  Fueled
    by some gin and too little tonic, I started to wander.  Turning the corner, I
    came face-to-face with some indie kid-- the cocked eyebrow, baggy trousers and
    tongue poised to spit words like ""motorik"" marked him as from either the
    Fakejazz or Splendidezine conventions down the hall, for sure-- but we passed
    with little more than the ""industry nod.""  Down in the next wing, the strains of
    some sick sound caught my ears, like a ghost bored into domestication.  The sign
    on the door said ""International Association of Muzak Licensers and Muzak
    Engineers: Annual Meeting.""  I slipped inside and stood up against the wall.</p><p>
    
    ""Are your clients tired of traditional Muzak?  Need a new way to capture your
    customer's brand loyalty?  Gen-X has been tuning out our messages for years; it
    just isn't receptive to edutainment anymore.  But there is a solution.  La
    Makita Soma is Muzak for the filtered generation, designed specifically to rock
    out and yet keep the profits rolling on in.  I understand they call this
    'post-rock' here in the Windy City.  You've got jolly little keyboard melodies,
    merry vibraphones humming in time, and drum crashes in all the right places.
    Every sound is carefully leveled out in the production process, leaving the
    results smooth and synthesized.  And darn if that guitar solo doesn't match the
    best Muzak classics-- I'm hearing Santana's 'Everything is Coming Our Way!'""</p><p>
    
    Oh god, it was awful.  Kraftwerk posing as kinky robot fetishists was one thing,
    but I've never heard a group of musicians so pleased to sound like a Casio
    keyboard demo.  It was like they'd boiled instrumental rock down until anything
    remotely lively and threatening had evaporated, and the distilled essence of
    suck just oozed out of the speakers like medicinal syrup.  The pseudo-psychedelic
    jam on ""Glossalalia at 47th"" made me wonder if I'd downed a valium.  The entire
    Prozac Nation might still be bored by this roofie-rock.  Oh yeah, and there's a
    sample of kids playing at the beginning of the title track.  Kids.  Playing.  I
    was just coming to understand the need for mood medication when I heard it:
    <i>dink dink dink</i>.</p><p>
    
    ""That's right, folks, 'The Makita Five' even comes up with a new musical genre!
    We call it 'electroniska,' because it has the lilting upbeat of ska music.
    That's a twelve-minute song with enough wild solos and calm segments to satisfy
    consumers and investors alike!  After all, there's nothing like a little reggae
    to spruce your step when you're 'Lost in the Supermarket,' eh?  Get it?""</p><p>
    
    The ska riffs stabbed into my mind on and on and on, but they were far from
    halcyon.  The label reps kept referring to <i>Brighton Park</i> as techno, but
    it sounded like the downfall of western civilization to me.  They'd used pedals
    as general anesthetic, delay and reverb and wah-wah all combining into a soupy
    mixture spilling out of the busted cornucopia of third-rate Tortoise bargain
    basement jams.  Then a woman asked a question:</p><p>
    
    ""How will La Makita Soma affect the market in light of the new wave of recordings?
    We're nearly finished with the Specials' <i>Gangsters</i>.  Will the release of
    <i>Brighton Park</i> hurt our Return-on-Investment for <i>Rat Race</i>?""</p><p>
    
    The guy chuckled.  ""La Makita Soma cares about demographics, ma'am.  That's why
    we've included a rapper on 'Spaceship.'  Hi-Fidel will broaden your outreach
    sector when he talks about 'Reptiles armed with projectiles/ Criss-cross in the
    night sky like African textiles.'  There's your urban and science fiction markets
    in one verse!""</p><p>
    
    I spun and ran back to the welcoming arms of Daft Punk or whatever it was the
    staffers were playing.  Brent Sirota looked me right in the eyes and shook his
    head.  He knew, and maybe O'Rourke did, too.  The new year didn't look so bright
    anymore.</p></div>"|4614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4614-brighton-park/|2.9|Christopher Dare

The wrong set of pipes can
    ruin a sound; the right one can elevate the emotion of the music beyond any meaning in the lyrics.  It
    also goes without saying that there are plenty of people out there who can't really sing in what we'd think
    of as a traditional sense.  Carrying a tune seems simple enough, but it's remarkable to consider just how
    many voices out there aren't built for it.</p><p>
    Bevel is the solo project of Drunk's Via Nuon, and let's just say that he's one of those millions of people
    who wasn't endowed with a naturally melodic larynx.  Part of the problem seems to be in his delivery-- he
    doesn't project at all, and notes can even get lost as he trails off.  On the other side of the coin, though,
    he's a fantastic guitarist, and he can be mesmerizing when he wields his acoustic.</p><p>
    And so it follows that, somehow, Nuon's lackluster vocal performance doesn't really get in the way that much
    on his debut release as Bevel.  He's composed 13 different paths down the folkways of America, and the
    haunted nature of the music usually allows his sometimes downright antimelodic delivery to settle in and
    get the job done, however awkwardly.  It certainly helps that he's joined by fifteen high caliber musicians,
    from members of Souled American, Lambchop, and Dirty Three to Chicago session players like Fred
    Lonberg-Holm, Jessica Billey, Jason Adiesewicz, and Michael Krassner, who've played on records ranging
    from Pinetop Seven to Edith Frost to Wilco.</p><p>
    Yet even with all that talent, there's nothing flashy about <i>Where Leaves Block the Sun</i>.  Instead, it
    prefers to stay on the periphery, decorating your atmosphere in much the same way that a real bevel might
    lend character to a piece of wooden furniture.  It opens with a gorgeous acoustic guitar instrumental called
    ""Exitrance,"" setting up the orange and brown autumnal theme of the music with its thoughtful melody and warm
    fingerpicking.</p><p>
    ""Generosity"" is the first song to feature Nuon's voice as he tackles an oddly singsong melody as best he can
    over a textured background of vibes and guitar.  'Textural' is the operative descriptor from here on out, as
    virtually every song explores some variation on a basic acoustic musical texture.  By and large, the days
    get a little shorter toward the middle of the album, as the darkest textures are explored there.  Icy pianos
    spread like frost around warmly bowed violins, and Steven Dorocke's steel guitar occasionally rises in the
    background like steam rising off a mug of cocoa.</p><p>
    While his singing may not be amazing, Nuon does manage some fine lyrical moments, such as the line, ""Every
    engineer hates every other engineer's work,"" from the middle of the wasted ""Liquid Burns.""  ""Siberian
    Sunrise"" lives up to its title, with sprightly little guitar melodies trickling over a frozen, droning
    tundra like the first rays stretching across a frigid wasteland.  And the instrumental ""Theme for Harold""
    may as well be the Siberian Sunset, as everything is plunged back into darkness and bitter cold.</p><p>
    Perhaps the most unpretentiously beautiful moment on the album, though, is ""Oklahoma,"" a brief, 1\xBD-minute
    interlude featuring nothing but Michael Krassner's starkly recorded piano set alongside what sounds like a
    field recording of a supermarket parking lot.  It's a truly transcendent moment that perfectly sets up the
    final track, ""Prologue of the Recalcitrance.""  Here, Nuon offers a fractured verse over an improvised
    backing before simply turning the musicians loose, ending the album on a chaotic yet consonant note.</p><p>
<i>Where Leaves Block the Sun</i> is an ephemeral pleasure, much like walking beneath the changing foliage
    of fall and feeling those first few stiff, cold breezes of the year.  Bevel never strive to drive anything
    home, instead offering it to you and letting you decide what you want to take with you.  And while that's
    appealing in its own way, this is certainly not an album to throw on just any old time.  On certain occasions,
    however, it will work nicely at night.  Especially when the leaves are turning.</p></div>"|681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/681-where-leaves-block-the-sun/|7.0|Joe Tangari

It
    happens to the best at some point or another.  Maybe they rebound (Dylan, Costello), maybe they don't
    (McCartney, Prince), but it's telling that, as listeners, we often fall into the trap of treating our music
    like amusement park rides, expecting bigger and better thrills with each passing year.  Now, I'm not arguing
    for constant entertainment; a saturated experience that fills voids we didn't even know existed.  And despite
    the perennial letdowns, I wouldn't expect these musicians to take critical reactions any more seriously than
    television static.  A million critics <i>can</i> be wrong-- just ask the next person who isn't fooled into
    believing prog is inherently bad.  (Quick, there's another one!)  But would it be too much to ask for a new
    wrinkle now and then?</p><p>
    Guitarist Robert Fripp formed King Crimson in 1969 with Michael Giles, Ian McDonald, and future-total-embarrassment
    Greg Lake.  Their debut record, featuring brooding Mellotron, dark, epic, ballads, and Fripp's signature
    brainiac-laser guitar lines (especially on the classic rave-up  ""21st Century Schizoid Man"") helped define
    progressive rock in its earliest stages, and is still held as one of the most important records of the genre
    today.  In the 70s, the band worked through various lineups, and eventually settled on a group featuring
    Fripp, ex-Yes drummer Bill Bruford, John Wetton, and David Cross (not the bald comic).  That band managed
    to almost single-handedly defy all stereotypes thrown at prog, not only by being one of its greatest proponents
    of free improvisation, but also by just rocking the hell out of the world's concert halls.  In the 80s, Fripp
    brought in guitarist/vocalist Adrian Belew and turned the band into a tightly wound New Wave machine--
    imagine Talking Heads crossed with Don Cab.  And in the 90s, the band mixed and matched <i>all</i> of these
    sounds, pleasing pretty much their entire devoted fanbase.  Until now.</p><p>
    You see, the problem with <i>Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With</i>-- a compilation of new stuff,
    studio pisstakes and one live track released to satiate the poor-fan's crave until next year's full-length--
    isn't that King Crimson have abandoned their sound or moved away from what made them so interesting, but
    that it's a culmination of the last few years' stagnation.  From the ""Frippertronics"" (Fripp's patented
    ambient guitar technique), to the ""eclectic"" percussion instrumental, to the ""funny"" ""blues"" ""tune"", there's
    a not-so-thin film of decay drenching almost every moment on this set.  The two new ideas-- the first being
    the title track's depressingly out-of-touch stab at xFC-metal; the second being the studio cut-n-paste of
    ""Einstein's Relatives""-- seem, by turns, desperate and unnecessary.  2000's <i>The Construkction of Light</i>
    hinted at complacency, but was at least energetic.</p><p>
    The title track is the worst offender on the record, opting for ham-fisted satire of bands that King Crimson
    shouldn't even be aware of (they toured with Tool recently, and I can only imagine the late-night hilarity
    on that tourbus) at the great expense of the jam.  ""I have some words/ This is the way I'll sing/ Through a
    distortion box/ To make them menacing,"" sings Belew.  Ha ha, he sure did bite Korn there-- next up, King
    Crimson exposes the idiocy of Milli Vanilli and 50s game shows.  Belew throws in a few practice rounds on
    auto-harmonizer just to show he's still got Peter Frampton's number, and ""Potato Pie"" is the embodiment of
    filler.</p><p>
    Perhaps even more frustrating, there are some okay songs, too: ""Mie Gakure"" may be old-hat ambience for
    Fripp, but it's nice nonetheless; Belew's ""Eyes Wide Open"" proves that he is the world's finest imitator
    of a David Byrne/John Lennon hybrid mutant, and that he can write a pleasant hook when called for (even if
    the song does recall moments from just about every Crimson record on which he's appeared).  But alas, these
    are drops in an increasingly empty bucket.  Better to burn out than fade away?  Say it ain't so.</p></div>"|4442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4442-happy-with-what-you-have-to-be-happy-with/|3.9|Dominique Leone

Oxbow, apostles from that small seam of
    true, gut-wrenching horror.  Oxbow, who stink of phlegm and germs and unprotected sex.  Oxbow, whose live
    shows frighten even the few converts who've come to see.  Hard music born of slow, corruptive bile from
    deep down inside, not the tantrums of chugging cheerleaders of doom.  They'll put the lie to your grindcore
    bands right quick.</p><p>
    
    With titles like ""King of the Jews"" and ""The Balls in the Great Meat Grinder Collection,"" it's not hard to
    fathom Oxbow's lack of fame.  But you'd think the foursome would at least be known for their frontman-- if
    only for the hecklers he's beaten down in his day.  There are few spectacles like Eugene Robinson, more
    than six feet of black muscle standing downstage, thighs spread, brief-clad crotch thrusting forward, eyes
    rolling in holy fervor.  The crowd steps back a few feet and eyes the exits.</p><p>
    
    The two-track opener, ""The Snake &amp; The Stick,"" finds him perched in the pulpit more than ever before.
    Cursing, shouting, screaming from the background, his cries come like those from the drunks you see
    stalking down the street, lost in their own private stew of hate.  At the same time, he whispers up
    close with allure: ""One Sunday morning, the preacher went a-trawling/ To the House of Fuck, he come
    a-calling.""  A raspy voice admits, ""I got couch sluts of every stripe, sir, boys and girls and the
    in-between types,"" and right afterwards the band busts into an exaltation of Sabbath riffage.  Might as
    well strip your clothes off, burn your Preacher comics and bask in the squalor because Garth Ennis ain't
    never going to come close to this freaky.</p><p>
    
    In times past, Oxbow sounded somewhat like labelmates Neurosis, or a spoiled Birthday Party.  <i>An Evil
    Heat</i> cools the fire just enough for a slower burn.  The main hooks of these songs seem blues-based, at
    least at the beginning, as you're reeled in.  ""Stallkicker"" opens with a rough blues crunch, and the cymbal
    crashes resonate like electric shocks.  It even ends with a brief coda of almost pretty guitar picking.
    But they return to their trademark queasiness-- a sidelong slither between noise-rock and metal-- on ""S
    Bar X,"" on which former Swan member Jarboe guests.  Her low moans circle his high-pitched keens until it
    all mashes together in a swirl of seething feedback.</p><p>
    
    Given all the old folktales of forks in the road and deals made at midnight, the whiff of blues here makes
    sense.  Scent-words seem to be the most appropriate; there's an odor of pheromonal aggression that's just
    tangible on this record, and it alternately sickens and succors.  Rarely have I been so thoroughly seduced
    after an averse reaction, and rarely have I been so driven to get up and thrash around and feel the blood
    pulse through my veins.  ""Skin,"" in particular, grips me until I'm aware of the sad state of my own flesh,
    what with the brutal whip of the snare and the tale of ""the cockhorse, teeth like sugar cubes/ Play the
    blues, balls hanging/ Between his between, like crab apples... hating his hide, and hiding his hate/
    Potentate of the small, and the great.""</p><p>
    
    What wages do you earn after the sins of the first half-hour?  The other half: a thirty-two minute (near)
    instrumental by the name of ""Shine(Glimmer).""  It builds in buzzing bass drones and dives back down into
    distortion, endlessly climaxing and clenching up and coming at you again.  It's a primal jam, fueled by
    pure carnal libido, so get together with some inclined bodies and slap skin together.  <i>An Evil Heat</i>
    may not be for everyone, but you're going to keep an open ear-- it's been too long since you've listened to
    anything this hard.  So kneel yourself down now, and look upwards at old Eugene.  It's time for your

It's not     some underground classic, but their mix of sharp rhythms and relentless rhymes     made for a tight debut, even if it left a cold, chemical aftertaste.  I'm not     coming all ""saviors of hip-hop""-- Wisdom had a point: too many loops made for     monotonous grooves, and their dense wordflow tried too hard to intimidate.     Overly bleak maybe, but not surprising; hell, Anti-Popper Beans even cites     Bauhaus and Section 25 as influences.  But along with Mike Ladd's Parliament-ary     <em>Afterfuture</em> and the Infesticons' <em>Gun Hill Road</em>, <em>Tragic Epilogue</em> was one of those mindtrip albums of 2000 that could send you to a heaven at least     somewhere in the 7.0s.</p><p>So hopefully we can give props to the Consortium while avoiding some internecine     staffer warfare.  Anti-Pop's on Warp now, and for a second you might think the     label's looking to duplicate the success of Cannibal Ox.  ""Tuff Gong"" fires off     rattling tin can percussion and a raw, bombastic bassline reminiscent of everything     on <em>The Cold Vein</em>.  M. Sayyid spits some typical insults at first, but then     the song cuts to this organic double-bass skronk and he doubletimes, tongue     almost audibly flapping.  He balances precariously, nearly losing it, but ends     on point with, ""You pulled out a nine/ I turned into a green light and ran over     your mind.""</p><p>""Tuff Gong"" is clearly an intro track, and ""Splinter"" follows seamlessly with     some duke-duke-duke of earl-style vocals and a nice, understated keyboard melody.     Beans' warm voice begins, ""Fillin' em with penicillin and Benadryl/ Drillin' a     fillin' and spillin' my feelings.""  His delivery's always smooth but I'm struck     by the excitement-- nobody's detached like the last joint.  Likewise, M. Sayyid     snarls eagerly, ""I got crowds movin' like U.N. flags.""  Somebody's got to fall     off though, and here, it's High Priest.  You can pinpoint right when his freestyle     degenerates into a bastardized Kool-Keith grocery-list recitation, the kind of     flat flow that heads always hate in ""progressive"" hip-hop.</p>
<p>But Priest redeems-- regular Anti-Pop producer Earl Blaize steps back to the     engineer role for this EP, and each of the three MCs get a chance to shine on     their own tracks.  Priest proves the skills that got him on Mille Plateaux's     click-hop comps.  He crafts ""39303"" from random beeps and babbling samples,     mixing it all together suddenly as Beans launches into an abstract monologue.     It cuts off too quickly, probably the only problem with this EP: most tracks     just seem sketches.  But Priest's next piece, ""Pit,"" distracts attention once     again with an instrumental full of divebombing pitchshifts that squeak like     Kraftwerkian birds of paradise.  Beans' ""Dystopian Disco Force"" and M. Sayyid's     ""Perpendicular"" go the more mainstream route.  The latter develops into a DJ     Muggs-style trip-hop ditty, and the former is straight-up funk, organ runs and     wah-wah guitars included.</p>
<p>Were there any instrumentals at all on <em>Tragic Epilogue</em>?  Must have slept     through them, if so.  But this EP just constantly keeps your head bobbing.     They've extended the challenges of vocal freestyle to the music, and the     improvised weirdness avoids the dull loops <em>Epilogue</em> fell into.  ""Vector""     ends with another vocal track and the upbeat meter is perfect (likewise the     buoyant, humming Moog).  The Consortium seems to have learned that Anti-Pop     doesn't equal mind-numbing, machine-like music.  I'm just hoping the experimental     tip transfers to their new album in 2002.  <em>The Ends Against the Middle</em> is     only a 17-minute EP, but unlike their fast-forward-guy logo, when this finishes,     I'm ready to rewind.</p></div>"|210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/210-the-ends-against-the-middle-ep/|7.4|Christopher Dare

Well, they sound like they're trying
    to play everything, anyway.  I don't mean to say that the music is necessarily
    jumbled-- they generally avoid the postmodern pitfall of cramming a hundred ideas
    into one song.  Instead, this band takes a few dozen ideas, catalogs them, and
    creates lots of little postcards to paste into their album.   Only the postcards
    are the songs (except when they're actually cards, like the inserts that come
    with this album), and the eclectic ideas seem either ill-suited to the band's
    strengths (hazy psyche-pop, as far as I can tell) or simply beyond the range of
    their abilities to pull off.  And while I admire any band willing to bring a
    little eclecticism to the mix, what I hear as the failure to cover bases set
    forth in the music is a disappointment.</p><p>
<i>Katastrophe Vol. 3</i> is Zmrzlina's third release.  I should give my respects
    to whoever designed the packaging, because it's rather amazing.  All futuristic
    art-deco and matte coloring, and featuring the aforementioned card inserts-- this
    is a project I imagine as much thought went into as the actual recordings.  In
    fact, I wonder how a band like this even has enough cash to create something like
    this, as publishing houses and art directors don't often come cheaply.  Design
    is credited to the group, so perhaps somebody internal had access to a printing
    press and some serious Adobe skills.  So, in summary, props to the designers.</p><p>
    As for the music, well, it's nothing if not good-natured.  Yet it's often
    amateurish where it should be accomplished, rough where it should be smooth, and
    goofy where it should be strange.  The first track, ""Supermarket Radio,"" begins
    promisingly enough with some eerie strings and a looped child(-like?) vocal.
    This is nice, something of a cross between Bernard Herrmann and Björk, but the
    song doesn't actually <i>begin</i> until the band enters about a minute in.
    Disco drums and some wah-wah guitar introduce the ""groove,"" and then everyone
    drops a mad Blondie beat so vocalist Jeff Ray can expound Fred Schneider style
    upon who knows what atrocities.  There's a running string-line throughout, and
    the band occasionally returns to the opening neatness.  However, I get the
    feeling that this is the kind of music that sounds better when you have a million
    bucks to fly a producer in from Iceland to clean up your mix and get a decent
    drum sound.  What it could be: high-gloss transient art-pop; what it is: flat,
    aimless upstart pop.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, on ""Schoolgirls,"" drummer/vocalist Heather Snider lends a gentle, airy
    lead to some fairly dull (where they should be punchy) strains.  The arrangement
    combines a terribly ""bouncy"" drum loop, laidback guitar strumming and a whipping
    violin line, thereby prompting me to play rock-critic and call this ""what
    folk-pop means in the 21st Century"" or possibly ""folktronica.""  But that game
    sucks, and in fact, this tune just sounds unfocused, ending with a long guitar
    solo that wouldn't have sounded out of place at Lynyrd Skynyrd show.</p><p>
    There are cool parts, too: ""Creek Lullaby"" gets the down-home groove right with
    some nice guitar picking and a relaxed beat, even managing to throw in a
    disorienting vocal loop.  The song is perfect for a light buzz, and it helps
    that the band doesn't stretch out this concept so long that I lose interest
    (which they do quite often on the rest of the album).  ""Kentucky,"" which features
    more of the annoying talk-singing from the first tune, manages to be too long and
    yet not dull in the slightest.  I give credit to Ralph Carney's moaning woodwinds
    (on loan from Tom Waits' band), and the fact that the stone-somber vibe I get
    from this tune suits Zmrzlina to a tee.  I'm telling you, if they put out an
    album of all psychedelic funeral marches, I'd buy it and like it.</p><p>
    Those are the high points on an album I would say is at least a few edits and/or
    omissions shy of something consistently interesting.  It's not that Zmrzlina
    aren't creative; for all I know, they're all great artists on the verge of the
    next big movement in rock.  But there comes a time when your grasp has to keep
    up with your reach if you want to inspire.  Of course, this doesn't happen
    everyday for artists, but when it does, people take notice and new classics are
    born.  Perhaps, <i>Katastrophe Vol. 3</i> is just a stepping stone to future
    greatness, or maybe just a misstep altogether.  Everything they're doing could
    be nice, given different contexts, but sometimes just everything isn't enough.</p></div>"|8935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8935-katastrophe-vol-3/|5.2|Dominique Leone

For one-time-carpenter-turned-unofficial-Beastie
    Boy Mark Ramos-Nishita, keeping up appearances alone is time consuming at best.
    When not collaborating with the aforementioned superstars, contributing his
    keyboarding aptitude to everyone from Femi Kuti and Santana to Mary Lou Lord,
    Money Mark writes, produces, and plays almost every instrument for his own solo
    releases.  His albums are increasingly becoming stereo standards for the slick
    bars and slicker parties where the patrons and guests have better hair, better
    credit, and more impressive portfolios (in every sense of the word) than you do.</p><p>
    
    But don't hold that against him. It's not Money's fault the high dollar tapas
    bar down the street plays his discs on endless repeat. If anything, <i>Change Is
    Coming</i> is a sort of musical guidebook for how to throw your own exclusive
    soiree in the privacy of your own home.</p><p>
    
    And no worries about the relative provincialism of your whereabouts. ""Information
    Contraband""-- the album's second track with its samba style beats, swirling
    traffic simulating keyboards, and <i>Ill Communication</i>-style downtown funk--
    creates a big city feel, perfect for that moment early in the party when all the
    guests have arrived, had at least two cocktails a piece, and have begun mingling
    loudly in your living room.</p><p>
    
    You'll want your first course to be sweet and sour, a conflicting, yet pleasant
    taste to complement the airy space-age-meets-metal-guitars-meets-sleazy-funk of
    ""Glitch in Da System."" Don't worry about scaring off your guests. The combination
    is unusual, though mild enough to be palatable, even in its moments of dissonance.</p><p>
    
    The high point of the evening comes with the main course: ""Another Day to Love
    You."" Money Mark would probably recommend something hot and spicy-- an excellent
    Paella, or some ingenious Cuban concoction-- guaranteed to get the guests riled
    up, perhaps for an impromptu dance halfway through the meal. ""Another Day to Love
    You"" sounds something like a 21st century revision on the Buena Vista Social Club,
    complete with jazzy piano and intricate Latin guitar. The combination is a little
    sexy. If at all possible, season it with an aphrodisiac, because things are gonna
    stay pretty steamy throughout the rest of the album.</p><p>
    
    Even on the dance numbers. ""People's Party (Red Alert)"" comes off like uptown
    disco, despite its jazzy horns and squealing flute. The crowd can migrate to the
    dancefloor to sweat off dinner before you serve dessert. Something with a tropical
    flavor is recommended to accompany the cruise-line Muzak of ""Use Your Head""--
    your guests are guaranteed to like it, even if you integrate leftovers. ""Use
    Your Head"" originally appeared on the 1996 <i>Red Hot</i> Compilation, <i>Red,
    Hot, and Rio</i>. Money Mark understands a great party doesn't always necessitate
    completely original material.</p><p>
    
    Bid farewell to your guests and get to work on those dishes with ""Rain (NYC).""
    The background recording of an actual rainshower will prove a soothing counterpart
    to your faucet. The melody here bears a remarkable resemblance to a certain
    George Gershwin penned standard/lullaby, especially when supplied by Ulises
    Bella's trill-heavy clarinet. So, even after all the excitement of the evening,
    falling asleep shouldn't be too much of a challenge.</p><p>
    
    A perfect party. A perfect soundtrack to your perfect party. You'll sleep like a
    baby, and inevitably wake to realize that <i>Change Is Coming</i> doesn't play
    so well by the light of day.  Stripped of its social-hour context, it sounds
    like a kitschy, ersatz reproduction of a Beastie Boys album without the vocals,
    and a little too much like that <i>Cocktail Nation</i> disc you found in the
    used rack at your favorite record shop for $3.00 a couple years back. You
    remember immediately why you bought that disc (""This is gonna be great at a
    party"") and why you never played it (""When do I have those kind of parties? In
    fact, do I even <i>want</i> to have those kind of parties?"")  And then you
    remember the novelty of <i>Mark's Keyboard Repair</i>. You liked it. You really
    did.  But this seems dull by comparison, hopelessly tied to the role of background
    music. And that's okay.  I mean, everybody needs good-- even exceptionally good--
    background music from time to time.  But is it really worth it to pay full price
    for this CD?</p><p>
    
    Here's another drawback: if you're not careful, you'll be expected to throw these
    parties again, and again, and again, regardless of the rapidly depleting funds in
    your bank account and the mysterious curry dust that has seemed to permanently
    settled over your whole kitchen. It's a bitch being so multi-talented-- an ideal
    host, an excellent chef, a friend to the stars, a masterful party DJ. Just ask
    Money Mark.</p></div>"|5395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5395-change-is-coming/|6.5|Alison Fields

    and interlocutor since Tsunami's final album, 1997's <i>A Brilliant Mistake</i>.
    She left her Simple Machines label to begin the Future of Music Coalition,
    putting herself in the precarious situation of being an devoted artist with no
    time for art.  Somewhere in the midst of these four years was catastrophic love--
    a heartbreak so tragic and special it warranted a double-disc. Both her pedigree
    and tendency for advice date her; these are not the tales of a wide-eyed youth.
    Yet, where time almost invariably wears on musicians, leaving them without so
    much as a shred of inspiration or cultural relevance, Toomey has remarkably
    managed the unmanageable: she's aged while maintaining her grace.</p><p>
<i>Antidote</i>'s 16 tracks range between bitter (""Patsy Cline"") to resigned
    (""When You Get Cold""), and borrow some of the best talent offered by the two
    cities each of these discs respectively represent: Chicago and Nashville.
    The Chicago disc features not the first names that come to mind when you think
    of the city, but arguably more interesting ones in these post-post-rock days:
    engineer and ex-Pulsars member David Trumfio, Trip Grey on drums, super-cellist
    Amy Domingues, Aluminum Group frontman John Navin, Drag City crooner Edith Frost,
    and violinist Andrew Bird (of Bowl of Fire fame).  Nashville artists Jean Cook
    and Lambchop member Mark Nevers (who has also engineered albums for Leann Rimes
    and Vic Chesnutt) fill out the lap-steel and slow, caramel-drip sadness of
    the Nashville disc.</p><p>
    The Nashville selections languish in the inflection of lost love. Long legatos,
    brushes, and sprinkles of piano color Toomey's ruminations, her voice recalling
    the punctuation of Natalie Merchant and the lilt of Sam Prekop-- full and strong
    without the sense of virtuosity that could ruin its context. By the third track,
    ""The Smell of Him,"" Toomey has proven the strength of her moodsetting; the song
    oozes style with soft angles and upright bass.  The steel-laden ""Artful Dodger""
    takes the most chances of these songs.  Toomey's vocals fall outside the beat,
    her melody picked above the slow procession of chords. It's a strange, Verve-like
    moment of violin tremolo and stylized country made all the stranger by Toomey's
    lyrics, unrhymed, articulate and serious.</p><p>
    The Chicago disc packs up the sad strains and sends them off on defiant bursts
    of horn, beating them with dance rhythms and washes of distortion.  It opens
    with ""Patsy Cline,"" a tongue-in-cheek advice column for ladies who love their
    pre-modern men. ""Clear Cut"" takes the borderline-cliché metaphor of doing away
    with love entirely and remodels it.  And ""Breezewood P.A."" pulls Toomey's
    cynicism to the fore with the opening lines, ""If I took advice from editors of
    certain teenage magazines that dictate style for teenage scenes and guidelines
    for romance/ I'd surely speak with more reserve on certain sparks."" All this in
    a showtune-style bed whose nuances call to mind Jim O'Rourke's willfully
    commercial pop solo work.</p><p>
    This disc almost seems a response to a questioning of her musical intent.  She
    answers by allowing her crew to convert simply good songs into great ones.  The
    band employs their greatest tricks-- Domingues' crescendos, which bend into
    subtly hooked guitar lines, are particularly affecting-- and the engineers mix
    songs like ""Charm City"" with sassy drop-outs and explosive horn sections.</p><p>
    When Toomey presented these new songs at Ladyfest Chicago, she explained that,
    ""They could all fit on one disc, space-wise, but really shouldn't be together
    stylistically at all. Don't think I'm ambitious because I took two."" Though her
    songwriting remains characteristic, the treatment given by each pack of musicians
    is worlds (if only time-zones) apart. If Nashville breathes deeper than Chicago,
    it's simply because Toomey's strength is her weakness, that her greatest lines
    aren't windy-city comebacks so much as those questioning the sincerity of love
    in the land of music.</p></div>"|8107.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8107-antidote/|8.4|Daphne Carr

    routines, and sometimes it takes the ""Jaws of Life"" to rip
    open the perceptive confines that coincide with a life of
    ritualism. You awake one morning to the braying tone of your
    alarm clock and drowsily reach over to turn the damn thing
    off, only to find that the established procedure for doing
    so causes no reaction. You press the ""Off"" button two or
    three more times to make sure you haven't made an error in
    judgment as your senses become more acute and your emotions
    inflame. Something has usurped the authority of logic,
    shattering your rationalizations of many wildly complex and
    confounding variables, and schooling you in ""possibility.""</p><p>
    
    Explosions in the Sky have elucidated these prevalent truths
    for me through their epic instrumental lamentations. Though
    the band are hardly the first iconoclasts of the revered
    ""verse-chorus-verse"" formula, theirs is a music of possibility
    like few others have dared to make. On their debut album,
    <i>How Strange, Innocence</i>, they brandished a sort of
    restraint that often teased listeners with visions of the
    group's capability were they only to let loose.  The
    bandname implies scorching collages of noise, yet most of
    their crescendos end in plucked strings and comforting,
    ambient gauze.</p><p>
    
    On their sophomore effort, the contradictorily titled <i>Those
    Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall
    Live Forever</i>, the group has recanted on their more
    unexcitable tendencies, opting to infuse their work with a
    formerly unseen rawness and intensity.  And even if it's
    not a didactic analysis of what constitutes ""music"" (such as
    the Olivia Tremor Control's <i>Black Foliage</i>), it
    certainly makes for a revelatory listen.</p><p>
    
    ""Greet Death"" opens the album innocuously enough with
    inaudible strumming that surfaces just long enough to be
    devastated by seething drums and scathing, distorted guitars.
    Such previously foreign abrasiveness is an immediate indicator
    that Explosions have rewritten their aesthetic principles
    while leaving their ability to wield a stark melody virtually
    unimpaired. As the dust clears and the sonic damage is
    assessed, the remaining feedback segues into a sober slide
    guitar, denoting a major transition in the song's emotional
    appeal.  The track ends as a burgeoning riff of apocalyptic
    proportions is suddenly and unexpectedly smeared across the
    audio spectrum with digital effects.</p><p>
    
    These structural inversions are a primary signifier of <i>Those
    Who Tell the Truth</i>'s sound.  Arrangements are introduced
    and then dismantled, as though they're vying with one another
    for the listener's attention.  Mogwai's <i>Young Team</i>
    is an obvious reference point; both records feature similar
    instrumentation and soft/loud dynamics. But where <i>Young
    Team</i> was content to methodically construct its walls of
    jarring white noise, <i>Those Who Tell the Truth</i> builds
    more erratically and, upon first listen, illogically. But
    with every subsequent listen, the internal organization of
    each song becomes more inviting.</p><p>
    
    Ambiguity seems to be one of the disc's greater appeals.
    Depending upon your mood, the album can document good versus
    evil, existential insignificance versus blissful ignorance,
    war versus peace, or whatever other contrasting forces best
    suit your life at the moment. Where so many lyricists fail
    in exacting the perfect sentiment, Explosions in the Sky have
    crafted a record comprised solely of ever-changing blanks to
    be filled in.  And though each of these tracks supposedly
    tells stories, one needs only draw upon their own life to
    understand the pathos explored. May these songs become a
    soundtrack to your vanity.</p></div>"|2878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2878-those-who-tell-the-truth-shall-die-those-who-tell-the-truth-shall-live-forever/|8.9|Kevin Adickes

    vinyl roughly a year ago. At that time, I thought it was the
    pre-release teaser for <i>Hoshi No Koe</i>, featuring the
    catchy single ""Sign,"" along with an a capella version (not
    available on the CD release), another new track, and a
    lengthy collaboration with some post-rock guys from Chicago.
    But the CD release of the EP got pushed back, presumably so
    that the bonus CD-ROM, an animated video of ""Sign"" by cover
    artist Katsura Moshino, could be completed. To make the CD
    more enticing, Thrill Jockey has also added ""Meteor,"" a
    single taken from the now deleted 12"" that was Takemura's
    Thrill Jockey debut (still worth hunting down for the
    stunning b-side ""Wax and Wane"").</p><p>
    Those who knew Takemura only through his deadly serious (and
    often brilliant) <i>Scope</i> album were probably shocked by
    the inclusion of the playful, cotton candy-flavored ""Sign""
    on <i>Hoshi No Koe</i>. Here was a single heavily indebted to
    the World of Nintendo, with a fragile robot singing lead on
    an actual tune, complete with verses, a chorus, and even a
    bridge. The deliberately clumsy electrobeat rhythms are
    augmented by tinny Casio chords and a riff from-- you guessed
    it-- a skipping CD. This final touch has probably reached its
    sell-by date at this point, but it does at least sound new in
    this context, that of sunny twee-pop. I like it quite a bit.</p><p>
    Those only familiar with <i>Scope</i> may have been shocked
    by ""Sign,"" but ""Meteor"" is the piece that first showcased
    this side of Takemura's personality. Though it serves as the
    prequel to ""Sign,"" ""Meteor"" is in some respects the greater
    achievement, and ranks among the finest tracks in the
    Takemura oeuvre. It starts with a cloud of clicks and slides
    before bringing in the trademark off-kilter beats around the
    one-minute mark. Bit by bit, other elements are introduced--
    some blocky electronic percussion, organ chords that can't
    quite hold it together, a random assortment of beeps and
    honks, and eventually, a disjointed ska rhythm. As the
    individual pieces fall in, they never quite seem to mesh,
    instead seeming to hover and vibrate in place, remaining
    interesting, but separate and unrelated. And then, about
    three minutes into ""Meteor,"" everything starts to gel as the
    piece increases in volume, and it finally comes together in
    a brilliant crescendo. ""Meteor"" is like a musical jigsaw
    puzzle, and when the pieces finally slide into place, it's
    exhilarating and supremely satisfying.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, ""Meteor"" keeps going for 5\xBD minutes after that
    mighty peak, spreading the considerable charms of the track a
    bit thin. For all his talents, Takemura is not the greatest
    editor, a trait also demonstrated here on the 35-minute
    collaboration with Casey Rice, Bundy K. Brown, Doug McCombs
    and John McEntire called ""Souvenir in Chicago."" I like
    sections of this piece. The first third has an impressionistic
    quality that I feel is missing from the recent Tortoise I've
    heard, seeming to drift by on a cloud of guitar feedback,
    terse bass melodies, and Takemura's rich synth chords and
    processing. About halfway in, the other players drop out and
    Takemura indulges his penchant for dense abstraction. Again,
    sections here are interesting enough, but it's difficult to
    tell what relationship, if any, these shapeless sounds have
    to the opening section of the piece. Eventually, his
    processing seems to reference bits of sound generated by the
    other players and the interest level again rises, but overall,
    this track is just too long and impenetrable.</p><p>
    ""Cogwheel"" is another interesting builder in the vein of
    <i>Hoshi No Koe</i>'s ""Anemometer,"" but the lighter tone
    allows it to blend easily with the other singles (at nine
    minutes, it's still too long, though). The bonus video is
    nice, pretty much capturing exactly what you'd expect the
    world of ""Sign"" to look like, with the flatness of the early
    Nintendo landscape and a story out of a video game, but with
    brilliantly rendered characters. But I don't really understand
    these bonus CD-ROM things-- I guess some people sit in front
    of their computers and watch them or something. Overall,
    ""Sign"" is another interesting release for devoted Takemura
    fans, but not a good introduction for the curious. Still,
    it'll do while I pine for the next full-length.</p></div>"|7919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7919-sign-ep/|7.5|Mark Richard-San

    intimates in Randii's face, which Tanya proceeds to sniff--
    thus foreshadowing the hot girl-on-girl action to come. By
    now, Mitch is supervising the panty fight. He interrupts with
    something about how sensual washers are: the wetness, the
    churning, the suds. ""Randii gets off on bubbles,"" Tanya
    volunteers. ""So do you, slut!"" Randii retorts, before
    implausibly asking Mitch how he got into this line of work.
    Apparently he's always been good with his hands. Well, Tanya
    wonders aloud, are you handy with that tool of yours there?
    By which she is almost certainly referring to Mitch's
    freakishly large trouser snake and not, I presume, the
    outsized wrench he has been holding awkwardly this whole
    time. At this point, Mushroom's <i>Foxy Music</i> begins on
    cue; such is the infallible logic of porn.</p><p>
    Space-rock has almost always been something of a jack-off: a
    remote, phallocentric, cerebral trafficking in fantasy,
    produced and consumed largely by the usual host of Moog
    aficionados, fluent Klingon speakers and hobbits. But
    Mushroom's thrilling 1999 space-psych-jazz-rock fusion
    opus, <i>Analog Hi-Fi Surprise</i> managed to bring some
    much-needed levity and play to the genre. Mushroom tossed
    the analog weirdness of Füxa, and the jagged experimentalism
    of Can into a dark, smoking concoction alongside acid-fried
    Funkadelic, <i>Jack Johnson</i>-style Miles Davis and even
    some groove-addled Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood. The result was
    some of the most instantly accessible outrock around,
    exploratory, up and infectious.</p><p>
    Following up the muddy and somewhat ill-conceived remix
    album, <i>Compared to What</i> (which featured <i>Foxy Music</i>
    snippets doctored by the likes of post-rock luminary Bundy K.
    Brown and Faust's Hans Joachim Irmler), Mushroom have
    transcended the interplanetary party music of <i>Analog
    Hi-Fi Surprise</i> and produced something downright luscious.
    The aptly titled <i>Foxy Music</i> melds pornographic funk,
    searing kraut, lounge-lizard exotica and swirling fusion
    into something hotter than the go-go girl who graces the
    album cover.</p><p>
    The shimmering Hammond B-3 that opens ""Grooving with Herbie""
    returns us to the porno script treatment where we began.
    Flute and cornet blow acid-jazz loops over Patrick O'Hearn's
    incredibly tight drumming while the organ rumbles underfoot.
    ""Grooving with Herbie"" is a clean and crisp foray into funky
    exotica, conjuring images of lotions and lava lamps, silk
    robes, gel lighting and sex bereft of awkwardness.</p><p>
    ""The Greatest Pleasure in Life Is Doing What People Say You
    Can Not Do"" is a smoldering mix of garage-psychedelia and
    dark, smoky jazz. The walking bassline and squawking trombone
    mingle with Michael Bluestein's intensely bluesy organ.
    Guitars tweak and wail in the margins. The drumming begins
    to stutter and loop backwards as ""I Got Blisters on My
    Fingers"" erupts into bright, distorted guitars reminiscent
    of the recently departed Michael Karoli's squiggly fusion
    guitar work on Can's <i>Ege Bamyasi</i>. Michael Holt's
    Rhodes keyboards are simultaneously rootsy and otherworldly.
    The explosive ""I Got Blisters"" marries psychedelic blues and
    experimental kraut masterfully, on top of which Erik Pearson
    manages to make the flute sound ferocious. It's rich and
    trippy party music for ass and head.</p><p>
    Jon Birdsong's tuba is the standout in the strutting ""Joe
    Namath."" The fuzzy and dubby ""Namath"" creates a preening,
    cocky swagger with the unlikely elements of sitar, whining
    feedback, marching band horns, and delirious guitar shred.
    The carnivalesque and tweaky title track has so little
    subtlety it might as well ask you your sign. <i>Foxy Music</i>
    is noisy, hot and dirty, with Allison Faith Levy's breathy,
    indecipherable vocals packed into a crowd of screeching
    violin, electronics, Oberheim processed guitars and furious
    percussion. The whole thing writhes on the floor like group
    sex: sleazy, beautiful and breathtaking. You're never quite
    sure what plugs into what.</p><p>
    Mushroom's instinctual experimentalism remains intact
    throughout <i>Foxy Music</i> despite the bright, insatiable
    thrust of the album. ""Getting in Thun"" is a strange soupy
    throb of subsonic bass drone and eerily clanging church bells.
    ""Don't Blame Me, I Voted for McGovern"" lays a dark,
    paramilitary stomp beneath warped organs, recalling the
    unbreakable fusion of prog and fascism that seemed to infest
    Roger Waters' brain throughout the late 70s. But ""Don't Blame
    Me,"" thankfully, serves only as a chilling (albeit muddled)
    interlude in an otherwise recklessly optimistic album.</p><p>
    All the album titles on <i>Foxy Music</i> seem plucked
    straight out of the pop cultural lexicon of the late 60s and
    early 70s, a time that's already been more carelessly
    romanticized than any other in modern American history. Yet
    everyone but the staunchest conservatives are willing to
    forgive artists for conjuring a mythic time when love was
    free and sex might just have been revolutionary. So who cares
    if Mushroom want to indulge in a little escapism? Sex in all
    its beauty, awkwardness, messiness and danger is a better
    subject than gnomes and nebulae. Mushroom (along with the
    inimitable Rollerball) are at the vanguard of movement to
    make experimentalism sexy again. Not a moment too soon, as
    far as I'm concerned.</p><p>
    And for those of you waiting for some closure on my script
    treatment, all I can say is this: a burly cop named Hogan
    shows up soon after the initial threesome. He wants to know
    what all the ruckus is about.</p></div>"|5521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5521-foxy-music/|8.2|Brent S. Sirota

It has a special place
    in my heart, being the teething ring of my distant-past
    musical awakening.  Before I was converted, my taste was
    pretty, well... let's just say ""tepid.""  I went from Billy
    Joel to Dead Kennedys in the space of a summer.  You want to
    talk about an exhilarating change in worldview?  Try digesting
    ""Chemical Warfare"" after thinking that the hardest-sounding
    thing in music was the Stones' ""Midnight Rambler.""  Luckily,
    I was shown the light before any permanent damage was done.
    (Thank you, Doug Ruby, wherever you are).</p><p>
    
    Prolific, underground vets Scared of Chaka (<i>Land of the
    Lost</i>, not Ms. Khan) are like a big, punk rock sloppy joe.
    The trio plays a mix of greasy, gearhead garage-rock spiked
    with generous doses of So-Cal punk (both old and new schools)
    and gritty Detroit proto-rock.  At their best, Scared of Chaka
    can even favorably evoke sentimental favorites like the Dead
    Kennedys (""Permission to Die"") and the Dead Milkmen (""C'Mon,
    Look Out"").  At their worst, they play some very familiar
    (and consequently, contemptuous) three-chords-and-a-bullet
    style of fast, hard rock.  You've heard it all before, though
    some of it may be worth hearing again.</p><p>
    
    Marvelously, the 14 tracks fit into 26 minutes.  Whip out your
    slide rules: at an average of 1:53 per, the songs barely have
    enough time to elicit either a satisfied smile or a grimace
    of disgust.  But they occasionally do have the punch to work,
    despite their time constraints.  The anthemic ""I'm Atomic,
    Baby"" opens the disc aggressively, with short bursts of raw
    guitar accentuating blurted, distorted vocals.  Three chords,
    three choruses and out the door.  The tempo barely dips on
    the follow-up jab, ""Why Are You Weird?"" with its hyperactive
    offbeats and a killer melodic bridge.</p><p>
    
    But after a strong, fast start, <i>Crossing with Switchblades</i>
    slogs through a relatively tame and boring midsection.  On
    much of the album, the guys get by on fury and attitude as
    much as on song quality.  Unfortunately, there's no such
    thing as slow, measured fury.  Nor does fury have a pop
    sensibility.  Heaping on the irony, you even get one track
    with a sound very derivative of a band who are themselves
    derivative: Weezer.  At least, I think it's irony...</p><p>
    
    For all its faults and unevenness, <i>Crossing with Switchblades</i>
    succeeds on a certain straightforward, no-bullshit level-- a
    level refreshingly free of any pretense or sophistication.
    In that sense, this album does nothing more or less than
    remind me of my earliest musical passion.  I do still love
    the punk rock, and Scared of Chaka tries to play it like it
    was meant to be played: with string-shredding speed, a tinny
    treble gouache and demonic howling in lieu of singing.  And
    all delivered with a sincere ""fuck you"" attitude that's
    contagious enough to make you want to kick someone in the
    head.  Which is exactly what I went and did. (Sorry, honey.)</p></div>"|7014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7014-crossing-with-switchblades/|6.0|John Dark

This morning I dreamt of a world where
    everyone suffers from socially inhibiting phobias. I walked through a world where
    laughter was rare and where all bright colors had been snuffed out. How would the
    entertainment industry eke out a dollar when everyone's perpetually bummed?  Here's
    a snippet of my vision:</p><p>
    The lovelorn electro-pop trio Figurine will be a prominent sidebar to the cover
    story of the forthcoming seasonally affected disorder and related phobias issue
    of <i>Tiger Beat</i>. It's going to be a superb issue. The magazine will also
    give heart-wrenching accounts of Christina Aguilera's battle with trichotillomania
    and Joey Fatone's emergence from years of agoraphobic-induced knuckle-cracking.</p><p>
<i>Pitchfork</i> has been granted permission to exclusively reveal details of the
    Figurine sidebar. The three members of the band first discuss their reluctant
    fondness for the color yellow and their desire to paint a lushly red broken
    heart on every street corner, in order to promote what they tragically call ""the
    love."" James and Meredith Figurine are so afflicted by ""the love"" that they sing
    about it all the time-- and sometimes with something approaching conviction.
    Third wheel David has also experienced ""the love,"" but we're never really sure
    if David is cool with James' and Meredith's unceasing canoodling. This part of
    the article shows a photo of Meredith's locker in high school. Most of the inside
    of the door is covered in faded photos of her and James out at the beach, at the
    millpond, or slurping a shared food court smoothie. But if you look closely,
    beneath the photos, you can see partially ripped-off sticky labels that read,
    ""Merry has the love for Dave.""</p><p>
    But the three are still friends. If David is still mad at his bandmates for
    hooking up and leaving him as permanent gooseberry, <i>The Heartfelt</i> doesn't
    show it. Unless that's David inserting raucous Belgium rave hoover sounds into
    the la-la-la's that James and Meredith exchange as billets-doux throughout the
    album. Maybe that's David, too, shredding the cooing couple's whispers with
    old-skool junglist breaks.</p><p>
    When James and Meredith aren't being attacked by mutant rave elements, they lay
    out their faded quilt of 80s synth pop. No one will be surprised that Figurine
    have sewn the rinky-dinkness of Depeche Mode's <i>Speak and Spell</i> to the
    pompous austerity of OMD's <i>Architecture and Morality</i>, with threads of
    heavily blushed, <i>Dare</i>-era Human League.  What's surprising is that the
    band's lyrics are-- with the charitable exception of the opening song,
    ""International Space Station II""-- woefully banal expositions on relationships
    not going perfectly. Rather than examining the root causes as to why these
    fictional relationships have collapsed into disappointment and recrimination,
    the band scrabbles for $4.99 paperback self-help platitudes and irritatingly
    weak singing.</p><p>
    The album opener, ""International Space Station II,"" looks to \xB5-Ziq for its
    otherworldly ambience and to kindergarten for its percussion as James and
    Meredith discuss their long distance relationship across the solar system.
    ""Impossible"" tosses the innovations of the opener away with its fusion of the
    Euro dance-pop of La Bouche with Visage's synth pads. (And if you were wondering,
    the Belgian rave sound being dropped into this track is annoying, rather than
    disquieting.) For ""Rewind,"" Figurine try to emulate Four Tet's <i>Pause</i>.
    Above picked acoustic guitars and Roland TB-303 squelches and stabs, James sings,
    ""Every single move you make/ Ends up being a big mistake/ You constantly embarrass
    me/ In front of friends and family."" Despite these shortcomings, James thinks
    that, with a judicious rewind, things could be made right.</p><p>
    Yaz and Depeche Mode founder Vince Clarke should have been given a writing credit
    for ""Our Game,"" which borrows liberally from Clarke's pioneering, two-finger
    keyboard style. Unfortunately, Meredith doesn't attempt to emulate Alison Moyet's
    bluesy power.  Instead, as on the rest of <i>The Heartfelt</i>, her voice is
    paltry and characterless.  Figurine redeem the track halfway through, however.
    Like the old Studio 1 releases that segued from the vocal to the dub version, so
    does ""Our Game"" launch into its remix version with glistening glee.</p><p>
    Without lacing <i>The Heartfelt</i> with the anxiety of Fad Gadgett, Lali Puna's
    pop contortions, or the retro futurist panache of Ladytron, Figurine slump into
    being just another band who are competent at recreating music to wear too much
    make-up to.  And that, my friends, is frustrating, because I <i>know</i> members
    of this band are capable of outstanding work.  The core of Figurine is Dntel's
    James Tamborello, whose <i>Life is Full of Possibilities</i> LP is the most
    creative and provocative statement I've heard this year.  But where <i>Life is
    Full of Possibilities</i> takes risks and subverts, <i>The Heartfelt</i> is simple
    and unremarkably dour.  If this is how Figurine define ""heartfelt,"" they'll learn
    much from <i>Seventeen</i>'s forthcoming article on defeating low self-esteem and
    underachievement.</p></div>"|3054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3054-the-heartfelt/|6.0|Paul Cooper

    My eyes convulsed in time with the massive flashes of white, but I didn't really
    mind. Somehow, Franky and I had made it to that sacred place where the lights
    are far too bright and the sound is far too loud. The excitement was palpable.
    Though the vast majority of the 10,000 or so people present was directly behind
    me, and well outside of my field of view, I could sense the size and excitement
    of the crowd around me.  I turned to Franky, who stared in rapt attention at the
    stage, absolutely silent.</p><p>
    
    Finally, the moment arrived. These five beings graced the stage like the gods of
    old descending from Olympus, illuminated by the fiery rays of Helios' chariot.
    The scene was as heavenly and beautiful as Jesus and Buddha playing handball on
    Jerry Garcia's assflab. The crowd's response was as loud and forceful as a tidal
    wave of live kittens.  Yet, Franky remained silent. Finally, as the band prepared
    for their first song, he turned his head to me, his brown eyes shiny and round
    like a sheep turd soaked in glitter. Surely, he was aware that this was the
    single most magical moment of his life ever. Staring awestruck at the massive
    crowd behind my head, Franky opened his mouth slightly, prepared to speak. And
    the words he spoke, which seemed to flow straight from his soul like a leaky
    thermos of godly ambrosia, have remained with me to this day:</p><p>
    
    ""Thom Yorke just got 10,000 people to pay $60 to stare at his ugly ass.""</p><p>
    
    Sure enough, the audience seemed to be positively transfixed by the image of
    Yorke, his lazy eye dragging two or three centimeters behind him, twitching and
    wailing. It wouldn't be much of a stretch to equate the show to Radiohead's
    music itself-- big rock laced with intrigue, fragility, and ugliness. On <i>I
    Might Be Wrong</i>, a good deal of the essence of Radiohead's live show is
    distilled onto an eight-track EP. And while some moments are absolutely stellar,
    <i>I Might Be Wrong</i> is only a shadow of what a Radiohead live album could
    have been.</p><p>
    
    Like most Radiohead shows, <i>I Might Be Wrong</i> opens with ""The National
    Anthem."" The song's introduction, with Thom Yorke breathing in staccato over
    Colin Greenwood's thunderous bassline and Jonny Greenwood's skillful manipulation
    of the primitive Ondes-Martenot, is absolutely wonderful. Without a horn section,
    though, the song never really develops as it does on <i>Kid A</i>, trailing off
    without a satisfying conclusion.</p><p>
    
    ""The National Anthem"" is followed by ""I Might Be Wrong,"" a song that wouldn't be
    even remotely interesting in its live incarnation if not for the subtle shifts
    in dynamics that grace the middle and end of the song. ""Morning Bell,"" like ""The
    National Anthem,"" builds to a meandering ending.  But it meanders with enough
    grace to keep it interesting, with Ed O'Brien and Jonny Greenwood working their
    trademark magic with effects-laden guitars and synthesizers.</p><p>
    
    With ""Like Spinning Plates,"" <i>I Might Be Wrong</i> hits its stride. Recasting
    the song as a piano ballad with eerie synthesized strings, Radiohead turned one
    of <i>Amnesiac</i>'s most cryptically brilliant tracks into something much more
    emotional and accessible without being at all sappy or manipulative. With this
    new version, the song's melody-- complete with the eerily, vaudevillian quality
    that inhabits it during the chorus-- takes center stage, showcasing Radiohead's
    songwriting virtuosity rather than their sonic adventurousness.</p><p>
    
    ""Like Spinning Plates"" is followed by ""Idioteque"" and ""Everything in its Right
    Place,"" possibly the two finest tracks from <i>Kid A</i>, and certainly one of
    the better sections of this EP. The former succeeds in capturing the energy
    Yorke channels during live interpretations of the song, whereas the latter takes
    the aural experimentation of the album version one step further, with sublime
    digital manipulations building electronic tapestries of sound.</p><p>
    
    After the schizophrenic meltdown of ""Idioteque"" and the catharsis of ""Everything
    in Its Right Place,"" an entirely unexceptional version of ""Dollars and Cents"" is
    more than a little bit of a letdown, as it lacks both momentum and innovation.
    But ""Dollars and Cents"" is followed by <i>I Might Be Wrong</i>'s main attraction,
    the previously unreleased ""True Love Waits.""  An acoustic outtake from the <i>OK
    Computer</i> era, ""True Love Waits"" is absolutely gorgeous. With signature
    unexpected chord changes and a melody that both aches and soothes, ""True Love
    Waits"" can hold its own against any song on <i>OK Computer</i>, and makes a very
    welcome ending to <i>I Might Be Wrong</i>.</p><p>
    
    But while tracks like ""Like Spinning Plates"" and ""True Love Waits"" certainly
    justify the existence of <i>I Might Be Wrong</i>, the EP seems purposely limited
    in a way that's immensely frustrating. At only eight songs, the disc is being
    sold and marketed (and priced) as a full-length album. Given the fact that so
    many shows were recorded in preparation for this EP, there's absolutely no
    reason that <i>I Might Be Wrong</i> should have been limited to eight tracks.
    Similarly frustrating is the fact that every single track here, aside from ""True
    Love Waits,"" is taken from either <i>Kid A</i> or <i>Amnesiac</i>. The inclusion
    of a live version of ""Fake Plastic Trees,"" ""Karma Police,"" or ""Just"" would have
    rounded off the record nicely. Sadly, one can't shake the feeling that this disc
    exists largely as a promotional item for Radiohead's last two albums.</p><p>
    
    The quality of the recordings and performances on <i>I Might Be Wrong</i> is
    certainly top-notch. But Internet bootlegs-- most notably a soundboard recording
    from Nijmegen, a small city in Holland-- present a better, more complete picture of the Radiohead
    live experience. Still, even with better live documents available for free, it's
    hard to resist an officially sanctioned live EP with a few absolutely stellar
    tracks. And although <i>I Might Be Wrong</i> is obnoxiously incomplete, the fact
    remains that Thom Yorke just got 100,000 people to spend $17.99 for eight songs.
    Good for him.</p></div>"|6657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6657-i-might-be-wrong-live-recordings-ep/|8.0|Matt LeMay

    like your cup of tea then skip this review entirely.  You heard me, I said
    ""scram,"" and take your image-obsessed indie t-shirt with you!  Nobody wants you
    here!  Come on, take off.</p><p>
    
    Are they gone?  Okay, I think they're gone.  Now, as I said, Kroko play prog.
    This isn't flowery symphonic stuff, metal or something that sounds like Alan
    Parsons.  It's more in the school of Zappa, Henry Cow and the Rock in Opposition
    (RIO) crew, wherein abstraction, noise and improvisation get mixed in with the
    expected heavy chops and extended instrumental workouts.  The band is a trio
    (guitar, bass and drums), but as you may or may not expect, they make a
    considerably greater racket than three guys are normally expected to produce.</p><p>
    
    Now, I don't have to tell you that this kind of thing doesn't stand a good chance
    of catching on with your average rock listener.  If you're reading this, it's
    obvious that you couldn't give two shakes about whether music was trendy or cool
    or ""fairly normal"" or ""acceptable to regular people"" or ""the kind of thing you
    could put on and not have people running for cover or giving you condescending
    stares like you're some kind of super nerd who never gets out and when he does
    it's probably to buy advance copies of the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> souvenir
    program.""  That goes without saying.  And it's the average, non-discerning rock
    listener's loss to miss out on an album like <i>Furia</i>, because while it's
    not exactly going to change the world, it's definitely good for kicking out a
    few jams.</p><p>
    
    Kroko, comprised of Pentti Dassum (guitar), Petri Hissa (drums) and Jyrki
    Ylikiski (bass) do know a thing or two about tearing it up live.  In fact,
    their website speaks of influences varying from ""jam to jam,"" and the music
    here supports the theory that they've cut more than a few teeth onstage.  Many
    of the tunes veer off into exploratory, guitar-led excursions that remind me
    of King Crimson's similar mid-70s concert journeys.  Dassum favors heavy
    distortion, a la Nels Cline or an agitated, Mahavishnu-era John McLaughlin,
    and Hissa is nothing if not on fire, consistently at the heels of the other two
    to get a groove on and keep moving.  Again, this is the kind of role Bill Bruford
    played during those classic Crimson shows from the 70s, though Hissa is quite a
    step more extroverted on the skins, suggesting a combination of folks like fusion
    master Narada Michael Walden and Ruins' boss Tatsuya Yoshida.</p><p>
    
    The album begins with someone snoring, but the alarm sounds soon enough with
    ""Ambient Ballad Pt. 1.""  I guess the Fins are feeling the irony, as this tune
    is basically straight-ahead avant super-rock.  Crazy overdriven guitar feeds
    right into the off-kilter, faux-anthemic riff of the opening (reminding me
    of another quirky prog act, Samla Mammas Manna-- also Scandinavian, and also
    knowers of the jam).  Kroko don't really kick it into something you could
    headbang to until the next short tune, ""Polanski After Ski.""  It's fast, it's in
    11/8, it's got tons of cool drum fills and a nifty bass riff-- yes, three songs
    in, and they're still prog.  How's that for attention span?</p><p>
    
    Kroko aren't always high energy, as tunes like ""Sol Ist"" and ""Setzer Au Naturelle""
    feature some rather lovely, restrained guitar work reminiscent of Bill Frisell's
    noir-esque colorings on the non-schitzo Naked City tunes.  There are even hints
    of after-hours jazz, but only for a bit, and then the band returns to their
    hallowed rev-up/burn-out territory.  There are even a few live tracks scattered
    throughout that give them ample time to ""explore"" their bad selves to everyone's
    content.</p><p>
    
    Of course, if you're so inclined, there's a whole canon of albums in this style,
    although most of them are from the 70s, and usually aren't afforded the same
    reverie as other, more socially (and critically) ""acceptable"" stuff like
    krautrock or jazz fusion.  Besides Crimson (and the aforementioned Samla, Zappa
    and the Mahavishnu Orchestra), Kroko belong to a lineage that includes Henry Cow
    and Italy's Area, as well as more recent bands like Anekdoten, Hoyry Kone (also
    from Finland) and Miriodor.  And while I'd love to write up the histories of all
    of these acts, I'd really rather you take this album as a starter and move on
    from there, investigating the secret world of avant-prog to your heart's content.
    All you really need is the desire to jam, and maybe a slight fetish for grooves
    in 11.</p></div>"|4540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4540-furia/|7.7|Dominique Leone

    a lot about them. As San Diego's leading purveyors of spasmodic Roland-and-cocaine-fueled
    metal-core (or something like that), much ink has been spilled (and bandwidth
    eaten up by chat-rooms) for their praise or dismissal. They may be the height
    of pretension, or they might be saviors of punk (or both), but at this point,
    only one thing is certain to me, and that's that everyone has a strong opinion
    one way or another about the Locust, which is in itself a victory on their part.</p><p>
    
    What's interesting about all the discussion that's taken place is how little of
    it pertains to the actual music the band plays.  Most of revolves around the
    band's fashion sense, their snotty pretentiousness, the violence often inspired
    at their live performances, or the high prices commanded by official Locust belt
    buckles on eBay-- anything but the music. And there's a very good reason for this:
    it's difficult to say anything much about their music.</p><p>
    
    Not that the Locust is all style and no substance-- it's just that their
    45-second-long blasts of raw plasma need no explaining. They're self-contained,
    self-fulfilling, and self-justifying. Some would add masturbatory to the list,
    but it's still interesting that, as I write this, somebody somewhere is writing
    a hefty manifesto detailing how all of human cultural history leads up to and
    finds its culmination in the Locust, when nothing is going to settle the matter
    better than just dropping the needle on one of their records.</p><p>
    
    But if this is the case, then why this polarity?  It's surely not just the music,
    because strictly speaking, the Locust aren't doing anything incredibly novel. I
    mean, as I listen to this EP, <i>Flight of the Wounded Locust</i>, I can see a
    dozen records on my shelf that sound strikingly similar. Even their shtick, if
    you want to call it that, isn't all that unique.  So what is it that causes the
    pro- and con- Locust camps to argue their cases so vehemently?</p><p>
    
    I'm guessing it has something to do with the stakes involved. Punk is at a
    critical juncture (possibly more so than ever before) because there's no clear
    standard bearer. So along comes the Locust, a bunch of kids who used to be in
    some very influential hardcore bands like Swing Kids and Struggle. They're cocky
    and cool and cause a stir. People start talking, and they sell a ton of records
    (by indie standards, anyway). Soon, major labels are interested and the band is
    half a step away from making videos, despite playing completely inaccessible,
    obnoxious noise that 99% of the population wouldn't even categorize as music.
    So with something as ""important"" as the future of punk on the line, everybody
    interested feels like they've got to get their word in and try to steer critical
    assessment.</p><p>
    
    As for the music on this 11-track, 10-minute EP, what's there to say?  Frontman
    Justin Pearson screams about rotting animals (not that you'd know it unless you read
    the lyric sheet). Swirling keyboards play themes for evil circus clowns.  The
    bassist and guitarist try to kill each other with slicing riffs while the drummer
    plays like Vishnu on meth. Ultimately, it explains itself better than anything I
    could say. But if you want my advice, buy it, put it on.  It won't take you long
    to form an opinion. And if you don't like it, you'll have no problem selling it
    back at full-prince on eBay. Especially if put it in a pastry bag and pass it off
    as a limited edition promotional item.</p></div>"|4824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4824-flight-of-the-wounded-locust-ep/|7.8|Jason Nickey

Last year, while interning at Social Services
    somewhere in rural, truly ass-backwards Virginia, I ran across the case of a
    client-- we'll call him the Deer Hunter-- who I thought needed a good one
    (excuse, that is).  As they say, ""Virginia is for Lovers.""  In this case, the
    Deer Hunter was in love with two things: hunting and humping. Police learned
    that the hard way, discovering him outdoors in <i>flagrante delicto</i> with
    Bambi.  I'm not talking a hooker, either.  I'm talking a deer.  A fresh kill,
    as it were.  And a fresh ""conquest,"" I might add.</p><p>
    
    Considering Virginia's Criminal Code, which outlaws sodomy, cohabitation, and
    all sex acts between unmarried persons, one would think that the Old Dominion
    would have made room for necrobestiality.  But one would think wrong.  The Deer
    Hunter needed no excuse for his carnal passions-- deer-scrumping is punishable
    in a court of law only if the animal is still living. Dead animals are fair
    game. Somewhere in Virginia, shotguns are being loaded.</p><p>
    
    Minus the Bear, a quintet from the northwest comprised of members of Botch, Kill
    Sadie and Sharks Keep Moving, have more in common with the Deer Hunter than they
    might like to think.  For one thing, just as the Deer Hunter needed no excuse to
    ride, Minus the Bear needs absolutely no excuse to rock.  But who ever did?  It
    is no crime to rock.  So, without shame, Minus the Bear charges forth, imbuing
    their debut seven-track EP, <i>This Is What I Know About Being Gigantic</i>, with
    fervent rock energy.</p><p>
    
    This is not, however, your ordinary missionary-style rock and roll.  Consider
    again the Deer Hunter; one can hardly blame the guy-- his kids were probably
    growing older, losing their sex appeal with each passing day. So, instead of
    letting life control him, he grabbed it by the antlers.  Call it perverted, call
    it resourceful, call it what you will.  But one thing is certain: the man was
    creative.  Like Jed, Minus the Bear are innovators.  No strumming or chunking
    here; axe-man David Knudson drives the band with fluid, catchy, tapped riffs.
    The bright, focused guitar tone is a trademark of Minus the Bear's sound. Another
    twist is the band's electronic elements: noises whisper, hover, and gurgle in
    the background, adding depth and richness to the mix.</p><p>
    
    The drums are propulsive and complementary, jumping with the same energy as the
    guitars. Erin Tate is an active drummer, frequently adding firm tom and snare
    fills. Bassist Cory Murchy, who with Tate make up Kill Sadie's rhythm section,
    has a great time and a great ear; his basslines lock solidly with the other
    rhythm elements, while providing tasteful harmony. Vocals, courtesy of Jake
    Snider, are infrequent but appropriate; they act more like a fifth musical
    element than a song's centerpiece.</p><p>
    
    Minus the Bear's song structures are equally as creative, going the prog/math-rock
    route in pursuit of unexpected bridges, rhythmic dynamics and time signatures.
    The opening track, amusingly titled, ""Hey, Wanna Throw Up? Get Me Naked,"" is a
    great example. It lifts-off with a cleanly tapped riff, then cuts to power-rock
    for the chorus, and weaves in and out of a fuzzy, waltzing bassline and gurgling
    synth to close.  The album's finale, ""Pantsuit.Uggghhh,"" drones for two minutes
    before a jagged guitar riffs intrudes and adds tempo. Snider repeats the chorus,
    ""No one sleeps yet/ Let's keep it going til the morning,"" while Knudson merges
    into a characteristic tapping, contrasted by intermittent bass jabs. Unconventional
    but catchy as all hell.</p><p>
    
    The Deer Hunter needed no excuse. Minus the Bear needs no excuse. Add another to
    the list: you. You need absolutely no excuse to add Minus the Bear to your CD
    collection. Any group this tight and proficient on their first recording
    undoubtedly has much more to say. And at the price of an EP, <i>This Is What I
    Know</i> is about as cheap as a walk in the woods.</p></div>"|5323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5323-this-is-what-i-know-about-being-gigantic-ep/|8.6|Brad Haywood

    was chaos, a turbulent cesspool of pop culture that fed off and eroded the
    genteel traditions of Western culture.  From this confusion and formlessness
    rose the prophet Zappa, uniting the sublime and the absurd amid arching guitar
    solos, holy hosannas des latrines de Chartres.  From there, it
    pretty much boils down to so-and-so begot so-and-so, with certain offspring
    taking the high road while others took the low.  Bands like Sonic Youth and
    Pavement built their names and legacies on aspiring to the highbrow camp,
    their reputations gradually gaining momentum until the achievement of Canonical
    Indie Rock status.  And then there's the Moldy Peaches, the musical equivalent
    of the pull-my-finger gag, who prefer references to blowjobs and buttholes
    over Mark E. Smith and John Cage.</p><p>
    
    Kimya Dawson and Adam Green are the Sonny and Cher of post-millennial toilet
    humor.  But, still subscribing to the slacker ethos of mid-90s college dropouts,
    Dawson offers a bipolar, type-a confusion in lieu of Cher's wide-eyed, free-love
    naivete.  She's as likely to sit bleary-eyed in front of a ""Scooby Doo"" cartoon
    as she is to dream of clawing out the eyes of the prom queen.  And standing in
    for the awkward ""I can't believe I scored this piece of ass"" straightman, Green
    fulfills Sonny's role with a more updated ""thank god I've got this genuinely
    cool chick who'd like to claw out the eyes of the prom queen"" schtick.</p><p>
    
    The Moldy Peaches' sound is as lo-fi as imaginably possible.  The first seven
    of these 22 tracks are unpredictable, hilarious and, despite the sloppy,
    couldn't-give-a-shit delivery, the songwriting is really pretty good for a
    couple of bedroom wanna-be-Beat-Happenings with a four-track.  Of course, it's
    hard to keep this kind of thing up for long, and things eventually start to go
    down the crapper (as it were).</p><p>
    
    The rest of the album ranges from the whimsical acoustic musings of ""Jorge
    Regula"" and ""Anyone Else But You"" to the manic ""What Went Wrong"" and ""Greyhound
    Bus.""  There are touching moments, sure: the kooky heartbreak of ""Nothing Came
    Out"" (""Without forty ounces of social skills/ I'm just an ass in the crack of
    humanity/ I'm just a huge manatee"") that somehow mixes in references to G.I. Joe,
    Ron Jeremy and He-Man.  There's the irresistible, mind-in-the-gutter boogie of
    ""Downloading Porn with Dave,"" sounding like a road trip down Route 66 with Hunter
    Thompson and Linda Lovelace (""Sleepin' in a van between A &amp; B/ Suckin' dick for
    ecstasy"").  There's the tripped-out spookiness of ""These Burgers.""  But for
    every hit, there's an ass in the crack of humanity.  Witness the wack b-boy
    embarrassment of ""On Top,"" or the asinine pep-talk to blooming geeks everywhere,
    ""D.2. Boyfriend.""  It's not a pretty thing.</p><p>
    
    One thing the Moldy Peaches have going for them is their utter lack of pretense.
    It makes it difficult to criticize because, despite its terrible unevenness, what
    you hear is exactly what they intended.  Also, the fun that was obviously had
    during the recording session is infectious-- there are moments when Dawson and
    Green are trying as hard as they can not to bust a nut laughing.  And while
    childish, things like this enhance the replay value.</p><p>
    
    It remains to be seen whether the Moldy Peaches can reproduce their achievement
    here, or whether we really want them to.  But I can see the duo as the one of
    those unexplained groups that disappear as soon as they've arrived and cascade
    through the years as a cult favorite.  And for all of us who feel like we grew
    up trapped in a Todd Solondz script, we've found ourselves a couple of friends
    for our damaged inner child.</p></div>"|5382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5382-moldy-peaches/|6.5|Nathan Rooney

This is due to the fact that this disc
    and its companion (<i>Coming Up: Independent Artists Pay Tribute to the Music of
    Paul McCartney</i>) are actually designed to bring in money for breast cancer
    charities.  My brain's moral police are trying to get some sort of injunction
    forcing me to endorse the disc, but as a music fan, I can't quite bring myself
    to do it.  After all, it's not my job to be some sort of social evangelist here;
    I'm just supposed to review the album and tell you whether or not the music on
    it is any good.  On with it, then.</p><p>
    
    First, let's establish that there aren't any Beatles songs on here-- only solo
    Paul (or Wings, which I will also refer to as ""solo Paul,"" for obvious reasons).
    Opinions vary widely on just how essential Sir McCartney's
    post-greatest-band-of-all-time output is, but few can deny that there are
    definitely a few corkers floating through his discography.  He's certainly
    the most commercially successful of the former Beatles, too, and given the
    sheer volume of material available, it only seems right that he should receive
    some sort of tribute in his honor.</p><p>
    
    A few of the selections here manage to do clever things with their respective
    originals, and all of the readings at least reflect a genuine admiration for
    the source material.  However, most ultimately end up rehashing Macca's own
    performances while adding little to nothing in the process.  In order to give
    you a detailed look at just what <i>Listen to What the Man Said</i> has to offer
    you, here's a track-by-track breakdown of the whole thing:</p><p>
    
    1.Owsley: ""Band on the Run.""  Damn.  This guy used to play backup for Shania
    Twain and Amy Grant.  He opens the disc with a version of ""Band on the Run"" that,
    at a low enough volume, could easily be mistaken for the original.  This is one
    of Paul's best solo songs, and given its linear composition, it would be
    intimidating to try and rearrange it significantly, but this is just ridiculous.
    Every single note is exactly the same, and most of the instrument sounds are
    approximate to the originals.  Really, you might as well just listen McCartney's.</p><p>
    
    2.SR-71: ""My Brave Face.""  So, it's been established that punk is never really
    going to die, but couldn't pop/punk die in its place?  Please?  I'd also complain
    about bands with numbers in their names, but these guys are at least named for a
    cool spy plane.  Regardless, these guys turn in a standard pop/punk version of
    ""My Brave Face"" that you just don't need to hear.</p><p>
    
    3.Kevin Hearn, Steven Page and Stephen Duffy: ""Junk.""  So that's two guys from
    the Barenaked Ladies, and one guy from the Lilac Time.  Their version of
    McCartney's ""Junk"" is, surprisingly, one of the most satisfying songs on this
    album, pumping the minimally arranged original full of carnivalesque atmosphere
    with the addition of some accordion-like keyboards.  It's a waltz through a
    slightly cracked world of childhood memories that doesn't get old even after
    several listens.  And, of course, the original is one of Paul's greatest solo
    songs-- having good source material never hurt anyone.</p><p>
    
    4.Semisonic: ""Jet.""  Another ultra-faithful, fairly pointless cover that adds
    virtually nothing to the original.  In fact, it takes out the orchestra, and
    vocalist Dan Wilson's pipes are barely up to the task of singing the melody.  I
    had a really good joke about ""Closing Time"" to use here about an hour ago, but
    I forgot it during dinner.  At any rate, there's really no reason for this
    recording to exist when, again, you could just listen to the original, which is
    basically identical, except for the superior performance.</p><p>
    
    5.The Merrymakers: ""No More Lonely Nights."" Unless you were desperately seeking
    a band whose entire sound is indebted to Graham Nash's ""Our House"" and sitcom
    themes, there's not a whole lot of merrymaking going on here.  Truth be told,
    the band actually improves a little on the original, which is one of my least
    favorite McCartney songs.  The original is fairly cornball, and the Merrymakers
    nix the gratuitously long guitar solo sections, while instilling the song with a
    more modern loud/soft chorus/verse dynamic.  In the end, it's a pretty faithful
    cover of one of McCarntey's lesser songs with a slightly more modern feel, and
    a wholly unnecessary one at that.</p><p>
    
    6.Robyn Hitchcock: ""Let Me Roll It.""  The most baffling thing about this selection
    is the fact that it's not credited to the Soft Boys, as it should be.  Hitchcock
    is joined by Windsor, Rew, and Seligman on a cover of possibly the most
    Lennon-esque song McCartney ever wrote (""Helter Skelter"" notwithstanding).  They
    do a fine job of it as well, but it suffers from the same affliction that a lot
    of the other tracks here do: not enough imagination.  It's basically a faithful
    run-through, and I frankly expected a little more from the man who gave us ""I
    Want to Be an Anglepoise Lamp"" and ""Sandra's Having Her Brain Out.""  Still, it's
    an entertaining listen, and there are subtle psychedelic flourishes that make it
    worthwhile.</p><p>
    
    7.The Finn Brothers: ""Too Many People.""  Late of Split Enz and Crowded House, the
    Finn Brothers offer an upbeat, tight version of ""Too Many People,"" which wasn't
    really terribly good in its original form.  This version manages to capture Paul's
    excellent bassline perfectly, but Denny Laine's fine guitar part loses some of
    its impact on the cover.  Once again, it would have been nice if the duo hadn't
    been afraid to bring something uniquely their own to the song.</p><p>
    
    8.The Minus 5: ""Dear Friend."" Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey get props for
    choosing an obscurity from <i>Wild Life</i>, one of McCartney's rawest, oddest
    solo albums.  They do a great job with it, too, capturing the original's wrecked,
    sad ambiance with aplomb.  Harpsichords march solemnly in the background while
    e-bowed guitars sing in sympathy with the song's protagonist, whom McCaughey
    ably plays.  Paul's quiet response to John's ""How Do You Sleep?"" hasn't sounded
    this good since he recorded it himself back in 1971.</p><p>
    
    9.Matthew Sweet: ""Every Night""  Um, once again, points off for lack of imagination.
    Sweet keeps it simple and his version works well enough, but it feels a lot like
    a runthrough that didn't require a lot of thought.  That said, it's quite
    affecting when Sweet's gruff voice takes on the wordless vocals at the end of
    the song.</p><p>
    
    10.Sloan: ""Waterfalls.""  Contrary to popular belief, the Beatles of the Great
    White North is not Klaatu, it's Sloan.  So who better to cover a Paul McCartney
    tune than four guys who've made their career writing songs that play heir to his
    legacy?  Well, no one does it better on this disc.  Halifax's finest offer a
    significantly energized take on McCartney's elegiac original, and it works
    beautifully.  Silk-throated singer Jay Ferguson himself writes in the liner
    notes that he felt the best way to go about doing a McCartney cover was to pick
    a song that you could make your own, rather than simply copying the original.
    If only the rest of the bands on this compilation had used as much imagination.</p><p>
    
    11.World Party: ""Man We Was Lonely.""  I've always thought that if the Beatles
    had stayed together through 1970, ""Man We Was Lonely"" would have been the
    obligatory Ringo vocal on the follow-up to <i>Let It Be</i>, with its bounding
    feel and sing-song chorus.  World Party's Karl Wallinger plays it straight
    here, which means it's enjoyable to listen to, but also, once again, nearly
    identical to the original.</p><p>
    
    12.John Faye Power Trip: ""Coming Up.""  The John Faye Power Trip, aside from
    having an excellent bandname, manage to pay tribute here not only to Sir Paul,
    but also the late George Harrison, nicking the bassline from ""Taxman"" and
    inserting it slightly altered into a nicely reworked version of one of McCartney's
    few attempts at getting funky.  The result is one of the most enjoyable and
    unique tracks on the disc, and one of the few songs that feels more like homage
    than imitation.</p><p>
    
    13.Virgos: ""Maybe I'm Amazed."" Pretty much all that's different about this
    version of ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" is that the piano part of the original has been
    replaced by a guitar playing the same thing.  It's basically ""Maybe I'm
    Amazed"" filtered through the lens of radio-ready modern rock with a slight
    glam edge added.  Vocalist Brett Hesla does an admirable job of hitting the
    high notes, but there's not nearly enough to distinguish this version from
    McCartney's version.</p><p>
    
    14.Judybats: ""Love in Song.""  A footnote of early-90s alternative rock, the
    Judybats come out from the rock they've been hiding under since people stopped
    caring to offer a psychedelic version of <i>Venus &amp; Mars</i>' ""Love in Song.""
    Paul's version stands as one of his creepiest, loneliest songs, and the Judybats
    trade in that atmosphere for modern crunch and a more aggressive approach.  It's
    not better than the original by any means, but it's one of the most thoughtful
    reimaginings present, and it deserves points just for that.</p><p>
    
    15.Linus of Hollywood: ""Warm and Beautiful.""  McCartney as easy-listening vocal
    jazz.  Linus performs a capella, layering his voice in the background to provide
    rhythms.  I don't deny the man's vocal skill or passion, but this blows harder
    than a level three hurricane.  Shut up, Linus.</p><p>
    
    16.They Might Be Giants: ""Ram On.""  With the possible exception of our friend
    Linus, this is the most bizarre offering on the disc.  The Johns choose to ditch
    the vocals entirely, instead coming up with a hodgepodge instrumental tribute.
    It actually touches nicely on the spirit of the original, which was fairly
    strange and dubby to begin with.  It closes the disc on a whimsical note that's
    lacking from a large portion of what comes before it, too, so it feels
    exceptionally well-placed.</p><p>
    
    And there you have it.  The main problem with this disc is that most of the
    artists simply don't do enough with the songs they're using to make it
    interesting.  The enthusiasm of each artist is evident from the liner notes,
    and most of it's not horrible, but it still feels less than necessary.  But
    then, there's the fact that it was all done for a charitable cause.  Of course,
    the best intentions can't mask a sub-par product, which is what this is.  Is
    <i>Listen to What the Man Said</i> worth your time?  Eh, probably not, unless

    Coleman. Drill-n-bass has lost its appeal, too, over the years. Thus, Coleman has
    abandoned his former alias and style and is all the better for the switch. As
    Animals on Wheels, Coleman gave the world two albums of breakbeat encrusted noise,
    and as such, sat on the fringes of the Ninja Tune roster. Now recording for
    Thrill Jockey, Coleman finds himself comfortable, his avant-leaning precocity
    embraced by the label that also writes royalty checks for Mouse on Mars, Nobukazu
    Takemura, and Oval.</p><p>
    
    Though trading in the frenetic energy of his Animals on Wheels' releases, Coleman
    is still pursuing juxtapositions.  Whereas Animals on Wheels' <i>Designs and
    Mistakes</i>, and its less frantic successor, <i>Nuvol I Cadira</i>, sought to
    contrast wounding shards of breakbeats with warm fuzzy melodies, <i>Everything
    Was Beautiful, and Nothing Hurt</i> looks for clashes between elegance and
    distortion.  These distortions, created with antiquated 16-bit equipment and
    soundcards, imbue Coleman's gorgeous melodies with an aliased corona that works
    in harmony with the very appropriate title that Coleman has chosen for this
    collection.</p><p>
    
    Emerging from low frequency waves, ""Too Early By Far"" pits white noise against a
    harmonium drone and a piano melody. Despite the white noise gathering supporters
    from the clapped-out percussion synth Coleman uses, the exuberant piano melody
    excels and is greeted at the end by a honking bass clarinet. ""Pi Four"" finds
    Coleman's piano trading lines with a frazzled, piercing, possibly
    guitar-in-origin figure, while a Boards of Canada-style rhythm ensures that all
    punches are above the belt. The crazy calliope of ""Escalator Apartment"" wrestles
    with a <i>Nuvol I Cadira</i>-ish breakbeat clatter.</p><p>
    
    The Bucephalus Bouncing Ball
    melody and cracked percussion of ""Plot Lost Sixteen"" take me back to agitated
    Sunday afternoons, apparently lazy, but in fact fraught with nascent nastiness.
    ""Vocational Shouter"" recalls Aphex Twin's fuzzy masterpiece, ""Tha,"" with its
    anchorless, sinewy chords grasping for just a moment's coherence. ""Hang Up
    Season"" carries on the approximation of sense begun with ""Vocational Shouter.""
    About the exerting synthline, shrill lines force their way in and out of the
    background like the angels of death from <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>.</p><p>
    
    During ""Wider Ignorance,"" Coleman subverts a routine downtempo drum pattern by
    sideswiping it with electronic piano chords and a melody borrowed from Salvador
    Dali's mother's musical jewelry box. Closing the album with the spacious-but-weighty
    ""Curse of Knowing"" Coleman proves one final time that he's as fascinating a
    pianist as he is a drum machine operator. With <i>Everything Was Beautiful and
    Nothing Hurt</i>, Andrew Coleman has accomplished the fusion of avant-garde
    electronics and poetic pianism. Coleman serenely succeeds where Richard D.
    James' <i>Drukqs</i> faltered: Coleman wasn't faking when he came up with his
    album title.</p></div>"|1543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1543-everything-was-beautiful-and-nothing-hurt/|8.8|Paul Cooper

    Nottingham, England.  There's not a trace of British accent anywhere on her debut
    album, <i>Sweet Heart Fever</i>.  I have a suspicion that she's the reincarnation
    of a Louisiana bayou blues songstress, reborn to tell her tales of love and desire.
    There's more than a hint of southern American twang in each of these fourteen
    songs, and her guitar seems as apt at spinning yarns as jangling out these folky
    tunes.</p><p>
    
    On first listen, Niblett may seem overly precocious.  ""So Much Love to Do"" bounces
    along merrily on the upstroke of her guitar.  ""It's comin' after me, 'cause I'm
    comin' after you,"" she sings, drawing out the notes in a cutesy crescendo.  But
    then she places a nice, ominous pause between ""there's so much love"" and ""to do,""
    which she sings falteringly.  This hint of hesitance carries on through most of
    her work.  ""Miss My Lion"" begins with an intense Zeppelin-esque riff, then breaks
    down into subtle strumming.  Her plaintive cry contrasts well with the whimsical
    lyrics:  ""When we get home, it'll be like a party/ See how we move, sunlit and
    playful.""  Then the song shifts to aggressive pickwork again and her voice loses
    all restraint: ""When you drive, there's no fooling me/ Those roads invited me.""</p><p>
    
    Niblett's voice can pierce the high register almost painfully, but more often,
    she remains somewhere between girlish warble and sultry waver.  The production
    work is immediate, bringing the sounds of her guitar to the forefront, and yet,
    her songs retain a certain mystique.  She's joined on some tracks by drummer
    Kristian Goddard.  The lilting groove created by her chords and his bass drum on
    ""The Dance of Sulphur"" adds to the mystery in her lyrics: ""I felt something
    guarding me, as I entered the country...""</p><p>
    
    You could call Niblett's lyricism ""mysterious,"" but at times, she plain doesn't
    make sense.  That song goes on to mention something about ""falling over constantly,""
    psychic moles (?!) and ""where the wild things rest,"" as far as I can tell.  Other
    lyrics confess that ""Neptune's in transit"" and ""trampling action causes me upsets.""
    Niblett's ability to transform her simple instrumental setup into a unique
    patchwork of emotion and imagery is impressive, but the resulting impressionist
    canvas might be annoying to some in its fussy level of self-concern.  It's like
    the nervous manifestation of fever dreams on a long, hot summer night.</p><p>
    
    Still, Niblett hits home more often than not.  On ""Wet Road,"" there's no mistaking
    the shivering tension in her voice, barely containing some unnamable desire as she
    sings, ""Wet road, paradise, wet roads today/ On the way to your house again.""
    She goes on to chide like a young Bessie Smith: ""Don't ya know just to play with
    what you're given?""  And the straightforward Kinks-esque guitar and Appalachian
    drum stomp on ""Big Bad Man"" is great: ""Big Bad Man, lives all alone in the blue
    hills/ Everyone seems so scared of you/ I'm gonna cook you some real food!""</p><p>
    
    I admit, I was put off at first by Niblett's raw voice-- I'm not much for folky
    singer-songwriters.  But Niblett won me over with the last few songs, especially
    ""Ground Breaking Service,"" in which the funereal subject matter is set off against
    a surreal series of notes, eerily just out of tune.  The songwriting on these last
    few pieces matches the contrast between ""sweet"" and ""fevered"" suggested in the
    album title; my only suspicion is that Niblett is capable of greater work than
    this.  So I'm curious to see if she'll continue to sketch like this on the
    sidelines, or if we can expect a fuller portrait from the artist in the future.</p></div>"|5785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5785-sweet-heart-fever/|7.3|Christopher Dare

    musical outfit with Swedish origins and a predilection for psychedelia. Depending
    on the take, it's a concoction capable of sending you on a run to the nearest
    exit or reaching for the knob to crank the volume. What's more, prior to this
    year, the majority of the music world had never heard the name, much less
    encountered any of the music. Hence, a little rundown is in order:</p><p>
    For a brief period during 1967-68, Pärson Sound was a frontrunner in the
    burgeoning Swedish music scene, leading to a few shows accompanying Terry Riley,
    an opening gig for the Doors and an invite from Andy Warhol to play an art
    exhibit in Stockholm. Regrettably, no album was ever cut and the band's activity
    ended almost as soon as it began-- although later manifestations would emerge and
    continue under the names Harvester (sometimes known as International Harvester)
    and Träd, Gräs och Stenar (translation: Trees, Grass and Stones).</p><p>
    Up until this recent release, Pärson Sound was basically just a blip on a musical
    roadmap, their name appearing sparingly in Warhol articles or Swedish musical
    histories. So I'll let you in on a little secret. As January rapidly approaches,
    I can say this two-disc set is by far the most unexpected surprise of the year.
    Serving up a platter of archival recordings (rehearsals, studio and live cuts),
    this Pärson Sound collection is drug-addled psychedelic mindfuckery at its best.
    And that's just the beginning. Successfully marrying the ideas of rock, jazz, and
    drone experimentalism, this Swedish quintet sounds like it wasn't just trying to
    break free of the limitations inherent in each genre; at times, it sounds like
    they were trying to blow the doors off the hinges.</p><p>
    Opening the first disc, ""Tio Minuter"" (""Ten Minutes"") starts out quietly enough,
    beginning with a hushed guitar atop distant vocal chants. Don't let it fool you.
    It's a ruse. One minute in, the band forsakes the mesmerizing guitar for an
    intense, cacophonous clamor. Sounding as if someone suddenly set the stage on
    fire, Pärson Sound unleashes a grinding series of brutal guitar riffs. Stretching
    out beyond ten minutes, the band isn't content to remain in one sound territory.
    The track builds from a mammoth sludge-fest into a ringing guitar drone backed by
    the screeching sounds of Arne Ericsson sawing away at his electric-cello.
    Everything settles into a glacial pace near the end as the sounds of ghostly
    tape-lagged voices glide over each other, an invocation for the ether-regions
    (which makes sense-- séance is a credited instrument in the liner notes).</p><p>
    The blissed-out trance work continues with ""From Tunis to India in Fullmoon (On
    Testosterone),"" a miasmic sound orgy that drips with ecstatic energy.  It's a
    Bacchanalian noise festival, an acid-drenched lunar ride in which everyone is
    whipped into rapturous primal frenzy while Pan taps his hoof and bleats out the
    age-old hypnotic spell. Driving forward into free-jazz, ""Tunis"" finds Pärson
    Sound openly and aggressively exploring ideas through improvisation. The entire
    track is a swirling sound-world, held fast by Thomas Mera Gartz's pounding
    percussion. Guitarists Bo Anders Persson and Ericsson immerse themselves in
    locked drones, enticing out a series of resonating vibrations, while saxophonist
    Thomas Tidholm reels off a series of rasping moans and pain-filled squeals.
    Coalescing into a tight-knit entity near the end, Persson hammers out a delirious
    buzzsaw solo over the increasing urgency of Gartz's percussion. The resulting
    din is pure astrophysical beauty.</p><p>
    ""A Glimpse Inside the Glyptotec-66"" leaves the instruments behind, abandoning
    them for tape-looped guitar and Persson's lagged-voice experiments. Recorded for
    1966's Young Nordic Music Festival, ""Glimpse"" is a surprisingly early collage
    for guitar and voice that places Persson alongside contemporary minimalists
    Terry Riley and Steve Reich. Having captured several glittering guitar drones
    and sequencing them on tape, he slowly adds pre-recorded tapes of voice mixed
    with his live moans and vocalized syllables. ""One Quiet Afternoon (In the King's
    Garden)"" is a massive squall of noise. Again toying with pre-recorded tape
    experiments, Pärson Sound creeps along, drowning everything in a rumbling clatter
    (much of it produced from the feedback-saturated tapes). Howling, pre-recorded
    voices amble over each other while the tapes are either accelerated to furious
    speeds or slowed to a dazed crawl.</p><p>
    The second disc in the set both opens and closes with nascent versions of songs
    that would appear later on International Harvester's debut. Stretching to
    thirteen minutes, ""Sov Gott Rose-Marie"" is centered on a reverie-inducing guitar
    solo, but builds gradually into a frightening full-band chant of the title. With
    three members repeatedly intoning the title phrase, other instruments begin to
    pile up, climbing over each other and saturating the space. The result is a
    haunting, claustrophobic grumble filled with battered organ keys, pummeled bass
    strings and the fading remains of an earlier guitar drone.</p><p>
    A track that starts with smoldering embers, ""Milano,"" moves at an increasingly
    rapid piece as time elapses and Pärson Sound stoke the fire. Subsumed within the
    booming percussion and electrically charged cello, Persson leisurely constructs a
    guitar solo that moves swiftly from rattling mess to drifting murmur. Moving in
    a recurring pattern, Persson's guitar workouts are sprawling meditative journeys--
    shifting repetition often giving way to gradual movement and pulsing breath. With
    only five tracks per disc, the average length of each song is easily ten minutes
    or more, occasional stretching to the half-hour mark (the lengthy spiritualistic
    drone ""Skrubba"") and once or twice staying in the seven-minute range (the
    acoustic ""On How to Live""). In spite of this, any concerns related to length
    tend to dissipate once your head is fully submerged in the band's constantly
    inventive surroundings.</p><p>
    During their brief stint, Pärson Sound had a rallying cry of ""We, Here and Now!""
    that embraced their musical philosophy of a defragmented universal language. The
    time elapsed since their active years have seen a number of acts such as Amon
    Düül, Acid Mothers Temple, Bardo Pond and Taj Mahal Travelers traverse the same
    paths, garnishing accolades and international success. For a fan of any of these
    bands, or anyone fascinated by psychedelic, acid-blasted madness, this is ground
    zero.</p></div>"|6180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6180-parson-sound/|9.3|Luke Buckman

    peyote. After more than 20 years in the biz, often dismissed as a poor-man's Meat
    Puppets, Gelb's Giant Sand finally scored a critical breakthrough with 2000's
    <i>Chore of Enchantment</i>. Not many bands set a new high water mark for
    themselves with their eleventh album, but that's exactly what Gelb &amp; Co. did
    with their Neil Young-ish collection of desert hymns and ambient folkscapes.</p><p>
    
    So what does he do next?  Well, first he releases a fractured collection of
    oddball tracks and after-show parking lot recordings called <i>Confluence</i>,
    which, like most of the Gelb/Giant Sand discography, is hit or miss at best--
    the kind of album you listen to a few times through, then put on the shelf and
    wait for a few others like it to float through your transom before you burn your
    own ""best of"" compilation.  Now, a few scant months later, along comes <i>Lull
    Some Piano</i>, a collection of 19 (mostly) solo piano compositions.</p><p>
    
    Recorded at various locations, with some dating back as far as 1988, these songs
    are almost completely devoid of lyrics. Giant Sand bandmates Joe Burns and John
    Convertino (better known to some as Calexico) turn up on a few numbers, as do
    some samples and loops, but the vast majority of <i>Lull</i> is just Howe, 88
    keys, and a box.</p><p>
    
    And David Helfgott he ain't, but Howe plays better than most people probably
    expect. Given his fiery guitar work and corny sense of humor, I might have
    expected something more... I don't know, avant or experimental sounding, or at
    least something that would make me immediately wonder what he was thinking.
    Instead, Gelb keeps it nice and harmonic and proper, creating the kind of music
    you might play at a dinner party, which I guess is kind of risky in its own way.
    Gelb stays away from jazz or barrelhouse blues, preferring to stay in the
    classically influenced realm with a few diversions into Kurt Weill territory and
    that of movie soundtracks. In the end, I ended up asking myself anyway: ""what
    was he thinking?""</p><p>
    
    Now, sure, it's possible that <i>Lull Some Piano</i> is just a case of ol' Howe
    capitalizing on his recent upswing in visibility.  After all, he has almost
    attained indie rock ""elder statesman"" status by now, so he can dish out a
    collection of scraps and be virtually guaranteed that a relatively sizable
    audience will lap it up dutifully.  But it should be noted that all Gelb/Giant
    Sand releases over the last decade have been scraps collections at their core:
    Howe and his buddies hang out in their homes and studios, mess with their
    instruments till the sun goes down (or comes up), and then sift through the
    reels and see what's there.  With <i>Chore of Enchantment</i>, they just happened
    to strike gold. So, at the very least, you can't accuse the man of compromising
    his vision in the face of wide(r) acclaim.  But that said, <i>Lull Some Piano</i>
    is surely for diehard Sandheads only.  Or maybe for fans of the burgeoning indie
    rock dinner party scene.</p></div>"|3416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3416-lull-some-piano/|5.5|Jason Nickey

I know you do.  Just about everyone does these
    days it seems.  Maybe you even liked him before it was cool-- back before his
    songs weren't advertising for Volkswagen.  At any rate, if you're into the sad
    Englishman, you'll probably want to check out this James Hindle album.</p><p>
    
    First, let's give the guy some credit here.  James Hindle doesn't really sound
    like Nick Drake-- his voice is deeper, his diction is better, and his arrangements
    are a little less exploratory-- but he comes from the same English folk tradition
    that gave rise to Drake and scores of his contemporaries.  Born in Yorkshire, he
    made the move to London like a lot of great musicians eventually do, packing an
    acoustic guitar and a set of expertly penned tunes to show off around town.</p><p>
    
    To record his debut album, though, he made the trek from the foggy streets of
    London to the foggy hills of San Francisco, and it shows a little.  The sound
    here falls somewhere between that of Hindle's countrymen and Bay Area locals
    the Red House Painters.  There's an even more formal connection between the
    two than sound, though.  Producer and Badman founder Dylan Magierek is also
    responsible for the sound on head House Painter Mark Kozelek's two recent solo
    albums, and the atmosphere on <i>James William Hindle</i> is similarly dry and
    unaffected.</p><p>
    
    Hindle opens his debut with the steadily waltzing ""Down and Able,"" accompanying
    his midrange tenor with big, slowly strummed chords and loping arpeggios.  Former
    American Music Club skinsman Tim Mooney provides a stately pulse as Hindle
    transfers his heart from his ribs to his sleeve with lines like, ""Four weeks
    seems endless when you're stuck in the first one/ And it's four in the morning/
    It feels like the light will never come/ And I feel disastrous with all of my
    follies/ The usual misgivings and dangers.""</p><p>
    
    ""Remember My Markings"" adds a thoughtfully scored string quartet to the same
    basic formula, except this time, there's an even better melody for them to
    interact with.  The swelling cello and violin countermelodies trade off nicely
    with Hindle's vocal, culminating in one of the record's high points when Hindle
    is joined by former Tarnation vocalist Paula Frazer on the song's jaw-dropping
    bridge.</p><p>
    
    Hindle's voice and the strings are all you get on ""(Masks),"" which gives the
    song a rather stunning sense of loneliness.  It's followed by what may be Hindle's
    best original, ""The List of You and Me.""  The tempo is up a few notches as he
    declares, ""These are the days of our imperfection and this is where I feel at
    home,"" in the chorus over Dirty Three-inspired electric guitar-grind and layers
    of vigorously bowed violins.  Nearly as good is the song that follows-- ""Brooklyn
    Song"" is a spare track featuring Hindle and his guitar backed only by a thick,
    brooding cello line.  It wouldn't be too out of place on <i>Five Leaves Left</i>,
    if you had to know the truth.</p><p>
    
    Alongside all the originals are two inspired covers: a sufficiently twangy
    take on Glen Campbell's ""Less of Me,"" which closes out the set, and the true
    stunner, a remarkably personal version of the Bee Gees' ""I Started a Joke.""
    Hindle does for the brothers Gibb here what Mark Kozelek has done for AC/DC
    time and again, stripping away the pretense and posturing of the original and
    laying the lyrics and basic melody bare.  The result is a deeply sad, but not
    depressing, moment of quiet reflection.</p><p>
    
    If there's a criticism to level at James Hindle at this point, it's that he
    needs to work a little on developing his vocal delivery and expanding the
    range of his material slightly.  A few more songs would also be nice, as the
    album clocks in a little short at thirty-five minutes and eight tracks.  Still,
    for a nascent artist, Hindle's craft is quite well-formed and it seems as though
    he can only go up from here.  With any luck at all, he's destined to release
    some great records in the future.  Who knows?  Maybe twenty years from now, your
    kids will find out about him from some Volkswagen ad. Here's hoping the future
    will be a bit kinder.</p></div>"|3873.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3873-james-william-hindle/|7.5|Joe Tangari

Frontman Jarvis Cocker was 15.  He's now 38.
    Yes, that's a damn long time to be in a band, but surprisingly, the group's only
    original member wears it well.  Having withstood 23 years and an indeterminable
    number of line-up changes, you'd think that Pulp would long since have started
    repeating themselves.  But if there's anything these Yorkshire gents are not,
    it's stale.  In fact, it's possible that on <i>We Love Life</i>, they're fresher
    than ever.  Part of the reason for this is that they've always embraced change,
    constantly pushing in new directions.</p><p>
    
    Jarvis Cocker is still speaking up for the outsiders and freaks of the world,
    and the overt sexuality that's always informed his delivery is still a presence,
    but its context has changed completely.  Cocker's worldview has moved to an
    alternate plane since the libidinous come-ons of <i>Different Class</i> (perhaps
    their last album, the ultra-dark masterstroke <i>This Is Hardcore</i>, excised
    all of those urges).  Now, Cocker and the band seem to have grown into their
    station in life, the misfits stuck in the middle of the limelight.</p><p>
    
    Pulp worked with the legendary British producer Chris Thomas (who has produced
    everyone from the Sex Pistols to Roxy Music to John Cale, as well as playing
    session keyboard on the Beatles' <i>White Album</i>) for both 1995's <i>Different
    Class</i> and <i>This Is Hardcore</i>.  And they attempted to work with him again
    on <i>We Love Life</i>, but with the sessions half-finished, the band decided to
    scrap the tapes and start over.  They quickly decided on another British legend:
    songwriter Scott Walker, a man known for his seedy song topics and baroque
    instrumentation.  This switch in producers, having changed nearly everything
    about the band's sound, is immediately evident.</p><p>
<i>We Love Life</i> marches in with ""Weeds"" on top of Nick Banks' militaristic
    snare drum and unexpected layers of acoustic guitars.  For his part, Cocker
    essentially addresses the double standards that exist in our lives, driving
    especially hard at the image-conscious upper class who ""still come around to
    visit us when [they] fancy booze and drugs.""</p><p>
    
    This segues seamlessly into the trip-hoppish groove of ""Weeds II (The Origin
    of the Species),"" over which Cocker delivers one of his trademark spoken
    monologues.  Over a strangely EQ'd bassline, he deals in metaphors wherein
    the common folk are the weeds of society.  ""Weeds must be kept under control
    or they will destroy everything in their path,"" he sneers.  That's not an idle
    observation, either; it's delivered like genuine threat to some abstract
    authority figure.  The groove pauses to emphasize the point, evaporating briefly
    into an ambient ether before the band picks back up.</p><p>
    
    The album's other spoken track is even better, revolving around a recounting
    of a visit to the spot where a river has been diverted under a city.  Somehow,
    Cocker manages to conjure all of the dirt and grit of the littered sidewalks
    and faltering buildings without ever directly referencing them.  His personal
    changes are evident here, as well.  In 1995, he wrote to his boyhood crush,
    ""Let's all meet up in the year 2000/ Won't it be strange when we're all fully
    grown?""  Now that the year has come and gone, he seems resigned to the fact that
    he can never meet up with his lost loves or salvage the past.  Rather, he has to
    content himself with visiting the dam where they met, fantasizing about taking a
    trip down the river, beneath the city and the people living in it.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, we're treated to some of the best traditional songs that Pulp have
    ever written, in ""The Trees"" and ""Bad Cover Version.""  A brilliant string
    ostinato anchors the groove of ""The Trees,"" in which Cocker laments a lost
    love, similarly coming to terms with the fact that trying to get it back just
    isn't a possibility.  ""Might as well go and tell it to the trees,"" he sings,
    and it's at this point that you first realize that he seems to be seeking
    real emotional commitment far removed from the lascivious sportfucking that
    his older songs favored.</p><p>
    
    ""Bad Cover Version"" addresses roughly the same theme from a different angle,
    with Cocker smirkingly comparing his ex's new boyfriend to himself, offering
    that ""a bad cover version of love is not the real thing.""  The band's sense
    of humor enters the fray in the coda, and they even get in a jab at their own
    producer, likening ""the second side of <i>Til the Band Comes In</i>"" (Walker's
    fifth solo album) to an off-brand box of cornflakes and sugar substitutes.
    Other targets include ""the Stones since the 80s,"" the ""Planet of the Apes"" TV
    show, and the late-period ""Tom &amp; Jerry"" episodes where they could talk.</p><p>
    
    This is followed by ""Roadkill,"" an acoustic reflection on a trip to the airport
    to pick up the other half of a doomed relationship.  The narrator catches sight
    of a deer dying in the road, and in retrospect, takes it as a sign that the
    relationship was doomed to begin with.  From this emotional low point, though,
    comes the phoenix of ""Sunrise,"" the album's stirring closer and one of the most
    optimistic songs Pulp have ever recorded. ""I used to hate the sun/ Because it
    shone on everything I had done,"" begins Cocker, ultimately summing up the band's
    entire career: ""You've been awake all night/ So why should you crash out at dawn?""
    Pulp's long night may be over, but the day looks just as promising.</p><p>
    
    On their seventh album, Pulp have pulled off yet another remarkable reinvention
    of their sound and outlook, while simultaneously making their most organic album
    since their full-length debut, <i>It</i>, was released almost two decades ago.
    The cheap synths that made their last few albums so delightfully sleazy are
    almost completely absent, replaced by Mark Webber's well-developed guitar
    melodies and a more peripheral role for the electronics.  And that's all good,
    because the last thing I'd want is for Pulp to get stale on me.  On this evidence,
    it seems likely that they'll stay fresh well into the new century.</p></div>"|6507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6507-we-love-life/|8.2|Joe Tangari

What else do you call a guy willing to sabotage the futures and
    success of his children, the ones he helped bring in to the world, and the ones
    who presumably have the most to gain from his support?  Of course, there are
    always two sides to every story, but I figure when the tale involves even a
    little of the supposed foul play this one does, somebody is going to come out
    dirty.  So, what did the kids think of father, then?  No, not father-- Godfather.
    And it could've been a breakout success if only his reach hadn't extended so far.</p><p>
    
    This is the family feud that was James Brown's scene.  Sometime in the spring of
    1970, big brother Maceo Parker, Brown's main sax man since '64, got the idea that
    living under the funky thumb of the hardest working man in show-business was
    perhaps not a great deal.  Some say he rebelled, others say that it was simply
    time for a change of scenery, but whatever the case, bad deeds were done, and the
    only stuff to come out on the sunny end were a few sides of classic funk.</p><p>
    
    Father Brown had discovered Maceo (and his little brother, drummer Melvin) during
    a tour stop in North Carolina.  The pair was only just out of high school, but
    Brown knew a good feeling when he heard it and quickly snatched up the duo.  The
    brothers Parker joined the touring band, and were also featured on Brown's hit
    ""I Got You (I Feel Good),"" before getting picked up by another charismatic unit,
    the U.S. Army.  So, they served a different kind of tour for a few years, but
    returned in the late sixties (Maceo in '67, Melvin in '69).</p><p>
    
    Of course, going on the road with James Brown wasn't exactly all good times.
    Eating from papa's bag could be an infuriating exercise in humility.  Brown had
    the nasty habit of accepting any and all credit for the music issued under his
    name, despite the fact that riffs, arrangements and sometimes even entire tunes
    were created by his sidemen soldiers.  On top of that, he was never known as the
    highest paying bandleader.  So, it came to pass in May of 1970 that Maceo led a
    mini-walkout, taking almost all of JB's band with him.</p><p>
    
    The first record they made was under the moniker Maceo and All the King's Men,
    which is a good indication of the rebellion Maceo must have known he was
    committing.  They cut nine songs for the album <i>Doing Their Own Thing</i>
    (""Thank You for Letting Me Be Myself Again"" is a bonus track here), and issued
    one single in 1970.  Their music was tried-and-true funky soul and bar-band
    balladry, and not a lick of it was ever going to see the top 40 if Brown could
    help it.</p><p>
    
    Now, I should add that there's a considerable amount of uncertainty (at least on
    record) as to the exact happenings regarding Brown and this band of upstarts.
    The prevailing story is that the Godfather actually paid disc jockeys across the
    land not to play tunes by Maceo's bunch.  There's also the notion that the record
    was subject to merely bad distribution.  Whatever the case, all the King's men
    only had the opportunity to make one more album before disbanding.  Most of the
    guys went back to Brown, who seemingly welcomed them with open arms.  It's a
    dicey story, but in any case, some pretty nice music was left behind by one of
    the best bands never to have had a chance.</p><p>
    
    Fittingly, the album begins with ""Maceo,"" a slow, churning piece of hard funk.
    It's basically an excuse to have this band's leader blow a few choruses of his
    patented razor-sharp vamp-jazz.  He sticks to tenor here (Maceo didn't switch to
    alto until 1973), but there's no mistaking his tone and style for anyone else's.
    The tune features only the barest of melodies, and in fact, was probably the kind
    of thing that would've been stretched out to lather up a crowd in concert.  ""Got
    to Get 'Cha"" is more classic groove, and is actually still in the touring book of
    Maceo's band today.  This one actually features the sax man's distinctive vocals,
    owing much to Brown's guttural pounce.  Brother Melvin lays down a tight,
    mid-tempo beat, and the horns (including L.D. Williams on tenor and trumpeters
    Richard Griffith and Joseph Davis) nail the punches harder than Kool's Gang or
    a Tower of Power ever dreamed possible.</p><p>
    
    The band pays its respect to the Apollo showtune in jams like ""Shake It Baby""
    (double time, rock-n-soul revue party fare) and ""I Remember Mr. Banks"" (jazzy,
    hard-blues ballad, in the style of Allen Toussaint's early organ trio sides).
    These are the kinds of tunes that sound best in a room of crowded, sweaty people.
    For the first, make room to shake everything you got; for the second, grab your
    girl and slow jam every waking second that Griffith's aching, muted trumpet
    wails.</p><p>
    
    After the short stint on their own, most of the band's members would continue to
    perform with Brown, in addition to further solo ventures and stints with other
    acts (most notably the P-Funk mob).  Today, Maceo leads his own soldiers across
    the world playing the same old funky music he's been playing over the course of
    the last few decades.  And from what I've read, he doesn't hold any grudges
    against a certain mentor who may have stalled this initial effort.  Of course,
    Parker has long since been given his due by a new generations of fans, but I
    still wonder what old JB thinks of the kids that tried to branch out into their
    own thing.  You know what they say about payback.</p></div>"|6172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6172-doing-their-own-thing/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    a hyper-caffeinated crew of (likely underpaid) staff members determines when to
    phase out musical vocabulary (grunge, new wave) after its moment has passed.  As
    we speak, the staffers in this proverbial chamber have been squabbling over the
    term ""emo"" for going on two years. Raw-nerved from lack of sleep and tense from
    infighting, the panel sits amidst overflowing ashtrays, greasy take-out boxes,
    coffee cups, and empty Tums containers.</p><p>
    The Chairman slumps as the rookie panel member takes off his shoe to thump loudly,
    Khrushchev-style, across the table.</p><p>
    ""We must retire the word 'emo,' says the rookie. ""It's applied to everything,
    and means nothing.""</p><p>
    A sleepy advisor laughs. ""It never did.""</p><p>
    ""You are making fun of me,"" says the rookie.</p><p>
    ""You seem so opposed to use of the word 'emo.' What do you suggest we use
    instead?"" asks the Chairman.</p><p>
    The rookie folds his hands across his chest. ""It would depend on the band, sir.""</p><p>
    The Chairman shuffles through the CDs at the center of the table. He pulls out
    Aveo's <i>Bridge to the Morning Lights</i>, and places it in the stereo system.
    The room is flooded with the sound of a slightly off-key muted tenor wail.</p><p>
    ""Sounds like Morrissey,"" says the sleepy official.  ""But not as good. Are these
    guys from England?""</p><p>
    ""Seattle,"" says the chairman.</p><p>
    ""Then what's with the accent?
    ""It's all part of the act. The Smiths thing. You can hear it in the guitars,
    too."" He shifts it to track three. ""This is the title track, but tell me if you
    don't think it's a dead ringer for 'This Charming Man...'""</p><p>
    ""I don't see what this has to do with the topic at hand,"" says the rookie.</p><p>
    ""Everything,"" says the sleepy official. ""Fetishizing the Smiths in general, and
    Morrissey, in particular, have been cornerstones of the emo subculture for years.
    Not to mention that the seemingly deliberate, slightly off-keyness of the vocal
    delivery recalls the Promise Ring.""</p><p>
    ""Aveo's a fairly new band,"" says the Chairman. ""This is their debut album. Its
    nine tracks are sequenced in reference to loosely connected anecdotes about
    sadness, alienation, suicide, roadtrips, and ennui, which are delivered somewhat
    tongue-in-cheek in the liner notes.  Lyrics are derived from the cunning
    extraction of certain lines from these stories.""</p><p>
    ""So?"" asks the rookie. ""Sounds like Belle and Sebastian. You wouldn't call Belle
    and Sebastian emo.""</p><p>
    ""Well,"" says the chairman, ""I personally don't think Belle and Sebastian sound
    all that much like the Smiths. And despite the seemingly glib tone of the liner
    notes, the super-heartfelt vocal delivery makes me question Aveo vocalist/guitarist
    William Wilson's ironic intent. It sounds too earnest. Also, consider ""End of
    This Dull Continent,"" the second track. That staggered time signature, the guitar
    parts cribbed from Death Cab for Cutie, the slow build from quiet and barely
    rocking to a little louder and...""</p><p>
    ""Slightly more rocking,"" says the sleepy advisor.  ""Though I take issue with the
    word 'rocking,' sir.""</p><p>
    ""Let's leave that be,"" says the Chairman.</p><p>
    ""But what about 'Neverhome'?"" asks the rookie. ""It's upbeat and there's an
    accordion.""</p><p>
    The sleepy advisor scoffs. ""Again, sounds like the Smiths.""</p><p>
    ""And I'd like to take this moment to inform the whole panel that the band's
    name, Aveo, is the Latin word for 'I desire.'""</p><p>
<i>[collective groan]</i></p><p>
    The sleepy advisor nods. ""But you know, for the record-- and its possible
    categorization under a disputed term aside-- this album isn't really terrible.
    Perhaps a bit boring-- all the songs sound mostly the same-- and derivative.
    And some of the tracks are pretty good.  ""Higherness,"" for example, has a nice,
    driving beat, and comes closer to rocking than most of the album. Also,
    ""Tomorrow Today"" is catchy as hell, and could vie for great song status if only
    the guitars weren't so resolutely pleasant and William Wilson wasn't so
    determined to sound like Morrissey.""</p><p>
    The rookie slides back into his chair. ""You're gonna call this emo, aren't you?""</p><p>
    ""Well, I could just call it Heavily Inspired By The Smiths and leave it at that,
    but considering the demographic likely to purchase and enjoy this record, emo
    wouldn't be too much of a stretch. Also, the overall sound-- the plaintive vocals,
    the pretty melancholy, the cheerless self-indulgence... I mean, how much more of
    a recommendation do you need?  Like you said, we apply the word 'emo' to
    everything.  We could just call it indie rock, but tell me the last time that
    meant anything at all.""</p><p>
    ""Maybe you're right.""</p><p>
    ""I know I'm right,"" says the Chairman. ""And on that note, I think it's time for
    all of us to go home.  Tomorrow, we start on xFC-metal, so get some rest.""</p></div>"|386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/386-bridge-to-northern-lights/|5.5|Alison Fields

    majority of its reviews will begin with a summary of that event. But those who
    know anything about the actual Haymarket Riot of 1886 know that such predictability
    would not be in keeping with its spirit. After all, it was supposedly anarchists
    who really got the party started at the Haymarket, Illinois labor protest, tossing
    a bomb into a group of policemen and killing seven of them (though some reports
    blame the police).  In memoriam, we'll postpone the summary for later and get
    right down to labor... er, business.</p><p>
    
    Haymarket Riot, not surprisingly, hail from Chicago, Illinois. The quartet has an
    aggressive sound, dominated by two elements: shrill guitars, which attempt their
    fair share of angular counterpoint, and the treble attack of the bass tone,
    molded into kinetic, choppy basslines. Every member of the quartet contributes
    on vocals; the band often employs a ""team shouting"" approach, with an occasional
    melody line mixed in for contrast (they've drawn comparisons to Fugazi, for good
    reason). As a package, the Haymarket Riot sound is forceful, disquieted, and
    genuinely intense.</p><p>
    
    The success of Haymarket Riot's song structures sink or swim with the effectiveness
    of the guitar/bass interplay. You find this a lot with bands that use the Riot's
    favored tones and textures.  Independent of one another, the elements can sound
    pretty obnoxious. It's when the band hits on an equilibrium that they balance and
    perfect the approach.  And when that happens, they achieve a sound both fierce and
    compelling.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately for Haymarket Riot, they have a difficult time reaching that
    equilibrium.  For example, on ""Wax!,"" the bass and guitar are clearly aiming for
    counterpoint; they just never connect with one another. Other times, elements
    seem misplaced and superfluous, like the closing guitar riff on ""A Needle That
    Skips.""</p><p>
    
    What holds the band back most, though, is their impatience.  Haymarket Riot will
    hit on an appealing theme, then move on long before the motif is adequately
    ""milked."" So it is with ""(The) Fight."" It begins with some pep as the drums
    warm up to a breakbeat, but the band proceeds to wander into a straight-ahead
    punk frolic, then later to standard down-tempo balladry.  And at the end, they
    revert to more of the punk thing they started in the middle of the track, failing
    to deliver what the song's intro promises.  Bad moves all-around.</p><p>
    
    Restless, shifty compositions can sound great (e.g. Don Caballero), but the
    changes, even when totally unpredictable, need to make sense together. Haymarket
    Riot often fails to accomplish this; they sound like they're messing with
    dynamics just for the hell of it, or out of a sense of obligation. Occasionally,
    the experiment works; ""Technicolor Bombs,"" ""Immaculate,"" and ""Castor Oil"" are
    all at least coherent. Still, even of those, only ""Castor Oil"" sticks with you
    after the disc stops spinning.</p><p>
    
    So, what happened was that the anarchists bombed the cops, which subsequently
    derailed the eight-hour-day movement, and led to the hanging of four people who
    probably had nothing to do with the bombing in the first place. Thanks to the
    Haymarket Riot, American industry had free-reign to exploit workers well through
    the turn of the century.  And 115 years later, a post-punk band got named in
    its honor.  Love those politics.</p></div>"|3779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3779-bloodshot-eyes/|6.5|Brad Haywood

Pythagoras thought he did.  Or at least he
    theorized that the heavens were organized like the earth, in a geometry that you
    could define and study.  Music was another aspect of that model, and the octave
    intervals that sounded pleasing to the ear represented basic mathematical fractions.
    He suggested that the planets should be spaced in similar numerical ratios, and
    therefore, their movements in orbit would resonate sonically-- slower stars at a
    lower pitch, faster stars at a higher.  Who knows, the Pythagoreans might even
    have been on to something; recently, one astronomer has shown that meteor trails
    emit low frequency radio waves, which could be picked up by certain things on the
    ground like pine needles or even frizzy hair and converted to sound just as you
    see the fiery trail streak across the sky.</p><p>
    
    I used to hear the music of the spheres from Orbital.  Even if their early singles
    weren't direct recordings of planetary alignments, you could imagine hearing
    ""Chime"" or ""Halcyon + On + On"" at a club in the rings of Saturn.  Techno that
    elegant was practically the reason for the shift to the term ""electronica.""  I
    remember the confusion when <i>Snivilisation</i> dropped in '94; some rave kids
    weren't used to such intricate melodic detail and concept albums about societal
    trends.  But two years later, brothers Phil and Paul Hartnoll followed up with
    <i>In Sides</i>, one of electronic pop music's all-time classic albums, a perfect
    mix of dancefloor dynamics and emotional intensity.</p><p>
    
    On 1999's <i>The Middle of Nowhere</i> they seemed to fall off a bit.  The beats
    were still lively but the melodic inventiveness was too often stranded for cheap
    diva vocals and other sundry fills.  Alright, I admit-- their newest project has
    been like some wretched fairytale stepchild at <i>Pitchfork</i> staff meetings
    for the last half-year, the target of furrowed brows and disappointed sighs but
    never quite mentioned by name.  But hell, someone had to break the news eventually.
    The album title is mostly accurate: <i>The Altogether</i> is just that, a bunch
    of samples and stuff all thrown together.  In short, wack.</p><p>
    
    The lead song actually promises of new directions.  ""Tension"" draws a buzzy
    bassline from the Bananamen's cover of the 1964 top ten hit ""Surfin' Bird"" and
    thrusts it into one of Orbital's hardest floor-fillers.  Some sampled rocker dude
    groans over the bumped-up BPM and a Hartnoll trademark: oscillating synth
    ululations that freak out all over the equalizer.  The other amazing track was
    stuck at the very end, I'm guessing to put a pretty cover on the rest of the
    pulp.  ""Meltdown"" may have been prepared for a dance troop in London's south
    bank, but don't expect Dieter prancing around in black.  It begins with this
    delicious, dirty jungle beat before busting into a concrete symphony of telephones
    beeping, typewriters clacking and analog whine.  It would have fit nicely on
    either of the companion discs to <i>In Sides</i>.</p><p>
    
    But then, for balance, the tracks that must have led Sire execs to blow a load:
    ""Waving Not Drowning"" recycles an acoustic guitar riff into an infinity of Belle
    &amp; Garfunkel acid-trip excess.  Fold your hands, Hartnolls, you loop like My
    First Logic Audio.  And then there's the atrocity of ""Illuminate,"" a milquetoast
    synth-pop number to which folkster David Gray (Phil Hartnoll's brother-in-law)
    lends sappy vocals.  Sting is spilling his frappuccino somewhere in frustration
    that this Welsh guy beat him in such a craven appeal to adult contemporary radio.
    Only in the clueless U.S. would marketing goons have failed to pipe this into a
    Wal-Mart near you.</p><p>
    
    In-between, results are mixed.  ""Funny Break (One Is Enough)"" is too much, really,
    as Naomi Bedford breaks apart a tribal-techno rhythm with her attempt at lyricism:
    ""This love is drivin' me crazy!""  Whatever happened to the wordless ethereality
    of Alison Goldfrapp's incredible vocals on tracks like ""Sad But True?""  Instead
    we get ""Oi!"" in which Ian Dury's sampled sax wanks along with yet more diva
    constipation and trance synth-bass so generic Eskimos &amp; Egypt would have been
    embarrassed to use it on one of their early-90s rave anthems.  At least the
    boutique-friendly subtlety of ""Pay Per View"" is inoffensive, but it's still
    by-the-numbers Orbital, nothing you haven't heard before.  ""Tootled,"" which is
    constructed from samples of Tool's ""Sober"" and anarchists Crass, just rehashes
    Orbital's collaboration with Kirk Hammett on the <i>Spawn</i> soundtrack.  And
    ""Shadows"" should have been dumped with the TV pilot it was written for-- the dark
    Underworld ambience teases, but then enter the operatic wailing.  You might dig it
    if you still have a jones for Apotheosis' ""O Fortuna.""</p><p>
    
    Oh, and then there's the ""Dr. Who"" theme novelty remix.  See what I mean?  It's
    not that Paul and Phil shouldn't be allowed to have any fun; it's just that ""fun""
    should never be an excuse for not doing the absolute best you can do.  They've
    also been tossing about the term ""for laughs"" a lot in recent interviews.  But
    if they think goofing off in the studio is funny, the joke will be on them when
    not many are laughing along.  In ten years, you'll be mistaking their superficial
    work here for the Chemical Brothers, Crystal Method, or Fatboy Slim's big-beat
    bullshit.  I guess it's a sign that techno has entered the establishment-- as
    with recent disappointments from U2, REM and Depeche Mode, so, too, with the
    Orb, Aphex Twin and now Orbital.  It's just a shame to hear such a lack of
    ambition from true pioneers.  The duo used to be a focal point around which
    constellations of sound revolved.  These days, they've set their sights on stars
    with far less luster.</p></div>"|6032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6032-the-altogether/|5.2|Christopher Dare

    I don't know if you've heard of me but I'm a rapper/producer from South London
    England and I've just released a record called <i>Run Come Save Me</i> that I
    thought might be of interest to you. I also just wanted to let you personally
    know how much that track you did with Shabba Ranks meant to me when I was first
    starting out.  It really opened my eyes to new forms of expression in hip-hop
    music.  Anyway, I've included a copy of my new CD.  I'd love it if you'd let me
    know what you think of it. Thanks!</p><p>

    Manuva,</p><p>
    Don't fucking kid yourself, I know the act.  Seems like things are going nice for
    you right now, and honestly, I'm happy for you.  I think you're a good kid.  But
    this new album you sent me, what the fuck?  I don't even know where to start on
    this bullshit.  The first track, it's called ""No Strings,"" but actually it's
    nothing but strings. I guess you think you're doing something very clever here.
    Rodney, fuck, listen to me: it's just tepid. All of it. You're riding the wave
    of novelty right now. I didn't rhyme my way out of the motherfucking gutter
    on <i>NME</i> hype.  If you stay on this path your next stop's gonna be a Thievery
    Corporation cameo.  All your reviews begin with, ""Where else will you hear
    someone rapping about [insert Britishism here]?""  Who gives a fuck about ""ten
    pints of bitter?""  You were never lyrically stunning, to say the very least, but
    at least you were listenable; now it's like trying to sit through a blunted
    knock-knock joke with no punchline. To make it all somehow worse, the only real
    (read: American) MC on the whole thing is that clown from J5 on ""Join the Dots,""
    and he's easily the worst lyricist in the history of this rap shit. Namedropping
    Anthony Kiedis, for fuck's sake, Rodney, that's unforgivable. I dunno, maybe the
    words would be a bit more palatable if not for your voice. Oh, that voice.
    Christ. On your first album it seemed like your rugged (yawn) vocal stylings
    were almost something close to fresh, but now with the production thinned to the
    most boring minimum (and after hearing too fucking many two-step raga shouters),
    a weak cockney sputter just doesn't hold my interest at all. Everything on here
    seems stolen, and not just because the (unintentionally?) shaky religious doubt
    of ""Sinny Sin Sin"" comes directly from my <i>On Christian Hypocrisy</i> chapter.
    You've jumbled all the flaws of every ponderous underground hip-hop animal into
    a confusingly repulsive (and, lest i forget, British) MC. It's a bad thing.</p><p>
    So your voice is dry, the rhymes are shook (""the return of the Rootical one?""
    What the fuck?) and, hate to say it, but the beats are worse than ever. A damn
    shame, too, because your last had some incredible tracks. ""Clockwork"" was one of
    the hottest old world moody-style joints of '99 for sure. How did your skills
    behind the boards slip so bad? It's sad to see the guy who effortlessly floated
    on the grainy charcoal-sketched Mobb Deep wail of ""Movements"" driven to the
    hollow two-note keyboard loops and boring dirgy bass of almost every track here.
    Grotesque bids at dance cred are strictly 1997. I paid my dues with Goldie
    already so you can sit the fuck down. Honestly, I can't even believe UK
    ""electronica"" culture is coming out for this languid failure anyway.  It's
    certainly no more rewarding in the club than back at home. Here's some production
    advice: lay off the fucking weed! I borrowed from dub's framework to get hardcore
    bounce-back, you're just coming off with funkless rewrites of Shaggy's
    ""Boombastic"" injected with ill-conceived pretension. At this point, even Wu got
    you bested on the reggae-rap front and they're just half-heartedly fucking around
    with it. Better luck next time.</p><p>
    Peace,<br/>

    they were the embodiment of late 90s emo-rock, playing with an intense abandon
    that displayed the extent of their ambition.  The problem was, the ambition
    seemed uncontrolled, and the album came off like an emotional effigy of the
    band's aspirations which their experience wasn't quite capable of making fully
    palpable.  Last year's <i>Mare Vitalis</i> found them reigning in their sound
    and softening the edges while simultaneously beginning to experiment with new
    textures.  The album ended with an extended untitled track of feedback and guitar
    loops that no one could have predicted was the fuse to what was coming next.</p><p>
<i>Low Level Owl</i> is a supernova and a full redefinition of the band, a
    sprawling two-disc monster that redirects their ambition from the emotional
    release of their earlier albums into the meticulous conceptions crafted through
    endless hours of studio time.  Overhauling their sound and incorporating a wide
    mélange of styles, <i>Low Level Owl</i> goes a long way towards emasculating any
    of their previous hardcore influences by injecting a thoughtful, gentler Britpop
    jangle and winsome vocals and harmonies.  The result is a mix of elements
    combining the enterprising studio conceptions of Radiohead with touches of
    shimmering Stone Roses psychedelia knitted together with the conviction and
    energetic drumming of the early U2, all draped over a monolithic prog-rock
    conceptual framework.</p><p>
    The technical execution throughout the album is flawless.  The rock tracks are
    spread evenly across both <i>Low Level Owl</i> discs (which are available
    separately-- <i>Use Your Illusion</i>-style-- presumably so as to not overwhelm
    listeners) and are interspersed with instrumental and ambient tracks that act as
    connective tissue.  Josh Baruth's fantastic drumming is placed in the front of
    the mix and propels all of the traditional songs.  Each of the tracks are awash
    in keyboards with the vocals generally lying low in the mix, making the lyrics
    difficult to decipher.  These are the only constants through the entire work as
    Appleseed Cast takes you on a tour through most of the highlights of 90s pop and
    rock.</p><p>
    Both albums are balanced, each beginning and ending with instrumentals and
    connected in the middle by the droning ""View of a Burning City"" that ends the
    first disc and picks back up on the second.  The combination of ""The Walking of
    Pertelotte"" and ""On Reflection"" clocks in at 8\xBD minutes, and bookends the front
    of the project.  Over an hour and forty-five minutes later, ""Confession,"" a
    nine-minute ambient head-trip closes the second disc.  Both albums last fifty
    three minutes.  Just the arrangement of the music alone shows the amount of
    thought that goes into an album of this size.</p><p>
    Hints of other bands occur throughout-- from the Stone Roses in ""Mile Marker,""
    to My Bloody Valentine in ""The Argument,"" to Built to Spill in ""Reaction""-- all
    embedded a lush wave of production reminiscent of the Flaming Lips, Spiritualized
    or Mogwai.  There are also elements of Brian Eno and Aphex Twin that pop up
    during the ambient sections, and tracks like ""Flowers Falling from Dying Hands""
    which remind me of Sonic Youth's ""Providence.""</p><p>
    Needless to say, Appleseed Cast have come a long way since that 1998 debut of
    frail failure.  With <i>Low Level Owl</i>, they establish their own unique vision
    for the future of rock, offering hope and brighter possibilities for the genre--
    or rather, creating their own.  These two albums have generated an incredible
    amount of hype in small sects of the indie rock population, while most who
    haven't been privy to the band's peerless new sounds still associate the band
    with their sensitive suburban roots.  It's time to look past the stereotype and
    herald Appleseed Cast for what they are now, and what they're about to become:
    groundbreaking.</p></div>"|260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/260-low-level-owl-vol-i-ii/|9.0|Nathan Rooney

    with so many great tunes because Harrison felt creatively stymied in the Beatles
    and was able to bring massive amounts of the good noise during the post-breakup
    closet-cleaning. It's said that you can hear the joy in Harrison's voice on that
    album, joy that came from him finally being able to take what was inside and show
    it to the world. Having listened to the album for the first time in a while this
    past week, I'm inclined to agree.</p><p>
    I hear some of that same joy on the second album by Mazarin, the band led by
    Quentin Stolzfus, former drummer for Azusa Plane. Stolzfus only played drums for
    the band part-time, as a chunk of the Plane's music was too drony to require
    extra percussion work. But this guy was wasting his talent dragging a violin bow
    across a ride cymbal; he's a songwriter with a real melodic gift.</p><p>
    Leaving the 20-minute d-chord mediations behind, Mazarin finds Stolzfus crafting
    punchy pop tunes with a rootsy edge. Acoustic guitar provides the foundation, the
    melodies are sung in two- and three-part harmony, and there's a countrified folk
    cast to <i>A Tall Tale Storyline</i>. And though this may sound like a backhanded
    compliment, some of it reminds me of <i>Girlfriend</i>-era Mathew Sweet. It's
    nowhere near as slick a record as that comparison would suggest, but both
    Stolzfus' voice and his 60s-inspired arrangements bear some similarity. And hey,
    I like <i>Girlfriend</i>.</p><p>
    ""Go Home"" opens <i>A Tall Tale Storyline</i> with the album's only bit of drone
    music, a whine that shifts gears and becomes crystalline, west-coast pop about
    three minutes in, complete with wordless vocal interplay and ringing guitar
    strums.  It's no surprise when the eventual lyrics include the line, ""Going back
    to California."" The eight-minute opener is an anomaly; much more typical is the
    3\xBD-minute ""What Sees the Sky?,"" with layered vocals that make you think there's
    got to be a Crosby, Stills or Nash hiding in the studio somewhere, and Byrdsian
    guitar chimes on the simple, effective chords.</p><p>
    The acoustic guitar is used to different effect on ""2.22.1"" and ""RJF Variation 1,""
    two lovely variations on the fingerpicking instrumental folk of John Fahey and
    Leo Kottke. ""My Favorite Green Hill"" could be one of the rock tunes on REM's
    <i>Life's Rich Pageant</i>, and ""The Limits of Language"" is almost pure country,
    complete with pedal steel and a Nashville lilt to the rhythm.</p><p>
<i>A Tall Tale Storyline</i> is a diverse record, but all genres covered have
    their origins in American roots music, so the feel is unified. Mazarin can seem
    just a bit dilettantish at times (the straight county is just not terribly
    convincing somehow), but the stakes feel low, and this is an easy record to like.
    So consider putting those Azusa Plane records back on the stack, opening the
    shades, and giving the drummer some.</p></div>"|5166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5166-a-tall-tale-storyline/|7.5|Mark Richard-San

I have emotions. Sometimes I will get angry. Sometimes I will get sad.
    And sometimes I will even get extremely excited. Sometimes, when I am feeling any
    of these things, I will pick up a guitar.  Sometimes these emotions will elicit
    a few words and a melody. Thus, I am inevitably doomed to emo-dom. Right?</p><p>
    No, there are a few other requisites before I can officially be welcomed into the
    mediocre ranks of the emo-kids. My voice must be intoned with a slight whine, I
    have to be pleading for my girlfriend to stay because she's in all of my dreams,
    and I must learn the ingenious and utterly effective juxtaposition of ""soft"" and
    ""loud."" Right?  Perhaps. But in the end, one shouldn't automatically dismiss bands
    that follow the classic emo formula; I mean, Death Cab for Cutie's last record was
    actually quite delectable for the most part, despite the fact that Benjamin
    Gibbard's predominantly major-key melodies start to melt together after extended
    exposure.</p><p>
    So we've established that emo is easily pigeonholed, but not always of terrible
    quality. But then again, there's definitely a reason why emo has such a bad
    reputation. Take Boylion's first record for MOC, whose title is derived from the
    classic cheat code to Konami-brand ""game paks"" for first generation Nintendo.
    One could immediately interpret this choice of title to reflect the banal and
    sophomoric quality of the aural material contained in the microscopic ridges of
    plastic, and one would be dead on. This is the music of the band that every high
    school in suburban America seems to have-- five emotional pre-twentysomethings
    trying to break the punk mold with a bit of melody and keyboard.</p><p>
    The 50 seconds of ""Gentle Robots"" starts off the record innocuously and even
    hints at an attempt on experimentalism that aims to remold the inevitable cliché.
    The instrumental begins with a clean electric guitar strumming, eventually
    accompanied by some outlandish keyboard arpeggiating, which fades into the second
    track, ""Seton,"" where not only the experimentalism (if you could even consider it
    that) fades, but the seedy production enters as well. The song sounds as if it
    were encoded to MP3 at 98kpbs then mastered, with paper-thin sounding drums,
    rubbery bass, and an airy, filtered drum track.  And how about a serving of
    high-school science class poetry: ""I rush to embrace both you and this moment.""</p><p>
    ""What Matters Most"" kicks off with a double-tracked Matt Roan (as if one were
    not enough) screaming: ""She's begging me to stay."" Roan continues his romantically
    infatuated musings on priorities backed by a speedy one-two beat and a simple,
    happy-go-lucky organ line.  ""Find Me"" slows things down with a pretty piano and
    more lines about-- guess what!-- crumbling relationships, then kicks into high
    gear for the loud and speedy chorus before returning to a super effectual verse
    with simple harmony vocals.</p><p>
    So, to sum things up, this quartet with a shopping cart full of feelings makes
    songs with power chords and keyboards and rhythm changes that will make you
    question what would happen if these kids listened to Miles Davis. It seems that
    they have perfectly good intentions with those quasi-experimental bleeps and
    bloops, frenetic tempo and volume changes, and some pretty, yet clichéd, melodies.
    But in the end, these directions in music are anything but new.</p></div>"|896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/896-up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-b-a-select-start/|3.5|Christopher F. Schiel

    the <i>longue duree</i>. History's typical subject matter, politics and war, were
    but weather fluttering above the passage of a deeper time-- the time of soil and
    seas, the rise and fall of populations, the global transit of diseases, the
    expansion of economies. Beneath the speeches and explosions, history creeps along
    in the long span; perhaps it was all slower than anyone might have imagined.</p><p>
    
    Though bound to the seventy-five minute surface of a compact disc, Portland's
    Jackie-O Motherfucker have discovered the secret of making music in the <i>longue
    duree</i>. Masterminds Jef Brown and Tom Greenwood, along with the platoon of
    weirdo outrock soldiers of fortune with whom they surround themselves, have been
    crafting the perfect antithesis to the millennial strain of gloomy post-rock,
    a genre dominated by the likes of Mogwai, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, and the
    lately touted Explosions in the Sky. Against the ubiquitous music of crisis,
    Jackie-O has managed to make a very serious case for the music of continuity.
    Its sheer joy and wonder reside neither in tension nor resolve, neither verse
    nor chorus, but simply in dogged perseverance.</p><p>
    
    Last year's breathtaking <i>Fig. 5</i> unfolded in the deep time of the American
    musical past. The album simply eroded the strata of one musical epoch after
    another, as if beneath it all there was some secret to be disinterred. The dusty
    x-ray on that record's cover served as the perfect manifesto for the album:
    underneath all this, somewhere there must be bone, a frame and foundation that
    holds it all together.</p><p>
<i>Liberation</i> has no such quest; it is rivery and meandering, with no
    discernible source or mouth.  <i>Liberation</i> simply travels, picking up junk
    and jetsam along the way, discarding it somewhere downstream, and rambling on.
    Beginning somewhat arbitrarily with the clatter of ""Peace on Earth,"" one gets
    the distinct feeling of having suddenly and for no apparent reason been made
    privy to the secret sound of everyday life. Drums tap out a hesitant shuffle.
    The plaintive vibraphone chatters brightly. The strings drone and yawn as if
    they were the innards of some great machine that makes everything turn. The
    guitars enter into the fray, commanding some sense of direction, but to little
    avail. One might compare the proceedings to the drone jams of Spacemen 3's
    <i>Dreamweapon</i>; both render dissonance rather precarious-- as if a song
    could emerge from the noise at any minute. But ""Peace on Earth"" never really
    resolves into a stable entity. After ten minutes, ""Peace"" simply shuts the door
    on the listener, as if never meant to be heard.</p><p>
    
    The similarly lengthy ""Ray-O-Graph"" owes much to the dreary Celtic fog perfected
    by the Dirty Three. Above the programmed drizzle of the drum track, the guitar
    and strings manage to recreate the seasick interplay of Mick Turner and Warren
    Ellis. Jackie-O Motherfucker add squiggly sound effects and softly squawking
    horns to the mix, giving the track a kind of drunken stagger. The twanging
    ""Northern Line"" sets the sweet voice of Jocelyn Goldsmith above the throbbing
    backporch Americana that dominated <i>Fig. 5</i>, serving as a transitional piece
    in much the same way as the similarly lilting ""Beautiful September"" did on the
    previous album.</p><p>
    
    The twenty-minute ""In Between"" cycles like seasons through sparse, wintry branches
    of bare guitar and lush passages of noise in full bloom. The fierce and nimble
    free improv drumming is easily the track's strongest suit; they're recklessly
    creative even when the guitar minimalism grows somewhat tiresome. As an exercise
    in patience, the first ten minutes of ""In Between"" is masterful; but musically,
    the point is made early on and is barely expanded upon. The second half, however,
    erupts into backwater freakout, bleeding the thin twang into thick distortion
    like some confederate Sonic Youth.</p><p>
    
    The subtle and engaging ""Pray"" intertwines a spare and beautiful guitar line in
    slithering electronics. Vibes, organ and several guitars slowly begin to flesh
    out the sound, transforming skeletal country into irresistibly creepy psychedelia
    on the order of Popol Vuh. The guitars skitter off into mock-sitar, sax crows in
    the corner, yet the restraint and economy of ""Pray"" is almost saintly.</p><p>
    
    There is a stubborn lag to <i>Liberation</i> that some will no doubt find
    infuriating. Lacking the focus and narrative of <i>Fig. 5</i>, <i>Liberation</i>
    occasionally plays like molasses. But the album is nonetheless beautiful, for
    the consistently amazing quality of Jackie-O Motherfucker is their ability to
    color experimental music and noise with more candor and emotional sophistication
    than most turtlenecked troubadours. But it takes time. And time might just be
    the instrument played with the most brilliance on <i>Liberation</i>: sped up,
    slowed to a crawl, made to stand dead still and maybe even at times, dismissed.
    The stereo display times this album at seventy-three earthly minutes, but I'm
    not quite sure how long the music has really been around. Seems like ages.</p></div>"|4186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4186-liberation/|8.0|Brent S. Sirota

Hide your daughters and
    old Paul Simon tapes, because no one will be spared.  You thought Wendy Carlos
    was a joke?  Oh no, she/he was only the beginning.  And it gets worse.  You see,
    it turns out that this is one revolution that, no matter how seemingly
    intimidating and complicated (let's face it, the Borg are most likely listening
    to Autechre), is probably for the best.  The more I delve into new music, the
    more I find it contaminated by the all-assimilating force that is electronic
    music production.  Older artists are stepping over their fanbase to work with
    techno producers, while the young ones are throwing away subscriptions to <i>CMJ</i>
    for old <i>Beatfreakery</i> rags.  The good and bad news: most of the stuff
    sounds no worse than your average zeitgeistmusik.</p><p>
    And there are a thousand stories in this revolution: David Bowie outdoes Trent
    Reznor in the late 90s, and I realize why that isn't such a great deal; scores
    of bands rip off Can and Cluster and call it ""post-rock,"" wondering why Stereolab
    fans think they're boring (Stereolab fans!), and some end up pretty decent.  To
    me, though, the coolest stories are the ones that end up like Rotoscope.</p><p>
    Norwegian composer Andreas Mjøs formed the electro-acoustic outfit Rotoscope
    in autumn 1999.  With an eye towards Warp and Ninja Tune, he started the band
    in an attempt to reconcile the purely electronic music played in clubs with
    modern experimental music, all with the idea of playing live.  The band features
    musicians from all walks of arty life: classical composers, jazz players, pop
    singers, orchestral musicians-- it's a something of a brainstorming session for
    the tuned-in and overachieving.  And they sound neat, too.</p><p>
<i>Great Curves</i> is the band's first album, though for the most part, it
    sounds as if these guys (and one gal) are old pros at putting stuff to DAT.
    All of the tunes are messed with, mostly on the production end, as the band
    and co-producer Jørgen Træen seem to have an inexhaustible array of effects,
    loops and otherwise unnatural doings transpiring.  Some people call this stuff
    IDM (an inadequate description at best) or electronica (a stupid term altogether),
    but there are too many roots in traditional sounds and structures here to give
    all the credit to machines.</p><p>
    ""Press Stop"" begins things with a bang and a glitch, as percussion and wailing
    saxophone are cut up beyond repair, put through who knows what number of
    computer-generated filters and patches.  It's quite short, but it most certainly
    sends the right signals: this isn't going to be your average jazz-informed indie
    statement.  ""All That You Owned (Remix),"" something of a skittish, distracted
    ballad, is the first tune to feature the childlike vocals of Christine Sandtorv.
    Distant, sometimes-backwards piano, record-scratch atmospherics, and a bassline
    that only occasionally makes itself at home in the proceedings peep in and
    out in no discernable order, turning what could have been a simple tune into the
    most complicated two-minute ""song"" I've heard in a while.</p><p>
    ""The Bogota Sub"" is born out of the distortions of the previous tune, and quickly
    launches into more glitches and computer-chaos.  However, the unmistakable feel
    of acoustic percussion and horns are all over this track (and the rest of the
    album), and despite the fact that actual humans could probably never play this
    way live, the tune isn't far from some kind of future jazz groove I imagine would
    sound great while overdosing on two or three media of your choice.  Try, the
    soundtrack to watching three television sets at once, two of which are broadcasting
    the end of 2001, and the other Godfrey Reggio's <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>.</p><p>
    ""Cooks Whip, Music Goes On"" makes a jazz noise or two, especially via Lars
    Horntveth's ultra-suede tenor playing during the solo break in the middle.
    Real drums drop some real groove, vibraphones vibe, and for the most part, I
    find it very easy to label this ""modern jazz.""  But labels suck, so I'll
    stick with ""stuff that sounds like jazz, if it were made be people listening
    to new music-- and by new music, I don't mean the new Lenny Kravitz"" music.</p><p>
    Other tunes are much closer to the purely electronic realm, such as ""Watercooler""
    or the Talking Heads-referencing ""Divide and Dissolve.""  These tunes may have had
    roots in acoustic/live performance, but are subject to so much post-production
    that they could probably pass as straight IDM in most quarters.  The former is a
    brief display of reverb-laden drum machine blips and bangs, with a by-now familiar
    (in electronic music, anyway) disorienting, distorted glitch presence.  The
    latter is a lengthier percussive exhibition, steering closer to jungle theory
    (as defined by new Boredoms, not Goldie) than post-everything sensory overload.
    After a restrained intro, things get rather out of hand, what with all the
    hurricane toms and rocket ship engine thrust noises.  I'd say it was all too
    much, except it's such great stuff.</p><p>
<i>Great Curves</i> ends with the epic ""Traveller,"" which brings vocalist
    Sandtorv back into the mix, and excludes almost everything computer-generated.
    Hypnotic keyboard motive aside, this is a fairly addictive song.  Sandtorv's
    singing could be a potential source of annoyance, particularly for anyone who
    isn't down with girly-girl vocalizing, but it seems to fit well here.  In
    any case, her section of the tune ends quickly, leading to an instrumental
    vamp with layers and layers of Horntveth's woodwinds and some nice acoustic
    guitar.  It reminds me a little of the last tune from <i>Idiology</i>, but
    these guys play soulful where Mouse on Mars was cinematic, and assured where
    the German duo was innocent and playful.  An intriguing finale to a release
    with that's almost always at odds with what a band given their instrumentation
    should sound like.  Recommended.</p></div>"|6840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6840-great-curves/|8.2|Dominique Leone

    electronic music. I myself have even thrown it into a review or twenty, so I
    may as well take a stab at a definition, however awkward: I use ""organic"" to
    describe sound that seems derived from some kind of primordial logic or process
    that gives the illusion of falling outside the realm of human creation. It has
    something to do with structure, process and product being integrated in a way
    that the final piece seems whole and complete. When music is organic, I find
    myself contemplating the work as a singular entity instead of adding up the
    individual pieces.</p><p>
    
    Oval comes to mind when I imagine the ultimate in organic music. When I listen
    to Oval-- particularly his last three records-- the man behind the music
    disappears and I'm interfacing directly with the aggregate sound as a living
    thing in itself. I know Markus Popp had reasons for placing this crackle here
    and this glitch there (he is the designer, after all), but the logic of the
    micro seems unfathomable. Listening becomes a top-down process.</p><p>
    
    I mention the idea of the organic in the context of Richard Devine's <i>Aleamapper</i>
    because this music is the diametric opposite of the word.  This album, which
    serves as a darker, dronier companion to this year's <i>Lipswitch</i>, is a
    thread of disconnected fragments streaming by endlessly, like metallic objects
    on an assembly line. The whole is invisible; all you can make out are the dead,
    inert chunks of material.</p><p>
    
    This is machine music divorced from the lifecycle, where the digitally derived
    sound sources are so clearly a product of powerful computers that if I close my
    eyes, I can almost see the scrolling window of Cubase in preview mode. But all
    this is not to say that the record is bad; in fact, the direct ""man at the
    computer"" vibe of <i>Aleamapper</i> makes good sense in the context of the
    overall mood. But I only want to listen to such music occasionally, in a very
    specific time and place.</p><p>
    
    For most of <i>Aleamapper</i>, Devine eschews the beats in favor of moody,
    rumbling ambient atmosphere. But there are a few moments of the frantic, cut-up
    funk that marked <i>Lipswitch</i>. Upbeat tracks like ""Vecpr"" and ""Step Focus""
    are steeped in electro, but miles removed from the robotic party jams of
    Grandmaster Flash and the Egyptian Lover. Like the pioneers of Detroit techno,
    Richard Devine sees the cold and isolated heart of the cyborg, but unlike them,
    he never inverts the gloom with a dose of dancefloor transcendence. In fact,
    only the gorgeous bed-of-clouds drone of ""Float 82"" allows any sort of respite
    from the ugliness of <i>Aleamapper</i>.</p><p>
    
    The reference point that keeps coming to mind is Tokyo-based sound artist
    Christophe Charles, who released a compilation of his work on Mille Plateaux in
    1997 called <i>Undirected 1986-1996</i>. Charles used field recordings as sources
    for his collages (he provided Markus Popp with recordings of bells for
    manipulation for Oval's <i>Dok</i>), and arranged them randomly using a computer
    program that can also be found on his CD (Mac only, dammit). Charles' use of
    chance operations gave <i>Undirected</i> an unpredictable feel that <i>Aleamapper</i>
    lacks, but both records contain long passages comprised of disorienting pieces
    of sound in relentless motion.</p><p>
    
    Devine has done a nice job putting it all together, and remember, he <i>meant</i>
    for the stitches to jut out like red, swollen welts. But still, there's something
    here that keeps me at arm's length, and I feel stationary and somewhat removed
    from the action as the sounds stream by. In any case, <i>Aleamapper</i> is a
    bleak tunnel of inorganic sound to be journeyed occasionally.</p></div>"|2302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2302-aleamapper/|6.3|Mark Richard-San

    of coherence. Ovuca's previous releases have been scattershot blasts of intense
    drill-n-bass, piano interludes, flute warbles, and the like. Rephlex, it's seemed,
    would release anything Perälä commits to tape.  But <i>Wasted Sunday</i> sees what
    is possibly the first time Perälä has handed over an entire album's worth of
    worthy material.</p><p>
    Perälä has said that small critters that frequent a park nearby him inspired the
    sound of <i>Wasted Sunday</i>. Taking that oddball statement to be true-- big
    gulp of credulity-- squirrels, sparrows, earthworms, and sundry other varmints
    must not care for shredding beatcore techno or portentous piano solos à la
    <i>Drukqs</i>. <i>Wasted Sunday</i> provides all creatures with precise and happy,
    yet considered, IDM. It's time for zoologists to rework their calculations of
    squirrel IQ.</p><p>
    Don't let the rodents have all the fun, though. There's no reason why creatures
    higher up the mammalian phylum shouldn't scamper friskily during the delightfully
    naïve ""Gas Bubbles"" or the all-too-brief Boards of Canada vs. Nobakazu Takemura
    clash ""Albert Questionmark."" ""Afternoon Girl"" situates the breakbeat electro of
    labelmate Kosmik Kommando in a perpetually twilit land where fawns frolic in a
    beautiful place out in the country. The brooding melodicism of ""Treetment"" could
    have partially redeemed <i>Vespertine</i>'s ponderousness, had Björk press-ganged
    Perälä into her IDM battle squad. ""Innocent Pedestrain"" weaves a toytown rave
    tune and some harsh TB303 acid bubbles into a spacious serenity reminiscent of
    Akotcha's chill-out classic, ""Go Sub.</p><p>
    That serenity ensures that all the hostility Ovuca's aggro-rave EP <i>King
    Stacey</i> incurred is dispelled in seventy minutes of leftfield chill. However,
    I very much doubt that <i>Wasted Sunday</i> marks a change in Rephlex's A&amp;R;
    policy. With the forthcoming release of Cylob's rendition of ""What Shall We Do
    With a Drunken Sailor?"" the label appears intent on maintaining its
    maverick/maniac rep.  <i>Wasted Sunday</i> may be a blip, but what a gorgeous
    blip it surely is.</p><p>
    I'd like to upbraid Perälä on one detail, though. If this album is what he'd
    consider a wasted Sunday, he's not trying hard enough.  I've always made a clear
    distinction between wasted and merely unproductive.  I determine whether a day
    is unproductive when I fail to make any headway with my laundry or with the
    compilation of this year's Christmas card list.  A day is wasted when I've
    fristered it away, pondering, say, whether there's any mileage in computational
    ceramics.  If Perälä is being gauchely self-deprecating about this album, that's
    the only error I think any seasoned IDM'r could charge him with.  But if not, and
    he knows he can do better, why waste a Sunday on creating simply pleasant music
    when you could be forging a masterpiece?</p></div>"|6068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6068-wasted-sunday/|7.4|Paul Cooper

    lads from the suburbs of Chicago, set forth to establish a bold new civilization
    in the mythical Land of the El Caminos.  In the Land of the El Caminos, anything
    is possible, provided believers accept the following tenets of the El Camino
    gospel:</p><p>
    
    1) Archers of Loaf is the greatest of all time.  However, the prevailing genre
    must always be Southern California-style pop/punk.</p><p>
    
    2) That the only true music must be a marriage of the above band and genre.</p><p>
    
    3) Instruments such as the keyboard, piano, and xylophone should be integrated
    into standard guitar/bass/drums arrangement, even if no one can play them.</p><p>
    
    4) Anybody can be a rock and roll legend.</p><p>
    
    Unquestioning acceptance of these four precepts guarantees listeners everlasting
    happiness in the Land of the El Caminos.  Little hard to swallow?  You're not
    alone.</p><p>
    
    Despite their website's claims to the contrary, it's hard for me to conceive of
    Land of the El Caminos really getting off the ground in any context outside of
    a sports bar on a weekday night, where patrons are already so soused and heavily
    involved in watching The Game that the band's unfortunate sound fades into
    background noise. And perhaps Land of the El Caminos is aware of this. Maybe the
    title of their third album, <i>Subourbon</i>, pays homage to their barroom
    enthusiasts-- though to be perfectly honest, it seems that Land of the El Caminos
    fans would more likely be drinkers of Budweiser than Jim Beam. But why quibble?</p><p>
    
    Well, because their sound quibbles with itself.  In some sense, it's generic
    enough.  <i>Subourbon</i>'s first track, ""Slouching in My Spine,"" sounds a lot
    like Face to Face circa 1995, or some such power chord/machismo-heavy pop/punk.
    Except the verses are punctuated with these completely extraneous, wacked-out
    metal guitar solos, and the vocals are delivered by a mostly tone-deaf Eric
    Bachman impressionist whose overt adoration of the late Archers of Loaf is
    suggested even in the song's title.  Now add some goofy production quality-- of
    the sparkling clean variety-- that does nothing so much as illustrate how awkward
    and distasteful this combination actually is.  Presto!  <i>Subourbon</i>.</p><p>
    
    That being said, ""Slouching in my Spine"" is one of the album's best tracks.
    Namely because it doesn't involve clumsily handled keyboards-- like ""We Never
    Learned How"" which sounds a lot like ""Slouching in My Spine,"" except more like
    Archers of Loaf with a little Weezer thrown in for good measure-- or intense
    lyrical discomfort.</p><p>
    
    But in the spirit of giving credit where credit is due, the lyrics to eight of
    the album's eleven songs are penned by Lara Fanelli (wife? sister of Dan?), who
    is not in the band. Her lyrics, though boring, are not bad.  But when Dan goes
    it alone, the results are questionable at best.  Consider the case of ""Heaven.""
    The song is preceded by the recitation of a haiku (I'm not kidding), and opens
    with the following: ""Heaven is where you spray everyone in the face with your
    love/ I'm never gonna see your face again/ And how could you sleep with that
    motherfucker?""</p><p>
    
    Clearly, in the gospel of the El Camino, the afterlife is envisioned in a wholly
    original light.  Fanelli further elucidates on ""Rock Star Dream,"" a fairly
    straightforward Blink 182-ish ditty concerning ""a heaven so full of all that's
    beautiful,"" including ""guitar rock angels both big and small.""</p><p>
    
    About the only thing I can say for Land of the El Caminos is that they're
    consistent in their odd hodgepodge of influences. Without the added effect of
    instrument and lyrical misfortune, the songs settle into a forgettable haze of
    mid-90s nostalgia and those old MTV buzz bin bands that sold CDs on the basis of
    one boring song and a colorful video. Does anyone remember Wax? I'm betting Land
    of the El Caminos hopes you do.</p><p>
    
    Yet, there's something so sadly likeable about these guys.  They're hard working,
    sincere, committed.  They've put out three records on their own label, and you
    can imagine the high fives as they drive off to the next show. All the onstage
    banter about ""doing it for the kids,"" a complete lack of pretension mediated by
    their inability to even feign pretension, the good intentions...</p><p>
    
    Perhaps one day the Land of the El Caminos will find their ideal audience. Some
    small segment of the population so amped up on pop/punk and Archers of Loaf.
    They'll fondly coalesce under the Land of the El Camino banner, following their
    heroes from barroom to barroom. And every night the band will pause for a moment
    of bliss, seeing heaven as their fans spray their faces with love.  Bless their
    hearts.</p></div>"|4663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4663-subourbon/|1.2|Alison Fields

    tones, and a pair of phonographs specially designed to play at different speeds
    and used them to create music. The result, a piece entitled <i>Imaginary Landscape
    No. 1</i> is commonly regarded as the first piece of turntable music. Though a
    few other avant-garde composers of the time would follow Cage's lead, it would
    be decades before the turntable's capacity as a musical instrument would truly
    be explored again.</p><p>
    
    The 80s and 90s saw the simultaneous rise of the CD as the premiere form of
    recorded music and of the turntable as a musical instrument, as the discoveries
    of a few kids in the Bronx gave birth to a musical movement the likes of which
    they could never have imagined. The last few years have seen the turntablist
    break free of his connections with the realm of hip-hop, with DJs turning up in
    bands of every shape style and form. Meanwhile, artists like Christian Marclay
    and Kid Koala continue to push the limits of what can be done with a few record
    players.</p><p>
    
    Still, despite the turntable's newfound commonplace status, one can't help but
    get the feeling at times that turntablists are the Rodney Dangerfields of the
    music world. No respect and all that. In the minds of many, the turntablist is
    not a musician, but a presenter of music. Of course, this assumption is
    ridiculous. As anyone who's tried their hand at manipulating vinyl will tell
    you, there's far more to it than just dropping a needle and pressing play. Still,
    it often seems that no number of amazing feats performed upon the wheels of steel
    will ever change the minds of the doubtful masses.</p><p>
    
    Certainly, the turntables have attracted their fair share of drugged-out ravers
    and lazy would-be musicians. We've all been to parties where wannabe-DJs did
    little more than play one record after another, and we've all been bored to death
    by some guy at some lame club whose experimentation never developed past a simple
    beatmatch. But these half-assed DJs are nothing more than the turntable equivalent
    of your girlfriend's brother, sitting in the garage with his out-of-tune thrift
    store guitar, playing along to Weezer tabs he downloaded online.</p><p>
    
    Real DJs-- those
    who take their art with all the seriousness of the most skilled classical pianist--
    often show more ingenuity and creativity in the use of their instrument than most
    so-called ""real musicians."" And logically so. The turntable isn't like a guitar
    or a piano; there is no preconceived ""proper way"" to play it, no set of rules,
    no charts or theory to learn. It's a skill wide open to interpretation, and as
    such, the best turntablists are constantly redefining their craft, finding new
    approaches to making sound.</p><p>
    
    Take <i>Now, Listen</i>, the newest release from DJ Food (a rotating team of
    musicians whose lineup currently consists of PC and Strictly Kev) and
    co-conspirator DK, for example. Technically speaking, this is a compilation of
    other people's music-- a mix CD. But the credit for the album lies, without a
    doubt, in the hands of the three who assembled it. It's important to note that
    I'm not just praising the musical tastes of the trio at the helm here. Any DJ
    worth their salt can compile two-dozen worthwhile tracks with his or her eyes
    closed. What makes or breaks an album like <i>Now, Listen</i> is flow. And DJ
    Food have it in spades.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, it's the long-practiced, well-polished ability of all the artists
    involved here to paste together bits of sound into a cohesive whole that makes
    <i>Now, Listen</i> far more than just the sum of its parts. Equal parts hip-hop,
    jazz, dance, experimental, rock and IDM, all pasted together with an assortment
    of vocal samples (a trademark of the Solid Steel show), the record serves as a
    fine introduction to the sort of freeform radio these guys have been putting
    together for years.</p><p>
    
    Since 1988, when Matt Black and Jonathan More (today you know them as Coldcut)
    took on a weekly late-night, freeform radio program on a London pirate radio
    station, Coldcut's weekly ""Solid Steel"" program has served as an outlet for
    turntablists more interested in making music than playing it. The thirteen years
    since have seen a lot of changes to the program. Today, ""Solid Steel"" is broadcast
    on one of London's best-known radio stations, streamed over the Internet and
    syndicated the world over. The show frequently plays host to guest DJs
    (Squarepusher, Tortoise, most of the Ninja Tune clan, etc.) and Coldcut's hosting
    duties have been split with DJ Food's Strictly Kev, while producer DK's role has
    expanded to encompass realms both creative and technical.</p><p>
<i>Now, Listen</i> is the first in a proposed series of discs intended to
    recreate the spirit of these broadcasts. Starting off with a crackly old big
    band recording before quickly jumping ship into a torrential ocean of scratches
    and samples, the work of the DJs is immediately apparent. After the introduction,
    we're off with Jeru the Damaja-- rapping and scratches-- mixed seamlessly with a
    downtempo instrumental by the Cinematic Orchestra. From this point on, it becomes
    more and more difficult to tell one ingredient from the other.</p><p>
    
    There's an old saying in the DJ world that you can give 80 DJs copies of the same
    record and you'll never hear it played the same way twice. If only that were
    actually the case. Recent mix albums by DJ Spooky and Fila Brazilia have
    disappointed, despite excellent ingredients, due to less-than-thrilling mixes.
    In each of these cases, the DJs did little but build short bridges between the
    songs, their contributions limited to the first and last few seconds of each
    track. DJ Food and DK, on the other hand, use turntables, effects pedals,
    samplers, and sound clips from film and television and vinyl to cause their
    chosen songs to bleed together like cheap colored paper left out in the rain.</p><p>
    
    Take the seamless layering of a Ray Bradbury monologue over David Shire's
    horn-heavy suspense-thriller-style ""The Taking of Pelham 123."" Or the Herbie
    Hancock-discussing-his-love-for-electronics sample from ""Nobu"" that flawlessly
    links tracks by Four Tet, the Art of Noise and Boards of Canada. Or the
    amalgamation of Mr. Scruff's minimal electro-funk groove ""Ug,"" with the
    relentless verbal flow of Motion Man's ""The Terrorist"" and Peshay's drum-n-bass
    opus ""Miles from Home."" Sure, there are missteps, like the failed attempt to
    turn the Beat's ""Mirror in the Bathroom"" into an IDM track by setting it to
    Mask's Aphex-ian ""Square Off.""  And while rare awkward moments like this may
    disrupt the album's flow from time to time, there are more than enough treats
    here to make up for it.</p><p>
    
    Suffice it to say that <i>Now, Listen</i> is one hell of a ride from start to
    stop, that DJ Food is doing things with turntables that no one else is, that
    more often than not it's impossible to tell where the original songs end and the
    mixing begins, and that this is an album that deserves to be heard, by lovers of
    DJ culture and skeptics alike.</p></div>"|2358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2358-solid-steel-presents-now-listen/|8.4|David M. Pecoraro

This event
    becomes slightly more meaningful when one takes into account that all my life
    I've had a constant need for music, the type which leads people to use words
    like ""unhealthy"" and ""obsessive."" I've always been that guy who just can't stand
    to be someplace where music isn't. I'm the one who makes a straightaway for the
    CD player or the turntable the moment he steps foot in a silent room, even if
    I'm only planning on staying for a minute or two. To this day, I'm shocked that
    the guy I shared a room with as a Freshman in college didn't stab me to death,
    as night after night I kept him awake, myself unable to sleep without the aid of
    my stereo.</p><p>
    
    And yet, there came a point when I swore off carrying around Discmans and
    cassette players.  This was around the same time that I heard Gastr Del Sol's
    <i>Camoufleur</i>. About six minutes into <i>Camoufleur</i>, as the first song
    nears to a close, the live percussion drops out. It's replaced with a recording
    of two girls lighting firecrackers in a field, but the switch is so seamless that
    the listener doesn't even notice until, as the song winds down, we hear an
    unidentified voice telling the girls that it's okay, they're only recording them
    blowing off firecrackers and not to stop.</p><p>
    
    This had a profound effect on me. The idea that sounds could be music, too-- it
    was so simple that I'd missed it all along. My eyes newly opened, I shed my
    headphones and I began to notice the world of music that bombarded me with every
    step I took; the imperfect beats of rain dripping on metal, the roaring crescendo
    of an oncoming train, the chorus of car horns and voices that's borne from every
    city street. Not only did my view of the world change, but so too did my view of
    music. If all these wonderful sounds existed, then why did everyone insist on
    sticking so exclusively to guitars?</p><p>
    
    It wasn't long after this that I would discover John Cage and find many of my
    suspicions confirmed. In a speech delivered at a convention of the Music Teachers
    National Association in 1957, Cage explained: ""In this new music, nothing takes
    place but sounds: those that are notated and those that are not. Those that are
    not notated appear in the written music as silences, opening the doors of the
    music to the sounds that happen to be in the environment."" He went on to compare
    his work to ""the glass houses of Mies van der Rohe [which] reflect their
    environment, presenting to the eye images of clouds, trees, or grass, according
    to the situation.</p><p>
    
    ""There is,"" he concluded, ""no such thing as empty space or an empty time. There
    is always something to see, something to hear.""</p><p>
    
    Cage attempted to demonstrate such theories through pieces like ""4'33,"" which
    consisted of a musician sitting at a piano, playing absolutely nothing for four
    minutes and thirty-three seconds. Though dismissed by many as pretentious
    nonsense, there was a point to such exercises. Cage wanted his audience to
    realize that there was no such thing as silence. He wanted them to come to
    understand, just as he had, that the sounds inherent in the world around us--
    particularly those we most often ignored-- were just as important as those we
    might normally associate with music.</p><p>
    
    These very same precepts lie at the core of Olivia Block's <i>Mobius Fuse</i>.
    Block, a twenty-something living in Chicago, plays mastermind to music that
    makes equal use of live musicians, field recordings and minimal pops and crackles
    she calls ""lo-fi electronics."" More likely to lead a group of musicians from a
    table behind the audience, holding numbered cards beneath an office lamp to
    signify the beginning or end of different segments, than she is to play the
    traditional part of the conductor, hers is a unique mind. And with <i>Mobius
    Fuse</i>, it has given birth to something truly stunning.</p><p>
    
    The first thing I noticed when I popped <i>Mobius Fuse</i>-- a 32 minute movement,
    the result of nearly three years of field recordings, musical sessions, and
    painstaking mixing-- into my CD player was... well, nothing.  The record begins
    with silence. After about a minute, noise begins to seep in like red wine spilt
    on white fabric. Warm pops, like scratches on film, and almost-mute chirping that
    could just as easily be a distant recording of crickets or plain old feedback
    fill the air for about 40 seconds, before they disappear back into the foggy
    silence. This is a game Block plays with her listeners, manipulating many of her
    field recordings to the point where they still form an image, only it's a blurry
    one, its source often impossible to identify. When the sound reemerges, the warm
    pops are accompanied by the undeniable sound of crickets up close. But soon, this
    revelation, along with the sound, fades.</p><p>
    
    For a half-hour more, a whole spectrum of sounds meander in and out. Some are
    field recordings. Some are electronic noise. Some are traditional instruments--
    Block employs a six-horn ensemble (including well-known Chicago talent Jeb Bishop
    and Kyle Bruckmann) and sampled drums and cymbals. The horns sound lush as can
    be, though their tone varies little. The horns' part is so static for a couple of
    reasons. For one, the point here is not to create music, but to contrast sounds--
    or better yet, to explore the ways in which all sounds are alike. But more
    importantly, complex horn arrangements would detract from all the other sonic
    nuggets <i>Mobius Fuse</i> has to offer. As it is, the horns are just another
    part of the mix, never threatening to overwhelm the other sounds, and allowing the
    samples to develop an emotional weight usually thought of as connected to
    so-called ""real instruments.""</p><p>
    
    When Block presents us with a thunderstorm or the sound of firecrackers exploding,
    it's impossible to tell which sounds are from the recording and which are
    machine-made clicks. And by the time the horns bleed in for the last time, you'll
    have grown so used to hearing them right alongside wind, birds, bugs, ice and
    tape static, that you may not even register the change.</p><p>
    
    But it's in the silence, every bit as much as the sound, that the true magic
    lies. It's in the waiting, the quiet meditative moments in between sonic spurts
    that come on like a rush of adrenaline, that so much of <i>Mobius Fuse</i>'s
    beauty is hidden. Here, Block has assembled a deceivingly simple work of utmost
    subtlety. It's a work imbued with as much, if not more, emotion and complexity
    as anything released this year, but it will only reveal it to those listeners
    willing to dig far beyond the surface.</p><p>
    
    In the 1950s, John Cage predicted that as experimental music (or ""structured
    sound,"" as he liked to call it) continued to develop, our musical language would
    change with it. Terms like ""resonance"" and ""discordance"" would no longer be
    relevant. Instead, he suggested, our conversations would consist of terms like
    ""music"" and ""non-music."" <i>Mobius Fuse</i> is one of the most unique listening
    experiences I've come across all year, largely because it so effectively melds
    these two sonic landscapes together, because it recognizes that there isn't all
    that much setting the two apart. And by letting these soundscapes fade-- not only
    in and out of one another, but in and out of sheer silence as well-- Olivia Block
    shows us that silence has every bit the ability to transform and transport as
    the most beautiful of sound.</p></div>"|803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/803-mobius-fuse/|9.3|David M. Pecoraro

    is, ""Well, are you going to be a serious band or a jokey band?""  Somehow, this
    decision determines the fate of the project from day one.  Add humor and you
    risk losing credibility or failing outright. Serious musicians might be boring,
    uninspired or just plain untalented, but at least they're not making butt jokes
    while they're at it.  Yeah, there are novelty artists that do it right, but even
    while someone like Weird Al might even be considered a genius, it's rare to find
    anyone who's pulled a life lesson or greater sense of being from one of his
    songs. (Don't send me e-mail about if you have, please.  I don't want to know
    you.)</p><p>
    
    Furthermore, obscure is humor in the sub-genre of avant-garde electronic music,
    so stultifyingly number-happy with its fiendish grins lit only by the trusty
    Powerbook.  And Blectum from Blechdom can sound like that-- several tracks on
    <i>Haus de Snaus</i> take the esoteric high road-- but there's something more
    to it.  Kevin and Blevin Blectum (both girls, for the record) are confrontational,
    theatrical, and absurd.  And somehow, these three elements augment their appeal,
    drawing Wesley Willis-weaned punk kids and icy digitalis alike to their records
    and shows.</p><p>
<i>Haus de Snaus</i> is a chronological compilation of the duo's debut EP
    <i>Snauses and Mallards</i>, and its successor <i>De Snaunted House</i>. A
    serious majority of <i>Snauses and Mallards</i> has a sucking and splatting
    quality to it, where one channel whoops to the other's tick, playing back and
    forth in the stereo field.  Of these tracks, ""Shithole"" pulls out the harshest
    Kid606 trash-style sample of the whole album, which generally stays in the dark,
    tranquil nether-regions typically reserved for ambient Coil.</p><p>
    
    The opening of <i>De Snaunted Haus</i> is a testament to Blectum from Blechdom's
    amazing growth.  The first three tracks run together, distressed but with a sort
    of collage-oriented organization, like cut-up styles of White Noise or even the
    United States of America.  This is when the whimsy, which lays low for the
    majority of <i>Snauses and Mallards</i>, takes full force.  ""Going Postal (It Is
    the Right Time)"" combines a weird lounge-waltz with evil undercurrents and
    long-lost radio vocals.  The tight seduction of ""Right Time, Right Place"" works
    from a stolen hip-hop beat as rather unmelodic blocks of sound bump against one
    another, brutalizing the rhythm as it pushes through the song.</p><p>
    
    Then, terrifyingly enough, begin the skits.  The Girls Blectum send their voices
    through pitch-scramblers and backwards reverb and take on roles of little boys,
    evil snauses and impatient mothers.  Though not funny in the traditional sense,
    the pieces are strangely disturbing, especially placed between the lo-tech dance
    tracks that form the majority of the album.  In lieu of <i>Snauses</i>' ambience
    comes mania-- frazzled tracks sway out of control, interspersed with
    funny-the-first-time tales of missing toes, bloody messes and angry mommies.</p><p>
    
    The final track, ""In Case You Forget, We Talked on This Record,"" perhaps calls to
    critics wanting more from the mellow facelessness of <i>Snauses and Mallards</i>,
    and perhaps projects others' annoyance with the ""wasted"" album time devoted to
    the duo's rather mundane playacting.  But if anything, Blectum from Blechdom
    show with this release that their growth isn't so much one of maturity as it is
    of a willingness to experiment; one of the two new bonus tracks tacked onto the
    end of <i>Haus de Snaus</i>, ""In Search of the Non-Stop Party Planet,"" goes
    Autechre just to say it can, sucking in light and space until finally collapsing
    into an all-out, digital breakdown.</p><p>
    
    Though just a sampling of Blechdom's early material, <i>Haus de Snaus</i> does
    show a lot of promise for what the duo could eventually become.  More recent
    works, like ""Always Frank,"" their contribution to the awesome <i>Tigerbeat6,
    Inc.</i> compilation, see them headed in a direction where their chaotic sense
    of humor melds perfectly with more updated electronics and even guitars.  So
    while they're just a really good novelty band now, there could well be a time
    in the not-so-distant future that sees Kevin and Blevin making music as insane
    as their comic personas.  And that will be a good day.</p></div>"|798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/798-haus-de-snaus/|7.5|Daphne Carr

    They have the unique ability to ruin an otherwise good band all by themselves.
    Don't agree? When's the last time you were downright annoyed by a guitarist,
    drummer or bassist-- not by their personality, but by their playing? Unless you
    subscribe to <i>Bass Player</i> magazine, I'm guessing this doesn't happen very
    often. The musicianship might be uninspired or mediocre, but rarely does it
    single-handedly ruin a band. Vocalists are another story all together.</p><p>
    
    This is basically the situation between me and Check Engine's self-titled debut:
    enjoy the music, can hardly stand the lyrics and singing. It's like King Crimson
    all over again.  Robert Fripp &amp; Co. have never been able to find a suitable
    vocalist or lyricist. As a consequence, their two best albums are easily <i>Red</i>
    and <i>Lark's Tongue in Aspic</i>, two albums mostly devoid of lyrics. And
    actually, Check Engine's brand of ultra-precise, frenetic guitar noodling
    strongly suggests a heavy Crimson presence in the band's collective record
    stash. A lot of early Zappa, too; some of these melodies are straight off of
    <i>Hot Rats</i>. It's art-rock focused through the lens of late 70s post-punk.</p><p>
    
    Before I get too far ahead of myself, I should mention that Check Engine is an
    offshoot of the Chicago-based math-rock band Sweep the Leg Johnny, featuring
    saxophonist/vocalist Steve Sostak and guitarist Chris Daly. In fact, if I didn't
    know any better, I would think this was Sweep the Leg Johnny. There are differences,
    but it's nothing too pronounced. Sostak's alto sax still holds major sway over
    the proceedings, but with two guitars and two singers going at it as well, there's
    enough happening in the high range to keep ears busy wandering down the
    interlocking melody lines as if in a garden of forking paths.</p><p>
    
    That said, the rhythm section is Check Engine's real strength. After the first
    few times through this album, I found myself listening almost exclusively to the
    drums and bass. In terms of young rock drummers, Brian Wnukowski's drumming is
    the next best thing to the Dismemberment Plan's Joe Easley. And Wnukowski's way
    of interacting with bassist Paul Joyce is nothing short of exhilarating. Not
    that the other elements are all lace and frills, but after the first few seconds
    of the brief and blistering album opener, ""Where's my Social Worker?,"" it becomes
    apparent that Check Engine build their songs from the rhythm section up, which
    they are smart to do-- they know where their bread is buttered. It gives the
    music a visceral, gritty, and almost bluesy feel despite the fact that the guys
    seem incapable of playing in strict 4/4 time.</p><p>
    
    Which, of course, brings us to the vocals.  As I've said, they're not so hot.
    Try as I might, I just couldn't get around them. I mean, if you're going to be
    vague, at least use words that sound cool together.  Lines like, ""An entire world
    waits/ In figures and lines/ For a graceless kind of lover,"" from ""She Asked Me
    Some Questions and I Answered Them,"" aren't very evocative.  And, ""But there its
    advantages end/ Before we had any time to send any pictures of our game faces,""
    from ""Don't Make Friends with Salad,"" is just plain clunky.  (Strangely enough, I
    like the song titles a lot, but they seem to have little relation to the lyrics
    of each song. And yes, the latter title is a ""Simpsons"" reference in case you're
    wondering.)</p><p>
    
    In effect, Check Engine has two lead singers-- one a little more lead
    than the other-- but they both sing with such over-the-top earnestness that it
    seems like they're trying to compensate for the plain bad lyrics (""But we really
    mean it!!!""). I'm sorry, but sheer force of will just isn't enough in this case.
    In the grand scheme of things, the lyrics and singing aren't as annoying on the
    same scale as, say, those of Enrique Iglesias, but they do heavily detract from
    an otherwise well conceived and executed collection of songs.</p></div>"|1411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1411-check-engine/|6.0|Jason Nickey

    get thrown at the wall of How to Describe Brando's Music. And while they stick
    for a second, in a moment they've begun to walk their way down to the floor like
    those creepy crawler 25¢ toys made from that hideous adhesive gummy-rubber stuff.
    In other words, they're close, but only useful insofar as Brando's sound is
    difficult to pin down. You can make do with the creepy crawler tags, but Brando's
    songs are a love-it-or-hate-it sonic Teflon that you owe it to yourself to hear.</p><p>
    It's remarkable that a band that sounds as warm and fully integrated as Brando,
    in reality, has its core members scattered over an almost silly geographical
    expanse. Some live in Indiana-- the band's originally from Bloomington-- a
    couple of them call Chicago home, and one is raising a family in Brazil.
    Derek Richey's voice does indeed recall Bowie's more nasally moments. And
    Brando's songs do often detour into odd glam byways that their more despondent
    ""recorded in my mom's basement"" songs leave you ill-prepared to process.</p><p>
    Which brings up another strange thing about the band from two continents: how
    album-like an album they've been able to put together out of so many disparate
    styles. <i>The Headless Horseman is a Preacher</i> opens with the title track,
    a short but pleasant electro-shoegazer introduction. ""The Fight Club Song""
    follows with its unnerving vocal and guitar melodies, wavering synth lines,
    and drumming that sounds only barely more human than the Casio beats from the
    previous track. Neither song is stellar, but together, they lay the
    mood-foundation, for what comes after ""The Seed"" is distinctly songwriterly
    indie-pop with a splinter-like melody and scratchy but brilliant guitar chords.</p><p>
    There's something-- and you may have guessed this by now-- weirdly, well,
    British about this band.  ""The Seed,"" in particular, sounds like a grotesque
    and yet beautiful mix between the songcraft of Death Cab's Ben Gibbard and the
    Pale Saints.  ""Theories of Division"" and ""Pilot of This Ship"" continue in much
    the same vein, the latter revealing Richey's Bowieisms a bit more obviously than
    before, and with more than an echo of post-Fab Four Lennon. ""Hold Me Mine"" shifts
    gears dramatically, with a sultry bass-driven feel that's sexy and slowly
    propulsive, until the spell is snapped by ""Leaving the Scene of the Crime"" with
    its Ringo snare rolls and ""Strawberry Fields"" background vocals.</p><p>
    The album slumps with ""When in Rome,"" ""The Leaving of Aytech"" and ""Overtime,""
    which bring out the glitter, platforms, and too-tight clothing, earning the band
    every unwanted Bowie comparison they ever got.  Yet, these tracks are mediated
    through an undeniably American prism of soporific indie pop musical sensibility.</p><p>
    The best thing that can be said about <i>The Headless Horseman is a Preacher</i>,
    other than that the first listens yield quite a few winners, is that repeated
    listens will reward the patient. Still, this is heavily moody, self-indulgent
    fare for wallowing in your own you-ness. Preferably with a succession of stiff
    drinks. Shelve the Spiders from Mars and your whole catalog of mid-to-late 90s
    fuzz-pop for a few days, and see if you can handle this strangely natural
    sounding hybrid of the two.</p></div>"|913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/913-the-headless-horseman-is-a-preacher/|7.5|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    beat the Sex Pistols to every punch in the late 70s, including being the first
    UK punk band to release an album.  They never quite sank in with the rest of the
    punk movement, though, and thus, the Pistols have gone on to be heralded as
    the leaders of a revolution, whilst the Damned have spent the last 25 or so
    years milling about on the sidelines.  Of course, the Damned never adhered to
    anything that could be called punk convention, instead preferring to let
    Vaudeville, goth and cartoonish melodrama to permeate their sound to the point
    where they became impossible to pigeonhole.</p><p>
    
    I won't lie to you: the Damned's new album isn't very good.  In fact, the Damned
    have only ever recorded a few albums that were-- for instance, their debut or
    1979's <i>Machine Gun Etiquette</i>.  The thing is, their new album is hard to
    recommend simply because the band is totally out of touch with what's gone on
    in the past few yeas in music.  Point of fact is that the Damned's albums have
    never corresponded to their time periods or felt truly prescient.  This I don't
    even necessarily consider bad-- it can be an asset in the right hands.</p><p>
    
    However, nothing could make up for just how annoying these songs are.  This album
    is stuffed full of little idiosyncrasies that quickly grate, and it's stuffed
    even fuller with some truly awful lyrics.  You get to hear about buying a new
    Playstation on ""Song.com,"" which from the title alone should be held suspect.
    ""I'm just killing some time/ It's a fantasy crime,"" they sing on ""Thrill Kill""
    in harmonies that wouldn't sound terribly out of place on a follow-up to ""Weird
    Al"" Yankovic's ""Nature Trail to Hell (In 3-D).""</p><p>
    
    The album is naturally also packed with questionable musical decisions, like the
    crummy faux-operatics that open ""Absinthe.""  ""Amen"" actually features some great
    backing harmonies and powerfully shifting chords over a strange bell arrangement
    in the chorus, but the guys can't stay focused long enough for it to develop into
    anything interesting.  Instead, vocalist Dave Vanian (one of two founding Damned
    appearing here) intones ridiculously over-the-top spoken word bits and irritating
    vocal affectations.</p><p>
    
    Likewise, the vibes and even some of the guitar work on ""The End of Time"" are
    great, but the chanting background vocals render the song a great deal more
    comical than it seems intended to be.  This is followed by ""Obscene,"" which
    features a chanted chorus of harmonized Vanian's warbling ""Obscene!  The
    Dream!"" and various other rhyming two-syllable words and phrases into an echo
    chamber (or more likely a reverb processor).</p><p>
    
    One of the oddest moves on the album, though, is the coda to the aforementioned
    ""Amen.""  The song fades back in with an instrumental passage featuring samples
    of the ocean, birds, and a woman saying, ""It's so simple.  It's fast, it's free,
    it's easy.""  Basically, it sounds like the band wanted to try their hand at
    modern electronica, but mistook it instead for new age with samples.  Regardless,
    it sounds out of place even on an album that delights in covering as much
    territory as possible.</p><p>
    
    Part of what surprised me about <i>Grave Disorder</i>, though, is just how good
    some of the music is in patches.  If you can ignore the rotten gothic dirge
    ""Beauty of the Beast"" that closes the record, you might find yourself having
    some fun listening to this disc.  Usually, there's at least one point in each
    song that grabs your attention and allows you to put aside the overarching
    goofiness for a few seconds.  For one thing, the band still has a lot of energy,
    and new keyboardist Monty Oxy Moron's vintage sounds bring a lot to the band as
    well.  The groove on opener ""Democracy"" is excellent, as is the underlying rhythm
    section on ""Thrill Kill.""</p><p>
    
    Of course, those two songs bookend the moronic ""Song.com,"" which features
    everything from lyrics about surfing the web to half-assed Ventures-style riffs
    and shouts of ""surf's up!""  The analogy of surfing and surfing the web is so
    played out it's painful, but it's pretty apparent that the band aren't taking
    themselves seriously.   Even so, novelty recordings don't have a long halflife,
    and by the second listen, the song grows extremely... well, bad.</p><p>
    
    Overall, this Damned album isn't so crappy it steams, but it's hardly anything
    that anyone outside of the band's most hardcore fanbase has to hear.  Part of the
    problem with reviewing a band like the Damned is that there are so few apt
    comparison points, and the band's history is so developed.  Therefore, I'm
    rating the album based basically on how much I liked it, which, obviously,
    wasn't a whole lot.  Ultimately, your time is probably better spent elsewhere.</p></div>"|2154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2154-grave-disorder/|3.8|Joe Tangari

    1.  Translation: ""I could not understand a damn word she was saying.""  Like most
    high school French teachers, I don't actually <i>speak</i> French.  Julie Doiron
    does, though. She began her career as bassist and singer for the well-regarded
    Canadian indie group Eric's Trip. Since the band split in 1996, Doiron has taken
    to releasing somber acoustic music, initially under the moniker Broken Girl,
    then later under her own name.  <i>Desormais</i> is her first Francophonic
    release.</p><p>
    
    2. Translation: ""Yngwie Malmsteen played no part in making this album.""  80s
    shred-master Yngwie Malmsteen could probably play 1,000 distinct guitar harmonics
    before you could pick your nose. Doiron would be lucky to play 1,000 notes before
    her next album is released this spring-- she has a reputation for minimalist,
    acoustic compositions.  On <i>Desormais</i>, the common denominator is sparse
    fingerpicking with little other accompaniment. The most captivating song on the
    album, ""Pour Toujours,"" begins this way, with Doiron gently but methodically
    plucking two-note intervals, sans back-up.  Subdued samples gradually begin to
    pulse underneath the guitar. Later, a drum march enters the foreground and raises
    the song to its dramatic peak. The musical interplay is tremendous, but sadly,
    it ends too prematurely. I will gripe about this; Doiron is exceptional at
    establishing mood, but less adept at driving home climax-- her song structures
    sometimes lack finality. In essence, I feel like there's more ""there"" there.</p><p>
    
    3.  Translation: ""Julie Doiron took voice lessons from the angel Gabriel."" Trite,
    I know, but it's true. Doiron's voice carries the album. Gentle and passionate,
    it forms the perfect complement to Doiron's minimalism. Without her expressive
    timbre, this would be above-average acoustic meditation. As is, however, it's
    enchanting. Furthermore, Doiron does a tasteful job adding harmony when the mood
    requires it, as on the fragile, compelling, ""Le Piano"" (which regrettably tails
    off just like ""Pour Toujours"").</p><p>
    
    4.  Translation: ""This is definitely better than Jordy (It's So Tough to Be a
    Baby)."" French toddler Jordy LeMoine was four years old when he scored the
    international hit single ""It's So Tough to Be a Baby."" This has nothing at all
    to do with Julie Doiron-- she's not even French. But Jordy is, and he was four
    when he achieved pop stardom. With a song about being a fucking baby. French
    people, man.</p><p>
    
    5.  Translation: ""I apologize if you are French and cannot understand my sarcasm.""
    I was feeling a little guilty for #4; sorry, Frenchfolks.  Let's be friends.
    ""Pour le future J'espere etre Francais!""</p><p>
    
    6.  Translation: ""Honestly, this album is gorgeous and captivating.""  Back to
    business: Julie Doiron has put together another beautiful album. It's neither
    groundbreaking nor incredible, but it's definitely one of those discs you'll be
    glad to own. Like for when you're in love with someone. Or when you just want to
    make someone think you're in love with them by adding a Doiron song to a mix tape.
    Or when you're on a couch and R Kelly just isn't cutting it for serious
    cuddle-time.  Julie Doiron gets these ""cuddling"" references a lot. They're
    indeed accurate, but I think her music is more flexible. It would also sound
    good watching lovers walking through the autumn leaves, or laying on your back
    thinking about your lover, or falling to sleep with your lover still busy reading
    a book, or eating brunch with your lover, or trading some Bob Carlisle-style
    butterfly kisses with your lover. Or, conversely, gentle sex. It's your call.</p></div>"|2406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2406-desormais/|8.0|Brad Haywood

Hearing ""Halah""
    for the first time as a teenager in 1990, I was immediately seduced by Sandoval's
    detached feminine voice and the ethereal psychedelic folk that shimmered
    underneath.  <i>She Hangs Brightly</i> and that waifish chanteuse were a perfect
    counterpoint to the masculine posturing of grunge.  I should also admit that I'd
    begun to grow tired of the formula before Mazzy Star dissolved.  Now, with
    Sandoval going solo but failing to veer from her same old signature sound,
    she seems less attractive than narcissistic.  Conceit usually seems to coincide
    with a lack of ideas, and when the wellspring of inspiration runs dry, there's
    only one thing to lapse into: self-parody.</p><p>
    
    Like all of Mazzy Star's releases, <i>Bavarian Fruit Bread</i> works well as a
    mood piece and makes good background music, but it doesn't reward close listening.
    Aside from a couple of tracks on the album, most of the songs here sound
    undeveloped and repetitive.  Considering most of them only employ a sparse
    accompaniment without a proper rhythm section, it's odd that, after breaking with
    David Roback, Sandoval has matched herself with My Bloody Valentine drummer Colm
    O'Ciosig who has only been playing guitar for two years.  This probably explains
    the simplicity of the arrangements.</p><p>
    
    One of the highlights of the album is ""Suzanne,"" a pretty little ballad with
    tinkling glockenspiel accompaniment and some nice harmonica lines.  Along with
    ""Drop"" and the half-realized ""Butterfly Morning,"" the first three tracks are a
    promising start, but from there things start to unravel.  With a catchy
    psychedelic soul vamp and a sultry vocal flowing like dripping honey, the fourth
    song, ""On the Low,"" sounds like Booker T in space, or Dusty Springfield on acid--
    it's seductive, but confused.  For most of the track's duration, Sandoval seems
    tentative about where it all should lead, falling back on the rhythm section to
    carry things to completion.  And most of <i>Bavarian Fruit Bread</i> is like this,
    the seeds of fine songs that frustratingly fail to completely deliver.</p><p>
    
    There are the two short keyboard pieces, ""Baby Let Me"" and ""Bavarian Fruit Bread,""
    that seem to make some kind of attempt at breaking new creative ground, but since
    they're little more than aimless noodling, they come off as extraneous interludes
    and add nothing to the course of the album.  The same can be said of ""Feeling the
    Gaze.""  The cello accompaniment is a gorgeous addition for a few notes, but no
    attempt is made to develop the basic six-and-five-note sequences that are strung
    together ad nauseam till you feel like busting the fucking thing against a wall.</p><p>
    
    But then comes another gorgeous success. ""Charlotte"" is another delicate ballad
    with Sandoval actually making an attempt at some form of emotional expression.
    For all of the beauty of Sandoval's voice, she makes little effort to deviate
    from her usual placid, monotone delivery.  There are few peaks or valleys, just
    syllables that slur or fade away, particularly on the non-acoustic tracks when
    she sounds either bored or stoned.  Sandoval's pouting on ""Around My Smile"" is
    laid on a little thick, and the slurred vocals make the already opaque lyrics
    even more so.</p><p>
    
    And when all is said and done, <i>Bavarian Fruit Bread</i> is just kind of boring.
    Sandoval doesn't add much to the Mazzy Star legacy she tries to perpetuate, and
    when she strays from that paradigm, she usually fails.  The fetish is dead.</p></div>"|6996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6996-bavarian-fruit-bread/|5.6|Nathan Rooney

Gira|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Young God']|2001-12-04 00:00:00|2001|2016-06-11 21:52:44.608691|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".z96x6daf4.1.6:0.1.0.$3455/=1$3455.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>A while ago I did this transcription of an Alan Licht interview where he talked
    about ""the old days"" and how New York City used to be dangerous, ugly, and full
    of vagrants, and therefore, also abound with strange and dark magic. In that
    city, so long over-run by snap-cap glamour kids with dad's Swiss bank account
    fueling their shoddy-art dreams, Michael Gira was a prince. His was mood
    unpredictable, his art was both serious and seriously disturbing, and it was
    either with extreme ecstasy or displeasure that audiences witnessed the
    violence, sound collage and glass-shattering vocals of his then-band Swans.</p><p>
    
    While touring with Sonic Youth in the mid-80s, Thurston Moore commented that
    Swans were louder and more abrasive than they could ever be-- that they rather
    scared Moore &amp; Co. and the rest of the audience.  But while Moore's ensemble
    produced a linear progression of art-rock through the 80s and 90s, Gira's band
    traveled less predictable paths (from an MCA-fronted cover of Joy Division's
    ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" to the ambient side project Skin, which also featured
    fellow Swan, Jarboe) before finally disbanding in 1997 for the pursuit of separate
    interests.</p><p>
    
    With the formation of Young God Records and the Angels of Light, Michael Gira's
    full-time, post-Swans musical project, a new era of the gloom-artist's career has
    come into view. Angels of Light have produced some of the most beautiful dark-folk
    on this side of the Atlantic, recalling more the manic stylings of Current 93 and
    Hood than the mid-90s phenomenon of depraved, unraveling folk on our shores (see
    Will Oldham, et al).</p><p>
    
    Unsurprising, then, that Gira is still largely viewed as a goth artist, a label
    that somehow relegates him to the Projekt ghetto even as bands like the Faint
    fall in the public eye as ""new wave"" while uttering the most shopping
    mall-friendly witticisms this side of Trent Reznor.  So it's a nice to see that
    <i>What We Did</i> comes labeled a ""pop"" album, with Dan Matz from Windsor for
    the Derby writing a majority of the lyrics and lending his Sam Prekop-inflected
    voice to Gira's two-chord symphonies. If it weren't for the trademark Young God
    packaging (digipack w/solid san-serif header and footer), it could easily pass
    for an early Drag City or Secretly Canadian release.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Packing the Locks"" hardly introduces so much as spills out the album with
    simple guitar lines and Matz's plaintive vocals withdrawing the jazz-turn
    affectations of Prekop and leaving the sensual breathiness. ""Is/Was"" takes up
    this slack, turning a borrowed blues melody (a la early Spiritualized) and
    stretching its pattern over long measures. Somewhere, the chorus ambiguously
    drifts in-- a trick employed often in the Gira camp-- as Matz's cigarette-torn
    vocals mesh with the back-up to form a series of drone lullabies. This reaches
    its peak on ""Sunflower,"" which mutates from oft-repeated chorus into chiming and
    scraping bliss-out in a way that mirrors the best moments of Songs: Ohia's
    <i>Ghost Tropic</i>.</p><p>
    
    The closing track, ""The Brightest Star,"" almost sounds like a contemplative
    Ladybug Transistor slow-jam, all analog warmth and sweet, soaring harmonies
    buried deep in the mix.  It's definitely pop-- and Matz's tendency to avoid
    emulating Gira's grim wails contributes to its accessibility-- but dirty pop
    (something N'Sync was never too convincing about).</p><p>
    
    The rewards of this record aren't reaped through immediate digestibility, but
    through repeated suggestion.  Still, this is by far the most palatable of Gira's
    growing mass of output and an indication of continued innovation in collaborating
    with those whose moods, ideas, and melodies augment his own dark brilliance.</p></div>"|3455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3455-what-we-did/|8.4|Daphne Carr

    Previously, Green Velvet had regaled the world with his tales of being a toothless
    inbred victim of alien abduction who lost his anal virginity at the hands of his
    alien captors (""Abduction""), as well as Zoloft fantasies about being an immortal
    water molecule (""Water Molecule""). He's also previously made public ""Answering
    Machine,"" a week's worth of answering machine messages during the course of which
    he's dumped by his fiancée who's also pregnant by some other guy, his landlord
    is throwing him out on the street for the racket he makes, and his best friend
    has stolen his primo stash. No small wonder Green Velvet rages after each message,
    ""I can't take this shit."" ""Answering Machine"" was later remixed to big-room-buckling
    glory by edgy house masters, X-Press 2.</p><p>
    For the follow-up to the 1999's <i>Constant Chaos</i> and the F-111 self-titled
    singles compilation, Green Velvet drops the chrome gleam of tech house and scoops
    up some filthy Teutonic electro-agit-punk. Never as distorted and slogan-slinging
    as Atari Teenage Riot, <i>Whatever</i> is assuredly aggro. Unlike the comfortably
    removed sci-fi of <i>Constant Chaos</i>, <i>Whatever</i> is altogether more
    down-to-earth and soiling. You don't have to be a skank to get off on this record,
    but if you are, it will assuredly assist your acclimatization to Green Velvet's
    funky ordure.</p><p>
    After declaring that he's a genetic defect on ""Genedefekt,"" ""La La Land"" returns
    to the wanton haunts of naughty girls and boys that Green Velvet exposed on his
    1995 debut single, ""Flash."" For his debut, Green Velvet took club kids' parents
    on guided tours of skeevy raves and encouraged the outraged, middle-aged delusionals
    to take photographs with the exhortation, ""Cameras ready! Prepare to Flash."" ""La
    La Land"" offers stern warnings about ""those little pills"" and the unreal ""thrills
    that they yield"" and the million brain cells that each pill kills. Underneath
    the manic preacher warnings, Green Velvet slides a demonic Euro electro track
    similar to the snarling crunky joints International Deejay Gigolos or Felix Da
    Housecat release.</p><p>
    On ""Stranj,"" Green Velvet flips into a more Giorgio Moroder-derived, tech-trance
    mode for his exposition on how strange his world is after drugs and how his
    family is pressuring him to be an upstanding member of society, rather than the
    night-filth freak he really is. ""Sleepwalking"" is an earnest and heavily
    processed tribute to Cabaret Voltaire's 1985 masterpiece of the same name.
    Though Green Velvet adds his unique lyrics, everyone whose adored Cabaret
    Voltaire's song will love the spindly four-note melody figure and the cowbell
    breakdown. Green Velvet reserves most of his rage for ""GAT (The Great American
    Tragedy),"" which he defines as people's willingness to be told what to do. Green
    Velvet screams, ""They say it's a phase/ This is not a fucking phase,"" over a
    sympathetically militant searing gabba rhythm.</p><p>
    Following the musical diary entry song, ""Waiting 4 the Day 2 End,"" in which Green
    Velvet informs us that he wanted grits with his salted scrambled eggs for
    breakfast that morning, ""Dank"" closes <i>Whatever</i> with Green Velvet
    portraying four reefer-jerks. Almost a cappella, ""Dank"" leaves the listener
    perplexed as to Green Velvet's no-narcotics sincerity. Since Green Velvet is a
    mask that musician Curtis Jones disguises his humanity in so that he can take
    long-stay excursions beyond the bizarre, no one should be surprised if they feel
    creeped out or sullied at the end of the album.</p></div>"|3571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3571-whatever/|7.0|Paul Cooper

    interesting music, too.  If only it were that simple.  Bands capable of carving
    out their own creative niche are either extremely rare or extremely elusive, and
    in a world where traditional values are juxtaposed against crass commercialization
    and challenged by advanced technologies, you'd expect to find plenty of cracks in
    the façade to exploit.  The Handsome Family doesn't seem to have any problems
    locating them, which leads me to believe that they either have an extremely keen
    sense of the ironies lurking behind our modern lifestyles and value systems, or
    that most other bands just don't care to create intelligent music.  I tend to
    believe the former.</p><p>
    Brett and Rennie Sparks play on the kitsch of a beer
    commercial-- round 'em up, Americana sentimentality that serves as a base for
    the exquisitely skewed ruminations that flow from Rennie's pen.  Tales of suicide,
    murder and madness float lazily over programmed Casio keyboard country-and-western
    rhythms.  It has the feel of a truck stop karaoke bar, or a ""Prairie Home Companion""
    broadcast from an old folks' home somewhere in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl.  The
    lyrics, though, are something altogether different.</p><p>
    The Handsomes usually concentrate on fashioning a mythological tableau of ordinary
    and forsaken characters, emphasizing the dark and brutal side of life in a way
    that recalls some of Nick Cave's work, but tempering it with a touch of humor
    that makes it all very unthreatening.  <i>Twilight</i> also succeeds where their
    previous album, <i>In the Air</i>, often failed, by crafting a set of slowly evolving
    tracks that act as perfect vehicles for the duo's brand of story telling.  Brett's
    delivery is slow and lumbersome, and soon enough, you find yourself easily
    wrapped into the tales these two tell.</p><p>
<i>Twilight</i> starts off in typical Handsome Family fashion with ""The Snow
    White Diner,"" the story of a woman who kills herself and her two children by
    driving into a frozen river, the singer watching the rescue crew and the
    gathering crowd from a diner as he eats his hash browns.  Death is present, too,
    represented by two old women sitting nearby, eating liver and onions (and my
    mother always tried to convince me liver was good for me).  You quickly get the
    idea with the Handsome Family that, despite the initial impression, you're not
    listening to ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds.""</p><p>
    ""Passenger Pigeons"" is a beautiful,
    heart-breaking chronicle of grief that has to be one of the strongest songs I've
    heard all year.  Rennie displays a lyrical gift I've found in very few songwriters
    and the artful economy of the words she uses here really disgusts me when I
    think of the millions Bernie Taupin's accumulated shoveling schlock while these
    two find themselves largely unrecognized (although I get a strange feeling they
    prefer it that way).</p><p>
    And of course, there are other fantastic songs on the album, too.  ""A Dark Eye""
    and ""Peace in the Valley Once Again"" are imaginative ventures into the past and
    future that create a romantic idealization of nature that reminds me of some of
    Neil Young's more imaginative tracks on <i>Rust Never Sleeps</i>.  ""A Dark Eye""
    is an Appalachian fantasy that takes you through the singer's thoughts as he
    sits in his car in a parking lot: ""In that parking lot where a prairie once grew/
    And through the tall grass the buffalo flew/ I heard something crying way down
    below/ Where sewer lines snake around Indian bones."" ""Peace in the Valley,""
    meanwhile, writes the epitaph of urban sprawl in a visionary account of the
    disintegration of a shopping mall and western civilization: ""All the mirrors
    cracked in half when wild horses galloped past/ And morning doves built their
    nests on the escalator steps/ And there was peace in the valley once again.""
    ""Gravity"" is the mystical story of the fantasies of a mad blind man whose
    potatoes speak to him.  ""The White Dog"" is a delusional account of nightmarish
    fear and paranoia.  Do you see a theme here?</p><p>
    There are some throwaway tracks on the album that I feel totally indifferent
    towards, and most of them are backed by Rennie's keyboard playing which at times
    leans toward campy.  But you've got to understand the Handsome Family.  Few other
    bands could give such a sympathetic catalog of deceased childhood pets as ""So
    Long"":  ""So long to my dog Snickers who ate Christmas tinsel/ So long to Mr.
    Whiskers who jumped out of a window/ And to the family of gerbils who chewed out
    of their cage/ And to the little brown rabbit I ran over by mistake/ So long, so
    long, I'll see you on the other side.""</p></div>"|3726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3726-twilight/|8.5|Nathan Rooney

    that in order to turn out an album of any merit whatsoever, an artist must be
    either twitchy, crazy, lonely, dejected, or just plain fucking miserable. These
    are the same people who'll quickly dismiss anything that isn't ""serious"" as being
    ""childish,"" ""amateurish,"" or simply ""stupid.""</p><p>
    
    It pretty much goes without saying that these people should be dragged from the
    corners in which they brood and brutally bludgeoned with tire irons. Granted,
    this is a rather extreme, not to mention labor-intensive, method of sorting out
    a few self-serious pricks. No, on second thought, I propose something new and
    different-- something to show all the quasi-intellectual gloom junkies out there
    that music can be really fun without being stupid or political or relevant. I
    propose that our sad little friends are dragged from the corners in which they
    brood, brutally bludgeoned with tire irons, <i>and then</i> given a copy of the
    now-defunct Prima Donnas' <i>Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques</i>.</p><p>
    
    The Prima Donnas, a convivial half-parody of a keyboard-driven new wave ensemble,
    fronted by Otto Matik (who also records under the similarly ludicrous pseudoname
    Gene Defcon), are certainly not out to choke you with intellectualism; the
    fourteen tracks on <i>Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques</i> are all about cheesy
    fun. But the three gentlemen in the band manage to make so many brilliant nods to
    the sleaziest, cheesiest elements of new wave that the album functions wonderfully
    both as a piece of catchy retro fetishism and as a hilarious exaggeration of an
    already-hilarious era.</p><p>
    
    There's a painstakingly elaborate story behind the Prima Donnas-- one that I won't
    bother getting into, but which involves English orphanages, Texan blues singers,
    and plenty of drug-induced comas. But the most immediately fripping facet of the
    Prima Donnas isn't their humor; it's their music. The first three tracks on
    here are energetic, mildly abrasive romps through the world of retro, synth-driven
    rock, with lead singer Otto's unique, nasal vocals cutting right through fuzzy
    keyboards.</p><p>
    
    With ""Headfull of Pills,"" the band truly hits their stride, turning out one of
    the single most memorable songs I've heard all year. With slinky synths, an
    almost intolerably great melody, and strikingly funny lyrics, the song manages
    to be every bit as good as any song to come out of the era the Prima Donnas are
    sending up.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere on the album, things get a bit sketchy, as the band seems to get too
    wrapped up in their gimmick to concentrate on making focused music. ""F.U.K.,""
    one of many songs on <i>Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques</i> to play up the fact that
    the Prima Donnas are ""British,"" borders on obnoxious.  But entertaining moments
    like the softly spoken vocal interlude on ""Lavender Shakedown"" manage to bring
    up an album that might otherwise suffer from getting too wrapped up in its own
    concept.</p><p>
    
    While some songwriting lapses prevent <i>Drugs, Sex, and Discotheques</i> from
    ever achieving actual greatness as an album, the consistent level of energy,
    humor, and fun (not to mention the inclusion of a single flat-out amazing song),
    makes this album immensely enjoyable. This album succeeds because, like the

You just can't quite keep track of him these days.  First he
    leaves Jeff Tweedy and the rest of Uncle Tupelo to their own devices and forms
    Son Volt.  And now he's abandoned Son Volt (for at least for a small spell) and
    has recorded an album entirely his own.  While he has denied on at least one
    occasion that Son Volt has split, <i>Sebastopol</i> does not include the note:
    ""Jay Farrar appears courtesy of Warner Bros. Records."" From that, we can conclude
    that, much like blood brothers Wilco, Son Volt and Jay Farrar are no longer
    related to the world-domineering Warner Bros. conglomerate.  But the fact that
    we have a solo record at all can be interpreted in a number of ways.</p><p>
    
    Did Jay Farrar get bored with the straight-ahead, twanged roots rock of Son Volt?
    Did he become jealous of Wilco's experiments and oddball collaborations? Whatever
    the case may be, <i>Sebastopol</i> finds Farrar seeking new musical outlets to
    rejuvenate his limping song formula. He looks to nonstandard guitar tunings,
    drenches of keyboard, and even takes up the Indian drone instrument the tambura,
    with varying degrees of success.</p><p>
    
    But as <i>Sebastopol</i> stands, it looks like Jay Farrar can't escape his past.
    At the base of this record is still Farrar's same slight drawl-tinged vocal style,
    backed by musical structures that haven't journeyed very far from the days of
    Uncle Tupelo.  Yet, <i>Sebastopol</i> is easily one of the more exciting things
    Jay Farrar has done.</p><p>
    
    Not to be upstaged by Jeff Tweedy's Jim O'Rourke collaboration, Farrar enlists
    Superchunk's Jon Wurster on drums and the Flaming Lips' Steven Drozd to cover
    everything from conventional keys to melodica (as well as backing vocals), who
    each appear on about a third of the record. ""Feel Free,"" the album's first track,
    opens with an organ line that collapses into a running drum track, fuzzy organ,
    and acoustic guitar. ""Turn off the nonprofit radio and let it all sink in,"" muses
    Farrar on the theme of living life to its fullest on a track whose production
    feels satisfyingly organic.  Drodze's string-emulating keyboard and monotone
    striking bell on ""Damaged Son"" turn what originated as a typical Farrar acoustic
    number about optimism into a quasi-orchestral extravagance.</p><p>
    
    Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, who once upon a time worked so well with Ryan
    Adams, appear on ""Barstow."" ""By the time we make it to Barstow/ We'll be more
    than half way to hell,"" laments Farrar, backed by Welch, over a tripping drum
    beat that transforms the standard country track into a standout. Rawlings'
    brooding lap steel resounds the cry of Welch's gorgeous coos in the bridge,
    rounding out a downright top-notch song that ranks among Farrar's best.</p><p>
    
    Still, <i>Sebastopol</i>'s 17 tracks and 50 minutes lack a consistency that
    would have made this record more notable. The three interludes are gratuitous,
    and two of these are downright annoying. ""Fortissimo Wah"" is 38 seconds of
    Farrar toying with a wah pedal on a single overdriven chord, while the 50
    seconds of ""Equilibrium"" are just a series of glissandos on an electric guitar
    in an open tuning with a slide. The third ""Prelude (Make It Alright),"" introduces
    the tambura accompanied by a filtered, driving drum beat that cuts off
    unexpectedly, which on first-listen left me anxious for more. ""Make It Alright,""
    coming three tracks after its prelude, reverts to classic acoustic Farrar,
    losing the filtered beat that emphasized the ride cymbal while keeping the
    drenches of tambura. When heard the second time on the full-length song, the
    tambura concept borders on sounding contrived.</p><p>
    
    The tambura returns for the album's closing track, ""Vitamins,"" this time much
    less prominently in the mix and more effectively against the song's marching
    drums. And after the album fades out, one's view of Jay Farrar isn't all that
    different that when it began: the songs are pretty much the same, but the means
    have been slightly appended.</p><p>
    
    While taking on an array of ornaments and guest musicians, <i>Sebastopol</i>'s
    production keeps the record as a whole on the ground and emotionally accessible.
    It's commendable that Jay Farrar is seeking ways in which to reinvigorate his
    music, but he hasn't completely reinvented himself. Not that he must; <i>Sebastopol</i>
    is an enjoyable record.  It just doesn't do much to change the popular conception
    that Farrar has his limits.</p></div>"|2998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2998-sebastapol/|7.7|Christopher F. Schiel

He hails from Los Angeles, and dabbles in
    a genre he calls ""avant hip-hop.""  ""Avant,"" in this context (as with most other
    indie usages of the word) is merely a euphemism.  One may use the word as a
    synonym for ""cutting edge,"" as its technical definition is ""culturally or
    stylistically advanced.""  But musically, ""avant"" has come to imply brazen
    abnormality over the years.  Dumb the music down and it just becomes plain
    weird.  So, in essence, Radioinactive makes ""weird hip-hop.""  Or maybe one
    would do better just to call it weird, and forget the hip-hop part.</p><p>
    
    But that wouldn't exactly be fair; if there's one thing I associate with hip-hop,
    it's the beats, and Radioinactive definitely has those.  His beats fit the
    ""avant"" label, avoiding pop, funk or fusion samples-- hard break beats, horn
    sections and thumping, subterranean basslines make but a few appearances on
    <i>Pyramidi</i>. Instead, Radio culls samples from the nocturnal subcultures of
    the world; the title track placed me in a Moroccan brothel (supposing brothels
    exist in Morocco), ""Una Cosa"" in a smoky Havana nightclub, ""Childish"" on the
    weekend streets of Kingston. The dominant motif is darkness-- not anger or
    aggression, but a relaxed, cool musical presence.  And as a contrast to most
    other hip-hop artists, I can't imagine hearing Radioinactive coming out of a
    Lincoln Navigator with deep dish rims, tinted windows and a dope ""system."" This
    stuff seems a little too exotic for the pimps and players.</p><p>
    
    The rhymes are another matter. Radio has an interesting free-flowing,
    halfway-to-helium delivery that sometimes matches his beats, but at others
    sounds superfluous and distracts from the groove. His rambling writing style
    just lacks precision.  It borders on free association, or some sort of partially
    calculated freestyle, and the loose approach, mixed with the tempo, results in
    enough words to fill a 20-page thesis. With so many lyrics, whatever message
    Radio wants to get across is severely diluted.</p><p>
    
    There's an adage that says the best bassists ""know how to play the rests."" MCs
    aren't much different. Two of the best examples for any MC to learn from are
    Rakim and Kool G Rap.  Like Radioinactive, each preferred to rap at quick tempos,
    but they excelled by knowing when to shut up and let the breaks take the
    foreground, or just resting on a beat to punctuate a lyric (""I can take a phrase
    that's rarely heard/ <i>[pause]</i>/ Flip it/ <i>[pause]</i>/ Now it's a daily
    word,"" from Rakim's ""Follow the Leader""). Radio doesn't play with dynamics
    enough, even when he's got a good beat to work with, like on the title track.
    Another example is the Arabian-flavored ""Before the Thought,"" where Radio gets
    stuck in a noticeable vocal cadence, which is odd, considering his rhymes and
    meter are rarely predictable.  Fortunately, the backing track overpowers the
    unrelenting lyrical assault, making the song enjoyable regardless of its
    difficulties.</p><p>
    
    Radioinactive is at his lyrical best on ""The Music,"" which is also one of the
    more traditional hip-hop tracks, and the one with the stiffest breakbeat. He
    sounds a lot like Del here, especially when he's varying his vocal inflection
    to deliver lyrics like, ""Down your sink/ Down your drain/ Found your brain
    underground/ With a plunger found right next to it/ Add some text to it/ Add
    some facts/ Ask your Dad for the keys and plan to never give them back."" Moments
    like these are not common enough on <i>Pyramidi</i>, and require patience to
    discover; the album spans 30 tracks and 71 minutes, including a good deal of
    random vignettes and minute-or-less musical interludes.</p><p>
    
    It's nice to hear hip-hop that doesn't conjure too many memories of A Tribe
    Called Quest, Gang Starr or Brand Nubian, as many underground artists do these
    days. But prescience and creativity give way to overkill and lack of execution
    on this one. If Radioinactive can clean up his act (maybe bury some of the waste
    in a Nevada mountainside or something), he has the potential to make some pretty
    wicked albums. This one might even be worth owning just for its distinctiveness.</p></div>"|6664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6664-pyramidi/|6.7|Brad Haywood

The tiny
    college town an hour east of Atlanta hosts a legion of musician-tinkerers eager
    to scrounge through junkyards and scrap-heaps looking for raw materials with
    which to build their elaborate noisemaking contraptions.</p><p>
    
    Empire State-- comprised of brothers Jay and Tim Nackashi, who are also in
    Beekeeper, and Alex McManus, a sideman with Vic Chesnutt, Lambchop, and Simon
    Joyner-- is one such group of Athenian junk junkies, specializing in refurbished
    vintage keyboards and bizarre (-looking and -sounding) percussion devices. But
    they don't stop there, just throwing together throwing a bunch of other people's
    refuse and calling it a day.  Instead, they actually write some pretty decent
    pop songs to go along with their mechanical inclinations, and for the most part,
    they successfully combine the two elements, and even throw in a healthy dose of
    electronics on top to keep things interesting.</p><p>
    
    Sure, sometimes the combination sounds overly forced, and Empire State comes off
    as a little schizophrenic, seemingly unable to decide whether to be an indie rock
    band or an electronic group. But after listening to the handful of outright
    successes on <i>Eternal Combustion</i>, Empire State's second full-length release,
    it's easy to understand the band's indecision.</p><p>
<i>Eternal Combustion</i> starts off with the instrumental ""Soaked,"" which weds
    the seemingly disparate sounds of Pink Floyd's ""Welcome to the Machine"" with
    your standard trombone-driven Souza march, forming into a album intro that's
    hard to resist. This leads into ""Explode,"" which chronicles just that:
    emotionally cutting loose and raging against a immanently bleak future (""It's
    okay and it's alright to explode"").  The song subtly hints at a theme that's
    spelled out in greater detail with ""Bugs in the System"" and the album's standout
    track, ""Bleeps and the Blips,"" namely the tension between Man and Machine. It's
    a theme that's underscored by the interplay between the electronic/mechanical
    aspects of the band and the more organic sounds played by traditional
    instruments.</p><p>
    
    ""Bleeps and the Blips"" is the closest thing to an anthem you get with <i>Eternal
    Combustion</i>, and, ironically, one the least electronically enhanced songs on
    the album.  On it, the band does their best Jayhawks impression without sounding
    too derivative, while McManus sings, ""All the seconds and sixths will make you
    crazy when your brain is squeezed like a sponge full of grease it's removing
    your memories.""</p><p>
    
    Later, with ""Don't Disturb Us,"" Empire State strongly recall one of the bands
    that made technological alienation their stock and trade: Devo. The first time
    I heard this song, I actually checked the liner notes to see if it was a cover
    of a Devo song with which I wasn't familiar. It's a catchy, fast-paced synth
    romp that brings the album to a peak before its finale, the languid Beach
    Boys-meets-Smog ballad, ""A Final Day.""</p><p>
    
    It'll be interesting to see what direction Empire State takes next-- whether
    they'll move toward strictly electronic territory or retreat back toward the
    kind of indie rock stuff they seem to have a mastery over already. Hopefully,
    they'll further deepen this middle road they've carved out, further blurring
    the seam between organic and electronic/mechanical, and keep digging around the
    back alleys of Athens for a hubcap that makes that specific sound they all hear
    in their heads.</p></div>"|2777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2777-eternal-combustion/|8.0|Jason Nickey

Well, I guess it could work.  Sure, why not?  After decades of
    settling for heavyweights and cash cows like Miles Davis and John Coltrane,
    it's about time someone stepped up and shattered the status quo!  Down with
    being force-fed, right?</p><p>
    
    Okay, maybe not, but it was a nice idea.  The thing is, I always sort of
    considered the great jazz commercial by default.  It's not as if Miles pandered
    to the masses just because he recorded for Columbia, and the fact that he was
    signed by such a corporate entity may say more about the state of art and
    commerce forty years ago than about anything else.  It's certainly not like that
    today.  Sure, there are major jazz artists signed to big contracts by bigger
    labels (think the Marsalis clan, or Joshua Redman), but I've often wondered how
    this comes to be.  From a label perspective, I can't imagine even the biggest
    names are bringing in too much capital, and that the biggest selling jazz (or
    some such) artists are people like Diana Krall and David Benoit says a lot.
    That's not a dis on D and D, but some rather depressing examples of what passes
    for jazz today among the greater record-buying public.  So, maybe that is a dis,
    against big labels, D, D, and the public at large.  Let me start over.</p><p>
    
    Indie jazz.  This is not a highfalutin' concept.  It basically boils down to the
    fact that big labels aren't willing to take a chance on music, no matter how
    artistically satisfying and/or creative, if it doesn't stand to make money. So,
    rather than sit at home, waiting for these labels to change their minds, many
    artists resort to releasing their own music, taking full responsibility for its
    distribution and production, as well as pocketing almost all of the money it
    does make.  John Zorn does it, Tim Berne does it, and Brian Allen and Jacob
    Koller do it.  <i>Brain Killer</i> is their first album, and it goes without
    saying that you're probably never going to hear this stuff from a major.</p><p>
    
    Brian Allen is a trombonist from Texas specializing in something similar to
    Zorn's postmodern take on jazz: that is, you'd be hard pressed to call it
    ""jazz,"" or anything else during a particular moment, but when you step back,
    dozens of genres become apparent.  His classical training comes through in
    the clear tone and precision with which he executes the heads on these
    relatively short tunes.  A sly pop influence comes through in his melodies,
    which owe as much to Cobain as they do Coltrane (though may have the most
    spiritual connection to Monk).  And of course, the avant-garde is written all
    over this recording-- just try getting through the angular strains of something
    like ""The Unwelcome"" without trying to find references to Bela Bartok and Zorn
    buried in his liner notes.</p><p>
    
    Pianist Koller seems to be coming at this music from a different angle.  Although
    he's no less a style chameleon, I hear a tad more cinematic schizophrenia in his
    playing than in Allen's.  What that means is that even though the two duet
    throughout the album, it often seems that a lot of the musical context is
    provided by Koller, as if he's creating the universe they exist in, and Allen
    is commenting, or perhaps just dancing around it.  Koller wrote about half the
    tunes on <i>Brain Killer</i>, and after even a few listens, his pieces seem much
    less rooted in Allen's pop experimentation and closer to something from a surreal
    soundtrack.  Idiosyncratic to say the least, and someone to watch out for in the
    future.</p><p>
    
    ""Machines of Industry,"" for example, features lots of themes and dynamic changes,
    which in turn produces the illusion of textural development, and yet seems to
    be describing a scene or single idea.  There are melodic phrases, but the piece
    doesn't seem so much a ""song"" as a tone poem.  And when the two players go off
    the beaten path for the mid-section improv (free, as far as I can tell), the
    descriptive agenda remains intact.  For me, one of the most impressive things
    about Koller's tunes is that, despite all manner of diversions and mood changes,
    the direction never seems to change.  And when they're over, I feel like I've
    just been told a short story.</p><p>
    
    I don't hear this kind of narrative in Allen's ""Bite,"" though there's no shortage
    of ideas.  Again, it's the cut-'em-up aesthetic of bands like Naked City and
    Bloodcount that I hear most here, and whatever it lacks in classical construction
    (which may be the real difference in these musicians' writing styles) it more
    than makes up for in fearless playing and kinetic energy.  The duo makes a
    complete turnaround with ""All the Rage,"" featuring a calm melody, but an eerie
    chord progression that makes it seem like paranoia is never far behind.  Koller
    takes a solo midway through, and it would be almost loungy in its relatively
    peaceful phrasing but for persistently discordant interjections.  Maurice Ravel
    meets Cecil Taylor?</p><p>
    
    The albums ends with ""D.O.P."" which pulls out a few of the tricks presented
    earlier, but with a lower intensity, fooling me into thinking they'll end on
    a down note.  Koller drops a seriously flighty note parade about five minutes
    in that leads to a furious coda wherein Allen doubles the piano's bass notes,
    and the effect is closer to Ruins or Don Caballero than any jazz I've heard.
    Afterwards, they launch a theme so rife with chaotic joy, I almost begin to
    wish they were a rock band so they could really hammer this stuff out.</p><p>
    
    Allen and Koller are relatively unknown today, though it's not for lack of
    touring and performing with other musicians.  I heard them in a club last
    month, and they're usually playing somewhere across the country.  First, I'd
    wish anyone with a free night to go out and catch their show, because music
    like this usually sounds better live than Memorexed.  Second, like most good
    music, the context is secondary to the artistry.  Concepts like inspiration
    and creativity bleed through scenes and genres-- ""indie"" or not, these guys
    are for real.</p></div>"|117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/117-brain-killer/|8.0|Dominique Leone

 right now, I'm the one who matters, because I own your ass. Okay, that was a bit
    strong, but you get my point. A jewel case and liner notes can go a long way.
</p><p>
 Band Composition: H. Female bassist, female drummer. And better yet, the ladies
    are not just a novelty to draw horny teenage fans (although we're not ruling that
    possibility out-- if I had some damn liner notes, maybe I could tell you
    conclusively).  One of these guys was also in an earlier incarnation of Black
    Rebel Motorcycle Club, whatever that's worth to you.
</p>
<p>
 Sound: S. The Stratford 4 alternates between pop (""All Mistakes Are Mine""),
    noise-pop (""Displacer,"" ""Hydroplane"") and just plain noise (""Window Open,"" ""All
    That Damage""). The label pays mouth homage to the band by comparing their pop
    tendencies to the Velvet Underground and Yo La Tengo.  For once, that's about
    right; it's all solid and well-executed, without sounding too much like either
    of the above. The noisier tunes include narcotic psychedelia, as on the bluesy
    ""Window Open,"" and more commonly, charged, ethereal guitars, like those that
    interject between verses on the lazy, sentimental indie-love number, ""Rebecca.""
</p>
<p>
 Songwriting: N. Great albums include one or two songs properly deemed Grade-A
    mix tape material. As far as I can tell,
 <i>
  The Revolt Against Tired Noises
 </i>
 has a few that come close (""Hydroplane"" is the best candidate), but none that
    quite reach the CD burner. In terms of pop, the songs could use a second-helping
    of catchiness, especially the melodies. The noisier numbers inch a little closer,
    especially ""Rebecca"" and ""All That Damage,"" but are not as gripping, affected or
    hypnotic as they probably could be.
</p>
<p>
 Fake British Accent: U. Assuming singer Chris Streng truly is from San Francisco,
    there is no need for this.
</p>
<p>
 Overall Performance: S.
 <i>
  The Revolt Against Tired Noises
 </i>
 is a pretty good
    album, and sounds like it would translate very well to a live show. With modest
    improvement and a little hard work, next time the Stratford 4 might be looking
    at an H. Have a fun summer.

What happens when your brand of fuzzed-out,
    retro garage rock catches major media attention? When similarly coifed Lou Reed
    fans are fitted for rotation on MTV? Are you awarded special regard for your
    prescience, or seen, erroneously or no, as cliché? Do you sink or swim?</p><p>
    The predominance of critically acclaimed retro rock bands this year is an
    undeniable advantage to comparative veterans like Seattle's Love as Laughter.
    The smirking suggestions of stadium rock and bluesy, Jagger-esque swagger on
    <i>Sea to Shining Sea</i> ensures some success in a scene increasingly
    predominated by bands shedding their 90s no-pretense shtick in favor of rock
    star posturing.</p><p>
    But <i>Sea to Shining Sea</i> is more than mere posturing.  Sam Jayne and
    company have turned out a kick-ass record that's rock and roll in every sense
    of rock and roll.  Produced by Unwound's Vern Rumsey and the ubiquitous Phil
    Ek, the record is a slick, skillful outing camouflaged in gritty, raw production.
    And Love as Laughter don't waste a second proving it.  The opening track, ""Coast
    to Coast,"" builds from an adrenalized Who-like intro into what may be either one
    of the best tour songs I've ever heard, or the theme song to a potential Love as
    Laughter TV series, wherein ""like every band on the run/ [they] fight for noise
    and some fun.""</p><p>
    In case you don't get the joke, sly allusions to classic rock mainstays are
    scattered throughout the album.  The guitars in the hyperkinetic ode to paradise
    lost, ""Temptation Island,"" wink at Led Zeppelin.  And ""Miss Direction,"" a bluesy
    <i>Let It Bleed</i>-inspired sing-along (and pun aside, among the album's best
    tracks), cleverly appropriates one of Paul Simon's most infamous lyrics.</p><p>
    Some of the better moments deviate from the winking allusions to classic rock
    history. ""Sam Jayne = Dead,"" reputedly inspired by apocryphal bathroom graffiti
    at Sam Jayne's day job, has a gritty, off the cuff quality, informed by
    comparatively spare instrumentation and Jayne's unsettled vocals. Similarly,
    ""E.H.,"" the album's 10\xBD minute-long closer, builds on a comparatively simple
    melody with some nice guitar work and fervent vocal delivery.</p><p>
    At its best, <i>Sea to Shining Sea</i> has a dusty, archival aspect; these are
    songs you'd expect to find hidden in some brilliant but forgotten rock and roll
    compendium, salvaged after twenty-five years of dust gathering from the backroom
    of an out of the way record store.  There are a couple of misses along the way--
    ""Drugachusetts,"" a psychedelic, Eastern-inspired jam, is ambitious, but it leans
    just a little too much toward kitsch, and ""French Heroin,"" a clumsy Sonic Youth
    impersonation, suffers as much from seeming essentially out of place on this
    album as it does from its general mediocrity-- but the accomplishment of the
    record as a whole largely cancels them out.</p><p>
    The trendmongers and poster boys of 2001 may pass without comment as the next
    phase of rock revival rears its ugly head.  That <i>Sea to Shining Sea</i>
    conforms to fad undermines its status as a great album, fashion be damned.</p></div>"|4878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4878-sea-to-shining-sea/|8.4|Alison Fields

Is emo the next big thing?</p><p>
    
    No?  Then I'm totally stumped.  How else can you explain so many excellent bands
    turning whiny all of a sudden?  First Death Cab for Cutie, now Pinback. I swear,
    if the new Flaming Lips album so much as mentions heartbreak, I'm going to shoot
    myself.</p><p>
    
    For the sake of total disclosure, I'll admit the following. There was a period of
    about six months when I was kind of into emo.  Back then, those off-kilter
    repetitious chords meant enough to me that it didn't matter that they never
    changed.  And something about the way the singers tried so for harmony but never
    quite made it hit me hard.  And then, somewhere along the line, I grew up.
    Ambition supplanted self-loathing, and with each passing day I had less of a
    place for emo.  I watched as, completely independent of my own musical evolution,
    the same thing happened to most of my friends.  The days of pumping the volume
    and getting all cathartic to the Get Up Kids were gone.  Nowadays when we hung
    out, we all kicked back in our La-Z-Boys, chillin' to Stan Getz and Joao
    Gilberto.</p><p>
    
    This would seem to reflect a natural tendency.  As one matures, so too does one's
    musical taste.  Emo has its merits, and I'll even maintain that bands like Sunny
    Day Real Estate and the Weakerthans do it well, managing to milk more out of a
    generic formula than they rightfully should.  But largely, emo remains cheap
    catharsis for teenaged middle-class white males-- the music snob's equivalent
    to rap-metal.</p><p>
    
    Which is why I can't claim to understand Pinback's <i>Blue Screen Life</i>. Their
    1998 self-titled debut was one of indie rock's finest hidden treasures. A
    collaboration between Three Mile Pilot's Armistead Burwell Smith IV (aka Zach)
    and Optiganally Yours/Thingy/Heavy Vegetable guy Rob Crow, it set lush guitar
    and synth to hip-hop beats, seamlessly incorporating scratched vinyl and a
    spattering of other sounds.  Each song was a patchwork of four or five hooks
    that traded off, repeating and varying almost like a fugue. The vocals were
    gentle, like Sam Prekop singing a lullaby, which often betrayed their twisted
    lyrical content (one song in particular-- with the nicest, most melodic lyrics
    about pushing babies down staircases ever set to music-- sticks out in my head
    to this day).  But on <i>Blue Screen Life</i>, the songwriting has devolved into
    straight-up formula, with most of the instrumentation that elevated the first
    missing as well.  And, oh yeah, it happens to be decidedly emo.</p><p>
    
    From the opening moments of ""Offline P.K.,"" you can tell something's wrong. The
    duo trades lyrical jabs, their disparate vocal parts sparring with each other
    in much the same way they did on their last record.  Only these vocals are
    uncharacteristically abrasive.  And in place of their usual musical intricacies
    are half-assed emo guitars which trade off between two riffs-- one jagged, one
    slightly less jagged, both boring-- for the duration of the song.</p><p>
    
    The next track, ""Concrete Seconds,"" offers some hope at first. The lyrics tread
    dangerously close to sap (""Late at station/ Feeling all wound up/ Got to walk
    several blocks past you""), but the delivery redeems them. The duo trades off,
    one doing rapid-fire vocals over simple but pleasant Rentals-esque synths; the
    other countering with a mantra: ""Anything I say to you is gonna come out wrong
    anyway."" It's a pleasant track, until it reaches its bridge. Here, the vocals
    kick into a dead-on Jim Adkins impersonation, as Zach and Crow trade off moaning
    meaningless dreck like, ""Here in my house/ In no seconds/ Count the footsteps/
    Count the seconds."" It ruins an otherwise good track, leaving a bitter taste in
    place of the pleasant melody that had dominated a minute earlier.</p><p>
    
    This happens a lot on <i>Blue Screen Life</i>.  ""X I Y,"" ""Prog,"" ""Tres"" and
    ""Your Sickness"" all have long, dragged-out, whiny vocals that sound a hell of a
    lot like Mr. Lucky Denver Mint. Not only is the sound unoriginal, but it also
    leaves me wondering: of all the people in our rich musical heritage that Zach
    and Crow could've ripped off, why the fuck would they choose Jimmy Eat World?</p><p>
    
    Sure, there are songs that come closer to the sound that first endeared me to
    Pinback. ""Penelope"" is pretty nice, with Kings of Convenience-style acoustic
    guitar, a warm bassline, handclap percussion that grows more synthesized as the
    song progresses, and plenty of lush ooh-ahh's to fill in any lingering empty
    spots. ""West"" breaks the auditory mold for a few minutes, featuring piano, organ
    and accordion. And the vocals are... well, they're less whiny then most of what's
    on this disc. But ""Penelope"" just isn't enough and ""West"" still sounds tossed-off
    and uninspired, regardless of the instrumentation.</p><p>
    
    The tendency is usually that bands, like listeners, grow out of the emo thing as
    they mature, but Pinback has got things all inverted.  Yes, the musicianship is
    competent and-- unlike most bands that attempt this stuff-- Zach and Crow can
    actually sing. The production is sharper than before, too. But none of this
    nullifies the real problem here. Emo or not, the fact is, <i>Blue Screen Life</i>
    is fucking boring. Nothing really stands out; no moment grabs my attention. All
    the songs sound alike. Frankly, I wouldn't recommend this to fans of Hey Mercedes
    any more than I would to those who run screaming at the first mention of the word
    Kinsella.</p><p>
    
    It seems sad to me that a perfectly good pop group would deliberately choose to
    emo-fy themselves, even though I concede that it's all just a matter of personal
    taste.  But even sadder is a perfectly good pop group putting out an album as
    boring and uninspired as <i>Blue Screen Life</i>.  Come on, guys, really.</p></div>"|6298.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6298-blue-screen-life/|5.4|David M. Pecoraro

Could any of the
    original rock and rollers have foreseen the kind of advances their music would
    be subject to?  It's not just that rock music sounds different now than when it
    began, but it seems the whole attitude of playing has changed.  I've always read
    about the old rock music being borne of rebellion, and the kind of thing that
    united otherwise unrelated kids.  But, after dozens of movements-- technological,
    conceptual and sometimes even cultural-- today, rock is almost irreparably
    diverse.</p><p>
    
    Now, most people would say that's a good thing.  I would agree with them, to the
    point that new music can never be bad, in the same way new information can never
    be bad.  Fresh ideas are the symptom of a vital community, and to witness the
    expansion of rock's reach over its history is indeed inspiring.  However, there
    is a price: chiefly, that when moving forward, often in direct opposition to
    that which is considered ""standard"" or ""traditional,"" sometimes good things get
    left behind.</p><p>
    
    I won't hide my biases.  I grew up on Beatles and Beach Boys.  Whether I like it
    or not, I've come to expect certain things about music, such as cool melodies,
    interesting arrangements, and ace musicianship.  This is not to say I don't
    appreciate inspired chaos, but unless I pick up on some inherent will to address
    (and not necessarily even emphasize) those ""classic"" characteristics, I'm wont
    to find the music lacking.  And this is why Volta Do Mar's latest, <i>At the
    Speed of Light of Day</i>, is often disappointing.  They aren't chaotic, and
    certainly aren't bad musicians, but something is missing.</p><p>
    
    Chicago's Volta Do Mar play post-rock.  Whatever your feeling for that terminology,
    it's now a perfectly legitimate generalization for music that might otherwise get
    lumped in with second-form prog.  This is music that takes all the dexterity and
    kinetic flash of old-school progressive rock, but is usually not as over-the-top,
    extroverted or showy (bands like Godspeed You Black Emperor, Mogwai and
    Explosions in the Sky are exceptions to the rule). Unfortunately, it's often not
    as interesting, either.  You see, my main issue with a band like Volta Do Mar is
    not that they're too intense and eclectic, but they aren't enough of those things.
    They don't have melodies.  The tunes are long and complicated; not because there
    are lots of ideas being presented, but as far as I can tell, because the band
    stretches out their ideas too much, and there always comes a point where I wonder
    why they keep playing the same stuff over and over.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there's a tradition for that, too.  In rock, you need look no further
    than the original Krautrockers to find examples of how lengthy, repetitive music
    could be both ""progressive"" and ""rock,"" and yet not be ""progressive rock.""  Maybe
    that's what Volta Do Mar is going for: some kind of synthesis of, say, Neu and
    Rush.  It just seems that when bands try to combine these disparate influences,
    they often end up creating music that negates the best qualities of all of it.</p><p>
    
    The album begins with ""The Sound of Day.""  Guitarist Phil Taylor finger-picks
    some rather lovely figures on acoustic guitar, which is a nice change from the
    ultra-processed sounds post-rock bands usually opt for.  Soon, an electric
    guitar enters with a repetitive figure, dissolving to tense jabs.  Pounding toms
    and a deep bass crescendo to a point when the band implodes.  Then, with the
    guitar still jabbing away in the distance, basses in both channels drop a few
    afterthoughts, and the acoustic guitar comes back.  The whole thing is very
    atmospheric, like watching an oncoming rainstorm.  A nice start.</p><p>
    
    Afterwards comes ""7/1000,"" which tries to up the intensity level-- the volume
    has increased and the tempo is faster.  Drummer Tony Ceraulo, excellent
    throughout, does his best to inject some life into the tune, which sounds mostly
    comprised of figures (but not ""riffs"") that are child to Robert Fripp and Adrian
    Belew's from <i>Discipline</i>-era King Crimson, but retain little of the
    direction of that music.  It leads into the short ""Rock for Nations,"" which adds
    some straightforward rock groove to the mix.  In each case, I could have used
    more prog and less post, as without real melodies, and lacking very much textural
    diversity, this stuff begins to get a tad monolithic.</p><p>
    
    The band does kick it into a higher gear elsewhere, on ""Binary Penetration,""
    which features some very aggressive drumming and guitar playing (though I
    still couldn't really call what Taylor is playing ""riffs"").  However, at only
    33 seconds in length, the fun is over before it really gets started.  More
    typical is the following tune, ""Quiet Alley and Lonely Terrain,"" which manages
    to take a hard groove and interesting form and not do anything with them.  I
    would like to say that the band are inventing a new kind of rock where none of
    the traditional characteristics matter anymore, but mostly I was just waiting
    for the introduction to be over, and the real song to start.  The introduction
    turned out to be the whole song, and I was left waiting.</p><p>
    
    I should mention that these guys (including duel bassists Mike Baldwin and Jeff
    Wojtysiak) all sound like excellent players.  Again, the fact that they seemingly
    have so much raw material to work with makes this album a little disappointing.
    Believe me, I would kill to hear people taking old prog and Krautrock, and
    turning it into a brand of music that wouldn't necessarily be ""post"" anything,
    but something new and just as interesting.  I'm guessing the members of Volta Do
    Mar listen to lots of great music.  Hopefully, they'll take their passion for
    playing and transcend the genres to make something altogether inspiring.  You
    never know, someone might compare tomorrow's rock to them.</p></div>"|8487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8487-at-the-speed-of-light-of-day/|6.0|Dominique Leone

The real problem
    arises when the old dog becomes so wrapped up in his new tricks that he forgets
    all the old ones. The miserable thing winds up spending so much time showing off
    its incredible new talent that it forgets to do the simple things-- like eat out
    of a bowl and not shit on the rug. Hopeless and frustrated, you find yourself
    with no choice but to take a rusty kitchen knife to Fido, ending both his misery
    and yours.</p><p>
    After hearing Papa M's <i>Sings</i> EP earlier this year, I couldn't shake the
    fear that I would at some point find myself cleaning David Pajo's diced innards
    off of my living room floor.  After spending years with sonic adventurers like
    Slint and Tortoise, and working with such unique voices as Will Oldham, Pajo
    happened upon the miraculous discovery that he can play dusty old folk music.
    Unfortunately, those old blues and country records seemed to have wiped clean
    all that Pajo had learned in his travels, leaving him sounding painfully
    amateurish for a guy who wanted to sound like a weathered wanderer. He was an
    old dog trying to learn an older trick, and I for one feared that it would be
    his last.</p><p>
    Thankfully, it appears that I won't be gutting David Pajo with a crowbar any
    time soon. <i>Whatever, Mortal</i> is a wonderful synthesis of Pajo's old and
    new tricks, and one of those rare albums that manages to be seriously steeped
    in tradition without being trite and boring.</p><p>
    In some ways, <i>Whatever, Mortal</i> picks up where <i>Sings</i> left off: with
    Pajo trying his hand at some roots music, and putting his uncertain baritone to
    good use.  But whereas <i>Sings</i> seemed little more than a genre exercise,
    <i>Whatever, Mortal</i> sees Pajo beginning to develop his own distinctive sound--
    a kind of slapped-together orchestral feel that lends the album a beautifully
    downcast grandiosity. With Pajo, Tara Jane O'Neil, and Will Oldham covering a
    variety of instruments, ranging from guitars and melodicas to wood floors and dog
    tags, <i>Whatever, Mortal</i> is a magnificently rich-sounding album.</p><p>
    Whereas lesser artists might get carried away with such vast instrumentation,
    Pajo keeps this album beautifully thin and airy.  Take, for example, the album's
    opener, ""Over Jordan,"" in which Pajo's voice is often accompanied by little more
    than guitar and banjo. The cold, dark tone of the song's verse is contrasted by
    its gorgeous ""I'm going hoooooome"" chorus, in which Pajo's multitracked voice
    seems to melt into something beautifully malleable.</p><p>
    What could have been the album's most sparse, revealing moment comes with ""Sorrow
    Reigns,"" a brief song in which Pajo is accompanied only by his acoustic guitar.
    But one of <i>Whatever, Mortal</i>'s strengths is that, while parts of it are
    deeply affecting, the album never takes itself seriously. And on ""Sorrow Reigns,""
    Pajo makes this abundantly clear, letting loose the Oldham-esque lyric, ""There
    was something like a wall between us/ That stopped your going down on my penis.""
    There's a serious tradeoff here-- the break in the album's somewhat-serious
    façade (which is already cracked by the album's title) is welcome, but the lyric
    sounds painfully out-of-place, and frankly, kind of dumb.</p><p>
    A better executed bit of goofing off comes with the album's next track, ""Krusty,""
    a lovely instrumental set over the backdrop of an episode of ""The Simpsons""
    (Episode #9F13, ""I Love Lisa,"" for those of you who still find the phrase ""worst
    episode ever"" amusing.)  Here, Pajo shows that, while he may be pursuing a
    folkier side, he still has some great guitar-based instrumental music in him.</p><p>
    ""Krusty"" is immediately followed up by <i>Whatever, Mortal</i>'s strongest track,
    ""The Lass of Roch Royal,"" in which Pajo manages to bring great sonic ingenuity
    to musical and lyrical themes that have been around for centuries. Using some
    wonderfully placed ethereal background vocals, a sample of rain, and what could
    either be keys or the aforementioned dog tags, Pajo constructs a sonic
    approximation of spooky sorrow that seems infinitely more substantial than just
    an acoustic guitar and voice.</p><p>
    So it seems that David Pajo hasn't lost his way after all. Quite the contrary,
    in fact; he's managed to produce his best album yet.  By not strictly adhering
    to the various molds of old-time folk, blues, and country, Pajo has captured the
    essence of the music he once shallowly emulated. What's more, he's managed to
    turn it into something that's unquestionably his own. Good Pajo.</p></div>"|6153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6153-whatever-mortal/|8.6|Matt LeMay

    it wouldn't surprise me at all to learn that Tim Burton employed Friends of Dean
    Martinez to write the soundtrack for some failed attempt at a spaghetti western.
    The songs seem destined for such a film, what with their ghostly translations of
    peremptorily Western themes.  And if the idea of owning something so unmistakably
    leftfield appeals to you, you'll probably love <i>In the Wire</i>. If not, then
    go spend your money on something less eclectic like the Strokes.</p><p>
    
    Okay, the Burton thing was a bad analogy but that doesn't change the quality of
    these four songs, available only on this limited edition release of two 45s. I
    don't know whether flipping the record after every track is supposed to make
    listening a more interactive experience or if it's just an unforeseen hassle
    that helped contribute to the medium's demise, but it actually helps the flow
    of the EP rather than hindering it. The more macabre pieces-- including the title
    number-- can be conveniently found on the first record, whereas the second
    features more formulaic country-inspired tunes. Such a contrast in style usually
    implies a lack of sonic direction, but one Friends of Dean Martinez's traits is
    the ability to infuse their characteristic sound with any genre that crosses
    their path.</p><p>
    
    The slide guitar still sounds like an amalgamation of Ennio Morricone and David
    Gilmour (circa <i>Meddle</i>), and the band still has an affinity for ethereal
    reverb.  Yet, there are definite signs of progress littered throughout this
    collection.  Such is the case with ""Main Theme,"" which features some of the most
    complex arrangements to ever grace a Friends release. Dave Lachance and Brad
    Fordham have evolved from an ample rhythm section backing the interwoven guitar
    play of Mike Semple and Bill Elm to versatile contributors responsible for some
    truly stellar dynamics.  Over the years, Elm and Semple seem to have made a few
    discoveries in their ever-constant pursuit of ""subtlety,"" a long, elusive
    attribute that, when achieved, greatly increases the effectiveness of their work.
    And periodically, the band relies on gentle flourishes of mellotron or organ
    rather than the typical slide guitar frenzy that's commonly found at the center
    of the group's efforts.</p><p>
    
    The songs are a little more raw this time around, though not drastically enough
    to estrange long-time fans.  Rather, Friends of Dean Martinez appear to be
    rationally developing the more experimental methods of sculpting noise they
    introduced on <i>Atardecer</i> while preserving the sound of a band playing live.
    On the EP's title cut, they succeed by adding tinges of psychedelia to their
    instrumental lamentations.  Elsewhere, on ""Wichita Lineman,"" the orchestration
    offers more diversity than on previous excursions. In this modern resurgence of
    instrumental bands tentatively titled ""post-rock,"" it's hard to retain an
    individual style while still flirting with new, unexampled recipes for
    songwriting. It's good to know that Friends of Dean Martinez are past the stage
    of dipping their toes in the water and are on their way to realizing their
    full potential.</p></div>"|3203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3203-in-the-wire-ep/|8.0|Kevin Adickes

Quirky, after many years of misuse and abuse, has
    become a dirty word, and an even dirtier songwriting approach.  And that's simply
    because, to be quirky today is to <i>try</i> to be quirky-- to desperately seek
    to be off-kilter and innovative, and often, to toe some quasi-philosophical
    aesthetic line, with the ultimate goal of making a lasting impression on the
    listener's  mind.  Unfortunately, quirk usually comes gloved so thick in irony
    and contrivance as to render its core components devoid of sincerity.</p><p>
    
    Which is why I will abstain from using the word again in this review. 20 Minute
    Loop is one of the more refreshing musical experiences I've had in months and
    months. <i>Decline of Day</i> practically begs for stupid music review fantasy
    hybrid-type descriptions. So here goes: say you've got XTC.  Now subtract the TC,
    and pair the remainder of John Doe and Exene Cervenka with J. Robbins in a
    six-by-six cell haunted by Frank Black's muse, with only a Radiohead CD, a
    Flannery O'Connor novel, and occasional visits from the members of Seely to
    break the psychosis.</p><p>
    
    This San Francisco quintet sounds like they should be from Georgia, not from
    the land of tech-sector meltdowns and hippie nostalgia shops. But then again,
    nothing much makes sense with 20 Minute Loop. And we don't have to travel far to
    prove the point.  ""Jubilation,"" the sinister carnival-pop opener, couples
    stomach-achy, saccharine sing-songiness with stomach-turning lyrical surrealism.
    It pays to quote at length: ""Bracketed diamonds, billowing smoke/ A terrible heft,
    behind that pitchfork/ A torn up napkin, uneaten meat/ A bloody steak knife,
    bunions cut off the feet/ A crippled Arab, face in the street/ Searching the
    asphalt for her missing teeth.""  Yuck to the lyrics, but yum to the unbelievable
    melody and the slick harmonizing of Kelly Atkins and Greg Giles.</p><p>
    
    ""Moses"" follows, parting the Red Sea of wack, uninspired indie-pop songwriting
    with beautiful melodic interplay that recalls the more playful moments of
    Burning Airlines, only enriched with a feminine presence that was always so
    sorely wanting in that band's macho compositions.  ""All Manner"" brings a solid
    pop hammer down on whatever reservations or resistance you might still be
    harboring. My favorite track, it uses mind-blowingly good harmonies and just
    plain pretty music to tell the creepy story of an unlucky couple's drive through
    the country. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, and the ill-fated lovers find
    their car interred in a snowdrift. As their minds and heart-rates slow to a still,
    they contemplate their icy preservation and lament the eventuality of their
    bodies being discovered ""later in the Spring thaw.""  Their dying wish: ""Let us
    stay like this forever, once and for all."" Don't roll your eyes, motherfucker.</p><p>
    
    ""Daughter's Down"" showcases Greg Giles' obvious affinity and talent for weird,
    chromatic vocal lines.  Again, a melody that's damned near impossible to dislodge
    from your consciousness is wrapped around grotesque subject matter: this time,
    an incestuous father-daughter relationship.  ""Pilot Light"" constitutes just
    another bomb-blast in the relentless melodic attack.  The musical break in the
    oddly timed chorus features a mind-bending keyboard melody, and the second
    ""chorus"" (which in no way resembles the first) has Kelly Atkins sounding like
    the B-52's Kate Pierson.</p><p>
    
    When, you ask, does it stop?  I mean, they have to foul things up eventually,
    right?  Well, no, not quite yet.  The album's title track, in a just universe,
    would be a pop-radio staple, and would buy these deserving characters financial
    security and mass adoration. But as W is wont to say, the world is full of
    iniquity, evil-doers and legions of poor dupes with shit taste.  Nevertheless,
    this track is pure gold. The lyrics are all Kelly Atkins, and are arguably, in
    their straightforwardly way, the album's best: ""I can lie here for hours while
    you breathe/ Indulging my doubts/ All the dreams that escape you come to me/ And
    burn themselves out/ I am hanging from threads that/ To the hands of the Fates/
    They have dressed me in a pale jealousy/ And left me to wait/ And in the morning
    we won't remember/ Why we're finessing a way of keeping each other down/ We'll
    stay up all night/ It's force of habit/ And that's not how it ought to be.""</p><p>
    
    ""Mechanical Angels"" is the album's last slice of perfection before sliding into
    merely ""good"" territory. It begins with lullaby-- soft-picked, guitar arpeggios
    that break into a chorus of inexplicable do-do-do's that out anything Frank Black
    has done in the past decade.  The album's remaining five tracks range from
    memorable (the dreamy, but dirge-like ""Elephant"") to just okay-but-not-so-memorable
    (the Dumbek-adorned ""Mompha Termina"").  Still, even if you were to cut out the
    final five, the first magically good seven tracks are worth as much as the last
    ten releases you thought were good combined.  It's been a while since I thought
    I could only do an album a disservice by trying to describe it. What else can I
    say?</p></div>"|8205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8205-decline-of-day/|8.5|Camilo Arturo Leslie

The Stooges records I've heard sound
    pretty good-- kind of a rougher, more driving version of what the Stones were
    doing in the early 70s-- and I like the highlights from his solo career. But I
    never felt the scrape of the edge Pop was said to possess. His mystique has
    always escaped me.</p><p>
    Like many aging legends from the classic rock era, Iggy has struggled to maintain
    his dignity while mixing it up in what is essentially a young man's game.
    1999's <i>Avenue B</i> was a detour that found Pop ditching the harder stuff in
    favor of a restrained and reflective approach, with some pretty damn spotty
    results. Reversing field, the more abrasive <i>Beat 'Em Up</i> is Iggy's attempt
    to put some cut back in his strut.  Well, looks like time for Plan C.</p><p>
    Record clubs like Columbia and BMG figure out which catalog to send you by asking
    you to indicate which kind of music you like when you submit your application.
    As I recall, one of the options is always ""Hard Rock."" The sound of <i>Beat 'Em
    Up</i> is quintessential ""Hard Rock,"" which means it lacks the stones to go for
    genuine heaviness, but is equally afraid to incorporate any hint of femininity.
    The result is an extremely bland middle ground perfect for cultivating Don
    Dokkens.</p><p>
    In the center of <i>Beat 'Em Up</i>'s tepid hard rock pudding is James Newell
    Osterberg, loudly complaining about everything under the sun. People in L.A.
    are licking ass.  The music industry is full of weasels.  Irony has displaced
    soul.  The title of the album's 13th track sums it up nicely: ""It's All Shit.""
    His cantankerous ways would be tolerable if Iggy had anything original or
    interesting to say, but he can manage only cliché.  The chorus of ""The Jerk""
    ascends with, ""His brain is full of dirt,"" and then comes back down with, ""That's
    why the guy's a jerk.""  The song ""Football"" finds Iggy using the gridiron as a
    metaphor for life: ""I'm a football, baby/ Going around the field/ I've been
    passed and fumbled."" Sacked for a 25-yard loss is more like it.</p><p>
    The melodies, the riffs, it's all third-rate bar band stuff.  But Iggy's
    curmudgeonly persona is the real turn-off on <i>Beat 'Em Up</i>. If Jack Lemmon
    had been able to hold on for a few more months, he could have teamed with Pop
    to make <i>Even Grumpier Old Men</i>.  To each his own, but I can't understand
    why anyone would want to worship the Walter Matthau of rock 'n' roll.</p></div>"|6408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6408-beat-em-up/|2.5|Mark Richard-San

    Japan's best-respected jazz guitarists. But it wasn't until his experiments with
    tabletop guitar led him down the seductive path of sonic experimentation that he
    became the stuff of legend. By the 1980s, Takayanagi had changed his song
    entirely, abandoning the comfort of structure for the cathartic joy of noise,
    his work paving the way for the likes of future innovators like Merzbow, K.K.
    Null and Bill Horith.</p><p>
    
    Given the nature of his most influential recordings, Takayanagi has never been
    high on the list for tribute album candidates. Then again, Weasel Walter, Fred
    Lonberg-Holm and Jim O'Rourke (who perform here under the names Necrodevourer,
    Sado-Immolator, and Lycanthrovampire, respectively) have never been the types to
    let trivialities like convention or reason stand in their way.</p><p>
    
    Paying tribute to noise music poses a lot of the same difficulties as writing
    about it. With no set of rules by which to play, how does one know if something
    is right or wrong, good or bad? Rather than attempting to recreate actual
    performances of Takayanagi (a move whose blasphemy would be akin to attempting
    to cover John Coltrane, every last note of each and every improvisation intact),
    Walter &amp; Co. use the tribute concept as a platform for original music, attempting
    to recreate the moods and feelings often catalyzed by Takayanagi's work. The goal
    here is not to emulate but to understand, and then to apply this understanding
    to the application of one's craft.</p><p>
    
    So if writing about music really is like dancing about architecture, does that
    mean that writing about noise music is like dancing about smoldering piles of
    rubble? <i>Tribute to Masayuki Takayanagi</i> is the sound of music crumbling
    apart, crashing to the ground, tearing itself apart from the inside.</p><p>
    
    The album opens
    with ""For Jojo/Freebasing Styrofoam,"" a 30+ minute-long improvisation recorded
    live at a small Chicago club in 1996. The first fifteen minutes are utterly
    relentless. O'Rourke borrows Kevin Drumm's tabletop guitar, using it to create
    layer upon layer of noise. Lonberg-Holm tears spastically at his cello like an
    epileptic at a Japanese cartoon convention. Walter wails on his drums the way
    you know he would on every Flying Luttenbachers record were he not held back by
    structure. The piece quiets down briefly around the 14-minute mark, as
    Lonberg-Holm presents a new theme for the group to tear to shreds. It slows down
    again two-thirds of the way through, allowing O'Rourke a solo, wherein he
    masterfully molds feedback in much the same way he might mold a melody on one of
    his more commercial albums. Walter and Longberg-Holm come back in slowly, adding
    to the noise, until the movement is back where it began.</p><p>
    
    It's a stunning piece of music (provided you can look past the near-absence of
    musical qualities), but always the perfectionist, Walter was not pleased. ""If
    anything,"" reads his well-thought-out liner notes, ""the performance came out
    more conventionally 'musical' and less 'extreme' than I think I originally had
    in mind.""</p><p>
    
    The tracks that follow were recorded four years later. The charmingly titled
    ""Endless Corridor of Roasted Babies"" and ""Give Me Head 'Til You're Dead"" serve
    as ""For Jojo: Take Two."" The guitars crackle and feed back, the drumming is
    spastic and angry, the cello is frenetic and high-pitched, the structure is
    minimal. To an ear other than Walter's, there isn't much-- aside from the
    crispness of a studio recording and a few switches in instrumentation-- to
    distinguish the new tracks from the old. But it's interesting to hear the group
    approach the same idea a few different times. It helps the listener to understand
    the music in much the same way that the recently unearthed reject tracks included
    on Blue Note's recent Van Gelder re-releases do.</p><p>
    
    Twice, however, the trio takes a slightly different direction. ""Slitted Tit""
    features Walter solo and sounds like a guitar self-destructing, while ""Triumph
    of Death,"" <i>Tribute</i>'s closing number, presents a vastly different sonic
    landscape: a long drone built from heavily filtered feedback that washes in an
    out like the sea. It's calming; almost unbearably so, given the chaos it follows.
    As one is lulled by the piece, one half-expects the tide of static to be
    interrupted at any moment by a barrage of screeching sonic noise. But it never
    comes. The trio rides out the album on these calm waves, proving that noise
    needn't always call for earplugs and gritted teeth.</p><p>
    
    So does <i>Tribute to Masayuki Takayanagi</i> live up to its name? That's
    debatable. The gruesome track titles and the over-the-top aliases suggest that
    these guys have taken their fair share of liberties with the work.  And given
    Walter's tendency for Kaufman-esque trickery and the relative obscurity of the
    figure at hand (not to mention the next-to-nonexistant nature of his recordings),
    I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the whole thing is a hoax. But does it
    even matter?  When it comes down to it, Walter and company have created an hour
    or so of exciting music (read: relentless noise).  And prank or not, it's just
    the sort of thing Takayanagi would have whole-heartedly approved of.</p></div>"|8578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8578-tribute-to-masayuki-takayanagi/|7.9|David M. Pecoraro

Bits of ska. Three chords. Sometimes melodic, sometimes not. That there is
    ten words, and they're almost all I have to say about Coquettish's seven-song,
    nine-minute <i>Total Pops Madness</i> EP. It's okay hardcore punk, nothing
    special. And yet, I must go on. So I'm just going to lay some random impressions
    on you. Forgive me if I jump around.</p><p>
    
    To their credit, Coquettish do write relatively catchy songs, with upstroke
    guitar surges perfect for pogoing, and 80s-inspired chorus hooks chanted by the
    entire band. The energy is there and is somewhat infectious, and you can feel
    yourself rooting for the band as the guitars sometimes struggle to keep up with
    the drums and vice-versa.</p><p>
    
    Still, I have to say that my favorite bits on <i>Total Pops Madness</i> are the
    brief introductions and interludes that are placed between the ""real"" songs. ""My
    Favorite Tune"" opens with a charming, melodic fuzzpop riff before the drummer
    decides he's had enough and kicks the tune into blistering hardcore mode. ""How
    Many Boys Do You See"" is 35-seconds long-- the first 26 of which are almost
    roots-style reggae.  That's the part I like. The final nine seconds I could live
    without.</p><p>
    
    It's funny: the first few times through <i>Total Pops Madness</i>, I'd resigned
    myself to not being able to understand a single word of the lyrics. ""Is this even
    English?"" I asked myself. I had kind of hoped I was listening to some overseas
    punk, but the lyrics sounded close to English somehow (if not quite there).
    Normally, I'm not overly concerned with lyrical content, but something about the
    intensity of the screaming made me think the words might be important. I listened
    closer but still couldn't make out nothing, so I just chalked it up to
    speed-fueled punk energy and left it at that. Later, I looked at the CD booklet
    and realized that Coquettish are a four-piece unit from Yokohama, Japan, who do
    indeed sing in English, but with poor diction. Mystery solved.</p><p>
    
    Listening to <i>Total Pops Madness</i>, I understood why <i>Punk Planet</i>'s
    reviews have been such a joke since Issue #1.  Could it be that there's just not
    much to say about most of the punk records released? When you're dealing with music
    created according to such a rigid formula (how ironic that a punk might describe
    chart pop as ""formulaic!""), spending words describing the smallest details that
    separate one record from the next seems futile. Better to pour one's energy into
    a 15,000-word Marxist rant about why Wal-Mart is so evil, despite the fact that
    the proletariat from coast to coast wants nothing more than to drip sweat on her
    endless linoleum floors. Um, actually, I've started to leave <i>Punk Planet</i>
    on the rack. Next to the punk rock.</p></div>"|1601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1601-total-pops-madness-ep/|4.2|Mark Richard-San

No, really.  I mean, the occasional free
    CDs are nice, and the exposure to hundreds of different artists is great, but
    there are times when putting the pen to the paper (figuratively speaking, anyway)
    is a real chore.  I find that it's hardest for me when I don't have much nice to
    say.  Believe it or not, not all critics relish the moment when they get to tear
    a band's latest album limb from limb.</p><p>
    
    For this review, I find myself in a particularly undesirable situation.  You see,
    I really like Sloan.  They're a great band.  Their last three albums were
    sparkling jewels in the power-pop coal mine of the 1990s.  The quartet rebounded
    from a botched deal with Geffen in the early 90s to become one of Canada's most
    popular bands, founding their own successful label in the process.  Of course,
    the political nature of the music business has kept their music criminally hidden
    from American ears, but that's beside the point right now.</p><p>
    
    I'm here to talk about Sloan's sixth album, <i>Pretty Together</i>. As the rating
    at the top of the page suggests, it's not a terrible album by any means, but
    I'm really not all that thrilled with it.  After 1999's amazing <i>Between the
    Bridges</i>, I was expecting nothing short of the best pop album of the year
    from these guys, and, suffice to say they haven't delivered it.  Perhaps that's
    not really fair, but I'll start actually talking about the album now by stating
    my biggest disappointment.</p><p>
    
    Sloan can rock.  I know they can, I've heard it.  So why is it that when they
    attempt to rock out on <i>Pretty Together</i> that they consistently fall flat?
    Three of the album's thirteen songs are big, riff-driven stompers that go
    absolutely nowhere-- the first time I've ever heard three clunkers on a Sloan
    album.  ""If It Feels Good Do it"" opens the album, declaring, ""This song is
    dedicated to you, because this song is for people who know what rock is about!""
    From that shaky ground, it proceeds to make a clever musical reference to
    Aerosmith's ""Back in the Saddle"" before launching into a vaguely familiar, fuzzy
    riff.  The chorus is catchy enough, but Brenndan McGuire's production suffers an
    unusual lapse, allowing the vocal break in the middle of the song to get terribly
    muddy.  From there, the song doesn't really go anywhere else, either, instead
    slowing to a sludgy ending.</p><p>
    
    The song's two hard-rocking counterparts, ""Never Seeing the Ground for the
    Sky"" and ""Pick It Up and Dial It"" are similarly muddled.  ""Pick It Up"" doesn't
    even have much of a melody, opting instead for awkward rock and roll posturing
    and dragging the labored riffing out well beyond the song's viable running time.
    ""Never Seeing the Ground"" stumbles along on pounding, disjointed blues riffs and
    also fails to deliver melodically.  After the first verse, the sing-speak just
    gets annoying.</p><p>
    
    The good news, of course, is that there are ten other songs on the album, and
    while a few of them aren't quite up to Sloan's usual standard, there are some
    especially impressive highlights.  One of the things I've always liked about
    Sloan is the fact that the band is comprised of four skilled songwriters who
    each possess a distinctive melodic voice.  Their democratic approach has always
    lent their albums an appealing eclecticism, and, though more of the songs on
    <i>Pretty Together</i> feel like collaborative efforts than before, each
    member still gets a chance to shine.</p><p>
    
    Jay Ferguson (he's the one with the fragile, high voice) pops up with the
    gorgeous, spare ""Are You Giving Me Back My Love?,"" a quiet acoustic song that
    conveys the frustration of not knowing where a relationship is going, and has
    a loungy, almost Hawaiian feel that recalls the Pernice Brothers' ""Cronulla
    Breakdown.""  Bassist Chris Murphy also takes a turn with quieter material on
    the excellent ""Life of a Working Girl,"" a reflective ballad about a woman
    taking a job like the ones most of us have: passable, but unfulfilling.</p><p>
    
    Usually, Sloan's albums are packed with potential singles, but this latest
    effort really only offers one real standout: the marvelous ""The Other Man.""
    The song takes the side of the third corner of a love triangle-- the one who
    proceeds despite the fact that he knows he's destroying a pre-existing
    relationship.  ""You know he's not the one for you/ But that's no fault of
    mine/ He knows I'm a friend of yours/ But he doesn't know I've crossed the
    line/ I know you've got a man in the picture/ But it hasn't stopped me yet/
    We've all been in one situation or the other we regret,"" goes the opening
    verse, before one of the band's trademark harmonies carries the sterling
    minor-key hook deep into your head.</p><p>
    
    Despite these and a handful of other moments, though, the overall feeling of
    the album is that it's, well, pretty together, but not as solid as it could
    be.  Sloan simply seem to be trying too hard on some of these tracks, instead
    of allowing their natural melodic gifts to take hold.  I still look forward to
    the band's future with high hopes, but for right now, the present isn't quite as
    bright as the past.</p></div>"|7246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7246-pretty-together/|6.6|Joe Tangari

    in his home state of Illinois he was mistaken for a bum off the street and promptly
    ordered to leave the premises.  School officials quickly learned their mistake
    and all sorts of ass-kissing inevitably ensued.  Sandburg, it is said, was
    gracious and extremely considerate through the whole thing.  Now whether this
    story is apocryphal or not I'm not sure, but it illustrates a couple of points:
    1) most of the time, style rules over substance, and 2) poets don't really seem
    to give a shit.</p><p>
    
    These days, style is everything, and since the introduction of
    MTV, the situation in the music business has only deteriorated further with each
    passing year.  I'm convinced that if Janis Joplin were born twenty-five years
    later, she'd be stuck working in a Waffle House somewhere off of I-75.  Of
    course, if you're a poet, none of that matters to you-- hardly anybody reads your
    stuff anyway, and if you also happen to be a musician on the side, well, either
    people like you or they don't.  At least that's the way Dave Berman seems to see
    things.</p><p>
    
    The Silver Jews have just released <i>Bright Flight</i>, the follow-up to 1998's
    great <i>American Water</i>.  Berman moved to Nashville to record <i>Bright
    Flight</i>, and the influence is apparent throughout the entire album.  He's
    absorbed the local country and alt-country scene, and integrated it with his own
    wry, lo-fi aesthetic to kick out ten new tracks of intelligent backwoods swagger.
    Stephen Malkmus doesn't appear on the album so the sense of comradery that gave
    <i>American Water</i> so much life isn't here, and consequently, <i>Bright Flight</i>
    sounds like more of a personal statement, mixing the cathartic grandeur of
    ""Tonight's the Night"" with the striking imagery of early modernist poetry.
    Berman is a writer, first and foremost, who happens to write music, but doesn't
    enjoy touring to promote it.  As a result, the Jews don't go out of their way to
    impress anyone.  It's this easy-going amiability combined with their frontman's
    erudition that makes them so affecting.</p><p>
    
    ""When God was young, he made the wind and the sun/ Since then, it's been a slow
    education,"" kicks off the album, and it's typical of the types of musings
    scattered through all of the Silver Jews' records.  ""Slow Education"" is loose,
    imbued with steel guitar and country rock wistfulness, and it also introduces
    Cassie Marrett as a doubling voice on the choruses, who graces Berman's
    deadpan delivery.  Sounding a little green, she also backs and sings a verse of
    ""Tennessee,"" serving the part of Nicolette Larson to Neil Young, or Emmylou
    Harris to Bob Dylan.  Much of the rest of the album continues in the same vein,
    only departing for the disappointing guitar romp ""Transylvania Blues"" (which can't
    match Malkmus' showpiece, ""Night Society,"" from the last album) and the boisterous
    ""Let's Not and Say We Did.""</p><p>
<i>Bright Flight</i> has some great moments, and two tracks in particular form
    the heart of the album.  ""I Remember Me,"" a black Edgar Lee Masters-style American
    vignette that manages to describe a young love born (""The moon was worn just
    slightly on the right, they slow danced so the needle wouldn't skip""), lost
    during a coma (""On the bank of the road 'neath the cottonwoods, he turned to her
    to ask if she'd marry him when a runaway truck hit him where he stood""), and
    finally remembered (""He bought a little land with the money from the settlement
    and even bought the truck that had hit him that day.  He touched the part where
    the metal was bent"").  Berman even throws in the striking line, ""A black hawk
    nailed to the sky/ And the tape hiss from the trees,"" to sweeten the deal.</p><p>
    
    ""Time Will Break the World,"" with its snarling, repeated refrain (""All my poor
    hungry children"") chills in a way a lesser band like Sixteen Horsepower could
    never pull off.  The song is filled with feverish feedback and apocalyptic
    visions: ""Tanning beds explode with rich women inside"" and ""The icicles are
    dripping like the whole house is weeping on an evil little car with gull-wing
    doors.  And I have no idea what drives you mister, but I've killed you in my
    mind so many times before.""  It's a powerful song that I played probably twenty
    times during the first two days I had the record.</p><p>
    
    Now that we Pavement fans can't look forward to any more of that band's albums,
    Silver Jews and Stephen Malkmus releases are the biggest events of the year.
    Here's to hoping we don't have to wait so long for the next revelation. But if
    Dave Berman prefers to concentrate on his poetry, I don't have much advice to
    offer except, if you do happen to have a high school named after you, for god's
    sake Dave, at least wear a tie when you visit.</p></div>"|7161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7161-bright-flight/|8.5|Nathan Rooney

Most of you probably don't need this reminder, but
    I thought I'd start out with an indisputable, self-evident statement of truth and
    then try to slightly undermine it.  As a believer, people sometimes assume I'm
    required by Biblical command to purchase, listen to, and enjoy the music made by
    Christian bands, but the truth is, I simply can't stand the vast majority of it.
    In fact, I'm offended by about half of it and embarrassed by most of the rest.
    It's usually oversimplified, condescending, full of pat answers and clichés, and
    just plain bad from an artistic standpoint (something that almost always happens
    when ""the message"" is isolated and raised above all other concerns).</p><p>
    But I live for the rare exceptions. Music that just happens to be made by people
    who are Christians, their art just an honest extension and reflection of who they
    are and where they are in life, and backed up by real emotion. Of course, music
    of this sort made by people of any faith (or lack thereof) puts a smile on my
    face just the same. Simply put, I like it if it's good, no matter who made it or
    what category it happens to falls into.</p><p>
    Up until a few years ago, I knew of few exceptions, and I had almost completely
    written off Christian music as phony, disingenuous crap. Then along came the
    Danielson Famile, a revelation. They were so far from the follow-the-latest-trend
    Christian band marketing scheme that I was used to that I was forced to create a
    distinction between ""Christian Music"" and good, artistic music made by Christian
    individuals. It seems like a no-brainer now, but at the time it was a big deal
    for me.</p><p>
    Now, a few years down road, main Famile-man Dan Smith runs a label of his own and
    has co-released (along with Asthmatic Kitty, the label run by sometimes Danielson
    Famile member Sufjan Stevens, and possibly the worst label name ever) this debut
    from the like-minded Half-Handed Cloud, a Knoxville-based one-man orchestra by
    the name of John Ringhofer.</p><p>
    To put it bluntly and a little crudely, <i>Learning About Your Scale</i> is some
    wack-ass shit. It's like an even more hyperactive Danielson, but with less
    reliance on metaphor and symbolism, (if Danielson is like Psalm 18, Half-Handed
    Cloud is closer to Psalm 117, if you get my meaning), less Beefheartian, more
    Elephant 6-ian. <i>Scale</i> also reminds me of the last couple of records by
    the Microphones, in the sense that, though anything could happen at any time,
    there's still a thread running through it all.</p><p>
<i>Learning About Your Scale</i> runs through 25 songs in just over 24 minutes
    and makes use of about as many instruments (courtesy of a few friends), so it
    comes off as a little fractured and disorienting.  But at the same time, it
    almost sounds like one extended piece of music. It all begins with a wide-eyed
    number called ""Worlds in Speech, Now in Reach"" which would surely be a future
    Jesus Freak classic if it stuck around a little bit longer. But the song soon
    disappears into the four-song mini-epic ""Those People We made? We Love 'Em!""
    which has got to be one of the strangest adaptations of the creation story ever.</p><p>
    At this point, less than four minutes into the album, one of its main shortcomings
    becomes pretty evident: Ringhofer's virtually non-existent attention span. The
    only problem is that this is also one of the album's strengths. The arrangements
    are lush, even orchestral at times, so it's not that things aren't fleshed out.
    You just wish you could enjoy them longer, or that the transitions would be
    smoother; Ringhofer gets bored with things pretty quickly, and shifts gears on a
    whim. But on the other hand, the album's jarring, fragmented feel is one of its
    more endearing qualities.</p><p>
    The remainder of the album runs similarly a-mile-a-minute. It's as if Ringhofer
    is going for a different kind of minimalism-- a baroque minimalism that compresses
    songs in time, but keeps them sonically vibrant and instrumentally busy. There
    are quite a few successful examples here-- songs like ""We Must Be Ploughed-Up""
    and ""Baby Moon,"" which feature a wide array of instruments and a lyrical
    completeness. Elsewhere, songs just seem interrupted midstream by the next track,
    and it can be annoying unless you're really paying attention. But, again, this
    hurriedness has its own aesthetic value. It offers the album a playfulness that
    wouldn't exist otherwise, and it reveals a trust in the listener that most
    Christian bands entirely lack.</p></div>"|3715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3715-learning-about-your-scale/|7.0|Jason Nickey

    all abuzz with comparisons, my heart torn between the city I know and love and
    the city I'd only just begun to discover-- the last thing I needed was to arrive
    back in Chicago to the news that Jim O'Rourke, one of the city's finest and most
    ubiquitous musicians was taking off for the Big Apple, leaving nothing but a
    string of bile-flavored words about the Windy City and its musicians in his wake.</p><p>
    
    And then along came the new album. From the very start, <i>Insignificance</i>
    comes across as yet another spit in the face, as O'Rourke's ever-steady voice
    intones the following: ""Don't believe a word I say/ Never thought you would
    anyway/ I may be insincere/ But it's all downhill from here."" Upon hearing this,
    I was furious. His initial comments-- which essentially left the city's music
    scene for long-dead-- were bad enough, but now he seemed to be asking me to
    ignore them, to write them off as, well, insignificant. What gall. This was
    where I drew the line.</p><p>
    
    Immediately I conjured an image of O'Rourke the Rock Star. It wasn't just the
    uncharacteristically loud electric guitar and wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am drums
    that burst from the speakers the moment I popped in <i>Insignificance</i> and
    pressed play. It was the lyrics. I've always had a tremendous amount of respect
    for O'Rourke the musician, no matter my feelings about O'Rourke the media figure,
    and I've always been thankful that the two have never crossed paths. But
    <i>Insignificance</i> crosses that line again and again. ""If I seem to you a bit
    remote/ You'll feel better if you call me a misanthrope/ Well, what ever floats
    your boat/ But as for me, I'd rather sink my own,"" he continues on the album
    opener, ""All Downhill From Here,"" just as the feedback gives way to calm vibes
    and piano. While O'Rourke's lyrics typically revel in playful ambiguity, these
    come across as a dreadfully obvious response to his own less-than-favorable
    image. Frankly, I hadn't the patience.</p><p>
    
    While generally less envelope-pushing then his more difficult-to-find work,
    O'Rourke's string of Drag City releases have always served as an opportunity to
    try on an assortment of masks. <i>Bad Timing</i> was the John Fahey tribute;
    <i>Eureka</i> the ode to the lost days of grand Bacharachian orchestration;
    <i>Halfway to a Threeway</i> a short but pleasant acoustic interlude; and now--
    judging from the opening moments of <i>Insignificance</i>-- we'd reached Jim
    O'Rourke's rock n' roll phase.</p><p>
    
    The lyrics on <i>Insignifigance</i> initially seemed to be those of a man
    overestimating his own importance, even as the album title suggests otherwise.
    Pleas to the public to ""get off my case"" may work for Thom Yorke, but Jim
    O'Rourke, talented as he might be, hardly carries the kind of cache for
    distressed-woe-is-me-rockstar-anthems. Maybe labeling the package <i>Insignificance</i>
    is intended as a signifier that O'Rourke is in on this joke. Maybe the title is
    intended to suggest that we've been taking the music, the lyrics, and the bold
    statements a bit too seriously. But, self-aware or not, lyrics like these come
    across as more than a bit self-indulgent, which makes the music, at times, that
    much more difficult to embrace.</p><p>
    
    Which is a shame, because <i>Insignificance</i> sounds good. Sure, the
    arrangements are simpler and more rock-based than any of his previous efforts,
    bearing a resemblance to his production work with Smog, but not to any of his
    own material.  Yet, again, O'Rourke proves himself to be an apt musical chameleon,
    every bit as adept at Elvis Costello-style rock songs as he is at more left-field
    arrangements. These may be pop songs, but they're hardly missing the signature
    O'Rourke touch-- they may start with over-amplified guitars, but they all give
    way to something else, be it harrowing steel-pedal and harmonica, or a long blast
    of feedback. And of course, a back-up band that includes Wilco's Jeff Tweedy on
    guitar and harmonica, Chicago Underground's Rob Mazurek on cornet and Ken
    Vandermark on saxophone doesn't hurt O'Rourke's cause any.</p><p>
    
    And so, the musical arrangements refusing to leave the confines of my brain, I
    got to thinking. Ever since the international shit hit the fan a few months back,
    I've been marching about telling all manner of people to try to understand your
    enemy's point of view before you label them as ""enemy."" So, rather than take the
    label ""hypocrite,"" I stepped back. I gave <i>Insignificance</i> another shot. And
    another. And after a while I realized that it isn't the smirking, well-calculated
    affront to me and my hometown that I'd originally thought it to be. Lurking
    behind these spiteful lyrics is an uncharacteristically human portrait of a man
    caught between his obligations to one city and the seemingly infinite
    possibilities offered by another. For the first time in my life, I felt like I
    could relate to Jim O'Rourke.</p><p>
    
    In its second half, <i>Insignificance</i> mellows out, suggesting a return to
    the relaxed vibe of <i>Halfway to a Threeway</i>. On the slow, acoustic number
    ""Good Times,"" O'Rourke sings, ""I'd like to raise the Titanic here/ Take a walk/
    Down its molded streets/ And feel right at home/ 'Cause the dead don't talk,""
    and the listener is left completely in the dark as to whether ""home"" refers to
    New York or Chicago.</p><p>
    
    On ""Therefore I Am,"" O'Rourke sings, ""Me, I've traveled 'round the world/ I've
    seen so many things/ Why'm I talking to you?"" His voice is as calm and collected
    as voices come, writing off the insult as a joke, but the music-- built around a
    simple but forceful repeated guitar riff-- betrays him, threatening to call him
    on his bluff at any moment.</p><p>
    
    Jim O'Rourke may not always be likable, but <i>Insignificance</i> makes him real.
    And ultimately, this is far more important. I may still be irked at O'Rourke, and
    I still feel the sting when I hear lines like, ""It's quite a gamble to speak out
    of place/ Those things'll kill ya/ And so could your face/ These things I say
    might seem kinda cruel/ So here's something from my heart to you/ Looking at you/
    Reminds me of looking at the sun/ And how the blind are so damned lucky."" But
    now that's all beyond the point. Jim and I don't agree on much, but <i>Insignificance</i>
    is catchy enough-- and real enough-- to make me look beyond all that.</p><p>
    
    So maybe in the end, the title <i>Insignificance</i> doesn't refer to O'Rourke's
    lyrics or to his boasts and claims. Instead, maybe it refers to a fragile man
    trying to fool himself into believing that uprooting himself after decades in
    one place is just that: insignificant. The result is a shockingly insightful and
    resonant look at the workings of a musician generally more given to hiding behind
    absurdly twisted turns of musical phrase than letting us in on the inner-workings
    of his mind.</p></div>"|6040.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6040-insignificance/|8.0|David M. Pecoraro

They're everywhere.  Malls, weddings, funerals, crowded train
    stations, amusement parks-- no matter where you are, some small child is throwing
    a fit for some reason you couldn't possibly fathom at your more advanced age.
    Babies tend to cry at or near the resonant frequency of our eardrums (440 hertz,
    give or take) so that they can be instantly heard over even the loudest din, and
    when that sound is isolated, it's one of the most grating noises you'll ever hear.
    It's designed by nature to be a horrible, piercing noise.</p><p>
    
    Keeping this in mind, I'm trying to determine why in the world Fugu's Mehdi
    Zannad decided to include the sounds of several crying babies in the untitled
    interlude (hereafter referred to as ""Track 13"") of his debut album.  Of all the
    sounds in the world, that one gets to me perhaps more than any other.  Screeching
    feedback?  Fine.  Microtonal sine waves?  Great, bring it on.  Crashing,
    dissonant orchestral crescendos?  A walk in the park.  But wailing infants?  No,
    that just won't do.  And the real rub of it is that this one lame little
    instrumental disrupts the flow of what's otherwise a rather pleasant pop album.</p><p>
    
    In fact, ignoring Track 13 by skipping it or simply programming it out of your
    player's sequence reveals an album of many delights-- some ornate, and some
    quite direct.  After an inconsequential orchestral introduction (also untitled),
    we're treated to what may be the best song on the whole album.  ""The Best of Us""
    (Zannad is French, but writes mostly in English) is a catchy, classic pop song
    that you'd swear was sung by a woman if the credits didn't state otherwise.
    Zannad indeed has a rather feminine falsetto, but for the most part, you can
    tell he's a guy.</p><p>
    
    This doesn't stop Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier from sounding more masculine than
    he does on ""Sol y Sombra,"" the album's only song sung in French.  It's worth
    noting that Fugu have accompanied Stereolab on several tours and that they're
    one of Tim Gane's favorite bands.  It's no surprise then that Fugu's own sound
    bears the marks of Stereolab even when Sadier isn't offering guest vocals.
    However, Fugu exhibit none of Gane &amp; Co.'s tendency toward experimentalism,
    gravitating instead toward a purer pop approach.</p><p>
    
    Zannad backs his tunes with gooey production that recalls the most polished
    efforts of the High Llamas or the Minders, and a huge arsenal of back-up
    players, including a ten-piece horn section, nine string players, two flautists
    and a clarinetist.  The overall result is full and satisfying, if a bit
    monochromatic.  ""Baragan"" makes the most of its extensive arrangement,
    surrounding the basic harpsichord rhythm with McCartney-ish bass fills and
    meaty, trombone-led horn charts.</p><p>
    
    You could check all kinds of influences from the Left Banke and Moody Blues
    to Todd Rundgren, the Beatles, and even Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, and they'd pretty
    much all be right.  But there's also a certain modern lounge chill to the record
    that's hard to come by outside of a certain core of artists.  Zannad packs a lot
    of melodies and countermelodies into 18 tracks on this disc, but virtually none
    of them are delivered with any particular sense of urgency.  Rather, the
    musicians involved seem quite content to invite you into a relaxed state.</p><p>
    
    Several of the instrumental interludes on the album shine just as brightly as
    the proper songs.  ""Angel Fair with Golden Hair"" recalls the instrumentals from
    <i>Pet Sounds</i> with syrupy orchestration and simple, clean guitar hooks.
    ""Tsimbalon"" is all Bacharach, with a mellow trombone melody and spare percussion.
    Of course, Track 13 soon destroys the calm ""Tsimbalon"" induces, and it's time
    for the skip button.</p><p>
    
    All in all, <i>Fugu 1</i> is a fairly nice little slab of French Anglo-pop, and
    pleasant reading accompaniment if you can reach the skip button from where you're
    sitting.  Still, all the baroque orchestral flourishes in the world can't save
    it from ultimately feeling fairly flat and unidimensional when you listen hard
    enough.  Only two or three songs really stand apart from the bunch well enough
    to grab your attention, and they're gone fairly quickly.  If your collection is
    already loaded with a bit too much pop in debt to the three big B's of the 60s
    (Beatles, Beach Boys, Bacharach), you probably don't need to buy this album.
    But if you do happen to purchase it, chances are good that it won't have you
    crying.</p></div>"|3244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3244-fugu-1/|6.4|Joe Tangari

    my life to Noah Baumbach's film <i>Kicking and Screaming</i>. For those who've
    seen it, maybe you'll understand. For those who haven't, bear with me. It's a
    dialogue-driven piece of celluloid populated by a bunch of post-college-grads
    who spend their time quizzing each other about films in which monkeys have a
    starring role, calling themselves the Cougars (or is it the Hawks?) and obsessing
    over trivial things like crossword puzzles, phone messages and a ""cookie man.""</p><p>
    Okay, so that's a bit of oversimplification. The basic gist is that these four
    guys are trying to figure out what the hell they're going to do with their lives,
    but for the most part, they're too afraid to actually do anything about it.
    Cliché, right?  Probably.  And what does this have to do with Aereogramme, anyway?
    Well, see, there's this morose bastard in the film named Max who fixates on the
    tiniest things, obsessing over them to the point of social paralysis. At one
    point, he admits to a feeling of nostalgia for just about everything, claiming
    that he's nostalgic for events that are happening at that moment, and often for
    events that haven't even occurred. And nostalgia is exactly the state of mind I
    find myself in right now listening to Aereogramme's <i>A Story in White</i>. I
    doubt it's the reaction the band was looking for when they recorded this album,
    but once I heard the disc and read they were from Scotland, it was too late.</p><p>
    So where does this yearning for the past originate? Mid-90s Glasgow. First it
    was Mogwai. Or was it Belle and Sebastian? I can't remember. Seems to me it was
    all around the same time anyway. Those late winter days of 1996 and the early
    months of 1997. It all happened so fast. Two Glaswegian bands flip-flopped a
    little corner of the music world (or at least mine) and, within a few months,
    indie scenesters were dropping their names at every opportunity. There have been
    other bands coming out of that Scottish town since-- markedly Arab Strap and the
    little-heard Ganger-- but nowadays people hear ""Glasgow"" and some of the names
    jumping immediately to mind are Belle and Sebastian or Mogwai. I'm no exception.
    Though, if this disc in any indication, people might soon add Aereogramme to that
    list of Glaswegian notables.</p><p>
    Rising from the ashes of Ganger (singer/guitarist Craig B's former band),
    Aereogramme has been around since '99. Releasing a couple of now out-of-print
    singles, the lads finally found a home on the Chemikal Underground label (also
    home to Mogwai) and set up camp in a studio for a few months. A couple of EPs
    later, plus <i>A Story in White</i>, and these guys are approaching full sonic
    bloom. Spanning 13 tracks, the Matador issue of this album contains the full UK
    version, plus the entire <i>White Paw</i> EP. Capable of constructing quiet,
    beautiful melodies one minute and transforming into snarling tension-filled
    guitar fury the next, Aereogramme is sure to draw comparisons to Mogwai--
    inaccurate though they may be.</p><p>
<i>A Story in White</i> has Aereogramme trying its hand in a number of different
    arenas: angular math-rhythmic guitar on the opener ""The Question is Complete,""
    the lo-fi muted beauty of ""Egypt,"" the driven catharsis of ""Zionist Timing"" or
    the beautiful, string-laden ""Sunday 3:52"" that places them squarely in the
    Rachel's territory. Their tendency to hurdle genre boundaries and bound headfirst
    into different spaces is alarming at times. For an example, witness the transition
    from the sweeping, lustrous beauty of ""Sunday 3:52"" into the primal scream
    therapy of ""Screaming for Joey."" Dividing the album in two halves, ""Screaming
    for Joey"" captures Aereogramme in full bombardment gear, pummeling their
    instruments with Craig B shredding vocal cords amid the blare.</p><p>
    In contrast, though, the standout moments on <i>A Story in White</i> are reserved
    for quieter melodies. ""A Meaningful Existence"" might just be the finest thing
    these guys have committed to tape. Beginning with just Craig B crooning atop
    quiet piano and some gurgling electronics in the background, it soon shifts into
    full-on Dave-Fridmann-style percussion boom. Pushing forward with driving rhythm,
    and propelled by drum fills and a muscular guitar solo, it's bliss-inducing
    moments like this that make the album so delightful. Electronically treating the
    instruments on many of the tracks, the distant thuds on ""Post-Tour, Pre-Judgement""
    echoes dub territory before the song blossoms into a wash of multi-textured wash
    of guitar, vocals and electronics. The lyrics on the album rarely seem to be a
    focal point, but Craig B's vocals are rarely obtrusive (unless he's in full
    screech mode). And while his ability to shift pitches from quiet whisper or
    gentle hum to abrasive yowls is nowhere near that of the uncanny Mike Patton,
    it's an often mesmerizing thing.</p><p>
    The broken-hearted ""Will You Still Find Me?"" is a mournful, lonely dirge with B
    sorrowfully chanting, ""If I am alone will you still find me,"" before fading into
    an electronic murmur. The album closes with three bonus tracks (""Motion,""
    ""Messenger"" and ""The Art of Belief"" from the <i>White Paw</i> EP), all of which
    blend undetectably into the unfolding spheres of <i>A Story in White</i>.</p><p>
    So has Glasgow done it again? Is Aereogramme the next indie household name? I
    don't know, but listening to this album repeatedly for a couple of weeks, I'm
    envisioning myself just like Max: nostalgic for this moment before it's even
    passed, and positioning myself in the future so I can look back and think,
    ""Remember when that Aereogramme album came out? The leaves were falling. It was
    cold and the heaters wouldn't work...""</p></div>"|62.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/62-a-story-in-white/|8.2|Luke Buckman

    bastard"" music.  Thankfully, by the same virtue, it's ""damn beautiful,"" too.  As

    alt-rock Westerns and folky East Coast Americana.  Now, after years of playing
    with that band, Alverson is also recording music from his home in Richmond,

    Graduates</i>, and visited Maine to record American poet Robert Creeley reading
    his works for the first issue in the Jagjaguwar Correspondent series.</p><p>
    
    Alverson might not share Creeley's confessional style, but a listen to both shows
    the transformative power of their emphatic delivery.  Alverson's voice, warm and
    rich, yet wavering delicately, is accompanied on most songs by the other main
    Spokanester, Courtney Bowles.  Sometimes she coos in harmony with him, and other
    times she echoes just a measure later, adding a sweet tone to complement his
    lower pitch.  Together, they're metamorphic: ""Your room just isn't the same""
    might be a dull statement for most, but from their throats, the chorus of the
    album's title track becomes a lament so melancholy that your own room might seem
    like that of a stranger's.  The fading fall season seems to be trapped perfectly
    in the soft acoustic strums and sparse drums on this opening song.</p><p>
    
    ""The Absentee"" continues with a greater sense of urgency.  Alverson draws out
    each syllable in the verse (""Row my body home/ And stow my heart below"") until
    his weary refrain seems like wind brushing across the pane.  The drums and
    guitar patter repetitively, their circular motif soon reprised by violinist Karl
    Runge.  They reach the chorus, and Bowles' sing-song tempo, thankfully just shy
    of twee, brings a perverse cheer to the lines, ""I stayed up late sitting by the
    TV/ The happy faces spoiled my evening.""  As you listen, you get a sense of
    Spokane's poetics, a strange combination of domesticity and distance.  ""American
    Television"" answers ""The Absentee"" with an intricate embroidery of glockenspiel,
    violin and electric guitar.  As Alverson vaguely describes, ""My dear wife/ There
    in the kitchen/ I can almost hear her stir,"" the swooning instruments say all
    that he won't bring to words.</p><p>
    
    We can forgive Spokane for ""Other Rooms.""  Someone should have told them that
    sampling the sounds of children and playgrounds has been done and done again,
    from Floyd to Boards of Canada to Rosewater Elizabeth.  A move like this can
    mean Sudden Infant Death Syndrome for an album, but the poignant, chiming
    guitars that rise at the conclusion of this instrumental make it too damn
    pleasant to deride.  Much of <i>The Proud Graduates</i> passes this way, in a
    smooth, unsurprising succession, yet the emotion in Alverson's honeyed rasp and
    the detail in every heartfelt chord keeps you hanging on.  The persistent violin
    of ""Disappointed Athlete,"" in particular, recalls the sublime slowcore of Low's
    <i>The Curtain Hits the Cast</i>.</p><p>
    
    Spokane come closest to breaking out of the subdued melancholy on ""The Workweek,""
    as Alverson's voice rises higher, singing, ""The workweek will end (They told me
    so)/ And there will be another comfortable chair.../ But the stairs will creak/
    And the dead wait in the street.""  Of course, considering the characters, from
    the proud graduates to the athlete, one might make accusations of a certain
    bourgeois, ivy-league sense of sorrow.  But that seems to be the point: sadness
    illustrated in the dull patterns of life, both lyrically and in the cycle of
    verse to chorus and back to verse.  The heart never quite breaks in the tales
    Spokane tell; it clenches and then lives on.  And if these simple tragedies are
    repetitive and maudlin in any way, they're like an orgasm: you keep coming back
    for the little domestic deaths.</p></div>"|7423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7423-the-proud-graduates/|7.9|Christopher Dare

The images that first spring to mind aren't very pleasant:
    London's Burning, Anarchy in the UK, social upheaval and discontent, inflation,
    pollution... wide collars.  Far from the seething boil of the city however was
    the Welsh countryside with its sea cliffs, Norman castles and gently rolling
    hills.  Here, respectable gentlemen had respectable children who would learn
    about Pooh Corner before being hustled off to bed, the father settling down in
    his recliner with a pipe, a spot of fine brandy and a good book (preferably <i>A
    Shropshire Lad</i>).  Excuse the hyperbole, but with each succeeding album
    Gorky's Zygotic Mynci release they retreat further from their skittish early
    style, and over the years, they've gradually settled into a well-crafted
    folk/pop whose tranquility must be the influence of an idyllic past.</p><p>
    
    It's apparent that, as little Zygotes, the Gorky's didn't have Johnny Rotten or
    the Clash blaring into their cribs, and that punks with pink mohawks were as rare
    and fantastic as unicorns.  <i>How I Long to Feel That Summer in My Heart</i> is
    a testament to the influences of their youth; echoes of Lennon and McCartney,
    Simon and Garfunkel, Nick Drake, and Fairport Convention glide through the album
    before tiptoeing into a corner and reappearing a few tracks later.  Think of
    ""Long, Long, Long,"" ""Scarborough Fair,"" and ""Pink Moon."" You detect as much of a
    hint of angst in this music as a fart in the wind.  While hints of this pure
    melodic sense were evident on their earlier albums, more often than not the
    emphasis was on the eccentric or even the bizarre.</p><p>
    
    Gorky has always enjoyed surprising or puzzling the listener, creating albums as
    varied and unpredictable as a Hieronymous Bosch canvas; they often sing in Welsh,
    and shift tempo, volume and instruments unexpectedly.  On this outing however,
    all of the tracks are sung in English at an even, gentle tempo, and you're only
    taken by surprise when you consider the beauty of the arrangements, all of which
    are understated, with Euros Child's voice rarely rising above a whisper.  GZM
    still incorporate an array of instruments into their songs, but here they
    complement the mood of the album well and add a subtle shading which prevents
    the set from ever tiring the listener.</p><p>
    
    Lennon and McCartney allusions are there from the start.  The first track on the
    album, ""Where Does Yer Go Now,"" starts off with an intro reminiscent of <i>Mind
    Games</i>.  Before the track ends, though, you feel like you've just rummaged
    through the local music store.  And the number of instruments the band manages
    to mix into a four-minute single is even more impressive when you consider how
    effortless it all sounds.  It's a testament to the amount of care that's been
    put into these tracks.  I often found myself listening intently just trying to
    filter out and categorize all of the detail.  Considering that the main band
    members are credited with playing no less than 25 different instruments (and
    that doesn't include the string section or brass band), it's easy to get an idea
    of the amount of organization required to pull it all together.  The Fab
    Four-modulated harmonies and looped electronic effects on ""Where Does Yer Go Now""
    display the group's fascination with psychedelia, and it all swells into a final
    string arrangement of <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> majesty.</p><p>
    
    There are few true lapses on the album, but the slight second track, ""Honeymoon
    With You,"" is one of them.  Sounding like a lost item rescued from the trash bin
    of <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i> sessions, I admire the intentions, but
    after a couple listens through this disc, you realize that despite all of their
    strengths, GZM lacks a strong lyricist to match their compositions.  The flimsy
    sentiments of, ""I wanna honeymoon with you/ Coz I'm feeling so blue/ And if I
    honeymoon with you/ I'll get rid of these blues/ Ooh, ooh, ooh/ Get rid of these
    blues,"" show that no matter how hard they may try, they'll never come up with
    anything with the edge and bite that Lou Reed gave the Velvets.  The only
    intriguing sets of lyrics throughout are those to ""Hodgeston's Hallelujah"" and
    ""Christina,"" a ballad so achingly sweet you're shocked to discover that it's a
    chronicle of an obsessed fan's plan to murder a starlet.</p><p>
    
    ""Where Does Yer Go Now"" and ""Christina"" aren't the only standouts, though.  There
    are strong songs throughout.  The first single from the album, the longing ""Stood
    on Gold"" sounds like it could have been stolen from an Elliott Smith record with
    its breathy vocals and plaintive reflections on age and a lost lover; the earnest
    ""Dead-Aid"" with its melancholy arrangement for violin and hushed horns; the
    slowly swinging groove and sweet duet voices of ""Can Megan""; the brooding Dirty
    Three strings of the sailor's dirge ""These Winds.""</p><p>
    
    I could go on naming great songs off this record, but the
    strength of these tracks only brings me back to the wish that Gorky's Zygotic
    Mynci would put as much effort into their lyrical content as they do with their
    instruments.  I think ""Christina"" is a good template, despite the apparent
    influence of the Beautiful South on their sound.  I'd like to see the band
    acquire more of a morbid wit and irony, or stray further towards a psychedelic
    whimsy a la Neutral Milk Hotel.  I do notice a lot of affinities between the
    Gorkys and the Elephant 6 collective, and I'd love to see the results of bringing
    Jeff Mangum into the mix.  Gorky's Neutral Zygotic Mynci Milk Hotel... maybe it's
    not such a good idea after all.</p></div>"|3528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3528-how-i-long-to-feel-that-summer-in-my-heart/|8.4|Nathan Rooney

Just a small stream flowing south
    toward the Wakarusa about halfway between Kansas City, Missouri and Lawrence,
    Kansas.  My girlfriend and I drive that stretch of I-70 a lot when I visit her
    at her parents' house in Lawrence.  There's something relaxing about the wide
    open spaces and gently rolling terrain of Northeastern Kansas after a long
    flight from the East Coast, and there's something to the lay of the land that
    makes winters there seem extra cold.</p><p>
    
    The guys in Kill Creek must know the same stretch of highway pretty well-- it
    runs through the cornfields they used to get drunk in after their earliest shows
    back in the late 80s, when they were still attending high school in Lawrence.
    Their music has a certain chill of winter to it that most bands of a similar
    ilk don't possess.  Otherwise, the band occupies territory somewhere between the
    Get Up Kids, the Promise Ring, Mineral, and something entirely less strained and
    more current that I can't quite put my finger on.</p><p>
    
    Whereas their older records, like 1996's <i>Proving Winter Cruel</i>, fell
    closely in step with standard emo trends of the mid-90s, their latest effort,
    <i>Colors of Home</i>, shows that the long gap between the two albums has thrown
    their sound open considerably.  For one thing, the tempos are all over the place,
    often staying slow for some surprisingly spacious, quiet material.  The layered
    group vocals of the opener, ""Hardly Accounted For,"" offer a promising start to
    an album that, for all its admirable intents and considerable effort, simply
    doesn't deliver much.</p><p>
    
    ""Hardly Accounted For"" segues smoothly into ""Gett Up,"" which rides in on echoing
    drums with more well-sung harmonies before devolving into aimless guitar
    crunching and overwrought drumming.  There's no math in this Midwestern rock,
    just tempered bombast and a definitive lack of direction.  Both ""Hardly Accounted
    For"" and ""Gett Up"" end abruptly, before they feel like they've run their full
    course.  ""Gett Up"" sounds great, though, when compared to the song that follows.</p><p>
    
    ""Without It"" is full of earnestly churning guitars, vocals stretched beyond
    their capabilities into tuneless, obnoxious yelling, and lyrics like, ""A wait/
    A time/ Alone/ A doubt/ A thought/ A weight/ I wrote/ A vow/ A shred/ Of truth/
    A lie/ Of sorts/ Without a word.""  To be fair, these are the band's lyrics at
    their absolute worst, but the tired emo of the song's music has counterparts in
    several other songs, like ""Mousetrap,"" ""Serotonin,"" and ""Grandfather's Left Side.""</p><p>
    
    The band are far better off when they venture away from blandness of the songs
    mentioned above for tracks like ""The Divorcee,"" a mostly acoustic, drumless tune
    aided immensely by atmospheric keyboards and a downplayed trumpet solo.  The only
    problem is that the song has so little memorable melodic content that it plays
    more like a Rothko than a Caravaggio-- there's a lot of color, but little else.
    This isn't always a bad thing-- hell, I love Mark Rothko's paintings-- but on
    what's essentially a power-pop record, it feels rather incongruous.  That said,
    it's a direction I hope the band continues in, because it holds a lot more
    promise than most of the other styles they work in.</p><p>
    
    Another welcome addition to the band's sound is the slide guitar that crops
    up on ""Cops"" and ""Kathleen.""  In the former, it serves as a distant response
    to the melodic vocals, creeping forth from the back of the mix.  In the
    latter, it's a welcome contrast to the caterwauling vocals and frantically
    strummed guitars of the chorus.</p><p>
    
    The album closes with ""Prying,"" a soft, percussion-free song colored by a
    hint of banjo that, though nice enough, really doesn't leave much of an
    impression.  Kill Creek have certainly improved since their last outing, and
    it seems likely that they'll continue to do so in the future.  But while they
    may have made their best album to date, they still seem a bit lost in the
    former West.</p></div>"|4423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4423-colors-of-home/|5.4|Joe Tangari

People afraid of a little pretentiousness.  Now, I'm
    not talking about bands that attempt to compensate for their shittiness by
    intentionally ruining a perfectly mediocre song (I'm looking at you Old Time
    Relijun) and I'm not talking about the vain, intellectual masturbation of
    prog-rock, but some artists need to have enough faith in the essential decency
    of their talent and songwriting to take that one extra step towards creating
    something wholly unique and original. If not for this, we'd be a world without
    <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>, <i>Ege Bamyasi</i>, and, er, <i>Tales from Topographic
    Oceans</i>.</p><p>
    
    Which brings up a good point. Thanks in no small part to certain overindulgent
    groups who opt for 20-minute synth solos and concept albums crammed with
    socio-political heresy over more original, unexampled experimentation, critics
    have been given a fairly good reason to generally slam music that has the
    slightest hint of pretense. Yet, there are times when even the most seasoned
    reviewer comes across an album without precedent, defying comparison. Ladies
    and Gentlemen, I give you Saul Williams: actor, poet, Old Soul, artist,
    screenwriter, and leader of the oncoming prog-hop revolution.  Catchy?</p><p>
    
    Fresh off his role as a mental patient in <i>K-Pax</i>, Williams has called in
    Rick Rubin (producer of such indie luminaries as Slayer and System of a Down)
    and a small collection of session musicians to help retain that enormous amount
    of indie-cred he wears on his henna-stained sleeve. The scariest part is that
    he pulls it off.</p><p>
    
    Most of you compilation junkies know Saul from his excellent contributions to
    <i>The Lyricist Lounge Soundtrack</i>, <i>Eargasms</i>, and <i>Black Whole
    Styles</i>. Drum-n-bass fans might have caught his high-minded ranting on the
    title track of Krust's <i>Coded Language</i> album (which makes a very welcome
    appearance here). Each previous outing has found our hero donning new sounds in
    his quest to find the perfect musical compliment to his spoken word, and this
    collection is no different.</p><p>
    
    The first third of the disc is easily some of Saul's most inspired work to date,
    as the lyrics examine love, life, and the sociological. ""La La La"" features
    creaking violin flourishes and a chorus of demonic schoolchildren. ""Penny for a
    Thought,"" the first single off the album, comes next, and stands as one of the
    best showcases for Saul's wry sense of wit: ""An MC tells a crowd of hundreds to
    put their hands in the air/ An armed robber steps into a bank and tells everyone
    to put their hands in the air/ A Christian minister gives his benediction while
    the congregation holds their hands in the air.../ Hands up if you're confused.""
    All this-- over a chugging, abstract jungle beat and hi-fi headphone trickery--
    left me a little breathless. Afterwards, I wondered if I was holding a classic.
    Sadly, it wasn't meant to be.</p><p>
    
    Saul has long expressed his dislike for drum machines, devoting whole songs to
    the subject (the phenomenal ""Twice the First Time""), and with this band of
    session musicians behind him, he's free to pursue whatever it is he thinks
    sounds better than his more hip-hop-inspired work. It's on the more band-centric
    tracks that the record's pretentiousness is unsheathed.  It wouldn't hurt if the
    musicians  were more diverse in their playing, but with Rubin at the controls
    they follow a strict formula. Ultimately, it comes off as an amalgamation of
    soul (""She's Out of My Life"") and Rage Against the Machine (whose song ""Broken
    Man"" is sampled on the overlong ""Om Nia Merican""). It's not that these tracks
    are particularly horrible, but they seem to distort the flow of the album and
    sometimes segue in an awkward fashion.</p><p>
    
    The problem is, I don't know of a place for <i>Amethyst Rock Star</i>. Your level
    of enjoyment depends on how much you invest in the lyrics and metaphors-- Saul's
    observations come flying at breakneck speeds and require undivided attention,
    rendering the album unlistenable as background music.  Of course, that's not
    much of a complaint.  Regardless, the man has the confidence and originality
    that lasting careers are made of.  And I can't wait for his masterpiece.</p></div>"|8691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8691-amethyst-rock-star/|8.1|Kevin Adickes

You must have headphones. Berlin-based producer Carsten Nicolai, who
    releases music as Alva.Noto, has assembled an album of tones so pure it would be
    a shame to sully them with the reflective surfaces of your listening area. There
    should be as little space as possible between your eardrums and the pulsing
    diaphragm of the speaker trying (possibly in vain) to translate <i>Transform</i>'s
    pristine sound waves into vibrating pockets of air. If the technology were
    available, one might consider wiring the bitstream of a CD player directly into
    the auditory cortex, thereby eliminating the inevitable distortions introduced
    by irregular vibrations of the eardrum. Alas, such a brilliant invention is
    unlikely in my lifetime, so let's stick with the headphones.</p><p>
    
    Like Ryoji Ikeda, whose <i>+/-</i> album is a major influence here, Carsten
    Nicolai is concerned with the fundamentals of electronic sound production. Sine
    waves, white noise, clicks, pops and beeps-- that's about all there is to the
    ten untitled tracks of <i>Transform</i>. Synthesizers could make all these sounds
    when Brian Eno was a wee lad eyeing the acoustic guitar hanging in the shop
    window.  Music this minimal is like good cooking in that the ingredients are
    simple and the genius is in the arrangement. <i>Transform</i> is like a hot cup
    of delicious miso soup.</p><p>
    
    Nicolai's keen sense of rhythm is the first thing you'll notice about <i>Transform</i>.
    Track 4 has a particularly propulsive drive, with a thrust of bass static,
    stop/start buzzing in the upper register, and something approaching a beat
    coming from the glitches in the midrange. The bass hook that leads into track
    6 has something of a pop quality, with a classic ascending/descending motif
    (just don't hold your breath for a chorus). Nicolai sticks to clear rhythm
    structures and arranges his glitches in riffs, and memorable patterns abound.</p><p>
    
    When he's not forcing his battery of microtones to dance the mashed potato,
    Nicolai delves into icy atmosphere. The tones here are as dry and cold as a
    drafty apartment with baseboard heat, and not even a hint of reverb colors the
    individual sounds. The studied aridity of the recording reinforces the need for
    headphones; hearing even the slightest echo from the back wall would negate what
    <i>Transform</i> seems to be going for. Track 2 is nothing more than a sine wave
    in the 400 Hz range that wavers slowly from ear to ear, topped with a
    cricket-like chorus of static that cuts out occasionally, leaving behind a
    single lonely beep. Track 9 is one of the few tracks to leave the grid behind,
    as hesitant, irregular crackles mimic the sound of a frightened animal, and
    another crystalline drone adds an ominous cast.</p><p>
    
    While <i>Transform</i> is a solid success on its own terms, the record lacks a
    certain spark that might push it into greatness. There are no moments of wonder,
    where you pause and listen closer, straining to understand how something so
    little could affect you so much. It is possible to achieve the sublime with
    these limited ingredients (see Ikeda, for one), but <i>Transform</i> is merely
    good.</p></div>"|143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/143-transform/|7.4|Mark Richard-San

Like two tigers feasting on raw flesh with the white
    blades and inherent aggression nature selected for them, this is uncompromising
    stuff.  The pounding of the skins and various shredded tissue may seem
    unnecessarily grotesque to the uninitiated, but it's no more disgusting than
    your average visionary art.  This is a fierce, relentless exhibition, and
    something that most people aren't prepared for.</p><p>
    
    Ruins are the brawny brainchild of Japanese drummer Tatsuya Yoshida.  When he
    formed the band sometime in the summer of 1985, it was originally supposed to
    be a power trio, but after the guitarist didn't show for their first rehearsal,
    it was bumped down to a bass/drum-only duo. At the time, Yoshida was also
    performing with YBO2, which featured avant-alternative guitarist K.K. Null.
    The seeds of the present-day communal atmosphere of Japanese underground
    musicians began sprouting with this early moonlighting affair, as Null would
    go on to play with Zeni Geva (among others), and Yoshida would go on to play
    with just about everyone.</p><p>
    
    From an early point, Ruins established their alliance to the avant-garde
    tradition. On their earliest recordings, they teamed up with American
    experimental icon John Zorn, and eventually put out albums on his Tzadik
    label. Their sound is dense mix of industrial noise, prog theatrics, and
    free-improvisation. Some critics have used the term ""jazzcore,"" but there
    really is no describing the duo's sound accurately.  They play something of
    a fusion of punk and progressive rock, with an emphasis on everything at
    once.  Almost all of their music features the kind of angular riffs and
    meter-changes made famous by maligned prog bands such as Gentle Giant and
    Emerson, Lake and Palmer, but with precisely 0% of the pretension or general
    pomposity many people associate with that music.</p><p>
    
    Ruins also sing, or something thereabouts, and anyone unaccustomed to total
    vocal freakishness will probably run for cover after a few seconds of this
    stuff.  After 12 studio albums, 10 recorded collaborations, and several EPs
    (not to mention seven-inches and compilation appearances), I'm still taken a
    little aback by Yoshida's jittery caterwauling and current bassist Hisashi
    Sasaki's warbling falsetto.  This kind of approach to vocals probably grew
    from Yoshida's obsession with French bizarro-proggers Magma, who specialized in
    music that was a little like Carl Orff's <i>Carmina Burana</i> crossed with
    early-70s Miles Davis.  In a phrase: the Opera of the Apocalypse, and I think
    that would apply to Ruins as appropriately.</p><p>
<i>Mandala 2000/Live at Kichijoji Mandala II</i> captures the duo in concert,
    performing tunes mostly from their last couple of albums, and a fair amount of
    improv.  It's actually their first decently recorded live album, and is
    definitely the next best thing to witnessing their brand of carnage in person.
    Songs like ""Gharaviss Perrdoh"" and ""Hyderomastgroningem"" get by on sheer super
    rock.  That is, there's still a discernible link to toe-tapping and fist-pumping
    anthem-and-roll here, though you may have to wade through a few layers of
    distortion to find it.  The former tune veers off the path with some fairly
    harsh-- even by Ruins standards-- group improvisation, but quickly rediscovers
    the groove as Sasaki's monster bass drives all its edges into the ground, while
    never betraying the studied dexterity it takes to pull this music off.</p><p>
    
    ""Vrresto,"" ""Bupphairodazz"" and ""Pallaschtom"" are more convoluted samples of
    Ruins phenomena, as riffs and beats fly by so fast that it's often difficult to
    really tell what's going on.  Adding to the confusion is the omnipresent punk
    ethos of always playing with as much intensity and reckless abandon as possible,
    so you'd be forgiven for thinking sizable chunks of the music were mere walls of
    noise.  Listen closer (though I suggest adjusting the volume beforehand), and
    you'll begin to see that it isn't just noise, and that these guys must have
    spent hours rehearsing just to get through a whole tune.  Either that, or
    they're simply not human.  You'd be forgiven for thinking that, too.</p><p>
    
    ""Classical Music Medley"" and ""Hardrock Medley"" are fairly self-explanatory:
    20 or so famous classical and classic rock themes, respectively, get thrown
    in the blender and spit out in two minutes or so.  They're novelty tunes, to be
    sure, but I mean, really, by this point in the album you'll be grateful for
    anything recognizable.  Additionally, there are several tunes featuring
    violinist Katsui Yuji (Rovo, Bondage Fruit); the basic aesthetic remains
    essentially the same, albeit slightly more colorful.  I should also mention
    that you only get about a second of silence in between each of the 23 songs,
    so mathematically speaking, you should be prepared for less than a half-minute,
    cumulatively, to catch your breath.</p><p>
    
    And so we have yet another relentless Ruins album.  I shouldn't have to tell
    you that these guys are an acquired taste for most people.  Personally, I
    think it's the best possible thing that could ever have come out of progressive
    rock, but others might not even consider this music at all.  For newcomers, I
    would advise starting out with one of the studio albums, such as <i>Burning
    Stone</i> or <i>Hyderomastgroningem</i>, before diving in here.  After that,
    check out <i>Symphonica</i>, which tones down the chaos but drastically increases
    the prog factor by adding keyboards and extra singers.  And then, when you're
    ready to settle down to a night of thrills and spills, pop this one in.  It's a
    beast, and I put it to you: go ahead, turn it down, if you must.  This is
    hardcore.  This is Ruins.</p></div>"|11815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11815-mandala-2000live-at-kichijoji-mandala-ii/|8.0|Dominique Leone

Spengler, Stantz, Venkman and Zeddemore were
    unlikely heroes for the 1980s.  In a period of cultural myopia for the USA, when
    stockbrokers and CEOs were shattering glass ceilings, these guys ran a pest
    control business.  They were glorified plumbers, cleaning up the shit nobody
    else would touch.  Plus, they broke the rules, crossing their ghost-catching
    beams when all along they'd been told not to.  And their final enemy was a
    perfect symbol of materialistic excess: the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, a giant
    blob run amok in New York City.  Now, in the wake of our prosperity, as we
    confront the skeletons in our closets, Americans seem to be remembering the
    blue collar once again.</p><p>
    
    Of course, the title of Mitchell Akiyama's new album reminds me of the movie.
    <i>Hope That Lines Don't Cross</i> follows an earlier CDR that Akiyama
    self-released.  His debut album for an honest-to-god record label is also the
    first for Substractif, a subsidiary of Alien8 Recordings.  Akiyama began his
    musical career as a jazz musician, but it doesn't show much in his music.
    Instead, he's composed 10 tracks of minimalist electronica, heavy on the
    glitch-dub influence (think Mille Plateaux artist snd) and fused with drones
    and field recordings of half-heard conversations.  Unfortunately, the worst
    songs here sound like Jan Jelinek's <i>Loop-finding-jazz-records</i> slowed to
    about half-speed, with the plips and pops brought to the foreground and none of
    the rich bass or dynamic transitions that made that album fascinating.  Or, you
    can imagine a limp Pole.</p><p>
    
    The title to ""Palindrone.1"" describes itself, and my annoyance with it, perfectly.
    Bristles of static and a brief voice can be heard in the background.  Out of the
    void rises a drone, augmented by increasingly crisp cracks and echoes of dubwise
    momentum.  But the rhythm never changes.  Rather, it gets decorated with some
    watery sputtering sounds, and eventually fades out much the same as it began.
    ""Resists Chance Nicely"" might be having a go at itself, but I don't see the
    point.  At least the immutable beats here are more complex.  The choppy
    syncopation contrasts just passably enough with the keyboard whims that begin to
    manifest, adding a rumor of warmth.  But ""Concentrate on One Leg"" returns to the
    land of the frigid.  The constant 1-2-whump-whump anaesthetizes the entire track;
    played quietly, the subtle samples are hardly audible, and though it sounds great
    for a second when blasted, the dull thump of the beats will crush your brain in
    the grip of monotony.</p><p>
    
    ""Error Than Trial"" marks the halfway point.  Finally, excitement: we're treated
    to a funky boom-bip glitch beat as weird stabs of electro-plasm appear.  A power
    drill drone that had been lurking in the background roars to life, louder and
    louder until the squabbly synth gossip is entirely overwhelmed.  But even here,
    the structural frame is too simple and predictable, and the surprise only works
    because of the sterile ground surrounding.  Fortunately, the last half of the
    album improves.  ""Named After the Chorus"" actually introduces a melody through
    the lovely ring of the gamelan, cycling over and over in a short lullaby.
    ""Thepathofleastresistanceispaved"" finds the essence of dub minimalism in
    overlapping waves of seductive bass, cryogenic crackles and comfortably numbing
    drums.  And ""The Height of the Matter"" concludes with amazing intensity, its
    rushing currents of noise probing the same dark abyss that Rapoon explores.</p><p>
    
    Akiyama seems to have encountered none of the poltergeists captured by labelmates
    Set Fire to Flames on their recent Alien8 debut.  The phantom voices hidden in
    the depths of this recording don't frighten because they can barely be heard.
    They're drowned out by the clinical tone of his basic rhythms, and they can't
    challenge the listener when they sound so brittle that they seem about to break.
    Even the Ghostbusters wouldn't want to investigate.  Hopefully, in the future,
    Akiyama's jazz background will offer insight into the kind of interplay of
    elements necessary for this kind of animism.  As it is, this is ambient for the
    waiting room of a doctor's office, for stainless steel halls artificially lit, a
    form of foundation makeup for silence.  He may have got the wish in the album
    title, but obsessive compulsion has resulted in neutrality.  Not good.  Not bad.
    Just.</p></div>"|89.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/89-hope-that-lines-dont-cross/|5.0|Christopher Dare

    Underground's secured place in rock's canon has become pretty much watertight.
    Their towering reputation as rock legends is now irrefutable.  Not too shabby
    for a band who, in their day, only sold a handful of records, and whose live
    shows were meagerly attended.  The Velvets' current status has stemmed primarily
    from their four studio albums and their wicked, junk-inspired depravity. But
    what tends to get lost in the praise is the band's reputed brilliance as a live
    act, a reputation that should only grow exponentially after people have a chance
    to hear Robert Quine's tapes.</p><p>
    
    Prior to this release, only a few ""official"" live Velvets releases existed: the
    incredible double-disc set <i>1969</i> and the tour documents from their mid-90s
    reunion being the most readily available.  And then there's the dreadful <i>Live
    at Max's Kansas City</i>, which, while allegedly Reed's documented last stand
    with the group, is of interest only to those with dire historical interest or
    those with a need to hear table conversation revolving around drug scores.  So
    now, with <i>The Quine Tapes</i>, the innocent public can finally find out what
    those confounded bootleggers have been shouting out for nearly thirty years: the
    Velvet Underground live on stage were a staggering dynamic presence, unpredictable
    and explosive.</p><p>
    
    While mentioning bootlegs, I guess I'd better say that what the title of this
    box set suggests is exactly what you get. Unlike Dylan's <i>Live 1966</i> or the
    majority of officially released, artist-sanctioned ""bootlegs,"" this release is a
    murky, sometimes shitty-sounding audience recording by Robert Quine, a rabid VU
    fan who would later play guitar with both Richard Hell and Lou Reed. So, the
    caveat: if you're looking for a pristine audio document, this isn't it.  But if
    you're keen on hearing a record that's crammed with beautiful group interchange
    and a series of magical moments, <i>The Quine Tapes</i> has it all in droves.</p><p>
    
    Capturing the band on a jaunt through the West Coast, Quine and VU archivist
    Bill Levinson have hand-selected a three-disc set of songs that finds the
    Velvets setting up camp in San Francisco amongst the hippies and peaceniks at
    two different venues: the Matrix and Family Dog.  It shatters the illusion of
    the Velvets as decadent East Coast degenerates; on the contrary, Reed sounds
    surprisingly at ease, peppering the performances with friendly between-song
    banter and issuing often-revealing song introductions. The easiness spills over
    into the actual performances as well, which find the band stretching out into
    relaxed improvisations, often transforming arrangements and adlibbing lines. Of
    course, there are still the blistering sonic assaults that you'd expect from the
    Velvet Underground, but ultimately, Reed, Morrison, Tucker and John Cale
    replacement Doug Yule sound right at home.</p><p>
    
    What with Reed's seedy lyrics about blowjobs, sadomasochism and an NYC world of
    hookers and junkie cravings, a tranquil setting isn't exactly what you might
    expect from a Velvets concert. But the majority of tracks here move along at an
    easy, flowing pace-- rarely hurried and always allowing time for the band's
    meandering explorations. The two versions of ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" (both of
    which are universes apart from the anxious edginess evidenced on <i>The Velvet
    Underground &amp; Nico</i>) are leisurely and laid-back, almost entirely abandoning
    the hard-edged grit of the original. In particular, the delightful version from
    the Matrix on the third disc is a gorgeous, loping stroll that finds Lou Reed in
    a remarkably jovial mood, whistling in between a set of improvised verses.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the Velvets slam their feet on the gas pedal and push everything
    furiously into overdrive. With Cale's atonal viola scrapings and dissonant
    experiments gone from the fray, what we've got here is Reed and Sterling Morrison
    urging the others on with full-throttled, bursting-at-the-seams guitar fuzz.
    ""I Can't Stand It"" moves at a fever pitch for over six minutes with Tucker and
    Yule thumping away on percussive duties while Reed unleashes a frantic guitar
    solo. ""Foggy Notion"" is out of the gates in a heady blaze with Morrison and Reed
    swapping riffs in a Chuck Berry-esque rock and roll boogie.</p><p>
    
    The dim points on <i>The Quine Tapes</i> are few and far-flung. With the band
    stretching out into extended jams with re-arranged tempos and rhythms, the misses
    occur much less often than you might imagine.  One of these few instances--
    ""Follow the Leader,"" which opens disc two-- unfortunately drags on ad infinitum,
    the band drudging along in a clamorous din as if they never quite achieved liftoff.
    Some might consider Cale's absence a drawback to these recordings, especially on
    the renditions of earlier songs like ""Black Angel's Death Song,"" ""Heroin"" and
    ""Venus in Furs""; however, with Yule thudding away at the bass and organ, the
    rest of the Velvets crank up the intensity (and volume), substituting massive
    distortion and fuzz for Cale's screeching viola.</p><p>
    
    The best tracks here are the ones in which the band allows space for everything
    to unfold in a lazy haze, playing with sheer exuberance and joy. On the third
    disc, they sound completely rapt with the still fresh ""New Age"" and drift in a
    hypnotic trance while Reed repeats the mantra: ""It's the beginning of the new
    age.""</p><p>
    
    Still, what's most likely to delight fans on this set is the track Quine and
    Levinson have reserved for the final spot on each of the three discs, ""Sister
    Ray,"" which clocks in respectively at 24, 38 and 28 minutes.  ""Sister Ray"" is
    pure rock enchantment, the band casting a spell on their audience and then
    freeing the rein on a guitar roller-coaster joyride.  Like the Matrix version
    of ""I'm Waiting for the Man,"" each take of ""Sister Ray"" focuses more heavily
    on slipshod, careless joy than on the brilliantly concentrated intensity of the
    studio version.  On the third disc's version (taken from Quine's tape of
    Washington University at St. Louis in May '69), Reed starts it with the warning,
    ""This is going to go on for awhile.""  And it does, eventually climaxing into a
    churning maelstrom of distorted fuzz.</p><p>
    
    ""Sister Ray"" was seemingly used to end each show, a cathartic spree into the
    outer limits of the band's sonic imagination.  Beginning as a slow-burner each
    time, Reed spits out the debauched lyrics while the band jumpstarts the
    locomotive engine and lets the train begin its steady roll. Serving as a
    showcase for Reed's hyper-electric guitar-fuzz rave-ups, the band chugs along
    behind him, Yule both bashing and tickling notes out of the organ while Moe
    Tucker beats her kit in time with the engine.  On two of the song's three takes,
    ""Sister Ray"" erupts into the twisted elation of ""Foggy Notion.""  It's all such a
    magnificent, zigzagging mess that there's no wonder the Velvets seemed in such
    high spirits.</p><p>
    
    By the time the locomotive draws to a stop over four hours after the box set's
    first track, you're left in a wake of blistering guitar solos and pure rock and
    roll energy. Robert Quine was one of the lucky few to have experienced the Velvets
    live and, from the evidence gathered here, it looks like he caught them at their
    musical zenith.  If the name of this box is any hint at all (and let's hope that
    it is), what we have here is the first in a series of archival releases that will
    serve to finally shed light on the Velvet Underground's ludicrously mind-boggling
    live incarnation. With their legendary status already secured, <i>The Quine Tapes</i>
    serves to ensure that it's never questioned.</p></div>"|8435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8435-bootleg-series-vol-1-the-quine-tapes/|9.4|Luke Buckman

    even just fragments or reflections of the original-- are ingrained into our
    collective mind. They're all parts of this romantic obsession with cinema:
    flickering black and white projections, dark afternoon theaters, and that instant
    before a film ends where the camera captures someone's face and then irises in
    before the credits roll. Piano Magic has inadvertently been making soundtracks
    for these reflected fragments since the mid-90s. Then again, it's too easy a
    mistake to just stop with that evocative, imagined feel of Saturday matinee
    nostalgia. Because there's also a definite chill to their works, created by a
    lyrical and musical backdrop often filled with ghoulish living-doll voices and a
    David Lynch-goes-<i>Through the Looking Glass</i> sonic surrealism. Still, that's
    missing the band's often Kraut-inspired, layered electronic fuzz, the
    Baroque-type elegies of WWI, and their recent instrumental work that falls
    somewhere into GYBE! terrain.</p><p>
    
    Piano Magic tend to exist in this state of fluctuation. And it's not just the
    music. Since the very beginning, Glen Johnson (the only member of the band with
    any real sense of stasis) has had a revolving-door policy concerning band
    members. The result is a band that's cycled through well over 30 members in just
    over five years' time. And they've recorded one-offs, singles, EPs and albums for
    almost as many labels as they've had members, which makes this compilation a
    welcome entry into the band's catalog (unless you're one of those fetishists who
    plopped down the cash for the original super-limited singles). Because not only
    is a full list of band members included on the inside tray, but this compilation
    collects every a-side, b-side and compilation appearance between 1996 and 2000.</p><p>
    
    If it wasn't obvious before now, <i>Seasonally Affective</i> makes it painfully
    so: Piano Magic and Glen Johnson are at their best when laying down tracks for
    those little slabs of wax we call singles. While much of their full-lengths have
    been spotty with moments of beautiful clarity, the chronologically collected
    works here are brief, sequenced snapshots of the band in shifting phases. The
    result is an often jarring-- the sound may change drastically from one single
    to the next-- amassment of repeatedly beautiful material.</p><p>
    
    Since there's so much material collected herein, it would be too daunting to
    cover everything, so I'll just hit some of the high and low points. The first
    track on the compilation, ""Wrong French,"" is the essence of what can make Piano
    Magic so great. Beginning with drizzled rain atop the creeping hum of organ in
    the distance, it suddenly erupts with crashing thunder before an eerie girl's
    voice begins speaking: ""And there were those films made in the 70s where dolls
    ran through fields, late at night, after men."" Raechel Leigh's voice and the
    purring organ build a haunting frame for the song. The voice, in particular, is,
    although not sinister, very creepy-- the nightmare voice of a doll brought to
    life. Speaking in terse, broken phrases like the string has just been pulled on
    its back: ""His shirt is my dress,"" or, ""It's breaking the jail of ribs,"" or the
    repeated anguish of, ""And he said it won't hurt.""</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, there's ""Wintersport/Cross Country,"" a melancholy-tinged track filled
    with electronic gurgles and shimmering keys while Hazel Burfitt's buoyant vocals
    name-check Charlie Brown, Snoopy (""falls dead in the snow"") and Lucille Ball.
    After the vocals end, we find Johnson and crew really feeling their way in the
    studio, layering clocks tick-tocking away over atmospheric synth, chirping birds,
    and a keyboard click-clacking into gallop mode for a hallucinatory four-minute
    stretch. Two tracks from the seven-inch ""For Engineers"" find Piano Magic in the
    studio trenches yet again, piecing together intricate layers of lo-fi noise and
    blending the sounds of static percussion, the droned murmurs of synthesizer and
    the banging of cans into a continually looping mix.</p><p>
    
    ""The Fun of the Century"" is a beautiful acoustic dirge, with Jen Adam taking over
    vocal duties and crooning out precious lines like, ""Could it be that you broke me
    into a sheet of rain swept sideways?"" Conversely, the disc ends with ""Music for
    Rolex"" which finds Johnson playing it solo and delving into the minutiae of
    studio sound worlds. The result is at odds with much of Piano Magic's downcast
    output, a bubbly keyboard-laden adventure with intermittent bursts of static
    hiss and percussion that bounces along in measured, marching time.</p><p>
    
    Appearing on the second disc, the rare ""Music for Annahbird"" single is presented
    in its entirety, three gorgeous instrumental tracks that are perfect
    representations of what make Johnson a studio whiz kid. The title track is
    loaded with synth-strings over burbling electro-loops, while ""Music for Wasps""
    is all ambience filled with cricket-buzz, swamped-down murky electronics, and a
    distant scraping fuzz. The up-until-now impossibly rare ""Amongst the Books, An
    Angel"" is a glorious gentle track that lurches into a full-steam rocker, finding
    Johnson and Leigh swapping vocals. Beginning very calmly with just Johnson
    singing, the song soon swirls into driving guitar and 4AD-ish howling vocals.</p><p>
    
    Of the two discs here, the second is the weaker, containing some subpar material
    amongst an overall great collection. Many of the complaints about Piano Magic in
    recent memory have been attributed to Johnson's too precious and somber lyric and
    vocal style. And although I don't find his voice difficult to endure, some of his
    lyrics are either horribly missed attempts at serious poetry or hilarious stabs
    at surrealism (""The Canadian Brought Us Snow""): ""Sleeping beside/ Treat us like
    eggs/ Box-jellyfish light/ Tinsel Legs.""</p><p>
    
    A couple of things become apparent after listening to the collection several
    times. Primarily, the lyrics that Johnson pens are best interpreted by other
    singers. Secondly, and somewhat related to Johnson's taking over primary vocal
    duties, there's a distinct difference between the weightiness of early Piano
    Magic and the material rounding out the second disc. While an air of sadness has
    always been present in almost everything issued under the Piano Magic name, the
    earlier work was also saturated with a feel of playful energy and revitalization--
    something that seems to be entirely absent from much of the slit-your-wrists
    depression of later tracks like ""Sketch for Joanne"" and ""The Biggest Lie.""
    Although that's not to say <i>Seasonally Affective</i> isn't worth your time.
    For anyone at all interested in the band, this compilation successfully paints
    Piano Magic as one of the better singles bands of the last few years, a group
    that's consistently rotating members and constantly on the path to reinvention.</p></div>"|6282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6282-seasonally-affective-1996-2000/|7.8|Luke Buckman

He was the first of any of them to talk to
    me. I fingered the cheap plastic band that circled my wrist, and then wriggled
    my toes, which were kept warm in hospital-issue socks with gripped undersides. I
    eyed an overweight woman in her mid-30s. She'd watched me as I slept, and now
    she was following me around, refusing to let me out of her sight.</p><p>
    
    I know how I got there, for the most part, but patient reader (no pun intended),
    your imagination will serve you fine.  Just know that I woke up with the sad
    zombies-- these shell-shocked men and women, most of them middle-aged, who
    drifted through the ward like ghosts, their minds lost in the past, or perhaps
    an alternate present. All I know is, they were neither here nor there.</p><p>
    
    But George, the muscular black guy with the afro and dated flannel shirt, was
    closer to here than there. And he wanted to know if I was okay. It took the
    strength of a scream just to whisper, ""Yes."" Of course, I wasn't, but I was
    pretty sure I was better off than anyone else there. Not better, mind you, but
    better off. That is, my muscles weren't made rigid by anti-schizophrenic drugs.
    I wasn't drooling. And whenever I spoke, I did so with another person.</p><p>
    
    It might seem like a depressing time.  Instead, it was revelatory, even uplifting.
    The same could be said for listening to Spiritualized's latest, <i>Let It Come
    Down</i>. With all of Jason Pierce's tormented vocals, with his talk of addiction
    and recovery, of fractured love, of the burden of religion on the soul; with all
    this, you'd expect him to be confined to a straitjacket. But rather, he manages
    to make it all sound glorious, as if these rock-bottom moments are equally
    responsible for the beauty of living-- or of not dying.</p><p>
    
    Admittedly, some of that glorious feeling comes from the choir, or the brass
    band, or the orchestra-- which, all told, amounts to about 100 contributors to
    Pierce's vision. Meanwhile, Pierce has ditched nearly the entire lineup from
    1997's ambitious <i>Ladies and Gentleman, We are Floating in Space</i>, but
    surprisingly enough, the sound here isn't drastically different, just slightly
    more lush and refined.</p><p>
    
    The caterwauling opener, ""On Fire,"" exhibits this point well enough. A rapid,
    twinkling piano starts the track off, followed by buzzing guitars and then
    Pierce's voice, which tears through the carpe diem lyrics with ample bile:
    ""Let's see how high we can fly before the sun melts the wax on our wings/ Let's
    see how fast we can go before our eyes can't follow the road."" But he's soon
    accompanied by a choir and blasting horns, which propel the sound to almost
    overwhelming heights.</p><p>
    
    The following number, ""Do It All Over Again,"" is the opposite-- a simple,
    uncluttered song. Horns are again used here, as are faint background voices, but
    sparingly; the song is mostly comprised of a crisp acoustic guitar, rumbling
    drums, and Pierce's more relaxed vocals. ""I love you like I love the sun in the
    morning,"" he sings. ""But I don't think a few words of mine are going to make you
    change your mind/ And I'm going to spend the day in bed and I'm planning on
    sleeping my life away."" Somehow, these modest elements combine for one of his
    finest moments yet.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the album lands somewhere between these two tracks. ""Don't Just Do
    Something"" takes the slow-building gospel route, while ""The Twelve Steps"" starts
    with heavy riffs and raucous horns before halting to a bluesy, siren-laden
    interlude reminiscent of <i>Ladies and Gentleman</i>'s 17-minute closer ""Cop
    Shoot Cop"" (which, sadly, doesn't have a counterpart here).</p><p>
    
    ""The Straight and the Narrow,"" a slow, simple ballad about a failure to beat
    addiction-- ""I don't fall off the wagon, you know/ I take a dive and go as deep
    as I can go/ Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow this time""-- is
    yet another epiphany. But so, too, is the 10-minute epic, ""Won't Get to Heaven
    (The State I'm In),"" which overflows with strings and choir voices, then shifts
    at the halfway mark into a funk groove-- all without losing a step.</p><p>
    
    Granted, a few tracks here require perhaps too much patience, or never peak as
    one might expect, or are overburdened with sound. But even these lesser tracks
    contain the simple, yet stunning affirmations that make Pierce so engaging. And
    these moments are revelatory not because of what they say about him, but because
    they have the power to trigger similar affirmations of our own: yes, they rolled
    me into the ward in a wheelchair, even though my legs weren't the problem. But
    I walked out the next day.</p></div>"|7419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7419-let-it-come-down/|8.4|Ryan Kearney

That probably scared away a lot of you.
    For those of you remaining, let me just say that Autour de Lucie doesn't really
    fit the whole Lilith stereotype.  That's to say this is not singer/songwriter
    vitriol spewed at the male-dominated world by some waif with armpit hair, though
    the band is from France, so you never know about the shaving thing.  In fact,
    everyone involved in Autour de Lucie is male except for Valerie Leulliot, the
    band's primary writer and breathy singer/guitarist.</p><p>
    
    This is Autour de Lucie's third album and they immediately deserve props for not
    caving to the pressures of the international record industry and singing in
    English.  These lyrics are all <i>en Francais</i>, and for an English-speaking
    listener, it shrouds the band in an alluring mystique.  For all I know, Leulliot
    could be singing about sniffing glue and snarfing Cheetos, but that's the luxury
    of listening to something that's not in your language-- there's one less thing
    to analyze.</p><p>
<i>Faux Mouvement</i> finds the band moving more fully in <i>un direction
    electronique</i>, terrain they explored ever so briefly on their last outing,
    1999's dark, lush <i>Immobile</i>.  Skittering drum machines and synth textures
    blend nicely with live drumming and string arrangements for a sound that often
    feels icy, despite enveloping you like a well-made afghan.  The richly textured
    opener ""Je Reviens"" demonstrates this paradox nicely, as a cold string section
    swells behind Leulliot's sultry voice, which is pushed all the way forward in
    the mix.</p><p>
    
    ""Je Suis un Balancier"" follows with creeping, filtered beats and organ chords
    under a partly spoken vocal.  It's a bit too long at almost seven minutes, but
    satisfying for at least half its duration, if not all, depending on your mood.
    Of course, the band's decision to sequence the two longest songs on the album
    at the front gives <i>Faux Mouvement</i> an unbalanced feel, and some fine shorter
    songs drift past unnoticed later in the album as a result.  This is compounded
    by the fact that these songs are all composed of roughly the same elements, and
    thus, tend to bleed together.</p><p>
    
    Still, moments such as the abstract beats, close-mic'd hi-hats, and rubbery bass
    groove of ""Sans Commentaire"" show Autour de Lucie as a band very willing to be
    openly experimental.  The main problem with their new will to throw caution to
    the wind and simply play with sound is that when they do so, they forsake the
    catchy melodies and simple structures that made their first two records so
    appealing.  Resultantly, ""Vide"" is interesting if you pay close attention, but
    it's hard to take with you anywhere.  Likewise, the flowing orchestrations on
    ""Chanson de L'Arbre"" are initially compelling, but ultimately remain in the mind
    like a movie score: full of mood, but no grabbing substance.</p><p>
    
    Overall, a general feeling of ennui sets in as you listen to <i>Faux Mouvement</i>
    for the second or third time.  This is a great album to throw on when you need
    something to enhance the mood or otherwise fill the air when working on something
    else (like writing this review).  Unfortunately, if you really want to get to
    know all of these songs, you have to remember which is which by signifiers.  For
    example, ""Lent"" is the song with the muted trumpet in the verse, some kickass
    beats and some freaky guitar work.  God help you if you want to try to remember
    the melody, though, because it hardly exists.</p><p>
    
    It almost appears as if Autour de Lucie are trying to slowly break with their
    pop past in favor of the Brian Eno ambient technique of making music that you
    listen to closely, or walk away from and return to 12 minutes later without
    having missed much.  ""Le Salon"" is the only thing here that really visits the
    familiar pop territory that they used to reside in, replete with a fuzzy bassline
    and Farfisa organ amid the little spacy squiggles floating through the verses.
    But even as the most straightforward track here, it sticks about as well as
    Teflon.</p><p>
    
    As a mood piece, <i>Faux Mouvement</i> plays very well, and as the band's first
    developed foray into the electronic world, it stands as a promising piece.  With
    some work on incorporating the fantastic melodies and songs of old into the
    experimental, moody setting found here, they could really be onto something.
    For now, though, it's best to stick with their first two and wait for album
    quatre.</p></div>"|376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/376-faux-mouvement/|6.2|Joe Tangari

    wiffle-ball bat.  Just something unpleasant enough to communicate my dislike,
    without the risk of causing serious injury.  Come to think of it, maybe that's
    just the problem with London's album.  <i>Col. Summers Park</i> does just enough
    to make a point, to communicate an emotion, but it never goes far enough in any
    one direction to make a serious impact. London swings a peacock feather, instead
    of the Louisville Slugger that any musician should wield if he expects you to
    give a damn.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it's the whole notion of anti-rock.  If you weren't aware, Hush Records
    prides itself as the world's foremost producer of ""anti-rock.""  And just what,
    you're dying to know, <i>is</i> anti-rock?  Damned if I know, but Hush describes
    it as music ""bereft of power chords and bombast, lacking bravado and hot licks,""
    proudly admitting that it is, ""well, weak,"" and promising that, ""Yes, sirree, as
    long as there is rock, we will celebrate our weakness."" Well, fine. Personally,
    I don't think the more moronic strains of rock need an antidote, being
    self-incriminating enough not to require outside assistance. And, well, the rest
    of rock either works or it doesn't. This whole anti-rock thing, though, just
    seems like a cheap trick to avoid being tagged as the more pedestrian ""folk,""
    or the more direct ""sucks shit.""  But, hey, that's neither fair nor accurate.
    Hush has put out a fair amount of really beautiful, really well put together,
    um, ""quiet music."" Some of that can even be found on this Jeff London disc.</p><p>
    
    This album's title song is, melodically speaking, anti-original, but still a
    very pretty track. The doubled vocals on the second verse and the introduction
    of drums shortly thereafter are a few of the details that London uses to good
    effect, in order to build the song up from the soft, insistent guitar strumming
    at the track's outset. Rachel Blumberg, London's vocal adornment and partner on
    several of these songs, offers fragile harmonies that keep things anti-redundant.</p><p>
    
    ""Strong Winters Cease"" reminds me of the coda to a dinner party I attended two
    or three summers ago.  After being pummeled by an endless supply of red wine, the
    party-goers retired to the living room furniture for a sit-down session of ""pass
    around the acoustic guitar and let anybody emboldened enough by the alcohol make
    a fucking ass of himself.""  Like I said, the wine was plentiful.  As one poor
    bastard took the guitar, people shot knowing, nervous glances at each other. And
    then it began.  Tone-deafness and self-assurance make formidable partners, and
    before you know it, everybody was making the same ""struggling to look normal
    even though I have a turd in my mouth"" facial expression.  ""Strong Winters Cease,""
    and particularly London's quavering, meandering lines, remind me very much of
    that performance. Granted, the melody is decent and the song resolves nicely at
    the end, but London's voice sounds best (or rather, anti-worst) when he sticks
    within a tightly circumscribed range.</p><p>
    
    Things dart from insipid to barely-less-so for the next six tracks, with few
    quality stops.  ""Routine Abandonment"" is one of the respites. The distorted bass
    and piano flourishes are executed well enough to keep things interesting, and
    to divert attention from London's whiny pipes.  Certain aspects of other tracks
    work beautifully.  ""Grenada"" flexes beautiful guitar lines and harmonies between
    London and Hailey London, while ""Long Island"" has interesting, if overwrought,
    interplay between a pedal steel guitar, sleighbells, and a Rhodes keyboard. The
    withering, depressed buzzsaw guitar solo that punctures the quietude of ""Cat on
    a String"" is also noteworthy.</p><p>
    
    The album's real stand-out track, however, is the charming ""How Love Is."" It's
    pop magic, sounding something like a Beatles/Motown hybrid, with an amazing
    boy/girl chorus featuring handclaps, an Elvis Costello-esque melody, and the
    line, ""That's how love is/ You can't catch in it a net/ And make it your pet
    for just one day.""</p><p>
    
    I think somewhere along the way, sad-music musicians forgot that the relationship
    between ""quiet,"" ""pretty"" and ""arresting"" is, at most, correlative-- and not
    causal. Jeff London can write a tune, or at least, he has the occasional lucky
    fluke. In any case, there's ample evidence he's got a good feel for pop melody.
    If he'd pawn his acoustic, stop trying to be so damned coffee-shop, and write
    some more bouncy sing-alongers, I'd feel better about urging you to check him
    out.</p></div>"|4836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4836-col-summers-park/|5.7|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    Cameron's third album, <i>We Are A&amp;C;</i>, would be packing your bags and moving
    to the moon.  Trust me.  Even if you never step into a record shop, you will fall
    victim to the duo's precisely organized obnoxiousness.  No boutique, no mall,
    no gas station pump, no sports arena, no roadhouse will be unmolested by the
    dismal facile jollity that Arling and Cameron concoct.  Allow me to illustrate
    this with an indisputable fact, which has been verified by several U.N. agencies
    as well as ASCAP.</p><p>
    
    The first broadcast on post-Taliban Afghan radio was a Pashtun-language ad for
    Old Navy performance fleeces, backed by an Arling and Cameron song. D'oh!
    After six years of no music, no television and no relief from militia-enforced
    beard itch, most Afghanis naturally welcomed such a spritely, happy ditty. But
    the people of the free world have a solemn duty to tell our recently liberated
    brothers and citizens that music can be more than just a mind-erasing jingle.</p><p>
    
    Is it going too far to state that Arling and Cameron are terrorists, hell-bent
    on the banalization of music?  Probably.  But just in case the Dutch duo plan to
    wreak hideous destruction, I'm duty-bound to advise you all in the severest terms
    that if you suspect you or those you care for are being exposed to Arling and
    Cameron:</p><p>
<li>Cover your ears.<p>
<li>Leave the establishment that is host to these pernicious melodies.<p>
<li>Inform your local F.B.I. office without delay.<p>
    
    Now that I've outlined the procedures, I should probably run down what you're
    likely to encounter. I will illustrate what you're to be alert for with reference
    to tracks from their latest and most heinous collection, <i>We Are A&amp;C;</i>.</p><p>
    
    Arling and Cameron take Kraftwerk's <i>Autobahn</i> into lushly harmonized
    surf-pop on ""5th Dimension."" Amid all the blips, beeps, and swirls, the pair
    blithely chant, ""The man machine is on a roll/ Getting closer to our goal/ Total
    freedom of the soul."" ""B.B. Electro"" blasts its horns, ready for a fun-car
    commercial. When another GM-affiliated manufacturer releases its latest VW
    Beetle lookalike, there is a 99.5% certainty that ""B.B. Electro"" will be used
    as its signature tune.</p><p>
    
    On ""Up,"" a nameless diva shouts for you to ""get it up"" over Duane Eddy-style
    twang guitar. ""Up"" has been mechanized for maximum brain-suck during afternoon
    rummages through the sale racks at Urban Outfitters.  The robotically generated,
    faux-trip-hop ""Walk on the Wild Side"" rip-off, ""We Are A&amp;C;"" blatantly declares
    that Arling and Cameron are clones. With lines such as, ""Two fruits from a
    musical tree/ We are A&amp;C;,"" these guys leave me in little doubt that they're
    determined to become the Siegfried and Roy of kitsch dance-pop.</p><p>
    
    The cod-reggae electro fusion ""Coconut Conga"" is infectious, like smallpox, while
    the bouncy Pizzicato Five-goes-lightly-jungle ""Can You Pah-Pah?"" will arouse the
    passion of a thousand post-irony hipsters who will moan into their Campari and
    sodas that this dreck hasn't yet been issued on 8-track.  ""Born in June"" is a
    tender, hanky-waving diva ballad that even Diane Warren wouldn't have had a hand
    in.  Yup, it's that shit.  The professional, Bacharach-y ""Sunday"" could be the
    basis for a standout High Llamas song if Arling and Cameron had bothered to add
    any lyrics beyond ""ba-ba-ba-barabaa"" and some really arse whistling. Closing with
    60 seconds of campy, polka-dotted Le Tigre-isms on ""Don't You Fuck,"" Arling and
    Cameron attempt to prove that, though they're terribly good at horsing around,
    they're not to be messed with.</p><p>
    
    At their least offensive, Arling and Cameron are sickeningly self-congratulatory.
    If, like V/VM or Stock, Hausen and Walkman, the pair's smash-and-grab schtick
    had any bollocks, I'd be enthusiastic. I'd be mildly turned on if they had
    Pizzicato Five's panache or Bertrand Burgalat's harmonic invention. But <i>We
    Are A&amp;C;</i> is feckless junk. Handsomely and repeatedly rewarded for being the
    burglars of pop culture, Arling and Cameron are touting flimsily fashioned
    sweat-shop counterfeits of far more stylish songs. In other words, <i>We Are A&amp;C;</i>
    is perfect for in-store play at Old Navy.  Consider yourselves forewarned.</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/285-we-are-ac/|2.8|Paul Cooper

So far, it's proven to be a
    pretty mild case-- I only notice the ringing during near-silence-- but I decided
    it would be a good idea to take some precautions to avoid further damage.  I
    bought several pairs of ear plugs (at the ridiculous price of $15/pair) that
    claim to ""evenly distribute the dampening of sound across the frequency spectrum.""
    I even schedule silence breaks to give my throbbing eardrums a proper rest.  One
    good thing has come out of this, though: the police have stopped coming to my
    house about noise complaints.</p><p>
    
    I've been anticipating the latest full-length from the Iceland born-and-bred
    trio Stilluppsteypa since last year's subtly melodic EP, <i>Not a Laughing
    Matter, but Rather a Matter of Laughs</i>. When I received <i>Stories Part
    Five</i>-- recently released on Mille Plateaux's Ritornell imprint-- I
    experienced quite a scare: I feared my condition had dramatically worsened. The
    tremolo clicks and phase drones of the opening track, ""Nice Things to File Away
    FOREVER!,"" caught me off-guard.  While not quite as discomforting as my aural
    ailment, the song's electronics are sublimated to the point that the sound coming
    from the speakers approaches ubiquity (not unlike tinnitus).  ""Nice Things""
    approaches ten minutes as collapsing raygun pulses and discordant static buzz at
    high pitches, yet synthesis is never blatant.</p><p>
    
    As the record drones on, a pattern emerges: minimalist glitch tendencies with
    glimpses of beat-keeping allow the synth's atmospheric delay lines to seep
    through to the fore.  Stilluppsteypa avoid the contemporary construct of
    ""intelligence"" in electronic music by keeping their organic explorations to the
    role of sound itself.  Melody feels incidental, but hardly contrived; percussion
    is sparse and precise, but strangely warm, even in its digital synthesis. Static
    hums are prevalent, but they function as integral rather than ornamental. And
    though it resembles a rusted metal shed, there's a purveyed ambiance here that's
    as intriguing as it is unsettling.  It's often headache-inducing, too, if
    listened to for extended periods of time.</p><p>
    
    Steady rhythmic patterns are only present on half of these twelve tracks, but
    when they are, they permeate unchanged.  Of course, the patterns used are
    anything but conventional.  ""Love Brother (of the Parent's House)"" pulses and
    clicks in a bumbling 9/8 time, and the brief set closer, ""We Sure Could Do
    With Some Help,"" is something like an odd samba, which is a bizarre considering
    that the rest of the album is almost completely undanceable.  ""All Drummers
    Shiver"" locks into a filtered, high-speed gallop-- accompanied by swells of drone
    and hiss-- which fades into the dirty squeaks of ""Some Help.""</p><p>
    
    With <i>Stories Part Five</i>, Stilluppsteypa have created an organic aural
    space from the inorganic. They play the studio like an instrument, trading in
    notes and structure for circularity, clicks, and drones that surge with a
    deranged sense of life. In fact, I was listening to the album outside while
    taking a noonday stroll and was overcome with a strange sense of deconstruction
    in the natural environment.  And this would be Stilluppsteypa's gimmick if all
    groups had to have one: they seem to invert the natural and the inorganic.</p></div>"|7518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7518-stories-part-five/|7.5|Christopher F. Schiel

    hip-hop trio Company Flow.  Since CoFlow underwent their ""amicable split"" last
    year, Mr. Len has been on his own.  Suffice it to say, he's doing just fine. And
    his first solo album, <i>Pity the Fool</i>, is the proof.</p><p>
    
    When it comes to MCs, Len uses many of them.  By the time you've reached the
    end of <i>Pity the Fool</i>'s 16 tracks, you've heard nearly 20 different
    individuals-- from Steady Roc, to the Arsonist's Q-Unique, to Atlanta
    up-and-comers Massinfluence. This gives the disc diversity not just in vocal
    delivery, but also in attitude and content.  You've got the ever-amusing Chubb
    Rock ""changing colors like iMacs"" and puffing his skills on ""Dummy Smacks""; Jean
    Grae vamping about a Columbine-style teen rampage on the nine-minute epic ""Taco
    Day""; Lord Sear, pleading with his rotund ""big-chocolate-shake-drinkin', no
    Ultra-Slimfast usin'"" love-interest to never change on ""Girl (Got to Give It to
    Me)."" Maybe it's Mr. Len's effect on his collaborators, but every one of them
    sounds relaxed and confident, like there's nothing better or easier than rapping
    over a Len track.</p><p>
    
    If the MCs are diverse, the beats are Tiger Woods. The whole thing sounds like a
    well-planned mix tape: although no two tracks are the same, you can tell they're
    the product of the same imagination.  Two ends of the spectrum are ""Get Loose""
    and ""Force Fed."" ""Get Loose,"" featuring the admirable flow of Massinfluence, is
    built around the kind of dirty super-wah'd bassline that could have come straight
    off of Miles' <i>On the Corner</i>.  The Pantera-like heavy metal of ""Force Fed,""
    meanwhile, replaces the funk with confrontation and aggression, courtesy of
    Agents of Man and Amplifire.</p><p>
    
    One of the album's standouts, ""Dummy Smacks,"" builds around an upbeat, funky horn
    section, but separates Chubb Rock's from Mr. Live's verses with five different
    ten-second interludes, including a Gregorian drone, a dark electronic sample and
    some soulful blues-fella setting up a Chubb verse by expressing, ""There's
    something I've wanted to say for a long, long time.""  The interludes cut up the
    beat nicely, keeping the horns sounding persistent and fresh.  Len is clearly in
    touch with his ass, and makes it known with his mastery of beat-dynamics,
    modulating them by adding choruses, bridges, or just letting a bassline drop out
    of the mix, to leave only a breakbeat.  ""Get Loose"" is a prime example-- its
    orchestration is steady throughout, but after a few minutes, the mix suddenly
    opens up like it went from mono to stereo.</p><p>
    
    I'm constantly baffled by what constitutes hip-hop's ""underground.""  Apparently,
    the term has nothing to do with obscurity, novelty or musical subversion, because
    <i>Pity the Fool</i> is ""underground,"" and it's none of the above. Neither is it
    a disc rife with musical surprises, abstract concepts or ideological enlightenment.

A full eight
    years have elapsed since <i>Republic</i> dropped in 1993, and, listening back,
    the band's six albums hold up pretty well to modern ears. The band's members
    haven't exactly been slacking off, either, all remaining visible in the interim
    with various projects, including Electronic, the Other Two, and Monaco.  <i>Get
    Ready</i>, the band's seventh album, finds them as able as ever, playing as
    though they'd never been gone, and offering their most organic album in ages.</p><p>
    
    More so than on <i>Republic</i>, <i>Get Ready</i>'s ten songs emphasize the
    songwriterly aspects of the band's sound-- the ones that made theirs some of the
    most transcendent dance music of the last two decades.  The surprising thing
    about much of this album, though, is how much it rocks.  Bernard Sumner's guitar
    is prominent and gritty, thrashing through songs like ""Crystal"" (the opening
    track and first single) with a driving, almost garage-y tone.  Drummer/programmer
    Stephen Morris sticks to the traps more often than usual, always complementing
    his programmed beats with live playing.</p><p>
    
    ""Crystal"" is a fantastic song, possibly one of New Order's best singles.
    Unfortunately, between an extended intro and repetitive, over-long outro, the
    album version loses some of the punch that the single edit offers.  Nonetheless,
    it's hard to deny Peter Hook's amazing bass leads and the song's hook-laden
    chorus.  New Order keep the tempo high for most of the album, and strike gold
    more often than not, especially on the excellent ""Primitive Notion.""  Gillian
    Gilbert's textured synth patches wash over the song in waves, while Morris'
    drumming and programming propel it with busy, frantic rhythms.  Sumner's voice,
    which is sounding decidedly less strained these days, ably carries a deft melody,
    while his guitar playing subtly fills in the rhythmic gaps left by Hook's melodic
    basslines.</p><p>
    
    The aptly titled ""Slow Jam"" follows, pulling back the reigns a little and leaving
    the programmed beats at home for a full-on anthem, replete with multi-tracked
    vocals and a slow, soaring melody.  The band's new focus on songwriting
    occasionally reveals their limitations in unflattering ways, though, such as the
    cringe-worthy opening lyrics of ""Rock the Shack,"" which features backing vocals
    from Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie and Andrew Innes.  ""I've been accused of
    everything/ From Timbuktu to old Berlin/ I need some armor for my flesh/ I need
    to stop and take a rest,"" sings Sumner over a torrent of dirty guitar reminiscent
    of the most straight-forward moments on Primal Scream's <i>Exterminator</i>.
    Gillespie's backing vocals actually detract somewhat from the song, which is
    otherwise an energizing rave-up.</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly better is the cameo from ex-Smashing Pumpkin Billy Corgan on ""Turn
    My Way.""  He turns in backing vocals near the end of the song, though it's easy
    to miss unless you're really paying attention.  Shockingly, Corgan restrains his
    nasal delivery to the point where he almost sounds like Sumner.  With the
    possible exception of Innes, though, the most well-utilized guest is vocalist
    Dawn Zee, whose backing parts on ""Crystal"" and the ultra-danceable ""Someone Like
    You"" offer needed color to the sound.  ""Someone Like You,"" with its wordless
    vocal hooks and relentless beat, makes a good candidate for a second single,
    capable of moving even the most sedentary posteriors.</p><p>
    
    The album closes with the string-laden ballad ""Run Wild,"" a surprisingly tender
    and straight-forward acoustic love song graced by a simple harmonica part and
    lyrics that display an honest devotion to a lover.  Gilbert's keyboard mixes
    brilliantly with the string arrangement for a stirring bridge that leads into
    the uncharacteristically joyful refrain of ""good times around the corner,"" which
    hints at an optimism for the future that has rarely surfaced in New Order's
    songs.  Sumner caps it off with the simple sentiment, ""I'm gonna live 'til I
    die/ I'm gonna live to get high.""</p><p>
    
    All told, <i>Get Ready</i> is a pretty solid effort from a veteran band that
    really has nothing left to prove.  They've managed to bring together a
    consistently rewarding set of songs and added yet another great album to their
    already impressive canon.  Unfortunately, the songwriting at times reveals
    scattered holes, and the songs can draw on for too long.  But if nothing else,
    <i>Get Ready</i> proves that New Order are still capable of putting out an
    enjoyable album.  Let's just hope they don't stay away for eight more years
    before they give us the next one.</p></div>"|5767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5767-get-ready/|7.6|Joe Tangari

Sure, they're a talented bunch (John McEntire, for
    example), but friends are supposed to look out for your best interests; hence
    the common wisdom of ""friends don't let friends (drive drunk/vote Republican/go
    to Michigan State).""  Bobby Conn's friends apparently never got the message. They
    would probably never keep him from driving drunk, voting Republican <i>or</i>
    attending Michigan State.</p><p>
    
    I say this because <i>no one stopped Bobby</i>. At any point, one of them could
    have said, ""Bobby, this <i>The Golden Age</i> thing.  Man, I just think it's a
    bad idea. Are you sure you want to do this?"" But none did. They should all be
    ashamed, like you'd expect the friends who let friends drive Chevy trucks to be
    ashamed.</p><p>
    
    I can imagine the scene, somewhere in Chicago; Bobby spends eight minutes jamming
    on the Virginia Slims motto, ""You've come a long way, baby."" Drummer Colby Stark
    hears it all. He knows the right thing to do.  But Colby is afraid of Bobby,
    maybe because Bobby is more popular than him, or has a hot temper when he's
    making shitty music. So Colby relents, and appeases his self-absorbed
    collaborator:</p><p>
    
    ""That sounds really tight, Bobby.  Really deep.""</p><p>
    
    The first time I heard that track I actually flicked-off my CD player. I send
    that middle-finger directly to you, Colby Stark. You should have known better.
    Wake up and start taking care of your friends.</p><p>
    
    And whoever pianist Nick Sula is, he heard the following line, from the
    ""tongue-in-cheek"" (read: disgusting) folk ballad ""Whore,"" and kept his mouth
    shut: ""I'll be working on your street/ Missing half my teeth/ Give another gummy
    blowjob/ Get myself something good to eat."" You had your chance, Nick, and you
    failed. Now go to confession.</p><p>
    
    The reasons for never buying this album extend far beyond the irritating lyrics.
    Bobby Conn's vocal theatrics will make you ill. They reminded me of Meat Loaf
    crossbred with Rob Halford. His falsetto is one of the worst I've ever heard.
    Furthermore, it seems that Bobby Conn also lacks songwriting ability. Songs
    meander with forgettable melodies and all kinds of twists and turns that bear no
    relationship to one another, other than that they're all copped from 70s glam
    rock, prog rock and funk. On the P-Funk-cum-Robbie Williams tune ""No Revolution,""
    for example, Bobby breathes some Bootsy Collins into a chunky left-hand bassline.
    It sounds alright for a minute, until the trite, happy-time chorus takes over,
    declaring that, ""There will be no revolution here,"" which, coincidentally, was
    exactly what I was thinking for the larger part of <i>The Golden Age</i>.</p><p>
    
    None of this even touches on the demeanor of the album's purveyor. Bobby Conn's
    errors might be forgivable if they were innocent and humble. But they're clearly
    not-- I've read a few interviews with the guy, and suffice it to say, Bobby Conn
    is fond of Bobby Conn. It's almost as if thinks he's playing a trick on rock and
    roll, offering some kind of witty, sarcastic commentary on the genre. Or maybe
    he's being serious.  Who knows?  Furthermore, who cares?  Whatever Bobby Conn was
    aiming for with <i>The Golden Age</i> came out amateurish and obnoxious. With
    that, we can add one more proverb to the list: friends don't let friends listen
    to Bobby Conn.</p></div>"|1579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1579-the-golden-age/|2.9|Brad Haywood

    opportunity to follow the arc of his growth as it happens. When you explore the
    back catalog of an artist well past his prime, you're acting as an archeologist,
    sifting through the dusty fossils trying to figure out for yourself how the
    anklebone connects to the legbone. With an active and dynamic musician working
    through musical problems in the present day, each new release is unknowable to
    some degree, because there's no way to determine what will happen next. That's
    an exciting feeling.</p><p>
    
    Mike Martinez of Electric Birds debuted in 2000 with a surprising self-titled
    album of varied, engrossing, and deeply emotional electronic music. <i>Panorama</i>
    followed in early 2001, an ultimately murky and disappointing affair after the
    superb execution of the debut, as it leaned too heavily on uninspired loops and
    lacked dynamics. Still, Martinez' talent was evident even on that mediocre effort,
    and his second release of 2001, <i>Strata Frames</i>, finds him returning to form
    as he refines his approach.</p><p>
    
    Like <i>Panorama</i>, <i>Strata Frames</i> finds Electric Birds forgoing the
    variety of the debut in favor of steady, meticulous dissection of a handful of
    moods and textures. Martinez seems to be concentrating primarily on drones and
    ambient glitch with hints of dub and house rhythms. The tone once again is muted,
    with Martinez carefully threading veins of noise and static though the bubbly
    warmth of his synth programming. Even more than previous records, <i>Strata
    Frames</i> resembles the widescreen aquatic approach of Japan's wonderful Neina:
    complex ambient music with a slightly prickly edge.</p><p>
    
    ""Strata 2"" gives instant notice that these dreamy tracks will be laced with
    dissonance. Buzzing static appears first, followed by a deep blue wave of drone
    that rises and falls like a time-lapse photograph of the tide. Bell tones chime
    through the middle section of the track, further extending the seaside metaphor.
    The visual imagery that both ""Strata 2"" and the darker ""Strata 5"" conjure
    doubles the listening pleasure.</p><p>
    
    When beats appear on <i>Strata Frames</i>, they're of the suggestive, holographic
    variety. Kit Clayton is thanked on the album sleeve, and his influence is readily
    apparent in the strokes of digital dub painted onto ""Frames"" (where heavily
    equalized chords throb atop a gentle house beat) and the relatively harsh
    reverberating clicks of ""Sodona."" But these tracks, while engaging enough, are
    not what make Electric Birds special. Martinez' greatest talent is in
    constructing wistful, reflective moods from a palate of lush sounds.</p><p>
    
    ""Pitch Patterns"" is my favorite here, the rare bit of electronic music that can
    get by on sound construction alone. The soft cloud of drone that shifts between
    two chords isn't doing anything a second-week piano student couldn't muster, but
    the timbre of the lead sound is so incredibly rich and evocative it carries the
    track on its own. It's the kind of patch anyone who has tinkered with a modular
    synth dreams of creating. A repeating percussion melody and downcast, barely
    audible drum programming complete this elegant piece. Not all of <i>Strata
    Frames</i> is up to the standard of ""Pitch Patterns,"" but it's enough to have me
    anticipating the next Electric Birds release.</p></div>"|2725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2725-strata-frames/|7.6|Mark Richard-San

They don't
    sound like Depeche Mode, they don't sound like Spiritualized, and they sure as
    hell don't sound like My Blood Valentine.  There can only be three reasons for
    critics to make such comparisons in their reviews:</p><p>
    
    1) They're deaf<br/>
    2) They've never listened to any of these seminal bands<br/>
    3) They used the Saddle Creek website as a cheat sheet</p><p>
    
    I'm guessing #3, primarily because the same comparisons are made in the band's
    promotional material.  Likewise, about half of the web's reviews of this
    self-titled debut begin with the fact that Now It's Overhead is the first
    non-Nebraskan act signed to Saddle Creek.  At least this promo factoid points
    us in the right direction, because Athens, Georgia is home to both Now It's
    Overhead and most of the Elephant 6 collective.  They share a unique blend of
    psychedelic pop and indie rock, far from the darkwave and shoegazer tendencies
    you'd imagine from all those reviews.</p><p>
    
    Like the individual Elephant 6 groups, the Now It's Overhead project arises from
    the vision of a singular songwriter.  In this case, the iconic bandleader is Andy
    LeMaster, who wrote most of the songs and played a lot of the instruments.  The
    band is rounded out by Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor, more commonly known as the
    lovely duo Azure Ray.  They provide gentle backing harmonies to LeMaster's lead
    and play an assortment of keyboards that mix nicely with Clay Leverett's
    versatile drumming.  LeMaster is one-third owner of Athens' Chase Park
    Transduction studio, and his recording experience is evident in the unique
    production work throughout, a mysterious aura both high in fidelity and abstract
    in definition.  But despite all they have going for them, I just don't like a
    lot of these songs.</p><p>
    
    Take the first, ""Blackout Curtain,"" for example.  It starts promisingly enough,
    with the soft patter of percussion and the faintest hint of Azure Ray-style
    sighing in the background.  Then guest vocalist Melissa Etheridge steps in.
    Except it's not her; it's just Andy LeMaster's twangy whine.  Don't get me wrong--
    I don't have anything against southern accents.  It's just that his voice in
    particular pierces with its almost unbearably desperate pitch.  Worse, after the
    verse builds into a hopeful mix of keyboard and acoustic guitar, the chorus goes
    all gospel.  The instruments drop out in one of those calculated radio-hit
    moments and the voices rise in harmony: ""Don't ever go away from here, and I
    will never go away.""  If there's any soul at all here, it's streaming on down
    from Billy Joel's ""River of Dreams.""</p><p>
    
    Likewise, the second track lights up like an ELO epic, with the same ""ah-ah-ah""
    electronic pulse.  The lyrics might stab at your heart, though: ""Your goddamn
    uncle changed you some/ When you were five, more than once.""  LeMaster narrates
    the runaway well, very Teena Brandon-esque; it's hard to mock a story about abuse.
    But this song is called ""Who's Jon,"" you see, and LeMaster short circuits
    everything with the kind of pap sentiment that Boys Don't Cry had the sense to
    avoid: ""Who's Jon anyway?  What does it mean, what did you expect me to say?""
    If only Number Five could appear and start breakdancing.  He'd have more
    personality than this Jon D'oh.</p><p>
    
    ""Hold Your Spin"" starts off nice with whispering keyboards that give way to a
    relentless, militaristic thump and LeMaster's distorted vocals.  The song shifts
    suddenly to a bouncy Ben Folds-style bridge, accented by strange claps radiating
    from different spots in the speaker.  But every incidence of pop decency seems
    spoiled by the goofy choruses: ""Were you born sideways?  Did you have to rotate?""
    In some ideal world, this music would be the catchy chatter on the radio.  But
    I've realized that this is the same pop inanity I'd make fun of if it were all
    over the airwaves.  Sure, ""6th Grade Roller"" is a great driving song, with its
    danceable beat, maracas and analog synth, but do you really need to hear, ""Fly
    around a ring/ I fly around a ring,"" repeated ad nauseum?  It's been trapped in
    my head all day.</p><p>
    
    The later songs lose the pop luster and gain lyrical sensitivity.  ""Wonderful
    Scar"" links a childhood accident with growing up, and the simple electric guitar
    chords and cymbal crashes make it a touching vignette.  LeMaster's twang softens
    as the album moves on, and his composition skills become evident.  The sparse
    drums and piano on ""With a Subtle Look"" illustrate a painful absence as he sings,
    ""We started off across the room, locking eyes and subtle clues/ Connection then
    devotion grew, closer than our mothers knew... Now all the words we saved return
    to curse your name.""  Voices spiral eerily in the background, a disembodied drone
    used again in the splintered percussion and humming ambience of the melancholy
    album closer, ""A Skeleton on Display.""</p><p>
    
    Now It's Overhead is a very personal album.  If you enjoy Olivia Tremor Control,
    Neutral Milk Hotel or Elf Power, add a point or two to this rating.  You might
    enjoy the combination of surreal production and unconventional rock, as well as
    LeMaster's ability to write songs that delve between the black-and-white into
    emotional complexity.  But to compare: if Mercury Rev's <i>Deserter's Songs</i>
    illustrates its tale of relationships through a window into pastoral Americana,
    <i>Now It's Overhead</i> tells a fragmented tale of a boy's coming-of-age framed
    through some superficial tricks from popular radio.  The moodiness is a pill
    that's sweetened to the point where I gag.  So I can't help but warn: you might
    want to duck this one.</p></div>"|5852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5852-now-its-overhead/|6.0|Christopher Dare

Who'd have
    thought that our lives would bear witness to bioterrorism and mass destruction?
    Even the album cover tacitly cautions against optimism.  Yes, life might bring
    you a million dollar check one day, but as symbolized by the ambulance on <i>Life
    Is Full of Possibilities</i>' artwork, the envelope could be smeared with
    anthrax spores.</p><p>
    Dntel's Jimmy Tamborello couldn't have known of present hazards when he put
    together this uniformly superb album; what he did know was that it was time to
    progress as an artist.  Dntel's previous albums-- released on the maverick
    Californian extreme IDM label, Phthalo-- showcased Tamborello's mastery of the
    \xB5-Ziq form.  Both <i>Early Works for Me If It Works for You</i> and <i>Something
    Always Goes Wrong</i> are heavily indebted to Mike Paradinas' askance appreciation
    of melody and spastic beat programming.  Tamborello's transition from slinging
    ""Eno-core"" bass bricks in his first band (the Los Angeles-based ambient pop band
    Strictly Ballroom) to creating exemplary IDM appeared effortless.  And though
    <i>Something Always Goes Wrong</i> didn't demonstrate much desire to explore
    uncharted sonic realms, it remained an engaging and rewarding listen.</p><p>
    But with <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i>, Tamborello separates himself from
    the tired, poor and huddled masses of bedroom programmers.  Enlisting members of
    the West Coast indie elite, the album is a matchless combination of scratchy
    indie rock and post-Oval electronics. What impresses most about the record,
    beyond the strength of the songs, is Tamborello's willingness to treat his
    vocalists as he would a synth tone. Most musicians are content to let their
    guests contribute a couple of lines and leave it at that-- at most, they'll tack
    on a cheeseball vocoder effect.  Tamborello takes it a step further, cutting up
    and contorting members of Beachwood Sparks, That Dog, and Death Cab for Cutie.</p><p>
    Tamborello crinkles and manipulates vocalist Chris Gunst, the frontman for both
    Strictly Ballroom and Beachwood Sparks.  But this is more than a bassist's
    revenge on his former band's lead singer.  As Gunst sings the first lines to
    ""Umbrella,"" Tamborello inserts micropauses into the phonemes Gunst utters. When
    Gunst's nostrum, ""You can turn the city upside down if you want to/ But it won't
    keep you dry,"" appears for a second time, Tamborello clothes it with a delicate
    vacuum cleaner sound. On its third appearance, Gunst's voice appears <i>au
    natural</i>; instead, it's the accompaniment-- a church organ and a swarm of
    ambience swirls-- that Tamborello alters before a relatively conventional drum
    machine beat kicks ""Umbrella"" through the classic-opening-track goal posts.</p><p>
    As superb as ""Umbrella"" is, it's not a patch on ""Anywhere Anyone,"" a track which
    features L.A. performance poet and singer/songwriter Mia Doi Todd, who provided
    the recent Dublab compilation, <i>Freeways</i>, with its best moment: ""Digital
    Version 2.1.""  In Tamborello, Todd has found her musical soulmate. As she
    plaintively sings, ""How can you love me if you don't love yourself,"" Tamborello's
    accompaniment swoons and swoops in its dense coverings, until a tinny xylophone
    chimes through with the most delicate of melodies and accompaniments. It's
    similar in effect to the way Björk uses harp lines amid the fuzz and static of
    <i>Vespertine</i>'s glitchier moments.</p><p>
    The drifting aleatoric ambience of ""Pillowcase"" reminds me of David Kristian's
    <i>Roomtone</i> sonic sculptures. Sounds waft by or linger barely long enough to
    register as rhythmic or melodic phrases. ""Fear of Corners,"" in its crackled way,
    vies with Aaliyah and Timbaland's ""Try Again"" for most rhythmically obtuse but
    still mad funky programming.  Like ""Try Again,"" ""Fear of Corners"" is fearful of
    its inherent groove, and muffles it with smothering ambience. Nonetheless, the
    insuppressible and awkward beats persist with an Autechre-ish resilience.</p><p>
    Tamborello's partner in the electro-pop act Figurine, Meredith Figurine, takes
    vocal duties on ""Suddenly is Sooner Than You Think."" Figurine tries her utmost
    to match Mia Doi Todd's heartfelt bleakness; instead, she has to settle for
    matching Dani Siciliano, the serene vocalist of Herbert's masterful <i>Bodily
    Functions</i> album.  This is hardly a major concession, especially given that
    Tamborello's setting for the song appears to confirm to Matthew Herbert's
    Personal Contract for the Composition of Music manifesto. The only thing you
    might miss on this track is a fat beat, but the filigree lyrics and processed
    accordions would sound really crap with a two-step monster pattern humping away
    at them.  Tamborello, like Herbert, has nobly allowed good taste to dictate his
    approach, rather than the prospect of a club hit.</p><p>
    The title track begins as another David Kristian-style sound sculpture before
    transforming into ringing bells conversing with abstract noises that bubble up
    from the impenetrable deep. As such, Tamborello succinctly and accurately
    describes life's possibilities becoming actualities. ""Why I'm So Unhappy""
    features former That Dog bassist, Rachel Haden. Haden collaborated with the For
    Carnation's Brain McMahan (also the ex-frontman of Slint) on the song's lyrics.
    But despite the track's pedigree, I'm distracted from the lyrics by the beauty
    of Haden's voice and how Tamborello frames it: in drifting strings and Björkish
    ambiance.  Towards the end of the song, Tamborello forces every element-- Haden's
    voice, the sparse percussion, and the guitar-- through broken distortion.</p><p>
    However excellent ""Why I'm So Unhappy"" is, it's eclipsed in brilliance by ""(This
    is) The Dream of Evan and Chan."" Death Cab for Cutie's Benjamin Gibbard guests
    and compliments Tamborello's most melodic, Eno-esque distortions with his wistful
    lyrics of nostalgia (""He then played every song from 1993/ The crowd applauded/
    He curtsied bashfully).  Tamborello brings in the sturdy beats that were such a

<i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i> confirms that, while possibilities exist in
    a quantum state of probability, it takes a special person to convert them into
    certainties.  I've only become this ecstatic about one other album this year
    (Herbert's <i>Bodily Functions</i>), and <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i>
    exceeds even that landmark album.  Possibly, it'll have an similar effect on
    you.</p></div>"|2397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2397-life-is-full-of-possibilities/|9.3|Paul Cooper

    I've never really given much thought to his sleaziness, but my impression of
    Patton has always been of this convulsive, hyperactive kid who never stands
    still, always screaming and jumping around.  This has been especially true in
    his recent musical output, as Patton has schemed with an ever-increasing number
    of co-conspirators, including Merzbow, John Zorn, Kid606, Dan the Automator,
    Melt-Banana, Bob Ostertag, and Sepultura-- not to mention his record label,
    Ipecac, or his spastic vocal work with Faith No More, Mr. Bungle and Fantômas.
    So, Mike Patton's post-Faith No More days have been quite demanding. And now,
    as if he didn't have enough on his plate, he's put together the semi-supergroup
    Tomahawk.</p><p>
    Tomahawk finds Patton joining forces with three lesser-known guys from three
    well-known bands-- Jesus Lizard guitarist Duane Denison, Melvins bassist Kevin
    Rutmanis, and Helmet drummer John Stanier-- for a project that attempts to continue
    his recent genre-defying leanings. Mr. Bungle is often typified by the band's
    ability to leap musical borders in a single bound, seamlessly blending genres
    like heavy metal, polka and surf guitar. Tomahawk, while much less prone to these
    rapid, schizophrenic musical shifts, is still dipping its fingers into a number
    of different territories, with a tremendous bent towards Patton's style of heavy
    metal and a twisted, barely recognizable brand of country. I suppose the fact
    that Tomahawk convened in Nashville to record the album may have something to do
    with their oblique take on country music.</p><p>
    It doesn't much matter who Patton's playing with here because, like almost any
    project in which he's involved, the showcase in Tomahawk is on Patton's vocals
    and lyrics. At times, he'll whisper in a low-key croon; other times, he'll turn
    into the monster under your bed, howling out these outlandish visions at the top
    of his lungs. Lyrically, he's still penning the same ghoulish, b-horror-movie
    tales about murderous hitchhikers, gruesome deaths, and coming-of-age sexual
    deviance, but the carnival dementia emblematic of much of the Bungle work is
    laid aside here in favor of a warped rural landscape.  A country noir, perhaps?</p><p>
    No matter what Patton is singing, I just can't shake the feeling that all these
    scenes are taking place in the dead of night-- on deserted highways or in
    abandoned mobile homes out in the middle of the woods-- with sinister-looking
    shadows creeping all around. And this is one of the things that makes Mike Patton
    one of the greatest male vocalists around today. He's got a voice with the
    uncanny ability to drop you right into the song, whether it's defying gravity on
    one of his nightmare carnival rides, or sitting across the seat from a demented
    hitchhiker, gun to your temple.</p><p>
    There's a handful of incredible tracks here, like ""Flashback,"" in which Patton
    weaves a yarn about dysfunctional childhood memories recalled through hypnosis:
    ""Did they make you wear a dress/ Did they?/ Did they laugh and make you watch/
    Did they?"" or ""Bend over and we'll hush the squealing/ Put on the mask and dance
    for Daddy.""  Of course, this is pretty disturbing territory for most lyricists,
    but it's everyday stomping ground for the guy who wrote ""Love Is a Fist.""
    Elsewhere, we've got the ode to car-jacking, ""101 North,"" that finds Patton
    growling in a deep, gruff voice, and ""POP 1,"" in which he repeatedly screams the
    refrain, ""This beat could win me a Grammy,"" over a spattering of Stanier's drum
    fills.  A rage-filled scream festival, ""Sir Yes Sir"" is spastic hardcore that
    finds Tomahawk blaring full-speed a la John Zorn's Naked City over layered
    screaming of the title phrase.</p><p>
    The band's perverse style of country music is especially noticeable on tracks
    like ""Cul de Sac"" and ""Laredo."" The former is a brief lo-fi number-- mainly
    acoustic guitar and Patton's voice buried under hissing, scratchy production.
    The result is an exquisite track that stands out from everything else here. With
    lines like, ""Sunbathing on the shores of a nightmare/ I wish you were here,"" this
    is as close as Patton gets to a straight-up love song.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, Patton's trademark voice and nefarious lyrics are the best things
    Tomahawk has going.  With the exception of Denison's guitar work and some fine
    electronics manipulation, the rest of the band is just backup for Patton's madman
    ravings and crazed vocalizing. The problem is that, given his recent musical
    output, it's easy to raise the bar for anything with Patton's name associated
    with it. You might make the mistake of venturing into Tomahawk expecting some
    new genre-hopping adventure similar to Mr. Bungle's <i>California</i>. But, for
    maybe the first time, what Patton and his new cronies have released here is
    really just more of the same.</p><p>
    Part Jesus Lizard, part Helmet and Melvins, part <i>California</i>-era Bungle,
    and part <i>Angel Dust</i>-era Faith No More, <i>Tomahawk</i> is about as
    straightforward as Mike Patton has played it in recent memory.  Not a rehash by
    any means, but definitely breaking no new ground. Maybe that crazed hyperactive
    kid got tired on the musical playground and decided to take a rest. In Patton's
    case, I guess that means some more evil, bone-crushing rock 'n' roll, which ain't
    such a bad thing now, is it?</p></div>"|8098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8098-tomahawk/|7.0|Luke Buckman

Whether I know the people in them
    or not is pretty irrelevant.  There's something about the medium of photography
    that just strikes me.  Maybe it's just the possibility of stumbling across an
    accidental work of art-- that one shot where all the visual elements are balanced
    perfectly and someone exposes perhaps more of their personality than they
    intended.  People can't really hide from a camera; it catches everything, be it
    a touch of nervousness in the smiles of a newlywed couple or the momentary pain
    of exertion on an athlete's face.</p><p>
    
    It seems as though Ben Gibbard, on his latest outing with Death Cab for Cutie,
    the band's third album in just three years, has attempted to capture in his
    lyrics the verbal equivalent of amateur photography.  That's not to say there's
    anything amateur about the poetry in his lyrics-- quite the contrary, in fact--
    but he captures those same little secondary emotions of the moment that cameras
    capture so well.  Add to this the fact that every song here contains at least
    one vividly rendered image in its lyrics, and <i>The Photo Album</i>, rotten pun
    aside, seems a fairly appropriate title.</p><p>
    
    The album opens quietly with the brief, sleepy ""Steadier Footing,"" a glimpse at
    a relationship that seems fated not to be.  The organs, loosely strummed guitar
    and softly struck floor toms conjure a dead-on after-party atmosphere-- quiet,
    empty, a little smoky.  From there, the band heads into ""A Movie Script Ending,""
    which feels the most like a logical extension of their work on last year's <i>We
    Have the Facts and Are Voting Yes</i> of any song here.  The spacious drumming,
    intertwining guitar arpeggios and Gibbard's impassioned tenor pour forth a thick
    syrup of melody in the verses and chorus, before an unfortunately awkward bridge
    disrupts the flow of the song.</p><p>
    
    Such moments haunt the remainder of the album, as well, though they're generally
    not too distracting.  ""We Laugh Indoors"" suffers a bit from too-long instrumental
    passages centering on wandering, loosely connected guitar phrases, but drummer
    Michael Schorr keeps things moving with his insistent backbeat, and the band
    finds their way before long.  Still, form-wise, the song is oddly constructed
    and fairly easy to tune out.  ""Information Travels Faster"" kicks off with one of
    Gibbard's best opening lines.  ""I intentionally wrote it out to be an illegible
    mess/ You wanted me to write you letters, but I'd rather lose your address,"" he
    sings, as the band provides a steady backing for him and his atmospheric piano
    playing.</p><p>
    
    The most gripping song
    musically, though, is also one of the most lyrically puzzling songs Gibbard has
    ever penned.  I'm curious if Gibbard simply had an especially bad experience in
    Los Angeles or something, because ""Why You'd Want to Live Here"" is intensely
    bitter.  Lines like, ""I can't see why you'd want to live here,"" ""It's a lovely
    summer's day and I can almost see a skyline through a thickening shroud of egos/
    Is this the city of angels or demons,"" and, ""You can't swim in a town this
    shallow,"" make me wonder if he even tried to find something he liked about the
    city before he wrote the song.  But while the unrelentingly negative lyrics may
    be hard to digest, the music certainly isn't.  It's like swallowing arsenic with
    candy-- the sweet melody and passionate delivery cause the song to jump out of
    the pack as one of the few actually capable of lodging in your brain.</p><p>
    
    Similarly malicious is ""Styrofoam Plates,"" though the vitriol expressed toward
    the narrator's departed father is a little more understandable when you consider
    the full story laid out in the song's lyrics.  ""It's no stretch to say you were
    not quite a father/ But a donor of seeds/ To a poor single mother/ Who would
    raise us alone/ We never saw the money/ That went down your throat through the
    hole in your belly,"" is a spiteful mouthful to be sure, and it seems quite
    plausible that Gibbard is writing autobiographically, though I won't purport to
    know his family history.</p><p>
    
    One thing you may have noticed by now is that Gibbard has a tendency to sing in
    full, grammatically correct sentences.  This marks him as a unique lyricist to
    be sure, but the downside is that it sometimes forces him to jam a bunch of
    syllables that don't flow very well into a melodic phrase.  This makes for more
    than a few moments where you wonder if he wouldn't be better off resorting to
    a more succinct form.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, though, he has enough facility with his style
    that it doesn't hurt the music too much-- witness the pop excellence of ""I Was a
    Kaleidoscope,"" a song that serves as a good reminder of why Death Cab were
    relentlessly compared to Built to Spill in the early stages of their career.
    Chris Walla's guitar hook shares the foreground nicely with Gibbard, who offers
    lines like, ""My teeth chattered rhythms/ They were grouped in twos and threes/
    Like a Morse code message from me to me.""  John Vanderslice and Sean Nelson
    offer backing vocals to fill out the sound.</p><p>
<i>The Photo Album</i> comes to a curious close as ""Debate Exposes Doubt""
    collapses into quiet but dissonant piano and guitar figures, eventually petering
    out completely.  Overall, it reads like a look through some stranger's photo
    album-- there are a lot incredible images contained within it, but there are
    also a few embarrassing shots and the occasional moment in time that isn't
    framed quite right.  Still, the good outweighs the bad by a fair shot and it's
    more than enough to wonder what kind of images the band has yet to treat us to.</p></div>"|2230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2230-the-photo-album/|7.1|Joe Tangari

    -- Mojo Nixon, ""No Dishes No More""</p><p>
    Maybe the above suggestions are a little drastic, but after hearing this fifth
    LP from New York City's Saturnine, I think it's time we consider at least
    preventing lawyers from forming rock bands. Well, except for the Wrens and Pearls
    Before Swine.  But that's it.  No one else.  And certainly not Saturnine, a pack
    of indie rock holdouts from the class of '94 whose core members-- bassist Mike
    Donofrio and guitarist/vocalist Matt Gallaway-- formed the band while in law
    school at NYU.</p><p>
    Sadly, the most interesting thing about <i>Pleasure of Ruins</i> is the album
    artwork, or rather, lack thereof. It's completely covered in text. Front, back,
    inside, even the CD itself is blanketed in a winding, labyrinthine,
    footnote-and-digression-happy chronicle of the band's history. It's the stuff of
    a Borges short story.</p><p>
    Two telling snippets from the lengthy tale: ""Now we're waiting for the early
    mid-nineties to roar back with the vengeance of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the
    1992 Stanley Cup quarterfinals,"" and, ""Now that we have jobs and careers, we
    don't really care about the latest trends in indie rock.""</p><p>
    Dealing with the first quote, plenty of bands sound stuck in the early
    mid-nineties, but few sound so completely taken by Gin Blossoms jangle that
    they feel the need to erect a immovable monument to it smack in the middle of
    the ever-flowing river of time. This is music in the preservationist vein.
    And what makes <i>Pleasure of Ruins</i> almost ridiculous is that the time
    period it seeks to forever dwell in has basically just ended.  I mean, isn't it
    a little early for this kind of nostalgia?</p><p>
    It's not like the album is completely unlistenable or anything.  In fact,
    <i>Pleasure of Ruins</i> is completely inoffensive indie rock. The band is
    fairly tight, sounding equal parts early Cure and early R.E.M.  And Matt
    Gallaway's voice plays it up, emulating a less haggard Michael Stipe.  At
    times, the band even steps away from complete and utter blandness with, well,
    something slightly less bland.  Take the opening track, ""When We Were Anchors
    for the Sun,"" for example.  It's a nice-enough piece of jangle-pop with passable,
    if unmemorable lyrics (sample: ""We've made a circle in the sand/ We have no
    hunger and I think we have no thirst to buy the land""), and its only
    cringe-inducing moment comes with ""The History of Cleveland,"" which ponders the
    question, ""Whatever happened to a band like Hüsker Dü?/ They should have been
    made superstars/ I doubt they made much money."" Hmm. Indeed.</p><p>
    But what makes this album below average is hinted at in the second of the above
    quotes. I'm glad the boys in Saturnine have ""real jobs"" and don't have the time
    or inclination to keep up with trends, but apparently, they don't have time to
    try anything new or particularly interesting, either. Maybe they're just a little
    too comfortable, I don't know, but the band seems to approach <i>Pleasure of
    Ruins</i> as if there's nothing at stake, and therefore, takes few risks.  And,
    as any music fan knows, no risks means no fun.  Sure, sometimes it's nice to
    sit back and listen to music that expects nothing from you.  But when it's also
    passionless, and draws its inspiration from Del Amitri, it's not something you
    want to go around spending your money on.  Save it for law school.</p></div>"|7005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7005-pleasure-of-ruins/|3.5|Jason Nickey

    compromises; we could do absolutely what we feel like with no respect for
    anybody and no consideration of any consequences no matter what.""</i></p><p>
    -- Jean-Hervé Peron, May 2000</p><p>
    This was the Faust way; a band whose members may never have considered what kind
    of influence they would have on the future of rock and shock and everything in
    decent civilization.  And anyone who hears them either understands Peron's code
    or goes home disappointed (or frustratingly off-put) with the music.  For me,
    one of the great things about many of the classic Krautrock bands is their
    familial ethics, wherein the individual only exists in relation to the whole,
    and the end result is always more than the sum of the parts.  Faust was communal
    like that, and Faust was classic.</p><p>
    Interestingly, thirty years of rumination on what possible inspiration (besides
    the drugs, of course) might have pushed Faust to make such wonderful noise has
    left very little concrete information.  We know that they were six strong, then
    five, and that they had something of a guardian angel watching over them and
    providing them with the bare necessities-- food, money, manufactured importance
    to their record company-- in Uwe Nettlebeck.  We know that they worked and lived
    in a small, abandoned schoolhouse in Wümme for a time, and that most of what came
    out of that schoolhouse gave the alternative education to innocent and willing
    students everywhere.</p><p>
    One thing we don't know is exactly how it all came to pass in Wümme.  Jean-Hervé
    Peron and the rest of the remaining members (including Nettlebeck and engineer
    Kurt Graupner) have all given interviews detailing what went down in during those
    sessions, and relatively insignificant details have come out over time: most of
    the music was recorded on eight-track; the group would often spend days in one
    room recording without a producer to tell them if they were on to something; they
    often built pieces up like parts of chain because they'd recorded so many
    disparate elements at different times.  When I read these things, they seem like
    mostly technical revelations, but nothing ever tells me about the impetus of the
    music.  Where did it come from?</p><p>
    So, Julian Cope calls Faust the most ""mythical"" of the original Krautrock bands,
    and I suppose it makes sense.  The only thing we have from them that's anything
    like informative is the music.  They left their humble schoolhouse in 1973 for
    the Manor (courtesy of omni-label Virgin), and made an album that was predictably
    wonderful, but more refined-- and possibly more civilized-- than their earlier
    works.  Faust left behind most of their wildest dreams in Wümme.  So that it
    turns out we have a tad more to digest than we thought-- with the release of
    <i>BBC Sessions +</i>-- is good news.  It's almost great.</p><p>
<i>BBC Sessions +</i> collects any remaining material not issued on the first
    three proper Faust studio albums or their compilation, <i>71 Minutes of Faust</i>,
    and adds some music in alternate mixes that appeared elsewhere.  The disc had
    previously only been available as part of the absolutely essential <i>Wümme
    Years</i> box set, but has now been issued separately, I guess for anyone who
    has all the remastered original albums and yet didn't buy the box.  No guilt
    trip here though, because this album works well on its own, even if you still
    have no excuse for not owning all the proper albums.  There, I've said my piece.</p><p>
    As it happens, there's only one track here that had anything to with a BBC
    session, and even that is dubious.  ""BBC 1.3.73,"" containing ""The Lurcher,""
    ""Kraut Rock"" and ""Do So,"" was put together by the band for broadcast on a
    BBC radio show.  It's not a live Faust performance, and in fact, it contains
    two-thirds previously released material, albeit with alternate mixes.  ""The
    Lurcher"" is an atypically appropriately titled funk-rock tune, featuring Peron's
    maxi-bass and some very nice sax work.  With its mid-tempo swamp groove and echo
    effects, it almost manages to sound like space-jazz contemporaries such as
    Donald Byrd or <i>Headhunters</i>-era Herbie Hancock.  Of course, Faust always
    had too many rough edges to ever really sound like anyone else, and this bit of
    new information fits into the canon as easily as ein, zwei, drei.</p><p>
    ""Kraut Rock,"" to my ears, is the same as the first song on <i>Faust IV</i>,
    though it's mixed slightly differently, perhaps a bit less claustrophobic.  The
    liner notes list no information to dispute this, but I've never read anything
    from the members of Faust about doing this.  It's interesting to note that this
    version of the song actually appeared before <i>IV</i>'s, because the BBC tape
    aired several months before Faust finished that album.  ""Do So"" is an elongated
    version of the ""Stretch Out Time"" section of <i>The Faust Tapes</i>.  This
    version is a little slower, emphasizing guitar and groove more than the original,
    and it doesn't feature the sax doubling the melody in the chorus.  A curio?  For
    completists?  Well, we're not done yet.</p><p>
    ""Party 9"" is the end of ""Munic/Yesterday"" from <i>71 Minutes</i> until it turns
    into a completely different tune midway through (similar to ""Giggy Smile"" from
    <i>IV</i>).  ""(360)"" is a disorienting piece of German radio broadcast spliced
    with what sounds like a game of ping-pong and a dog barking in the background.
    Then, some boogie-woogie piano comes in, and kids begin shouting, ""Happy birthday
    to you!"" in broken English.  After that, ""Party 10"" enters without a break, as a
    fanfare of sped-up trumpet enters along with something like a wet kazoo.</p><p>
    The previously unreleased ""Party 1"" is a fantastic example of the kind of exotic
    ethnomusicology experiment Faust could come up with on a moment's notice.  It
    begins as a Latin-funk solo drum extravaganza, interspersed with electro-distortions
    and kinetic tom fills.  But just as you make room for an ad-hoc dance-floor in
    the living room, it stops, leading to ""We Are the Hallo Men.""  This tune
    originally appeared on a 1986 release, <i>Munich and Elsewhere</i>, which was
    later compiled on <i>71 Minutes</i>.  ""Hallo Men,"" however, was left off <i>71
    Minutes</i> due to space considerations, so its tripped-out gutbucket funk was
    prematurely hidden from the ears of 21st Century fans.  Phased mellotron and
    stream-of-consciousness proclamations give it that extra <i>jais ne se quoi</i>
    of all the best Faust music.  The album closes with ""So Far"" and ""Meer,"" both
    alternate takes of tracks from <i>So Far</i> and <i>71 Minutes</i>, respectively.</p><p>
    As a whole, this album makes absolutely no sense, pulling elements from several
    great Faust releases, but seemingly randomly as if the whole thing is just an
    excuse to cull everything that didn't fit anywhere else.  And who knows, maybe
    that's what it is, but I prefer to think of it as the most recent in a line of
    efforts to bring out every known ""fact"" about this band to the fore.  When
    everything was over (before it got started again in the early 90s with the
    reunion albums), I imagine Faust's first fans were either still reeling from the
    dazzling display of inspired madness of the classic albums, or busy starting
    their own riots with punk and new wave.  Of course, I would strongly urge
    anyone who hasn't heard the proper albums to check those out well before
    delving into <i>BBC Sessions +</i>.</p></div>"|3018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3018-bbc-sessions/|7.9|Dominique Leone

Critics everywhere stand poised
    and alert, eager to be the one that drives the first nails into the coffin of a
    once-great music scene. They say they've grown tired of this ""post-rock"" nonsense--
    the hybrid of Louisville-style rock, Chicago/AACM-style jazz, unusual
    instrumentation, and heavy experimental leanings that the city has prided itself
    on for the past ten years.  The term itself a confused and failed attempt to
    ground a genre whose only constant is change. They claim that Chicago has gone
    stagnant, and grown too comfortable and reliant on the same formula of
    lazy-but-upbeat songs, pointing to a market overstuffed with <i>TNT</i> rip-offs

    once a lynchpin of Windy City musical circles-- went east, accepted a full-fledged
    membership in Sonic Youth, and started ranting to glossy-paged hipster music
    magazines abut the death of creative music in Chicago.</p><p>
    
    The fact is, if post-rock was all Chicago has to offer, I'd be right in line with
    the other naysayers. After Scott Herren's dead-on imitation of the genre (under
    the name Savath and Savalas), it's hard to argue that the sound hasn't grown a
    bit stale. But the city by the lake is one whose music is as diverse as is its
    people. Contrary to popular belief, there is far more to the Chicago sound than
    Tortoise imposters and math-rock.  Even so, the critics wait, saliva hanging
    from their loosed jowls, and Diamond Jim dons his finest bunny suit for
    photo shoots on Brooklyn rooftops.  Yet, despite its many detractors, the
    Chicago scene is holding its own, preparing for an attack against supposed
    monotony, and allowing new leaders to step into the limelight, to grow and
    develop at their own pace.</p><p>
    
    In Chicago's war against boring music, Fred Lonberg-Holm stands on the front
    lines, armed with nothing but a bow, an ordinary cello and a bag of tricks to
    put the best of clowns to shame. Every bit as likely to contribute lush
    accompaniment for Freakwater as he is to play squealing noise (Lonberg-Holm did
    time in Weasel Walter's constantly evolving free-jazz/metal/noise/performance
    ensemble the Flying Luttenbachers) or to stretch the limits of avant-improvisation
    (take, for example, a duet this summer wherein Lonberg-Holm jammed action figures
    in between his strings and struck them with a modified electric toothbrush, while
    Michael Zerang placed cymbals atop a snare and bashed them with a vibrating dildo),
    there's no accusing Lonberg-Holm of solidarity. This is a man who's played with
    everyone.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Three Henries</i>, ""everyone"" is narrowed down to Ben Vida and Liz Payne--
    one-half of the sleepy post-rock/jazz group Town and Country-- and reedist and
    fellow-former-Luttenbacher Michael Corrigan. It's an interesting grouping; two
    artists from one of the quietest groups in town making music with two compatriots
    of Weasel Walter. Yet, it works; the musicians are well aware of their diverse
    musical lineage, and, like an interracial couple who make public their love
    despite the screams and objections of their inherently racist families, Pillow
    stands unafraid to flaunt them. It's this very willingness to experiment that
    leads me to maintain that Chicago is still a more alive and exciting place to
    make music than most.</p><p>
    
    For those whose exposure to Chicago music ends with the closing notes of
    <i>Standards</i>, the sounds contained on <i>Three Henries</i> might be
    surprising. The album begins with what sounds like a distant alarm clock (I can
    only assume this is the dry ice and tubes Corrigan is credited with playing,
    though really, who knows?) and a random pluck of a guitar. Corrigan jumps in
    with sparse toots arranged in <i>Spiritual</i>-era Art Ensemble style, while
    Lonberg-Holm alternates between long strokes and seemingly random plucks.  Ben
    Vida's guitar lays a background-- his playing reminiscent of the slow-building
    style of Brise-Glace, the musical equivalent of treading water-- while Liz
    Payne's bass lingers in the corner, barely audible. As the movement progresses,
    these dynamics shift, one overtaking the other, dynamics shifting like mad,
    every instrument battling all the others for the listener's ear. Surprising to
    some, yes.  But for those of us every bit as familiar with Jeff Parker and Co.'s
    frequent jazz outings, this is nothing too unusual.</p><p>
    
    The eight improvisations recorded here, all untitled, juggle each player's
    idiosyncrasies well.  It is at times slow-moving and dreamy like a Town and
    Country record, and at others unforgivingly discordant and jarring like so much
    of Lonberg-Holm's other work. Vida plays guitar and accordion. Lonberg-Holm
    switches off, at points, to something called the nyckelharpa. Slow moving, yet
    interlocking with undeniable precision, Pillow comes off as a Chicago-based
    tribute to John Zorn's Naked City. It's an intriguing prospect, and one that's
    hit or miss. For every moment that excites, there's one that lulls. This is the
    nature of the improvisation-- some parts will naturally be more interesting than
    others-- but <i>Three Henries</i> is improvisation properly executed; the slow
    parts serving only make us appreciate the exciting parts even more.</p><p>
    
    Even though Pillow's <i>Three Henries</i> may not be the saving grace that sets
    Chicago back on track, it stands as a fine reminder that the city is unlikely to
    go down with out a fight. It seems everyone in Chicago has played with everyone
    else at least once, and still the vast majority of players here-- all members of
    Pillow included-- maintain a remarkably intuitive grasp on their fellow musicians'
    explorations. This makes for interesting music, where even the less inspired
    moments are still worthy of a close listen. Is <i>Three Henries</i> likely to
    start another underground movement as did Tortoise's <i>TNT</i>?  Naaaah.  But
    it will intrigue those with an open ear, and excite those who know deep in their
    hearts that there's more to the Windy City than post-schlock.</p></div>"|6289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6289-three-henries/|7.2|David M. Pecoraro

The Munich-based experimental
    pop band Lali Puna follow up Radiohead's favorite album, <i>Tridecoder</i>, with
    <i>Scary World Theory</i>. Greenwood has gone through at least four copies of
    <i>Tridecoder</i>. How many copies of <i>Scary World Theory</i> will he get
    through? Or will he spend his millions on keeping its restrained brilliance off
    the streets?</p><p>
    After the dissolution of her previous band, L.B. Page, Lali Puna lynchpin Valérie
    Trebeljahr spent a lot of time avoiding human contact and fostering a profound
    connection with her four-track tape deck. Trebeljahr shared the results of her
    seclusion with the Notwist's Markus Acher, and soon, her <i>Snooze</i> EP was
    released to small but critical acclaim. Having contributed to the ""Hausmusik
    Reienhaus"" series and the Belgian K-raa-k label, Trebeljahr and Acher handpicked
    the crop of the German leftfield scene for additional bandmates.  They came up
    with percussionist Christoph Brandner of the Notwist-affiliated Tied and Tickled
    Trio, and Florian Zimmer keyboardist of Iso 68 and Fred is Dead.</p><p>
    Shortly after the release of <i>Tridecoder</i>, super-genius producer and Lone
    Swordsman Andrew Weatherall admitted that he listened to Lali Puna on a ceaseless
    loop and, as <i>Scary World Theory</i> undeniably points out, there was a very
    good reason for that. Valérie Trebeljahr's blank vocal style has diverted
    attention from the style of music Two Lone Swordsmen are so deeply immersed in.
    Journalists have distracted themselves by attempting to morph Trebeljahr into
    Laetitia Sadier and remain oblivious to the reason that Weatherall loves this
    band so much: Lali Puna's music is a flawless adaptation of the glitch electro
    funk of Two Lone Swordmen's <i>Tiny Reminders</i>. To hammer this point home,
    any meaningful distinction between the two bands broke down when Lali Puna
    ""remixed"" Two Lone Swordsmen's ""It's Not the Worst I've Ever Looked... Just the
    Most I've Ever Cared"" for the Swordsmen's <i>Further Reminders</i> remix LP.</p><p>
<i>Scary World Theory</i> handsomely discounts any accusations of plagiarism but
    isn't so deft at avoiding the lesser charge of imitation. The album starts with
    Sly Stone's fuzzy beat box limping out a rhythm before Trebeljahr's emotionless
    vocals utter the lyrics to ""Nin-com-pop"": ""There was no reason to complain/ It's
    all been candy cream/ Neatly, smooth and clean forever."" After each verse, a
    sparse guitar figure slinks in pursuit of prey while itself being stalked by an
    equally emaciated synth figure. Untroubled by these, Trebeljahr continues blankly
    on: ""Yet things happened just that way/ Realize your fate/ Shut it down, increase
    the pressure.""</p><p>
    Out of the crackles of an Ovalprocessed piano, Trebeljahr chants slogans on
    two-thirds of ""Middle Curse."" From a distance, she hectors listeners to quit
    their jobs, not to cross their fingers, to slam their doors and not look back.
    The bass twirls about the whiplashing snares, the snuffed hi-hats giving the
    impression that the Neptunes had a hand in the production.</p><p>
    Arthur Baker's signature NYC art-disco-punk handclap solo opens ""Bi-Pet"" as
    Trebeljahr warms up her Laurie Anderson-on-Haldol vocals. ""Born/ Bought/
    Discouraged/ All the things we do are pin-up sweet/ In between we're recorders/
    In between we try."" After several passes over these disconsolate lyrics,
    Trebeljahr allows the machines to parade their skeletal elegance, only to be
    called away from the catwalk just as a definite groove gets going. The
    Cure-meets-Tortoise instrumental ""Contratempo"" acts as a spry bridge between the
    passive resignation of ""Bi-Pet"" and the Spartan sumptuousness of the title track.</p><p>
    In a dimension less occupied with Britney and Harry Potter, <i>Scary World
    Theory</i> has won an Ivor Novello award and has been featured in a Baz Luhrmann
    revisionist musical melodrama. All the passion Trebeljahr has pent up during her
    previous performances she now releases in an intense Kahimi Karie hush: ""I've
    never said you'll have to be afraid/ Of the cookie monster/ Beside your bed.""
    The band compliment Trebeljahr's enthusiasm by filling out the sound space with
    warbling organs and staccato guitar lines familiar to anyone who's fallen in
    love with the Notwist's <i>Shrink</i>.</p><p>
    ""50 Faces Of"" shows off the band's competence at leftfield dance music only to
    be out slammed by ""Lowdown,"" a jaw-dropping adaptation of New Order's ""Dream
    Attack."" ""Don't Think"" returns Trebeljahr to the Ovalprocess lab and to the
    blank vocal delivery that mimics the desperation of the lyrics, ""Can't think/
    As I'm answering your questions/ But you won't listen anyway/ I could be mute.""
    ""Come On Home"" closes the album in a menacing electro swirl similar to Andrea
    Parker's <i>Dark Ages</i> EP. Things get truly disturbing as Trebeljahr sings,
    ""The man on the plasticbag looks like terror/ He's staring at me/ I can't see
    why/ His face seems spoiled.""</p><p>
    What Isaac Babel said about writing could easily be applied to the sinewy
    austerity of <i>Scary World Theory</i>: ""Your language becomes clear and strong
    not when you can no longer add but when you can no longer take away."" Unless he's
    overcome with jealousy, Colin Greenwood is going to be mightily overjoyed with
    this release.</p></div>"|4646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4646-scary-world-theory/|8.8|Paul Cooper

    language. Assuming that, by that particular date, Robert Pollard had written
    about 6,000 songs, each one using approximately 10 words that didn't appear in
    other songs, that means that almost one tenth of all the words in the English
    language have appeared somewhere in a Bob Pollard song. Considering that a lot
    of musicians can't seem to get past the same two or three, this is a pretty big
    accomplishment.</p><p>
    Not only does Pollard use a whole lot of words; he usually manages to use them
    in a way that most songwriters would never even think of. Some of the catchiest
    songs Pollard ever wrote are called ""Game of Pricks"" and ""Tractor Rape Chain""--
    unquestionably the only times any of those words have been used in those
    particular orders. Sure, there have been a few moments of unabashed silliness
    (""Kicker of Elves""), and a few lapses into awful cliché (""Hold On Hope,"") but
    generally speaking, Pollard has managed to retain a uniquely skewed lyrical
    vision.</p><p>
    Sadly, the same can't always be said about his music. At his best, Pollard seems
    to be driven by an almost inhumanly sincere passion to create great, timeless
    rock songs. When that sincerity shines through, the results are just fucking
    amazing. When it's corrupted even in the slightest by a wish to appeal to a
    specific audience, or to consciously stray from what Pollard is so very good at,
    the results generally suffer.</p><p>
    Which brings us to <i>Ringworm Interiors</i>, the fifteenth album in Pollard's
    ""Fading Captain"" series, and Pollard's only album thus far with brothers Tim and
    Todd Tobias backing him. While Pollard sings on the album, co-writes its songs,
    and no doubt came up with the name of the band and the album, Todd Tobias seems
    to be the prominent musician here, playing most of the album's instruments and
    co-producing with John Shough.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, it seems that the collaboration between Bob and Todd isn't nearly
    as fruitful as the Bob and Tobe collaborations that were released this year as
    Airport 5, or for that matter, the vast majority of Bob's work with Guided by
    Voices and as a solo artist. Todd Tobias is credited with ""instrumentation and
    noises"" on <i>Ringworm Interiors</i>, and that description certainly seems
    fitting. Aside from the usual setup of guitar, bass, and drums, the album is
    home to lots of strange, squeaky, and crunchy noises.  Unfortunately, the urge
    to fuck around with effects pedals and tape delay never quite meshes with the
    hints of brilliant songwriting that appear throughout the record, resulting in
    an album with a few wonderful moments, but a general feeling of disarray.</p><p>
    Songs like ""You First"" bring to mind Pollard's recent work with the Soft Rock
    Renegades. Wistful, pretty, and melancholy, Pollard lets loose a truly affecting
    melody with a wonderfully natural delivery. It's been said over and over again
    that he makes it look easy-- and even after years and years of songwriting,
    tracks like ""You First"" indicate that he's far from reaching a brick wall.
    ""Apparent the Red Angus"" takes this reflective whimsy a step further, opening
    with a brief vocal melody that's in many ways more similar to Stephen Sondheim
    than Pete Townshend. The song quickly develops into a more rocked out, multi-part
    epic of sorts before returning to its original melody for a brief, shining moment.
    Beautiful stuff, and definitely one of the best Pollard songs in recent memory.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, <i>Ringworm Interiors</i> simply falls short. ""Feel Try Fury"" never
    really delivers on its arena rock promises, and the ""experimental"" snippets of
    dense fuzz and backwards guitar that are scattered all over the album accomplish
    absolutely nothing, other than distracting the listener from the fact that there
    are sometimes some really great songs underneath the layers of aimless
    experimentation. As has always been the case, Pollard remains at his best when
    there's no discernable, conscious effort to do anything other than write great
    songs. On <i>Ringworm Interiors</i>, there's ample proof that the songs are still
    in him. And considering that there are over 600,000 words that have yet to see
    inclusion in a Bob Pollard song, there's plenty of room to hope he'll find a
    better way to let them out.</p></div>"|1479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1479-ringworm-interiors/|6.3|Matt LeMay

Null is a living legend in Japan, and approaching that status elsewhere.
    He started out playing punk noise in the early 80s (akin to early Boredoms),
    but found his first run of fame with the alt-prog trio YBO2, a group that also
    gave an early limelight to Ruins leader Tatsuya Yoshida and SSE labelhead
    Kitamura Masashi.  However, as a guitarist, vocalist and electronic musician,
    Null very quickly learned to multitask, often playing in two or three projects
    simultaneously.  In addition to dozens of solo recordings (working with Western
    luminaries such as Steve Albini, Jim O'Rourke, John Zorn and Fred Frith, and
    Japanese artists such as Merzbow, Otomo Yoshihide and Seiichi Yamamoto), he's
    been associated with almost as many bands as a member (the aforementioned YBO2,
    Zeni Geva, A.N.P., the Hanatarash, Terminal Hz) or producer (Melt Banana, Lewd).
    Now he's the head of his own label, Nux, and to cover that important indie
    credibility issue he's also toured in support of Sonic Youth.</p><p>
    
    Similar to his former bandmate, Yoshida, Null works so frequently and with so
    many people, you might wonder if he hasn't occasionally spread himself a little
    thin.  Also like Yoshida, he tends to compartmentalize his projects; that is, he
    works with O'Rourke, Frith or Merzbow to record live guitar improvisations, goes
    it alone for his electronic releases, or plays with his rock trio Zeni Geva when
    he wants to get a little heavy.  This might explain why his releases maintain
    such a consistent level of interest and creativity-- when focusing on one thing
    at a time, but over several brainstorming sessions each year, Null's discography
    has come out looking as far-reaching and convoluted as, well, those of O'Rourke,
    Zorn and Albini.</p><p>
    
    Zeni Geva has been active since 1987 from Tokyo (though he toured with American
    thrash and grindcore bands such as the Melvins and Pain Teens very early in their
    careers), and is Null's answer to grindcore and the eternally heavy.  Although a
    pessimistic, intensely dark mood pervades just about all the band's music, they
    balance it with super-rock along the lines of mid-70s King Crimson and a love of
    extremities.  Think prog as S&amp;M; accessory, and you're in the ballpark.</p><p>
<i>10,000 Light Years</i>, the band's 12th album, begins with the title track,
    and the group's modus operandi of all things loud, tricky and black doesn't
    appear to have changed much.  The music isn't less complex than like-minded
    American bands like Don Caballero or Boud Deun, but it's infinitely more
    monstrous-- mostly due to Null's overdrive guitar and Steve Albini's ever-raucous
    mix tendencies.  This tune leads to ""Implosion,"" featuring Null's horror-house,
    death-metal vocal stylings.  Most people might dismiss this stuff as overly
    complicated Pantera-lite, especially if they aren't familiar with Null's more
    experimental work.  Truthfully, I don't see a big difference between this and
    your workaday death metal act, but perhaps it's all part of the concept.</p><p>
    
    ""Interzona 2"" (a revision of ""Interzona,"" from their <i>Freedom Bondage</i> album)
    makes some of the album's most effective use of dynamics, and not coincidentally
    makes the best case for this music being more than death metal.  The riffs are
    all still there, and while the overall feeling of claustrophobic doom prevails,
    after close to 15 years of making records, the band knows how to channel their
    power.  ""Last Nanosecond"" travels along similar routes, but adds a tad more
    dexterity to the mix, with ostinato basslines and muted guitar figures helping
    to bring the distant, inevitable frenzy to a boil.  New drummer Masataka Fujikake
    gets heavy props here (and throughout the album) for being precise where a thud
    would've sufficed.  And though thrash drum kingpins like Dave Lombardo and Mick
    Harris may be the archetypes for this style, he has the drill down.</p><p>
    
    There are four more songs on this album.  I'd love to tell you how they
    complimented the heavy metallic discourse already presented, but that would
    be misleading.  See, my only complaint with albums like this is that they can
    tend to be a tad monolithic.  Yes, all of the tunes rock and most of them even
    manage to keep the technical musician inside of me happy, listening to the
    manic, elephant-footed drumming and Null's riffs from hell.  But these tracks
    all sound a little similar to my ears.  While that works for some of his projects
    (the excellent New Kind of Water with O'Rourke being a prime example), it gets
    pretty mind-numbing here.  Null has a history of changing directions and playing
    music you wouldn't have expected him to play, but for now, only those about to
    rock need apply.</p></div>"|8941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8941-10000-light-years/|6.6|Dominique Leone

    all bad things, like we were taught years ago. I'm a firm believer in you shall
    know the truth and the truth shall set you free.  At a very young age I
    understood what life was all about, and I was only a kid. I have very much
    knowledge of what's going on in this world, and it's cruel-- it's inhumane.""<br/>
    -- Lyingdyingwonderbody #3</i></p><p>
    
    Signs of decadence in the Western world are prevalent in American culture, even
    our beloved ""counterculture"" of independent music. Our song lyrics give us away.
    Consider, for example, the entire self-absorbed sub-genre of ""emo,"" or the
    pathetic self-loathing of icons like Radiohead.  Whatever their general subject
    matter, the subject is generally the same: it's all about ""me."" If history tells
    us anything, it's that a decadent society doesn't last long.</p><p>
    
    Something tells me that Set Fire to Flames agrees, and has a bead on the fall of
    the empire.  Part of it derives from their association with the same Canadian
    collective that produced Godspeed You Black Emperor! and Silver Mt. Zion (some
    of you might recognize surname-free individuals like Aidan, Beckie and Sophie).
    The other part has to do with the royally fucked-up liner notes and madmen vignettes
    from Set Fire to Flame's debut LP, <i>Sings Reign Rebuilder</i>. The 13 member
    instrumental group uses the rants of three numbered madmen-- Lyingdyingwonderbody
    one, two and three-- to haunt its already intense and hypnotic instrumental
    drones. When the last (#3) finishes his above-cited rant, Set Fire to Flames
    loops the phrase ""what's going on,"" a question that applies as aptly to our
    culture as to <i>Sings Reign Rebuilder</i>.</p><p>
    
    The album is brilliant, and arises from an incredible concept. Someone in Set
    Fire to Flames was apparently not convinced that they were despondent enough,
    so part of the project-- the whole project, really-- centered around isolation.
    All thirteen members, in addition to sound engineers, techs, etc., piled into a
    decrepit two-story apartment in Montreal and remained there, uninterrupted, for
    five days. According to the band, the idea was to push ""tolerance levels and
    limitations"" to see ""what would actually happen if [they] attempted to record
    improvised drones under those conditions-- and what impact it might have on
    [their] heads.""</p><p>
    
    It took them five days to reach a fine delirium; it took me about three.  Once
    it settles in, <i>Sings Reign Rebuilder</i> is a gripping testament to the power
    of emotional expression in music. About half of the recording is improvised,
    made up largely of improvised percussion (scratching guitar strings, tapping on
    microphones) and incidental noise (creaking floors, foot traffic, police cars).
    The length of the drones is daunting, but after you acclimate to the idea that
    they're not reaching for the same full-bore crescendos as GYBE!, et al, it
    draws you in.</p><p>
    
    The band gets right down to business on ""Vienna Arcweld,"" musing over percussion
    and noise for about ten minutes, before a drum kit gives the track some shape.
    The raw texture apparent on ""Vienna"" binds the entire album-- both the improvised
    and composed pieces. On ""Omaha,"" the dominant motif broods in and out of
    dissonance for the first few minutes, with drums deep in the background playing
    almost independently of the rhythm.  By the end, the drums and the melody have
    joined, with the former gaining strength until they reach an almost tribal
    intensity-- restrained, yet ardent and passionate.</p><p>
    
    Even the most closely composed piece, ""There is No Dance in Frequency and
    Balance,"" has a gritty texture that blends magically with the rest of the album.
    The dark, dirty, Tortoise-style funk is stylistically unique on the disc, but
    contrasted with all of the nebulous improvisation and downcast melancholy, it's
    like an oasis in the desert. The band sees the finest fruits of the
    isolation-concept on ""Shit-heap: Gloria of the New Town Planning,"" the ultimate
    in slow-building tension. It has all of the elements; ambient percussion, tiny
    rhythmic modulations, the subtle increase in tempo, each adding to a bitter
    intensity.</p><p>
    
    The message to the rest of the world's avant-rockers and post-rockers is this:
    find yourself a good ideology, then lock yourself in a hole for a few days and
    make sure to bring your sound engineer (and don't forget to find a few psychos

    added dramatically to the emotional output of Set Fire to Flames, and resulted

    We saw what <i>Rome (Written Upside Down)</i> did for Les Savy Fav's <i>Go Forth</i>
    and we're not happy.  What would have otherwise been a rather fulfilling
    full-length seemed to lack the innovation that was promised by the group's
    tour-de-force EP. I certainly don't want to sentence And You Will Know Us by the
    Trail of Dead to this fate-- expectations easily get out of hand and can quickly
    become insurmountable-- but it appears that they've brought it on themselves.
    Why else would they release this seemingly innocuous collection of scrawling
    post-punk?</p><p>
    
    The band's newly honed songwriting skills become immediately apparent on the
    disc's first track, ""Relative Ways.""  Yes, the Trail of Dead are still having
    a great time attempting to recreate the <i>Daydream Nation</i> experience, but
    here, they're finally pulling it off with enough intensity to convince you that
    the sound still has some uncharted ground to be covered.  That having been said,
    the new EP expands their once-limited musical vocabulary to convey such
    previously foreign topics as happiness and sanguinity.  And the lyrics, though
    still predominantly angstful, have matured to the point of potency and
    quotability.  Here's a slice for you: ""It's okay, I'm a saint/ I forgave your
    mistakes.""  Nevermind that Kevin Allen's voice sounds more like Thurston Moore
    than ever.</p><p>
    
    All too often, artists evolve sonically while choosing to jettison the most
    effective nuances of their music. While I believe it's necessary for artists to
    self-actualize, it should be noted that they tend to alienate much of their
    fanbase in the process.  So, there's something to be said for groups whose
    initial approach to writing consistently yields profound results.  Such is the
    case with ""Blood Rites,"" the EP's obligatory reflection on the essential formula
    of the Trail's previous outings. The recent popularity of such decidedly pubescent
    groups as Slipknot and Papa Roach has made it harder for songs of this genre to
    yield outstanding moments, but the Trail of Dead manage to walk on thin ice
    without slipping, leaving us with the same self-effacing freshness of <i>Madonna</i>
    (the album).</p><p>
    
    This disc marks the first appearance of material written under the wing of
    Interscope Records. The production values are up and the sound has lost a bit
    of the intimacy that was once an integral part of the group's records.  Of course,
    this all seems trivial when compared with the leaps made in style and ability.
    Even the primarily ambient ""Blade Runner,"" which closes the record, is pulled
    off with a formerly unseen grace.  All told, it seems that the Trail have carved
    themselves a comfortable niche in which they can feel free to explore, subvert,
    and bastardize their influences into hideous four-minute gems.</p><p>
    
    It's not easy to cut an ""essential"" EP and, despite the quality of the material
    and the consumer-friendly price, this isn't <i>Rome (Written Upside Down)</i>,
    the Archers of Loaf's <i>Vs. the Greatest of All Time</i>, or Mogwai's <i>EP+2</i>.
    Each of those releases set a precedent by which the rest of their respective
    artists' careers would be judged.  And while <i>Relative Ways</i> is a departure
    for the Trail of Dead, it certainly doesn't mark a radical change in the band's
    aesthetic.  Of course, when judged on its own terms, <i>Relative Ways</i> is
    well worth its price tag and, most importantly, hints at what could be achieved
    if And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead keep the focus that appears to have
    inspired these songs.</p></div>"|180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/180-relative-ways-ep/|8.6|Kevin Adickes

Not familiar with Duluthian etiquette? Here are some
    guidelines you should get acquainted with before you get all elitist on your
    friends and/or subordinates:</p><p>
    
    1. Do not pigeonhole.</p><p>
    
    In referring to Low, refrain from the use of the following words or phrases:
    ""slowcore,"" ""slo-fi,"" ""snorecore,"" etc.  Low doesn't center around being slow,
    and they don't intentionally perform low-tempo songs in order to be ""different.""
    Well, not anymore, anyway, seeing as they've sheepishly admitted that they used
    to tailor songs to the standard slow-and-quiet rubric.  These days, they write
    moving songs with minimalist tendencies.  You can use that one on your comrades.
    And when they respond with a rebuttal on how amazing Incubus' songwriting is,
    tell them that Brandon Boyd's navel really isn't all that attractive.  Usually
    gets them going.</p><p>
    
    2. If you ever happen to be around members of the band, do not under any
    circumstances mention the <i>owL remix Low</i> album.</p><p>
    
    While it's okay to enjoy their somber rendition of ""Little Drummer Boy"" on a Gap
    commercial, it's just weird to hear them while you're actually in the store.  Or
    perhaps you should just avoid the store altogether.</p><p>
    
    3. Low shows are not the place to be rowdy.</p><p>
    
    That means no yelling, clapping at inappropriate times, or singing along
    obnoxiously. While it's standard rock and roll fare to aurally show your
    appreciation for a band and prove that you are the biggest fan in the room, Low
    concerts are closer to a performance of the Marriage of Figaro than a performance
    by Kiss, in that, if you're not completely silent, you might just miss something.</p><p>
    
    Which is a piece of advice that should be dispensed at the door of all Low
    concerts. At least, I wish that it were when listening to <i>Anthony, Are You
    Around?</i>, recorded in November 1999 at La Maroquinerie in Paris and released
    only in Japan on P-Vine. Deemed ""a small victory"" by Alan Sparhawk, the concert
    documented is the first to take place in ""a proper music venue."" As such, there
    are points during the recording when I cringe at the sound of rabid fans
    acknowledging a song that they recognize (""Starfire,"" ""Immune"") or cheering at
    the prospect of a guitar solo (""Blue Christmas"").</p><p>
    
    While these arrangements fundamentally remain faithful to their studio counterparts
    (except for the loss of strings and keyboards), a majority of the tracks are
    imbued with a sense of energy only possible with a live performance in front of
    an audience. ""Rope"" and ""Soon"" are prime testaments, both leaning towards
    sprawling and epic (to the extent that Low can be epic). ""Soon,"" a contender for
    best track present, ditches the strings, replacing them a sense of dynamic
    exemplified by the extended bridge. Mimi Parker's crash echoes the desperation
    built by Alan Sparhawk and Zak Sally (on guitar and bass, respectively) before
    falling back to near-silence as Sparhawk, at his most intense, delivers the
    truncated final verse in a broken voice.</p><p>
    
    Most of the setlist is comprised of <i>Secret Name</i> tracks, with some
    especially delectable oldies and singles thrown in, which the band rarely
    performs: ""Rope,"" ""Lazy,"" ""Joan of Arc,"" and ""No Need"" are all present. And
    while there's a request for ""Sunshine,"" it goes ignored. ""Hey Chicago"" from the
    stunning <i>Songs for a Dead Pilot</i> EP feels short, yet is extremely
    satisfying despite the absence of Chris Freeman's pervasive keyboards. Sparhawk
    introduces ""Blue Christmas"" by saying, ""We're going to do a song originally
    done by the King.""  Parker's vocals stray from Elvis' heavy vibrato, laying bare
    a simple holiday sentiment. The aforementioned guitar solo during the song,
    which was later included on the lauded <i>Christmas</i> EP, reiterates the
    simple maudlin melody, adding a slight tremolo.</p><p>
    
    This recording is sourced from the board, so it's of quality even with some
    noise, but as Alan states in the liner notes, the vocals are a bit high. It's
    also apparent in the recording that the venue is quite small, since you can hear
    the audience so clearly when they yell. As for garnering more fans, this release
    is only available domestically on import from Japan, so I'm sure newcomers
    will consider the $30 price tag a bit steep. This recording, however, does
    epitomize Low, but even without the difference in price, I would direct
    first-timers to <i>Things We Lost in the Fire</i> or <i>The Curtain Hits the
    Cast</i>.</p></div>"|4900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4900-paris-99-anthony-are-you-around/|7.8|Christopher F. Schiel

    black and white shot that looks like it was taken in a closet. In this photo,
    Laner's wearing sunglasses as he sits surrounded by equipment in the poorly lit
    room, looking like a serious fellow committed to his art who just might have a
    vitamin D deficiency. It's just a stupid press shot, but I can't help but think
    of it when I listen to <i>62-56</i>. Both the photograph and this album seem to
    lack life.</p><p>
    
    A very wise man with 18-inch biceps once observed that you can't start a fire
    without a spark, and he just might have been imagining music like <i>62-56</i>
    as he gazed into the eyes of a teenaged Courtney Cox. Through its 45-minute
    length, this record smolders away in the CD tray, a few deep breaths and a
    bundle of kindling from ignition. I should note that this is by no means a bad
    record. Laner's skilled with his laptop software, and he knows how to wring a
    battery of interesting sounds from his synth modules. But only a small handful
    of tracks grab the listener in any real way. Mostly they just motor by like an
    elaborate float in a Mardi Gras parade, admired in passing but never remembered.</p><p>
    
    There are worthwhile moments. The first winner is ""Hyperion."" It's Electric
    Company's only stab at the pop song, a bit of DSP reggae cut with silly squeals
    and buzzes. As well as being the most rhythmically engaging track here by far,
    it's also the only one to show a sense of humor, something that works well in
    the context of heavily processed electronic music (ask an artist on Sonig).</p><p>
    
    I also have to give Electric Company credit for skillful editing, as the songs
    here flow one into another in a way that makes sense. Particularly striking is
    ""Siamang"" into ""Test Card."" The former features a particularly pretty four-note
    keyboard melody in the Aphex style, and as the track segues into ""Test Card"" an
    organic, dubby bassline is brought forward, accented with spare hits of
    feedback.</p><p>
    
    Those three tracks are front-loaded in the first half of the record, and the
    b-side is where this thing falters. ""Simi Valley Radar"" is interesting enough,
    evoking the electronic swamp vibe of Eno's <i>On Land</i>, but the final five
    tracks go nowhere, as Laner seems content to merely string one squiggly sound
    to another, giving little thought to composition or arrangement. The minute-long
    ""New Hearing A"" is crammed with a dozen variations on a Reaktor patch probably
    called ""Crunchy,"" and ""New Hearing B"" cuts and pastes a few from one that might
    be called ""Crackly"" on top.  <i>62-56</i> is not completely devoid of interest,
    but too much of it comes across as passable, generic IDM.</p></div>"|2730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2730-62-56/|5.8|Mark Richard-San

    <i>Come Out of Your Mine</i>, and with just as many midsize record labels vying
    for her signature, Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter Mia Doi Todd went and did
    a very brave thing-- some may call it very stupid.  She decided to turn down all
    offers, formed her own label, and self-released her follow-up album.</p><p>
    
    That album, <i>Zeroone</i>, the first release on City Zen Records, was released
    to significantly less fanfare than it would have received if it came out on, say,
    Sub Pop, which is too bad because it's at least as good as her debut, although
    not much of a progression. Harrowing, introspective, bare-bones voice and guitar,
    with emphasis on complex lyrical interplay, <i>Zeroone</i> is brimming with
    verbal puns and extended metaphors, all delivered with a voice that will stop
    you cold and send you running to either the repeat or stop button, depending
    what you look for in a vocalist.</p><p>
    
    Imagine Tim Buckley meets Nico and you'll be in the ballpark of her sultry
    croons.  Operatic, wavering, and ethereal, but also sullen and detached,
    Todd's voice is the first thing anyone approaching her music will notice. The
    second thing-- and the second potential obstacle-- is her lyrics.  Yes, they're
    replete with literary complexity, but they're also sometimes full of literary
    preciousness.  Some of her songs will surely come off as just a bit too cute,
    even pretentious, to some listeners-- even listeners like me who happen to like
    many of her songs.</p><p>
    
    ""Digital"" is, unfortunately, <i>Zeroone</i>'s lead-off track, and a good example
    of her over-wrought, over-refined, overly grad-school songcrafting.  Hovering
    above her typical but adequate guitar accompaniment, Todd repeats such wordy
    insights as ""digital, binary system, ones and zeros, dark versus light, yin and
    yang,"" and so on and so on and so on. It just tries too hard to make some kind
    of, like, deep observation about life, man.  I don't buy it. It sounds like the
    work of someone who just finished reading her first book on, say, entropic
    heat-death-- or maybe her first Thomas Pynchon novel-- and was inspired too try
    her hand at this whole po-mo gig. And don't even get me started on ""Ziggurat.""
    Its opening verse speaks for itself: ""Ziggurats are built only to crumble/ We
    approach the gods then prepare to tumble down."" Now I'll tolerate this kind of
    heavy-handed grandiosity in my heavy metal, or even in my hip-hop, but I'll be
    damned if I'm going to put up with it in acoustic balladry.</p><p>
    
    But all is forgiven when a song like ""Can I?"" rolls around. Sounding much like
    something off Buckley's <i>Lorca</i> or <i>Starsailor</i> albums, to call it
    haunting would be an understatement.  And simply quoting a line or two wouldn't
    even come close to conveying its power and mystery-- most of that comes from her
    delivery-- but suffice it to say she uses a refrain (""Can I?/ I think I can/ I
    can I think/ Think I can"") to weave a elaborate nexus connecting the various
    meanings within the song to stunning effect.  Although the track is nearly ten
    minutes long and constructed simply from voice and guitar, I can't remember ever
    losing interest for a moment, even after multiple times through.</p><p>
    
    ""Can I?"" alone is worth the price of the album. It makes me willing to trudge
    through the wordy muck constituting some of her other songs, and willing to test
    her future releases, in hope of finding something else so powerful.  But if you
    aren't into dropping $13 for ten minutes of greatness, you can check her out on
    any number of fully <i>Pitchfork</i>-approved releases, like Dntel's <i>Life is
    Full of Possibilities</i> and Dublab's <i>Freeways</i> compilation.</p></div>"|8090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8090-zeroone/|7.1|Jason Nickey

I'll readily admit it.  Pretty much my only moves involve
    jerking my arms robotically and twitching my head back and forth.  Usually,
    the dance I'll do at shows is something I call the indie: basically, you stand
    still with your arms crossed in front of your torso, and nod with mild interest.
    As far as slow dancing at social events is concerned, my girlfriend and I are
    lucky if we make a full rotation over the course of an entire song.  Needless
    to say, group dance fads like the electric slide and the macarena are completely
    beyond me.</p><p>
    
    There was a time when this was true of fewer people.  Back in the 50s, just about
    everyone knew the twist, and before the rock 'n' roll era you had the Charleston,
    the foxtrot, and various other steps that most socially apt people could at least
    convincingly fake.  From what I can gather, the boxstep is fairly similar to
    these other dances, in that it allows a certain amount of interpretation of a
    few basic moves.  You and your partner essentially place your hands strategically
    (one on the shoulder, one in the other person's hand) and move back and forth,
    side to side, forming roughly a box-shape on the floor.</p><p>
    
    I guess I could see doing a dance like that to some of the music Boxstep makes.
    The Pittsburgh septet splits their work pretty evenly between waltzes and
    traditional rock feels, and usually keeps the tempos toward the middle of the
    metronome scale, which, by definition, should offer some prime dancing conditions
    for dancehall traditionalists.</p><p>
    
    ""Ryan's Glacier"" opens <i>The Faces All Look On</i> with a pretty passage
    showcasing Erin Hutter's light touch on the violin and lead guitarist David
    Wallace's country-influenced slide guitar, which proves to be one of the band's
    chief assets over the course of the album.  Primary vocalist Eric Graf enters
    next with what appears to be a vague depiction of the Ice Age.  ""The Appalachians
    were the first to go,"" he deadpans as guest Jackie Dempsey's accordion eases
    its way into the arrangement.  The highlight of the song comes after about four
    minutes, when Wallace's guitar comes to the fore for a brief solo.</p><p>
    
    David Wallace (not to be confused with David Foster Wallace) has a commanding
    guitar tone and an impeccable sense of phrasing that makes his playing the
    emotional lynchpin of Boxstep's sound.  His surf-inflected sound on ""Airport
    Arrivals"" washes over the other instruments like a strong tide, pulling the
    other members to a frenzied coda that caps the song off brilliantly.  Thankfully,
    the band puts him out front rather frequently, allowing his leads to guide the
    dynamics of most of the songs.  Graf's rhythm guitar and Paul LaBrise's able
    piano comping usually free him up to do whatever he wants, too, and his responses
    to the vocal melodies are usually more interesting than the vocals themselves.</p><p>
    
    Which brings me to my main complaint about Boxstep.  The music is strong and
    the band's own production is perfect as far as the instruments are concerned.
    Unfortunately, Graf has a rather unremarkable voice-- his delivery is unrelentingly
    flat.  Second vocalist Sarah Siplak is better, but she's invariably mixed lower,
    and never once takes the lead.  The result of this imbalance is that the
    harmonies come across more as two people singing at the same time than they do
    as actual harmonies. Also, given that Siplak doesn't play any other instruments,
    it might make sense to give her a more prominent role in the band.</p><p>
    
    Graf's vocal melodies are usually fairly average as well.  For instance, on the
    excellent piano-driven waltz ""Irish Elk,"" he just seems to be singing without
    any sense of melodic contour, and he fails to deliver a convincing hook.  On the
    contrary, Wallace delivers not one, but two absolutely sterling guitar solos,
    long on melodic content and devoid of wanky scale running.  Similarly, Hutter's
    brief, understated violin solo in ""11:55"" totally eclipses the vocal melody.</p><p>
    
    The album closes with ""Second Wedding Anniversary,"" an eight-minute song that
    wanders a bit too much to have the epic impact that it seems the band intended.
    Still, it manages to hold your attention for its duration, which is admirable in
    itself.  Moreover, it exemplifies the band's strengths and weaknesses as well as
    any other track.  The strings hover near the middle of the mix, adding color and
    character to the sound, while the rhythm section of bassist T.R. Daddario and
    drummer Greg Cislon provides a solid, understated foundation for it all to rest
    on.  The vocals don't really offer anything memorable, though, and it's up to
    Wallace and his guitar to draw the listener in.  A surprising acoustic guitar
    and accordion coda caps things off nicely.</p><p>
    
    Boxstep are a good band, and <i>The Faces All Look On</i> is a debut that
    positively bursts with potential.  Unfortunately, at this juncture, the moments
    of transcendence are offset by moments of boredom that come a little too
    frequently.  With some work on their melodies and songcraft, Boxstep could
    become great.  And maybe they could even make me want to dance.</p></div>"|894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/894-the-faces-all-look-on/|6.3|Joe Tangari

    notion of personal liberty; self-determination, the triumph of freedom, and most
    of all, independence from tyrants. The American Patriots loved liberty so much
    that they were willing to risk their lives to free themselves from the despotic
    grip of the British monarchy.  So, with the help of French people, the Patriots
    took it upon themselves to beat some ass, after which everything was better.
    God bless America.</p><p>
    
    As the sole member of Idaho, Martin's love of independence mirrors that of our
    noble forefathers. Give Martin liberty or give him death-- just take a look at
    the liner notes for Idaho's sixth and latest LP, <i>Levitate</i>: ""Produced by
    Jeff Martin. All instruments by Jeff Martin. All songs by Jeff Martin."" The
    bastard even ""reserves all of his rights"" (oh wait... does everyone do that?).
    As if he weren't already overburdened with the writing, the production, the
    performing, and the rights-reserving, Martin's music bears his own imprint,
    Idaho Music.</p><p>
    
    It's easy to be cynical of self-reliant rock stars. Often they're assholes, like
    Billy Corgan or Jason Pierce of Spiritualized, who fired his whole band via
    letter. Others we regard as perhaps a little abnormal; Mark Linkous of
    Sparklehorse, for example, whose idea of creativity escapes all but the most
    intoxicated. But, having owned a few Idaho albums and seen them in concert, I
    feel that Jeff Martin's reasons for independence differ from those of his
    self-reliant peers.</p><p>
    
    The biggest reason may be simply that Martin really is more talented than anyone
    he knows. Besides for his obvious ability as an instrumentalist (Martin is a
    classically trained pianist and wields a four-string guitar), what's most
    striking about <i>Levitate</i> is the production quality; like last year's
    <i>Hearts of Palm</i>, the precise, stripped-down approach on <i>Levitate</i> is
    remarkably effective at communicating emotions of longing, loneliness and
    distance. It tends towards a more organic sound than <i>Hearts of Palm</i>; the
    piano remains mostly acoustic, and figures prominently on almost every song.
    But <i>Levitate</i> keeps the innovative guitar, vocal and piano effects and
    manipulations that lent a profound haunting quality to Idaho's prior releases.</p><p>
    
    ""On the Shore,"" for example, includes a lightly played acoustic piano joined by
    Martin's lazy, gentle vocals, and simple percussion that almost mimics rainfall.
    Distorted guitar feedback brings the composition to a halt, leading into
    ""Levitate Pt. 2,"" a preview to the plainly beautiful piano theme of the album's
    title track and finale. ""Santa Claus is Weird"" takes the emotion of distance
    literally; it sounds as if the drum kit is being played on the opposite side of
    a warehouse. You also have little moments like the wispy, spectral voices in the
    break between verses on ""20 Years"" (one of three rock numbers on the disc) that
    tell you Martin is paying attention to detail.</p><p>
<i>Levitate</i> isn't all roses for Martin, though. His lyrics occasionally leave
    something to be desired, as on ""Casa Mia."" Like much of the rest of the album,
    the orchestration of the song effectively communicates loss and regret, but
    Martin then over-enunciates awkward words like ""bougainvillea"" (as in the plant)
    and ""hollow point"" (as in the bullet), both of which stand out as contrived.
    Hardcore ""lyrics people"" may have difficulties with this and a few other tracks.
    In addition, the songwriting on <i>Levitate</i> isn't quite as compelling as
    prior releases-- it tempers some of Martin's passion and intensity, and in doing
    so, loses a bit of its edge.</p><p>
    
    It's easy for sad-rockers to sound melancholy, but it's hard to do it with as
    much elegance as Jeff Martin. <i>Levitate</i> is not Idaho's best release (see
    <i>Three Sheets to the Wind</i> or <i>Hearts of Palm</i>), but it is one of
    their most coherent and complete, palatable from start to finish. Kudos to Jeff
    Martin for creating another fine album on his own, embodying our forefathers'
    ideals of independence and personal liberty, and most importantly, for doing it
    without the aid of the French.</p></div>"|4057.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4057-levitate/|8.3|Brad Haywood

As I
    climbed the steps to the Wicker Park art studio where the band was to perform,
    I couldn't help but wonder how the multi-layered grandiose of songs like ""Between
    Your Ear and the Other Ear"" could possibly translate live. Confounding things
    even more was the knowledge that the Microphones isn't really a band at all, but
    the result of experiments conducted by Phil Elvrum, one man with a uniquely
    twisted take on songwriting and recording.</p><p>
    But no amount of uncertainty could have prepared for what occurred that night.
    Dubbed a ""paper opera,"" the evening's performance was, for better or worse,
    unlike any other I'd ever attended. Among the highlights:</p><p>
<li>Sometimes-Microphones vocalist Khaela Maricich prancing about the studio,
    strumming a ukulele, singing, and brandishing mildly seductive gazes as weapons
    against the stone-cool exteriors of grim-faced indie-boys, slowly coaxing them
    out of their collapsible metal seats and into the aisles.<p>
<li>Calvin Johnson playing the role of MC, dancing hypnotically, occasionally
    picking up his acoustic guitar or signing, and generally standing guard over his
    young talent like some sort of father figure.<p>
<li>Elvrum, usually hiding behind a fort made of newspapers and cheap fabrics,
    sometimes emerging to make up songs on the spot, often while donning an oversized
    cartoon wolf's head, chasing Maricich around the room, stealing audience members'
    sodas, and referring to himself only as ""Big Bad Death.""<p>
    Not a single instrument was amplified.  Not one song off a single Microphones
    album was sung.  There was no proper order of acts; the musicians jumped in and
    out of one another's sets at will.  The performance left two strong impressions
    in my mind.  One was a strong understanding of the ideals behind Johnson's Dub
    Narcotic Studios, which favors community and fooling around over so-called
    proper musicianship. The other? The elimination of any doubt in my mind that
    Phil Elvrum is one fucking strange individual.</p><p>
    Of course, I intend this as the highest of compliments. Without his mind for the
    absurd or his goofball sensibilities, the Microphones would be just another in a
    long line of indistinguishable lo-fi bedroom-pop acts. It's Elvrum's ingenuity
    that found last year's <i>It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water</i> a place at the
    top of so many critics' lists and so close to the hearts of countless listeners.</p><p>
    An oddity in itself, <i>Blood</i> is a super-limited collection released by a
    new vinyl-only imprint called St. Ives, which was opened by Secretly Canadian
    to give established artists an outlet for some of their more experimental
    projects.  Only 300 copies of this record were released, each featuring different
    hand-painted covers.</p><p>
    Musically, <i>Blood</i> is like a collection of b-sides to singles that never
    existed.  Side One is stranger than most Microphones albums (if such a thing is
    imaginable) with constantly contrasting recording styles-- it's equal parts sound
    collage, demo-collection and noise. There's no tracklist to accompany the album,
    so I attempted my own.</p><p>
    1. An arrangement of horns plays a simple melody. Recording is crisp as can be.
    The ear can discern every individual horn.</p><p>
    2. Cheap recording of man talking about painful urination. Lots of static and
    background noise.</p><p>
    3. Droning organ harmonizes with voices. All sound drops out. Solo voice sings a
    cappella, though one gets the feeling that the sound of a silent summer night
    behind him or the all-encompassing hiss of the tape recording might be more
    important than the song in question.</p><p>
    4. Sound collage.  Bits of guitar, droning vocals, shrieking, gongs, heavily
    amplified bass guitar, lots of feedback.</p><p>
    5. High-pitched voices hum a simple tune in harmony.</p><p>
    6. Heavy, but melodic feedback looped through delay pedals.</p><p>
    7. Very lo-fi demo recording; vocal, piano and acoustic guitar. One can barely
    make out the vocals.</p><p>
    8. See no. 6.</p><p>
    9. Like the vocal exercises that proceed a choir practices. Four notes, in
    progression, an ascending melody sung over and over again by an army of voices,
    each of which drop in and out at random. At one point, a piano plays a descending
    melody in the background.</p><p>
    10. Field recording: birds.</p><p>
    11. Multiple tapes of people talking, all running at once.</p><p>
    12. A quick, ska-flavored song, with adorable female vocals and multiple horns
    against a backdrop of organ and drums. ""If you were a mountaintop/ I'd keep
    ascending/ Never stop/ If you were some kind of store/ I'd buy you out/ And wait
    for more."" Probably the album's finest moment. My personal favorite at least.</p><p>
    13. More sound collage, acoustic guitars, organs, and feedback cut-up and pasted
    together. Neat.</p><p>
    14. Begins as a horn interlude. At some point, acoustic guitars join in and
    calming tones give way to distinct melody that builds and builds.</p><p>
    15. A cappella demo of <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>'s ""Map."" Nasty recording,
    apparently done outdoors. At times, the sound of rustling wind overtakes the
    vocals.</p><p>
    16. Voices and wind cut out completely, but the dark, heavy-handed piano and
    tightly kept drum-march that end ""Map"" continue. The recording quality is now
    superb. As per the original, sonic noise bleeds in from the side. Eventually,
    it becomes the only thing you can hear.</p><p>
    Taken as a whole, <i>Blood</i>'s first side is every bit as engaging as the
    Microphone's more proper recordings.  Its eclecticism works to its advantage,
    creating a thoroughly fascinating sonic journey through Elvrum's gleefully
    twisted mind.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, Side Two is far less interesting, comprised mostly of lo-fi demos
    of ""The Mansion,"" ""I Felt My Size,"" ""The Gleam, Pt. 2,"" and ""Samurai Sword.""
    Though the songs stand up in acoustic form, they fail to hold a candle to the
    complete versions on <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>. Placed one after another, they come
    across as frivolous and somewhat unnecessary.</p><p>
    Still, <i>Blood</i> closes on a strong point, with a lo-fi impromptu cover of
    Björk's ""All Is Full of Love,"" spliced with a hi-fi recording of Elvrum at the
    drums, followed by strings and percussion that escalates into the now-trademark
    Microphones wash of noise.</p><p>
    The unnecessary string of demos and the small pressing will likely garner
    <i>Blood</i> non-essential status in the minds of many. Too bad, because most of
    the album sees Elvrum indulging his inner weirdo even more than usual. The result
    is his most eclectic recording yet, one which, at its best moments, absolutely
    stands up to the ""real"" Microphones albums.</p><p>
    More importantly, it stands as a testament to the relaxed nature of the musical
    process curated by Calvin Johnson and utilized by Elvrum-- one which prioritizes
    having fun and nourishing the creative instinct, with the music itself almost an
    afterthought. It's a reminder of an idyllic, nondescript time in music history
    when rules didn't exist, recording was a forbidden word, music was made for
    music's sake, and no one had to be reminded of the energy that could come from
    such freedom.</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|5271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5271-blood/|8.2|David M. Pecoraro

    as a name, David Toop penned an exposé for <i>The Times</i> on the surge of
    Britain's up-and-coming ""bedroom composers.""  The photographs that ran with the
    article showed a slight young man with a prominent Adam's apple, gym-teacher
    glasses and a gnarled ponytail, and the pubescent shadow of a moustache spreading
    over his upper lip.  Dressed plainly in a sweatshirt sporting the name of his
    former band, he tapped at the ivories of his Casio FZ-1 keyboard amid the clutter
    of his mother's house.  Some laughed when Toop said the future of music rested
    in this man's spindly, awkward hands.  But Mike Paradinas, for it was he, laughed
    last.</p><p>
    In the eight years since that article ran, Paradinas has emerged as one of the
    most influential magnates of the avant-electronic scene.  He's now a married
    father of one, living in his own home and managing a first-rate record label
    that he started from scratch.  The moustache is gone, along with the ponytail
    (sold for roughly $80 on eBay)-- and with them, any question of whether Mike
    lived up to Mr. Toop's monumental charge.  Operating under a total of seven
    pseudonyms (omitting collaborations), Paradinas has guided the growth of
    electronic music with genius and grace.  And few works showcase his talent more
    ably than 1993's <i>Tango n' Vectif</i>.</p><p>
    Paradinas' second release, after an impossibly rare 12"" issued under the Diesel
    M moniker, <i>Tango</i> paints in sweeping, creative strokes, unrestrained by
    the genre-based trappings that often limit contemporary IDM.  A few weeks ago,
    Richard D. James' Rephlex label reissued this gem, compiling several unreleased
    tracks with material from the original CD and vinyl releases, as well as the
    long-lost ""PHI*1700"" single.  At two discs and 26 songs, this reissue retails at
    most online vendors for a few dollars less than the 13-track U.S. original.  Nice.</p><p>
    Most of the material on <i>Tango n' Vectif</i> was composed well before its
    release, and in places, the album betrays its age.  The granular fidelity sounds
    unrefined, and straightforward instrumental arrangements like those of the
    ""Phragmal Synthesis"" suite have long since fallen out of favor with the
    ""intelligent"" crowd.  But nitpicking aside, <i>Tango</i> is by all measures a
    truly staggering album.</p><p>
    Consider that in 1993, Autechre released <i>Incunabula</i>, James issued
    <i>Surfing on Sine Waves</i>, the Joyrex 12-inches, and <i>Analogue Bubblebath
    3</i>, and Beaumont Hannant drew critical acclaim for his <i>Tastes and Textures</i>
    series.  Against <i>Tango n' Vectif</i>, even such notably progressive albums
    sound dated and one-dimensional.  And in today's climate of vain experimentation,
    scrupulous precision and perfect sound, \xB5-Ziq's debut, in all its raw glory,
    continues to hold its own.  It's hard to believe that a gangly young recluse
    with no musical training could imagine such bold, poignant textures from the
    confines of a bedroom.</p><p>
    The self-titled opening track wastes no time in showing you where the album
    stands.  A yawning bassline creeps out from the song's recesses, fastened down
    by punishing drums and jagged metallic clangs.  Paradinas tempers the song's
    stark ambiance with simple, playful melodies, lending an emotive irony to the
    piece that is uniquely \xB5-Ziq.</p><p>
    ""Swan Vesta,"" a long-time resident of my pantheon of perfect songs, eludes
    comparison.  This song overwhelms the listener with its stylistic and emotional
    versatility-- the violent swaths of blistering snares, the melancholy strings,
    the idiosyncratic bleeps, the plaintive mechanical cries, the funky tribal
    interludes and the haunting clarity of the central eight-note refrain.  The
    result is as ambiguous and intangible as it is blissful-- a liminal listening
    experience that not only makes you dance or think or cry, but compels you to
    do all of that at once.</p><p>
    It's a hard act to follow, but Mike does his best.  ""Iesope"" is a tranquil
    melodic number whose resonant cave-dubbed samples culminate in a powerfully
    understated three-note resolution.  ""\xB5-Ziq Theme,"" one of several songs from
    <i>Tango</i> that involved the cooperation of Frank Naughton (he left the
    project to focus on schoolwork, but has since released a handful of solo songs
    on Spymania), brings the beat back amid a swirling arpeggio and a lush bed of
    mournful strings.</p><p>
    ""Ad Misericordiam,"" previously available only on the vinyl issue of <i>Tango</i>,
    opens with the drone of gothic synth pads, then slowly phases in jangling
    percussion and squelchy electro melodies.  The pace of the record flags with
    songs like ""Whale Soup"" and ""Die Zweite Heimat,"" but these disappointments
    comprise a clear exception to an otherwise consistently strong album.</p><p>
    Paradinas mines a different vein with ""Xolbe 2,"" a subdued, rhythmic piece bathed
    in layers of tinny static.  The new additions (""Driving Is Easy,"" ""Methyl Albion""
    and ""Glink"") also go down well, though only ""Glink"" parallels the standard set by
    the original album.  Even so, I have a hard time finding fault with their
    inclusion on the reissue-- all three songs offer something of value and, thanks
    to the absurd politics of the record industry, they won't run buyers any extra
    flow.</p><p>
    Eight years ago, <i>Tango n' Vectif</i> offered to change the code of modern
    electronica.  Until recently, its plea fell on deaf American ears.  Now we've
    entered the 21st century, and in some respects, we're still catching up with
    what Mike Paradinas did in 1993-- perhaps the finest period of his career.  You
    can call this record groundbreaking, or relevant, or just a real riot to listen
    to.  I call it a masterpiece, and I don't think any IDM enthusiast can tell the
    sky from the ground without it.</p></div>"|8321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8321-tango-n-vectif/|9.4|Malcolm Seymour III

On the one hand, Matt Marque's debut album is
    a nicely crafted little package of songs, stuffed with fine musicianship from
    some of Chicago's finest scenesters, including five members and associates of
    the Boxhead Ensemble.  He even got Brahms to play some piano for him.  Well,
    it's not that Brahms-- this guy's name is Carl-- but he does a good job.  But
    there's one thing offsetting all of this that I'm having a hard time getting
    past, and that's Matt Marque's voice.</p><p>
    
    To his credit, no one else sounds quite like Marque on the mic.  To his discredit,
    though, probably no one in the world really wants to.  He warbles more tentatively
    than Mark Linkous, Jonathan Donahue, and Wayne Coyne combined, and as a result,
    listening to <i>Get There</i> is like watching a $7,000 Ming vase fall to the
    floor in slow motion: it's beautiful, it's fragile, and it's about to break.</p><p>
    
    Marque seems as though he's slowly coming to terms with the fact that he's not
    really a singer.  For one thing, many of the songs on his debut feature simple,
    easy-to-sing melodies that don't require a whole lot of range.  And, blessedly,
    he's backed by Joe Ferguson (who's pulled duty doing everything from engineering
    the Promise Ring to playing all kinds of instruments for Simon Joyner, Sam Rivers
    and dozens of others) on several tracks.  Ferguson, by himself, is not a hugely
    distinctive vocalist, but in the backing role he's given here, he adds a lot of
    spine to melodies that might otherwise collapse, borne on the back of a voice
    that's just not strong enough.</p><p>
    
    The dual vocals have roughly the same effect as Isaac Brock double-tracking
    himself on some of Modest Mouse's quietest material-- it's shaky but it does
    the trick.  And once you get past the frontman, you come across some richly
    detailed backing tracks, full of Fred Lonberg-Holm's humming cello, Steve
    Dorocke's muted pedal steel lines, and the stately drumming of Wilco's Glenn
    Kotche.  Indeed, there's an incredible amount of skilled instrumental interplay
    going on here, and it's a shame it's not supporting something stronger.</p><p>
    
    Marque himself isn't a bad guitarist by any measure, and when he and Boxhead
    Ensemble ringleader Michael Krassner duel on their acoustics, it provides for
    some of the album's most enjoyable moments.  The instrumental, ""Here Is What
    I've Been Trying to Tell You,"" brings this interplay to the fore over Adam
    Morganstern's programmed beat, providing a pleasant interlude and a needed
    respite from Marque's grating lead vocals.</p><p>
    
    Other musical highlights include ""Collage Made of Air,"" which takes the white-boy
    soul/funk that Lambchop so often ply as their blueprint, resulting in a breezy
    number with enough kick in its step to overcome the poorly delineated melody
    riding on top of it.  The sublime and the irritating do battle a number of times
    elsewhere, too. It's a weird juxtaposition to listen to Lonberg-Holm's rich,
    beautiful cello buzzing in the background of ""Windshield,"" contrasted against
    Marque trying to pick a fight with a melody five times his size.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, Marque's shortcomings as a performer get the best of him more
    often than not, and <i>Get There</i> suffers accordingly.  At barely a half-hour
    long, his debut offers a sketch of a talent that's still in the making-- one
    that might be best off offering his words to another singer.  Matt Marque has
    certainly surrounded himself with the right people to make an excellent record;
    perhaps next time he'll be able to iron out his personal wrinkles enough to
    carry his music to its fullest realization.</p></div>"|5113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5113-get-there/|5.7|Joe Tangari

Not the same New York PJ Harvey wailed about on
    <i>Stories from the City</i>, or the one Sonic Youth addressed with <i>NYC
    Ghosts &amp; Flowers</i>; one more akin to the lower east side after-hours retreats
    of Luna's <i>Penthouse</i> or Yo La Tengo's <i>I Can Hear the Heart Beating as
    One</i>.  It's both quiet and loud in a way that invokes flickering lights
    against the city sky at dusk.</p><p>
<i>Been Here and Gone</i> isn't as much sad as it is tired.  Maybe it was a
    long and busy day.  The air might be getting colder.  Maybe the seasons may have
    already changed.  There's a light on in the kitchen and a window cracked in the
    bedroom.  The Empire State Building rests on its side from the view on your
    pillow as you lay sleepless in the heat.  Thalia Zedek's weathered voice reflects
    it all.</p><p>
    
    A long way from her days spent with Come, Uzi, and Live Skull, <i>Been Here and
    Gone</i> seems the mature and reminiscent record of an aged career, like Joni
    Mitchell's <i>Both Sides Now</i> or Neil Young's <i>Harvest Moon</i>. Supposedly
    inspired by the cabaret-style shows Come played between their third and fourth
    records, this album grew as a result of popular response to her stripped-down
    solo shows.  On record, guitars, drums, piano, and violin play along, but may as
    well evaporate into the smoggy breeze, as the focal point at all times is Zedek's
    lulling voice.  Echoes of Patti Smith, the Geraldine Fibbers' Carla Bozulich, and
    Mecca Normal's Jean Smith curl from her throat, stark and patient, as if she
    were singing indie rock's torch song.  And maybe she is.</p><p>
<i>Been Here and Gone</i> sounds vintage but timeless, like an old photograph.
    And while neither groundbreaking nor post-whatever, Zedek captures moments like
    Kodak paper.  Vaguely psychedelic instrumentation opens ""Excommunications
    (Everybody Knows),"" a Leonard Cohen-style dirge (its subtitle seems an homage
    to one of his best known songs) that trudges woefully along, until the effects
    fade, leaving the song to end stark and bare.  ""Desanctified (Full Circle)"" works
    its charm with a see-sawing Dirty Three feel that's akin to green-faced
    sea-sickness.  Here, though, this isn't a bad thing; the song shows its teeth
    where many of the album's other tracks hold but a solemn gaze.</p><p>
    
    The record also features three piano-led songs, all of them covers.  Two of
    these, Gary Gogel's ""1926"" and Leonard Cohen's ""Dance Me to the End of Love,""
    work as a sort of center to the album, lightening the mood, and gradually
    bringing things closer until they're back in full view.  The final track, Luiz
    Bonfa's ""Manha de Carnaval"" is consummate while simultaneously welcoming, bringing
    closure to the <i>Been Here and Gone</i>'s long and insomnian New York night.
    It was best spent like this, anyway.</p></div>"|8945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8945-been-here-and-gone/|8.5|Andi Rowlands

Not scared, ya hear, but anxious. I am
    nervous about the dilapidated state of popular music, predominantly inspired by
    love and romance. Creativity is dying and sentimental rubbish is settling in,
    all inspired by the big L.  Thankfully, we can turn off MTV, get onto the
    Internet, and find a gold mine: there's an alternative to the triteness. And in
    a world where Wilco, of all bands, is dropped from a major label, independent
    music has become a surrogate mother. There is musical innovation and sincerity
    out there.</p><p>
    
    But where does the Reindeer Section fit into all of this?  Well, they've been
    deemed an indie supergroup, and their roster would appear to justify such a
    label with members from Mogwai, Belle and Sebastian, Arab Strap, Astrid, Snow
    Patrol, V-Twin, Mull Historical Society, Eva, and Hercules. The story goes that
    all of them were at a Lou Barlow gig in Glasgow when Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody
    suggested the idea: ""Everyone thought that it was a great idea but I'm sure they
    were thinking, 'Aye, right, Gary, whatever,' and that I'd forget about it when I
    sobered up. In fact, the next day I wrote the complete album."" Should we expect
    some mind-blowing material from this supergroup?</p><p>
    
    Not quite. Whereas the output of the typical supergroup collapses from the weight
    of creative tension, the presence of most of the Reindeer Section's members barely
    exceeds the level of a standard collaboration.  <i>Y'all Get Scared Now, Ya Hear!</i>
    debunks the supergroup designation with the first track, confirming that this is,
    for all intents and purposes, the project of Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody. ""Will
    You Please Be There for Me"" is a simple two-minute solo acoustic number vaguely
    resembling a simplified version of Badly Drawn Boy's ""Epitaph"" with all of the
    filtered flutter and bird noises replaced by straightforward white noise in the
    left channel. The first words we hear are, ""If I gave you my heart/ Would you
    give yours to me?,"" and the lyrical banality and romantic lamentations are
    sustained for the rest of the record against a backdrop that closely resembles
    Snow Patrol's acoustic moments. Lightbody writes in the liner notes that this
    entire record was written in one day and recorded in ten, and the lack of
    engagement shows.</p><p>
    
    But it's not all tedium. The next track, ""The Opening Taste,"" features gorgeous
    vocal harmony between Lightbody and Astrid's Charlie Clark. ""12 Hours It Takes
    Sometimes"" wouldn't have sounded out of place on the Court and Spark's <i>Ventura
    Whites</i> debut with a lulling tempo, a slight lilt, and a distant piano. ""Tout
    le Monde"" stands out in its oddity; it's based on a driving guitar riff played by
    Mogwai's John Cummings that's looped alongside shifting harmonies (some repeating
    ""anywhere in the world"") while others just moan. Processed drum loops enter,
    along with timbaleze played by Belle and Sebastian's Richard Colburn. It turns
    out to be a bizarre, yet homogenous, dance number that's satisfying but undeniably
    out of place.</p><p>
    
    Truthfully, I bought this record because the juxtaposition of Mogwai, Belle and
    Sebastian, and Arab Strap made an intriguing concept, but it never comes together.
    Mogwai's Cummings is the only member of any of these bands with a substantial
    presence here, playing guitar on 8 of the 14 tracks. And even then, his
    performances are muted by the ubiquity of Lightbody. Arab Strap's Aidan Moffat
    shows up once on ""Nytol,"" a song he lyrically co-write, but ultimately, the
    track comes off as a lightweight and lighthearted Arab Strap clone.  Moffat's
    intonation, ""I think it must be the soap that you use,"" proves to be the lyrical
    apex of the record.  Belle and Sebastian members Colburn and Mick Cooke appear
    on only four tracks total (but never simultaneously) playing percussion and
    brass, respectively.</p><p>
    
    Which leads to the glimpse of light on <i>Y'all Get Scared Now</i>.  ""Sting,""
    easily the album's best track, features Cooke playing Spanish-inflected muted
    lines on trumpet and flugelhorn, Cummings on guitar, and layers of harmonies in
    a coda that proves to be simultaneously compelling and hopeful for the future of
    this group. You see, Gary Lightbody's already written another record for the
    Reindeer Section, including one track exclusively for Aidan Moffat. To which
    Moffat responded, ""Apparently, Gary's written a track for me already, so he's
    roped me in for that. It's that northern Irish accent, it gets me every time.""
    Maybe you should get back to sadness, Aidan.</p></div>"|6745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6745-yall-get-scared-now-ya-hear/|6.4|Christopher F. Schiel

Her name was Betty, and she told him all about what the
    kids were listening to.  Being a singer herself, she had some connection to the
    inside world of pop and soul, but mostly, she was just a lot younger than him,
    and was probably instinctively more drawn to that music than Miles was.  It's
    not as if Miles was completely out of touch with popular trends, but on tour and
    in the studio as frequently as he was, one could hardly blame him for receiving
    information second-hand.</p><p>
    Betty told him all about Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and the Fifth Dimension
    (hopefully in that order), and he was keen to investigate the new sounds.  Years
    later he would brag about being able to put together a rock band that would blow
    all the others away, but he approached the idiom cautiously and methodically at
    first.  Additionally, Miles was getting insider info from his drummer, Tony
    Williams.  Tony was younger even than Betty Mabry, and although he'd come of age
    deep inside one of the most popular bands in jazz (even if jazz's popularity
    wasn't what it had been ten years previous), he had his finger very much on the
    pulse of hip new music.  Tony had especially enjoyed the new funk from James
    Brown and the boogaloo grooves being played by Jimmy McGriff and Richard ""Groove""
    Holmes' bands.  Betty and Tony were playing a key role for Miles Davis in the
    late 60s, even beyond their personal and performing ones.</p><p>
<i>The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions</i> release details a six-month stretch
    in 1968-69 when the various advisors in Miles' life would see their seeds sprout
    into fauna so full of life and outrageous fertility that the face of his idiom
    would be forever changed.  Of course, the final product of all this investigation
    and experimentation has been the subject of countless essays on Miles' genius,
    but it bears closer inspection to reveal that the trumpeter didn't just up and
    create this music out of thin air.  He spent months in the studio rehearsing on
    tape, midwifing his ideas.  In late '68, Miles was a painter using one canvas to
    try and retry his masterpiece, continually repainting over areas where, though
    the ideas were fresh and the colors vibrant, the concept was yet immature.</p><p>
    As a palette, Miles chose only the best primaries from two continents.  At the
    time, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, and Herbie Hancock were mainstays from his
    second great quintet.  Bassist Ron Carter had become so busy with sessions in
    New York that Miles had to find a replacement.  In between gigs in England, he
    saw Dave Holland's band opening for Bill Evans.  Miles was immediately struck by
    the young bassist, and sent word via Philly Jo Jones and his manager (Miles had
    the best connections) that he wanted Dave.  Elsewhere, when it became apparent
    Hancock was going to have trouble making a recording date, Williams recommended
    the young Boston native Chick Corea as a replacement.  This quintet (Davis,
    Shorter, Williams, Holland and Corea) produced the first tunes on this release
    in September 1968.</p><p>
    ""Mademoiselle Mabry"" is a sprawling ode to both Miles' new girl and Hendrix's
    ""The Wind Cries Mary.""  Miles had started using electric keyboards in the studio
    almost exclusively by that time, and Corea's relatively conservative figures
    (when they aren't directly quoting the Hendrix tune), are the dominant timbre
    in this piece at first.  He hadn't picked up the Fender Rhodes piano that would
    color almost every tune Miles performed thereafter, and the primitive sounds
    produced here betray the band's uncertainty about where the tune (or their sound)
    was going.  Davis takes the first solo, similar to his exploratory efforts on
    <i>Miles in the Sky</i> earlier that year, over a non-groove from Williams' toms
    and Holland's steady, if rather static, low-end line.  One of the reasons sets
    like this are great is that you really get a feeling for the musicians' progress
    during that time, and if this tune is any indication, things had only just begun
    to get interesting.</p><p>
    ""Frelon Brun"" gives a much better idea of the revolutionary sounds ahead.
    Williams wastes no time in hammering out a hard funk break from the kit, and
    Corea had apparently already learned the importance of the repetitive chordal
    vamp to this music.  Davis takes a short solo, as if testing the waters, which
    is followed by Shorter's seemingly more confident strides in funky acid soul.
    The music actually ends up closer to what the band played after <i>Bitches Brew</i>
    than anything on <i>In a Silent Way</i>.</p><p>
    Two months later, Miles reconvened with the same musicians, adding Herbie Hancock
    on Rhodes to form a sextet, to begin the next phase of the trip.  The band played
    music closer to Miles' vision on ""Two Faced"": mystical, impressionistic
    soundscapes courtesy of the two-keyboard attack, subtle, though insistent
    drumming from Williams, and a by-then typically moaning, weary head covered by
    Davis and Shorter.  The band was also not afraid of stretching the tunes out to
    10, 15, or 20 minutes if it meant they'd find something useful along the way.
    Miles (with the help of producer Teo Macero) had discovered tape edits from
    progressive pop records of the time (<i>Sgt. Pepper</i> being a chief influence),
    and this tune, similar to ""Shhh/Peaceful"" and ""In a Silent Way/It's About That
    Time,"" was constructed from several stop/start fragments.</p><p>
    Later the same month, Miles found yet another missing ingredient in keyboardist
    (and über-influence on the sound of all resulting jazz-rock fusion) Joe Zawinul.
    The two men had known each other for several years prior to these sessions, but
    Miles could only admire the Austrian's playing from afar.  Zawinul had made great
    strides in uniting jazz and soul with Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderley's band in the
    mid-60s, even scoring a pop hit with ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.""  He also brought an
    earthy sense of melody and classicism to the mix, and would ultimately become a
    major architect for the sound of Miles' band.</p><p>
    ""Splashdown,"" a previously unreleased piece of tense, Rhodes-led jazz-funk,
    was recorded with the first three-keyboard version of the band.  However,
    Zawinul's influence wasn't really apparent until sessions from a couple of days
    later, when the band played two of his compositions: ""Ascent"" and the subsequent
    concert staple, ""Directions.""  The former seemingly caught the band in transition,
    with its theretofore-unprecedented use of tonal clusters and rootless ""comping""
    from the keyboards, and an absence of any drum pattern at all, save an odd
    tambourine pulse.  ""Directions"" was another story altogether, as the band busts
    out of the peaceful into the wild.  This was the most ""rock"" Miles Davis had
    sounded like up to that point, and the two versions of the tune on this set are
    very similar to what Miles' concerts would sound like from '69 through the early
    70s.  Also of note on this session is that drummer Jack DeJohnette made his first
    appearance with a Miles Davis band in the studio, lending his distinct,
    high-energy stomp to the proceedings.</p><p>
    The band went on the road for a few months after that, and returned to the studio
    in February 1969.  More changes: John McLaughlin had been recruited on guitar
    (another Tony Williams recommendation), and Williams had returned on drums.
    This time around, Miles was looking for what he called a ""groove album.""  The
    strategy was that the band would play a tune (on this session, ""Shhh/Peaceful""
    and ""In a Silent Way""), based on charts, but were free to explore what regions
    the performance yielded to them.  Afterwards, Miles and Teo would evaluate the
    pieces, and form the ""groove"" in Miles' head from whatever was on tape.</p><p>
    The original, previously unreleased version of ""Shhh/Peaceful"" from that session
    will shock most people accustomed to the legendary <i>In a Silent Way</i> version.
    First of all, there's an exposition and melodic theme that was completely
    discarded in the proper version.  Also, the famous robotic hi-hat pattern doesn't
    even begin until almost five minutes in.  One of the surprises (some might even
    say disappointments) of this set is the realization that this music wasn't just
    the product of Miles' muse; there were hours of sessions and rehearsals before
    the band, Miles and Teo discovered what it was they were looking for.  The humble
    beginnings of this tune still have much in common with straight jazz, though with
    a markedly progressive bent.</p><p>
    The same session yielded two versions of ""In a Silent Way.""  The first is very
    different to what ended up on the album, with a faux-bossanova beat and Holland's
    light-footed bassline supporting the classic melody line.  The second version is
    the version that was used on the album, with McLaughlin's heavenly solo statement
    of the main theme, and Miles' delicate answer.  The band also performed ""It's
    About That Time"" (definitely a fruitful afternoon) in what was essentially the
    final version, complete with tape edits and loops compiled by Teo.</p><p>
    Two days later, Miles was back in the studio.  He had a couple of new pieces,
    ""The Ghetto Walk"" and ""Early Minor,"" neither of which ended up on <i>In a Silent
    Way</i>.  The first tune is a hard funk almost-blues featuring Joe Chambers
    laying down a slinky groove on drums, while McLaughlin, Shorter and Miles give
    up equally subversive solos.  Most interesting is the middle section trip-down,
    wherein the ghost of the session two days prior sneaks in with a little
    atmospheric feather float.  ""Early Minor"" is another Zawinul original that's
    indicative of the kind of hyper-impressionism he would play (with Shorter) with
    Weather Report shortly after making <i>Bitches Brew</i> with Miles.  It's also
    confusing as to just why this didn't make the cut for the original <i>In a Silent
    Way</i> release, because it features similar cascading Rhodes figures, and very
    nice, gentle pulse keeping by Chambers.</p><p>
    The set ends with the LP versions of ""Shhh/Peaceful"" and ""In a Silent Way/It's
    About That Time.""  Miles fans didn't get to hear everything that came in between
    this album and its predecessor, so the sessions documented on this collection
    will make the leap from the cautious dabbling in rock textures of <i>Miles in
    the Sky</i> and <i>Filles de Kilimanjaro</i> to the full-blown jazz-opera of
    <i>Bitches Brew</i>.  These recordings seem a lot more logically arranged and
    planned.  This is good and bad: while few people would doubt the genius of Miles
    Davis as a player, composer and bandleader, it's evident that he was running on
    blind faith more than once during that time, and that he was learning on the go
    as much as his sidemen were.</p><p>
    Part of the mystique surrounding this album, for
    me, has always been that it seemed to come out of nowhere, like a beacon of
    uncanny originality and visionary foresight.  Apparently, it did have roots, and
    while the music will always be some of my favorite from Miles, I can't honestly
    say that seeing the blueprints for his magic translates to the same sheer joy as
    did the end results.  But, it's still magic music, and it's still Miles.  The
    worst thing you could ever say about a set like this is that it's almost too
    educational, and of course, that's not really a criticism, is it?</p></div>"|2199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2199-the-complete-in-a-silent-way-sessions/|9.5|Dominique Leone

Blatantly fan-milking and time-stalling,
    they rarely hold more than a passing charm. But I'm often a sucker for them all
    the same-- a connoisseur, you might even say. They have an aesthetic all their
    own, I mean, if you want to call it that, what with their near-obligatory guitar
    and drum solos, sing-alongs, and between-song banter.</p><p>
    From B.B. King's <i>Live at Cook County Jail</i> and James Brown's <i>Live at the
    Apollo</i> to 70s rock classics like <i>Frampton Comes Alive</i> and Rush's <i>A
    Show of Hands</i> (a cassette of which rests in a shoebox under my bed at this
    very moment), live albums can offer a glimpse into the true heart of a band or
    artist. Of course, like some of the above-mentioned albums above, it might not be
    a pretty sight. The truth can be ugly.</p><p>
    As someone who owns every Songs: Ohia release and who has attended about a dozen
    of the band's live shows, it's safe to say I'm already a certified fan, which
    makes me the perfect chump for a live disc. But if I imagine for a moment that
    I've never heard Songs: Ohia before and <i>Mi Sei Apparso Come un Fantasma</i>
    (Italian for ""You come to me as a ghost"") came as my introduction to the band,
    it would make a fan out of me right quick.</p><p>
    Recorded in Modena, Italy in September of 2000, <i>Fantasma</i> offers a better
    introduction to Songs: Ohia than the last couple of proper albums, which seemed
    like transitional or exploratory releases. But then again, Songs: Ohia is a band
    in constant flux; what began as Will Oldham-like ramblings on their self-titled
    1997 debut had become a Berlin-period Bowie-inspired project by the time <i>Ghost
    Tropic</i> saw release last year.</p><p>
    Songs: Ohia has essentially always been the vision of singer/songwriter Jason
    Molina and whoever else happened to be hanging out with him at the time, but
    <i>Fantasma</i> is the statement of a full-fledged working rock band, with the
    additional guitarist, bassist, and drummer fleshing out Molina's skeletal song
    structures without diminishing their power. The spotlight, though, as always,
    remains on Molina's powerful voice and lyrics, which at their best sound bleak,
    mournful, hopeful, and reconciliatory all at once.</p><p>
    Five of eight songs here are untitled and as-yet unreleased elsewhere. That alone
    raises this release above the gratuitous repackaging-of-favorites cliché that too
    often makes up the live album experience. The untitled album-opener is probably
    the best song on <i>Fantasma</i>. Riding a halting riff and minimal snare crack,
    the song lurches along with almost unbearable weight, slowly building to Molina's
    opening verse: ""All those days, we don't have days like that left to us."" After
    ruminating on the body's ultimate demise without treading into maudlin or cliché
    territory, Molina and company rave it up in Crazy Horse fashion. Overall, it's
    about as classic a Songs: Ohia song as there is.</p><p>
    The sixth track, also untitled, is another standout. Following a similar path as
    the opener, in terms of starting out slow and simple and then proceeding to a
    distortion-fueled outro, it shows off Molina's ability to craft a guitar riff so
    simple and powerful that you wonder why no one thought of it before. Lead
    guitarist Dan Sullivan's role is incredibly pronounced here, too, adding an
    bright, angular guitar riff that's equal parts Steve Malkmus and Neil Young.
    The only gratuitous moment comes with the next track, where the band gets all
    Dead-like with an intro jam that goes on a little long. But by song's end, they
    pull it together, and Sullivan's eerie ""For What It's Worth""-sounding riff ends
    the songs on a powerful, if somber, note.</p><p>
    The three previously-released songs-- ""Tigress"" and ""Being in Love"" from 2000's
    <i>The Lioness</i>, and ""Cabwaylingo"" from the debut-- are reinterpreted enough
    to make them interesting in their own right, and not just in relation to the
    originals.  This applies less to the former two, probably because the band was
    touring behind the album those songs are on, and not enough time had passed for
    them to change much.  But the latter, the album-closing ""Cabwaylingo,"" is given
    a Dylan-esque reworking, with an extended intro and a completely different middle
    section, lyrically.  It's a little treat for the longtime fans who've been paying
    attention all along: a convention of the live album Molina just couldn't bring
    himself to break away from. It sure beats a drum solo.</p></div>"|7337.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7337-mi-sei-apparso-come-un-fantasma/|8.4|Jason Nickey

    the Canadian avant-garde label Alien 8, couldn't have set the roster up better.
    Tomas Jirku's <i>Immaterial</i> looks to the near imperceptible for inspiration.
    Though not widely recognized, Jirku's recording career has neatly suggested that
    he would soon release a genre-defining set.</p><p>
    Having worked out his M.O. on the MP3 site NoType, Jirku released his sophomore
    album, last year's <i>Variants</i>, for Alien 8. That album collected a month's
    worth of clicks, pop, and righteous dub rhythms. The step from the suggestive
    <i>Variants</i> to the blatant club styles of his next release, <i>Sequins</i>,
    was a easy one. <i>Sequins</i>, released on the doyen of the click dance scene,
    Force Inc, ensured that Jirku would be admired in the same light as Mathias
    Schaffhäuser, Wolfgang Voigt, and Thomas Brinkmann. While it's true that none of
    the nine <i>Sequins</i> tracks would make it into Sasha and Digweed's sets, I'd
    not be baffled to find one in Andrew Weatherall's challenging selections.</p><p>
<i>Immaterial</i> shies away from maximum club exposure, though those mechanics
    are detectable. Four lengthy tracks named after subatomic particles begin the
    electron haze with Jirku slowly introducing classic Chain Reaction dub elements
    into the space. The signature tinkles, pops, and curved white noise are all
    abundant. Jirku maintains such immense control of these vaporous elements that
    his music seems to halt the flow of time, as only the finest dub can.</p><p>
    With such discreet and attentive sounds as these, every reaction is going to be
    unique. To me, Jirku is investigating the Brownian motion of dust settling or
    how things come out in the wash. <i>Immaterial</i> is fixated on these processes.
    Jirku puts forth little effort to make each of the four tracks distinctive, and
    in fact, by using the sound of running water as a segue between each, he compels
    the listener to treat each track as part of a greater whole. In this regard,
    Jirku allies himself directly with Vladislav Delay, the Finnish minimal master,
    whose 2000 release, <i>Anima</i>, was a sixty-five minute exploration of minimal
    rhythm on Mille Plateaux, Force Inc's even more experimental parent label.</p><p>
    Like <i>Anima</i>, <i>Immaterial</i> can be extremely demanding if the listener
    is intent on attending to each detail. While hardly an intellectual response,
    I've found that I've best appreciated the record by contradicting its demanding
    nature and treating it as an inconsequential environment.  <i>Immaterial</i>
    transcends the piquant ambiguity of its title. However playfully Jirku tempts me
    to write this record off as inconsequential fluff, the album has a nebulous,
    evanescent beauty that keeps luring me back into its gaseous extent.</p></div>"|4264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4264-immaterial/|7.5|Paul Cooper

    from his acting in any of a number of underrated independent films, to his work
    with Jean-Michel Basquiat in the short-lived New York band Gray; from the writing
    at his self-maintained website, to his twisted directorial debut <i>Buffalo 66</i>--
    and you'll always find something a bit off-kilter. Of course, it's in this very
    awkwardness that Gallo's appeal lies.</p><p>
    In the aforementioned film-- parts of which are admittedly autobiographical--
    Gallo plays a loser named Billy who returns, upon his release from prison, to his
    hometown. On his first day back, he kidnaps a young girl, takes her to his
    parents' house for dinner, forces her to pretend she's his wife, and then
    proceeds to wander around town with her trailing closely behind. Over the
    course of the film, Billy realizes that there's nothing for him in this town,
    that he's every bit as lost as he'd been before jail. He recognizes the girl
    as his possible salvation, but finds himself too petrified to act upon this
    realization. Gallo wrote, directed, scored, and starred in the film; this
    hands-on approach no doubt the cause of much of its emotional resonance. He
    approaches <i>When</i>, his solo musical debut, in much the same way. Not only
    is Gallo the sole writer, performer and producer credited here, but his songs
    are imbued with the same emotional nakedness that made <i>Buffalo 66</i> so
    engrossing.</p><p>
    Throughout the album, but on ""Honey Bunny"" in particular, Gallo appears to be
    mocking traditional lovesong lyrics. ""Huh-uh-nee Buh-huh-nee,"" he sings in a
    faux-Prekopian swagger, dragging out each syllable, pausing between each pair as
    though to decide which romantic cliché best fits his intentions: ""My Bay-ay-bee...
    girl... friend."" Later, on ""Laura,"" he repeats the titular figure's name a few
    dozen times, growing more desperate with each go-round. The sheer vapidity of
    these lyrics gives <i>When</i> the feel of a very private affair, like we're
    standing outside the door to Gallo's room while he sits on his bed inside,
    guitar in hand, wallowing in self-pity.</p><p>
    This voyeuristic effect is reminiscent
    of much of Smog's earlier work, though the means by which the two artists achieve
    it couldn't be further apart. The ingenuity here is not in the lyrics, but
    entirely in their delivery. Listening to <i>When</i>, one can't help but wonder
    if this is how Andy Kaufmann's audiences felt. As Gallo speak-sings, ""Goodnight
    baby/ Sleep tight here with me/ We can lay in the bed, you and me/ And I won't
    go away or leave you alone/ Sweetie-pie/ Baby/ Sleep tight/ Here with me,"" on
    ""Apple Girl,"" we're left scratching our heads, wondering if the effect is
    intentional or not.</p><p>
    I can only assume, based on Gallo's work as a filmmaker and his arrangements on
    some of <i>When</i>'s more ambitious tracks, that it is. Gallo may be
    self-indulgent, but he's certainly not oblivious. ""I Wrote This Song for the Girl
    Paris Hilton,"" the disc's opener, begins with a short looped sample of an
    unwavering horn note, with guitar and drums in the background. Slowly, Gallo
    builds a song out of other sampled instruments-- a guitar here, an organ there--
    piling them atop the relentless three-second foundation. The arrangement is
    clunky in the same way that a U.S. Maple song is, but this doesn't diminish its
    beauty. If anything, it serves as allegory for a mind we're led to assume is
    somewhat shaky and nervous. Consider it an early warning that the songs which
    follow are going to be a bit off kilter. The instrumentation is lush as can be,
    while the ever-present loop has a lulling effect that prepares listeners for the
    slow but beautiful ride through Gallo's fragile psyche to come.</p><p>
    When he samples an old recording of vibraphones on ""Was,"" it's not the melody,
    but the actual sound that affects. Gallo's placement of the flat, faded, somewhat
    muted old recording over his own full, lush guitar strokes makes for an
    intriguing parallel. The sample, much like his character in <i>Buffalo 66</i>
    and-- we're drawn to assume-- Gallo himself, doesn't quite belong.  Yet, there's
    an undeniable beauty to the unlikely pairing.</p><p>
    Musically, most of <i>When</i> is sparse, reminiscent of the more haunting
    moments on Archer Prewitt's <i>Gerroa Songs</i> or a more subtle, less dynamic
    Bedhead. A lightly picked guitar and barely audible bass make up the bulk of the
    accompaniment to Gallo's nearly androgynous crooning, with the occasional string
    section that fades out as quickly as it came in. The result, when added to the
    often repetitive vocals is captivating, almost hypnotic.  But once again, Gallo
    proves he's more aware than he lets on. On the next track, ""My Beautiful White
    Dog,"" a gently plucked guitar continues to wander aimlessly, but it does so over
    a dirty old drum loop and an ominous string section which serves as a wake-up
    call, yanking the listener to attention after the calm opening tracks.</p><p>
    There's no denying that <i>When</i> is an exercise is self-indulgence. Much like
    <i>Bufallo 66</i>, it's an effort that, while deserving of respect and maybe even
    a bit of envy, is riddled with flaws. Just as some of the characters in his film
    lacked a backstory or a sense of purpose, so does <i>When</i>. Though gorgeous
    and inexplicably well-crafted, it lacks scope; far too content to swim in circles
    in a pool of Gallo's emotions to ever strike ground that truly resonates. And
    even though their ambiguity often lends the lyrics much of their weight, it'd be
    nice to hear Gallo take a swing at something with a bit more depth than, ""I'm
    always sad when I'm lonely/ I'm always sad.""</p><p>
    Still, <i>When</i> is a gorgeous collection of songs which paint an undeniably
    clear picture of their creator.  If, with his next project-- be it music, film
    or something else-- Gallo attempts to broaden his range, to understand something
    besides himself, there's no telling what heights he might reach.</p></div>"|3384.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3384-when/|7.3|David M. Pecoraro

    And it's all... good.""</em>
    
    --Biggie Smalls, ""Juicy""</p><p>
    
    ""H to the Izzo"" wasn't a summer jam for me.  No TV, sadly, means no BET.  I'm
    too far from ATL to get good radio, and the only thing bumping out the trunk at
    stoplights was that fucking White Stripes album.  I was so deprived that when
    Nas pondered if Jay-Z might be ""H to the izzo/ M to the izzo,"" I didn't even
    get the damned reference.  Approaching a Jay-Z album in a cultural vacuum is a
    dangerous venture-- something I haven't done since his 1996 debut, <em>Reasonable
    Doubt</em>-- and my hopes were a lot lower for this new one, which was rumored to
    be short on bigger-than-Jesus superproducers and entirely free of perpetual
    Roc-a-Fella sidemen Beans and Bleek (both of whom I've come to like far better
    than Jay himself).  Honestly, I was expecting mediocre shit-- the worst kind of
    boredom that comes with return-to-my-roots formalism, or maybe a chorus or two
    from a children's musical.  What I got was the plush defining statement from
    hip-hop's last great personality.</p><p>
<em>The Blueprint</em> is possibly the least sonically inventive hip-hop chart
    topper in years-- stunning and captivating for sure, but still loungily
    comfortable enough to sleep to.  The songs are spare, but the care of assembly
    holds any leftover interest that Jay isn't already commanding.  The unexpected
    flourishes are subtly beneficial, like the fanfare that sneaks in at the end of
    ""All I Need,"" or the incredible clap-clap break of ""Heart of the City."" Retro
    soul samples are dull white, picked clean of lint and sanitized.  They're wielded
    like pieces of a glitch track around Jay's words, coming in at all the right
    moments and corporealizing into a clipped skeleton to drape his ego on.
    Disregarding ""Takeover"" (which is a separate world, anyway), he's left behind
    all the dirty funk of so many jams past; too powerful, too rich, too fucking
    refined to even be touched by such filthiness.  It's easy-listening because his
    life is almost entirely easy living, and his only nuisances (bitch-ass rappers
    and the media, naturally) are shortly addressed in two quick jabs: laid-back dis
    track and Eminem guest shot.</p><p>
    
    ""Takeover"" is the dis track.  Casually flowing over a marching bassline and
    carbonated harpsichord flourishes, Jay slowly and confidently explains to you
    that Nas and Mobb Deep's Prodigy are the most wack, fake-ass thugs in the
    universe, and how he must destroy them.  After it ends, you realize he was
    simply performing an obligation-- responding to a glove slap that's far beneath
    him, but entirely within his capacity to address.  The abrupt final verse is
    the topper as Jay laughingly exhorts that, ""All you other cats throwin' shots at
    Jigga/ You only get half a bar, fuck y'all, niggaz.""  How does Jadakiss even
    begin to respond at that?</p><p>
    
    As for the rest, well, there's nothing really awful (the cringeworthy track or
    two that seems to lurk at the end of every Jay-Z album is notably absent), but
    there's nothing really shocking, either.  But the other tracks are so
    forward-moving and hallucinatory that even Timbaland can't stab his way out of
    the haze.  What holds it together is Jigga's overwhelming self-assuredness--
    the kind of justified confidence you can imagine witnessing from a world
    conqueror or cult leader.  When the pitchshifted chorus of ""U Don't Know""
    exclaims, ""You don't know... what you're doing,"" Jay is quick to respond: ""Sure,
    I do.""  He then goes on to casually add up his yearly earnings and ponder the
    total like Mos circa <i>Mathematics</i> if possessed by Gordon Gekko, and you
    realize that this is for real: Shawn Carter finally entirely synchronized with
    the Jigga-man rapping persona for an entire album.</p><p>
    
    Gradually, the other tracks start to make sense; ""Hola Hovito"" is a Swizz Beatz
    eulogy with Roger Troutman shouting nonsense from the bathroom. ""Jigga That
    Nigga"" is all the lovely French females from ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" asking him to
    kick it 1998-style once again. ""Heart of the City,"" possibly the best song that
    actually works in the style of the album, deftly grinds with tiptoeing smoothness
    like a bugged-out Cluster track while Jay makes a convincing case for holding it
    down six summers straight. ""Niggaz pray and pray on my downfall/ But every time
    I hit the ground I bounce up like round ball.""</p><p>
    
    Bouncing up means coming down, and he does for ""Renegade,"" teaming with the
    world's <i>other</i> greatest MC to whine about the perils of being the world's
    greatest MCs and all.  I shouldn't have to mention the brilliant rhymes, but
    (surprisingly, after a few bombs on the d12 album) it's almost ridiculous how
    good Eminem's beat is-- strings, synth and ""Good Vibrations""-style theremin
    tones roll easy like 1987.  After that, Jay puts focus in full on his rep,
    bigging up <em>Reasonable Doubt</em> more times than every other cut of his career
    combined.  Jay's always been moving towards abolishing the hardcore production
    style that originally went with being gangsta, but the funny thing about this is
    how overwhelmingly post-gangsta he is-- the fruits of a thug life that was too
    long ago to dwell on.</p><p>
    
    ""If I ain't better than B.I.G./ I'm the closest one,"" he says on ""Hola Hovito,""
    and that's an important clarification; when Puffy and Easy Mo Bee were laying pop
    beats under Biggie's real-life crime stories, the old school heads complained
    about how the rugged and rough aesthetic was on the way out.  But ""Juicy"" shut
    the haters up by simply explaining that Biggie was pop only because he didn't
    need that dirty funk-rock life anymore.  And so, while frat boys went buckwild
    for screeching thugs like Cypress Hill and Onyx who boasted of a running crime
    rate, Biggie had already gotten over it and just wanted to live his life in peace.
    But everyone knows what actually happened, and after his crime style finally
    caught up with him, the new generation of pop thug was ushered in.  After
    Biggie's death, no one comes closer than Jay-Z.</p></div>"|4216.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4216-the-blueprint/|8.7|Ethan P.

    semi-mythic history, a genuine Guitar God for a leader, and most important of
    all, a seemingly endless supply of side projects and related bands to fret over.
    Over the past year or so, a flood of releases from these ""Japanese psychedelic
    speed freaks"" has been unleashed to quench the thirst of rabid completists--
    live albums, reissues, vinyl-only releases, etc.-- it can all be a bit daunting
    for the uninitiated. It's the kind of thing that kept me away from the Fall for
    so long, and to my ultimate regret once I finally took the plunge into their vast
    and intimidating discography.</p><p>
    
    On this disc, Makoto Kawabata, the leader of Acid Mothers Temple, collaborates
    with Richard Youngs, a Scottish songwriter, sonic experimenter, sometimes
    librarian, and vegetarian cooking columnist probably best known for his musical
    partnerships with Simon Wickham-Smith, which often result in Dead C-ish noise
    sculptures. But he's also known to take a much more hermetic stance, composing
    such minimalist statements as ""Sapphie"" and ""Advent,"" the latter of which was
    recorded with only guitar and kazoo accompaniment.</p><p>
    
    On paper, this Kawabata/Youngs pairing has all the making of a all-out aural
    assault.  The easiest path they could have taken would have been for Youngs to
    record some ear-splitting, distorted garble and have it shipped to Kawabata who
    would superimpose an afternoon's worth of blistering guitar solos over it.  And
    even though this record was a long-distance affair, Kawabata and Youngs did the
    right thing: they decided to listen to one another and shoot for subtlety over
    brute force.</p><p>
    
    Youngs typically lays the foundation on these compositions, adopting one of his
    more meditative moods. Building upon autoharp, organ, or distantly droning tape
    sounds which constantly shift and realign, Kawabata fingerpicks his way back to
    Youngs' home turf, often recalling such British folkies as Bert Jansch or John
    Martyn. He slowly dwells upon an inner theme, never high-jacking the songs with
    his guitar for his own display.  Youngs adds vocals on two of the five tracks,
    sometimes sounding oddly like Robert Pollard, other times like a more embittered
    Roger Waters.</p><p>
    
    None of the tracks are titled; they're differentiated only by numbers and bars
    of different colors and lengths. The first track is the most traditionally
    song-oriented piece: a far off autoharp underpins Kawabata's bright, rollicking
    flat-picked steel-stringed acoustic work as Youngs sings about how, ""There's so
    much beauty now,"" in a heartbreakingly honest voice that can't be denied. The
    least accessible track is the second, which takes a dense swirl of autoharp and
    guitar notes and slowly submerges them in an organ drone that rises over the
    course of 12 minutes.</p><p>
    
    But, all told, this is far from the difficult music you might expect from these
    two; my attention never wavered over its 42-minute running time. Admittedly, it
    would be a stretch to call this release essential, but it would be sad if music
    this good was confined to the collections of Acid Mothers Temple completists.
    It's much more suited to open-minded folk aficionados or even fans of electronic
    ambient and trance.</p></div>"|4393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4393-makoto-kawabata-and-richard-youngs/|7.9|Jason Nickey

I gave up on organized religion a long time
    ago, so Christmas basically seems like just a big, over-commercialized holiday
    designed to deplete your savings and raise your blood pressure in the process.
    I mean, I love the light displays and seeing my family and all that, but there's
    something about the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day that just
    feels incredibly empty to me.  But beyond that, I think what I hate is the
    darkness.</p><p>
    
    Being on Daylight Savings Time here in New England means that the sun goes down
    around 4:00 p.m., and it drives me crazy.  Walking back from class at 6:00 with
    a stiff, cold wind in my face and the sun nowhere to be seen, it's easy to see
    why bears hibernate during the winter-- it's probably the best way to cope
    emotionally with the winter months.
    
    So into this mindset enter the Lilac Time's sixth album, the second since their
    reunion in 1998.  The Lilacs' last album, 1999's aptly titled <i>Looking for a
    Day in the Night</i>, fit this time of year for me fairly well.  It was a
    well-constructed folk record full of mournful music and mostly hopeful lyrical
    themes, and it radiated a kind of sorrowful warmth that made me forget what time
    of year it was.  But if that album found them looking for the day, then it's
    fair to say that <i>Lilac6</i> shows them finding it.</p><p>
    
    The thematic change is immediately apparent from the title of the first song,
    ""Dance Out of the Shadows.""  The Lilac Time ride out into the light on richly
    strummed acoustics, with head Lilac Stephen Duffy singing about middle age and
    the necessary lifestyle changes that come with the territory.  ""This Morning""
    follows, and makes it readily apparent that the thematic shift isn't the only
    one present.  <i>Lilac6</i> is a much more musically upbeat album as well, and
    features a crop of enjoyable, summery pop songs that are hard to argue with in
    the middle of winter.</p><p>
    
    ""This Morning"" sports a fluid, Motown-inspired bassline and dueling slide guitar
    and pedal steel lines.  Second vocalist Claire Worrall is more prominent on this
    record than she was on the last one, handling the chorus beautifully and
    harmonizing seamlessly with Duffy.  More obviously summer-themed is the excellent
    ""Jeans and Summer,"" a rocking little tune that nods to ""Louie Louie"" in the
    chorus before slipping into the catchy verse melody.  The backing vocals and
    jangling guitars recall early REM, while the vocal round of exuberant ""bah-bah's""
    that end the song evoke pre-<i>Pet Sounds</i> Beach Boys.</p><p>
    
    Other uptempo songs lean away from sway back into the moody territory that the
    band plies so well, like ""Entourage,"" with its subtle French accordion accompanying
    lines like, ""I only love you when I'm drunk/ I'm alcoholic,"" and, ""I'm through
    with morality/ Can I sleep with your wife?""  Perhaps the band's greatest mood
    enhancer is the pedal steel of Melvin Duffy (no relation to brothers Nick and
    Stephen).  His craft on the instrument is highly developed, and he's able to
    slip it into any context the band creates for him seamlessly.  Sometimes, his
    playing has the country-ish quality the instrument is known for (""My Forest
    Brown,"" for instance), but for the most part, he manages to subvert the steel's
    stereotypical sound with richly melodic playing.</p><p>
    
    His steel guitar holds a playful dialogue with Duffy and Worrall's harmonies on
    ""I Want to Be Your Man,"" a gently loping song stuffed full of finger-picked
    guitars and restrained percussion.  The song gives way to one of the album's two
    Nick Duffy instrumentals, the rhythmic, darkly lyrical ""Jupe Longue.""
    Interlocking guitars swirl like flamenco dancers over dark accordion and organ
    chords, and the result is a strangely carnival-esque song.  Unfortunately, the
    other instrumental, album closer ""June's Buffalo,"" isn't as engaging, plowing
    over urgently strummed acoustic guitar with an ugly accordion tone and a cheap,
    vaguely Caribbean rhythm.  The steel drum sound at the conclusion may or may not
    be real, but it hardly matters, because the average listener will be working so
    hard to tune out what they're hearing that they won't notice one way or the
    other.</p><p>
    
    It's too bad the album ends on such a negative note, because what precedes that
    is mostly engaging folk-rock that somehow manages a much broader appeal than most
    folk recordings.  Part of this broad appeal lies in the fact that Stephen Duffy
    is a pop musician at heart-- an original member of Duran Duran (he left before
    they got big) and the man responsible for the mid-80s synth-pop smash ""Kiss Me""
    as Tin Tin.  Here, he's managed to take both of his tendencies and write a batch
    of songs that sit nicely somewhere between the two extremes.</p><p>
    
    It makes for a record that sometimes feels a little too much like its head is in
    two different places, but ultimately, it holds together well.  The overall result
    is an album that warms the spirit and takes some of the bite out the chill
    outside for forty-five minutes.  And at this time of year, I could hardly ask
    for anything more.</p></div>"|4790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4790-lilac6/|7.5|Joe Tangari

    city life and moved into a very rural area about 30 miles from Austin, exposing
    me to a completely new side of American culture. After a few years of adjusting,
    I eventually embraced simple living and, naturally, the music of the simpler
    people. Then, one day, while driving into Austin, my mother was flipping channels
    on the radio when suddenly, amid the rants of early morning talk show hosts and
    adult contemporary, I heard the most glorious sound I have yet to hear.</p><p>
    
    ""Miles Davis?  Who the fuck is Miles Davis?  Mom, why doesn't Rick Dees play
    Miles Davis?""</p><p>
    
    When I got home I tried desperately to find that station again. Why had I never
    listened to it before? I spent literally an hour tuning the knobs of my stereo
    until it finally struck me that all those damn trees that provided us country
    folk with clean air were also mitigating my reception. From then on, I always
    attended my mother's trips into the city.  It allowed me to become familiar with
    all the college radio stations and the variety of music they played. Years went
    by. Owning a car facilitated my musical addictions and I discovered a place in
    my high school parking lot where I could pick up that one station perfectly.
    And thanks to that one song (""Blue in Green""), I became the man before you
    today.</p><p>
    
    I've already heard a dozen or so ill-conceived comparisons made for Yesterdays
    New Quintet: DJ Shadow, Amon Tobin, Coltrane, even Squarepusher. None of these
    are radically far from the group's essential style (except maybe Squarepusher)
    but when names are dropped in such a succession, it usually spells out a rote,
    by-the-numbers album. Congratulations, YNQ-- you delivered!</p><p>
    
    The record actually starts off fairly promising with decidedly downtempo beats
    supporting a Milt Jackson vibraphone line that gives way to a female MacInTalk
    voice reciting ""Yesterdays New Quintet"" continuously (as she does randomly
    throughout the record). The first of the DJ Shadow influences becomes apparent
    in the fractured beats of ""Julani"" (the group features a DJ in lieu of a live
    drummer) as drum fills are sampled, scratched, then strangely absent. ""Julani""
    climaxes rhythmically and segues into ""Papa,"" a funk jam already in progress.</p><p>
    
    It's ""Keeper of My Soul,"" however, that sets the formula for the album. The
    Quintet find a ""hook"" or a ""groove,"" pummel it into the ground using the same
    instrumental experiments as every other song (i.e. a wah-wah pedal and
    a Fender Rhodes), and then awkwardly fade out. That said, many of the tracks
    sound like excerpts from longer drone sessions. Hip-hop producer Madlib arranged
    this entire album, and many times, it appears that we're listening to unused or
    discarded backing tracks from his more successful endeavors as Quasimoto on last
    year's <i>The Unseen</i>.</p><p>
<i>Angles Without Edges</i> isn't guilty of being bad, just uninspired. Good jazz,
    like good electronic music, relies on many individually unique sounds to create
    something greater than the sum of its parts. Yesterdays New Quintet all too
    often sounds like a simple cut-n-paste job.</p></div>"|4176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4176-angles-without-edges/|6.8|Kevin Adickes

They're not
    intrigued to discover what aspect of their comfortable childhood will be warped
    in the lo-fi playroom phantasmagoria that Rosie Cuckston and her chums call
    existence. Perhaps the subdued tack that the band has taken on <i>Somniloquy</i>
    will soothe dissenters into compliance.</p><p>
    Ever since 1998's <i>North Pole Radio Station</i>, Pram have been rounding off
    the angles of their early albums, <i>Helium</i> and <i>Sargasso Sea</i>. The
    songs the band recorded were strangely alluring carnivorous plants with brightly
    colored barbs. Those barbs were defenses against the world's complaisance. But
    as the band's melodies became more hummable, their lyrics became ever more
    menacing. And their new nine-track EP, <i>Somniloquy</i>, begins with a superb
    example of this tactic.</p><p>
    Though it relies on a low-rent Mondo Exotico melody, ""Mother of Pearl"" is, in
    fact, a dime store rendering of one of Henry Fuseli's surrealist paintings.
    Cuckston sings with Björk-ish glee, ""Teaching snails to make pearls/ Coating with
    plastic an elastic world,"" which reminds me of the incidental nocturnal mutants
    that border Fuseli's gracefully ghoulish rendering of ""Oberon and Titania.""</p><p>
    ""The Way of the Mongoose"" is the first of three previously unreleased tracks,
    and harkens back to Pram's earlier tinkling on the borders of melody. Here, the
    band smacks away at various objects not previously recognized for their musical
    properties before a mariachi-like trumpet sets the party up with a solid Latin
    thumpathon. ""Monkey Puzzle"" begins as spy-flick bossanova while Cuckston
    incongruously sings about wanting to live in a ""tropicoloured world"" without
    ""black or white interpretations.""  The song won't add significantly to the
    world's appreciation of Pram, but neither does it disgrace the noble institution
    of the b-side.</p><p>
    Before the five remixes that most punters are going to leap on, Pram deliver the
    tender fairy lullaby, ""Clock Without Hands."" With the starkest of backing,
    Cuckston waltzes and lops from side to side as she sings about a man who's slept
    for all his life, and the endless web that binds us all together.  It begs the
    question: is Rosie a Jedi master or just a discrete bondage freak?</p><p>
    Like-minded infantalists Plone remix ""Bewitched"" from <i>The Museum of Imaginary
    Animals</i>. And though they don't enhance the song all that much, their treatment
    has provoked me into digging out my copy of their <i>For Beginner Piano</i> album,

    is slightly glitched and ridden low to the rocky road in the Balky Mule mix.
    Elsewhere, Terry:Funken's remix of <i>North Pole Radio Station</i>'s ""Omnichord""
    evolves from a brooding, burbling bossa nova to a clanking Heath Robinson machine

    their Red Army memorabilia for.</p><p>
    Overrated Twisted Nerve sneaker-freak Andy Votel continues in his underwhelming
    streak with his lackadaisical treatment of ""The Last Astronaut.""  Instead, Sir
    Real's reworking of ""A Million Bubbles Burst"" walks away with tonight's big cash
    prize.  Unlike the other remixers, Sir Real meets Pram on their own territory and
    takes them on his own ride. In this case, what begins as ""Pram visit the Klanger
    settlement of Oliver Postgate's vision of the Moon"" is hijacked by John Bonham's
    planet-pounding drums. The track is outstanding and, as the title of this EP
    suggests, it's the track that even hitherto Pram dissenters will be talking about
    in their sleep.</p></div>"|6443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6443-somniloquy-ep/|6.8|Paul Cooper

    breasts.  I stretched out on my car like a corpse on its bier, but revived at
    once under the steering wheel, a guillotine blade that threatened my stomach.
    The raging broom of madness swept us out of ourselves and drove us through
    streets as rough and deep as the beds of torrents... on we raced, hurling
    watchdogs under doorsteps, curling them under our burning tires like collars
    under a flatiron.  Death, domesticated, met me at every turn, gracefully holding
    out a paw, or once in a while hunkering down, making velvety caressing eyes at
    me from every puddle.""</p><p>
    
    And that's just the translation from Italian.  Almost overnight, F.T. Marinetti's
    <i>Manifesto of Futurism</i> birthed a new art movement that reflected the modern
    tensions of the 20th century.  His kinetic language stoked fires in the minds of
    young Italian men, disgruntled at the end of that first decade with an Italy
    lagging behind the rest of industrialized Europe.  They painted, they wrote,
    and they raced cars, their works mixing and clashing with Cubism, Dada,
    Surrealism, and all the avant-garde movements of the era.  They castigated
    museums, universities and other keepers of static culture, and their cult of
    masculinity and hedonism incited outraged riots, and nightmares in more than a
    few.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, Futurism was a radical movement, and it mostly attracted radicals.
    It died out as an official ideology within a decade, but its impulse lives on in
    various forms.  In music, the impulse can be heard in the works of musicians like
    Varese, Cage, Stockhausen, and in the public's scandalized reaction to jazz.
    Which gets me to thinking about today's popular indie bands, and how lazily we
    consider them to be cutting-edge-- why don't we demand as much as the Futurists
    did?</p><p>
    
    LU offer a partial answer to that question.  On their self-titled debut they've
    recorded some of the best techno-futuristic rock instrumentals I've heard in a
    long time.  They're direct descendants of the Krautrock sound, but please don't
    expect me to flourish the overused word ""motorik"" like I'm Joe Critic-- LU
    drummer Dan Searing does more than just chug monotonously.  His crisp chops are
    complemented perfectly by bassist Kristaps Kreslin's minimalist style.  And
    Matthew Dingee plays brilliantly, like he's compressed all the electronic quarks
    and pulsars from Tortoise's <i>Standards</i> into the strings of his guitar.
    It's one of the first releases for pulCec, a subsidiary of Darla Records founded
    by producer Trevor HollAnd.  But don't worry, robot-rockers: all the synthesized
    handclaps and gyroscopic grooves come through loud and clear.</p><p>
    
    ""Mood Elevator,"" the album's first track, propels forward with a bass drum and
    snare stamp-click-stamp-click as methodic as the driving bass.  Then Dingee's
    guitar worms its way into the mix, building a gentle anthemic vibe.  The label
    likens these guys to New Order, but only because the warmth of the melody is
    thrown into such stark contrast by the background's cold precision.  Gears shift
    quickly for the second song, and the comparisons to Neu! all begin to make sense.
    ""Biometric Authentication"" exists somewhere between retro and futurism, with the
    bass pulse impersonating the sensors, and the sparse guitar knifing out fractal
    geometry that would make Michael Rother jealous.</p><p>
    
    Other song titles convey similar functionality.  ""Aquarium Furniture"" drifts
    along on constant cymbals and a subaquatic bassline.  Dingee's reverb pierces
    the depths with seductive grace, each wavering chord casting reflections through
    the medicated haze.  ""Hot Knives"" pivots again on the rhythm section; the bass
    whirs and the drums multiply in skittering waves, evidence either of an
    electronic kit or Pro Tooling.  The guitar jeers and lures with all the entente
    of Rush (yes, Rush), and the weird samples smirk like one of Toenut's rabid jams.
    And who can resist a ride on the new wave keyboards and funky bassline of ""International
    Supercock?""</p><p>
    
    The two-word titles and the black-and-white of the bold LU font are just
    reflections of the band's binary structure.  Each song becomes a perpetual
    motion machine, the rhythm section shifting in synchronous harmony through
    multiple motifs and time signatures.  Of course, what they do isn't new-- you
    could replace every reference to ""LU"" in this review with ""Trans Am,"" and it
    would still be pretty accurate.  The Futurists probably wouldn't like LU after
    a few exposures-- they'd see how the band, like Trans Am, presents an image
    that's far more futuristic than the actual substance of their music.</p><p>
    
    But listen to how pretentious these guys were: ""Let us now, as Futurists, enter
    one of these hospitals for anaemic sounds.  There: the first bar brings the
    boredom of familiarity to your ear and anticipates the boredom of the bar to
    follow.  Let us relish, from bar to bar, two or three varieties of genuine
    boredom, waiting all the while for the extraordinary sensation that never comes.""
    Luigi Russolo wrote that in his manifesto, ""The Art of Noises,"" pertaining to how
    they wanted to make music from samples of everyday city sounds.  Yeah, elitism
    can be funny, but just as you can only listen to so many hours of Merzbow, you
    can only get off on liposuction sound-source albums for so long.  And to think:
    all they'd need to do is wander down to D.C.'s Pharmacy Bar, owned by LU bassist
    Kristaps Kreslin, and play a few tracks from this album on the jukebox.  They
    wouldn't have found the future they were seeking, but they'd have had their asses
    rocked, and maybe even gotten a free beer out of it.</p></div>"|4905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4905-lu/|8.0|Christopher Dare

    cold-shouldered by the newly formed Womyn's Collective for the following
    suggestion:</p><p>
    
    ""I think maybe riot grrls have it pretty easy, comparatively speaking.""</p><p>
    
    Silence.  I squirmed a bit in my seat, and felt stares of my classmates so hot
    with accusation that I swore I could feel the skin burning off my face.</p><p>
    
    The girl in charge (who would never admit to being in charge-- after all, this
    was a radical feminist organization and hierarchy is a patriarchal construct)
    cleared her throat ominously: ""Would you mind clarifying your comment, Alison?""</p><p>
    
    I swallowed, stymied.  How the hell do I get out of this one?  I mean, this is
    an all-women's college, and I've just cleared the path to take the sacred cow
    to the slaughtering block.  So I followed through.  ""Well, clearly I'm not going
    to make friends no matter what I say, so I might as well finish what I started.</p><p>
    
    ""It's like this: I think riot grrls are allowed, even encouraged, to play music
    of a significantly lesser quality than their male counterparts. I know it's punk
    rock to sound all raw and simplified, but it seems like riot grrls are allowed
    to be as bad as they want because they're largely cute and spunky and, well,
    girls. I mean, rock and roll has been a boy's club for years, and that should
    change, but our collective inability to put riot grrl bands under the same
    scrutiny we put any other band... I mean, isn't that kind of patronizing?""</p><p>
    
    The surrounding faces went near purple with rage. And yeah, I was only eighteen,
    but I knew how to take a hint. I left.</p><p>
    
    Approximately seven years to the day of my Womyn's Collective debacle, I find
    myself reviewing Le Tigre's second album, <i>Feminist Sweepstakes</i>, with some
    degree of trepidation. Seven years clears a lot of air. Of course, I'm less of
    a contrarian these days, and to be fair, some of those ex-riot grrls have made
    some really extraordinary music outside the confines of the movement they created.
    Kathleen Hanna among them.</p><p>
    
    Since the demise of Bikini Kill, Hanna has carved out some fairly innovative
    sounds, both with Le Tigre and alone as Julie Ruin.  Using samples, drum loops,
    fuzzy guitars and synthesizers, Le Tigre has created an infectious mode for
    delivery of heavy-handed polemic, as evidenced by their self-titled debut. It
    was-- to quote <i>Feminist Sweepstakes</i>' ""F.Y.R.""-- ""one cool record in the
    year of rock rap.""  And one of the best records I'd heard in a long time.</p><p>
<i>Feminist Sweepstakes</i> doesn't deviate much from the first album's sound,
    despite the change in line-up; shortly after the release of Le Tigre's 1999
    self-titled debut, JD Samson of the underground dance troupe Dykes Can Dance
    replaced video artist Sadie Benning.  The model is basically the same: hip-hop
    and disco-informed dance tunes undercut with punk rock adrenaline levels and
    post-feminist diatribes.  Only time out, it's more of a dance party.  The opener,
    ""LT Tour Theme,"" uses a spare 60s throwback dance sound and heavy metal guitar
    solo samples, over which Le Tigre sing, ""For the ladies and the fags, yeah/
    We're the band with the roller skate jams, yeah.""  And songs like ""Fake French""
    and ""Well Well Well"" marry hip-hop and new wave, coming off something like more
    sophisticated takes on Blondie's ""Rapture.""</p><p>
    
    Though it would be premature to accuse Le Tigre of mellowing with age-- especially
    with the shouted tirade on ""F.Y.R"" indicating the contrary-- there are moments
    when the ranting subsides.  ""TGIF"" closes with the refrain, ""We got friends in
    sight/ Tomorrow we fight/ Let's have fun tonight.""  Likewise, the album's closer,
    ""Keep On Livin',"" turns empowerment catchphrases into anthemic, garage punk fun.</p><p>
    
    And there, with the vengeful faces of the Womyn's Collective burned into my brain,
    is where I levy my single complaint. <i>Feminist Sweepstakes</i> wants to be a
    terrifically fun album, yet with no deviation from the ceaseless politics and
    endless drum machine beats, things go stale.  There are a growing number of
    female bands out there with the same basic premise as Le Tigre (most notably
    Chicks on Speed), making idiosyncratic dance pop for politically minded scenesters.
    Still, good as these things may seem, they rely too heavily on fad and can at
    times look a bit like novelty.</p></div>"|4705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4705-feminist-sweepstakes/|6.6|Alison Fields

    mysterious fascination. No longer reliant on shaky geocentric world views, and
    having scientifically proven that the moon is neither home to malicious space
    invaders nor made of tasty green cheese, I think we're ready to move on to
    something new. There's a whole universe of bizarre, mysterious things out there--
    black holes, dying stars, unexplored distant galaxies-- it seems kind of sad at
    this point that we still seem to be fascinated with a big rock that's only a few
    hundred thousand kilometers from earth.</p><p>
<i>Anthem of the Moon</i>, Oneida's fourth full-length album and second for
    Bloomington, Indiana's Jagjaguwar label, certainly carries with it some of the
    mystery that's often been attributed to the rocky satellite it's named after.
    With album art depicting odd rock formations, ancient instruments, naked guys on
    horses, and quasi-astrological imagery, and a sound that never seems completely
    settled or together, <i>Anthem of the Moon</i> isn't an album that gives itself
    away immediately. As one familiarizes oneself with the record, though, it becomes
    clear that there's some great, if sometimes uneven, music buried just beneath the
    record's surface.</p><p>
    
    Oneida puts their most hectic foot forward, opening the album with ""New Head,"" a
    synthesizer- and feedback-driven riff-rock number with a simple, if not
    particularly memorable chorus and some hints of melody buried in the song's
    midsection. That hint of melody is expanded upon with ""All Arounder,"" the best
    track here, and the one that best manages to reconcile Oneida's frenetic,
    unfocused sound with their ability to write memorable songs. Like its predecessor,
    ""All Arounder"" is sonically a mess, with guitars, synthesizers, bass and drums
    melding together into a swirly cloud of sound. The distinct, catchy vocals on
    the track provide a welcome contrast to its instrumental backing, a contrast that
    Oneida uses to their advantage throughout <i>Anthem of the Moon</i>.</p><p>
    
    Starting with ""Geometry,"" Oneida also begin to utilize some heavy contrast
    between consonance and dissonance. The synthesizers and vocals in ""Geometry""
    don't match up harmonically at first, and when the song later shifts into a
    dreamy major chord passage, the contrast is striking.  If the variety and
    contrast of this song were held up throughout <i>Anthem of the Moon</i>, the
    album would be nothing short of spectacular. Unfortunately, the quality of
    songwriting on the record is far from consistent. Songs like the 5+ minute-long
    ""Still Rememberin' Hidin' in the Stones"" and the infuriatingly repetitive ""Dead
    Worlds"" just serve as reminders that effects pedals and feedback can't make a
    boring song good. On ""Dead Worlds,"" in fact, the screeching guitar feedback that
    pops up every once in a while sounds completely out of place, bordering on
    annoying.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, the freaky sounds that permeate <i>Anthem of the Moon</i> really aren't
    what make it good at all. Sure, they add some flavor and perhaps an air of
    mystery, but cool sounds aside, Oneida can write some really, really great songs.
    For all its strangeness, <i>Anthem of the Moon</i> isn't all that different from
    the moon itself: it's really just rock.</p></div>"|5998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5998-anthem-of-the-moon/|7.8|Matt LeMay

    Cohen's charm, for me, lies mostly in his words and the way he says them.  This
    is perhaps something he picked up from the poets, or maybe imbedded from his
    years as a writer, before he ever recorded a note.  It's not that his music is
    easily dismissed, or even that his legacy isn't being closely guarded by dark,
    genius songwriters hidden somewhere in the corners between Bob Dylan, Nick Drake
    and probably anyone worth their ink everywhere.  Cohen's music is often the
    coolest part about what never immediately strikes me with his songs.  It's
    just always seemed a little secondary to his words.</p><p>
    
    It could be that you just don't write phrases like, ""May the lights in the
    Land of Plenty/ Shine on the truth someday,"" when making catchy tunes is your
    primary objective.  It seems to me Cohen's songs come more from a hope that
    he'll hit on an answer, or maybe if he's feeling generous, that he would be
    able translate some of the truth he already understands, more than from any
    kind of songwriting tradition.  I just read he was in a Buddhist monastery for
    the last few years.  His new words could be more prophetic than usual, or maybe
    just a little morbid, in the most humane way possible.  But they're his, and I
    suppose even the best people are obliged to listen.</p><p>
<i>Ten New Songs</i> is Cohen's first release of new material since 1992's <i>The
    Future</i>.  He often finds a partner to share the weight (usually on the musical
    end), and this time he's found Sharon Robinson.  Robinson (best known as a
    session vocalist, and pop songwriter), while certainly leaving her stamp on the
    proceedings as producer, arranger, performer, and co-writer on every tune, hasn't
    muffled Cohen's artistic voice any more than his previous collaborators.  Of
    course, her kind of soft rock-- closer to ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" by
    Foreigner than I'm comfortable with-- probably isn't going to score many points
    with the indie crowd, but it's not going to throw off your concentration for
    very long.</p><p>
    
    Tunes like ""In My Secret Life"" and ""Alexandra Leaving"" actually end up in a far
    more soulful world because of Robinson than if they had been purely Cohen efforts.
    These tunes, with Cohen's immensely weighty vocal, lower and possibly darker
    than ever before, shine with a peculiar optimism even as they betray his resolve
    with just about every corporeal sensation imaginable.  And his passion is still
    there: ""I'd die for the truth/ In my secret life,"" he sings in the opening track,
    and where there's a marked distaste for the material world all over the album,
    he still admits to buying ""what I'm told"" just like any other conditioned
    consumer species.  Maybe it's indecision, or maybe it's a realization of the
    hopelessness of running against the grain, but Cohen never stops to consider his
    own insights or stoop to self-pity.  Or, maybe I'm missing his point entirely.
    He's such a good writer that I wouldn't feel bad for having heard him speak/sing
    the stuff.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, though Robinson's slick backdrop relentlessly attempts to disguise
    it, Cohen unleashes harsher demons.  In ""By the Rivers Dark,"" he admits the
    constant threat to spirituality (in whatever form) in the modern world: ""And I
    did forget/ My holy song/ And I had no strength in Babylon.""  And, per his
    willingness to let it be, ""By the rivers dark/ Where it all goes on/ By the
    rivers dark in Babylon.""  There are perhaps correlations I could make to Cohen's
    recent immersion in Buddhism, and its doctrines of allowing one's self to flow
    with the river of life and to accept that we simply cannot know what we are not.
    But the truth is, Cohen has always been as perceptive, and has found his way
    seemingly by a mix of keen insight and passive discovery.</p><p>
    
    There are moments where I wonder if he hasn't gone over the edge into
    helplessness, letting his inner conflicts have their way with him.  ""Boogie
    Street"" (I know, terrible title, and let me say that Robinson's uber-lame
    Skin-emax sex scene atmospherics don't exactly do the tune any favors) opens
    with a joyful reunion with the ""Darkened One.""  ""A sip of wine, a cigarette,""
    and Cohen's ready to take a trip to other side, meeting any number of transient
    pleasures on an avenue where ""all the maps of blood and flesh are posted on
    the door.""  And the song never brings you back to the safe neighborhoods.  Maybe
    this isn't the kind of thing that goes over well as a conversation piece, and if
    I had one request, it would be to listen to the album after a shot of something
    very hard (but very smooth), and just take it in alone.</p><p>
    
    The album ends with ""The Land of Plenty,"" and suitably, Cohen picks the last
    song to raise the layered curtain a little.  The tenth new song features
    reminders of forgotten promises (""I know I said I'd meet you... I can't buy it
    anymore"") and faiths long since given up (""For the Christ who has not risen""),
    but then it lets me down gently.  He says, ""May the lights in the land of plenty
    shine on the truth some day.""  And this is where I remember why I listen to him:
    Cohen says these words as if he heard them on top of a mountain.  Maybe he heard
    them from some Zen master who doesn't have to live in our world, and must have
    realized their meaning while meditating, transcended from pain, but soaked in
    wisdom.  But this is not where the words came from; Cohen said them, and he
    wrote them, and whether it's nice music or just amazing prose, I can only tell
    you what I heard.</p></div>"|1527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1527-ten-new-songs/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    label headz) Phoenecia, the last two appearing in '99. A dark electro track
    bearing that title appeared on their debut, <i>Brownout</i>, but the two
    previous <i>Odd Job</i> EPs predated that album, and I can hear only traces of
    the track on these six reworkings.  Phoenecia may be fucking with my head with
    this cryptic discographical smokescreen, but I can deal: this EP is sweet.</p><p>
    
    The kickoff flies through the uprights courtesy of Matmos, who dance the Garo
    Yepremian all over the characteristically dense and funky ""The Climatic Battle
    Scene Between Rom &amp; Josh Version."" The tune starts in Buck Rogers mode, tossing
    lasers, snarling drums and voices together like the Egyptian Lover upgraded to
    32 bits. A third of the way in, live drums overwhelm the song and then trail off
    into polyrhythmic drum programming and a deep thicket of textured effects.</p><p>
    
    Someone or something called Adult comes next, with a nostalgic electro trip fit
    for Rephlex called ""Compurythm Version"" that incorporates the new wave ""Me and
    My Rhythm Box"" from 80s cult film <i>Liquid Sky</i>. The primitive keyboards and
    drum pads benefit from a 21st century sensibility, and the track is nothing short
    of killer. Dino Felipe slows things down for the abstractly pretty ""Sun Deck
    Version,"" which has the flavor of the studied silliness that used to flow like
    Riesling from the A-Musik compound.</p><p>
    
    Prefuse 73's ""Ramen Noodle Version"" is very much of a piece with <i>Vocal Studies
    + Uprock Narratives</i>, with steady rolling beats, warm organ chords, and tiny
    fragments of rap tossed in the air like confetti. Otto Von Schirach gets a bit
    showy with his DSP tricks on ""Tre Deuce Ave. Smash &amp; Grab Version,"" but he redeems
    himself with a hypnotic 808 bass hook and a complex beat that remains danceable.
    Closing out this 30-minute set, Jeswa's ""Dreamlike Steak Version"" improves on the
    gauzy electronoir ambience of Autechre's ""Amber."" (I was never crazy about that
    <i>Ae</i> record, though I know it is loved by many.)</p><p>
    
    Whatever the actual sound files used to create <i>Odd Job Discrimination</i>,
    to my mind this is the perfect remix record-- short, punchy and great to listen
    to in one sitting. Though they remain in the armchair camp, Phoenecia's style of
    IDM gives much respect to the floor-filling rhythm. Most of the tracks on <i>Odd

I mean, how many times
    have you seen Orb albums in the used bins?  <i>Orbus Terrarum</i> is one of the
    best albums I've ever heard-- an entire ecosystem pressed into the polycarbonate
    spirals of a compact disc-- and that doesn't save it from being discarded like
    so much trash.  It's a busy world, and I guess few have the time for a listening
    experience that involves patience and effort, but they're missing out on one of
    music's most rewarding pleasures: sublime absorption in a world of sound.</p><p>
    
    As head of the Western Automatic project, Matt Christensen employs techniques
    similar to the digital minutiae of the Orb.  <i>It's 1995</i>, his debut, builds
    its soundworld on the lazy continental driftings of bass dub and populates it
    with the filtered fuzzscapes of Pan Sonic.  The album's title is deceiving; it
    was, of course, recorded in 2000.  What seem to be wedding pictures fill the
    sleeves, and the blank swaths of green where faces should be (clearly, an homage
    to Boards of Canada) leave little clue to the strange title.  The minimalist
    packaging may have contributed to this album slipping notice last year, and it's
    a shame: this third release on the Loose Thread label is immensely rich and
    seductive.</p><p>
    
    A refrigerator-like hum starts ""A Lady Captain"" with a subdued vibe.  Fuzzy
    static germinates, rolling in soft waves as beats start to sprout at the crests.
    I'm amazed by the sense of narrative development here-- little beeps and drones
    guiding the listener along the path whenever the course starts to get repetitive.
    ""The Gods Hate Kansas"" continues the psychedelic evolution, with echoing keyboard
    accents spaced out across the terrain.  This disc makes different listening
    environments necessary; you can only truly feel the slow, seismic bass shifts on
    stereo speakers.</p><p>
    
    Likewise, the brushing cilia at the beginning of ""Painted Doctor"" are best heard
    with headphones.  But beats fade in soon and invigorate all the ambience, keeping
    it from becoming sterile airport music.  Things gets funky later on with
    ""Soultrain Alaska,"" as a five-note descending bassline brings pulsing dub
    revolutions.  The pleasing grooves and squirmy keyboards could only be referred
    to as Lee <i>Scratch Pet Land</i> Perry.  Christensen's also not afraid to get
    abstract.  The glacial hulk of ""Queen of Princeton"" fractures from the slo-mo
    syncopation of its percussion, as a sea of synthlines undulate underneath.</p><p>
    
    It's difficult, as you're listening to the cybernetic snores of ""Friends of Mine,""
    to believe that parts of these songs were recorded live.  But Christensen's
    technique for <i>It's 1995</i> was to prerecord a number of drone landscapes and
    then play his keyboard improvisations over the mix.  You can detect his impressive
    human touch on tracks like ""Make a Movie,"" though, as the inverse-whirlpool-flow
    spits up sharp synth jabs and quirky chord progressions.  A listen to the entire
    album reveals these lovely moments, similar to the overlapping organics of Four
    Tet's instrumentals.  So it's doubly frustrating when the end of each track cuts
    off abruptly and the editing becomes obvious.</p><p>
    
    On other songs, however, the processes set in motion seem beyond human control.
    The last, ""The Hard Way We Go,"" reverberates like the steady march of an army of
    ants to the surface.  Maybe all of these autonomous rhythms provide a hint as to
    why Christensen chose to record under the name Western Automatic.  It's harder
    to see why so many critics panned <i>It's 1995</i> as aural wallpaper, but it's
    clear the title refers to a time when electronica first started receiving
    widespread recognition, and it's not difficult to involve yourself in the steady
    sound of this album's floral awakening.</p></div>"|8635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8635-its-1995/|8.0|Christopher Dare

    wondering who or what this Kammerflimmer Kollektief is. After all, while Thomas
    Weber (the man behind the name) isn't exactly flooding the shelves with releases
    as quickly as say Acid Mothers Temple, he's still had three releases hit the bins
    stateside in little under a year. Two of those releases (both <i>Mäander</i> and
    this newest on Temporary Residence) were domestic issues of once import-only
    discs, while the recent <i>Hysteria</i> was a new recording for Japan's After
    Hours label. With three titles (and likely another on the way, noting Weber's
    prolific nature) in such a short time, many people out there might be scratching
    their heads wondering which, if any, of these titles to pick up. So, where does
    <i>Incommunicado</i> stack up next to the other two? Well, it's somewhere in the
    middle.</p><p>
    In contrast to Payola label mates Tied and Tickled Trio (whose contributors
    usually number anywhere from 5 to 12 members), this ""kollektief"" started out as
    just one guy doing everything. But sometime after those first singles, Weber
    must've figured the band should live up to its name, so he recruited five other
    skilled musicians who've since stuck around. While Weber busied himself with
    electronic manipulations and studio tricks on <i>Hysteria</i>, there's no sign
    of it here as he plays only guitar. In fact, excepting Anne Vortisch's
    synthesizer, this is the most organic recording for the group to date.</p><p>
    Those familiar with <i>Mäander</i> might spot a few recognizable track names on
    this release. The title <i>Incommunicado</i> means ""improvisations"" and that
    seemed to be the impetus for this experiment. Apparently, Weber handed out
    copies of that earlier release to members of his sextet and asked them to study
    the song structures, tone and composition for a future recording. The result is
    what we have here. A clever ploy by Weber to recycle previously used material?
    Not so much. The three carry-over tracks (""Nachtwach,"" ""Gras"" and ""Rand"") are
    faintly identifiable incarnations of earlier versions. They've been altered in
    every shape imaginable, sometimes stretching out onto a lengthier jazz terrain
    and sometimes veering out of control, reduced to disruptive sax squawks, shrieks
    and machine-gun percussion.</p><p>
    These loose improvisations do a stellar job retaining Kammerflimmer's distinctive
    sound of rhythmic tensions building into explosive bursts of noise. ""Nachtwach""
    slinks into the picture first and it becomes obvious immediately that this isn't
    going to be Weber's show. Reduced to mainly a background fixture on guitar, this
    album belongs to bassist Johannes Frisch and saxophonist Dietrich Foth. Frisch
    wastes no time launching the band out of the gate and digs his heels in as the
    band pieces together a new version of Weber's composition. That characteristic
    blast of noise still makes its presence known, though. Playing around the
    original theme at the start, the sextet eventually careens after a few minutes
    into Foth's high register squeals and Michael Ströder's punctuated bouts with
    the drum kit.</p><p>
    The identifiable ""Gras"" follows and the group immediately references the original
    track before slowly assembling a wholly new sound entity. Building at a much
    slower pace than anything else on the disc, the group allows space and silence
    to have as vital a role in this piece as their playing. Extending far past the
    12-minute mark, this is just about as quiet and evocative a song as anything
    they've ever done. Violinist Heike Wendelin and Foth begin to fill the space
    with sporadic noises, quivering drones out of the violin and tiny squeaks from
    the sax. About 10 minutes in, things start to get a little haywire as Frisch
    begins to bang his bow against the bass strings. Ströder at times pretends he's
    keeping time with a marching band, while Foth sends forth a handful of shuddering
    shrieks from the sax. Stretching out into epic territory, ""Gras"" is the finest
    moment here. It's reliant as much on sparseness and Kammerflimmer's members
    listening to each other as it is the group playing together. With seemingly no
    pressure to sustain the ordinary rhythmic tension, the individual members are
    able to explore different sound regions and bounce new ideas off each other.</p><p>
    Along with the other two <i>Mäander</i> tracks, there's ""Rand,""a truncated sound
    detonation that ends as quickly as it begins. Lasting only 50 seconds, it's a
    feverish, ecstatic blast with every member playing as loud and abrasive as the
    next. Coming off like a live, improvised version of Weber's signature burst of
    static hiss and tape noise, the worst part about the song is its abruptness; it
    ends so quickly it leaves the listener salivating for more. Instead of lurching
    into something expected like a dissonance-filled wall of sax wail and shrill
    violin, the band quickly drifts into a Robert Wyatt cover: ""Venti Latir"" from
    his early 90s EP <i>A Short Break</i>. It's a beautiful violin-driven update of
    the original, lilting gently back and forth on Wendelin's strings. It's a rarity
    for Weber's group, placing more emphasis on the swaying melody than rhythm or
    shaping the tension.</p><p>
    The final two tracks are new songs, ""Kissen"" and ""Holler."" The first of the two
    is a directionless drone centered on the synthesizer, violin and bass. Problem
    is, the band doesn't really allow itself enough space or time to pull the track
    into anything more than a gliding mess and the whole thing ends up sounding out
    of place. ""Holler,"" on the other hand, is a sheer delight. It's less than a
    minute of Frisch vehemently scraping his bow across the bass strings, the result
    being something analogous to that of John Cale or Tony Conrad's abrasive string
    treatments in Dream Syndicate.</p><p>
    With only six tracks (three of those being revisions of earlier songs),
    <i>Incommunicado</i> might seem to fall short. However, this is an album that
    requires time to unfold. I'm in the unique position of having been one of the
    people who bought the earlier import version of this, which was released almost
    simultaneously with <i>Mäander</i> overseas. Having had time to digest this album
    more than I normally would with a review, I can say that, at first, it seems like
    a disjointed affair with tracks like ""Gras"" wandering purposelessly around and
    the bursting ""Rand"" and ""Holler,"" which both stand in contrast to that meandering
    exploration. But given repeated listening and time to unfurl, the pieces here
    stand alongside the best stuff in Weber's bag of tricks, proving that he's as
    adept in the group improvisation setting as he was flying solo in the studio.</p></div>"|4380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4380-incommunicado/|7.1|Luke Buckman

    as ""painfully ordinary kids from a middle class background,"" hand over two new
    tracks to Germany's Thomas Morr, proprietor of underground electronic phenom
    Morr Music. The two original tracks, as well one brief reprise, do not stray far
    from Múm's pastoral electronics as instated on this year's stunning <i>Yesterday
    Was Dramatic - Today is OK</i>. Morr passes the tracks off to some of his finest
    tweakers: Styrofoam, Isan, Phonem, Christian Kleine, Arovane, and B. Fleischmann.
    Result: forty-five more minutes of electronic bliss.</p><p>
<i>Please Smile My Noise Bleed</i> works much like a film soundtrack, with its
    first two cuts, ""On the Old Mountain Radio"" and ""Please Sing My Spring Reverb,""
    setting the themes that will be reiterated throughout.  (The rest of the album
    consists of remixes of these two.)  While the basic elements present on these
    new tracks-- diced voices, schizophrenic clicks, light music-box-like synths--
    aren't particularly neoteric, their melodies, rather than the sounds themselves,
    are repeatedly reconstructed as the album's centerpiece.  This isn't to say that
    the timbre of the instruments on these opening two tracks should be disregarded,
    but the purity of the near-sine-wave tones promotes the clarity of their
    melodies.</p><p>
    While the remixers tend to lose this mentality, they generally preserve the
    idyllic atmosphere proposed by the originals. Isan's ""Catena Mix"" of ""Please
    Sing My Spring Reverb"" distorts and echoes the melody while adding an overdrive
    to the drum track.  Christian Kleine's ""Sole Mix"" of ""On the Old Mountain Radio""
    replaces the simple schizophrenic clicks with an elementary drum machine track
    that longs to sound acoustic, but ultimately, with its airy hi-hat and wisps,
    falls nearer to Aphex Twin.  In fact, the tendency for many of these remixes is
    to replace the focus of the melody with percussive elements.  As a result, a
    sense of movement that's absent in the originals-- which appear more or less
    sedentarily contemplative-- is instilled.  But even with Múm's melodic base
    taking the passenger seat, the movement created is anything but turbulent.</p><p>
    What's most intriguing is how well this record actually works as a whole. This
    can partially be attributed to the 1\xBD-minute interlude, ""Flow Not So Fast My Old
    Mountain Radio,"" which reaches for something completely different with
    accelerated and interlocked synth arpeggios. The melodic lines resemble
    harps, but the synth remains in no-attack, sine-wave airspace.</p><p>
    This track aside, the theme and variation scheme does hinder some elements, but
    it never approaches tedium. In fact, five of the six remixes are of ""Please Sing
    My Spring Reverb,"" and the vitality of the theme never wanes. The work of the
    remixers is also balanced in the opposite sense so that there's a sense of
    coherency that defies the tracks sounding disparate. One gets the feeling that
    the remixers respected the intentions of the originals enough to retain them in
    their own versions.</p><p>
    The album closes with Bernard Fleischmann's outstanding mix of ""Spring Reverb,""
    which approaches organic sound in a way most of these other tracks don't.  It
    begins with voices extracted from near the end of the original, but by being left
    untreated, they become stark in contrast to the static Fleischmann throws in
    every few measures.  Much of the original's tinkling bell melodies are removed,
    and the drums are brought up to support the voice.  Eventually, the mix collapses
    into an amalgam of looped voices, creating an eerie yet moving effect before it
    glitches jerkily into a complete stop.</p><p>
<i>Noise Bleed</i> begins and ends with manipulated human voices, reflecting that
    Múm demonstrate the ability to alter the spectrum of fabricated electronic sound
    in a natural way that resembles direct expression.  These remixes, while rarely
    true to the originals in a natural sense, manage to maintain this humanity for
    the most part, and in some cases, magnify it.  It's a testament not only to the
    talent of Morr Music's roster, but also to the rapid evolution of electronics.</p></div>"|5503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5503-please-smile-my-noise-bleed/|8.7|Christopher F. Schiel

    have been showing up everywhere. In fashion, all the youth energy is carried on
    in Paris with Nicolas Ghesquiere, Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs, and Stella McCartney,
    among others, all calling the city their own.  French cinema is also getting
    over its dry spell with a new Charlotte Gainsbourg film in the works, as well as
    American actresses like Chloë Sevigny working there now. French music has found a
    fanbase in America, with Daft Punk and Air becoming nigh-household names.  In
    past years most popular things in Paris were imported from America or other
    countries.  But this new excitement is purely French, a celebration of their
    country.  It's almost patriotic.</p><p>
    So, with all of this going on, what does one of France's living legends spend
    her time doing? Well, if you're Brigitte Fontaine, you call up long-time partner
    Areski, as well as Jim O'Rourke, Sonic Youth, Noir Desir, and Dave Pajo to help
    make the most colorful record of your career (complete with Eiffel towers amid
    the cover art and minimal English). Brigitte's music has always been varied and
    eclectic, ranging from the semi-traditional (albeit quirky) French-pop
    orchestrations of her 1970 debut, <i>Brigitte Fontaine Est...</i>, through her
    work with the Art Ensemble of Chicago; from her early a capella work with Areski
    to their later psychedelic Moog experiments in the late 70s. 1997's <i>Les
    Palaces</i> showed a more electronic sound, similar to Stereolab's <i>Dots and
    Loops</i> of that time. But as vast as her sounds were, each album remained
    similar in tone.  That's what makes <i>Kekeland</i> so exciting-- each song is
    an entirely different style. Such a vast mix of sounds can get confusing, but
    the record never sounds strained or forced, and manages to achieve a nice flow
    throughout.</p><p>
    ""Demie Clocharde"" opens the album with a low-key SYR-sound, but is soon broken
    up by a decidedly simple and clean piano line.  After a while, the piano morphs
    into a keyboard and then back.  The next track, ""Bis Baby Boum Boum"" could pass
    as Limp Bizkit, with Areski passing as a vastly superior Fred Durst and Brigitte
    pulling out her best Patty Waters scream. ""Pipeau"" has a great Blondie/Clash
    reggae vibe to it and ""Je T'aime Encore"" sounds like a long-lost Kurt Weill song
    that Marianne Faithfull couldn't handle. ""God's Nightmare"" sounds like a perfect
    single, complete with dance-pop hooks galore, and ""Guadalquivir"" tries on Spanish
    flamenco.</p><p>
    ""Les Filles D'Aujuord'hui"" has the traditional, pretty Jane Birkin-ish keyboard
    lines which reflect the source of French music that's been expanded upon with
    this release. It brings you back to the Paris of baguettes and red lipstick, of
    berets and cigarettes.  <i>Kekeland</i> is the perfect accompaniment to this
    worldwide rediscovery of Paris as a source of art. Like all good memories and
    tributes, it salutes the past while looking to the future. And who better to take
    us there than Brigitte Fontaine? As she makes known in the title track, ""You
    know I am the queen, the queen of Kekeland."" Yes, Mme. Fontaine, Nico and Yoko
    Ono still have nothing on you.</p></div>"|3143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3143-kekeland/|8.0|Andi Rowlands

According to my friend Joel Bogorad, even     Bogorad is inevitable.  Nothing Bogorad says or does is a matter of his choice,     and nothing he will do can be altered or prevented. Bogorad's final chapter is     already written, even though he has yet to find out the ending. Believe Bogorad,     and you share the same fate. After all, Bogorad is a determinist-- he believes     that every choice he makes is determined by prior experiences, dating back to     before his birth.  Because he can do nothing to change those experiences, he has     absolutely no choice in his future. It will happen, and he won't have a thing to     do with it. How Bogorad sleeps, I don't know.</p>
<p>Silver Mt. Zion are likewise pledged to the inevitable. According to members of     the Canadian collective, the demise of humanity is as inevitable as Bogorad     himself. Globalization, the prison industrial complex and ""<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">terminal</span> economies of blood,"" are processes and entities on an irreversible course toward     ruin.  Efrim, Sophie, Thierry, Beckie, Ian and Jessica have no illusions of     changing fate; they simply aim for virtue.</p>
<p>The music of Silver Mt. Zion embodies that worldview. They're clearly not     competing for listeners. If they are, they're doing everything wrong-- no catchy     melodies, no hooks, no guitar solos, no cleavage. And I dare you to mass produce     their packaging (all cardboard, a full page of anti-capitalist calligraphy, and,     oh yeah, a picture of an old guy trying to revive a dead person. Nice).  No, the     goal is not popular stardom, or even acceptance. Rather, it's musical integrity;     to create gorgeous music without regard for convention. Furthermore, as fans of     Silver Mt. Zion (and their foster-parents, Godspeed You Black Emperor!) have     come to appreciate, their sullen, brooding arrangements could do as much to     communicate the ruin of humanity as ten Efrim interviews.</p>
<p><i>Born into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward</i> is a regally ambitious album,     even by this band's standards. Even so, you wouldn't know it from the first two     tracks.  The opening composition, ""Sisters! Brothers! Small Boats are Falling     from the Sky!"" is updated chamber music, opening with a percussive echo that     gives way to a simple, four-note string arrangement. Both yield as a mournful     piano melody enters, complemented by chamber strings and the faint buzz-wail of     manipulated tape. The song builds strength, but never reaches crescendo, leaving     the listener to cope with unresolved sadness.  ""This Gentle Hearts Like Shot     Bird's Fallen"" employs similar dynamics, moving from the concocted chirps and     echoes to a disquieted string theme.</p>
<p>The problem in striving for high art is that sometimes pretentiousness, like     Bogorad, is also inevitable.  The members of Silver Mt. Zion have always flirted     with pretentiousness, but in most cases, they've remained clearly on the side of     profundity.  Unfortunately, the flirting on prior albums and projects has     developed into a full-borne crush.  For example, the monologue on ""Built Then     Burnt (Hurrah! Hurrah!)"" is unbearably amateurish, delivered by either a bad     child actor, or a bad adult actor doing a child's voice. As bad as the monologue     is, the swarm of whiny, multi-tracked voices on the tense, grating ""Take These     Hands and Throw Them in the River"" is worse. ""Worse,"" as in, it reminded me of     the Scorpions (yes, those Scorpions).  The vocals on this track-- performed by     the band's Constellation Records labelmate Frankie Sparo-- aren't far removed     from the gritty operatics of front-Scorpion Klaus Meine, and they're delivered     with all the false melodrama of Queensryche.</p>
<p>After this, however, Silver Mt. Zion returns to form, following the compellingly     distraught ""Could've Moved Mountains"" with the soundtrack-ish (albeit slightly     boring) ""Tho You Are Gone I Still Often Walk w/You."" The most dynamic selection     on <i>Born into Trouble</i>, and its only real rock number, is ""C'mon Come On     (Loose an Endless Longing),"" which-- after building into noise-- fades into     formless ambience, then returns to rock with a completely indulgent and entirely     satisfying overblown full-band catharsis.  The closing number stands out, as well,     because it's actually a ""song,"" and because it isn't nearly as depressing as the     rest of the album.  But they do sing about guns, cancer, barricades, ""losing your     way,"" and shit like that, so what do I know?  It sounds kind of pretty.</p>
<p>I'll stand by this band-- they're still too good to be true. But, like the rest     of us ignorant, inevitable human beings, Silver Mt. Zion occasionally slips.     Here, the slips are noticeable, and the formula wears a little thin, but for the     most part, <i>Born into Trouble</i> remains an intense and engaging album.</p></div>"|7166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7166-born-into-trouble-as-the-sparks-fly-upward/|7.7|Brad Haywood

    The debut record by Triangle US, the moronically titled <i>*</i>, is pretty
    dismissable stuff. Acoustic and hyper-clean electric guitars jangle under
    squirting synths, as some art school grads chirp pretentious lyrics of no
    consequence.  There's nothing egregiously wrong with the music itself-- it's
    just your average, typically mediocre Pro Tools pop with beats as crisp and thin
    as the crackers at a low-budget wine and cheese party.  What really sinks <i>*</i>,
    though, is the singing.</p><p>
    The second Amanda Warner opens her reedy little throat on the first track, ""The
    Results,"" the show's over.  Her voice is flat, with a halfhearted hitch and no
    emotional delivery.  But wait!  She's soon joined by the other 1\xBD sides of the
    Triangle, Brian Tester. His voice is mildly nasal, mildly ironic, and in general,
    mild. Though similar in their flatness, neither singer's voice blends with the
    other. The vocals intertwine and trade off with zero chemistry, almost as if
    completely oblivious to the fact that there's another person singing.</p><p>
    ""8:26 a.m.,"" probably the ""best"" of these tracks, explores a bit of an Afro-pop
    sound, with some bongos and shiny, clean guitar lines.  If only it didn't sound
    like Peter Gabriel.  When your third-world cultural exploration ends up sounding
    like an old British guy, you're on to nothing. There's a springy ""booooiiiing""
    sound, too.  (Never a good sign.)</p><p>
    The album continues along, usually fading into white noise rather than actively
    irritating. If you're like me, you'll have to keep listening to it so you can
    vaguely describe what it sounds like.  But chances are, you'll never have to
    listen to it, ever.  Keep your fingers crossed.</p><p>
    But enough about <i>*</i>. Let's get back to that battle between Mr. Fantastic
    and Plasticman:</p><p>
    ""Look out, Mr. Fantastic! He's stretching!""</p><p>
    ""You can stretch all you want, Plasticman. You're no match for my stretching
    powers!""</p><p>
    ""Oh, yeah, Mr. Fantastic?  Well, stretch your way out of this!""</p><p>
    ""Pretty stretchy, Plasticman, but watch out for my super-stretch!""</p><p>
    ""Oh yeah?  Stretch this!""</p><p>
    ""I'll stretch you, ya stretchy son-of-a-bitch!""</p><p>
    Next: It's stretch time!</p></div>"|8150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8150-triangle/|2.7|Dan Kilian

    mentioned in the same breath as weirdos Harry Partch, Captain Beefheart and
    William S. Burroughs? And the answer is: I don't know. Ask Tom Waits. He'd
    probably tip his hat back, mumble some lengthy convoluted story about how he was
    born in the back of a cab, and go straight into how he was hired for his first
    paying gig based solely on the shoes he was wearing. After which, he'll most
    likely break into a wide, toothy grin, scoop up some confetti from his coat
    pocket and sprinkle it over his head before he vanishes in a cloud of sawdust
    and smoke.</p><p>
    
    Back before his days as demented carnival barker and the macabre stories of
    butchers, German dwarves and the Eyeball Kid, Tom Waits was plying his craft as
    a gravel voiced faux-beat singer plink-plonking his way around a piano and
    writing songs about hookers, hobos and gangsters. Come to think of it, Waits has
    been dancing around the same ideas, updating variations on the same characters
    in his own twisted, offbeat mythologies since the mid-70s. It's just that when
    1983 and <i>Swordfishtrombones</i> rolled around the songs transformed into
    something much more carnival-esque, while the music drifted into the sphere of
    Partch-like percussion and disjointed guitar riffs.</p><p>
    
    Up to that point, he'd (for
    the most part) been working with mainly conventional melodies and dipping his
    fingers into folk, rock and jazz. During that early time, he had a musical
    persona that was street-smart swagger mixed with affection for all the losers
    and down-and-outs. Throughout three decades of writing songs, he's always been
    in touch with society's seedy underbelly, reserving a place in his songs for the
    downtrodden and the beat. Whether you belong to an underground civilization of
    dwarves or you're a down-on-his-luck bum sitting in a puddle of rain, you've got
    a place in Waits' world.</p><p>
    
    What with the drastic musical makeover and label jump in the 80s, a distinctive
    line was drawn between the later work and the 70s stuff. Ask pretty much any
    longtime Waits fan what their favorite album is and they might just give you
    two: one from his early drunken-lounge-singer years and one from his
    post-1983-metamorphosis into ghoulish Vaudevillian ringleader. All this shifting
    and change makes it frustratingly impossible to put together a career-spanning
    single disc retrospective, so what Rhino and Mr. Waits have put together instead
    is a hodgepodge of tracks from the Elektra/Asylum years.</p><p>
    
    Enough with the introduction, then. Let's get to the meat of the matter. What's
    the track selection like? Are there rarities? Outtakes and demos? Live
    obscurities? Well, as the title suggests, <i>Used Songs</i> is an assortment of
    16 tracks spanning from Waits' first album, <i>Closing Time</i>, to 1980's
    <i>Heartattack and Vine</i>. Everything that's to be had here is available on
    the official releases from the period and much of it's been collected previously
    on two separate anthologies. So everyone out there holding their breath for
    unreleased tracks and live-only gems like ""Hokey Pokey"" and ""Trash Day"" can keep
    their fingers crossed for next time.</p><p>
    
    What's obvious on first glance at the song selection is the lack of very early
    material. Only three tracks from the first three albums appear, while the later
    albums often get three or four tracks apiece. ""Ol' 55,"" made famous by the Eagles,
    is the only track on here from <i>Closing Time</i> and it's drastically different
    than anything else, even though it might be the most recognizable to the Waits
    novice. It captures Waits in his early years, his voice still smooth, and the
    comparisons to James Taylor and the singer/songwriters of the period still apt.</p><p>
    
    By the time he'd recorded the rambling small-town beauty of ""(Looking
    for) The Heart of Saturday Night"" Waits' voice was already exhibiting signs of
    the gravel voice that would become so signature to his later sound. The only
    live track available here is from <i>Nighthawks at the Diner</i>, the in-studio
    recording documenting Waits' inclination to rambling offbeat stories, which
    eventually segue into tracks like ""Eggs and Sausage (In a Cadillac with Susan
    Michelson).""</p><p>
    
    And then, somewhere around 1976, Waits found a new distinctive voice that blended
    the sprawling myths of American culture and city life with the poetry and swagger
    of beats like Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady. If you add to the mix his ability
    to turn a line, an offbeat sense of humor and an increasing musical vocabulary,
    the result was something completely enchanting. Tracks like the Elvis-inspired
    strut of ""Burma Shave"" or the heartbreaking pair ""Christmas Card from a Hooker
    in Minneapolis"" and ""Blue Valentines"" are windows into American life akin to the
    heartbreak, desolation and simple warmth of an Edward Hopper painting. In the
    jazz-poetry goof on the sleazy-salesman's ""Step Right Up,"" Waits spits out a
    sequence of hilarious one-liners: ""It gives you an erection/ It wins the election""
    or ""Change your shorts/ Change your life/ Change your life/ Change into a
    nine-year old Hindu boy/ Get rid of your wife.""</p><p>
    
    An odd inclusion here is the duet with Bette Midler, ""I Never Talk to Strangers,""
    from 1977's <i>Foreign Affairs</i>. The track itself is a pretty standard jazz
    duet, with banter between the two singers exchanged throughout. Even though
    they're not included here, Waits went on to offer much more successful duets on
    record, with Crystal Gayle (an even odder choice?) on the soundtrack to <i>One
    from the Heart</i>. By the time Waits recorded his last album for Asylum in 1980
    (<i>Heartattack and Vine</i>), rock was his primary musical influence and he'd
    almost abandoned the neo-beat persona completely.  Bruce Springsteen would later
    take the sha-la-la's and tenderness of ""Jersey Girl"" and turn them into a hit.
    Notice the trend in artists turning Waits-penned tunes into hits.</p><p>
    
    ""Tom Traubert's Blues (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen)"" closes the disc.
    Taken from 1976's <i>Small Change</i>, it's the perfect closer to the album and,
    in my opinion, the best track available here. A downtrodden tale full of woe and
    misfortune, it's one of those tracks that puts you right on the barstool, fifth
    beer in front of you-- a portrait of loneliness and bleakness.  It's a harrowing
    romance from probably the greatest album of Waits' early years, which brings me
    to my problem with the collection.</p><p>
<i>Small Change</i> is sadly under-represented here, with only the amazing ""Step
    Right Up"" and ""Tom Traubert's Blues"" on the roll call. So, my only complaint
    about this record is the questionable absence of the gorgeous ""Invitation to the
    Blues."" Other than that and some near-clunkers (""I Never Talk to Strangers""),
    <i>Used Songs</i> is an exceptional gathering of Waits' material.</p><p>
    
    But I guess the question remains: is the compilation worth the investment? Well,
    for Waits beginners, this and the recently compiled <i>Beautiful Maladies</i> are
    perfect launching points into both eras of his career. Sadly, these are only
    temporary fixes. It'll just make most people clamber for albums like <i>Small
    Change</i> and <i>Blue Valentines</i> or <i>Rain Dogs</i> and <i>Bone Machine</i>.
    But, for me and fellow collector scum, sets like this serve as additions to a
    completists' collection. Finally, though, these two anthologies make it painfully
    obvious that if anyone at all deserves the box set treatment (outtakes, demos,
    live cuts and unreleased nuggets like ""Alice""), Mr. Waits is easily the number
    one contender.</p></div>"|8561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8561-used-songs-1973-1980/|8.8|Luke Buckman

    have foreseen it?  Bands that might've been dabbling in electronics five years
    ago, or maybe taking a stab at incorporating a few choreographed dance moves
    into their act are now chucking their drum machines for four-track recorders and
    flange pedals.  It's a movement, baby, and if you're hip enough, you can get in
    on the ground floor!  And hey, truth be told, it's not like the stuff has a
    chance in hell of being popular, so you don't have to worry about someone
    stealing your scene, and... whoa, hold up.  You mean this isn't the next big
    fad?  That puts a damper on me.</p><p>
    
    You see, the thing about the original psych-pop was that it wasn't designed for
    the long haul.  Kids would form a band in high school, play some Them covers,
    and be happy that the prom gig wasn't booked yet.  Then, the bass player would
    fall into some acid, communicate the disease to his friends, and the next thing
    we knew, Jerry Garcia's considered one of the best guitarists of all time.  Well,
    maybe it wasn't exactly like that, but after hearing enough Electric Prunes records,
    I'm wondering if the psychedelic era may have been hiccup in time rather than an
    actual musical movement.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps bands like Beachwood Sparks get around the rather stifling, sub-genre
    dead end by making sure their homages to old-schoolers like Gram Parsons and the
    Byrds are spot-on, and not devoid of actual songwriting.  To be fair, the band
    isn't going straight for the paisley, instead opting for cosmically affected
    country-pop, deep down fairly straightforwardly.  And to be even fairer, this is
    something they have in common with bands like the Byrds, so when in doubt, give
    them the benefit.  <i>Once We Were Trees</i> is their second album.  Let's listen
    in.</p><p>
    
    After a short instrumental prologue (""Germination""), things begin in earnest
    with ""Confusion is Nothing New.""  Running down the checklist, I hear an
    echo-treated mix (maybe a result of the production work of partner-in-crime, J.
    Mascis), drawn-out, lazily enunciated phrasing, slide guitar beamed in from
    Saturn, drone matching twang jab for jab-- yeah, it sounds like hippie music.
    But it's got a good hook and nice vocal harmonies, and you could do a lot worse
    trying to drum up sunny music for the picnic.  I can't understand anything
    they're saying, except for someone telling me not to ""give in to the things
    that take away from you,"" so maybe I should add inspirational freewill
    philosophies to the agenda.</p><p>
    
    This leads to the down-home white funk of ""Sun Surrounds Me,"" and more nasal
    soul than you could find on anyone to the right of John Sebastian.  But again,
    it's got a hook that makes you shake things, and the harmonies are cool.  In
    fact, the subtle details like the Hammond organ licks and unexpected freaky coda
    are so idiomatic I wonder if this stuff isn't more academic than innocuous.
    Bah, I won't bring up any critical bad vibes here.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there's a Sade cover (""By Your Side""), though I think Beachwood Sparks
    have a better handle on sly retro-hipness than she does, and therefore shouldn't
    need to perform ironic cover songs to be cool.  It does sound nice (one of their
    better modes, as far as I can tell), in a ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" kind of way,
    and it's possible that the band simply liked the song, and wanted to play it
    just because.  Rock critics don't handle sincerity very well, so I'll leave you
    with my suspicion that they were only trying to make waves on indie playlists
    with this, and by doing so could inadvertently cement their gimmick-band status.
    Bah, the bad vibes again!</p><p>
    
    Joking aside, I do think bands that know something about the history of their
    music are rare enough, and I admire Beachwood Sparks just on principal.
    Throughout the album, it's obvious just how many old records they must have
    listened to, and it does take a certain love of life to work this hard bringing
    those sounds into the 21st century.  As the album ends, drenched in the fuzzback
    of fantastically hirsute trash-rock (featuring an even more fantastic noisy
    guitar solo), I can start to forgive the similarities the band has with its
    forefathers.  When I take into account that 1) there are actual songs here, not
    just parodies, and 2) most of the tunes were fun to listen to, I remember that
    playing rock-- psychedelic, trashy or otherwise-- doesn't have to be an exercise
    in originality.  Maybe, it just has to be a way to pass the time.  Nothing more
    required on a good day for a light jam and a daydream.</p></div>"|598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/598-once-we-were-trees/|6.6|Dominique Leone

For one thing, it suffers from horrendous misconceptions.
    The fact is, inbreeding between first cousins risks only a 4-5% chance of birth
    defects, slightly less than double that of an ordinary child. Moreover, it
    preserves pedigree. Take canines, for example-- mate two purebreds from the
    same lineage and you're far more likely to win Best in Show. Humans preserve
    pedigree, too, as has occurred with royals for generations (including the current
    Royal House of Windsor) and, of course, my own parents.</p><p>
    
    Orange Can are big on pedigree. Think of them as the Westminster-favorite
    Standard Poodle. The Standard Poodle wears its influences on the outside-- in
    fact, it's precisely because of the traits of its ancestors that the breeder
    ever chose to bring it into existence. The breeder hopes that the best traits
    from the dog's ancestors will commingle, binding the perfect genes in poodles
    for generations to come. The pitfall, however, is as patent as my six-fingered
    brother's cleft lip; if the two dogs both have the same genetic flaw (i.e.
    ""mutant allele"") the mix could result in a freaky genetic disorder, sometimes as
    innocuous as especially bad doggie-halitosis, and others as severe as premature
    death.</p><p>
    
    So it is with London, England's Orange Can. They make psychedelic jam rock that
    draws almost exclusively-- and sometimes indistinguishably-- from their English
    ancestors. These ancestors include the following: Pink Floyd, the Beta Band, and
    the Stone Roses, among others. They also include American quasi-expatriates
    (half-breeds, mutts) like Jimi Hendrix.</p><p>
    
    First off, the positive traits. Orange Can is clearly from the same litter as its
    Regal UK labelmates, the Beta Band. They've inherited a very similar approach to
    song structure, featuring mellow, bass-heavy, psychedelic jams. ""Shoot the
    Morning Sun"" bears that out with sparse, organic percussion (shakers, hand-claps,
    bass drum), a wandering pentatonic bassline, and singer Jason Aslett's lax vocal
    delivery. ""Mornin' Sun,"" easily the most enjoyable track on <i>Home Burns</i>,
    employs similar orchestration, but builds energy into a foot-stomping, full-band R&amp;B; chorus reminiscent of Spiritualized.
    
    Similar kudos go to musicality and production. Guitarist James Aslett borrows
    heavily from the Hendrix-inflected tones of the Stone Roses, in addition to the
    Voodoo Child himself. Bassist Lee Caitlin proves from the opening boogie of ""In
    Your Shoes"" that he has the chops and versatility to give both the blues and
    prog-rock numbers convincing authenticity. On the production end, <i>Home Burns</i>
    almost sounds like a period piece; from the eight-track dirtiness and reverbed
    harmonica of ""Crybaby,"" to the myriad vintage guitar effects, the songs flow
    together with consistency, in spite of their diverse influences.</p><p>
    
    On the other side of Orange Can's musical consanguinity lies its detrimental
    mutant alleles. An influence apparent on many tracks is Pink Floyd. ""Down Where
    She Lays"" opens with a taste of frenetic 70s prog-rock riffing (bass-driven, 5/4
    time), then relaxes into a morose jam highlighted by trippy guitar embellishments.
    ""Ransom"" is another Pink Floyd tribute. Singer Jason Aslett adds lethargic vocals
    over a languid arrangement consisting of simple drums and bass which are
    eventually joined by a soul-free horn arrangement. I never really enjoyed Pink
    Floyd, and Orange Can has successfully reminded me why: the dull, stagnant jams
    sound indifferent and unambitious. And what's worse, unlike Pink Floyd, Orange
    Can can't even claim groundbreaker status. When they suck, it's all derivative--
    almost like they chose to suck on purpose.</p><p>
    
    That said, however, if you're into trippy, nebulous jamming a la Roger Waters and
    friends, you may really enjoy even the weaker tunes on <i>Home Burns</i>. Also,
    the prog-rocking can occasionally be quite engaging, as on the shifty, soulful
    ""Only 15,"" which recalls both King Crimson and the Stone Roses... and Pink Floyd.</p><p>
    
    All in all, Orange Can is an imperfect poodle. The breeders might want to try a
    new mix next time; grab a horny German Shepherd, or a nice looking Chihuahua.
    Something fresh might help Orange Can retain their strengths as musicians, while
    developing their own voice and avoiding blandness.</p></div>"|6018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6018-home-burns/|7.1|Brad Haywood

    down and watched about five straight hours of documentaries on PBS.  Now, I love
    documentaries-- I'm getting to the point where I think I like them more than
    fictional films-- but to sit around for that long and just watch TV is pretty
    unusual for me.  I probably would have gone and done something else after the
    first documentary (a fascinating look at America's scenic waterways) had the
    second one not been about New Zealand.</p><p>
    
    Now, I confess that I knew next to nothing about that quarter of the world
    outside of the WWII era, so a documentary on New Zealand's history piqued my
    interest immediately.  To make a long story short, it was one of those stories
    that makes you feel guilty for being of European descent.  But the country itself
    really is fascinating.  Did you know that sheep outnumber people nearly 20 to 1
    there?  That's a lot of sheep!  Or not a lot of people, as the case seems to be.
    I also find it amusing that the country's air force logo is a kiwi, a bird that
    can't even fly.</p><p>
    
    Anyway, New Zealand, like its big neighbor across the Tasman Sea, Australia,
    has managed to develop a unique culture of its own since separating from the
    British Empire last century.  And, also like Australia, New Zealand has
    developed a fairly singular, identifiable music scene of its own.  The New
    Zealand Sound, if it can be said to exist, usually laces rhythmic post-punk
    with a heavy acid tab of psychedelia, and few bands can be said to embody it
    as well as the Clean.  This seems logical, of course, as the Clean were one
    of the first bands with that sound.  Upon their formation in 1978, they were one
    of the few New Zealand bands playing strictly their own material, and they were
    to prove hugely influential in their homeland despite their limited recorded
    output.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, they didn't record their first full-length album, <i>Vehicle</i>, until
    1990, after reuniting.  Since then, the Clean has been an on-again, off-again
    prospect, with the three members coming away from their other projects every
    so often to record an album or tour.  Listening to <i>Getaway</i>-- only the
    band's fourth proper album over the course of 23 years-- is enough to make me
    wish they'd stay together more often.</p><p>
    
    To be clear, let's first assert that <i>Getaway</i> isn't really an especially
    innovative or earth-shattering record.  Neither, however, is it a typical
    recording for a middle-aged band, content to simply tread the same old path
    without turning over any new rocks to see what's underneath.  In fact, <i>Getaway</i>
    sounds remarkably youthful, split between brief, upbeat rockers, and longer,
    more meditative swaths of noisy psych.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with ""Stars,"" which is something of a middle ground between the
    two extremes.  It's full of droning distortion and restrained rhythm section
    playing, but also throws some enticing vocals hooks into the mix, delivered in
    David Kilgour's laid-back vocal style.  ""Jala"" follows, steering the tone toward
    trance-inducing psychedelia with its alternate guitar tunings, thrummed piano
    strings, pitched percussion, and droning, wah'd guitar parts.</p><p>
    
    This strategy is returned to several times over the course of the album, most
    notably on ""Alpine Madness"" and ""Circle Canyon,"" both of which feature Yo La
    Tengo's Georgia Hubley and Ira Kaplan.  ""Alpine Madness,"" in particular, has the
    pentatonic mantra thing going-- it's sort of like the Byrds' ""Mind Gardens,""
    except that David Crosby isn't singing out of tune on top of it, and therefore,
    it doesn't absolutely suck.  ""Circle Canyon"" continues in the same vein, but
    ushers in percussion and sets you up for the album's mightiest track, ""Aho.""</p><p>
    
    ""Aho"" begins with some of David Kilgour's signature bluesy, wah'd guitar backed
    by brother Hamish's ultra-dark cymbals, before Robert Scott's melodic bassline
    starts grooving like hell and the whole band launches into a crazy jam. Kilgour's
    vocals reside near the middle of the mix, sharing space with his guitar, and
    often forgoing lyrics completely for spontaneous adlibing.  The band also makes
    excellent use of stereo panning, setting the scratchy, muted guitar in the left
    speaker and the harmonic parts in the right, which makes headphone listening
    that much more rewarding.</p><p>
    
    The album's shorter pieces come basically in two varieties: short, tuneful
    instrumentals like ""Cell Block No. 5""(which features some nice sax parts) and
    ""Holdin' On,"" and sharply penned songs like ""Poor Boy,"" which would make a fine
    single.  Dense, heavily layered guitar parts like the ones on this album can
    have a tendency to drown otherwise good melodies, but that's generally avoided
    here, as the band seems to have a pretty good sense for what the audience needs
    to hear.</p><p>
    
    Taken as a whole, <i>Getaway</i> is a fine record from a band of seasoned veterans.
    Old fans are almost certainly going to be thrilled with this, and I wouldn't be
    surprised if a few new ones climbed aboard.  If there's any complaint you could
    level at the Clean at this stage in their career, it's that occasionally they'll
    find themselves wandering without much purpose, but in wandering, they usually
    end up someplace intriguing rather quickly.  Once the album's over, all there
    is left to do is hope that they hurry out with the next one.</p></div>"|1493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1493-getaway/|7.6|Joe Tangari

    The <i>really</i> old Pitchfork reader might remember when <i>Spy</i> was
    actually funny. <i>Spy</i> was an 80s publication all the way, and their sardonic
    blade was perfectly forged for carving up that particular decade. Once the 90s
    hit, <i>Spy</i> started to suck, and smarter, more ambitious mags like <i>Might</i>,
    <i>Vice</i>, and, well, <i>Suck</i>, filled the void.</p><p>
<i>Spy</i> used to have a regular feature called ""Logrolling in Our Time."" The
    idea behind the piece was to find examples of two writers criticizing each
    other's books at the same time, each giving the other a glowing review. You'd
    find a quote from Tom McGuane, say, going on about what a genius Jim Harrison
    was, and then next to that would be a quote from Harrison praising to the skies
    McGuane's latest opus. The idea being that literary criticism was an incestuous,
    backslapping, one-hand-washes-the-other kind of deal.</p><p>
    
    I bring this up in the context of a Weights and Measures review as a means of
    full disclosure: I'm pals with the bass player from the band. You might feel
    like you know him, too, because he's none other than former <i>Pitchfork</i>
    writer Samir Khan, sworn enemy of folky pub bands from Great Big Sea to shining
    sea.  Like Patti Smith, Neil Tennant and Ira Kaplan before him, Samir decided to
    leave the glamorous and personally fulfilling world of music criticism for the
    dull workaday grind of life in a rock band. Or rock bands, I should say, because
    Samir splits time between the aggro math-rock of Weights and Measures and the
    quiet, dreamy slowcore of Kepler.</p><p>
    
    Weights and Measures released an eponymous album in 2000, which I enjoyed for
    its punishing sound and, on ""Skipping School on the First Day,"" the longest
    between-riff pause I've ever heard.  This song is incredible-- I can run to the
    store and get a half-rack of beer in the silence between crunches.  Now, the
    three men from Ottawa return with the short, punchy and satisfying EP, <i>Tonight,
    the Lower Abdominals</i>. Here we have six instrumental songs that tear by in 14
    minutes. Seriously, these tracks <i>book</i>.  Catchy and to the point, each
    basically serves to explore variations on a single well-constructed riff.</p><p>
    
    Fall is upon us, but this is summer music. In fact, I didn't completely tune into
    <i>Tonight, The Lower Abdominals</i> until I heard ""The Economics of Looking Good""
    blasting out of the factory deck of my Honda Civic, the copious distortion
    augmented by my seriously clipping 2.5 watts per channel amplifier. The complex
    drumming is tighter than Mark Knopfler's headband, basslines are fluid and
    tuneful, and the guitar alternates between jagged post-punk riffing and tense
    melodic counterpoint.</p><p>
    
    The melodies here are stronger than on the debut, and an overwhelming sense of
    joy that comes through. Weights and Measures sound like they're having the time
    of their lives playing this driving, dynamic music, and I thank God and Angus
    Young (not necessarily in that order) that I live in a country where this music
    is not considered noise pollution.</p></div>"|8615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8615-tonight-the-lower-abdominals-ep/|7.6|Mark Richard-San

    loosely, the process whereby rich people ""discover"" an interesting working-class
    neighborhood, then drive up rents until ""most of the original working-class
    occupiers are displaced and the whole social character of the district is
    changed.""  It's a sad phenomenon, but one that seems to have pervaded even the
    music industry; for example, look what happened to the blues, formerly the
    domain of forlorn, loveless sages like Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson. Nowadays,
    you can record with Babyface, and still have the ""blues"" (see Eric Clapton). In
    the same vein, when Rod Stewart, once the purveyor of gritty, determined R&amp;B;
    (see the Faces), discovered spandex, the masses discovered him, and he began his
    own gradual retardation.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, in a different sense, gentrification also corrupted hip-hop. Back
    in the Golden Era of the late 80s and early 90s, hip-hop borrowed liberally from
    the pop and funk catalog of the prior decades, churning out beats that were at
    times fierce (Eric B and Rakim, Kool G Rap and DJ Polo), at times jazzy (A Tribe
    Called Quest, Brand Nubian) and at times political (Public Enemy, Boogie Down
    Productions). It sounded good and it meant something, but most of all, it was
    accessible. A DJ didn't need a bankroll to sample ""Funky Drummer"" (which
    remarkably found its way onto over 150 tracks).</p><p>
    
    Enter Gilbert O'Sullivan. Upset that Biz Markie and other young black men were
    making money, O'Sullivan decided he wanted a piece of the action. In 1991, he
    sued the Biz for his sample of O'Sullivan's 1972 love ballad, ""Alone Again
    (Naturally)."" Naturally, Markie lost the lawsuit, and naturally, that put the
    brakes on the breaks, so to speak-- unless artists obtained permission, and paid
    stiff premiums, the law deemed sampling to be theft. The only ones left with the
    means to pay for samples were major labels. Thus, while P. Diddy could lift
    anything from the Police's ""Every Breath You Take"" to Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir,""
    working class artists were priced out of the beat market. Left ""beatless,"" just
    as the working-class were left homeless, hip-hop was effectively gentrified.</p><p>
    
    Amidst gentrification, some DJs languished, but others just dug deeper. Count
    among the beat-miners DJ Spinna, mastermind of Brooklyn's underground duo
    Jigmastas, whose debut LP, <i>Infectious</i>, sports some of the most creative,
    palatable grooves recorded in years. And deep for Spinna is pretty damn deep;
    fuck Gilbert O'Sullivan-- we're talking tap-dancing-instruction-deep; the basic
    steps of a tap teacher, and her cryptic marching orders, form the backbone for
    the album's best (and maybe the year's best) jam, ""Don't Get It Twisted.""</p><p>
    
    ""Twisted"" is reminiscent of post-Puba Brand Nubian, not just in the Sadat X cameo,
    but definitely in the groove.  With the same kind of danceable, straight-up funk
    track that drove tunes like ""The Travel Jam,"" the song is emblematic of Spinna's
    talents; every element of every song plays a part in the groove. Even his obscure
    samples (tap dance, tower bells) embellish drum breaks, introduce melody, or add
    ambience. It's almost too seamless to be underground.</p><p>
    
    ""Lyrical Mastery"" is another Spinna masterpiece. The song builds around a sparse,
    syncopated six-note organ riff and a simple breakbeat funky enough to chill your
    spine. The highlight reel rolls at the chorus, which is built from snippets of
    classic raps (nine in total, though not all recognizable). Unbelievably, the
    fabricated chorus not only rhymes, but makes sense.</p><p>
    
    Lest we forget, the beneficiary of Spinna's beats, and the other half of
    Jigmastas, is a talented MC named Kriminul. Kriminul has a quick, clear, tenor
    delivery that doesn't call too much attention to itself, but blends in nicely
    with Spinna's production style. Kriminul's rhymes are usually intelligent and
    witty, although they occasionally suffer moments of blandness (being played by
    women, the police, other MCs). I'd set the ""dope-to-wack"" ratio on Kriminul's
    rhymes at about 3:1. Krim is by far at his most vapid on ""Hollar,"" featuring a
    guitar cameo by Living Colour's Vernon Reid, which laments racial profiling with
    the chorus, ""Why are you stressing me, wasting all my time?/ Time is money, why
    you searching through my ride?/ Cuz' I was cruising, minding my business/ What
    was I doing?/ You make me wanna hollar."" As mentioned, though, Krim hits the
    target about 75% of the time, which is more than you can say for most MCs.</p><p>
    
    As it goes, gentrification ruins the old neighborhood. But the old ""neighbors""
    have to go somewhere. The Jigmastas went underground, and have come forth with
    an LP as listener-friendly as it is creative and funky. This time, we can only
    hope that the tap-dance industry doesn't gentrify the underground.</p></div>"|4253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4253-infectious/|8.0|Brad Haywood

I mean that in the same
    sort of way you might say, with simpering pride or dull resignation, ""I've been
    with my girlfriend forever""; or, obstetrically speaking, ""I've been with child"";
    or even, congenitally speaking-- and best of luck to you-- ""I've been with spina
    bifida.""  Thankfully, no one will be wed, dumped, birthed, or subjected to
    painful corrective spinal surgery as a result of this album.  And yet, the week
    I've spent with it feels like months or years in album-time.  An ordeal.</p><p>
    
    With ordeals come the necessary shifting perspectives and vacillating opinions,
    which can be at turns violent and sudden, or geologically gradual in pace.  My
    first session with <i>Go Forth</i> was marked by extreme interest, but tainted
    by slight disappointment.  On subsequent listens, the disappointment gave way to
    total addiction.  And, as tends to happen with addictions, I eventually burned
    out on these 12 songs and left them cold turkey.  Predictably, though, I was
    soon back in their grip, if aware of their shortcomings.</p><p>
    
    On ""Adoptuction,"" a hilarious ode to a Stockholm Syndrome dream, Tim Harrington
    sings, ""The haggling went on for days/ The days went on for weeks/ And weeks for
    years."" And so it went with my appraisal of this album. It's been a kind of
    bargaining process. I sat at one side of the table, lowballing the merit of
    the record in relation to <i>3/5</i>, <i>The Cat and the Cobra</i>, and
    especially the sparkling <i>Rome (Written Upside Down)</i> EP. The album,
    however, wouldn't budge.  And, like a seasoned junk-peddler at a bazaar hawking
    an obviously flawed but highly covetable art object, it edged me inch by inch
    until I was pretty damn near the original asking price.</p><p>
    
    Pardon that goofy simile while I get on to some specifics.  With indie mainstay
    Phil Ek producing, the RISD-born Brooklyn four-piece have assembled a maddeningly
    spacy, fairly inconsistent, but very rich set of songs that capitalize on the
    leftover space from guitarist Gibb Slife's departure.  As it turns out, it's not
    quite on par with what last year's <i>Rome</i> EP promised, but it's also not
    without its virtues.</p><p>
    
    ""Tragic Monsters"" is a beautiful opener, awash in whirring guitar lines and
    keyboard fuzz that become indistinguishable from one another. Harrington's
    lyrics are as droll, piquant, and fun as ever. His word games, as such, aren't
    exactly works of genius, and it seems a favorite past-time of some people to
    point this out.  What I think those people fail to appreciate is how consistently
    Harrington is able to combine charming alliteration, funny turns of phrase,
    imagistically inventive scenarios, and thematic cohesion, and ply them all to
    the rhythmic demands of his more-often-than-not good-ass melodies. If you
    offhandedly disregard his lyrics because they seem silly and sophomoric, you're
    missing the big picture.</p><p>
    
    ""Reprobate's Resume"" is strange, beginning with an odd introductory section that
    bears little relation to the song's main body.  ""Blessed be the doctor/ And
    blessed be the nurse/ Blessed be the coachman/ Who put me in the hearse,""
    spits Harrington over a skeletal drum and distorted guitar riff arrangement.
    The song's peak comes at the end, as its fading rock percussion yields to the
    dubby, echo-washed drum track of ""Crawling Can Be Beautiful.""</p><p>
    
    ""Crawling"" reveals itself as pure late-70s British-- all Wire, Clash, and Gang
    of Four, yet distinctly Les Savy Fav: ""Who here finds this world distracting/
    Who here finds this world a bore/ Who here thinks we're all play-acting/ And that
    the show's piss poor?""  Meanwhile, ""Disco Drive,"" which integrates electronics
    into the mix more convincingly than any of the prior songs, is the one track
    that could have easily come off the <i>Rome</i> EP.  In the overall scheme of
    this album, though, it's just an aperitif for the absurdly catchy track that
    follows.</p><p>
    
    ""The Slip"" takes telekinetic control of your ass like it was a gluteal remote
    control.  Harrison Haynes' sick disco dance beat and Syd Butler's slippery
    bassline comprise what has to be one of the most immediately likeable moments
    of rock in the past five years. The sugar wears, as of course it must, but for
    the first few listens-- and probably all subsequent ones if you space them
    out reasonably-- this track will convince you of Les Savy Fav's singular role
    in today's sad state of rock. Of weird note is the fact that both ""Disco Drive""
    and ""The Slip"" sound very much like late-80s the Cure, only substituting the
    insufferably plaintive Robert Smith with Harrington's frenetic wails.</p><p>
    
    ""Daily Dares,"" though apparently serving some purpose in terms of track sequence,
    is on its own forgettable.  Things get back to good on ""One to Three,"" though, a
    quirky ballad that's as much Pink Floyd (wait, come back!) as the Pixies. Some
    of the album's finest moments are to be found on the aforementioned ""Adoptuction""
    and the album's penultimate track (and final song proper), ""Bloom On Demand,""
    the latter showing off Seth Jabour's always sharp guitar bursts and snakey lines.</p><p>
    
    Though not quite the aural scorched-earth campaign you'd have hoped for if you,
    too, were slaughtered by <i>Rome (Written Upside Down)</i>, <i>Go Forth</i> is
    nonetheless going to make most people's year-end lists, and is more than reason
    enough to catch any of Les Savy Fav's famous live shows. These songs, a force in
    their own right, will sear in person, even if they're merely hot to the touch on
    record.</p></div>"|4748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4748-go-forth/|7.6|Camilo Arturo Leslie

Just months after their self-titled debut on     Kindercore, sugary-sweet West coast popsters Call and Response have released     essentially the same album on Emperor Norton. But before you can ask, ""Why is     this necessary,"" let me explain that the album has two more songs on it this     time around, and the songs have been re-sequenced for a smoother listening     experience. Plus, nearly the whole shebang has been re-mixed by Mickey Petralia,     who's probably best known for producing the Butthole Surfers' <em>Electriclarryland</em> and Beck's <em>Midnite Vultures</em></p><p>.</p><p>Okay, now you can ask, ""Why is this necessary?""</p>
<p>Well, to be cynical, it's necessary because what was already ultra-catchy, bouncy,     super-whitebread, honky-lips funk-pop has received an extra coat of gloss in a     bid for a cameo spot on the upcoming season of ""Felicity"" or the next 80s retro     flick starring Janeane Garofalo.  And if that isn't enough for you, well, good.</p>
<p>But to fair (and I have no idea if this is what they were gunning for, but I'm     guessing no), this album is pretty depressing, precisely because it's so naively     bright and rosy. You wish things were as great as this album makes them out to     be-- that everything could be about ""Blowin' Bubbles,"" ""Rollerskating,"" and     pre-disappointment school crushes. But those days are over, right? You're bruised     and jaded now, and this reminder only comes as some sorta ironically perverse     jab in the ribs.</p>
<p>It reminds me of when, after years of sleeping in, I woke up early on a Saturday     morning to watch cartoons, hoping to catch old friends like Foghorn Leghorn and     Daffy Duck, only to find out they don't show cartoons on Saturday morning much     anymore. They've all been replaced with teen soap-coms, the hideous bastard genre     jumpstarted by <em>Saved by the Bell</em>.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, the album.  If you happened to miss Call and Response the first time     around, here's the gist of it:  they're a five-piece whose calling card is slick     boy/girl harmonies. Such dubious influences as the Lovin' Spoonful, the Mamas     and the Papas, and the Archies offer a distinctly American slant to the Swed-core     lineage of ABBA, Ace of Base, and most notably in Call and Response's case,     Roxette and the Cardigans. Like most candy floss-pop, what's interesting here     isn't the songs or the playing. It could be anyone (and probably is) playing     anything. What's interesting is how a producer, engineer, or mixer can create a     perfect machine for planting a melody firmly in your skull. And if that whole     process is what gets you excited, here's twelve great subjects to dissect: two     more than the original, and twice as sweet.</p>
<p>Or maybe this will do the trick: ""You've got to know how to stop when you do the     bunny hop,"" from ""Rollerskate."" What more can I say? The choice is obvious. You     need both versions. Let your record collector geekdom take over. You'd do it for     the Locust.</p>

    act. Or maybe a revivalist vaudevillian comedy duo. Or possibly a Cheech and Chong
    cover band.  But no.  John Fahey casts a long, pitch-black shadow across the
    landscape of instrumental, finger-picked, steel-stringed acoustic guitar music
    from which few Guild-slingers can escape.  And now that the man has passed away,
    expect a barrage of hero-worshipping imitators to try and fill his shoes.
    Needless to say, it ain't gonna happen.  The nice thing about Chicago's Bosco
    and Jorge is that they seem to recognize this. They make no attempts to disguise
    their love for Fahey-- instead wearing it proudly like a badge-- and as ardent
    fans, they end up making something that rises slightly above a simple homage.
    Or in Oedipal terms: they try to kill the father by beating him at his own game.</p><p>
    It makes sense that Bosco and Jorge (actually Bill Lowman and Brad Gallagher) met
    as kids at a concert of Fahey protegé Leo Kottke. But far from third-rate Fahey,
    <i>Bosco and Jorge</i> is actually better than anything Kottke's put out in a
    long time.  It's even better than a lot of Fahey albums I've heard.  There are
    other touchstones here, of course: Bert Jansch, Nick Drake, and Fahey influences
    like Skip James, Mississippi John Hurt, and Bill Monroe.  And if you wear your
    hipster shades, you'll be able to discern the ghosts of these predecessors within
    the overwhelming Fahey glare reflecting off this album.</p><p>
    For Bosco and Jorge, Fahey's best music was made from the mid-60s to the early
    70s. They largely ignore his latter-day excursions into noise, and steer clear
    of his raga and Middle Eastern motifs, instead focusing on his Appalachian work.
    ""Sorta Play That Sorta Stuff,"" the lead-off track, sees the duo at their most
    imitative.  Other instruments are added elsewhere, but here, they use only two
    guitars which begin on a mournful note before picking up speed and interlocking.
    Fahey's <i>Requia</i> springs immediately to mind.  ""Two Steps Behind in the 1st
    Place"" follows, opening with a very somber and hushed guitar pattern before
    flutes soar in and flirt atop. If there's such a thing as autumnal samba, this
    is it.</p><p>
    ""Mikey's Pole"" is the standout track. Bowed bass and cello provide the foundation
    for probably the most evocative guitar riff to be found here.  Subtle but
    powerful, it uses harmonic taps in a way that isn't just mere claptrap-- a true
    rarity.  Banjo takes the lead role for the first movement of the 11-minute
    ""Lil' Smokie.""  A howling voice reminiscent of Tim Buckley (circa <i>Lorca</i>)
    soon takes over before returning to a halting and playful solo guitar interlude
    that builds to a frantic pace that would be sure to send <i>Guitar World</i>'s
    readership to the Internet in search of tablature if they ever caught wind of it.</p><p>
    The Fahey-isms return in full force with ""Niagara,"" as the two-guitar attack of
    the first track is resumed.  But far from funereal, this piece is upbeat and
    vibrant. ""17 Year Cicada"" rounds out the album and comes closest to mapping out
    fresh musical territory, as Lowman and Gallagher branch out and add piano, drums,
    and an ever-so-slight touch of electric guitar that builds to a minor crescendo
    like a less bombastic Godspeed.</p></div>"|873.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/873-bosco-and-jorge/|6.9|Jason Nickey

So says the title of the closing track from their 1997 stunner
    debut, <i>Young Team</i>. This one song title has bewildered me more than any
    other in all of my musical excursions-- even more so than Roger Waters' ""Several
    Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a
    Pict"" from Pink Floyd's <i>Ummagumma</i>.  Perhaps that confusion was caused
    more by the song itself rather than its title.  But whereas ""Several Species""
    takes the cake for evoking the most invigorated ""turn off that infernal racket""
    responses, ""Mogwai Fear Satan"" represents all that's good about olympic post-rock:
    a driving theme, huge extended crescendos, a blatant climax, and a few orchestral
    instruments thrown in to boot.  Sure, it's all cliché these days, but it's no
    less affecting or indispensable now than it was four years ago.</p><p>
    As for the title, I attended church enough to know that Christians are to fear
    God and his ever-looming wrath. Conversely, Christians are not to fear Satan,
    as Jesus Christ has plans to do away with him when the time comes. So should
    this be interpreted as Satan worship?  Juvenile provocation?  Or are Mogwai
    genuinely frightened by all that's diabolical?  Not a bit. Any time spent with
    the ultraviolent ""Like Herod"" rules that last one out.</p><p>
    Perhaps it's important to consider that the base melody for Mogwai's <i>My Father
    My King</i> is extracted from a Jewish hymn traditionally sung on Rosh Hashanah,
    the Jewish New Year, which pleads to God for grace in spite of sins committed.
    While the track is performed as an instrumental, a translation of the hymn is
    included in the liner notes to this single-track EP: ""Inscribe us for blessing
    in thy book of life."" It all boils down to whether Mogwai actually intend for
    those implications to arise, or if they were just really into this fab Jewish
    melody that electro-wiz Arthur Baker taught them.</p><p>
<i>My Father My King</i> may be a formulaic return to Mogwai's epic canon, but
    there's no denying that these 20 minutes reaffirm faith in this Glaswegian
    quintet. This year's <i>Rock Action</i>, while nice enough, was anything but
    satisfying in light of Mogwai's overpowering live performances, or even recent
    outings like <i>EP+2</i>. But it's no accident that <i>My Father My King</i> is
    being marketed as a companion to <i>Rock Action</i>: this demonstration of might
    and dynamic is exactly what that album lacked.</p><p>
    Mogwai waste no time introducing the middle-eastern, mid-tempo theme that will be
    reiterated and metamorphosed throughout the entire track.  It begins with a lone,
    dry-signaled electric guitar in the right channel, which is followed by another
    in the left.  Soon, drums enter with a steady, simplistic beat, miked to
    subwoofer-damaging perfection by Steve Albini.  The two guitars diverge as the
    bass enters, continuing the melody in synched harmony.  As the tension builds to
    capacity, and the death-metal fuzz distortion pedals are activated, the bass
    expands enough to shake the neighbor's rafters, and the drums crash perpetually.</p><p>
    Around the six-minute mark, the song calms with some light ambient noise from
    one of the guitars, but gradually builds again to a second peak as the bass
    acquires its own distortion and a guitar noodles in the higher registers with a
    pitchshifter. Sixteen minutes marks collapse into phaser heaven feedback and
    fuzz harmonics, then white noise.  During the final four minutes, the song grinds,
    locomotive-like, to a screeching halt, with the phased feedback dramatically cut
    off mid-iteration.  For the most part, the song's structure seems standard in the
    world of olympic post-rock. But unlike <i>Rock Action</i>, this recording doesn't
    just push the envelope; it shoves.</p><p>
    ""My Father My King"" had become a live staple before its commitment to tape, and
    Albini quite faithfully captures the concentrated force.  Notorious for noise
    flirtation even in his major label days, Albini makes ""no-holds-barred"" a
    rallying cry as Mogwai kick their rendition into utter chaos.  I haven't heard
    anything this fat and heavy since I spun Barry White and Rage Against the Machine
    simultaneously during a schizophrenic frat party DJ set. No, I wasn't drunk. I
    was experimenting.</p><p>
    Which isn't exactly what Mogwai is doing.  Of all post-rock's domineering forces,
    Mogwai are the most capable of kicking the genre where it hurts.  Yet, I'm still
    confused by the religious connotations.  Is it possible to have Jewish death-metal?
    And should I even be considering such interpretational matters?</p></div>"|5366.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5366-my-father-my-king-ep/|8.6|Christopher F. Schiel

    heart, inspiring the most heartfelt poetry ever committed to paper? Months went
    by and slowly you initiated an awkward friendship. Then one day, in a callow act
    of unadulterated love that has forever mitigated your ability to emote, you dumped
    all three notebooks of that semantically challenged crap on her, knowing that if
    she were to just read through the first ten pages she would come running back.</p><p>
    
    Remember how she didn't? Well, that qualifies you to empathize with Slug of
    Minneapolis-based Atmosphere. Taking leave of his myriad hip-hop commitments
    (notably Anticon and Deep Puddle Dynamics), Slug embarks on the lyrical exorcism
    of the deified love of his life, Lucy Ford, on an album culled from three
    EPs formerly available only on vinyl.</p><p>
    
    The rhymes often bounce between insightful social observation (a la Saul Williams)
    and authentic old-school wordplay, making for great late-night ear candy. Such
    is the case with ""Aspiring Sociopath,"" in which Slug marrs the sacred cow that
    is ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" (as well as other classic radio staples) as he
    desperately depicts the realities of a latter-day American road warrior who
    can only find solace and connection in the songs that blare on his car stereo.
    Elsewhere, you can almost hear the mental pages of wry sophomore poetry being
    turned. ""I bet my fans know me better than my friends do/ Because my friends
    don't pay that much attention/ The fans memorize every single sentence/ Which
    makes them far too smart to ever start a friendship.""</p><p>
    
    But it's the eclectic and forbidding samples that make the disc a stark slice of
    modern Americana. The Mingus-style bass freak-out of ""It Goes,"" the climactic
    refrain of ""O' Holy Night"" wafting through ""If I Was Santa Claus""-- Atmosphere
    don't have the money to sample Sting and they're not afraid to show it. Rather,
    they make the most out of nothing and utilize their gloriously dirty production
    to great effect. Occasionally, it seems to be their recording technique which
    purveys a great deal of the album's intimacy rather than the content.</p><p>
    
    Whatever it is, it seems to work on varying degrees and fails completely only
    once.  While Slug's direct comments to his enigmatic Lucy character are normally
    provoking, ""Don't Ever Fucking Question That"" stands out as that one overtly
    obsessive poem written in an emotionally inebriated state that sent your second
    chances at true high school romance down the shitter (along with your notebooks).
    Luckily, the song is crammed between two of the album's best tracks and its
    duration could be used to roll down the windows, slow down the car, and dial up
    Nicole.</p></div>"|340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/340-lucy-ford-the-atmosphere-eps/|7.3|Kevin Adickes

This is a question
    that sociologists have concerned themselves with since Black Sabbath's self-titled
    debut appeared four years after the premier of the original ""Star Trek."" How
    could the belligerent anger of the metal geeks ever mesh with the pathetic
    pseudo-scientific leanings of the sci-fi nerds?  Some have theorized that the
    question will never really be answered. Others envision a worldwide nerd
    revolution, like <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i>, but possibly without the gratuitous
    nudity scene.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Double Exposure</i>, sci-fi nerds Trans Am and metal geeks/70s corporate
    rock guitar solo aficionados the Fucking Champs join together in an unholy
    alliance appropriately dubbed TransChamps. The collaboration has near-infinite
    potential. Both Trans Am and the Fucking Champs have an astounding ability to
    turn laughable retro cheese into something thoroughly listenable, fun, and
    driving.</p><p>
    
    In a perfect world, this collaboration between the Champs and Trans Am would
    bring together the very best of retro fetishism in a catchy, goofy, energetic
    mix. ""Give It to You,"" the first track on <i>Double Exposure</i> hints at a
    promise of such a brilliant synthesis. The song opens with the Fucking Champs'
    trademark crunchy guitar riffing. But Trans Am immediately makes their presence
    known with hilariously ridiculous vocals. Imagine a guy with a slightly off-key
    baritone saying things like, ""C'mon, little girl/ It's time for school/
    De-evolution/ On the streets/ A revolution/ In the sheets,"" over synchronized
    corporate rock guitar solos, and perhaps you'll get an idea of just how awesome
    ""Give It to You"" really is-- and how excellent <i>Double Exposure</i> as a whole
    might have been.</p><p>
    
    On ""The Big Machine,"" Trans Am's futuristic sound dominates, with tinny trashcan
    percussion and burbly synthesizers. Unfortunately, the song never cashes in on
    its potential. When the Fucking Champs' unique guitar stylings finally do come
    in, they simply sound tacked-on, seeming as out-of-place as Blue Oyster Cult
    would in an episode of ""Voyager.""</p><p>
    
    The following suite, ""First Comes Sunday Morning"" and ""Then Comes Saturday Night,""
    utterly redeems the track, though, showcasing two different treatments for a
    single musical theme. The former is an acoustic guitar, string, and piano-laden
    foray into whimsy the likes of which is never really approached elsewhere on
    this EP.  On ""Then Comes Saturday Night,"" that whimsy is coupled with some
    synchronized guitar soloing, double bass and heavy drumming. Strange effects are
    piled on, and the song builds to a powerful climax of heavily distorted guitars
    and bleeping synthesizers.</p><p>
    
    It probably would have been a good idea to end <i>Double Exposure</i> on ""Then
    Comes Saturday Night."" Instead, we're treated to ""Somebody Like You,"" a moody,
    cheesily downcast number that never develops into much. While parts of this
    record truly do bring together the best of two similarly fun bands, the worst
    parts just sound like two different bands playing songs with each other, and
    never succeeding at combining their sounds into a cohesive final product. So it
    seems the question on everybody's minds hasn't quite been answered. But <i>Double
    Exposure</i> certainly suggests that a more in-depth collaboration between these
    two great bands could lead to a nerd alliance the likes of which the world has
    never seen, and the ramifications of which remain unknown.</p></div>"|8141.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8141-double-exposure-ep/|7.9|Matt LeMay

    or two examples of their best material, some filler, and maybe a cover tune thrown
    in to give listeners a ready-made reference point. But for other bands, the EP
    provides a perfect dose of what they have to offer.  New York's Elk City fit in
    the latter category. Their music, while lush and often captivating, gets tiring
    over the long haul. The trio's debut, for example, 2000's <i>Status</i>,
    contained many memorable highlights, but as a whole, it overstayed its welcome
    with too many similarly paced songs.</p><p>
<i>The Sea is Fierce</i>, a new five song EP, is much more flattering to the
    band's blend of urban psych-folk. Guitar, drums, and various keyboards (especially
    Rhodes) combine to create a mood similar to Galaxie 500, Low, or Cowboy Junkies,
    but more willing to take the BPM count up a few notches on occasion.  The vocal
    duties are pretty evenly split between Peter Langland-Hassan, who also
    plays guitar, and Reneé LoBue, who handles most of the keyboard work. This
    dynamic between male and female singers, when utilized in the same song, creates
    a vague tension and uneasiness.  But then, you get the feeling this isn't being
    used to its full potential: the lyrics are often just too cloudy to pull it off.</p><p>
    The first thing you hear on this EP is the fiery guitar workout by Langland-Hassan
    which opens ""Take Me Out,"" sounding incredibly similar to the theme from ""Kids in
    the Hall"" (only much grittier), and the rest of the band rocks out following his
    lead. But by the one-minute mark, their meds kick in-- either that, or they're
    all submerged in some kind of super-viscous fluid, slowing things to a sludgy
    crawl. This is when LoBue's sultry moan, sounding not unlike ex-Mazzy Star singer
    Hope Sandoval or Over the Rhine's Karin Bergquist, enters: melancholy, hypnotic,
    and above all, nocturnal. The lyrics take a backseat to the singing, though--
    something about how ""the state I'm in is not my state of mind,"" and how her
    brother likes the Who and the Kinks-- along with distorted, reverb-soaked vocal
    interjections by her counterpart. It's all a little unclear. Elk City is all
    about mood and atmospherics; if you're looking for narrative, look elsewhere.</p><p>
    After about four minutes, Langland-Hassan gets bored and decides his guitar needs
    to take over again, stomping on the distortion pedal and going for guitar-god
    status. This goes on for about four more minutes (which means we're nearing the
    nine minute-mark here with this opening song, for those of you not keeping score).
    And I said this band was better in small portions, right?  Well, right.
    Thankfully, they only pull this kind of thing once on <i>The Sea is Fierce</i>.
    But the solo actually isn't that bad. Far from gratuitous or over-indulgent, it
    actually hangs around only as long as it needs to. Listening to it, I could
    finally kind of hear the link between Peter Buck's concise college rock riffs
    and the near-eternal distortion sculptures Neil Young creates in concert.</p><p>
    With ""Turpentine,"" the chairs are switched: Langland-Hassan takes the lead vocal
    seat and LoBue provides a refrain of sorts. Essentially, it's an organ-driven
    come-down number with a much more sober and shorter guitar solo bridge.
    Langland-Hassan's voice, when unaltered by effects, comes awfully close to
    sounding like a Tom Verlaine imitation (not that this is a bad thing). This is
    best heard on the upbeat, almost pop-punkish ""Three Ears,"" which paradoxically
    sees the band come closest to throwing off the shackles of their combined
    influences. There's one particular line in the song (""big tits are never enough"")
    that seems out of place and threatens to derail the whole thing, but taken in
    context, it's not really all that bad.</p><p>
    A cover of Galaxie 500's ""Strange"" from their 1989 classic, <i>On Fire</i>, comes
    next. It's always a little disappointing when a band covers a song by an glaringly
    obvious influence-- it just seems like they're not trying-- but Elk City stamp
    this one with enough personality to let it slide. ""Bar Song"" finishes off the EP
    with a modernist take on the nineteenth century sea chantey, with very Mercury
    Rev-esque singing-saw accompaniment courtesy of the Music Tapes' Julian Koster.</p><p>
    The whole thing is over in about 25 minutes, which is just about right. It's hard
    to see how Elk City could sustain a listener's interest for much longer than this
    without significant additions to either their musical or lyrical vocabulary.
    They've got a few promising tools at their disposal: a great guitarist (with
    maybe a slight tendency to wank, but properly harnessed, it could be used for
    the Forces of Good) and two distinctive vocalists.  But these seductions are
    short-lived, and once you've settled into the band's sound, there's not much
    else to keep you occupied. The key ingredient they're missing, and what separates
    them for the time being from, say, Low, is that elusive quintessence: strong
    songwriting.</p></div>"|2750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2750-the-sea-is-fierce-ep/|6.4|Jason Nickey

Sure, over the last year or two my
    tastes in music have swung drastically toward the experimental and the
    avant-garde. But no matter how much noise I've listened to, I've always managed
    to retain my love for the straight-up pop song. After all, were it not for power
    chords and lush melodies, it's unlikely I ever would have bothered to step foot
    in a record store to begin with. If nothing else, I owe pop music a debt for
    first grabbing my ear and refusing to let go.</p><p>
    This is why, when I listened to Beulah's <i>The Coast is Never Clear</i> for the
    first time, I got worried. This disc is loaded with pretty melodies, classic pop
    hooks, loud guitars over layers of strings and horns, and even the occasional
    ragtime piano or steel guitar, all built on a foundation of harmonic
    ba-dop-bop-bops. And yet, for some reason, nothing about it grabbed me. I began
    to fear the worst. Had the Nihilistic Spasm Bands and Acid Mothers Temples of
    the world spoiled pop music for me?</p><p>
    After a few listens, it all came into focus: the problem wasn't mine; it was
    Beulah's.  Beulah's previous album, <i>When Your Heartstrings Break</i>, was a
    masterpiece of orchestral 60s-style pop. From start to finish, it was catchy and
    unique, taking the style of 60s pop and turning it into something uniquely its
    own, replete with clever lyrics and impossible-to-shake hooks. On the surface,
    Beulah appears to have successfully replicated this formula. <i>The Coast is
    Never Clear</i> sounds a lot like its predecessor, but it lacks the originality
    and heartfelt delivery that won <i>When Your Heartstrings Break</i> a constant
    presence in so many disc players a couple summers back. Instead, Beulah now
    joins the ranks of bands like Ashley Park, and have been demoted from innovators
    to imitators.</p><p>
    The album's opening chords are lifted almost directly from the Turtles' 1969 hit
    ""You Showed Me."" The songs that follow, ""A Good Man is Easy to Kill"" and ""What
    Will You Do When Your Suntan Fades?,"" incorporate hooks that bear hints of
    resemblance to the Flaming Lips' ""The Spark That Bled"" and Blur's ""Coffee and TV,""
    respectively.</p><p>
    Of course, given the finite number of chord progressions in the world, it's
    inevitable that some musical phrases rear their heads repeatedly. Still, to
    place such familiar themes at the beginning of the album-- and so close to one
    another, at that-- is like McDonald's hanging a picture of a Whopper in its
    window. I'm not accusing Beulah of thievery; they make use of these phrases in
    an original way, building new (and yes, even catchy) songs out of them.  But
    when I hear them I can't help but think of a handful of bands that do this sort
    of thing just as well, if not better.</p><p>
    Still, it's not quite so embarrassing as when the band recycles their own hooks.
    ""Gene Autry"" and ""Silver Lining"" both sound unmistakably like songs from <i>When
    Your Heartstrings Break</i>. Similarly, the lyrics on <i>The Coast is Never Clear</i>
    rarely stray far from the lyrical home built on the previous album-- loneliness,
    the west, and boring parties return as popular topics. But rather than elaborating
    on a theme (as David Byrne has over the course of a million and two songs about
    discomfort with success, or trying to find a home, for example), one gets the
    impression that the band is merely recycling what worked.</p><p>
    This is certainly the case structurally. Most of these songs follow the pattern
    established on <i>Heartstrings</i>. With a few exceptions, they work like normal
    pop songs, but with more parts, often popping up at the bridge, at which point
    the band will present three of four tangential themes before wrapping up with
    another round of verse/chorus. It's a fun take on traditional song structure--
    inventive without ever straying too far from home. Still, two-thirds of the way
    in, the Beulah formula becomes just as tiresome as that of conventional 50s pop
    songs.</p><p>
    That's not to say <i>The Coast is Never Clear</i> is without its moments. ""I
    heard he wrote you a song/ But so what?/ Some guy wrote 69/ And one just ain't
    enough,"" sings Mikes Kurosky on ""Popular Mechanics for Lovers,"" while a
    fingerpicked banjo dances with acoustic guitar on a floor made of strings, horns
    and synth swoops. A few seconds later, all but a few strings and piano drops out,
    and the indie in-jokes give way to Kurosky's reverb-drenched voice singing of
    ""trying all the time to find/ Something that would make you mine/ But all I ever
    find, my love/ Are clichés that don't rhyme.""</p><p>
    ""Gravity's Bringing Us Down"" follows, another strong moment, suggesting the album
    might salvage itself before the end. The band harmonizes, ""We're getting high/
    But we're still feeling down/ Gravity finds a way/ Of pinning us to the ground.""
    The song progresses, switching from part to part in the trademark style described
    above. As the four-minute mark approaches, the bassist picks up a simple yet
    effective riff, injecting energy into the proceedings, and driving the song in a
    new direction. As he repeats himself, the other musicians' parts collapse into a
    cacophony that sounds equal parts Yo La Tengo and Elf Power. From a band so
    reliant on well-structured songs, it's an exciting moment. It's a shame that the
    rest of the album passes without many more of them.</p><p>
<i>When Your Heartstrings Break</i> was a drastic change for Beulah, the addition
    of countless session musicians transforming them from a stripped-down pair of
    Pavement wannabes into 60s-pop-revisionists supreme. Perhaps, <i>The Coast is
    Never Clear</i> could have benefited from another such shift-in-direction. As it
    is, too many of the songs here sound like reheated leftovers from the band's
    previous effort.</p><p>
    On the one hand, I'm relieved. I still have a place in my heart for pop music
    after all. On the other hand, if <i>The Coast is Never Clear</i> is any sign, one
    of pop's most promising groups seems content to merely rest on their laurels.
    Are the songs catchy? Yes. But once they've caught you, they don't take you
    anywhere.</p></div>"|680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/680-the-coast-is-never-clear/|6.6|David M. Pecoraro

In healthy father-son relationships,
    it's usually pretty much true-- from Cal Ripken Jr. following his father onto
    the Orioles, to my dad and I having similar senses of humor.  And so it is with
    Moreno and Caetano Veloso.  Caetano, the elder, is a veritable legend in Brazil,
    one of the most important musical forces in his country for the last 35 years,
    and a master of his art.  And now, up steps his son Moreno to the plate, looking
    ready to take on his father's mantle after only a single album.</p><p>
    
    It's fitting that the opener of Moreno's debut album should be a song co-written
    with his father.  ""Sertao (Outback)"" is a flawlessly beautiful song about the
    peacefulness that music can induce (the lyrics are printed in both Portuguese
    and English, translated by Arto Lindsay), and Moreno handles acoustic guitar and
    cello with equal facility.  What's even more impressive than his playing, though,
    is his voice, which hovers over the entire album like some sort of weightless
    object.  Not only has he inherited his father's gift for effortless melody, but
    his tenor is also imbued with Caetano's sturdy character.  That said, though,
    Moreno doesn't sound exactly like his father and seems to have worked rather
    diligently to develop a style that's uniquely his own.</p><p>
    
    At the other end of the album, ""Sertao"" is complemented by what is possibly the
    prettiest thing I've heard all year: a simple, straight-forward cover of the
    Morey/Churchill song, ""I'm Wishing,"" originally featured in Disney's 1937 release
    of <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>.  The arrangement is extremely
    simple-- only Moreno's voice, backed the sparse piano playing of another son of
    a Brazilian legend, Daniel Jobim.  The lyrics alternate between the original
    English and Portuguese translations, and the music is played out of time,
    drawing out some phrases and shortening others for maximum impact.  Stripped of
    its original maudlin arrangement and pretense, it's an incredibly moving song,
    closing the album on an unself-consciously pretty note.</p><p>
    
    Between those two songs, Moreno and his collaborators (the +2 after his name
    are two extremely talented guys listed only as Domenico and Kassin) pull out
    basically every stop, combining traditional Brazilian sounds with everything
    from buzzing synth bass to theremins swarming around the edges of ""Das Partes
    (of Parts).""  If the bookends of <i>Music Typewriter</i> are designed to move
    your heart, then much of what lies in between is meant to move the rest of you.</p><p>
    
    For proof, look no further than ""Arrivederci,"" with its buoyant rhythms, scratchy
    guitar and ridiculously funky bass parts.  If your head isn't bobbing by the time
    you hit the first shout chorus, you must be dead.  It's also one of a few songs
    where Moreno pulls out his trumpet, yet another instrument he seems born to play.
    ""Enquanto Isso (Meanwhile)"" busts out another funky groove, combining programmed
    drums with Domenico's able kit playing, and layering tumbling Portuguese guitars
    on top.  Kassin's bass duels with the synth while Moreno's vocals soar several
    thousand feet above.</p><p>
    
    One of the less noticeable differences between Moreno and his father (to English
    speakers, anyway) is that Moreno's lyrics rarely enter political territory the
    way Caetano's so often do.  Whereas Caetano's latest album, <i>Noites do Norte</i>,
    focuses fully half of its songs on Brazil's legacy of slavery, <i>Music
    Typewriter</i>'s lyrics remain fully content to dwell on more personal issues.
    Moreno's particularly adept at filling his songs with intense visual imagery and
    thoughtful discourse on the tried-and-true subject of love.</p><p>
    
    At 28 years of age, and with only one album under his belt, it's hard to say
    whether or not Moreno Veloso's career will ever reach the breadth or importance
    of his father's, but it seems unfair to judge him on that now.  Instead, I'm
    willing to take <i>Music Typewriter</i> for what it is: an excellent and very
    promising debut from a young artist who seems destined for great things.</p></div>"|8431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8431-music-typewriter/|8.4|Joe Tangari

It's got the most amazing combination of beaches, modernist
    architecture, grand boulevards, and rich nightlife one could ever imagine. That
    anyone would choose to live anywhere else is phenomenal to me. Why am I not in
    Barcelona? Maybe it's because they speak a funny language-- not Spanish, but
    Catalan, where they use x's in place of ch's. All those years of high school
    spent learning Spanish and all I can say is, ""No tengo una cabeza,"" like the
    crazy man who wanders my street at night.</p><p>
    
    This is one probable reason the Gallygows sing in English. No, they're not crazy.
    They're from Barcelona, which you would never suspect, what with their hapless
    adoration for American and English pop.  This is evidenced by their most amusing
    song on their debut album, ""Live at Budokan,"" which, in addition to making pointed
    reference to Cheap Trick, also contains the lyrics, ""Show you how here comes the
    sun/ I wanna play that song like John/ I can't help it.""  Plus, the song is pure
    indie pop, rather than more derivative Kindercore drivel.</p><p>
    
    Swinging melodies and condensed moments of dissonance resolving over strong
    basslines are the ingredients of the Gallygows' better songs.  The opening track
    on <i>Give It to Her</i>, ""Tone Generator,"" employs these to the Nth while
    crafting perhaps the most amusing word-play on the album (""She was a queen in
    MIDI land doing hot top stereo pan/ He was a wide-band VCO but the lady wanted
    more/ Phase in, phase out/ What about being my tone generator?"").</p><p>
    
    The Lennon kicks in much later, on ""My Citizen,"" when a monster buzz saws into
    a piano/acoustic thing lifted straight off ""A Day in the Life."" What makes it
    theirs is a weird, slipping melody, double-tracked in such a way that it can
    only be called Phil Collins-esque. It's <i>that</i> righteous, even with tucked
    away female back-ups.</p><p>
    
    But on the next track, ""Wait,"" the horrific mid-temponess of the album starts
    setting in.  Those sparse kicks, the strumming, and the Hammond lock groove, and
    suddenly the lack of inflection in the otherwise shiny pop vocals becomes
    irritating.  ""Goalkeeper,"" which helps polish off the album, gets downright
    wedding-jam with heavy employment of a technique called ""the walking bassline,""
    which can also be called the cheapest, most lackluster way to accompany chord
    changes in the Western world.  Its final blow-out is what I, as a smug American,
    can call ""incredibly annoying Euro-noodling,"" which, unlike American noodling
    (Tortoise), employs cheesy synths, drum machines and vocals a la ""Video Killed
    the Radio Star."" ""Roller Disco Combo"" is a late-night, pot-smoking studio goof-off,
    placed as the final track to ensure that listeners understand it isn't their
    ""serious"" song. It's like Ladytron without the icy pretension.</p><p>
    
    ""Confusing"" is the Gallygows position in the indie pop continuum. A third of
    <i>Give It to Her</i> is straightforward, Juliana Hatfield-style pop, another
    third bathes in Beatles, and the other third consists of Aislers Set-like
    modernism. What Gallygows lack is the full consciousness of their pop potential
    or the critical distance to cut away the dead weight. And with the Posies'
    Jon Auer helping craft their more ""pop"" moments, they best take the singles and
    run from their soft rock tendencies.</p></div>"|3386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3386-give-it-to-her/|7.0|Daphne Carr
