No deductions for derivativeness, though-- it's not as if those bands invented cascades of spindly guitar and world-weary dread. After being active in Baltimore but nationally latent for some time, Wilderness made a name for themselves last year with their dreamy debut album and tight, minimally dramatic live performances. You really haven't lived until a man in a domino mask has rubbed a microphone on your nipple while menacingly deep waves of stately post-punk crest and crash behind him.</p><p> 
    
    Like its predecessor, <em>Vessel States</em> is at once lush and brittle; James Johnson's weirdly hearty geriatric wheeze (kind of sounds like Walter Matthau being asphyxiated) gutters and flares on a pyre of wiry guitars and booming, atmospheric percussion. <em>States</em> is even more reticent than the self-titled debut-- measured and serene, almost lackadaisical in its unhurried progression, its esoteric screeds against the late-capitalist regime mete out their frissons like time-released capsules. As a result, the album is less immediately memorable than Wilderness' prior work, but its glittering suspension of pensive melodies and resounding rhythms is just as fine in the long run.</p><p> 
    
    Like most songs on the album, ""The Blood Is on the Wall"" is imposingly stark, moving at a measured and deliberate crawl. Against a weightless wash of cymbals, the guitar picks out a sinuous melody as Johnson strategically unleashes his phlegmatic howl. There's a caesura at the three minute mark, then the drums drop into place and the guitar straightens out into a rigid lockstep. The shift isn't overly pronounced and shouldn't scan as so cathartic, but in the context of Wilderness's economical idiom, it's practically explosive. ""Beautiful Alarms"" is an early standout, with its silvery tracers of guitar and fat, descending bass line; it's an exercise in effervescent stasis until it rides out on a series of tiny decrescendos. And ""Fever Pitch"" recalls the terse, low-lying slither of Polvo, its serpentine melody sidewinding through clouds of understated dissonance.</p><p> 
    
    Lyrically, Johnson is a grave as ever, repetitively reeling off solemn almost-non-sequiturs about ""immortal amortality"" and the ""death verses"" that equal ""entertainment."" You generally can't make him out without the lyric sheet anyway. I think I liked ""Beautiful Alarms"" a little better when I thought it was a post-punk poisoned valentine. ""Those beautiful alarms/ Historical coincidence/ As history disappears"" is slightly less endearing than ""Most beautiful eyes"", which is what it sounded like to me. But Wilderness isn't a band that's out to please; they minimize or omit the musical cues that tell the listener how they should feel at any given point in a song. Like the literal wilderness, Wilderness is utterly indifferent and has the potential to bore people craving more ostentatious entertainment, but rewards patient observation. </p></div>"|8790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8790-vessel-states/|7.5|Brian Howe

Their first full-length, <em>That's Your Fire</em>, hurtled along with no breaks or brakes as the band bled one kind of happiness into another: ""I'm in love! I got the car to start! I'm going to Mars! There's another Snapple in the fridge!"" They had sad songs too, but the poignancy hit and passed. ""Someone pumps my heart until it bursts. This vessel is blown."" Think that sounds sissy? Not against that rhythm section, it doesn't.</p><p>
     
    But after two LPs, the band broke up and then reformed-- this time with keys and percussion man T. J. Lipple replacing vibraphonist Eric Koltnow. This took an adjustment for the band and the fans, but with the gorgeous <em>Here Comes Everyone</em> and now <em>Some Echoes</em>, the transition's complete: The band sounds more confident than ever, and every arrangement is stripped to the bones. After contributing so much of the dreamy grace of <em>Here Comes Everyone</em>, Lipple is a subtle presence here, and Matthew Gengler, a melodic bass guitarist hanging off the same musical tree as Chris Squire, bangs out single-note lines like his fucking life depends on it. Cavallario spends more time behind an electric organ than guitar, and instead of drowning his vocals in the mix, he sticks them right up front where they belong. He'll let an entire ballad hang on his vocals; skip to ""If I Lie Down"", Aloha's own ""Whiter Shade of Pale"", where he sounds bravely fragile above the organ, and only a stray ""will I?"" in the chorus mars the most exquisite song in their catalog.</p><p>
     
    The psychedelic rock of cuts like the opener, ""Brace Your Face"", bring a 1960s Strawberry Alarm Clock/early Yes vibe, and the lyrics are pared down to a few beautiful but head-scratching images per song. As far as I can tell, Cavallario's singing about the pain of staying separated from his lover, as memories and doubt play tricks with his head, until their explosive reunion at the end of the record. That, or he's been abducted by aliens. I'm fine either way, because while <em>Some Echoes</em> starts out as a good album, by the end it reveals itself as the best thing they've ever done: the second half is astonishing, from the hackey sack guitars of the Sea and the Cake-esque ""Weekend"" to ""Mountain"", a shattering final anthem. </p><p>
     
    And none of it would work if they still had the vibes. While Aloha Mk 2 proved itself as a going concern on <em>Here Comes Everyone</em>, <em>Some Echoes</em> explains why they had to drop the freewheeling improv that defined them early on. The vibes splayed across <em>That's Your Fire</em> like wild, loose nerve endings, all but stealing the spotlight from Cavallario's vocals-- which may have been what he wanted, back then. But now his band has a clearer, purer vision, and they express it fiercely.</p></div>"|130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/130-some-echoes/|8.0|Chris Dahlen

    drumbeats that propel the shadowy pop of Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and guitarist
    Zachary Lehrhoff for the stingingly sweet melodies of noise duo Ex-Models,
    both insist that the Seconds is not simply a side project-- and both would like
    to devote more energy to it. Equally short on downtime, engineering
    student Jeannie Kwon joins the New York based group on bass and vocals,
    providing a deep kick to the astringent, urgent tones of the no wave
    trio's second full length, <i>Kratitude.</i></p><p>
    
    Chase's distinctive drumming style is often labeled as primitive,
    but he has considerable flair for weaving unpredictable
    rhythms on a simple kit and an intuitive relationship to the electric
    guitar. Short on fills and strong on the kick and tom, Chase works
    best with rhythm heavy guitarists, with whom he spars and interlocks with
    typically brutal, knotty grace. Like Chase's YYYs band mate Nick Zinner,
    Lehrhoff extends his guitar lines from the gluey pull of the drums
    while simultaneously communicating with the beat, which is far more
    effective than focusing on embellishment. The same can be said for the
    vocals, which the Seconds mine for phonetic, textural, and rhythmic
    qualities rather than the meaning or metaphor behind the lyric. On
    ""Dogsicle"", for example, Kwon and Lehrhoff repeat an indecipherable line
    that blurs together into a swirling, kinetic pattern and, with the force
    of a fierce whirlpool, is eventually pulled down into a cacophony of
    barked tantrums, lean beats, and sliced distortion.</p><p>
    
    Largely conceived by Chase, and in keeping with his minimalist style,
    <i>Kratitude was recorded on a 4-track at his old practice space in Brooklyn.
    It's less catchy than 2001's ""Y"", yet more immediate and hyperactive.
    Melody and structure are like an afterthought in this brisk collection of
    violently impulsive, jutting punk rock songs; instead the Seconds head
    directly for the jugular of rhythm and repetition. On the album's opening
    track, ""Moving"", Kwon's dampened harmonic string textures burst into a raw
    flow of post-hardcore that echoes L.A. noiseniks the Mae Shi or, as the
    marketing sticker on the jewel case accurately suggests, Throbbing
    Gristle.</i></p><p>
    
    Though the Seconds lament the lack of time they can devote to
    fuelling their glorious racket, the sense of urgency that arises out this
    situation strongly contributes to the group's sound. It is reactionary and
    explorative and awkward. Not unconsidered, just direct-- and overflowing
    with sounds that itch and split, like hundreds of nails bouncing over
    sheets of broken glass.</p></div>"|7853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7853-kratitude/|7.0|Mia Lily Clarke

But as evidenced by their recent collaboration with Iron &amp; Wine, and now by <i>Garden Ruin</i>, their fifth proper full-length (not counting collections like <i>Aerocalexico</i> or <i>The Book and the Canal</i>), they're more interested these days in pushing their boundaries and building on strengths.  <i>Garden Ruin</i> is the most straightforward ""rock"" record they've made, and the differences between it and their previous releases are immediately discernable.</p><p>
    
    I won't lie. I already miss Calexico's old mariach-indie rock sound and the rampant eclecticism that saw them jumping from jazz to flamenco dub to folk to icy dirges on 2003's <em>Feast of Wire</em>, but fortunately, the sounds that replace those bygone elements are just as satisfying.  <em>Garden Ruin</em> is beautifully fleshed out and focused, retaining some of the duo's Southwestern elements but shifting the horn sound from Ciudad Juarez to Los Angeles.  Here, Calexico economically blend jazz, country, American folk, and indie rock into concise, well-oiled pop songs, complete with gorgeous vocal layering that's popped up before in a more primitive state on tracks like ""Not Even Stevie Nicks..."" and ""Grip-Tape"", but is now fully formed.</p><p>
    
    The stylistic change is evident from the album's opening notes, where an acoustic guitar figure that once might have fluttered through Spanish passages becomes a minor-key riff instead, sending the song speeding off on a brisk drumbeat as Joey Burns belts out twangy vocals.  The meticulously detailed mix reveals interlocking acoustic and electric guitars, piano, glockenspiel, strings, and horns, before finally ending with Burns' layered falsetto wordlessly harmonizing with itself.</p><p>
    
    The high harmonies on the verses of ""Panic Open String"" are absolutely beautiful, the mellifluous melodies and flowing steel guitar contrasting sharply with the much harder start/stop of the chorus.  But Burns one-ups himself a few songs later, piling harmonies on ""Lucky Dime"" over Convertino's spryly shuffling drums to create a Technicolor pop nugget.  ""Roka (Danza de la Muerte)"" finds that spooky corner Calexico have so often inhabited, with starlit acoustic guitar and arresting Spanish guest vocals.  Its lyrics also offer pointed commentary on immigration, a rarity for this album, where the band's usual fixation on the politics of the border is largely supplanted by the politics of the heart: ""So close your eyes/ Slow your breath/ Dream of northern lights/ Around this dance of death.""</p><p>
    
    By contrast, closer ""All Systems Red"" is epic.  The song begins as a quiet acoustic tune, but morphs into a lurching monster as dramatic as anything the band has done to this point, guitars straining skyward, even as the chord progression descends and a maelstrom of noise reaches in to pull them down.  Burns belts out from the middle of it with a power he's never
    harnessed before, and when it finally reaches the point of total overload, the rhythms give way to a gradual decay.  It's a hell of an ending to a heck of a record, a display of sound and fury at which the duo has rarely even hinted.  I'd never wanted Calexico to change, but the new direction suits them well, proving that even in the face of radical metamorphosis, they remain as stunning and distinctive as ever.</p></div>"|1234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1234-garden-ruin/|8.1|Joe Tangari

With her haunted, theatrical delivery, Foster cuts an arresting figure-- whether through the rustic balladry of her duo Born Heller, the snaky acid rock of 2004's <em>All the Leaves Are Gone, or the avant-folk of 2005's </em><em>Hazel Eyes, I Will Lead You</em>. But with her latest solo work, <i>A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, Foster has found perhaps the most appropriate vehicle yet for her singular and affecting talents-- 19th century German art-songs, wholly reconstructed here via Foster's skeletal arrangements of voice and guitar. </i></p><p>
    Written in a form known as ""Kunstlied"" or simply ""Lieder,"" the songs on <i>A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing were composed by such Romantic Era greats as Johannes Brahms and Franz Schubert, with lyrics based upon the texts of writers like Johann Goethe or Eduard Mörike. Though poetic by design, it was also not uncommon for Lieder lyrics to feature a brief, fable-like narrative, giving many of these songs the appearance of a traditional ballad or folktale. Needless to say, the dramatic range and construction of these pieces nicely dovetails with Foster's idiosyncratic vocal swoops and warbles, and regardless of any language barriers she sounds perfectly at home in this gothic, Old World environment, as well as with the guttural patterns of German speech.</i></p><p>
    The album opens, aptly enough, with a version of Schubert's ""An Die Musik"", a short, rapturous ode to music with lyrics by Franz Schober. All is quiet on this track, with Josephine's multi-tracked vocals harmonizing over acoustic guitar, until suddenly guitarist Brian Goodman (of Foster's psych-rock group the Supposed) rips into a knobby and splintered electric solo that seems transmitted from another century entirely. And though some listeners might find Goodman's forceful presence on this and other tracks to be intrusive, his work provides a crucial streak of impulsive expression that keeps the album from seeming an overly reverent exercise in front-parlor nostalgia.</p><p> 
    This sense of spontaneous creation is maintained on the following ""Der König in Thule"", which spirals into a glorious eddy of a cappella overdubbed vocals. On ""Die Schewestern"", a Brahms composition that relates a tale of romantic jealousy between two sisters, Foster's vocal is effectively dual-channeled to better approximate the song's twin narrators, while on Schumann's ""Wehmut"" she sounds as distantly lonesome as the lyrics' yearning nightingale.</p><p>
<em>A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</em> reaches its experimental apex on Foster's epic-length treatment of ""Auf einer Burg"", a Schumann piece whose lyrics portray a rather turgid storyline complete with a decayed castle and weeping bride. Here her voice takes on a dissolute, glassy luster while ghostly shreds of guitar and feedback crumble into the shadows. The creepy, unsettling theater of this performance is further enhanced by an immediate segue into the album-closing ""Näne des Geliebten"", a lovely slice of sunlit folk that breezily recalls the traditional work of Shirley Collins. On these pieces and throughout the album, Foster displays her unique ability to fully inhabit the space of a song- no matter how outlandish or anachronistic its details may seem. In so doing she is able to recast these ageless works in her own solitary image, an image that seems more acutely defined the further backwards she casts her gaze. </p></div>"|3325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3325-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

Don't tell that to Pretty Girls Make Graves-- they know it. For four years the band has made music in a style that's widely warned against. But what many have read as shallow, angsty discharge actually bespeaks an unusual maturity as Pretty Girls Make Graves throw caution to the wind and do as they please-- an insouciance that has translated well into their music.</p><p>
    I guess it's no surprise, then, that the same musicians who OK'd the lines ""Do you remember what the music meant?"" and ""Do you remember when the music meant something?"" on back-to-back albums would eventually grow self-conscious and give into pressure to expand their horizons. For that I'll begrudge <em>Élan Vital</em>'s growing pains. The band's first record in three years is also its first with keyboardist Leona Marrs, and the album packages a loosened-up (read: defanged), groove-centric sound, infinitely more urbane but so much more boring, too. Forced change always comes off rushed and awkward and overzealous; no exception here, from half-timed should-be banger ""The Magic Hour"" to post-Decemberists accordion-whacked ""Selling the Wind"".</p><p> 
    Opener ""The Nocturnal House"" makes a weak but sadly appropriate opening statement. On previous records, this band sounded Xacto knife sharp; not only were their chops speed metal-worthy, the recordings pulled each note taut so the chops actually did chop. <em>Élan Vital</em> is a looser, sloppier affair, soft-angled where <em>The New Romance</em> was acute-as-fuck, humid and thick where the old stuff was icy-clean. ""The Nocturnal House"" abuses drummer Nick DeWitt's talents, overdoing the kicks and generally running him silly on the odd-meter hamster wheel. Singer Andrea Zollo's vocals come in massive, echoing tides, which waterlog the track where it needs precision. Better is ""Parade"", which is franker about its rhythm and takes care not to overflavor the sauce, a smooth velouté of bass, honeyed keyboards, and tastefully double-tracked drums. It's the best rock samba since Deerhoof's ""Spirit Ditties of No Tone"".</p><p> 
    ""Domino"" sidles up to the edge of the prom dancefloor doing its sultriest neo-disco two-step. It's hard to front on the two-finger piano bass line and vocal-mirroring organ gestures, but peals of overdriven guitars sully the swagger. Such is it with much of <em>Élan Vital</em>. Parts that might otherwise dash or dance or do pole vaults instead feel haggard or encumbered by reverb and other treatments. There's obviously a desire to take a risk here, flee the comfort zone, which is admirable, and expected-- bands always get stir crazy before their listeners do. But the more complicated this album grows, the more I miss erstwhile PGMG's beeline energy, which Phil Ek's crisp production helped to further galvanize. ""Speakers Push the Air"", with its loping synth undercarriage and synced-up guitar bends, was sophisticated enough; ""All Medicated Geniuses"" turned polyrhythmic tailwhips without sacrificing anthem. <em>Élan Vital</em> finds the band turning up rocks for a new voice when all it really needs to do is chase its own tail.</p></div>"|6466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6466-elan-vital/|6.4|Sam Ubl

    Parts &amp; Labor aren't noise in the same way Wolf Eyes or the Dead C are, but
    noise isn't merely a bay leaf seasoning their stylistic soup-- it's more
    like the broth. Their songs float in a bowl of buzz and squelch, with nearly
    every sound outside of the cymbals and most of the vocals pushed well into
    the red. Playing the band's second album, <em>Stay Afraid</em>, too loudly on
    headphones is begging for tinnitus, as the whole treble range is throbbing
    with cutting, ragged overtones and distortion. It's more
    aggressive than their previous work, including their split with Tyondai
    Braxton, and to call it unrelenting would be an understatement.</p><p>
    
    The vocals, split between keyboardist/guitarist Dan Friel and
    bassist/keyboardist BJ Warshaw, are the kind of everyman deal you get when
    a band opts against bringing in another member just to sing-- plenty
    palatable but not distinctive, and anyway they're jostling for space with a
    wall of squeeling electronics and searing guitars that offer no quarter.
    Still, the presence of those vocals amongst the music's marauding
    elements injects a palpable emotional component-- especially on ""Repair"" and ""A
    Great Divide"", where the vocals, simple as they are, help the songs to transcend
    the oversaturation and really take flight.</p><p>
    
    On the title track, Friel's voice holds off a
    tide of shrieking feedback as long as it can, finally succumbing to the
    monstrous coda, where drummer Christopher Weingarten totally loses his shit,
    providing as much nasty noise as he does basic rhythm. One aspect of the band's music that's unfortunately largely absent here is the vaguely Celtic angle they've
    flirted with, wherein the guitar or keys take on a drone/melody motif
    similar to bagpipes, but they've certainly found plenty of other sounds to fill the space.</p><p>
    
    What Parts &amp; Labor have figured out how to do, in a way no one else really
    has, is to make noise anthemic. As such, <em>Stay Afraid</em> is accessible though still not for the faint
    of heart-- if you like your melodies sweet and your lyrics decipherable
    without the booklet, stay away. But for the growing hordes of noise fans, this record not only delivers but could serve as a gateway to more abrasive sounds.</p></div>"|6533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6533-stay-afraid/|7.7|Joe Tangari

He was already a curiosity, a white rapper with rural working-class roots, and he'd played his background for laughs on ""Ugly"", his breakthrough single, a couple of years earlier. But on <em>Deliverance</em>, he dug deeper, talking about poverty and marginalization with surprising candor while producer Timbaland spliced his usual futuristic thump with country samples and jug-band harmonicas. It was a bold and unprecedented move, and it predicted the rap-collabo feud that hit country a year later with Nelly and Tim McGraw's ""Over &amp; Over"" and Cowboy Troy. Nobody noticed, of course. </i><i>Deliverance sold far too few copies, and it remains one of the decade's great unheard albums.</i></p><p>
    
    Follow-up <i>The Charm is Sparxxx's attempt to jump back into the mainstream after he tried and failed to change the way pop music sounds. The album-- the Georgia emcee's first since moving from Timbaland's Beat Club label to Purple Ribbon, the new imprint run by Big Boi of OutKast-- arrives in the shadow of ""Ms. New Booty"", the witless bass-and-sirens club-jam collaboration with the Ying Yang Twins, who, I swear to God, get dumber every time they open their mouths (""Sippin' on Patron, blong blong blong/ Shorty in a thong, whoa whoa whoa""). ""Ms. New Booty"" is depressingly boring, but it's done its job, giving Bubba his biggest-ever hit. And thankfully, it's an anomaly on <em>The Charm</em>, which is surprisingly great as conciliatory moves go. </i></p><p>
    
    At less than an hour, <em>The Charm</em> is short and slight for a mainstream rap album, and it has none of the genre-fucking courage of <i>Deliverance. Big Boi doesn't rap on the album, and he only produces one song (the watery, diffuse almost-jazz of ""Ain't Life Grand""), but the influence of Atlanta's Dungeon Family crew, of which Sparxxx and Outkast are included, is all over the album. The production, mostly from members of the DF-affiliated Organized Noize crew, is all happy, propulsive bounce: eerily spare whistles on ""Claremont Lounge"", gorgeous flecks of acoustic guitar and burbling bass on ""As the Rim Spins"", a chopped-up children's choir on the almost absurdly sunny ""Wonderful"". And Bubba has fully internalized the crew's mixed-up cocktail of swagger and introspection; even when he's boasting, he's both self-effacing and defensive. ""If I ain't on ya list, shit, you can't win 'em all/ But until he died, most of y'all ain't fuck with Biggie Smalls,"" he says on the album-opener ""Represent"". Later, on ""That Man"": ""Really don't expect no forgiveness for <em>Deliverance</em>/ Then again, I offer no apologies; I lived the shit."" Conveying this stuff in an unpretentious aw-shucks drawl, he drips with charm but is likeably clumsy enough that it's almost shocking when he busts out an excellent double-time flow on ""The Otherside"".</i></p><p>
    
    That modesty also comes through on his goofy pickup lines (on ""Wonderful"": ""Sit on my lap and let's talk about the first thing that pop up""). So it's an unpleasant surprise to hear an ugly new streak of misogyny on a couple of songs. He makes up for it on ""Run Away"", a sweet, tender story-song, rapping about two kids who leave home together on a bus over plaintive acoustic guitars and an understated drum track. Bubba wants to become a pop star, and he probably won't succeed, but he hasn't lost his heart.</p></div>"|7852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7852-the-charm/|7.7|Tom Breihan

Forget simple terms like rock, punk, or hardcore; we've already soared past to post-rock, post-punk, and what seems like a never-ending list of ""-cores.""</p><p>
    
    Athens, Georgia's Cinemechanica are a product of this sort of puzzling problem. As I listen to the nine tracks on their debut full length, <em>The Martial Arts</em>, reference points flash from all over the place. If Don Caballero is post-rock, then Cinemechanica is as well. Two back-to-back instrumental tracks in the middle of this album are fine examples. ""Take Me to the Hospital"" builds a foundation of brooding bass lines, and then layers guitars over the top that range from fluid leads to walls of chaotic chords. ""Get Outta Here Hitler"" explodes with rapid-fire snare fills and squealing guitars, and later intensifies things with distorted bass and frenetic rhythms.</p><p>
    
    But then again, if Drive Like Jehu is post-punk, and if Q and not U and Faraquet are post-hardcore, then go ahead and attach those labels to Cinemechanica also. On ""I'm Tired of Paul McCartney"" the band recalls those styles by mixing screamed vocals and dense chords with almost-melodic finger-tapped guitar noodling. Cinemechanica make it clear early in the track that they have little interest in the traditional verse-chorus-verse song structure. In ""Ruins of Karnac"", guitars alternate throughout the verses, creating their own complex syncopated rhythm that's accentuated by their being hard panned to opposite speakers. </p><p>
    
    Along with Joel Hatstat's bass, drummer Mike Albanese's frantic beats create a powerful rhythm section that, despite being in constant motion, leaves room for Andy Pruett and Bryant Williamson to interweave their dizzying guitar lines in the foreground. All four shine on ""Brain Tarp"", where Albanese's drumming drives jazzy guitars into something much more chaotic. Hell, if not for the straightforward instrumentation and the brevity of the songs-- the average length is about three minutes-- even prog-rock could be a descriptor. But really, genre labels rarely aptly describe the bands they're attached to, and they certainly do little to explain the spastic, razor-sharp music on <em>The Martial Arts</em>. </p></div>"|1835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1835-the-martial-arts/|7.5|Cory D.

    by Detroit kid Jimmy Edgar brings to mind the late 1990s, when
    Timbaland's nimble electronic production style emerged and
    a few people commented that he was making tracks far more
    ""intelligent"" and ""danceable"" than anything coming out of proper IDM.
    Hip-hop production turned a corner around that time, and all of a
    sudden ideas incubated in British and European dance music scenes were
    fair game. With its catchy descending keyboard line pulled from jazz
    fusion, chop-shop vocals that zip by like a flipbook animation, and
    drums that keep tumbling over themselves as they move relentlessly
    forward, ""Pret'a'porter"" jumps back and forth over the past decade to
    give a different spin on the virtuosic programming once synonymous
    with Warp.</p><p>
    
    The production is generally contemporary, but you can't be a dude in
    your early twenties making electronic music in Detroit and not spend time
    looking back. Edgar seems comfortable with earlier styles, picking and
    choosing the bits that mesh easily with his more post-rave sound.
    ""Personal Information"", for example, with its three poppy chords and
    ridged groove, is pure and effective breakdance electro. Vocals are a
    regular presence, and Edgar uses flat, robotic processing in a manner
    suggestive of Juan Atkins circa Cybotron's ""Clear"", where the words
    are sound first, an outlet for nugget-sized slogans second, and never
    aspire to be elements of pop song. Some are so silly they distract
    from the musical pleasure (""I Wanna Be Your STD""-- yuck) but for the
    most part they stay a layer back from the main action, as designed.</p><p>
    
    The spoken bits in one of the record's best tracks, the
    Drexciya-influenced ""Jefferson Interception"", reinforce the song's
    aged feel and sense of an alternative history; the clean efficiency of
    the electronics seem to portray a bygone vision of the future in which
    Detroit might have been central. (Jefferson Avenue is a primary
    thoroughfare in the city, spanning grinding inner-city poverty to the
    vast wealth of the suburbs.) You can almost see the packed assembly
    lines endlessly turning out products for which one assumes there would
    be a market. Techno is ideally suited to such melancholy imagery,
    something Edgar seems to understand.</p><p>
    
    In spots Edgar gets more abstract, as on the middling drone/drift
    track ""Telautraux"", but generally he's too enamored with futurist
    techno's percussive vision to stay there long. By any measure <em>Color
    Strip</em> is a strong debut. There is no new ground being broken but
    that's not the point; Edgar comes across as a committed student,
    absorbing twenty-five years of electronic music and figuring out how
    to integrate and mold the history into something that sits comfortably
    in the now. From the evidence here he is well on his way.</p></div>"|2940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2940-color-strip/|7.2|Mark Richardson

We hate it when our friends become successful. That's Mike Skinner's built-in defense against anyone who doesn't receive this, his third full-length record, with the same unquestioning enthusiasm that greeted 2002's <em>Original Pirate Material</em> and 2004's <em>A Grand Don't Come for Free</em>. With the benefit of hindsight, those records feel markedly more different from each other than they did originally: the former a blunted jubilee of skits, stoned tangents, unrumpled beatmaking, and catalogued moodswings that was elegantly and instructively produced-- practically the chav <em>Parklife</em>; the latter a much darker record with braver production choices, denser verbiage, and a central narrative that only worked because Skinner had the charisma to see it through.</p><p>
    
    It is Skinner's ability to exponentially increase the on-paper value of an ordinary idea by garnishing it with the right details that is his main strength and the core component of what he does. That's why, despite the fact that the <em>The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living</em> is devoted to one of the most tedious and overdone conceits in autobiographical storytelling-- that of fame and its attendent trappings-- most of us went into this third outing with good reason for hope, or at the least, cautious optimism.</p><p>
    
    So yeah, this is his blow-up record, the first music he's made knowing he's a truly bankable commodity, but instead of the celebratory club tracks to which he's entitled, we're tasked to sort through the dark insides of Skinner's post-fame headspace, which is fluctuating almost exclusively between yammering neuroses and smug self-aggrandizement. This is, by some distance, his most interior record. Where the first two found him clambering for closer contact with the people around him, <em>The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living</em> takes place almost entirely in his own head, where's he either engaged in a struggle to stay on the right side of sanity (and possibly sobriety) or to keep his misanthropy contained. </p><p>
    
    In the case of the latter, he is largely unsuccessful-- one of the most unlikable and disappointing things about Skinner Mk 2006 is that he seems to regard nearly everyone in the ouside world as either his prey or his inferior. ""War of the Sexes"" has Skinner-- a man who once agonized over a hair twirl for a whole song-- sermonizing on the fine art of sarging a ""hostile lamb"" before unfunnily concluding with a reminder not to get too drunk, because ""people who get hammered don't get to nail."" In ""Can't Con an Honest John"", he smarmily reprises a classic grift: ""Using this technique/ You're going to take all this man's money/ But you're not going to care/ Cause he's going to fucking deserve it."" And over the farting keys of ""Memento Mori"", perhaps the smuggest and laziest thing he's ever released, Skinner flaunts his ignorance with a flip of the billfold: ""Memento Mori, Memento Mori/ It's Latin and it says we must all die/ But I tried it for a while and it's a load of boring shite/ So I buy buy buy/ Bye bye.""</p><p>
    
    Worse yet, the album's requisite feelgooders-- the sappy paean to fidelity, ""All Goes Out the Window"", and the strangely unmoving blues-gospel tribute to his deceased father, ""Never Went to Church""-- register as lyrically barren and a little strained. In all these moments, he seems both alienated and alienating, miles removed from his former warmth. Even his jokes are uncharacteristically spotty; a few punchlines are so leaden you feel like you're being shouted into a corner by someone who's had about six lines too many.</p><p>
    
    But here's the rub. Not only are there scattered moments of lyrical brilliance on <em>The Hardest Way</em>, but from a producerly standpoint, it's probably Skinner's most accomplished and interesting record yet. Opener ""Pranging Out"" is a highlight in both columns-- over a punchy, full-bodied, and garage-touched beat, Skinner details with brutal candor the downswing of a particularly ugly drug binge: ""Carelessly racking out prang just to handle the fear/ I do a line but then panic and feel a bit prangy/ So I glug Marlon from the bottle to ease off the panic/ Then when it starts wearing off I just feel a bit sad."" On the baroque title track, Skinner outlines the machinations of the business side of stardom to dizzying effect; misunderstood lead single ""When You Wasn't Famous"" marries a spell of Page Six-rumormongering with a mesmerizing marching beat that crumbles and woozes with a virtuoso touch; and the genuinely funny ""Two Nations"" offers up a cockeyed chord progression and a tongue-in-cheek riposte to Brit-baiting Americans: ""Two nations divided by common language/ And about two hundred years of new songs and dances/ But the differences in language are just the bits you got wrong/ Cause we were the ones who invented the language.""</p><p>
    
    The album's frustrating push/pull is neatly articulated with the closing track, ""Fake Streets Hats"", which intersperses a few choice tour anecdotes with actual recording snippets of backstage exchanges. It's a tantalizing idea executed poorly, and Skinner ultimately ends the track (and hence the album) so abruptly you're left wondering if he doesn't have the odd moment where he regards his audience as potential con victims as well. Yes, there's certainly enough greatness here to preserve the listener's goodwill towards him for another album; the bigger and more interesting question is whether Skinner will be able to reciprocate.</p></div>"|7534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7534-the-hardest-way-to-make-an-easy-living/|7.0|Mark Pytlik

It's a sound that could easily sustain an entire record. While QOTSA's follow-up to <em>Songs</em> was consistent enough, it's becoming more apparent that ringleader Josh Homme is getting some of his best work done away from the weight of expectation, from the Desert Sessions to Eagles of Death Metal, whose first record was much more consistent and satisfying than most had expected. Now, EoDM return with <em>Death by Sexy</em>, further proving that this high-octane novelty has more than just joke appeal, and granting my QOTSA wishes in the process.</p><p>
    Singer Jesse ""The Devil"" Hughes (or Boots Electric, or whatever sassy moniker they've slapped on him today) is the perfect manifestation of QOSTA's lighter side, slipping between a manic Mick Jagger caricature and a Cramps-like amphetamine Elvis. For a record that revels in the clichés of rock, his attempts are terribly cute. Where Queens of the Stone Age have always explored the dark and dirty, the excess and the evil, the nicotine, valium, vicodin, marijuana, and ecstasy, the Eagles of Death Metal crank up a cock-rock sound that's free of any danger or seriousness. This isn't subversion, this is good clean fun.</p><p>
    One would think innocence and cock-rock would be like fire and holy water, or that a record that just skims through familiar modes couldn't sustain itself for an entire album, but here, all bets are off. The cuddlification is kind of the appeal: Despite lyrics like ""I touch you there because I know the spot,"" they rock ""I Gotta Feeling (Just Nineteen)"" with the absurdity it deserves-- sleazy, but in the same way as a Tijuana Bible comic. There are tracks a bit too campy to hold up for repeat listening, like ""Shasta Beast"" or the bizarre swamp lullaby ""The Ballad of Queen Bee and Baby Duck"", but mostly it's the camp that makes it work; they get away with ""I Gotta Feeling"", as well as the pregnant pauses on ""Don't Speak (I Came to Make a Bang!)"", the faux-Delta blues of ""Bag O' Miracles"", and, in ""I Like to Move in the Night"", being the umpteen-millionth band to quote ""Brown Sugar"". EoDM may nearly cross into Ween territory, but rather than roaming all over the stylistic map, they consistently stick to a rubbery ZZ/Stones pastiche.</p><p>
    The other main reason it works: Homme probably doesn't want the puppet master tag, but the drums are perfect. Totally ham-fisted but still incredibly intuitive and propulsive, they're the bedrock of this album's goofy appeal. <i>Death by Sexy</i> rubs out the line between novelty and earnestness, reminding us that music doesn't have to be ironic to have a sense of humor.</p></div>"|2904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2904-death-by-sexy/|7.3|Jason Crock

Her songs show traces of Nellie McKay's subversive formalism, Regina Spektor's bizarro cabaret, and Tori Amos's sweeping scope, but Dienel could be just as easily and fruitfully compared to those outside her camp-- to the Decemberists or Clem Snide or to literary types like George Saunders and Z.Z. Packer, whose short stories share an oddball sensibility and heart-rent humor with Dienel's story songs.</p><p>
    Like most writers, Dienel has her pet topics, first and foremost herself. ""Everything"" is a snappy birth-of the-artist tale (""When I was only four I found my lonely ivories and we became fast friends""), and ""Cabin Fever"" recalls her move from her small, seaside Massachusetts hometown to Boston-- a looming milestone in her young life. ""Tundra"" shouts out to JoAnn Fabrics (an indie first?) and erects a complex metaphor involving the Weather Channel and a broken relationship. The 1960s also feature prominently on <i>Wind-Up Canary, although not in terms of the counterculture so much as the Establishment. Stylistically, she slyly alludes to bossa nova and exotica rhythms without overtly incorporating them, and she deconstructs and rebuilds 60s pop mythology to gee-whiz glee. ""Frankie and Annette"" re-imagines the Mouseketeers as small-time outlaws, pitiable in their poverty, and on the opener, ""Doctor Monroe"", Dienel sings about an Everyman who chain-smokes, reads <em>Playboy</em>, drinks highballs. But soon the façade crumbles, and he begins dressing up in his wife Helen's clothes and ""speaking to the sixth dimensions through public urinals."" Dienel marries this hard-luck tale to her most playful verse melody and her most impassioned chorus, half in awe of the man's <em>savoir faire</em> and half disgusted by his lack of self-examination. It's her best song-- her ""Joan Jett of Arc"", her ""Sea Oak"".</i></p><p>
    As ""Doctor Monroe"" shows-- and ""Tundra"", and ""The Coffee Beanery""-- Dienel's at her best when she's at her weirdest, and oddly she's at her weirdest when she's at her catchiest, because nothing sells a peculiar daydream as persuasively as an infectious hook. Flirting with preciousness but never going all the way, Dienel always sounds confident in her quirkiness, blissfully unaware that her melodies aren't always strong enough to warrant such self-assuredness or that her lyrics sometimes sound like clever nonsense. But who needs melodies when you've got real songs, or sensible lyrics when you've got so much personality?</p></div>"|2641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2641-wind-up-canary/|7.6|Stephen M.

And while for some albums such a quaint and colorful narrative might seem an incidental talking point, in the case of Mi and L'au it becomes an essential descriptive, as it's nearly impossible to imagine this delicate, wintry music being made under any other circumstance.</p><p>
    
    Matching the couple's hushed vocals with acoustic guitars and minimal, deceptively sophisticated arrangements, Mi and L'au create music that bears only tangential relation to traditional folk, seeming instead to be their own enchanted form of stripped-down, hermetic cabaret-pop. Sung entirely in English, their songs do sound considerably less alien and otherworldly than Finnish psych-folk counterparts like Islaja, Lau Nau, or others from the extended Fonal label roster. The album's relative accessibility can perhaps be traced to guest contributions from members of Akron/Family and Antony compatriot Julia Kent which were overdubbed and mixed in Brooklyn. Yet despite these outward flourishes, Mi and L'au carries the distinct air of a work constructed almost entirely in private, seemingly intended for no further audience than the snow-topped fir trees eavesdropping through the windows.</p><p>
    
    Quietly plucked strings, woodwinds, and bells help give the opening processional ""They Marry"" a gently off-kilter carnival sway, with Mi's willowy vocals delivered in an ear-nibbling, Bardot-like whisper. ""Fold your hands around me,"" she repeatedly coos and the music promptly obliges, enveloping her voice in cozy wisps of chimney-smoke. The chiming ""Philosopher"" sounds as though it were composed in accordance with a vintage grandfather clock. Here L'au joins Mi on effortless vocal harmonies before taking the lead himself on the austere ""I've Been Watching You"", a track whose lucid, plain-spoken lyricism fondly recalls Leonard Cohen's <em>Songs From a Room</em>.</p><p> 
    
    Given the inherent, rustic simplicity of the duo's equipment and production (as well as Mi's rather limited vocal range) it is perhaps inevitable that over the course of these 14 songs a certain placid uniformity begins to afflict tracks like the uneventful ""New Born Child"" or the calliope-winding-down ""Merry Go Round"". Much richer and more effective are tracks like ""Older"" or ""A Word in Your Belly"", both of which feature exquisite, understated string arrangements similar to those producer Joe Boyd helped score for performers like Nick Drake or Vashti Bunyan. These orchestrations reach an apex on the set-closing ""Study"", which pairs a diffuse symphonic swell with what sounds like a mad scientist's bubbling test tubes, as Mi softly wonders ""What's to come of tomorrow'"" And as their captivating debut proves the great distances Mi and L'au are willing to go for their music, the possible answers to this album's final question appear to be virtually limitless.</p></div>"|5685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5685-mi-and-lau/|7.3|Matthew Murphy

    handy ""sounds like"" box on an artist's myspace. Wax Tailor, a French 
    musician, composer, and beat conductor in the mold of Rjd2 or Portishead's 
    Geoff Barrow, has a page on which he lists a handful of 
    golden age hip-hop artists, jazz giants, soul singers, and soundtrack 
    innovators as his influences. That's <em>Tales of Forgotten Melodies</em>' gamut. Genre-melding 
    and cinematic is what he'd like us to say. So we'll bite: His album sounds 
    like a movie. An occasionally disjointed movie with clearer intentions than 
    it originally lets on (think <em>Mulholland Falls</em>, not <em>Mulholland 
    Drive</em>), but still a movie.</p><p>
    Wax Tailor samples quite often, from producer standby 
    Galt MacDermot's ""And He Will Not Come Again"" to dialogue from Alfred Hitchcock's 1950s version of <i>The Man Who Knew Too Much and the jumble is easy headphones music. 
    I've accomplished plenty of work listening to it this week. Thing is, it 
    never really finds its footing. Wax appears to be searching for slivers and 
    slices of space, which are chopped into interludes into which he can slide his 
    favorite sounds-- sounds that likely recall important visual moments for 
    him. I love Woody Allen's nebbishy purr as much as the next guy. But it's 
    still a musical crutch on <em>Forgotten Melodies</em>, now being released in 
    the states after success in Europe last year.</i></p><p>
    Many of the songs that fall between these curios are orchestral numbers, 
    some produced live by French cellist Marina Quaisse, and better than 
    average. ""Hypnosis Theme"" features a downtempo lull until Tailor drops an 
    odd rhythm under Quaisse's cello. ""Our Dance"" mystifyingly opens with a 
    sample of Björk's speaking voice, only to disappoint when breathy Charlotte Savary takes over on vocals. ""Walk the Line"", a song about music's 
    impulsive power, swells with violin stabs and lugubrious trumpets. The 
    Others, a North Carolina rap trio, are featured on the track and acquit themselves 
    reasonably well, though they seem intent on dropping ""Wax Tailor"" into every 
    verse, a strange tic. ""How I Feel"" straight-up jacks the vocals from Nina 
    Simone's ever-arresting ""Feelin' Good"" and laces them over the softest, most 
    amateur beat on the album, a sleepy collection of delicate pangs and brass. 
    It's the truest indictment of this album's flaws.</p><p>
    Wax Tailor is a beat star in his native France and his earnest (if mediocre, 
    idea-wise) album fits snugly into his country's history of lazily gorgeous 
    pop notables. Though one suspects the scads of American dialogue and 
    EPMD-sampling have him yearning for something a bit closer to the states. 
    Though you may notice there are several Americans among his 831 virtual 
    friends. Thank God, for myspace, right?</p></div>"|8811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8811-tales-of-the-forgotten-melodies/|5.9|Sean Fennessey

From 1996's <em>Perfect From Now On</em> through 2001's <em>Ancient Melodies of the Future</em>, Built to Spill records served as a reliable platform for Doug Martsch's plaintive and layered songwriting, brought to life by a band whose talent and proficiency at times seemed boundless.  <em>You in Reverse</em> marks the first steps of an unexpected third chapter in the group's saga, casting off the usual meticulous guitar overdubs and studio polish in favor of a less refined, more spontaneous approach.</p><p>
    
    While the results are spotty, the change itself is welcome. <em>Ancient Melodies of the Future</em> was short on inspiration but flawlessly executed; tracks like ""You Are"" showed that the band could still make good on a paucity of musical ideas.  By contrast, they sound downright energized on <i>You in Reverse</i>.  The first Built to Spill album in a decade not to feature Phil Ek's crystalline production, <i>You in Reverse</i> wastes no time in establishing itself as its own distinct entity within the band's catalog: As the album begins, drummer Scott Plouf lays down an urgent backbeat that immediately blasts away the band's recent complacency, establishing opener ""Goin' Against Your Mind"" as one of their most insistent and muscular songs.</p><p>
    
    That same spirit is evident on ""Conventional Wisdom"", which evokes the best of 1999's <em>Keep It Like a Secret</em> by pairing an explosive guitar hook with a characteristically strong Martsch vocal melody. While Ek might have pushed ""Conventional Wisdom"" toward restrained transcendence, here it conveys an unchecked exuberance that hasn't graced a Built to Spill record since <em>There's Nothing Wrong With Love</em>. Or at least, it does so for about two minutes, at which point Martsch stops singing and a totally unnecessary four-minute guitar jam ensues.</p><p>
    
    Long songs are by no means new for Built to Spill but <em>You in Reverse</em> suffers from a lack of structure that leaves much of it sounding indulgent and extraneous. The longer songs on the classic <em>Perfect From Now On</em> invariably included a few grand but unobtrusive structural changes, as well as subtle shifts in dymanics and feel-- ""Velvet Waltz"", with its layers of shimmering guitar and reverberating percussion, seems downright economical at eight minutes. Most of the songs on <em>You in Reverse</em> start at full-blast, and the band often seems to have trouble figuring out where to go from there-- when the chorus rolls around at minute five of ""Wherever You Go"", not much has changed since the chorus three minutes prior.</p><p>
    
    Aside from its abundance of overlong songs, <em>You in Reverse</em> is marred by a lack of strong melody when compared to Built to Spill's other records; aside from ""Conventional Wisdom"", nothing on <em>You in Reverse</em> approaches the seamless melodic dexterity of the band's best work. And yet this is also their most promising statement in years; far from the lovely stagnation of <em>Ancient Melodies</em>, <em>You in Reverse</em> suffers from the awkwardness of new beginnings.</p></div>"|1016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1016-you-in-reverse/|6.8|Matt LeMay

Of course, Trent turned that trifecta on the Billboard Modern Rock chart, where hits are gauged by radio play-- not sales to the record-buying public.  Perhaps surprisingly, then, <em>Every Day Is Exactly the Same</em> is the first stateside EP lifted from <em>With Teeth</em>.  To compensate, the folks at Interscope and Nothing did the right thing and compiled remixes previously available only on import releases and 12"" singles. If you've already been buying on import, only the ""Every Day"" remix is new to this EP, and it's the track that most disappoints.</p><p>
    
    The first radio release from <em>With Teeth</em>, ""The Hand That Feeds"", is given two treatments. The DFA do what they do best, starting with some Pac-Man burbles before their requisite 4/4 disco pulse infiltrates the song's angst-ridden heart, replacing the pro-forma NIN ruckus and plumping the track up to nine minutes.  They also slow down Reznor's vocals just enough to put them in step with this new, slinkier beat.  It's disorienting at first if you're familiar with the original, and it accentuates the lesser qualities of Reznor's lyrical bent, but the treatment works beautifully. By contrast, Photek's ""Straight Mix"" of ""Hand"" is as advertised. He does nothing more to the tune than pad it with starch-- some drum machine, some coming-up synths, and an extended strobe-light outro. Despite the additions, the song emerges relatively unchanged.</p><p>
    
    There are also two additional versions of the album's second single, ""Only"", with remixers El-P and Richard X approaching the track very differently. El-P's version is claustrophobic; he takes Reznor's speak/sung narrative and uses the downtrodden backing to accentuate the paranoia inherent within the babbling. Lonely horn blasts and what sounds like a warbling robot turkey splatter the turgid soundscape, turning a seemingly flighty, self-castigating jaunt into a harrowing (and somewhat cloying) experience. Richard X turns that psychosis upside-down. Ignoring any possible subtext within the lyric, Richard treats the song the way he does tracks by Annie and the Sugababes-- speed the tempo up, add some glitter and percussion, and get people dancing. Both these remixes work, but Trent's cathartic hair-pulling sounds much more comfortable in Richard X's hands.</p><p>
    
    The new remix is cold and ordinary, with Interpol rhythm section Sam Fogarino and Carlos D. doing for ""Every Day"" what U2's Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr. did for the ""Mission Impossible"" theme a few years back: they ""remix"" it. Out are most of the vocals, excepting some shouts, some cooing, and the chorus. You know, in case you forget what song you're listening to. Lots of traditional remix flourishes flaunt over the course of the track's five-minute length, none doing much of anything to enhance or treat the song-- and then it's over. It's a disappointing way for a record to end. Just click back a few tracks and forget it ever happened.</p></div>"|5805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5805-every-day-is-exactly-the-same-ep/|6.4|David Raposa

The neighborhooded non-heroics were typical: Major Stars <i>should</i> play the band next door, even if their publicist sort of apologized in an e-mail to me for them sounding like a ""generic bar band.""  He likes the record, too; I think he figured I'd need glamour to get with it, though I didn't. But I can empathize: One time (in these pages, matter of fact), I also tried to sell Major Stars on a bigger ticket-- ""rock reclamation"" or something like that-- and had to wait six months (and see 'em in two different bars) before realizing they <em>were</em> a bar band, and thank God for it.</p><p>
    
    Like lots of bar bands, Major Stars know an awful lot of music (Wayne Rogers and Kate Village run one of the most insanely specialized music shops in the country), and they also enjoy a good fiery solo (try ""Syntoptikon""). Their band has just enough members to be awkward on any stage (three guitarists, a bassist, designated vocalist, flailing drummer), and when they play, they seem to out-drink half of the audience. They also have bar-band stagemoves down: Rogers thrusts his hips when he lights up his guitar; Village does a good guitar-as-dick; and Sandra Barrett kinda runway-walks across the stage when she sings.</p><p>
    
    Unlike a lot of bar bands, Major Stars are also a full-on psych group, albeit not dull or abstruse. They have groove, thanks to Dave Dougan's bass and Casey Keenan's ability to keep time across five-minute string-improvs, and almost every vocal part is melodic beyond the standard psych wail/drug mumble.</p><p>
    
    After the release of last summer's ""Black Road"" b/w ""Pocket"" single-- my favorite of 2005-- I wrote that Major Stars' songs ""worship the guitar without worshipping the inflated package it sometimes hides,"" a critique that turned out to be more about my hang-ups than theirs. Those two songs are included here and they are nothing but monolithic package-swinging (though half the time, at least, the package is female-appended): <i>Syntoptikon</i> dreams big. Who cares about access to a band playing rock music (even I've been in a band!)? It's no fun unless they still want to change somebody by doing it, or get laid by doing it-- two things that are surely the same. </p><p>
    
    ""Collapsing"" makes indelible a mere 1:25 of Barrett, with two slashing chords and set-forth-the-army snares; she's all octaves and nostalgia, then stands back as Rogers &amp; co. chorus in circles around her wayback dream. ""Fake Date"" comes on more non-committal (as did ""Pocket"" and ""Black Road"", and as ""Cinnamon and Lightning"" is here, though it's catchy as fuck), but then the rhythm drops out and the nonchalance is just a front: There's even an avenging riff to make you forget the lapse.</p><p>
    
    This is also, presumably, why they've got ""The Ravager"" and ""Syntoptikon"" around, to bury the bleeding soft parts. It doesn't work-- <i>Syntoptikon</i> will be a record that leaves a mark, it's too raw to do otherwise-- but that's rock for you: The guitar always has <i>something</i> behind it, and sometimes above it, too.</p></div>"|5654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5654-syntoptikon/|8.4|Zach Baron

    So in this sense, Nuremburg quintet the Robocop Kraus' U.S. debut (and fourth album overall) couldn't be better timed. Their version of post-punk lops off the ""st-punk"" part and just adds a ""p"" to the end, adhering to the genre's premium on mechanistic rhythmic precision-- and what do Germans know better than precision-- but with the sharp angles and jagged edges gilded into smooth, shiny (and sometimes indistinguishable) surfaces. That could also be said of every aspiring skinny-tie merchant from the Killers to We Are Scientists, but the Robocop Kraus are a more sublime, less marketable prospect, and not just because they name-drop Drive Like Jehu, base songs around the rinky-dink Casiotones from Trio's ""Da Da Da"", and have a bass player who looks like D. Boon.<lp>
<em>They Think They Are the Robocop Kraus</em> dwells on mundane matters that would put most faux-hawked fashionistas to sleep: proletariat politics, morning commutes, and urban planning. But the Robocop Kraus are not here to smash the system, but rather question it, over fine wine and congenial conversation. The most immediately engaging track here pays tribute to German Mattias Rust's 1987 Cessna flight into Moscow's Red Square, but it sums up the band's ethos in the simplest, most polite terms: It's called ""You Don't Have to Shout"", and as the song ably demonstrates, it's much more gratifying to clap your hands than raise your voice. </lp></p><p>
    
    The Robocop Kraus' mild-mannered temperament would be a greater liability were it not for the consistently spirited performances of frontman Thomas Lang: On ""You Don't Have to Shout"", he's an Alex Kapranos who doesn't have to check himself in the mirror every 20 seconds, while on opener ""After Laughter Comes Tears"", he mainlines the inquisitive intensity that David Byrne brought to ""Life During Wartime"". And when the songs do push Lang outside of his comfort zone-- like on the overwrought balladic turn ""Life Amazes Us Despite Our Miserable Future"", or the brazen Brit affectations on ""There Are Better Lights in Hollywood""-- his mates are there to back him up with game-saving group choruses better suited to the union hall than the discotheque. If nothing else, the Robocop Kraus should go down as one of the few post-millennial post-punk bands to remind us that white belts and blue collars do not clash.</p></div>"|6955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6955-they-think-they-are-the-robocop-kraus/|6.7|Stuart Berman

    steeplechase of record reviewing is the latest craze
    of RIYL-ism (pronounced rye-ill-iz-um). RIYL (""Recommended If You Like,"" for those of you not versed
    in the parlance) is the bane of the music writer's
    existence, the awful fate to which all periodicals
    seem to be headed. As word counts asymptote toward
    zero, reviews become little more than lists of
    soundalike bands, subjects and verbs and adjectives
    reduced to a series of ""If you love X, then you'll dig
    Y"" equations.</p><p>
    
    Yet even with the yards of white space awarded me by
    the Pitchfork Powers, the temptation of RIYL-ism
    occasionally remains strong. Sure, I can gussy up the
    mathematics with rococo prose, but the essence of the
    essay would be the same: Invoking bands to talk about
    other bands to weigh the value of the primary band.
    Sometimes the influence of an ancestor is just too
    strong, and you can't help but weigh the pros and cons
    of a derivative sound. Sometimes triangulating an
    artist's sound is easier done with record-store
    touchstones than paragraphs of description.</p><p>
    
    Or sometimes, a critic just feels like he's reviewed
    the album already. That's the case with me and
    Envelopes, the Franco-Swede quintet currently gliding
    on a thin layer of SXSW buzz. Almost exactly a year
    ago, I enthusiastically tackled Architecture in
    Helsinki's <em>In Case We Die</em>, praising it as a landmark
    of the fickle-pop movement sweeping across the
    indie-rock league. <em>Demon</em>, the Envelopes' debut, is a
    near doppelganger of that album, down to its multitude
    of vocalists, its adorable accents (""It Is the Law"",
    coming out something like Hopelandic), its short
    attention span, its 50s-style romanticism, and its
    infectious giddiness. </p><p>
    
    The second helping of dessert is never as good,
    however, and much of <em>Demon</em>, despite its resemblance
    to other cherished albums of recent history, gives me
    a toothache. All the right elements are in place:
    Liberal use of blippy synthesizers, songs that travel
    in unexpected directions, a few choice examples of
    boy/girl vocal volleying. Yet songs like ""My Fern""
    and ""Glue"" have melodies that enchant while in
    progress, but evaporate when the song ends, a side
    effect, perhaps, of the band's restless arrangements.</p><p>
    
    Divergences from the AiH sound seem to linger a little
    longer: The Decemberists/Of Montreal nasal
    storytelling of ""Isabelle and Leonard"", for instance,
    or moments like ""Sister in Love"" where the band gets a
    little Pixies-style abrasive. But too many precious
    moments weigh the band down, cutesy twee like ""Audrey
    in the Country"" or ""Massouvement""-- rote indie pop
    with a budget.</p><p>
    
    After a while, the genre contraction and melody
    U-turns sum up to zero, leaving Envelopes with a
    viscous sound that's hard to grip. The failing might
    not entirely rest with the band itself though, coming
    along as they do on what might the tail end of indie
    rock's ADD phase, where anyone keeping up has heard
    this routine already. Then again, forthcoming releases
    like Danielson's <em>Ships</em> and the Fiery Furnaces' <em>Bitter
    Tea</em> don't show signs of fickle-pop fatigue, an
    argument for the prosecution. The truth may be that
    Envelopes are simply C+ purveyors of the sound, good
    for passing a half-hour, but in the end, worthy of
    nothing deeper than RIYL-ism.</p></div>"|2939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2939-demon/|6.2|Rob Mitchum

People who hate emo often do so for reasons that have little to do with the music-- they hate its cliquey cachet, its asymmetrical haircuts, its Hot Topic couture and predictable tattoos. An aversion to the music itself-- the stock dynamic changes, monochromatic vocals, oblivious self-obsession, and an obviousness that borders on emotional manipulation-- is almost an afterthought. Where emo is stylish, post-rock cultivates an anti-style, and people who are into vibrancy might find themselves turned off by its drab trappings and grave seriousness, not to mention the stuffy pretensions that can mar the music. To take the negative view, post-rock is cold, sterile, overly cerebral, and gives itself too much credit for rote gestures masquerading as innovations.</p><p> 
    Appleseed Cast's latest picks up more or less where <em>Two Conversations</em> left off-- if there's any difference, <em>Peregrine</em> is even more stately and impressionistic than its predecessor. I want to call this album ""post-emo,"" as it blends the better traits of each genre-- emo's warmth but not its grating bombast; post-rock's ambition but not its obscurity-- allowing them to temper one another. Whether the record scans as unusually adventurous emo or as unusually melodic post-rock is up to you, but I find this happy medium to be much more palatable than the lion's share of what each genre produces by its own lights. Despite its atmospheric trappings and intricate arrangements, <em>Peregrine</em> never loses sight of its grand melodies, which unfold with patience and restraint.</p><p> 
    The ice-blue arpeggios of ""Ceremony"" ring out bell-clear; offset by shuddering washes of noise in the background, they begin to wrap around themselves and are soon shattered by pounding drums. The shards coalesce like rewinding film several times before they blow apart into a final, triumphant cacophony. On ""Woodland Hunter (Part I)"", warm guitar chords and a muffled vocal melody levitate in the middle distance, then leap to the foreground for an outsized verse. The glitchy, staticky drums hop adroitly between channels; sonorous feedback stutters and blinks like reflected light, and one wants to make a crack about the emo Dntel, if the Postal Service didn't render it redundant. ""Here We Are (Family in the Hallways)"" strongly evokes Death Cab's ""Title and Registration"", from its tripping guitar line to its dreamy vocal melody to its floating, syncopated percussion. It still might be a little too gooey for post-rock diehards, but with <em>Peregrine</em>, Appleseed Cast just might have made an emo record for people who hate emo. </p></div>"|262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/262-peregrine/|7.3|Brian Howe

He was more     than just ""around,"" of course; he was also making history on his     pioneering pop albums and the records on which he invented     ambient music. But Eno seemed to be on hand for a sharp observation     even when he wasn't directly involved. From his instant recognition of     Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" as a watershed moment in pop, his     tireless championing of German bands that would later be canonized, to his role as the curator the <i>No New York</i> album, Eno     was always understood to have exceptional taste. Perhaps that's why he     saw such success as a producer, a job that requires above all that one     be a good listener.</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, Eno was particularly enamored with the synthesized     music Dieter Moebius and Hans Joachim Roedelius were making as     Cluster. He traveled to the town of Forst, Germany, where Cluster     lived and worked in their home studio, and began a collaboration that     would result in two classic albums.</p>
<p>The first recorded material to     emerge from this meeting was <i>Cluster &amp; Eno</i>, which was recorded in June 1977 at Conny Plank's studio, and suggested that the     collaboration was completely organic. Eno's relentless sound     experimentation helped Cluster get the most out of their synthesizers;     the record is filled with textures that must have seemed     otherworldly in 1977, but still manage to hold up today. The vibrato     quiver of the Moog in ""Schone Hande"", for example, overflows with     tension and mystery, soundtracking perhaps a hesitant exploration of a     potentially hostile alien planet. Piano is in the foreground on ""Wehrmut"" and ""Mit Simaen""; at that time, a few notes     on a baby grand with the sustain pedal to the metal brought to mind     the furniture music of Satie and sounded terrific surrounded by wispy     synths. On tracks like the warmly percolating ""Ho Renomo"", Cluster     contributed a heightened ear for melody and an     interest in repetition that pointed directly to where electronic music     would eventually go. <i>Cluster &amp; Eno </i>demonstrates that the parties had     developed along parallel paths but discovered something new and fresh     by working together.</p>
<p>When they convened again a number of months later, the trio dropped     the Cluster name and turned its focus in the general direction of     song. <i>After the Heat</i> differs sharply from its predecessor in tone, as well as its English language titles and the occasional vocal presence of Eno. ""Most of the day we were at the machinery,"" he sings on     ""The Belldog"", alluding perhaps to the creative ferment happening in     Plank's studio. With evocative synths bubbling underneath, ""The     Belldog"" sounds like a more technically sophisticated update of     <i>Another Green World</i>, like the three had happened upon a new sort     of music that would one day grow noisier and be called dreampop. For     ""Tzima N'arki"", Moebius and Roedelius constructed an anxious simulation     of a modern string quartet while Can's Holgar Czukay adds a dubby     bass; Eno's vocals are played backward and somehow don't sound     appreciably weirder than they normally do. ""If God had listened to me/     None of this would ever had occurred,"" is what he's actually singing;     had they recorded this song in the late 1990s, I'd think he was talking     about alternative rock. Eno does his talk/rap thing on ""Broken Head"",     a menacing slab of slowburn funk with an unchanging bass and drums     groove and strange noises spinning off in all directions. A few     piano-centered instrumentals hint at the sound of the earlier record,     but <i>After the Heat</i> exists in a fantastic sphere of its own.</p>
<p>They'd made brilliant records before hooking up with Eno, but Moebius     and Roedelius have never shied from acknowledging the impact the     association had on their approach to sound. The two compilations     bearing the title <i>Begegnungen</i> (German for ""encounter"") give an idea of     the different ways those initial seeds sprouted. Adding Plank to     the name of the project, both <i>Begegnungen </i>volumes compile tracks     from the sessions with Eno along with contemporaneous solo and Cluster     material in a similar vein. ""Johanneslust"" is a gorgeous solo     Roedelius track from 1978, where he combines a simple acoustic guitar     pattern with synths in a manner that reinforces the bucolic ""back to     nature"" possibility of electronics. ""Nervös"" and ""Pitch Control"", both     from 1983, bring the earlier experiments into the realm of 80s     electro-pop. The former is solo Moebius with a grim layer of     industrial soot, while the latter finds Cluster working with Guru Guru     drummer Mani Neumeier to reclaim the stiff funk of Herbie Hancock's <i>Future Shock</i> for the European continent.</p>
<p>In Moebius and Roedelius' favor, they never seemed bound by orthodoxy-- genre experiment came naturally to them, as     evidenced by the title of their 1981 album <i>Rastakraut Pasta</i>.     ""Conditionierer"" from <i>Begegnungen II</i> actually moves into the realm of     hyper-minimal country &amp; western, with a perky guitar groove and     bottleneck slide. And then     Roedelius' 1978 piece ""Mr. Livingstone"" gorgeously combines     gamelan-style gongs with indeterminate far Eastern scales. Despite a     dull patch or two, both volumes of <i>Begegnungen</i> are constantly engaging     and full of surprises.</p>
<p>The late 1970s and early 1980s were a fantastically exciting time to     be making electronic music, as technology changed almost     daily and possibilities expanded exponentially. In such a chaotic and     unfixed environment, it took smart people with a strong musical sense     to make the most of it.

""We're about the last band in the world that has not shot a DVD,"" Robert Forster announces between songs on DVD/CD combo <i>That Striped Sunlight Sound</i>, ""So we're doing one tonight, right here""-- which he of course pronounces ""hee-ya,"" in reference to the Tivoli Theatre in the band's hometown of Brisbane, Australia-- before diving appropriately into ""Streets of Your Town.""</p>
<p>Reenacting here both the times they first immortalized looping entreaties to ""shi-i-i-iine,"" and complaints that, ""I still don't know what I'm here for,"" it's still clear what they're here for: 2005's <i>Oceans Apart improved greatly on the Go-Betweens' previous comeback effort, and provides </i><i>That Striped Sunlight Sound</i> with its peppiest tracks: ""Here Comes a City"", ""Boundary Rider"", ""Born to a Family"", and ""Finding You"" are all extra-robust Red Bull anthems.</p>
<p>But if pop's longtime sunshine-companionship is warranted, it makes tons of sense to call these vets the arbitrators of some striped sunlight sound. This live album comes like midday sun filtering through mini-blinds: barely-there slits, perfectly understated kind of cool (temperature-wise) sunny days alongside major chances of rain. And it comes with proof of what the Go-Betweens do best: the opposite of cloying-- perfectly aware, grown-up, and bittersweet. The low-key ""Black Mule"" and     ""Clouds"" wouldn't otherwise resemble sold-out show material, but here-- spouted not from the mouths of babes but full-grown old dudes-- they're perfect, somehow. Sure we could gripe about the lack of favorites (where's ""Dive for Your Memory""?), but let's be grateful for what this is: After a long dry spell, ""Spring Rain"" has been a long time coming: ""Don't know where I'm going/ Don't know where it's blowing/ But I know it's finding you.""</p>
<p>""You"" meaning us, of course. Hand-clapped, whistled interims are proof that no band is an island, and the Go-Betweens are no exception to the rule: On <i>That Striped Sunlight Sound</i>, fans and cheesy concert-cheers are as indispensable as the guitars themselves. While those who accuse the band of overcultishness might cite the record's idiosyncratic and nerdy overload-- the Go-Bees, after all, perform debut 1978 single ""Karen"", call ""James Joyce"" the ""right choice,"" and namedrop great Russians in that dead-on line from <i>Oceans Apart</i> (""Why do people who read Dostoyevsky look like Dostoyevsky?"")-- there's something bigger and farther-reaching than geek rock at work here. Here's what potential and happiness sounds like in the face of rain, and God knows what else.</p></div>"|3480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3480-that-striped-sunlight-sound/|8.3|Rachel Khong

The ""song"" remains as a corporeal latticework, holding everything together with personable charisma, while the ""track"" elements (riffs, beats, noisy eruptions) are marshalled into elaborately staged configurations, sometimes mimicking verse-chorus structures, and sometimes lavishly unveiled in epic movements that would make Pink Floyd proud.</p><p>
    
    Pearson's notion is typical of a generalized will-to-overproduction that motivates many of the best artists in contemporary dance music, from Dominik Eulberg to Jacques Lu Cont, to offer their most interesting work as remixes for other artists. The DFA would probably sympathise as well: At their expansive best, the DFA's remixes can resemble gleaming, lavishly detailed architectural structures. It is here, rather than on artist projects such as LCD Soundsystem, that you can hear most clearly James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy's understanding of disco as a space of infinite possibility, the 4/4 beat providing a continuum around which all manner of grandiose visions can be assembled and demolished.</p><p>
    
    The word ""disco"" must be emphasised: Whatever else Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy might throw on top, it's that endless throb that forms the core of the the duo's work. Owing to their label's benefaction of rock and noise acts, it's tempting to claim that the DFA have summoned up some sort of utopian, pan-genre ""One Nation Under a Groove"" vibe in which passing resemblances to <em>Tago Mago</em> or <em>Remain in Light</em> signal rock's discovery of a way to make dance music that's not, y'know <em>Dance Music</em>. But the DFA's rock credentials are just that, granting them a context and an audience that allows their engagement with dance's mind-altering flights of fancy to appear more exciting and unprecedented than they otherwise might. An illusion, then, but a viscerally effective one.</p><p>
    
    It helps the duo's rock cred that their drums usually sound like they've been recorded live in a chicken coop using a Dictaphone, but listen to the assembled remixes on this compilation in chronological order, and it becomes clear that the DFA have all along been engaged in a flight from rock. Sure, their version of Radio 4's ""Dance to the Underground"" might be the archetypal ""disco-punk"" track, smothering the sharp, jolting restlessness of the original with deep disco bass, eerie keyboards, and dub echo. But it's the act of smothering itself that is important, not the sharpness of what is smothered: Early remix efforts for Le Tigre, Fischerspooner, and Metro Area all come out blearier and hazier (not to mention better) than the originals, their wonky live feel evocative not of punk energy but the thrilling anxiety that at any moment the groove might fall apart, as if the possibility of making mistakes is covalent with the possibility of making magic. It's not disco-punk but disco-hippy, and with each new effort the team's pretence at starsailing becomes more pronounced.</p><p>
    
    Which is not to say that these astral navigators don't have a formula. In fact, some have complained that hearing these remixes back-to-back makes their formula a bit too pointedly clear; for example, remixes of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's ""Mars, Arizona"" and Gorillaz's ""Dare"" share the exact same disco-rock to noisy freak out trajectory (of the two, ""Mars, Arizona"" wins out simply for compressing the trajectory more ruthlessly). But a formula ain't necessarily a bad thing: Think of it as a carefully considered training technique, designed to flex and strengthen certain sonic muscles in aid of achieving ever more impressive results.  </p><p>
    
    The duo's remix of Goldfrap's ""Slide In"" (reserved for the sequel to this volume) is the formula's pinnacle, as well as their most unashamedly psychedelic effort to date, moving seamlessly from blocky live disco to a shamanist wipe-out somewhere between Can and Orbital. Ewan Pearson claims that it inspired him to make his own 15-minute, two-part ""Disco Odyssey"" remix for Goldfrapp, and it's fitting that in this environment of sonic cross-pollination and oneupmanship, the DFA return the favour on their Pearsonesque remix of the Chemical Brothers' ""The Boxer"", a synth-laden Balearic house number that shimmers with unabashed gorgeousness. Alongside the stark, eerie techno balladry of their remix of Hot Chip's ""Just Like We (Breakdown)"" it's this compilation's most starry-eyed and astonishing moment. All of which suggests that the DFA's finest and furthest-out work may lie yet further inside dance music's sticky and intimate embrace. </p></div>"|2034.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2034-the-dfa-remixes-chapter-one/|8.2|Tim Finney

This was a move that seems entirely in keeping with the outfit's history-- Tanakh has always exhibited a reluctance to stay affixed in one place. Over the course of their three prior albums, Tanakh's music has drifted serenely across foggy intersections of pan-ethnic folk, improvised drones, and psychedelic pop. Now, perhaps guided in part by homesickness, the group has built upon 2004's <em>Dieu Deuil</em> to craft their most purely song-oriented collection to date (and arguably the most accessible Alien8 release ever) by subtly guiding their sound towards the organic, refracted Americana of acts like Calexico or Pinetop Seven.</p><p>
    
    In its past incarnations, Tanakh often seemed to be simply comprised of Poe and whatever collaborators happened to be handy, but on <em>Ardent Fevers</em> the musicians have taken on the unmistakable appearance of an actual band. Recorded by Brian Hoffa, who has worked with groups ranging from Labradford to Camper Van Beethoven, and featuring contributions from Isobel Campbell and Alex Neilson, the album is veritably bursting with amplified color and detail. The songs were co-written by Poe and guitarist Umberto Trivella, a partnership that grants the material an enhanced, groove-centered propulsion that is further punctuated by the frequent addition of Muscle Shoals-style horns, dustbowl lap steel, and surprising abundance of hypercharged, Crazy Horse guitar soloing.</p><p>
    
    With its thoughtful construction and heavy emphasis on Poe's dusky vocals, <em>Ardent Fevers</em> might seem unrecognizable to listeners only familiar with the grainy, abstract textures of 2004's self-titled double album. The differences should be apparent right from the opening notes of ""Drink to Sher"", which masterfully combines front-porch guitars and jazzy horns, or on the soulful, brassy ""Deeper"", which rides an elegant swell of <em>Blonde on Blonde</em> organ. In the past, Tanakh's use of violin and strings could often lend the music a certain Eastern European gypsy flourish, but here, on such tracks as ""Like I Used To"", they also help provide a distinctly C&amp;W; atmosphere, issuing a quiet floorboard creak beneath Poe's dusty boots.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, on tracks like the delicate ""Restless Hands"" or the brooding ""Winter Song"", Tanakh return to the more familiar waters of Fairport-style UK folk-rock, directed by Poe's sweet melodies and unerring sense for the understated narrative. And so it also appears on the rainswept, Leonard Cohen climes of ""Still Trying To Find You Home"", before Poe and Trivella unveil a blistering, wholly unforeseen dual guitar jam. This process is later repeated on the set-closing ""Take and Read"", and though these are the exact sort of solos that Neil Young should just have gone ahead and patented 25 years ago, there's no denying that their sudden appearance provides the album with a crucial, throat-scorching jolt of undiluted cactus juice.</p><p>
    
    As with Tanakh's previous releases, there is a sense of loss or dislocation that hovers mirage-like around the edges here, as though the whole mysterious enterprise might vanish in a cloud of smoke if addressed too directly. Intoxicating though it is, <em>Ardent Fevers</em> leaves the listener with little concise idea about what exactly constitutes Tanakh's true sound or which direction they might travel next, but this vague disorientation shouldn't be enough to discourage repeat investigations into the matter.</p></div>"|7929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7929-ardent-fevers/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

Why certain projects and albums were chosen over others isn't clear, but for now Geffen/Universal has spit-shined     the 1982 self-titled debut EP, 1989's Madonna-fixated <i>The Whitey Album</i> (credited to Ciccone Youth),     and Thurston's 1995 solo debut, <i>Psychic Hearts</i>. Beyond the requisite     history lesson and catalogue gap-filling, the triad's dropped     in anticipation of the band's 15th studio     album, <i>Rather Ripped</i>, which is out in June, and maybe as a nod to Ecstatic Peace!, Moore's excellent experimental and noise label, teaming with Universal.</p>
<p>All three albums have their moments, but the five-song debut gives the most band for your buck.     Packaged with extensive (and worthwhile) liner notes from Byron Coley,     Glenn Branca, original Sonic Youth drummer Richard Edson, and a note from Moore regarding the     relation of reggae and Can to the tracks contained     therein, <i>Sonic Youth</i> is also bolstered by seven live tracks and     an early demo, all from 1981. Obviously more primitive than the quartet's later work,     the recordings offer a ghostly, mesmerizing locked groove. My favorite     aspect of the EP is the band's willingness to take its     time: ""Burning Spear"" tries a hand at post-punk dub that     swivels with Gordon's bass line and Edson's drum breaks. As Coley     thoughtfully notes, that song's amazing sound of an     airplane lift-off or wind filtering through a crumbled lofts is     actually Ranaldo's ""contact mic'd electric drill"" filtered     through wah. On the track, Moore's vocals are haunting and urgent,     like he's pinned to a mattress on the floor of his East     Village apartment: ""I'm not afraid to say I'm scared/ In my bed I'm     deep in prayer/ I trust the speed/ I love the fear.""</p>
<p>This is SY at their most icy; it's an erudite, windswept set, wrapping     distortion inside danceable half-frozen Liquid Liquid beats. Even the     EP's hand-drum rocker, ""I Don't Want to Push It"", is a gust of slush     in a Bowery puddle. Moore takes over bass duties on the lengthy, jumpy instrumental closer ""The Good and the Bad"". Elsewhere, the bonus live stuff swelters: a super elastic ""Burning Spear"" is impressive and a rip-roaring version of ""She Is Not Alone""     contrasts the restrained studio take.</p>
<p>If <i>Sonic Youth</i>'s a chilly midnight haze, <i>The Whitey Album</i> tilts toward a confetti-lined karaoke jamboree. Finding the     crew, along with Mike Watt (who offers liner notes penned in 1993),     adopting Madonna's surname, Ciccone Youth are hopped-up on hand     claps, drum machinations, lo-fi industrial, repetitious loops, and     wily cover tunes. All that, and you get to hear Moore rap. Critics     tend to highlight the sight gags like the meta ""Two Cool Rock Chicks     Listening to Neu"", with Gordon and friend talking over a stereo about     the possibilities of managing Dinosaur (Mascis shows up with a     humongous guitar wail), that minute of Cagean silence, and Watt's     cow-polk cover version of ""Burnin' Up"", which hits me like a disco     take on his cover of Daniel Johnston's ""Walking the Cow"". (Historical     note: Greg Ginn lays down an extra guitar.) That's fine-- these     oddities are pretty choice-- but there are much better musical bits.</p>
<p>Something you might not remember: <i>The Whitey Album</i>'s packed with     gorgeous instrumentals like ""Macbeth"", which     piles up drum machines, fuzzing guitars, and catchy Cure-like     chord rings. Opener ""Needle-Gun"" is Fat     Albert-style No-Wave. There's also a bit of     self-sampling: ""Platoon II""'s echo drums and gentle guitar drabs are a     vocal-free take of the Gordon-fronted ""G-Force"". Of course, you'll     also hear Gordon's cheesy, but wonderfully droll ""Addicted to Love""     and their most famous cover, an echo-dub     implosion of Madonna's ""Into the Groove"", recast as ""Into the     Groovey"".</p>
<p>Released after <i>Experimental Jet Set Trash and No     Star</i> and joined by Steve Shelley on drums and Tim Foljahn on second     guitar, Moore's femme-themed solo debut, <i>Psychic Hearts</i>, is a     collection of often-beautiful sunset guitar rock. Of his vocal turns, my favorite is the caffeinated, teen-angst/dysfunction of the propulsive title track. Moore's     vocals are also particularly swoon-worthy on the     whispery ""Pretty Bad"" and breathy ""Ono Soul"".</p>
<p>Most of <i>Psychic Hearts</i>, however, works because of the simple repetitions of instrumentals like     lilting opener ""Blues From Beyond the Grave"" and the gently paranoid ""(I Got a)     Catholic Block"" patterning that surfaces between Moore's voice in ""Feathers"". The centerpiece is the 20-minute instrumental exeunt, ""Elegy for All the Dead Rock *s"". The track's distinct movements mingle fluidly, swerving into a sideways cascade before bursting and blooming until notes sharpen     and a final tidal wave arcs and releases. The noise     implosions of its final third are anti-climactic, but after some gentle plucks and slides,     Moore grabs his pick and glides into that dark night as gorgeously as     he began, only this time with more triumphal drums.</p>
<p>God, Sonic Youth's catalogue is vast. For even the biggest fans, it     can take a reissue to suggest refocusing on     something you've previously taken for granted. (Proust fans are     nodding in agreement.) <i>Psychic Hearts</i> was, for whatever reason, still     pretty embedded in my memory, but I had mostly forgotten the precise,     trashcan regality of the EP. <i>The Whitey Album</i>, something I'd relegated     to the Mr. T Experience section of my memory, was the biggest     surprise: Collecting dust in my closet, this fucker has some     incredibly catchy and flat-out kick ass and moving moments. If you've     never heard any of this stuff, take a peak at what your guitar heroes     were up to when they were a tad younger. If, like me, you assumed     you'd moved past it: Go back and realize you haven't.</p></div>"|11832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11832-sonic-youth-the-whitey-album-psychic-hearts/|8.2|Brandon Stosuy

Moore's     vocals are also particularly swoon-worthy on the     whispery ""Pretty Bad"" and breathy ""Ono Soul"".</p>
<p>Most of <i>Psychic Hearts</i>, however, works because of the simple repetitions of instrumentals like     lilting opener ""Blues From Beyond the Grave"" and the gently paranoid ""(I Got a)     Catholic Block"" patterning that surfaces between Moore's voice in ""Feathers"". The centerpiece is the 20-minute instrumental exeunt, ""Elegy for All the Dead Rock *s"". The track's distinct movements mingle fluidly, swerving into a sideways cascade before bursting and blooming until notes sharpen     and a final tidal wave arcs and releases. The noise     implosions of its final third are anti-climactic, but after some gentle plucks and slides,     Moore grabs his pick and glides into that dark night as gorgeously as     he began, only this time with more triumphal drums.</p>
<p>God, Sonic Youth's catalogue is vast. For even the biggest fans, it     can take a reissue to suggest refocusing on     something you've previously taken for granted. (Proust fans are     nodding in agreement.) <i>Psychic Hearts</i> was, for whatever reason, still     pretty embedded in my memory, but I had mostly forgotten the precise,     trashcan regality of the EP. <i>The Whitey Album</i>, something I'd relegated     to the Mr. T Experience section of my memory, was the biggest     surprise: Collecting dust in my closet, this fucker has some     incredibly catchy and flat-out kick ass and moving moments. If you've     never heard any of this stuff, take a peak at what your guitar heroes     were up to when they were a tad younger. If, like me, you assumed     you'd moved past it: Go back and realize you haven't.</p></div>"|11832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11832-sonic-youth-the-whitey-album-psychic-hearts/|7.6|Brandon Stosuy

Following a brief resurrection as Th' Corn Gangg, a live side project in which Unicorns songs were recast as backing tracks for MCs like Subtitle and Busdriver,  multi-instrumentalist Nick Diamonds and drummer J'aime Tambeur announced they'd soldier on without guitarist Alden Penner (née Ginger) as Islands. To prove it wasn't just another one of their bat-shit crazy antics, they leaked two mp3s: ""Abominable Snow"", an epic about surviving a yeti sighting, and ""Flesh"", which revealed a sweaty, sexy side to Diamonds' and Tambeur's songwriting. Both songs were outstanding and, just as important, sounded like the work of the Unicorns. (In fact, they were live staples in the band's last days.) But when Diamonds explained they wouldn't be on the new album and then gushed to Pitchfork about how the band's record would be, of all things, inspired by Paul Simon's <em>Graceland</em>, it was anybody's guess as to what <em>Return to the Sea</em> would actually sound like.</p><p>  It turns out that, while Diamonds' <em>Graceland</em> references weren't just snarcastic pranks, <em>Return to the Sea</em> is a sprawling, gorgeous collection of pop songs that draws from disparate sources such as calypso, country, and hip-hop. The record also relies more heavily on organic sounds and structure than the Unicorns' LP did: Where <em>Who Will Cut Our Hair</em> rewarded listeners with unexpected eruptions in the middle of songs or flat-out rockers dropped off a sonic cliff into plaintive minor chords, Islands present a more linear approach in their arrangements. Songs like album opener ""Swans (Life After Death)"" propel forward, picking up steam to the point of bursting. Only after ""Swans"" has marinated for nearly seven minutes, for example, does Tambeur abandon his shuffling and stuttering beats for cathartic, straight-ahead drumming. Islands' charm, then, is all wrapped up in the richness of the production: unusual instrumentation and tiny flourishes create dense compositions that demand repeated listening.</p><p>  For example, on ""Rough Gem""-- a song so insidiously infectious that trepanation may be the only way to get it out of your head-- the main riff is begun by an understated keyboard, picked up midway by plucked violin strings, and completed by a second, more cartoonish synthesizer. All the while, Diamonds cracks puns on his name, declaring ""I'm a girl's best friend/ Can you cut?/ I can cut!/ I'm a rough gem.""</p><p>  ""Volcanoes"", on the other hand, starts by layering meandering lap steel, intermittent triangle, and violins. By the chorus, those violins shed their hillbilly act to become soaring and angelic, like a melodramatic score. Against the strings, Diamonds strums chords and croons in his strained timbre, ""We washed our mouths at the riverbed/ When we noticed something glowing/ It was growing/ Things are going to change,"" before predicting a catastrophic volcano blast that melts Alaska and turns Argentina into some kind of ice land. The lyrics are ridiculous but fun, and ""Volcanoes"" fittingly features the album's most explosive finale, in which all the instrumental elements that have wandered in and out of the song converge for the song's climax.</p><p> <em>Return to the Sea</em> is a case of Diamonds and Tambeur yanking up their anchor and setting sail for new waters, enjoying the freedoms of exploration and discovery. At no point in the record does it feel as if Diamonds is settling into any one genre or style-- hardly a surprise from this shape-shifting songwriter. It won't be a shock if, say, Diamonds and Tambeur announce 18 months from now that Islands is kaput and they're kickstarting another new band. And who really cares? As long as they continue to write songs as striking and immediate as the batch on <em>Return to the Sea</em>, their fans will follow them anywhere.</p><p> </p></div>"|4170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4170-return-to-the-sea/|8.4|John Motley

Bandleader Jerry DiCicca seems to be trying to sidestep the dueling fantasies perpetuated by most hump-hither music, electing to indulge neither the larger-than-sex, overly confident meat-machine approach, nor the sentimental, fluid-free, preemptively nostalgic lovemaker angle. The resulting quest-for-truth middle ground staked out by <em>Sex Brain</em> is, again, plenty awkward. Fans of how 2004's <em>Who Will Walk in the Darkness With You</em> could evoke a restrained, hellish dusk might be well surprised by this disc's spent, tragicomic dawn.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""I Don't Want 2 Fuck"" is as upbeat and reticent as these proceedings get. ""It's all about me,"" the speaker admits, seconds before Canaan Faulkner's accordion suggests a sad Fazoli's in Ireland. DeCicca sings about spooning, ""getting weird,"" existential doubt, and the centrality of mouth-holes before the tune is over, in a voice that is just WTF bizarre. Imagine a stoned-but-bookish, seductive Muppet. Imagine a more fragile Tindersticks (Tenderdicks?), or that faux-comic-relief Jewish guy from ""Saved By the Bell"" if he was a game-spitting mack (The Teaches of Screech?). Either way, this tune stands alongside Naked Raygun's ""No Sex"", Sold Out's ""I Don't Want To Have Sex With You"", and Lust Control's entire discography in the canon of nocturnal-restraint advocacy.</p><p>
    
    ""Friends"" is sung to a tequila bottle. If you've ever forgotten how you ended up in some depraved scenario, this joint's for thee. Hang on for the verse, ""She pulled my pants down/ And said she knows/ My girlfriend."" Memory and fidelity are complicated. Which leads to the ex-lover masturbation fantasy, ""Your Hands"", about olfactory flashbacks and wacking it to Bob Dylan albums, as Noel Sayre's violin weeps and plucks its pubes. ""Dark Plums"" is essentially an homage to the Black Swans' myspace-approved heroes the Dirty Three, a tension experiment seasoned by Horace Roscoe's eerie saxophone. The lyrics oddly go all metaphorical and euphemistic here, as the references to ""juice,"" ""butter,"" and ""jam"" clash with the directness elsewhere, as if even DeCicca wanted to buffer the strange fruit cultivated by bedfellows on the verge of trust (""Are we too good of friends to play?""). ""My Lips"" is a comparably sweet duet with Sara Jurcyk about post-orgasmic ennui. Its refrain, ""Never procreate,"" seems like an emotional prophylactic. </p><p>
    
    My only previous associations with Columbus, Ohio, are the band Moviola and the novel <em>The Right Man For The Job</em> by Mike Magnuson, in which a dude kills a dog with a cinderblock and his girlfriend sets herself on fire. I did a local band search and found acts named Cleavage and Cameltoe to be recommendable, so maybe the place is throttled with a horndog vibe. While so many borderline smug avant-gardists are creating (self-conscious?) freak-folk, the Black Swans' attempt to freakify standard folk song structure, in terms of both Rick James' appetite for action and in terms of unbowed eccentricity, is welcome and laudable. That such atmospheric talents would take such topically riling chances suggests that this band actively seeks apologists instead of boosters, which is fine by me. More a bodice-tugger or fiddler than a ripper, <em>Sex Brain</em> really satisfices.</p></div>"|1199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1199-sex-brain-ep/|8.0|William Bowers

    sophisticated music centered on the downhearted vocals of John Grant.
    Grant's voice is pure and expressive, and with just the right amount of
    reverb it can cut straight through your sternum to your heart. In a sense,
    he's like Patsy Cline in a lower register, the way he allows
    himself to drift through an arrangement, carried as much by the circumstances
    of the lyrics as by the melody.</p><p>
<em>Sorry I Made You Cry</em>, the Denver band's fifth album, offers a good
    explanation of the similarity: Grant and his cohorts are evidently beyond
    smitten with Cline, as well as other forlorn country lasses like
    Connie Francis and Brenda Lee. A collection of covers recorded mostly for
    B-sides and compilations, as well as a few new tracks, <em>Sorry</em> features
    versions of three songs popularized by Cline out of its 11 cuts, with
    a nod each to Francis and Lee.</p><p>
    
    The strongest critique you can level at this album is that it's relentlessly dour, playing each song for maximum sadness. Given
    the disparate recording dates, that's hardly a crime, just an unfortunate
    coincidence. When recording new tracks they might have
    taken pacing into account and put down one up-tempo song. The most aggressively
    depressive song here is a nearly nine-minute version of Rodgers &amp; Hart's ""My
    Funny Valentine"" that wallows in a crawling tempo and features a downright
    jarring synth interlude that sounds like it wandered in from a late-70s
    Vangelis album. Webb Pierce's ""Leavin' on Your Mind"" (Cline's version seems
    to be the touchstone) and Gene DePaul's ""You Don't Know What Love Is"" (the
    Chet Atkins take is the closest forebear to this version) both sound nice,
    but sequencing them at 6 and 7 with their ultra-slow, ultra-sparse
    arrangements causes the middle of the record to sag a bit.</p><p>
    
    More fun is the excellent version of Brenda Lee's ""I'm Sorry"". With just a
    strumming acoustic guitar providing rhythm, Grant and a searching pedal
    steel glide through the song's Western swing melody with amazing grace. The
    solo acoustic take on Cline's ""I Fall to Pieces"" works on the pure strength of
    Grant's voice, while he seems to really enjoy the iffy sexuality his
    delivery imparts to the unchanged lyrics of Connie Francis's ""Where the Boys
    Are"" (which, after all, was written by a man in the first place). The best
    thing here, though, is the cover of Abba's ""Angel Eyes"", which carries a
    rare lightness in its step and cuts straight to the poignancy of the
    lyrical tale noticing an old lover using the same old moves on someone else.</p><p>
    
    Taken as an island, each song on here is very affecting, including the
    opening cover of Nina Simone's daunting ""Black Is the Color"", which
    starts with a repeating trumpet and piano figure and gives way to a vocal
    so beautiful that the song's racially loaded implications melt away. Its
    heaviness is balanced on the other end by a spacey version of Tim Buckley's
    ""Song to the Siren"", replete with echoing slide guitar and gentle shaker
    rhythms. As individually wonderful as some of these versions are, though, it's a bit much to take at once, making this a collection best
    taken in small bites.</p></div>"|1709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1709-sorry-i-made-you-cry/|6.9|Joe Tangari

It had everything: beats, rhymes, more rhymes, some rhymes after that, and Dave Chappelle. Then, someone broke into my car and ran that shit, so I didn't listen to it for five years. A couple of months ago, I found it in a cheapo bin for three bucks. Turns out I mostly liked Hi-Tek, and Talib isn't his friend anymore. So here we have <em>Right About Now</em>, an ""official mixtape,"" whatever that means, released on clearinghouse label Koch Records, and stocked with leftovers and ornery jabs at the status quo. Sigh. Sometimes I get the feeling that Team Positive is playing to lose, like a Def Jam deal is the No. 1 draft pick or something.</p><p>
    
    I respect Kweli for sticking it out, surviving on majors despite their questionable agendas, and give him sky-fives for trumpeting an alternative to crack-snap, but this is music not politics. And even if it were politics, it's the code of the stump: You can tell people what they need to hear, but make it jump. Follow it back to Mel, KRS, Chuck, the Tongues, whatever-- take it back to Robert Johnson if you feel like it. None disregarded the rhythm and the beat as frequently as Kweli. He's made a career out of doing that, and this is more of the same. A prime example is his duet with perennial NYC bridesmaid Papoose on ""The Beast"", which sounds like two dogs barking in a closet. If anyone is a bigger chatterbox than Kweli, it's the 'Poose, and the two of them together equals mental battery. Quiet storms like the clumsy ode to Lauryn Hill (""Ms. Hill"") accentuate the problem, a spacious beat provoking the loquacious Kweli to fill the gaps, which he does like a schoolboy asking out his first date. It doesn't help that the production on these two tracks is second-class, as are most of the beats here, cutout material from previous albums released as a purge before his next proper record.</p><p>
    
    Most promising for that future material are the moments when Kweli jacks the swagger of the very gangsters he scolds. ""Drugs, Basketball &amp; Rap"", with Strong Arm Steady, has Talib clipping phrases and showing uncharacteristic vigor over a Needlz bump, even when he drops a reference to Lemony Snicket. Collaborations with ol' pal Mos Def (""Supreme, Supreme"") and MF Doom (""Fly That Knot"") catch Kweli on his best behavior as well, encouraging him to loosen his collar a bit and follow the lead of his guests. The underappreciated Jean Grae, a recent signee to Kweli's Blacksmith imprint, joins Talib on ""Where You Gonna Run"", but by that point, what was meant as a showcase feels more like an obligation as the album trails off into its closing track.</p><p>
    
    Talib Kweli will have more chances to duplicate the gold he struck with Kanye West on 2002's ""Get By"" because he's been tabbed as the conscience <em>pro tem</em> of CEO rappers like Jay-Z and 50 Cent. While neither of them signed him when they had the chance, his next record will be on a major. But, as Mos Def opens weekends and Dave Chappelle plans his escape route, Kweli is left to his own devices, and, to be honest, he has yet to prove he can succeed under those circumstances. </p></div>"|4551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4551-right-about-now-the-official-sucka-free-mixtape/|5.5|Peter Macia

Revered in DJ circles, respected on singles charts, and still the dance act you're most likely to hear at an indie party, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo have retained an improbable portion of their life force over the years-- despite being flogged alongside the likes of Fatboy Slim and the Prodigy at the altar of electronica in the late 90s, birthing videos arguably more iconic than their songs, and keeping the most leisurely release schedule this side of Kate Bush's home office.</p><p>
    
    Maybe there was something to the presentation. It seemed so gimmicky at first, a couple of hams in robot masks, mugging for the camera. That corny French sensibility was conceivably one misstep away from a drippy house remix of ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" or ""Popcorn"" or ""The Pink Panther Theme"". What we didn't realize was that it was designed for longevity. Whether in the splashy logo or the robot packshots, each ensuing Daft Punk release has arrived with only slight variations on the theme. But now, almost a decade later, is there another dance act from the ""120 Minutes""-era that doesn't seem downright anachronistic in 2006? Norman Cook's Hawaiian shirts, Tom Rowlands' yellow specs, Keith Flint's bald-hawk and jackboots-- all aspirational rockstar images that run counter to dance music's needs by drowning it in nostalgia and making it difficult to locate in the here and now. In comparative terms, Daft Punk have little of that attendant baggage. They are now exactly what they always have been-- something less like people or rockstars and more like complicated engines. Their machinery is their songs, and beyond that, there is nothing.</p><p>
    
    Despite its stuffy title (we'll get to that later), this greatest hits collection actually picks up in 1995, which is when Daft Punk started releasing the string of 12s that led up to <em>Homework</em>, their 1997 debut. It's probably still their best-known era, and <em>Musique</em> features no fewer than six tracks from it, including the underrated title song as well as no-brainers like ""Da Funk"" and ""Around the World"". You've heard them, you love them, and you probably don't really need them on another disc, but strung back-to-back like this, they're still pretty overwhelming.</p><p>
    
    So far, so good. Here's where it gets inexplicable. Of the remaining tracks here, only six are originals, which means a criminal three from 2002's <em>Discovery</em> (full disclosure: this is one of my favorite records of all time) and a criminal (for different reasons) three from 2005's <em>Human After All</em> (full disclosure: <em>Discovery</em> is one of my favorite records of all time). Not only are ""Aerodynamic"", ""Voyager"", and ""Digital Love"" (!!) snubbed in favor of 2005's ""Technologic"" and ""Human After All"", but slam-dunks like ""One More Time"" and ""Around the World"" appear as inferior radio edits. It doesn't help that three very capable but ultimately immaterial Daft Punk remixes (of tracks by Scott Grooves, Ian Pooley, and Gabrielle) are lamely tacked on to the end. Not only do they take up real estate that would have been more wisely earmarked for <em>Musique</em>'s glaring omissions, their curious inclusion suggests higher-than-ordinary levels of label involvement.</p><p>
    
    In other words, small potatoes conspiracy theorists who believe Daft Punk intentionally shit the bed on <em>Human After All</em> so as to accelerate their split from Virgin will have no shortage of material to work with here either. Assembled chronologically, with thoughtless deference to proper singles over tracks and an undiscerning ear for Daft Punk's actual best work, this is a maddeningly incomplete record that has all the hallmarks of a contractual obligation. What saves it is the cumulative thrill of hearing a decade's worth of Daft Punk singles in sequence and once again realizing they're a better act with two-and-a-half albums than most are with five. </p></div>"|2138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2138-musique-vol-1-1993-2005/|8.4|Mark Pytlik

Before every other mainstream rapper was talking about drugs, he was doing it with a weary lived-in authority, proudly defiant and sheepishly defensive at the same time, bragging about getting money but lamenting the fact that he only had one way to do it. But great rappers don't always make great albums, and every one of T.I.'s previous full-lengths had a fatal flaw: desperate grabs at radio love, grossly insincere sex-jams, cobbled-together non-cohesion, or all three. Last summer, I thought Young Jeezy's <em>Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101</em> was the album T.I. should've made. Jeezy isn't half the rapper that T.I. is, but his album-- stunning in its focus and monolithic swagger and deeply nihilistic in worldview-- had more cinematic sweep than anything his progenitor had ever done.</p><p>
    
    All that changes on <em>King</em>. From the opening seconds, something is different: low ominous strings, a regal horn fanfare swooping over funk guitars, and eerie horror-movie pianos welling up from some unseen abyss. The track's producer, Just Blaze, <em>never</em> makes tracks for Southern rappers, but here he's given T.I. a monstrous banger, something very few rappers will enjoy in their careers, and the emcee takes it like it's his birthright, stretching his drawl over the hectic boom like he just didn't have anything better to do. Over the first four tracks, nothing lets up. Texas legends UGK revisit one of their classic trunk-rattlers on ""Front Back"", and T.I. sounds like he's doing <em>them</em> a favor.</p><p>
    
    Single ""What You Know"" is truly epic, DJ Toomp's swollen synth woozily curling up and T.I. eating the track for lunch, beating Jeezy at the ad-lib game before delivering one of those choruses that gets stuck in your head all day and you don't even mind. And ""I'm Talkin' to You"" brings back Just Blaze again, laying down horn-blats with Bomb Squad urgency and T.I. coming heated and dangerous as fuck, utterly destroying some unnamed opponent (""How many different ways is it to say I'm getting cheddar more/ Than niggas twice as old, more popular and even <em>selling</em> more?"") before busting out a head-spinning double-time flow on the last verse. When the dust finally settles, it's for ""Live in the Sky"", a maudlin but pretty ballad, T.I. bitterly lamenting dead friends before going on to regret his own mistakes, the storied seven felonies that mean his life could basically end after one slip-up, Jamie Foxx gingerly cooing the chorus. </p><p>
    
    And so the rest of the album goes, excising the weak and awkward bits that marred his other records. T.I.'s confidence seems effortless and second-nature, his self-aggrandizement turning relentless and convincing. If anything has been lost in his metamorphosis into aristocratically vicious Machiavellian monarch, it's his uncertainty, the touchingly awkward humility that crept into his voice when he begged neglected kids for forgiveness on <em>Trap Muzik</em>'s ""I Still Luv You"".</p><p>
    
    But that stuff had to go-- as did the ugly bursts of misogyny that would occasionally surface. When he talks to women now, he's conversational and courtly.  On ""Why You Wanna"", he leans over the languid house pianos from Crystal Waters' ""Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)"": ""What, he think he too fresh to show you that you're the best?/ Compliment you on ya intellect and treat you with respect?"" On ""Goodlife"", he pulls off two miracles at once: making the Neptunes' recent schmaltzy Vegas-lounge glide sound good (not even Jay-Z managed that too often) and beating guest Common at his own fondly melancholy nostalgia game: ""I was born into poverty, raised in the sewage/ Streets will always be a part of me; they made me the truest."" And on ""I'm Straight"" he's right at home on, lazily bragging over lilting 1970s-soul flutes and wispy guitar twirls, next to a hard, greasy B.G., and a gasping, larger-than-life Jeezy. Even the album's most glaring misstep, the weak r&amp;b; track ""Hello"", finds T.I. talking warmly to the girl who left him, which is nice. He can do that. He doesn't have to prove anything anymore.</p></div>"|8319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8319-king/|8.4|Tom Breihan

I Don't Want It Anymore/Yours 4-Ever Nicolai Dunger</em> (which gives Fiona Apple's <em>When the Pawn...</em> a run for its money and still comes up 80 words short), he teamed up with Mercury Rev. For someone who has pinned his musical identity to so many others, it's impressive that these collaborations are so naturally balanced that each resulting album sounds distinct but still like the work of Nicolai Dunger; each is a point on a steady line, with no illogical jumps in between. </i></p><p>
    
    Mercury Rev, who also co-produced <em>Here's My Song</em>, create baroque pastoral settings for Dunger's songs, reminiscent of their own albums but less otherworldly. Gentle guitar lines weep over a stone-stepping piano melody on ""Country Lane"", and an organ thrums suggestively on the eight-minute ""The Year of Love and Hurt Cycle"". Tambourines, spoons, and ragtag percussion jangle rustically on ""Way Up High"", while a regiment of horns storm in and out theatrically, interrupted by a doo-wop break. More inventive than Soundtrack of Our Lives and less chillily austere than Oldham, Mercury Rev prove to be his most dynamic partners, framing his songs but never infringing on them.</p><p>
    
    Dunger always remains in the foreground, but with that malleable voice, how could he not? As a vocalist, Dunger is most often compared to Van Morrison or Jeff Buckley, but here his songwriting and singing are obviously patterned on American soul music, suggesting vocalists like Al Green or Sam Moore. He sounds more purposeful in his performance: projecting on ""My Time Is Now"" and ""The Year of Love and Hurt Cycle"", pulling back for softer moments like ""White Wild Horses"" and ""Slaves (We're Together Like)"", and investing ""Hunger"" and ""Someone New"" with lusty commitment. Whether this sensitivity to the demands of the songs is practiced or intuitive-- or whether it's the result of singing more demanding material-- seems beside the point. Dunger creates enough drama to fill the stage Mercury Rev has set for him, his quiet vibrato like an aside to the audience.</p></div>"|11720.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11720-heres-my-song-you-can-have-iti-dont-want-it-anymoreyours-4-ever-nicolai-dunger/|7.6|Stephen M.

Their following has grown steadily in the almost 20 years since they began as a four-piece, psychedelic garage band, despite enduring countless lineup changes. In the meantime, they've leapfrogged from their own tiny label to various larger indies and finally to the majors, each time gaining wider exposure and more popularity. At this point their music can even be found in Japan's famous karaoke bars, allowing patrons to drunkenly experience their own version of the band's psychedelic freakouts.</p><p>
    
    Yet Yura Yura Teikoku have remained virtually unknown outside of their home land. While their concerts sell out in minutes in Japan, they've only played elsewhere a small handful of times. If the crowds at two N.Y. appearances in 2005 and the buzz since those performances are any indication, however, then it would seem that the band is poised to make a name for themselves stateside. After all, the U.S. underground has a history of adoring Japanese psych rock imports. But whereas Acid Mothers Temple and DMBQ utilize walls of noise and swirling instrumentation, Yura Yura Teikoku have streamlined their sound, creating psych-pop that can be quiet and sparse one moment and infectiously catchy the next.</p><p>
<em>Sweet Spot</em> begins with its longest track, ""2005 Nen Sakairyoko"", a minimalist exploration of bluesy psych-rock. Everything starts quietly, from the high-hat and rimshot beat to the plucky, reverbed guitar. Frontman Shintaro Sakamoto's distorted vocals are right up front, though, and as the track progresses, they are joined by the various hums and buzzes that threaten to smother the instruments to death. ""Robot Deshita"" is built almost entirely on a simple drum beat until tinkling piano and mechanical squeals segue into sci-fi noise about halfway through. </p><p>
    
    Yura Yura Teikoku's earlier records were much more grounded in garage rock, and there are still a few tracks here that hearken back to that earlier, more primal sound. ""Kyusyo"" is this album's noisiest, with guitars layered to dizzying effects. ""Hate Ningen Ha?"" borderlines on B-52's territory with its catchy, twangy guitar line, and falsetto whooing throughout the verses. But the majority of the record is atmospheric and reserved, giving the instruments plenty of room to do their own thing. The band's voice is unique, and despite borrowing from many American bands from the 1960s and 70s, it's impossible to simply label <em>Sweet Spot</em> as a Japanese version of American psych-rock. </p></div>"|8919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8919-sweet-spot/|7.0|Cory D.

However, the Esperonto ideal does hold true in one exceptional case: climactic, noise-heavy post-rock. It's the rare genre where you find bands from locations as far-flung as Iceland (Sigur Rós), Texas (Explosions in the Sky), Quebec (Godspeed You! Black Emperor), Scotland (Mogwai), and Japan (Mono) cultivating international fanbases by doing pretty much the same thing: being very quiet, then being very loud (preferably, over the course of 15 minute songs). And though all of these bands deal in mostly instrumental terms, the extremities in which they operate rarely leave room for interpretation-- Sigur Rós even went so far as to spell it out for you on their T-shirts: ""Avoid apocalypse, buy hope."" But the question posed by Mono's fifth album is, how much hope can you buy before you max out your credit?</p><p>
    There's a conservatory-like studiousness to <em>You Are There</em>, each dramatic device and solemn guitar melody introduced with such delicate, resolute deliberation, you can practically hear the quartet flipping their sheet-music pages. Steve Albini's cavernous recordings lend the material an air of fear and uncertainty, but for all the reverberating guitar lines, thunderous timpani marches, and ungodly distortion piled upon each track, the songs only have two places to go: up and down-- sometimes at the exact same intervals. Both the 13-minute opener ""The Flames Beyond the Cold Mountain"" and the 15-minute ""Yearning"" begin as uniformly desolate, funereal elegies before hitting their seismic crash-endos around the seven-minute mark and lingering until every last ember has flamed out.</p><p>
    Mono's fuzz-pedal fireworks are impressive in their sheer volume and vigor, but there's rarely the sense the music is ever going to fall apart, steer off the rails, or even change pace; these emotional roller coasters stay within the legal speed limit and come with extra-secure seatbelts. Only closer ""Moonlight"" (also a 13-minute commitment) betrays any signs of loosening, with a limbering space-rock sway that climbs up the back half of Pink Floyd's ""Echoes"". Mono are generous enough to offset <em>You Are There</em>'s four colossal tracks with a pair of serene, three-minute pieces (the glockenspieled lullaby ""A Heart Has Asked for the Pleasure"" and the string-sweetened piano pastorale ""The Remains of the Day""), and even if these brief respites work better as bathroom breaks than stand-along songs, they're ultimately necessary: after an hour of getting your heartstrings tugged with such intense proficiency, <em>You Are There</em> starts to feel no less egregiously manipulative than hearing Celine belt out ""My Heart Will Go On"" for the thousandth time in a Vegas ballroom.</p></div>"|5402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5402-you-are-there/|5.8|Stuart Berman

If the words evoke Morrissey's dual personae as myth and mythmaker, their religious overtones are a subtle reminder that he's also a never-quite-recovering Catholic. Though his 1990s relocation to Los Angeles, the sunny center of 20th century glamour, elicited little surprise, his recent move to Rome seems even more natural: There, the Pope of Mope can reel around the fountain of both Occidental culture and inexpiable guilt.</p><p>
    
    From humdrum towns to giddy London, from Sunset Boulevard to the Eternal City, this living sign signifies, first and foremost, himself. <em>Ringleader of the Tormentors</em> is a new Morrissey album, not a new Morrissey; attempts to wring autobiographical revelations from its lyrics are easy, but ultimately futile. Accusations of self-parody, after losing their sting sometime around ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"", remain apt but, in Morrissey's case, often irrelevant. On his eighth solo album, the enigmatic warbler again sounds contradictory notes on love, death, the divine, and the despised. All that's really changed are his collaborators-- Ennio Morricone, T. Rex/Bowie producer Tony Visconti, guitarist/co-songwriter Jesse Tobias-- who trade the televised-car-chase production of 2004 comeback <em>You Are The Quarry</em> for a sound more akin to the glam-rock crunch of <em>Your Arsenal</em>.</p><p>
    
    Rapturous self-torment-- particularly the chasm between love's possibility and its unrealized fulfillment-- was always the defining condition of the Morrissey experience. For Morrissey's narrators, love and death are two levels of the same double-decker bus-- a theme made explicit on lead single ""You Have Killed Me"", a strapping rocker reminiscent of ""Irish Blood, English Heart"". With Hammond organ syncope and Morricone strings, trembling ballad ""Dear God, Please Help Me"" likens lust to ""explosive kegs between my legs,"" while decorous torch song ""I'll Never Be Anyone's Hero Now"" places ""my one true love...under the ground."" As Moz idol Oscar Wilde put it, ""Each man kills the thing he loves."" Moz's interests were eloquently foreshadowed by another Catholic artist, Jean Genet, whose 1943 novel <em>Our Lady of the Flowers</em> laces its gay protagonist's exaltation of a beautiful male murderer with references to the Church. Likewise, Mel Gibson's 2004 <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> isn't <em>just</em> about homoerotic S&amp;M.;</p><p>
    
    The famous mind/body dichotomy from ""Still Ill"" tellingly neglects the soul, but Morrissey still can't escape what he's called ""inbuilt guilt."" Even ""Dear God, Please Help Me"", Moz's most emotionally beguiling song in years, grows ambivalent at the moment inattentive critics have cited as the singer's coming-out: When Morrissey sings, ""Dear God, did this kind of thing happen to you?/ Now I'm spreading your legs/ With mine in between/ Dear God, if I could I would help you,"" is he addressing a lover, or a loving deity? On ""You Have Killed Me"", which contains some of this infamous celibate's most candidly sexual lines since <em>Meat Is Murder</em>-era B-side ""Stretch Out and Wait"" (or at least <em>YATQ</em>'s ""Come Back to
    Camden""), the man who ostentatiously forgave Jesus two years ago ""for all the desire He placed in me"" slyly concludes, ""There is no point saying this again/ But I forgive you.""</p><p>
    
    Even when contemplating mortality, Morrissey remains enamored of youth. A children's choir guests on multiple tracks, including fast-paced single candidate ""The Youngest Was the Most Loved"". Their immature voices bestow hair-raising pathos upon a refrain almost too self-evidently jejune for the middle-aged Moz to sing alone: ""There is no such thing in life as normal."" The choir returns for ""The Father Who Must Be Killed"", an equally energetic knife-attack on a stern stepfather, which ends in eerie laughter. Elsewhere, Morrissey marks the passing of time more keenly, with even more overt auto-plagiarisms. ""It's the same old S.O.S.,"" he concedes amid the Roman rain, midtempo groove, and orchestral crescendos of the epic ""Life Is a Pigsty"". ""Even now in the final hour of my life/ I'm falling in love again,"" he adds, subtly acknowledging that love is not as new to his music as recent press has implied.</p><p>
    
    Morrissey's poignancy, in his best solo work as in his vivid Smiths prime-- what critic Simon Reynolds once called ""a piercing beauty, or a sweet ache""-- often inflames the exhilarating terror of loneliness just as it elevates the sensations of love through comparison with
    Moz's unrequitable romantic perfections. The complicated gender roles, the ubiquitous allusions, the games of irony, art, and style serve equally to ignite a listener's curiosity. <em>Ringleader of the Tormentors</em> is, rather than the now-anticipated letdown, another fitting heir to that legacy. The living sign again: ""This one is different, because it's us.""</p></div>"|5439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5439-ringleader-of-the-tormentors/|8.0|Marc Hogan

It's usually not quite clear what hip-hop <i>is if it doesn't include this stuff; it's a subculture always reacting and almost never acting. </i><i>Things Go Better With RJ and Al, the second album from the Columbus, Ohio duo of rapper Blueprint and producer Rjd2, starts out doing the worst thing an indie-rap album can do: furiously declaiming itself as being firmly and militantly on the indie side of the divide: ""No slogans, no 20-inch rims rolling/ No gold fronts, no publicity stunts."" The song, ""No Gimmicks"", is clumsy, reductive, and hookless. On the next song, Blueprint is still saying the same stuff: ""Rap nowadays is by a bunch of ignorant cats/ No 'Young, Gifted and Black', just guns, bitches, and crack.""</i></p><p>
    
    So if this guy is so firmly devoted to the cause of real hip-hop that he'll spend the first two songs on his album bitching about the state of rap, the question becomes what, exactly, Blueprint thinks is real hip-hop. Judging by the rest of the album, Blueprint thinks hip-hop means Will Smithian joke-raps about hooking up with ugly girls when he's drunk or fools using up his cell-phone minutes. This should probably go without saying, but if you're going to insist that you represent the true heart of an art-form, it might be a good idea to actually have something to say.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, though, Blueprint is pretty good at this joke-rap stuff, and once he gets the bluster out of his system, he's a lot of fun, kicking good-natured punchlines and riding beats with affable warmth. And lucky for him, Rjd2 is just about the best producer in indie-rap, and his gooey classicist strut-funk has none of the exhausted emptiness that it did the last time he produced an entire album, Aceyalone's <em>Magnificent City</em>. ""I'm Free"" comes with a great hard-swinging horn riff and a biting funk-guitar sample, while ""Drugs, Sex, Alcohol, Rock-n-Roll"" builds on a nice distorted bass-stomp and 1970s flute-flecks before finally turning into an instrumental breakdown that sounds like vintage Blue Cheer.</p><p>
    
    Seeming short at 40 minutes, it's a slight album, and it's marred by Blueprint's slavish devotion to his own goofy song-concepts, like ""I'm Free"", which uses the word ""free"" on every line. Blueprint also has a tough time with hooks (he usually just repeats a couple of words over and over and hopes that it suffices) and a troubling streak of churlishness, advising young women to never have sex on ""The Cool Thing to Do"" and telling the story of a girl who gets molested and ends up becoming a lesbian on ""Drugs, Sex, Alcohol, Rock-n-Roll"". But at least he resists the temptation of pointing out that ""Keys"" is about the little metal things that open doors.</p></div>"|7370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7370-things-go-better-with-rj-and-al/|6.3|Tom Breihan

After punk and new wave, DIY experimentation, electronic music, and a healthy cross-breeding of scenes via all manner of unlikely collaborations and manifestos-- playing six degrees of separation with musicians from the late-70s and early-80s could easily make bedfellows of a pop star and a no wave anti-celebrity-- bands who might've been content to play just prog or free improvisation or deranged blues began throwing everything into a blender and skronking out whatever they could. Predating today's noise-rock scene-- and earlier acts like Boredoms, Ruins and John Zorn's Naked City-- the first wave of 80s experimental rock musicians had few precedents for their brand of noise, but they did have the ability to choose amongst a huge variety of source material to integrate into their cacophonous attack plans. Heads of the class were This Heat, Material, the Work, Ornette Coleman's Prime Time, James Blood Ulmer, Last Exit, and the international trio Massacre.</p><p>
    
    Massacre formed in New York City in 1980, after British guitarist Fred Frith had moved there following the demise of his former band, Henry Cow. After hooking up with Material bassist Bill Laswell and drummer Fred Maher, the band recorded a single record in 1981 before disbanding. And they totally killed it: The tunes on <em>Killing Time</em> represent one of the greatest possible ends for the concept of a power trio circa early-80s downtown NYC. Taking hints from no wave, Massacre's music had a generally chaotic, breakneck pace, focusing each member's considerable musical abilities on jagged, squealing ""melodies"" and an angular yet blurred attack. Some of the music sounds improvised (reminiscent of earlier Henry Cow live stuff, or even mid-70s King Crimson), but the pulse never wavers; momentum never falls below a menacing rumble.</p><p>
    
    ""Legs"" is a hybrid of early Devo and <em>Discipline</em>-era Crimson, with atonal guitar lines, pointed phrasing and that unmistakable proto-dancepunk pogo beat. Laswell's rubber band punch underneath the head makes an already feverish tune seem all the more ready to burst, and when ""Aging With Dignity Takes Over"", the trio dives headfirst into apocalypse-beat. Frith sounds like Derek Bailey gone punk, and the primal drums and Laswell's strings being abused are certainly in keeping with the aggressive, primitivist aesthetic. Perhaps that's the strangest thing about Massacre: They sounded as immediate and unsettled as a no wave act, but played everything like rabid musos.</p><p>
    
    The title track blows everything out of the water, again hitting the hi-speed beats and ultra-dissonant guitar leads, sounding like submarine chase music-- paranoid and destroying anything in its path. ReR's reissue adds several live bonus tracks, including dark ambient pieces like ""You Said"", ""Carrying"", and ""Know"" that predate Frith's Death Ambient project of the 1990s. Conversely, ""F.B.I."" is something of a metal cowboy song, and reminds me of tracks on the first Naked City record where the band would start out playing a fake television theme only to erupt in splatter noise at seemingly random intervals.</p><p>
    
    Suffice to say, Massacre are not for the faint (or musically conservative) at heart. After a long layoff, the band did regroup in the late-90s, though working with ex-This Heat drummer Charles Hayward instead of Mayer. The results were interesting, but to my ears, they never matched the focused intensity of <i>Killing Time. Nevertheless, this record belongs in a pretty select group of great, instrumental avant-rock albums, and is one that should find a fan in anyone who doesn't mind a few shards of broken glass mixed in amongst their riffs.</i></p></div>"|5684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5684-killing-time/|8.2|Dominique Leone

    to the Sound Dimension, among the lead authors of one of popular music's greatest chapters. 
    The Sound Dimension reshaped the signature Jamaican afterbeat of ska and rocksteady into the 
    sturdy, versatile riddims of reggae, and the instrumentals they created are 
    still being used as the basis of scores of songs to this day. The 
    early days of reggae, the late-60s, saw the birth of the first remix 
    culture, where the basic rhythmic backing tracks of popular vocal hits were 
    given lives of their own, often with the vocals replaced by instrumental 
    solos or keyboard experiments.</p><p>
    
    The Sound Dimension were the house band at Coxsone Dodd's Studio One, and 
    much like Motown's Funk Brothers, they backed dozens of singers on hundreds 
    of hits in their few years together. Unlike the Funk Brothers, though, they 
    were also a widely acknowledged outfit in their own right, with singles 
    bearing their name and a corresponding place in the public eye. The group 
    essentially evolved from the Skatalites after that band imploded following 
    the murder conviction of trombonist and guiding force Don Drummond. 
    Originally known as the Soul Vendors, they changed their name after 
    returning from a UK tour, rechristening themselves after an echo unit Dodd 
    had purchased in England. You can hear that very unit on the guitar, 
    answering each upstroke on songs like ""Doctor Sappa Too"" with an offset 
    response, an afterbeat after the afterbeat.</p><p>
    
    Soul Jazz's tracklisting leaves out most of the band's best-known tracks 
    like ""Real Rock"", most of which are available on Heartbeat's <em>Downbeat the Ruler</em> compilation. Instead it mixes a few high-profile songs with a ton of cuts that had previously been available only in Jamaica. It's a funky disc, 
    full of great, skanking rhythms and fine playing by some of Jamaica's most 
    revered musicians, including Leroy Sibbles, Cedric Brooks, Jackie Mittoo 
    (barely in his twenties at the time and already a seasoned vet), Ernest 
    Ranglin, Rolando Alphonso, and Vin Gordon. The jazz upbringing and training 
    of many of those musicians is apparent in the lyricism of the saxophone and 
    trombone leads, while ""Love Land"" and ""Soul Shake"" nod to 
    traditional Rastafarian music with the inclusion of burru hand-drumming, 
    similar in rhythmic style to the hand-drumming of Senegal's mbalax music.</p><p>
    
    Mittoo was one of the band's leaders, and his unique keyboard 
    style is a major part of the music's appeal. Mittoo uses bright, unaffected 
    organ tones, and his playing has a melodic meander to it that cuts nicely 
    through the tight horn arrangements and frequently wah'd-out guitars. The 
    best songs tend to have the most fully fleshed arrangements, with thick horn 
    sections and great leads, like the classics ""Heavy Beat"" and ""Full Up"". You 
    might recognize ""Upsetters Dream"" as the backing track of Carlton &amp; the 
    Shoes' ""Love Me Forever"", but it sounds quite good on its own, with a 
    beautifully understated wah guitar lead from Ernest Ranglin.</p><p>
    
    A bit of early toasting shows up on a couple of later tracks, ""Holy Moses"" 
    and ""Hail Don D"" (a reference to Drummond), but it adds little, as it hadn't developed to the point it would in dancehall and dub. There are a couple of songs that feel like they're missing something-- samples waiting to happen, essentially, and it's easy to see why these tracks are versioned so often, as the rhythms are all rock solid and the chord changes aren't too out of the ordinary, meaning you can go in a lot of different directions from the source.</p><p>
    
    It's refreshing to see the Sound Dimension achieving recognition in their 
    own right for their huge contribution to reggae. More to the point, though, 
    it's clear from this release that they were more than just a backing band, 
    and that the music they made stands well on its own, albeit usually with an 
    overdub or two. Hearing this music in relation to the hits by Alton Ellis, 
    Jon Holt, Dennis Brown, Bob Andy, Slim Smith, Don Evans, and others whose backbones these tracks formed is hugely entertaining as well, though 
    you'll have to track down those songs on your own. If you're attached to 
    those vocalists or Jamaican singing styles generally, then you may find this disc a little lacking, but if you're looking for a deeper understanding of reggae and where it came from, this will help you find it.</p></div>"|7851.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7851-soul-jamaica-shake-vol-1/|7.9|Joe Tangari

Robinson's is a quirky legacy. He's just as likely to lovingly spoon-feed you sugary pop as he is to make you take your medicine in the form of uncompromising sonic experiments. Look no further than the shrill, sustained tone of ""Volume Reference Control"", which introduces Unrest's <em>Imperial f.f.r.r.</em>, for an example of Robinson's penchant for noise (and, apparently, tormenting dogs).</p><p>
    
    On <em>Dixie</em>, Flin Flon's third album since forming in 1997, the band appears to be heading down the same road. To fulfill the experimental quota, the record is book-ended by two punishingly hyperactive drum solos, ""Cavendish"" and ""Capstick"", courtesy of drummer Matt Datesman. It's a screwball way to begin and end an album, but it immediately ushers you into the world of Flin Flon-- which hasn't changed much since the last visit. The band still sounds like some precisely engineered machine: slick and polished, but somehow sterile. Datesman's rumbling drums and Nattles' ubiquitous bass create an airless backdrop for Robinson's single-note guitar spikes and chiming chords. Flin Flon are always tight, but these songs are almost choked to death as the band seldom shifts tempo or uses silence or space to add depth to the compositions. One exception is ""Trafalgar"", which opens with Robinson's brittle, ringing guitar and a more subdued bass line from Nattles.  By the time Datesman's percussion enters, it's playing a supporting role instead of indulging in a free-for-all of non-stop fills.</p><p>
    
    In another peculiar decision, <em>Dixie's drum solos are followed and preceded by alternate versions of the same song, ""Cardigan"". It's probably the album's standout, but even ""Stairway to Heaven"" only appears on one side of </em><em>Led Zeppelin IV</em>. On ""Cardigan"", Robinson gives us a dose of his oblique lyrics, relying on suggestion rather than anything concrete to describe a rocky relationship: ""Rip, torn/ Nice sweater/ Nice fabric/ Nice way to create a distraction."" It's an approach that has long served him well and is suited to the music's sharp edges.</p><p>
    
    The aspiring geographers among Pitchfork's readership may have noticed that every song title mentioned from <em>Dixie</em> refers to a place in Nova Scotia-- or that the band's name itself is a city in Manitoba (""a picturesque mining community and tourist paradise"" boasts the city's website). While Robinson's obsession with Canadian place names is pretty weird, it's also an interesting way to think about Flin Flon's music. Like a cartographer who leaves no location on a map unnamed, Flin Flon sticks to familiar territory on <em>Dixie, never truly exploring its sound or venturing into the unknown.</em></p></div>"|3104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3104-dixie/|6.5|John Motley

The arrival of their debut album on Devendra Banhart and Andy Cabic's Gnomonsong label has not gone unheralded, since the group have built a promising reputation through their guest appearances on Banhart's <em>Cripple Crow</em> and opening for such acts as Sufjan Stevens, Dinosaur Jr., and Smog. In addition, Feathers' Kyle Thomas and Asa Irons perform alongside J Mascis in the sweet-leaf metal combo Witch, an outfit whose recent debut provides this ethereal album with a valuable textual counterpoint.</p><p>
    
    Home recorded and originally self-released on vinyl, the music on <em>Feathers</em> exists largely in the bucolic countryside previously occupied by the Incredible String Band, Comus and their progressive brethren. This might lead skeptics to dismiss this spirited collective as just another escapist hippie revival. Yet throughout the album the casual sophistication of Feathers' arrangements-- as well as their firm grasp of dissolute, post-Siltbreeze dynamics-- helps these performances achieve a distinct emotive depth and a gauzy, out-of-time luster. Four of the group's eight members contributed to the songwriting, and at least that many help furnish vocals. And while this multiplicity of perspective lends the album a constant variety of shade and nuance, it never distracts from the essential fellowship of Feathers' quiet, communal flutter.</p><p>
    
    The surprising elegence of the group's vocal interplay is evident almost immediately in the opening minutes of ""Old Black Hat With a Dandelion Flower"". Layered with ripples of acoustic and electric guitar above exotic percussion that curiously recalls Dr. John's 1968 voodoo-psych classic <em>Gris Gris</em>, this track is resplendent with the easy vocal harmonies of Meara O'Reilly and Ruth Garbus, with Kurt Weisman's falsetto adding a sweetly off-kilter wobble to the gentle din. Later on, relatively forthright folk-rock songs like ""To Each His Own"" and ""Past the Moon"" are enlivened through Feathers' deft instrumental flourishes, as discrete elements of cello, mandolin, lap-harp and birdcalls are inserted between their mirrored rays of quicksilver guitar.</p><p>
    
    Affairs become slightly more unhinged on ""Van Rat"", an oddball structure of whistles, stray radio waves and inscrutable lyrics that reference monkeys and robot arms. As is the case with Witch, here Feathers' persistently ornate and hard-to-decipher lyrics are delivered without a trace of irony. This earnestness can give seemingly fanciful tracks like ""Silverleaves in the Air of Starseedlings"" an unsettling, vaguely sinister undertow, an effect further amplified on ""Ibex Horn"" by a mixed chorus of shadowy whispers. The clouds part, however, on the guileless anthem ""Come Around"", an irresistable call to nature that carries the album off with a spring-like gust of extra-potent oxygen. Coupling their graceful, intuitive musicianship with a resolute outward-bound gaze, Feathers appear ready to join the elite of the avant-folk underground, and ideally this will be the first of many passages through their peaceable, separatist kingdom.</p></div>"|3364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3364-feathers/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

With only his strumming to accompany him, Wayne sings, ""Cats killing dogs, pigs eating rats..."" The song is ""Psychiatric Explorations of the Fetus With Needles"", and on its way to actualization, it will acquire a weird intro and a stranger instrumental bridge, and will be puffed up large and colorful enough to suit the rest of that big, glowing album. But even as Coyne plays it alone on guitar, you can hear something special.</p><p>
    Listening to <em>At War With the Mystics</em>-- the Flaming Lips' first new album in almost four years, and the product of many months in the studio-- it's difficult to imagine a similarly inspiring glimpse into one of these songs' construction. Much of the record sounds like chords and melodies were written later, as an afterthought to flesh out production experiments. The goofy noises, glitches, and wafts of Wilsonian harmony in ""Haven't Got a Clue"", for example, seem to be more central to the track's focus than the melody (of which there is almost none) or the lyrics (""Every time you state your case/ The more I want to punch your face""). But the sounds are certainly interesting.</p><p>
<em>At War With the Mystics</em> has already been discussed as the band's Return to Rock or Return to the Weird, but I don't really hear those things. Some of this talk arose because among the first of these tracks to emerge was ""The W.A.N.D."", a good song built on a gnarly guitar riff-- a combo we haven't heard from these guys for some time. It doesn't approach the force of, say, ""Slow Nerve Action"", but this is the best guitar rock they've produced since <em>Clouds Taste Metallic</em>. Still, it's not indicative of the record as a whole.</p><p>
    Instead, <em>At War With the Mystics</em> is a grab bag of musical styles, without ever seeming like a retread of any particular album or sound they've explored during the course of their 20-year career. Though the themes are cut from the same cloth as the last few records-- meditations on fear, death, love, one's place in the universe, and so on-- musically, the band is up for experimenting. The production is distant, queasy, fuzzier, and less direct than any of their recent outings; the vocals are often manipulated and toyed with-- Coyne goes from singing in a register so low you can hardly recognize him (the single ""Yeah Yeah Yeah Song"") to one so high that he sounds like Beck doing Prince (""Free Radicals""). Musical mastermind Steven Drozd even sings his first lead, on ""Pompeii Am Götterdämmerung"", one of the record's better songs, a peculiar amalgamation of several strands of krautrock and Pink Floyd's ""One of These Days"".</p><p>
    While the band has always played around with a variety of sounds, when you get down to the nuts and bolts of songwriting, most of <em>Mystics</em> doesn't measure up. It's telling that their best melody since <em>The Soft Bulletin</em> was written by Cat Stevens, and when the Lips make more traditional song compositions their focus, the results here are rarely engaging. <i>At War With the Mystics</i> leaves me wondering whether making good records is really the point for the Flaming Lips at this juncture. With this album, I'm struck by the possibility that the Flaming Lips are an idea and a project as much of a band, and records are just one of the organization's many concerns. This doesn't seem like any great tragedy, and I've no question that many tens of thousands more people will get into them this year for the first time and find their lives enriched by what the Flaming Lips have to offer. But for the first time in more than 15 years they've made an album that is difficult to consider great, regardless of how it's approached.</p></div>"|3086.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3086-at-war-with-the-mystics/|6.7|Mark Richardson

    would you call it the third time around? Around these parts, the Vines 
    have been a farce from the start-- adding up the numbers Pitchfork 
    writers attached to their first two albums would barely get them past 6. Well, here are some points to get these sassy kids over the 
    ever-loving ten point oh mark. If these three albums get released on 
    one CD, it will be so awesome.</p><p>
    
    As it stands, what the Vines offer on their third album is permutations 
    and refinements on what they've been doing since whenever. On the 
    stupid loud songs, Craig Nicholls sounds like a bored Kurt Cobain. On 
    the stupid slow songs, Craig Nicholls sounds like a bored Liam Gallagher 
    (which is pretty impressive, given Gallagher's innate inertia). To the 
    group's benefit, the exhibitions of ennui available on <em>Vision 
    Valley</em> cut out before the 3:00 mark. (That excludes 
    ""Spaceship"", the group's six-minute Pink Floyd Stadium Tour moment.) A 
    lot of tracks barely make it past two minutes, which works great for the 
    hyper-ironic first single, ""Don't Listen to the Radio"", and ""Nothin's 
    Comin'"", one of the better Nirvanabee tracks. Brevity does not help 
    when you call a song ""Futuretarded""-- cowbell or no cowbell.</p><p>
    
    Of course, track length is immaterial when your trippy dippy 
    psych-psoaked buzz ballads are wearing out their welcome before they 
    find that confounded bridge. ""Take Me Back"" is country-fried Vines, 
    complete with twangy guitar lead-in. ""Going Gone"" is wonderwalled 
    Vines, complete with string section. And if one's source of inspiration 
    is the overworn ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" (as it is on the title 
    track), then one needs to go back to the drawing board and chuck the 
    tracing paper.</p><p>
    
    And that's the short of it. This album's greatest failing is that 
    there's nothing here. There's nothing remotely offensive about 
    <em>Vision Valley</em> that can inspire any sort of righteous fury about 
    the musical hegemony. Unless you're offended by the f-bomb-- there are 
    bits of f-shrapnel sprinkled throughout, to provisionally lend 
    proceedings a certain edge that no amount of power chording can truly 
    hone. And there's nothing musically offputting about this record, 
    unless relentless mediocrity in the three-chord arts is a capital crime.</p><p>
    
    Subjectivity being what it is-- the Vines are the Vines are the Vines. 
    They're good at what they do, even if what they do isn't all that good. They have their fan base. They have inroads to get a song into some commercial and on Jack FM stations. They have a budget to make videos that will get them face time on MTV2's Subterranean. And, in two years, 
    they'll have another album out that (if previous efforts are any 
    indication) will sound a lot like this one. Maybe they'll tap into some 
    unforeseen creative vein and surprise everyone with their Brave New 
    Direction, or actually write more than one or two decent songs per 
    album. Until that happens, though, you know what you're getting if 
    you're buying this album. And you're probably not going to like it.</p></div>"|8473.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8473-vision-valley/|3.4|David Raposa

    Aheluchatistas' third album. While I can't remember Donald Rumsfeld 
    physically at Abu Ghraib, I get the message-- he was there in essence as a 
    guiding force. And with that, another 
    Ahleuchatistas album is off and running like a dog with five legs, the 
    rhythms weird and asymmetrical, cropping up in meters nearly impossible to 
    keep track of, and rarely simple or familiar.</p><p>
<em>What You Will</em> doesn't put a lot of stylistic distance between itself and the 
    Asheville, N.C., trio's two previous albums, but on several tracks it 
    displays a boost in compositional maturity. The tension and release feel 
    more organic, and though jarring jump-cuts are still 
    plentiful, there's often more of a sense of purposeful contrast. On 
    ""Remember Rumsfeld"", dig the way Shane Perlowin's stridently 
    unaffected electric guitar sticks stubbornly to those slow, mournful figures 
    even as the bass and drums egg it on with frenzied outbursts. Each note quivers into adjacent quarter tones, and when the band 
    finally coalesces, it heads off on a martially unified path of mayhem.</p><p>
    It's weird to hear a contemporary band stick so militantly to the basics, relying 
    on guitar, bass, and drums without distortion or an overdub. ""Ho Chi Minh Is Gonna Win!"" opens with a mind-blowing patch of 
    groove, with palm-muted guitar hitching a ride on Derek Poteat's burbling, 
    almost Chris Squire-ish bass, and then streaks off on a series of wild 
    tangents á la King Crimson's ""Great Deceiver"". Toward the middle, drummer 
    Sean Dail settles on a simmering ride cymbal pattern, which Perlowin coats 
    with chiming guitar, creating the prettiest moment Ahleuchatistas have put 
    on tape to date.</p><p>
    The band operates in pretty unforgiving territory, and naturally not 
    everything works. ""Sometimes There's a Buggy"" gets bogged down in a repetitive midsection and has little sense of structure. The track feels like it has the seeds of several other, more interesting 
    songs in it, but it never blossoms itself. The music suffers at other points from a <em>lack</em> of repetition-- a phrase flees too quickly or a passage 
    doesn't return. ""Shell in Ogoniland"" has an especially bad 
    attention deficit, stabbing in about 18 directions at once.</p><p>
    Thankfully, most of the songs come together as they should-- ""Maybe Orange"" 
    switches deftly between tension-building passages and bursts of off-center 
    groove, while ""Sherman's March"" assembles itself from dystopian chaos into 
    the most straightforwardly brutal rhythm the band has hit on yet. What the 
    band's success comes down to, though, is that they're astonishingly together 
    even on passages where it seems downright impossible to stay in sync. You 
    don't get the impression that they're virtuosos or even trying to be, just 
    that they're a very single-minded entity. Playing instrumental rock with a 
    setup this basic, that single-mindedness is essential.</p></div>"|433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/433-what-you-will/|7.6|Joe Tangari

    when the Essex Green last invoked that era's blithe folk-rock. Apparently the band noticed,
    too: On <em>Cannibal Sea</em>, the
    Brooklyn-via-Vermont Elephant 6 progeny who once insisted, ""I'll see
    you in the '60s,"" come to terms with Rupert-Murdoch's-MySpace era,
    though without straying too far from their cherished influences.
    They're still cheery and hook-laden, although-- apropos of the times-- a
    little less innocent, a little less free.</p><p>
    Where previous albums wore the same sepia patina of nostalgia cast by labelmates the Clientele, <em>Cannibal Sea</em>'s most immediate track, ""Don't Know Why (You
    Stay)"", sparkles with new wave synths and itchy electric-guitar
    palm-mutes; Chris Ziter's lilting, faintly geeky vocals steering the
    tune toward the New Pornos more than the Cars. Ziter's harmonies with
    Sasha Bell are the most affecting moments on song and album alike.
    They're equally essential on Bell-fronted freshmaker ""Elsinore"", while
    ""Penny &amp; Jack"" does windswept mid-80s British. These here are
    streamlined pop machines; they take few chances but always do
    the job.</p><p>
    Sure, presentation's more Now, but the compositions still hearken
    the usual back-in-the-day way. Opener ""This Isn't Farm Life"" shoots a
    Motown charge into either/both the Kinks' ""Victoria"" or Belle &amp;
    Sebastian's ""Like Dylan in the Movies"", as Bell tosses off lines about
    the <em>Iliad</em> in her deceptively plainspoken voice. ""Snakes in the
    Grass"", complete with well-timed rattles, borrows the powwow stomp of
    Paul Revere and the Raiders' ""Indian Reservation"", amid
    <em>Revolver</em>-flanged vocal responses that represent one of the
    disc's too-rare nods toward the band's vaguely psychedelic history.
    Ziter sounds like an actually singing-enabled Ringo amid the seaworthy
    acoustic guitars of ""The Pride"".</p><p>
    By the end, it's 40 minutes later, you've been to a wintry ""Sin City""
    that's actually just Ohio, run down the ""Rue de Lis"" like Paul Simon
    singing ""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright"" to ""Homeward Bound"", and gone all
    <em>Watership Down</em> English folk for ""Rabbit"". The difference, as
    between fellow Merge band the Rosebuds' debut and sophomore albums, is
    a greater engagement with the prevailing indiepop aesthetic
    rather than long-dead flower-cliché epochs, though without quite the
    songwriting chops of Bell and guitarist Jeff Baron's other band,
    Ladybug Transistor.</p></div>"|2837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2837-cannibal-sea/|7.2|Marc Hogan

<p>It should presumably be no bombshell to suggest that a new Acid Mothers Temple album title might be something of a non sequitur.

This line-up of the Cosmic Inferno-- featuring the powerhouse rhythm section of ex-Zeni Geva bassist Tabata Mitsuru and dual drummers Shimura Koji and Okano Futoshi-- has the firepower to deliver such an extravaganza. Yet although there are accents of Sabbath lurking in the dank corners of the album's two extended tracks, Kawabata can't resist setting his controls for the furthest reaches of Ursa Minor, returning to the familiar acid rock regions encountered on 2002's <i>Electric Heavyland</i>.</p>
<p>As with many of AMT's recent works, <i>Starless and Bible Black Sabbath</i> is dominated by a single epic-length track. Here, on the 30+ minute title track, the Cosmic Inferno abandon the Gong-inspired stoner motorik of last year's <i>IAO Chant</i> in favor of a lumbering, grungy riff that sounds frustratingly spindly, and too lacking in bottom end to truly conjure Sabbath. At any rate, there's certainly little of Tony Iommi's foursquare influence audible in Makoto's continual soloing, as he spends nearly the entire length of the track furiously exploring his guitar's scorching upper limits. Though his virtuosity can be jawdropping in smaller doses, here his strenuous repetitions will likely prove a serious test for the sober listener's patience, as will Higashi Hiroshi's increasingly intrusive sci-fi keyboard effects. The spirited thrash of the following ""Woman From a Hell"" helps restore some visceral momentum, but does too little to entirely rescue <i>Starless and Bible Black Sabbath</i> from the province of missed opportunity.</p>
<p>More successful, and considerably more chaotic, is <i>We Are Acid Mothers Afrirampo</i>, recorded with the assistance of crazed female avant-garage duo Afrirampo. The hot-wired twosome of Oni and Pika have made cameos on previous Acid Mothers Temple records, and Makoto issued Afrirampo's first album on AMT's own label, but this is the first attempt at a full-length collaboration between the two groups. Using a damaged collection of percussion, toys, recorders and ecstatic vocals, Afrirampo inject these proceedings with their own distinctive brand of deranged garage rock and Fluxus-tinted bubblegum, while Makoto and crew work graciously to keep up.</p>
<p>The heavy-psych of the opening title track soon gives way to a prolonged breakdown of childlike vocal gibbering, before the guitars of Makoto and Oni again combine for some mutual post-No Wave jamming. ""The Exorcist of Love"" initially sounds like one of Acid Mothers Temple's pastoral folk interludes, but soon scurries away into loopy Joe Meek tape effects and slow-building electric crescendos. And ""The Man From the Magic Mountain"" combines all these various subjects to an extremely disorienting effect, as space-age electronics rub anxiously against plumes of violin and Afrirampo's savage human wails. Recalling everything from the Shaggs to early Red Krayola, the album yields most of its feral charms upon one or two careful listens, but does suitably translate what must have been an absolutely insane couple of hours in the recording studio. The scariest thought of all is that it sounds like Acid Mothers Temple and Afrirampo, if they so chose, could conceivably get together and record an album just like this every week. So if you plan to keep up, you had better start clearing your shelf space now.</p></div>"|11625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11625-starless-and-bible-black-sabbath-we-are-acid-mothers-afrirampo/|6.0|Matthew Murphy

Recalling everything from the Shaggs to early Red Krayola, the album yields most of its feral charms upon one or two careful listens, but does suitably translate what must have been an absolutely insane couple of hours in the recording studio. The scariest thought of all is that it sounds like Acid Mothers Temple and Afrirampo, if they so chose, could conceivably get together and record an album just like this every week. So if you plan to keep up, you had better start clearing your shelf space now.</p></div>"|11625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11625-starless-and-bible-black-sabbath-we-are-acid-mothers-afrirampo/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

    but there are some tires or drug habits you don't want to kick
    (just caffeine, Mom). So why does Stephin
    Merritt have to go and make a <em>Showtunes</em> album when everybody
    who didn't know Stephin Merritt liked showtunes has worse problems
    than rockism? And, while we're killing
    Santa and finding out where the falafel cart guy washes his hands
    post-pee, here's another obvious bliss-buster: Cool, jazzy pop dude
    Sondre Lerche likes cool, poppy jazz. I totally know!</p><p>
    Yup, the 23-year-old Norwegian kid whose delovely 2004 traipse <em>Two
    Way Monologue</em> taught you the difference between augmented and
    diminished chords <em>totally</em> digs him some Chet Baker-- not just
    the trumpet stuff, either. Backed, like Baker on his 1958 <em>Sings It
    Could Happen to You</em>, by a deft quartet, Lerche steps away on
    <em>Duper Sessions</em> from the mild psychedelia of his two
    all-original albums. Instead, with walking bass, and clean,
    close-miked production, he breezes through a smart smattering of new
    and standard material.</p><p>
    Lerche has always been something of a jazz-style
    interpreter. On previous albums, the frameworks for Lerche's
    skee-doo-doodling melodies also include Nick Drake and the Beach Boys,
    but great tunes sometimes get tripped up by incomprehensible lyrics
    (beats my Norwegian though). But despite solid backing here, he
    doesn't sing like Baker, let alone Frank Sinatra; his soft Ben Gibbard
    geekiness is an odd, if timely, fit for the swinging material, and
    flourishes of Jeff Buckley throat rattles don't help. His take on Cole
    Porter's ""Night and Day"" is as call-me-unexceptional as the take on
    Porter's ""The More I See You"" he funny valentined for a Starbucks comp
    alongside Madeleine Peyroux. A piano-led run on tourmate Elvis
    Costello's ""Human Hands"" doesn't go too Harry Connick, while a cover
    of likeminded English group Prefab Sprout's 1988 ""Nightingales"" slowly
    tinkles more like wind chimes than songbirds.</p><p>
    Fortunately, the best of Lerche's originals blend right in with-- and
    actually work better than-- the remakes. ""The Curse of Being in Love""
    starts with clean, lightly syncopated guitar as Lerche sings of the
    joy of new romance vs. the horror of mature love-- ""It won't get
    better""-- before a delightful, if not unexpected, closing turn.
    Descending piano plays as large a role as Lerche's voice on slow, dewy
    ""Minor Detail"", and the Flamingos-like doo-wop waltz ""You Sure Look
    Swell"" coaxes out the wine glasses almost as easily as Baker's
    classics. Still, for all the potential post-Norah Jones appeal of a
    record like <em>Duper Sessions</em>, it mostly just whets the appetite
    for Lerche's next album, where one hopes Baker-style standards will
    again serve merely as an ingredient, not the entrée. Who knows where
    this guy's hands have been? Merritt can keep doing showtunes, though.</p></div>"|4745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4745-duper-sessions/|6.1|Marc Hogan

And it's perhaps with this idea of cured preservation in mind that NYC's Mouthus present their fourth (or so) full-length album, <em>The Long Salt</em>. Using a brutish selection of electronics, busted guitar, percussion, and time-collapsed vocals, the duo of Brian Sullivan and Nate Nelson here sound as though they intend to stun their unsuspecting listeners then embalm them in a boggy avant-rock brine.</p><p>
    
    As with contemporaries like Hair Police or Sightings, Mouthus appear to simply enjoy rock dynamics too much to participate entirely in a faithless, full-scale deconstruction. Their 2005 Troubleman album <em>Slow Globes</em> was one of the most inspired free-rock artifacts of recent vintage, incorporating acoustic instruments and even a deranged interpretation of Fleetwood Mac's ""Storms"" into the duo's brutal yet microscopically attuned psychedelic mayhem. For their follow-up, however, Mouthus have thickened their tongues and dampened their precision, and the resulting work is embedded with some of their sludgiest, least navigable arrangements to date.</p><p>
    
    In addition to the release of <em>Slow Globes</em>, 2005 saw Nate and Brian collaborate with members of Double Leopards in the volcanic quartet White Rock. And the savage influence of the Leopards definitely seems to have rubbed off here on mulching, drone-heavy tracks like ""The Burns of Them"" or ""What Knife Say."" Carried by hyper-attenuated sheets of delayed vocals and outstretched electronics, ""The Burns of Them"" is as close as Mouthus have come to forsaking all rock-based propulsion, with Nelson's maltreated drum kit buried somewhere out back with a rag in its mouth. Elsewhere, however, ""WL"" reduces the post-punk formations of the Birthday Party or the Fall down to a raw skeleton of dangling nerves, filling the air with indecipherable jargon and concussive drumbeats that ring like pistol shots.</p><p> 
    
    Guest musician Samara Lubelski (Hall of Fame, Tower Recordings) adds molten strands of violin and vocal to the cyclonic hum of ""Ghetto Stairs"", while ""Ziggurats"" spins like a broken flywheel, studded with the sort of stray electronic particles that might be cast off by Whitehouse. Yet throughout their earth-eating frenzy, Mouthus' idiosyncratic but graspable rhythms and murky riffs seep in under the floorboards. Beneath its heavy curtain of Dead C-inspired distortion, ""What Knife Say"" courses with a surprisingly refined near-melodic grace, as Sullivan's garbled, impassioned vocal directives remain just a head above the music's choppy currents. And while <em>The Long Salt</em> might ultimately scan as little more than a lateral move away from the obscured peaks of <em>Slow Globes</em>, an occasional dip in its astringent waters should be enough to illustrate its cleansing and restorative powers.</p></div>"|5683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5683-the-long-salt/|7.3|Matthew Murphy

As this meme tips toward cliché, might a paradigm shift be on the horizon? It's too early to call 2006 the Year of the Horse, but if it proves true, then Band of Horses will be remembered as the band that defined ""horse"" music as opposed to ""wolf"" music. Putting aside the Superwolfs and Patrick Wolfs of the world, wolf music is malevolent; it darts and lunges, beady-eyed and razor-toothed. By contrast, horse music, as exemplified by Band of Horses, is noble and graceful, with the potential to restore to indie music an equilibrium reviled by conniving wolves. But this prospective equine aesthetic falters before it even breaks a trot: They Shoot Horses Don't They are wolves in horse's clothing. <em>Boo Hoo Hoo Boo</em> consistently subjugates the song to unconvincing primitivism.</p><p> 
    This Vancouver-based octet is one of those bands that can take a little bit of everything-- twitchy mariachi rhythms, bombastic klezmer horns, big-top pageantry and found-item drumlines, cabaret-punk vocals, and guitar-rock snippets-- and turn it into a whole lot of not much. <em>Boo Hoo Hoo Boo</em> is deliberately enervating and wolfishly provocative, but doesn't offer enough substance to compensate for the jangled nerves. TSHDT's ace in the hole is the brass section, which manages to be giddy, magisterial and catchy all at once, and the songs on which the horns take center-stage are the best of the bunch. On ""Lowlife"", they lean into a mighty swing sturdy enough to hold up the weight of the spleeny vocals, and on ""Apple"", they sear an imposing melody across what would otherwise be another tepid Birthday Party encomium.</p><p> 
    For a music with lyrics like ""I'm gonna form a new religion/ Living in the woods and eating bugs"", the album seems awfully civilized-- individual parts that aspire to a state of chaos fall in orderly rank and file, each clearly discernible, and no palpable sense of danger or abandon ever resolves. The broken typewriter rhythms and rubbery bass tones of ""Emptyhead"" have the potential to be compelling, but unfurl too rigidly to scan as more than vertices on a grid. The Mark-E.-Smith-as-drawling-cowboy mien of ""Three"" seems to strive toward corniness, and succeeds. But to what end? Intentionally corny is still corny. The woozy guitar gallop, squiggly horns, and incantatory vocals of ""Hiccup"" are not without interest, but as a chorus of screams evokes a more obvious take on ""Grass"", it's hard not to feel like you're drinking the purple stuff to Animal Collective's Sunny D. I think TSHDT would be a blast to see live, but in recorded format, they're hedging their bets-- an album that found them either really surrendering to musical anarchy or writing the pop songs that <em>Boo Hoo Hoo Boo</em> implies they could write would serve them better. </p></div>"|8318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8318-boo-hoo-hoo-boo/|5.8|Brian Howe

This is because their music, at its best, offers nearly everything I want out of pop records. The list of things I want is long and complicated (I hope), but start with just this one abstract thing: This band is absolutely unique in its vision and sound, and yet that uniqueness is an integral part of creating something beautiful. That's rarer than you might think. The things that are special and adventurous here aren't competing with beauty and accessibility. Neither are they merely coexisting with them-- they're actually the same things. The Cocteaus' best songs seem to be creating whole new sorts of beauty and energy, from scratch, and something about that gets to the root of what a lot of us want music to do in the first place.</p>
<p>Like a lot of UK bands of their era, much of that terrific Cocteau work was released on EPs. In fact, the band made terrific use of the format, giving each 12"" a distinct aesthetic, from the sound to the cover art to the song titles. For a long time, the only way to access that work on CD was a maroon box filled with 10 individual discs. It wasn't efficient, but it may have been the right way to appreciate it-- pulling out coherent, individual pieces, seeing the art, figuring out what each one had to say. <i>Lullabies to Violaine</i> is a lot more economical. It updates the span, running from 1982's <i>Lullabies</i> to 1996's <i>Violaine</i> (get it?), and it packages everything neatly on four discs to be sold in sets of two. (A limited-edition box of all four is also available.) The first set covers the band's years with 4AD, the ""arty"" London label whose aesthetic they did a great deal to define; the less-essential (but easy to like) second set covers their years with Mercury and Capitol. This means there is a whole career in here, as told in releases that always felt like miniature albums; for those who've skipped these, it's something like finding an alternate discography full of prime-era records.</p>
<p>The first disc tells the best part of the story. When they started in the early 1980s, the Cocteau Twins were possibly a little strange: a vaguely gothic post-punk act with a drum machine, some oddly processed guitars, ambitious song titles, and a keening, fluttery, operatic (and totally unintelligible) singer. They were scrappy and shadowy, definitely gritty and definitely human. But fairly early on, they began to bring something very un-punk out of their music: They started filling their songs with nods at grand, classicist <i>beauty</i>, with sounds people couldn't help associating with baroque arts and pre-Raphaelite oil paintings. They began to sound like someone had sent a punk band on a time-traveling tour of European cathedrals-- and the punk band had somehow managed to live up to it, standing there and forcing out something fittingly gorgeous, something that actually kind of sounded like Caravaggio.</p>
<p>Better yet, that atmosphere wasn't just cribbing from classical-music cues and baroque imagery: There was an incredible amount of sheer invention happening. On this first disc, post-punk takes flight: ""Feathers Oar Blades"" is a kind of new-wave dance unlike anything else, ""Sugar Hiccup"" launches into that swooning music for cathedrals, ""The Spangle Maker"" is both stirring and atmospheric. With the best tracks here, you can actually <i>hear</i> the effort in the songs: The band seems to be still standing in the post-punk basement, actually forcing something beautiful into existence down there between the cinder blocks. You can also hear them creating new sounds with each chronological EP. Elisabeth Fraser discovers her voice; along with Bjork, she's one of the best available arguments that acts like this can offer unusual vocal styles every bit as stirring and technically remarkable as any other genre. She learns how to multi-track her melodies into the interlocking hooks they'd later perfect; guitarist Robin Guthrie sorts out the grand wall of swooshing guitars (and effects) that would match them. Listening through these EPs on the same disc really does make the genuine b-level material stand out a bit more; pulling individual discs out of that maroon box, one tended to be distracted by the number of precious tracks. And fans will be disappointed to hear that the ""alternate versions"" of a few songs included here just sound wrong and ahistorical, even though that's how Guthrie wanted them in the first place. But there are plenty of precious things here-- more than most anything on your shelf.</p>
<p>Disc two is the age of riches: Having broken through to a distinctive sound, the Cocteaus set about broadening it, cleaning it up, learning where it might lead. On <i>Tiny Dynamine</i> they learn how to float-- ""Pink Orange Red"" is a bigger, more awe-inspiring cathedral (and one of their absolute best tracks), and the remainder of the EP cruises along into the chilly, delicate comforts of the future. <i>Echoes in a Shallow Bay</i> is darker and more turbulent, bringing back a drum-machine stomp and that hard, keening lower register of Frasier's voice. (This is beauty that frightens-- something that winds through a lot of Cocteau work, and surely accounts for some of those old-religion metaphors.) And the very-solid <i>Love's Easy Tears</i> may sit at the dead center of the entire Cocteau ouvre.</p>
<p>The part of their career that's missing is the one best represented by albums. As time went on, being beautiful wasn't even a strain anymore: If the <i>Treasure</i> LP has that taking-flight quality, then <i>Blue Bell Knoll</i> (the darker one) and <i>Heaven or Las Vegas</i> (the fluffier one) are just effortlessly dreamy. But eventually they began to seem a little <i>too</i> comfortable. The course of their career was like an airplane flight: There was the magic of watching them lift off the dirty runway and take wing, and there was the magic of breaking above the clouds and looking at a dreamworld, but after a while of coasting up there, the sun and clouds were just scenery.</p>
<p>The funny thing about listening through discs three and four, though, is that the material doesn't feel as much like the slide it did at the time; some of it is even prettier, more confident, more consistent, and still awfully adventurous. The title track of 1993's <i>Evangeline</i> EP (also an album track) is a peak of spooky comfort, with a vibe something like Julee Cruise's <i>Twin Peaks</i> songs, and after that come rare, much-loved Cocteau versions of ""Winter Wonderland"" and ""Frosty the Snowman"". By the end of the disc we've reached what once felt like the Twins' back-looking period, with the acoustic versions of older tracks on <i>Twinlights</i>. They're terrific listening, and disc four kicks off with something that's anything but backward-- the stunning <i>Otherness</i> EP, on which the band took up the ambient-techno format people had always said their music had a kinship with. It's with <i>Tishbite</i> that the band begins to feel a little like a fluffed-up, tooth-extracted, or just point-repeating version of its former self. But that's something that-- when you're listening through a compilation, and not eagerly awaiting an album-- doesn't even seem so bad.</p>
<p>That first volume-- the 4AD years-- still feels incredible: It's like watching geological action, where amidst a whole lot of dirty rumbling, brand-new awe-inspiring peaks burst up out of the earth. The second volume is like returning to those peaks and finding them fleshed out with trees and flowers and a visitors' station-- more inviting, but not so much where the action is. With either one, though, this is a spot its worth visiting. It's very easy to treat this band as an aberration or a cul-de-sac, a lone act with its own particular schtick. But don't forget that-- just as much as every band that pushed along a movement, inspired a whole genre, or did something else historically pivotal-- this act really <i>created</i> something.</p></div>"|11702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11702-lullabies-to-violaine-singles-and-extended-plays-1982-1996-vol-1-vol-2/|8.5|Nitsuh Abebe

And while Mitchell obviously doesn't bear sole responsibility for creating the archetype of the long-haired, coffeehouse folk chanteuse, there is no question that her success quickly inspired hundreds of similarly reflective young female songwriters to pick up their acoustic guitars and join in quixotic pursuit of lucrative recording careers. As a result, the following years witnessed a deluge of regionally produced and distributed folk albums-- the vast majority of which eventually found their way to family basements and Salvation Army stores, as their winsome authors returned unceremoniously to quiet obscurity.</i></p><p>
    
    Now, in order to better demonstrate the breadth of this movement and the astonishing reach of Mitchell's influence, the inveterate crate-diggers of the Numero Group present <em>Wayfaring Strangers: Ladies From the Canyon</em>. Diligently researched and compiled with the label's characteristic attention to detail, the collection gathers 14 impossibly rare tracks by female folkies from every corner of the nation, covering an era which spans roughly from 1971-76. Variously funded by parents, church groups or community organizations, these songs originally appeared on private-press albums that were issued in pressings as small as 50 copies, and each retains a certain undeniable handmade charm.</p><p>
    
    The compilation appears at a time when reissues of unjustly overlooked folk singers like Judee Sill, Vashti Bunyan, Bridget St. John, and Linda Perhacs are still fresh on the shelves. Unlike those performers, however, few artists on <em>Ladies From the Canyon</em> project a musical personality distinctive or eccentric enough to carry an entire album. (Nor, it should be noted, are there any truly psychedelic notes ever played or sung.) In fact, the most striking aspect of this collection is the utter uniformity of its perfomances, not only in sound but in mood and spirit. Nearly all of these vocalists sing in a rich, Joni-like alto over spare arrangements of guitar and piano. And despite their differences in geography and background, each performer achieves a nearly identical sense of dreamy, melancholic longing, sounding content to leave the wider dynamic range of rage, lust, joy, and defiance (not to mention humor) to a separate generation of female artists.</p><p>
    
    It would take a hardened heart, however, to ignore the simple beauty evident in tracks like Collie Ryan's gorgeous, haiku-like ""Cricket"" or Priscilla Quinby's nautical ""With All Hands"". And, as one might expect from such a ""real people"" collection, a couple of these tracks possess that indefinable, unschooled strangeness that is peculiar to outsider art. The most engaging such example is Shira Small's eliptical ""Eternal Life"", with its casual declaration that ""Eternal life is the intersection of the line of time and the plane of now."" Not to be outdone, the haunting ""Maybe in Another Year,"" is sung by Peoria teen Jennie Pearl with a clear-eyed innocence that recalls the best moments of the Langley Schools Music Project. Also noteworthy is 15-year-old Ellen Warshaw's surprisingly forceful and harrowing take on the Stones' ""Sister Morphine"", one of the few cuts that feels out of keeping with the collection's overall earth mother vibration.</p><p>
    
    Most of the performers on <em>Ladies From the Canyon</em> have long since retired from the music business. One notable exception is Barbara Sipple, who has since gone on to a successful career as an opera singer, and whose ""Song of Life"" is one of several here that is tinged with the mystic, soft-focused Christianity typical of the era. As further evidenced by tracks like Carla Sciaky's ""And I a Fairytale Lady"", there is constant yearning that courses through nearly all of these songs, a yearning for some external force-- be it Jesus, a waylaid Prince Charming, or simply a record contract-- to come and deliver each singer from her lonesome solitude. But as <em>Ladies From the Canyon</em> amply illustrates, these scattered, isolated voices were actually far from alone, and maybe their inclusion here within this fascinating time capsule can provide some small echo of the communion they once sought to gain through their long-neglected music. </p></div>"|2080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2080-wayfaring-strangers-ladies-from-the-canyon/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

It's a gorgeously idyllic scene: the trees' slender white trunks, the canopy of green. But there's something decidedly unnatural about the image. The hall-of-mirrors symmetry smacks of digital manipulation, of a version of nature enhanced by technology.</p>
<p>The same can be said of Talkdemonic's instrumental post-rock, which lays a bevy of acoustic elements over a foundation of pulsing programmed beats and modulating, soft-focus synthesizers. The duo acquiesces to this tension, cheekily dubbing their music ""folktronic hop,"" a hybrid genre that seems to have its roots in records like Bjork's <i>Homogenic. </i>But, without a doubt, it's the players, not the preset laptop tracks, who lend Talkdemonic's music its emotional heft. Kevin O'Connor plays banjo, guitar, piano, and Wurlitzer on the recording, but it's his highly expressive drumming that is most memorable. When the punctuated rhythm of programmed percussion gives way to cascading cymbal crashes and spacious break beats, it's nothing short of cathartic. And viola-player Lisa Molinaro's performances ooze with feeling, as beautiful swells of strings render the need for vocals understandably dispensable.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Beat Romantic </i>are dense sonic architectures, adding layer upon layer of melody and counter-melody as they grow. On album opener ""Veraison"", a truncated viola loop repeats for the song's duration, as Molinaro blankets it in a palimpsest of overdubs, her legato bowing countering the clipped repetition of the sample. ""Dusty Flourescent/Wooden Shelves"" begins with a misleading sense of restraint, all plucked banjo strings and roomy snare strikes. But 15 seconds in, O'Connor absolutely thrashes his kit as a descending bass line and ascending synth riff expand the background. Beat Romantic's highlight, though, is the one-two punch of ""Bering"" and ""Human Till Born"". Teeming with soaring harmonies, ""Bering"" features Molinaro's most affecting playing. As she abusively rakes the strings of her viola at the end of the song, the track segues into a feast of pummeling drums that would make DJ Shadow proud.</p>
<p>While Talkdemonic's streamlined compositions avoid the trappings of more self-indulgent instrumental acts, at times, they could use a little more room to breathe. Many songs don't make it past two minutes, which results in the album unfolding like a single piece of nearly continuous music. Such unity is a credit to their sense of vision, even if it suppresses some of their best melodies in a kind of sameness. But, also like the cover's birch grove, <i>Beat Romantic's</i> allure isn't in isolated beauty, but the juxtaposition of so much of it.</p></div>"|8316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8316-beat-romantic/|7.8|John Motley

It's such a transparent symbol that it practically dictates the emotional touchstones that follow: grief, determination, tribulation, and triumph. Jessi Colter, however, makes it sound genuine and poignant, if not necessarily new, on <em>Out of the Ashes</em>, her first album in two decades. That alone is one reason she can get away with it; this record is obviously a new start for her. More crucially, this is her first album since the death of her husband and collaborator, Waylon Jennings. As such, it's a statement of coming to terms and moving on-- somewhat predictable, but Colter makes it work with a brassy performance and a well-rounded selection of songs.</p><p>
    
    Colter wants to stress the point that while she's been through some hard times, she's far from dead or defeated. On ""The Phoenix Rises"", a patient ballad about starting over, she sings, ""New beginnings are hard to find/ New beginnings are mountains to climb."" She's still got her powerful voice, her memories of her husband, and the comfort of friends and family, many of whom guest on the album. She deals with these issues on the album's numerous ballads, including the centerpiece ""Out of the Rain"", which features backing vocals by Tony Joe White and Jennings himself, who recorded his parts before he died. On ""Please Carry Me Home"", Colter is joined by her son Shooter Jennings, but his roughly textured voice sounds more at ease on his own rock-country albums and doesn't really blend well with his mother's.</p><p>
    
    These big statements of rebirth and recovery can be almost overwhelming in their autobiographical significance. Fortunately, Colter peppers the album with more upbeat numbers that don't have such heavy personal baggage but still showcase her well-aged voice. With its bluesy stomp and Colter's brash putdowns, ""You Can Pick 'Em"" sounds like <i>Car Wheels-era Lucinda Williams, and her cover of Dylan's ""Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35"" sounds almost like desert country psychedelia. She's at her best on ""Velvet and Steel"", a raunchy duet with guitarist Ray Herndon that's full of sly sexual innuendo. Even Don Was' dry, too-tasteful production, which evokes a well-funded studio more than Colter's beloved Arizona landscape, can't diminish the impact of these songs. From the too-precise guitars on ""You Can Pick 'Em"" to the too-tasteful cello on ""So Many Things"", his production buffs away any blemishes and robs crucial moments of their intimacy and directness. A few more rough edges might have given Colter's ruminations on loss and life a little more force and made this comeback all the more memorable.</i></p></div>"|1834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1834-out-of-the-ashes/|7.0|Stephen M.

    clear niche for itself. Wilkinson is a pretty fair steel guitar
    player; his music essentially consists of recordings of him doing his
    thing and then processing the results in very specific ways. Every
    word I can think of to describe his music begins with the first letter of
    his last name: It sounds worn, weathered, woozy, warped, warbling, and
    warm. Wilkinson clearly loves folk and a certain strand of idyllic
    electronic music equally, and has found an efficient place for the two
    to meet.</p><p>
    
    Bibio's amorphous debut <em>Fi</em> came from nowhere, like something
    found underneath a moss-covered stone on a morning walk. Here on <em>Hand
    Cranked</em> he seems to have whittled his signature style down to a rather
    fine point. As someone who adores the sound of acoustic instruments
    bent and treated with common distortion, I'm willing to allow
    Wilkinson enormous latitude when it comes to his narrow production
    obsessions. Virtually every track here features plucked guitar treated
    in a small handful of ways, with the highs and lows filtered out (to
    give the old radio illusion of age) and on tape that just can't manage
    to maintain its speed. It's something a lot of people will tire of
    after a short while, but the sonority he manages somehow keeps me
    consistently engaged.</p><p>
    
    What's not working for me is Wilkinson's approach to songwriting. One
    bad habit he seems to have picked up from more recent Boards of Canada-- who first brought him to the attention of the label Mush-- is a
    tendency to use ridged loops of short phrases as the basis of
    composition. On the bulk of the tracks he plays two or three bars on
    one chord, then two or three bars on another, and then back to the
    first, ad nauseum. Though other subtle bits like backward leads and
    strands of drone are dropped in and out, the tracks in general are
    circular and static, without any particular reason for lasting any
    particular length of time. I can't help thinking that if Wilkinson
    were to take a few additional pages out of Ye Olde Book of British
    Folk and incorporate song and ballad chord structures into his work,
    while maintaining the aged recording techniques, he might really have
    something. The few tracks where he breaks out of his usual mold are
    far and away the most satisfying, particularly ""Abberiw"", a vocal
    track on which Wilkinson sings quite well (he sounds a tad like Robert
    Pollard, actually). I don't doubt we'll hear more from Bibio, but
    there's not much here to separate <em>Hand Cranked</em> from the slightly
    better debut.</p></div>"|1138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1138-hand-cranked/|6.1|Mark Richardson

When Srivastava moved to Glasgow at the age of 19, he'd already written the tracks that would comprise the <i>Raised By Wolves</i> EP, songs with deft arrangments and charming melodies that evoke Belle &amp; Sebastian, Morrissey, and the Lucksmiths, but with jagged, rumbling guitars remindful of early Cure and, sometimes, Joy Division. Srivastava immersed himself in Glasgow's nightclub scene, developing a particularly strong affinity for Optimo. The commingling of his jangle-pop roots and his newfound love of dance music is writ large in the Texas-based band's turbocharged twee.</p>
<p>Voxtrot's two EPs are so consistent and evenly matched that I'm going to address them as a single entity, although <i>Raised By Wolves</i> suffers slightly for having one tepid track, the late-Jawbreakerish ""Wrecking Force"". There's nothing terribly wrong with it; it's just not as spectacularly right as the other nine songs rounding out Voxtrot's recorded work. If there's any significant difference between the EPs, it's that <i>Wolves</i> is a little more obvious, with wafting respites like ""The Start of Something"" and ""Long Haul"" to blunt the serrated thrust that overtakes <i>Mothers, Sisters, Daughters &amp; Wives</i>. This is probably why <i>Wolves</i> lept out as my initial favorite, until I'd listened to both EPs for long enough to internalize them and consider <i>Mothers</i> slightly stronger, if slightly more forbidding.</p>
<p>Despite his jones for beats, Srivastava complies with twee tradition by allowing his singing and lyrics to assume center stage. His voice is forceful and tender in equal measure, dancing around central melodies with uncommon mobility and vigor. On ""Missing Pieces"", he moves effortlessly from a quivering falsetto to a soulful moan within the space of the word ""you""; ""Rise Up in the Dirt"" finds him equally comfortable at a croon and a near-shout. His lyrics strike a balance between open-hearted sentimentality and wry bemusment, leavened with artful obliquity and lexical music. If its melody weren't so exquisitely naïve, ""The Start of Something"" would collapse under lines like ""I'm a love letter away"" and ""If I die clutching your photograph/ Don't call me boring, it's just 'cause I like you."" But Srivastava seems to be at the mercy of his paramour to an almost unhealthy degree, and bitter acknowledgements of this dependency repeatedly deflate his whimsy: ""Everyone loves a man who lets the hardest people/ Build him up and cut him down to loveable size,"" he sings on ""Soft &amp; Warm"".</p>
<p>Voxtrot's music, though, is far more than a platform for Srivastava's vocal performances. The guitar work on both EPs, but particularly on <i>Mothers</i>, is a model of constrained energy, and the songs blossom with controlled detonations, like small charges set off sequentially to demolish a huge building. The complex arrangments never intrude upon the lucid melodic arcs; subtle string and brass sections are meted out judiciously. A twinkling piano phrase tiptoes around the careening guitars of ""Rise Up in the Dirt""; a fountain of chimes spills languidly over ""Long Haul"". And while Voxtrot's kinetic thrust may be the product Srivastava's inspiration, the rhythm section has to be credited for realizing it. Like the vocals, the basslines use melodies the way a gymnast uses parallel bars, their combination of mobile force and memorable sonority evoking the Dismemberment Plan's Eric Axelson. The percussion is crisp and compressed, so that each song displays lively patterns of overlapping movement within a tight sonic field. As is always the case with music like this, you'll come for the droll melodies. But whether it's the simmering drum and voice breakdown of ""Missing Pieces"" or the wedge of stately post-punk dropped convincingly into the middle of the otherwise fey ""The Start of Something"", you'll stay for the inspired songwriting choices and confident execution.</p></div>"|11861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11861-raised-by-wolves-ep-mothers-sisters-daughters-wives-ep/|7.8|Brian Howe

Their candyprog blitz-- which combines Krautrock precision with U2-size melodies-- is better suited to a show like ""Battlestar Galactica"", with its Cylon battles and lost-in-space conspiracies, than to beach houses and young sunny romance. This is by no means a strike against the Texas trio: On the band's first full-length, they made cockpit music that was smarter and more confident than they got credit for, and those seemingly contradictory sonic elements-- the minutiae of the rhythms and the broad strokes of melody-- inflated each other to widescreen proportions, excusing the band's similarities to Pink Floyd and the Flaming Lips, while suggesting they had stumbled onto some new combination of these common influences.</p><p>
    The Secret Machines' follow-up, <i>Ten Silver Drops, is more earthbound than its predecessor-- the aftermath of the battle or the adrenaline crash. The band is less concerned with the previous album's veiled post-9/11 implications, which made </i><i>Now Here sound like coded messages from a life-during-wartime underground. Instead, these eight songs (not 10-- we're two silver drops short) address everyday issues like romantic fallout, narcotic paranoia, and intraband relations. The first few sound the most invested: ""Alone, Jealous &amp; Stoned"" is reportedly about the band members' simultaneous breakups with their respective others, as if the draw of the road has proved stronger than the pull of another human. ""All at Once (It's Not Important)"" explores this palpable pessimism even further, risking an emotional frankness that flirts with, but ultimately transcends, emo recrimination. ""Remember back when we first met, it don't mean much,"" Brandon Curtis sings. ""All those things you said you never meant."" Despite its thudding bombast-- it's both the heaviest and most agile song on the album-- ""Lightning Blue Eyes"" is tender where ""All at Once"" is cold, as Curtis tries to find some use for now useless memories.</i></p><p>
    Together, those tracks form a strong stoner trilogy that derives its power from the songs' candor and contradictions. Plus, the subject matter brings out the best in the musicians, as they orchestrate these mood swings for maximum impact, sounding as big and as serious as ever-- even as they wallow in gloomy downheartedness. Unfortunately, these songs are immediately followed by ""Daddy's in the Doldrums"", the weakest track here, a plodding eight-minute riff on drugs that quotes a drumbeat straight from <i>Now Here and features the band's silliest lyrics. ""I Hate Pretending"" continues in that same vein (no pun intended), upping the paranoia as Brandon Curtis describes a potential drug bust. But he hangs the hook on the line, ""There's an undercover cop parked right across the road,"" which seems too clunky and pedestrian to be anything but goofy in this context. The directness of these two songs is telling: There's not much to either of them, even as they play into the druggy clichés of the Machines' influences.</i></p><p>
    Perhaps the album's critical flaw is that songwriting and sound seem less integrated. Brandon Curtis often sounds like he's singing over the music, not with it. The songs hew too closely to the lyrical structures, leaving the band no space to sprawl or, god forbid, jam. As a result, <i>Ten Silver Drops settles into a midtempo sameness over its second half. ""Faded Lines"", with its chorus of filtered voices, ticks upward momentarily, an epilogue to that initial trilogy in quality as much as theme. After that, the album lingers for two more songs: The sonic wallpaper of ""I Want to Know"" wastes one of Ben Curtis's best guitar lines, while ""1,000 Seconds"" sounds cumbersome as it tries to make a final statement on romantic disappointment. By that point, the mood is ruined, the buzz hashed. </i></p><p>
<i>Ten Silver Drops is an album in need of some plan of attack. Lacking the dynamic cohesion that made its predecessor more than the sum of its tracklist, it feels like merely a collection of random tracks, which, despite their common themes, begin to sound haphazard in their arrangements and sequencing. The problem isn't that they're grounded in real-life problems-- that might be the album's strongest draw. But just because the relationships have stalled doesn't mean the music should lose its forward momentum as well.</i></p></div>"|7059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7059-ten-silver-drops/|6.3|Stephen M.

Having unexpectedly
    found himself sandwiched between gospel groups at a Baptist church venue,
    Gelb watched as one choir after another performed, and the resonance of
    their rich, captivating voices wove through audience and into his blood.
    His inspiration to work with a choir came that day, and he
    returned to the church just in time to catch the final performance by
    Voices of Praise, the ensemble that eventually featured on <em>'Sno Angel Like
    You</em>.</p><p>
    
    The drive behind these recordings was to experiment with the juxtaposition
    between Gelb's experimental alt-country rambling and the warm,
    compositional synchronicity of a gospel choir. The result of this unlikely
    alliance is a delicately sparse collection of eight new songs that were
    sketched out specifically for the choir (who added their own vocal
    arrangements over the top), three re-workings of Gelb tracks written with
    his long-running group, Giant Sand, and three pieces written by
    the late Tucson guitarist Rainer Ptacek, a friend of Gelb's who died in
    1997. Gelb's prowling, confident horse-trot rhythms entwine with Arcade
    Fire drummer Jeremy Gara's subtle beats, providing a new twist to Gelb's
    songwriting since the recent departure of Giant Sand's long-term rhythm
    section, Joey Burns and John Convertino (both of Calexico). Matched with the
    engaging beauty of the choral voices-- which sound like a completely natural part
    of the music, never gimmicky or superfluous-- this more skeletal rhythmic
    style allows Gelb to be freer with his compositions, and consequently
    these are some of the most memorable songs he has written.</p><p>
    
    ""If you don't get the fuel, pray get the passion to keep the spirit
    rolling,"" Gelb sings on the opening track, ""Get to Leave"", which
    originally appeared on Giant Sand's 1989 <em>Long Stem Rant</em>. This kind
    of optimism permeates the feel of this record, backed up by the opulent,
    celebratory heave of the vocal lines. ""That's How Things Get Done"" is
    similarly a kick in the ass for positive thinking, though not, one feels,
    without Gelb's devilish smattering of irony. Despite his affection for
    sonic ""muck"", he holds back from wielding the sharp side of the blade too
    dangerously. The closest he gets is the snaky guitar solo freak out of
    ""The Voice Within"". Unlike Cat Power's <em>The Greatest</em>, also a melding of
    improbable genres and solo artists, Gelb sounds entirely comfortable in
    this musical environment, and with its subtly joyous tones and lustrous
    songwriting, <em>'Sno Angel Like You turns out to be a labor of love with
    endless rewards.</em></p></div>"|3420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3420-sno-angel-like-you/|8.3|Mia Lily Clarke

Just 
    when you thought they'd run out of great records to reissue from some genre 
    or other-- post-punk, let's say-- out comes another mother lode from the vinyl 
    mine and the collector's job gets even harder. If you bought all the 
    reissues and kept up with all the mp3 blogs, you'd wind up with enough music 
    in three just months to keep your ears packed until your great-great 
    grandchildren shuffled off their genetically engineered mortal coils. But to 
    the subject of post-punk's continued dividend payments: Maximum Joy were pretty special, and they deserve the resurrection treatment as much as 
    anyone.</p><p>
<em>Unlimited</em> is a puzzlingly incomplete set-- it caps off at 56 
    minutes, while also dropping four tracks from the band's only LP, 1982's 
    <i>MXJY, which one imagines would have nicely filled out the rest of the disc. 
    But while it's enough to make a completist wince in abject pain, the track 
    listing is a pretty solid set of 
    disco-dub-funk-jazz-punk (and you could tack a couple other syllables on that 
    hyphenate, too). Maximum Joy were the brainchild of vocalist Janine Rainforth and Tony Wafter, who were later joined by ex-Pop Group members John 
    Waddington and Dan Catsis. The music is reminiscent of the Pop Group's groundbreaking work but delivered in a more accessible vein, taming the nastier elements.</i></p><p>
    
    Rainforth has a smooth, even alto that probably would 
    have been singing British prog-folk 10 years earlier and trip-hop 10 years 
    later. It even sounds pleasant when they run it 
    backward at the end of ""White &amp; Green Place"", though she does get in a 
    couple of blood-curdling screams that scared the shit out of my cats on 
    ""Stretch (99 Version)"". The latter track plays like it's made out of 
    rubber, with scratchy guitars chicken-strutting over Kev Evans' funky bass 
    part and nasty sax interjections. Tony Wrafter's arsenal of wind instruments 
    gives the band a lot of its flavor-- he plays his sax and trumpet nice and 
    smooth to complement the neo-hippie lyrics of ""Searching for a Feeling"", and 
    he blows skronk all over the dub tracks.</p><p>
    
    Maximum Joy prove to be a far less sarcastically named band than the Pop 
    Group-- though they're far from sunny or optimistic, their music 
    is stuffed with danceable grooves and bears a distinct lack of menace. It's 
    not exactly pop; as melodic as it is, it's not usually very catchy, but it's bound to appeal to fans of post-punk's more jagged side. I can see fans of the Pop Group and early Shriekback 
    (not in print at the moment, nudge, nudge) loving Maximum Joy, as they fall about 
    halfway between those other two bands. If that's not your thing, don't 
    worry-- there's bound to be a reissue of something up your alley next week.</p></div>"|5682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5682-unlimited-1979-1983/|7.8|Joe Tangari

The title and opening track begins with an unaccompanied female voice singing one note. Her voice is then inhumanly manipulated over stark percussion and a few staccato acoustic chords and, eventually, transformed into more traditional guitar-based folk with harmonies from Tunng's two main players, Mike Lindsay and Sam Genders.</i></p><p>
    
    While I'm charmed by the reference to the discoverers of DNA in the love song ""Code Breakers"" and vaguely creeped out by <em>The Wicker Man</em> vibe in ""Fair Doreen"", the record continually falls into the same patterns-- straightforward folk with brief diversions, rustic samples or electronic percussion. ""People Folk"" is a more accessible Beta Band-like lurch, with sparse, pounding drums; ""Out the Window With the Widow"" is even more bare-- a few banjo plucks underneath Lomaxian echo, with electronic snaps and the hippie chanting of Lindsay and Genders. ""Beautiful and Light"" brings a more concrete melody plucked from acoustic guitar, along with a tender, memorable vocal line. A few far-off bell chimes tug the heartstrings a little harder, and the echo on the vocals and train engine samples add nostalgia while the skittering beat retains the urgency.</p><p> 
    
    It's impossible not to cite the Books after hearing this album's squishy, affectedly ancient percussion, not to mention the circular rhythm and vocal samples in ""Kinky Vans"". Artists like the Books-- or, say, the Junior Boys-- fully embrace dance/electric instead of merely spicing up their songs with a hint of otherness, and they don't flinch at leaving verse/chorus/verse behind. That's where Tunng falls short (or, in the case of ""People Folk"" or ""Kinky Vans"", just sound derivative).</p><p> 
    
    But am I reticent with praise because I need to put Tunng in a genre or a label? Or is it that Tunng aren't even trying to reach the bar they've set for themselves? Let's not knock simple folk songs, because Tunng have some great ones; ""Beautiful and Light"" even gains something from the production methods. But adding a few samples here and there doesn't deserve accolades in and of itself, and updating the time-worn with the cutting edge merits more than just a few pretty tracks.</p></div>"|8317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8317-mothers-daughterand-other-songs/|6.5|Jason Crock

Hypnotically restless, the East Coast purist has homed in on a rap palette full of vivid hurt and strafing alarm-- and bursting forth with some of the most potent yarns, barbs, and production of his remarkably consistent career, <em>Fishscale</em> is the choice outcome of a creative mind using experience as a compass en route to triumph.</p><p>  Though Ghostface's veteran status informs much of his fifth solo album, his father-knows-best pose is led by breathless rhymes, not nostalgia.  To wit, ""Whip You With a Strap"" rails against the lack of consequences brought upon today's youth with a smooth cleverness, while ""Big Girl"" moans about three fast-living women wasting their potential on cocaine mounds.  Tellingly, it's Ghost's own coke the girls can't stop sniffing.  Such ambiguities eschew didacticism for a lived-in wisdom that's as wicked as it is worthwhile.</p><p>  Ghost's godfather-cause is most noticeably directed at ostentatious modern-day rap hustlers who largely cook up tales with broad lines and no consequences, as he devotes several of <em>Fishscale</em>'s 18 songs to the booming drug-rap subgenre he helped launch in 1995 with Raekwon's <em>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...</em>.  On both ""R.A.G.U."" and ""Kilo"", Rae turns up to assist his close friend, describing the perils of the drug trade. Hardly akin to the dealer-as-infallible-ghetto-champion guise currently purported by the likes of Young Jeezy, <em>Fishscale</em>'s dope peddlers are harried and frayed.  Between broken wrists, familial strife, and self-inflicted gunshots to the groin, ""R.A.G.U."" is anything but glorifying toward its stressed-out, drug-running protagonists.</p><p>  But the album's most vivid illicit spectacle belongs to Ghost alone; ""Shakey Dog"" takes the rapper's penchant for eye-popping lyrical imagery to its extreme, offering a twisty Mamet-style narrative about a botched two-man robbery attempt.  ""Fasten your seatbelts,"" warns the Staten Island son before unraveling a scene so perfectly lucid that an accompanying video would be redundant.  Whether describing the alluring smells coming from his victim's apartment or the ruthless history of an ancillary old lady (""She paid her dues when she smoked her brother-in-law at her boss' wedding"") he passes on his way up to the place, Ghost touches on myriad senses and memories-- it's the kind of song that requires several close listens to understand at all.  It also strongly suggests that, if Ghost ever loses his appetite for rap, he might find success as a screenwriter.</p><p>  As the album's other specific tragedies-- shitty haircuts, bus stop infatuation gone awry-- fly by with deft everyman flourishes, it's the surreal ""Underwater"", with its strange spirituality, that proves most trenchant.  The dreamy account finds our hero playing out a possible afterlife allegory while swimming at the bottom of the ocean.  ""I'm not on my turf,"" he confesses as mermaids ""with Halle Berry haircuts"" offer guidance along the way.  In the tourist role, Ghost is as compelling as when he's recounting pavement-bred stories of his familiar youth.  Sometimes on ""Underwater"", the two come together brilliantly like when he notices ""SpongeBob in a Bentely coup, bangin' the Isleys.""  Eventually arriving at the ""world's banginest mosque,"" Ghost finds comfort in Muslim chants; the rapper's rare moment of peace is well-deserved amidst <em>Fishscale</em>'s enthralling agony.  Aiding in the track's calming vibes is a mysterious, flute-laden beat courtesy of MF Doom, who's responsible for four beats on the record.  The masked supervillain is in the company of a reputable bevy of soul-stacked sample-masters on <em>Fishscale</em> and their musical backdrops match Ghost's focus and vision.</p><p>  In an interview with RZA last year, he told me, ""Listen to how Ghost sounds rappin' over one of my beats and then over another beat... he sounds like a grown man [on my beat] and he sound younger on [other] producers' beats because they don't know the frequency.""  But, as the first solo Ghost disc without a RZA production, <em>Fishscale</em> attests he was wrong.  Whether it's the late Dilla providing his off-kilter vinyl-hiss haze for ""Strap"", Pete Rock cutting up Sly Stone's ""Family Affair"" on the hollow funk of posse cut ""Dogs of War"", or Just Blaze doing his Banger 101 thing on ""The Champ"" (which, stripped of its bootleg <em>Rocky</em> samples at the last minute thanks to copyright issues, still packs heat), each producer takes his opportunity to envelop today's most soulful rapper with deep swaths of vintage samples and deep drums.  The RZA's sonic influence remains strong-- and he even shows up briefly on the excellent Wu reunion cut ""9 Milli Bros""-- but his absence behind the <em>Fishscale</em> boards is largely inconsequential.</p><p>  Considering Ghost's continued status as one of hip-hop's most revered, relevant elder statesmen, it seems odd that his name was seldom bandied about in most of the last decade's King of New York debates.  <em>Fishscale</em> reiterates with cinematic verve that the most vital current Wu Tang Clan member's storytelling can match Biggie's in both excitement and humor.  Yet Ghost's songs are unrelenting in their slavishness to density and credibility, and that can turn off casual listeners even as it intoxicates hip-hop purists.  ""My arts is crafty darts, why y'all stuck with 'Laffy Taffy'?"" he asks with utter sincerity on ""The Champ"".  As long as inevitable questions like that continually re-up this heavyweight's unswerving drive, they're probably better left unanswered.</p><p> </p></div>"|3637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3637-fishscale/|9.0|Ryan Dombal

    die. Shoehorned into one of those two-engine propeller planes, surrounded by 
    screaming kids, snow starting to fall, warnings of turbulence crackling over 
    the loudspeakers, nothing looked good. I slid on my Walkman and tried not to 
    move until the whole thing was over, but then something amazing happened. 
    ""Teardrop"" came on, a rainy, depressive drum track giving away to a 
    breathtakingly gorgeous two-note harpsichord line, shivery guitar bits 
    floating in, Liz Fraser cooing angelically, everything building slowly and 
    gently into a blissful haze while I stared out the tiny porthole window at 
    the sun setting over a frozen forest. All of a sudden, everything was going 
    to be OK.</p><p>
    
    Massive Attack's music brings back memories: not that crazy weekend you 
    piled into a van and drove down to New Orleans for New Year's Eve, but those 
    quiet and isolated instants, images that stuck in your mind for no reason, 
    moments when your life started to feel like a movie. That's why Hollywood 
    has been pillaging the group's catalogue for more than a decade, using its 
    songs to score Sharon Stone humping a Baldwin in <em>Sliver</em> or Brad Pitt's mom's 
    trailer burning in <em>Snatch</em>. ""Teardrop"" is Massive Attack's biggest-ever hit, 
    the only time the group grazed the UK's top 10 singles chart, but more 
    Americans know it as the theme to ""House"" than anything else.</p><p>
    
    Massive Attack have never been anyone's idea of a singles act, and that's 
    what makes the idea of a best-of album a bit dodgy. The group has only 
    released four proper albums over the past 15 years: one absolute 
    must-have masterpiece, two excellent long-players of languidly 
    existential mood-music, and one total piece of shit. <i>Collected 
    is sequenced for flow, not for chronology, even though any 14 
    randomly-selected Massive Attack tracks would flow together just fine. This 
    means that music from that piece of shit, the band's recent <em>100th Window</em>, is more difficult to avoid; the anemic IDM 
    drums and imitation-<em>Kid A</em> processed vocals of ""Butterfly Caught"" sound even 
    worse when sandwiched between relative masterpieces like ""Protection"" and 
    ""Unfinished Sympathy"". A bonus disc of rarities rescues the crushingly 
    claustrophobic electro-dub Mos Def collaboration ""I Against I"" from the 
    <em>Blade 2</em> soundtrack, but it's mostly given over to gloppy, dismal background 
    fare, making it difficult to understand why it's here at all.</i></p><p>
    
    But a few inevitable stopovers in bullshit-land don't 
    change the fact that <em>Collected</em> is a pretty incredible set of tracks; the 
    group's fierce, creepy, paranoid fogscapes have aged better than the glassy 
    boutique-music of any of their 90s trip-hop imitators. They've always fit 
    better into the UK's Eno-PiL-Radiohead continuum of woozy pop 
    experimentalists than into any loosely defined electronica scene anyway, and 
    listening now, it's remarkable how they managed to combine so much disparate 
    source-material into their expansively deep groove. The early masterpiece 
    ""Five Man Army"" builds off the intricate, sidelong drum break from Al 
    Green's ""I'm Glad You're Mine"", the same one Eric B &amp; Rakim used for 
    ""Mahogany"", layering on a relentlessly burbley bassline, an emaciated 
    late-Specials guitar-skank, and a ghostly flute while Tricky, Daddy G, and 
    3D trade loose, free-associative rap verses and reggae vet Horace Andy's 
    croon floats over the gaps.</p><p>
    
    Other tracks add glistening pools of flanged-out 
    postpunk guitars and lushly romantic strings and lonely jazz-saxophone 
    flourishes. A small army of female guest-vocalists are featured (ethereal 
    Fraser, soulfully robust Shara Nelson, wistfully precise Tracey Thorn), but 
    the tracks never lose their dusty menace. The main disc ends with a new 
    song, ""Live With Me"", an itchy, ringing, gorgeous slow burn with a broken, 
    smoky vocal from Chicago folk-jazz legend Terry Callier, and it shows that 
    the group may not have utterly died with the abject failure of <em>100th Window</em>. 
    <em>Collected</em> may not be a substitute for grabbing the group's essential records, but you'll be happy to have it the next time you end up on a two-engine propeller plane.</p></div>"|5137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5137-collected/|8.3|Tom Breihan

These days, those two genres' poster-boys have turned their backs on the sounds that made them. Jack White prefers creepy pencil-thin moustaches over ragged riffs and the Liars still dig drums, but definitely don't dance. The Washington-based trio the Gossip are still right there in the thick of it, straddling a fine line between the two.</p><p>
    
    On its third album, <em>Standing in the Way of Control</em>, the band tampers with its formula, chucking ragged punk for a more streamlined dance-informed sound. New drummer Hannah Blilie (formerly of Seattle's Chromatics) delivers metronomic hi-hat hits and four-on-the-floor bass kicks, while guitarist Brace Paine plays the versatile one, turning in bouncing bass lines and hooks that range from thin and trebly to distortion-drenched. But the band's calling card is singer Beth Ditto's powerfully soulful voice, which registers somewhere between Ann Wilson wail and bloodcurdling riot grrrl cord-shredder. At times, her vocals sound completely at odds with the music: far too bluesy for such a cool dance machine. Then again, it's quite a distinction among a glut of post-punk revivalists.</p><p>
    
    The album's heart is wrapped up in a three-song suite that kicks off with the uncharacteristically down-tempo ""Coal to Diamonds"". As Brace alternates between an ambling guitar line and rhythmic, but restrained down-strokes against Blilie's spare drums, it's <em>Standing</em>'s first sign that the Gossip can let the motor idle. The space gives Ditto's enormous voice plenty of room to emote, as she sings of a failed romance, ""I thought about it 'til my head hurt."" ""Eyes Open"" builds on an insistent kick-drum thud and some caveman riffing that makes it clear that, even though they were raised in the South, they were weaned on Sabbath's version of the blues. And ""Yr Mangled Heart"" splits the difference between the two, as Brace's circular guitar and Blilie's crisp snare set a pace that repeatedly threatens to break into a full-fledged dance song. It's a kind of tease, in which the band continually reins itself and lets it all hang out in an ebb and flow of loud and quiet passages. </p><p>
    
    While the tight playing and vocal pyrotechnics are impressive, Ditto's narrow lyrical scope gets really redundant. Most of the time, she comes off like a scrappy older sister who's fought at life's frontlines and lived-- just to deliver skin-saving insights like ""fight fire with fire,"" ""on the playground we learn so much,"" or ""you don't have to do this alone."" Unless you listen to records to buoy your self-esteem, this stuff plays puddle-deep. But that feel-good vibe brings the Gossip a little closer to disco's oblivious bliss. So who cares? Just shut up and dance, punks.</p></div>"|3536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3536-standing-in-the-way-of-control/|6.8|John Motley

    embedded associations mixing with the open-ended signifiers of
    electronic music. The guitar, so bound to Western popular music since
    the middle of the 20th century, seems particularly receptive to
    careful dissection by microprocessor. Many personal favorites from the past
    five years have come from someone trying to figure out novel ways to
    process an instrument and render the familiar new.</p><p>
    As you might guess from the name German musician Michael Lückner gives
    to his project, he's a fan of the six-string. His first record with
    the name was 2001's <em>Sunkissed</em>, released, appropriately enough, on
    Morr. The album was a clear tribute to My Bloody Valentine's
    <em>Loveless</em>, the guiding force for Lückner's experiments in sound
    manipulation. Following this well-received record, Lückner spent a
    good deal of time in Japan, and his 2004 <em>Honeysky</em>
    never made it out of that country. The inspiration for his third
    record comes from instruments he encountered there, particularly the
    guitar-like koto and pipa.</p><p>
    They are indeed lovely-sounding instruments, and Lückner ably
    integrates their timbre into his sound. Problem is, there's not much
    going on beyond laying loops of various plucked phrases atop dully
    repetitive mid-tempo drum programming. Tracks throughout feel stiff
    and ridged; you can almost see the constituent parts of each being
    dragged and dropped into place and snapped into the grid. Very little
    processing is happening on ""Naoki"" and ""Red and White"", and the tunes
    are nice enough, but the lack of development and table-flat dynamic
    range makes for pleasant background music and nothing more.</p><p>
    Vocalist and regular Lückner collaborator Ayako Akashiba joins on
    ""Tokyo Memory"" and contributes to most of the remaining tracks. Her
    style is prototypically Japanese indie, with its high, breathy coos,
    and it also sounds remarkably like one of the sisters in Múm. Two of
    the tracks with Akashiba hearken back to Guitar's shoegaze
    sound, with Lückner running his instruments through a chain of pedals
    (or some digital equivalent), and these are by far the most
    interesting. They work because they sound less careful and inhibited,
    without the fussy concern for every plucked string to be in its
    precise place. ""Sakura Coming"", with its throbbing sheets of sound
    underneath Akashiba's voice, sounds so much sloppier and less mannered
    than anything that comes before, with a weird mix and timings that
    don't quite line up. It's a flash of messy life on a record that too
    often feels half asleep.</p></div>"|3604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3604-tokyo/|5.2|Mark Richardson

    Laden rhetoric as your band name or adopting EMF as your go-to touchstone. Take
    your pick, but as the conflicting album title suggests, this British
    quartet certainly loves offering up gauche material and immediately
    negating it with the irony card. All the classic dance-rock
    trappings are here-- chameleon vocals, Cure shoutouts, klutzy
    synthesizers-- each glazed in glam-rock flair and Killers-grade
    pedigree. Problem is, Infadels practically grabbed the worst of all worlds. As
    songwriters, they resemble the Cure only rhythm-deep, and
    their rigid ditties lack the over-the-topness enjoyed by some of their more dramatic and committed peers.</p><p>
    
    Thematically, the album reads pretty transparent. A quick glance at the
    tracklist reveals the intersecting threads of romance and modernity;
    frontman and John Malkovich clone Bnann opines over ""Love Like Semtex"" the
    ""Girl Who Speaks No Words"" when he's not bellyaching over ""Reality TV"" and
    ""Stories From the Bar"". However, all yammering aside, the Infadels still
    grate on a musical level. Carefree single ""Can't Get Enough"" practically
    boasts its own appeal, though Bnann's Brandon Flowers aping doesn't quite
    register as infectiously as he would like to think. Instrumentally, these
    guys are all over the place, updating anyone from Peter Gabriel to the
    Fall into a slickly produced mass of 80s kitsch. Unfortunately,
    too many basslines stall, too many synth melodies taper off, and too many
    drum beats grow stale right at the moment where a hook is needed. On ""Girl
    That Speaks No Words"", Bnann's sing-song verse flirts with catchiness only
    to abruptly hit the brakes before the track's anti-climactic chorus of
    ooh's and ah's. ""Murder That Sound"" hits a similar snag, investing heavily
    on its choppy Human League-style build only to plateau and retreat back
    into less-than-intriguing sci-fi ambience.</p><p>
    
    While spotty hooks occasionally bail out the Infadels' creative palsy, the
    album's more proactive numbers only add insult to this injury. ""Reality
    TV"" barks more than bites, with Bnann sardonically tossing out Social
    Commentary 101 lyrics like ""the people on the screen are your family now""
    and ""I wanna see people huggin' and kissin'."" Similarly, opener ""Love Like
    Semtex"" should come across as a call to arms, but instead it stumbles on a
    lifeless groove, a veritable dud for a song about explosives and sex.
    Track after track similar problems arise, and the album never lives up
    to its edgy/party surface. At the end of the night, the Infadels'
    promising shindig serves more sliced vegetables and Kool-Aid than pretzels
    and beer, and judging by the album's conservative creativity, the band's parents
    were invited, too.</p></div>"|4169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4169-we-are-not-the-infadels/|5.2|Adam Moerder

It's a terrible scene, didactic and awkward. But it's interesting that he'd mention ""Back That Azz Up"", considering that Juvenile, the guy who made that track, has the bluesiest voice in rap (apologies to Trick Daddy): a weary singsong swamp-growl, all drawn-out half-swallowed vowels and rasping New Orleans Creole wavers. And now that acts of God and governmental neglect have effectively leveled Juvenile's hometown, that voice has a tragic context.</p><p>
<em>Reality Check</em>, Juvenile's seventh album, opens with ""Get Ya Hustle On"", a Hurricane Katrina diatribe as broken and confused as it is enraged. Over chilly harpsichord plinks and foghorn bass, he seesaws wildly between political invective (""Fuck Fox News; I don't listen to y'all ass/ Couldn't get a nigga off the roof when the storm passed"") and crack-dealer bluster (""Get ya mind right, nigga, get ya money up/ You're moving a little something, but you ain't done enough""). With this one track, Juvenile throws the past year's rampant trap-rap trend into shockingly sharp relief; how fatalistic must you be to advocate drug-dealing for post-hurricane recovery?</p><p>
    
    Nothing else on <em>Reality Check</em> references Hurricane Katrina directly, but ""Get Ya Hustle On"" puts the rest of the album in a weird light. On ""Sets Go Up"", the album's best song, Juvenile snarls hometown pride over Scott Storch's masterfully spacey drums and synth-bleeps: ""New Orleans, see I'ma rep that cause these my peeps/ You could pick up some bad habits hangin' in these streets."" But then, in Southern rap, it's not so much about what you say as how you say it, and so on ""Rodeo"", the bleakly guttural moans and gorgeously fragile Cool &amp; Dre track resonate far more than the track's straight-ignorant strip-club lyrics. </p><p>
    
    For all its fatalism, though, <em>Reality Check</em> is still a commercial Southern rap album, and it has certain obligations to fulfill as such, so it has a few songs about butts and cough syrup, and a small army of rappers making guest appearances and plenty of threats to kill you. On its own merits, it's pretty great. Many of the beats come from the relative unknown Sinista, whose muffled drum thumps, streaky organs, and prim synth-whistles give the album a bright, warm cohesion; this stuff is only going to sound better when summer arrives. Most of the guests acquit themselves well, especially Skip, a member of Juve's new U.T.P. clique who raps in an self-aggrandizing nasal bark, something like Dave Chappelle's Rick James voice. At more than an hour, the album is too long; it would be much better without a few of its second-half tracks, especially the garbage Brian McKnight collaboration ""Addicted"". <em>Reality Check</em> never quite transcends its genre, but Juvenile's resonant sadness always sets it apart. The album's closing track ""Say It to Me Now"" may be a dis against Juvenile's former fellow Hot Boy Lil Wayne, but it's more despondent than it is angry; not many beef songs end with anguished conversations with God.</p></div>"|4368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4368-reality-check/|7.9|Tom Breihan

With its 2003 full-length debut, the Brooklyn-based trio confidently staked out diverse territory-- from the meltdown-rock of ""Pin"" to the march of ""Black Tongue"" to the tenderly skewed balladry of ""Maps""-- and played those extremes against each other, so that each became even more extreme in contrast.  The result was a complex sound that was simultaneously inviting and confrontational, and it made <em>Fever to Tell</em> this decade's gold standard for transcending indie hype.  But while it makes sense for the YYYs to play off that earlier sound here, their new album sounds like only one side of a multifaceted band.</i></p><p>
    
    For <em>Bones</em>, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs recruited producer Squeak E. Clean, who fits these songs with an array of bells and whistles-- not to mention sirens, organs, programmed beats, acoustic guitars, rattling percussion, keyboards, and various studio effects.  Most of it, unfortunately, simply seems unnecessary or excessive.  In fact, more often than not, these sonic geegaws detract from the band's intensity, compartmentalizing the record's explosive moments from the songs themselves.</p><p>
    
    Nick Zinner's guitar sounds smaller and less commanding here, and Karen O has toned down her presence considerably, rarely relying on the vocal tics that once seemed the equivalent of her famously ragtag glam fashion. Even when she unleashes that hellfire growl in ""Fancy"", it's buried so far in the mix that it's indistinguishable from the band's racket. Brian Chase's drum work remains confoundingly intricate, but seems strangely restrained nonetheless.  The percussion should punish your eardrums when he pounds out the opening of ""Fancy""; instead it sounds polite, like he's clearing his throat to get your attention.  When the Yeah Yeah Yeahs finally do cut loose at the frenzied end of the Strokes-fest ""Mysteries"", the moment has a get-it-all-out-now feel.</p><p>
    
    These are growing pains for a band that has done a lot of maturing since <em>Fever to Tell</em> made them semistars. This newfound wisdom has its benefits, chief among them a confessional tone to the songwriting that effectively blurs the distinctions between Karen O and Karen Orzalek. <em>Show Your Bones</em> is a post-fame album, with many songs written from the specific perspective of a touring musician. ""Warrior"" begins as an acoustic ballad much like the previous album's ""Modern Romance"", but builds linearly to an intense finish as Karen O laments, ""Travel away, travel it all away/ The road's gonna end on me."" She never lapses into self-pity, though, mainly because the attraction of an excited audience proves as strong as the pull of a stable, homebound life. First single ""Gold Lion"" sounds like a mission statement: ""We'll build a fire in your eyes.""</p><p>
    
    For its faults, howeveer, <em>Show Your Bones</em> contains some genuinely disarming moments that reveal the band's considerable emotional and sonic force. Despite its similarity to Love and Rockets' ""No New Tale to Tell"", ""Gold Lion"" unleashes a booming wordless chorus and a high-flying guitar riff from Zinner. On ""Way Out""-- perhaps the album's most effectively dramatic track-- O infuses her vocals with a palpable emotional fatigue, sounding desperate to reconnect with the world even as she slowly sinks into numbness: ""It's around me so tight!""</p><p>
    
    Still, on <em>Show Your Bones</em> the Yeah Yeah Yeahs occupy only one corner of the territory they claimed on <i>Fever, walking confidently in their own footsteps but without claiming any new ground.  If <em>Fever</em> had a skuzzy film of sweat and alcohol that sounded persuasively real, with songs that could have been cobbled together from scraps found in garbage bins and dumpsters, unmade beds and mess-strewn rooms, </i><i>Bones possesses a too-clean sound and a songwriterly approach that seems more redolent of the studio than the stage. These refinements, which prove merely cosmetic, sap their sound of its brutal spontaneity and mute the band members' idiosyncrasies, and as a result, the album sounds guarded, with very little danger and too few moments of real urgency.</i></p></div>"|8889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8889-show-your-bones/|6.8|Stephen M.

    After listening to <em>In Colour</em>, I wasn't sure if I ever liked the Concretes. The album is noticeably different from their previous material:
    shambling rhythms are tightened, the Velvets-meets-Motown sway of
    their eponymous 2004 LP is replaced with an Elton-meets-Lilith piano-led pounce, and the band's former psych-tinged production now sounds as
    uncluttered as an empty apartment.</p><p>
    The Swedish octet was always blatantly commune-ish-- organic
    tomatoes and homespun sweaters all the way-- but the free love was
    usually tempered by deep, vulnerable heartbreak that broke through such
    peaceful vibes. The band's best song to date, ""Say Something New"" from
    <em>The Concretes</em>, details the apparent awkward last words of a
    relationship; we never learn the exact utterance, but we know the
    crushed receiver wants to hear something-- anything-- else. On <em>In Colour</em> that kind
    of shrouded hurt is wiped away by lyrics that consistently reach
    inexcusable levels of banality along with a new sound concocted with the help
    of usually reliable Bright Eyes multi-tasker Mike Mogis that squeezes
    out the group's groove. What's left is toothless Sunday morning schmaltz.</p><p>
    Bouncing forth with the permanent-smile major-chord plunks of opener
    ""On the Radio"", these troubadours flip their hand
    straight off. Streamlined to hell, it's still a technical wonder with
    the group's myriad voices finding a distinct home within the mix. But
    the collective effect is lessened, no matter how pristinely it floats
    from the speakers. Nico-esque lead singer Victoria Bergsman doesn't
    sound as enticing inside the pretty sonic paradise either, her naïve
    quivers neutralized and smoothed out. It's too much, too content, too
    polite-- and ""On the Radio"" is one of the better tracks on the
    record.</p><p>
    Way worse is the queasy break-up duet featuring Concrete Lisa Milberg and lead Magic Number Romeo Stodart. ""I call, you hang up"" goes the
    hook between the two. The bogged-down instrumentation
    and simplistic sentiment somehow comes off like a screwed take on
    ""Puff the Magic Dragon"", which, although admittedly intriguing, is
    ultimately unlistenable. Meanwhile, another decrepit snail of a song,
    ""Tomorrow"", doesn't even last four minutes but-- with its echoes of
    <em>Annie</em> and an endless muted trumpet passage that stagnates like
    rotten garlic-- seems to drag on for hours.</p><p>
    Almost everything that was unique and compelling about the Concretes-- including the
    faux-country sashay, the Diana Ross worship, and the willful wobble-- is
    pitifully underrepresented on <em>In Colour</em>. Before, it seemed like
    these beautiful free spirits were just cranking out great happy-sad songs, one
    of which happened to sneak into a Target commercial. Now it seems like
    they're trying to make music for a Target commercial.</p></div>"|1573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1573-in-colour/|4.7|Ryan Dombal

He wants you to love it, too; so much that he backs himself up and ad-libs on ""Four Leaf Clover"", creates a well of harmonies on ""Fashionably Uninvited"", and becomes a deranged doo-wop group on ""Madison"". You have to be comfortable with your voice to make a bedroom pop record, and Bates is the principal player and songwriter of Mellowdrone, who's been recording for years before releasing <em>Box</em>, his band's debut LP. Many one-man wonders have streamlined their quirks (Beck, Nine Inch Nails) or just disappeared by now (Self, anyone?), but Bates' smash-and-grab attitude towards genre finds a middle ground between indie and more radio-oriented modern rock, tossing small scraps to both camps.</p><p>
<em>Box</em> is a collection of sorts, borrowing four of the strongest songs from Mellowdrone's earlier EPs. The new tracks are just as bold: ""Oh My"" contrasts a perky strum and casual, slurred singing with aggressive beats and jagged guitars that would fit snugly on the latest Nine Inch Nails record, and ""Four Leaf Clover"" smears <em>Twin Peaks</em> synthesizers over looped acoustic guitars and lazy funk bass.</p><p>
    
    Not every New-NIN, Depeche Mode-dabbler counts Angelo Badalamenti as an influence, and ""Fashionably Uninvited"", borrowed from an ealier EP, reaps the greatest returns. A little more ethereal and less blubbery then its older counterpart, the gentle bass-and-brushes opening beat imperceptibly slows time, while Bates' lilting vocals follow a tentative piano line that wades through like Fred Astaire pirouetting through the Walkmen's studio. Moments like that are enough to forgive-- indulge, even-- the swirling Alice In Chains-style vocals in the chorus. Elsewhere, the aggressive ranting/singing on ""Beautiful Day"" becomes even more paranoid with the open space of the recording. Bates' vocals have gone from impudent and angsty to a more confident croon; the big yell that comes later on ""Madison"" would make Julian Casablancas red with envy (as opposed to red from straining to hit notes).</p><p>
     
    While the first half comes on strong with the sleek, aggressive would-be hits, the second shows their sensitive side: the coy seductive pulse ""Orange Marmalade"", the self-serving pep talk over suffocating bass on ""Madison"", the pleading of ""Bone Marrow"", or the baroque electronic death wish of ""Limb to Limb"". It adds depth and variety to <em>Box</em>, but it's also a struggle between identities-- Bates sounds like he wants it both ways, flipping the switch between introverted and invincible at will. Both are played with equal conviction, but it's the more wistful side of Mellowdrone that comes more naturally, and brings some ambiguity when those songs get the subtler, more seductive beats. Tracks like ""Oh My"" simply flash their goods. If it's the eager-to-please first half of <em>Box</em> that garners more fans for the band, I couldn't fault them for being as melodic and having a better sense of atmosphere than their alt-rock contemporaries.</p></div>"|5681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5681-box/|6.8|Jason Crock

Traditional voices are pared down to sound bites. Organic musical systems harden into petrified tropes. Whole historical epochs resurface as hermetic genre exercises. Is there anything insidious about this flattened view of history? Are some historical moments still too emotionally raw and politically relevant to be casually appropriated, and where do we draw the line? Two Gallants beg these and other questions on their sophomore LP.</p><p>
<em>What the Toll Tells</em> appropriates Southern trad-Americana, from bitterly class-conscious folk to vibrantly violent outlaw country, and runs it through an emo-punk filter. The long compositions are modernized with the sort of croaky vocals and spiky guitars familiar from Bright Eyes and Cursive. The album opens with its strongest track, ""Las Cruces Jail"". Lonesome whistles set the scene for this yowling cow-punk stomper. Adam Stephens locates a strong vocal melody for his jailhouse lament, as he does on the acoustic dirge ""Steady Rollin'"". But the quixotic charm wears thin as ""Some Slender Rest"" dips into lugubrious emo-folk, and the remainder of the album's murdered wives, enraged sheriffs, and luckless roustabouts pile up cartoonishly.</p><p> 
    We've become anesthetized to morally murkier areas of rose-tinted Southern clichés, the same way that many of us can uneasily suspend judgment when listening to certain hip-hop music. But such rap is always, to some degree, responding to lived or shared experience. Two Gallants are borrowing otherness, which raises the stakes significantly. The nagging discomfort we're so good at ignoring when we listen to music that handles history like costume jewelry is thrown into stark relief by ""Long Summer Day"", a reworking of Moses ""Clear Water"" Platt's scathing work song (Platt's original is included on <em>Deep River of Song: Black Texicans</em>, which collects Alan Lomax's 1930s field-recordings of African-American music on the Texas frontier). </p><p> 
    I want to believe that Two Gallants had good intentions in covering this song. But intention is fleeting; if it ever becomes known to the public, it's quickly dispatched to the mists of time. Only the artifact remains. And this artifact scans to me as deeply insensitive and offensive. Spin.com brushed it off as an account of racism; occasional Pitchfork contributor Jonathan Zwickel hailed it as ""nothing short of revelatory"" in <em>New Times</em>. But what value is there in an account of racism from people who've never stared down its barrel? What could it possibly reveal? If these myopic responses reveal anything, it's that the topic is much easier to gloss over than to actually discuss. Such an inflammatory project needs a complex intellectual purpose to make it more than a cheap provocation. This rigor doesn't come through in the cover, and when a <em>Drowned in Sound</em> interviewer pressed Stephens on the topic of ""Long Summer Day"", he equivocated. ""I don't think it comes as something strategic,"" he said, and the interviewer demurred, because he was ""in no mood"" to really broach the topic. </p><p> 
    In the same interview, Two Gallants repeatedly complain about critics not ""getting them."" But a persistent failure of interpretation usually signals an initial failure of expression. The critic's job isn't to explore what an artist was trying to do, but what they've actually done. And this is it: A couple of white, twentysomething San Franciscans singing, ""the summer day makes a nigga feel crazy,"" a line destined to be belted out by carfulls of indie kids at the top of their ironic lungs. Is this healing? You decide. </p></div>"|8262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8262-what-the-toll-tells/|4.8|Brian Howe

Despite Brian Wilson's audacious-- even in an era remembered for its spiritual ambitions (and hang-ups)-- claim for <i>Pet Sounds</i>, his phrase has gone the way of most sound bites: It's become clichéd and almost meaningless. Yet, the music is hardly affected by this claim. If anything, it overshadows it; songs like ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"" and ""God Only Knows"" seem so far beyond the realm of ""teenage,"" I wonder if others who might have wanted to make sure Wilson's band always had a place on the radio influenced his characterization of his own stuff. In any case, he only sporadically approached the divine thereafter. In fact, few pop artists of any stripe have come as close to writing modern day hymns like Wilson's in the mid-1960s.</p>
<p>Judee Sill was a California girl. Like Wilson, she had a troubled family; the tragic death of her father while she was still a child, and the death of her brother soon afterward left her permanently scarred-- and her mother's alcoholism left Sill practically rootless. Rootless, that is, except for an almost feverish mystic-religious bent, inspiring the likewise artistically minded Sill to write several songs directly related to Christ-like figures or otherwise heavenly phenomena. After surviving a heroin addiction and a brief stint as a bank robber, Sill turned her rather intense passions to music. In the late-60s, after having been introduced to a fertile L.A. songwriter community by her then-husband (and future record producer) Bob Harris, she began writing songs for other acts, including penning the Turtles' single ""Lady O"". After up-and-coming record mogul David Geffen spotted her playing sets at various Hollywood clubs, he offered her a publishing deal, and eventually signed her to his own newly formed Asylum Records.</p>
<p>Sill's music was complex, elegantly crafted and yet completely devoid of pretension or overwrought melodrama. Often accompanying her clear, unmannered voice with just her acoustic guitar, Sill made music that seemed more suited to a small chapel than onstage at a club. Unfairly lumped in with other female, proto-adult contemporary songwriters like Joni Mitchell or Carole King, Sill was much closer in spirit to Brian Wilson, Nick Drake, or one her idols, J.S. Bach. She had a gift for making very complicated things sound simple, beautiful. Often, her arrangements took advantage of a chamber orchestra or layers of vocal harmonies, and rather than seeming pumped full of grandeur, they were tiny miracles of poetic efficiency. Her modest Southern drawl-- an affectation shared by many of her SoCal contemporaries-- is the only thing that dates her songs at all, and Water's reissue of her first two LPs (coming a year after Rhino's limited reissues) should find Sill ready acceptance by almost anyone into gentle, heart-lifting music.</p>
<p>1971's <i>Judee Sill</i> begins unobtrusively with Sill's buoyant, finger-picked guitar and her declaration that ""nothing's happened, but I think it will soon/ So I sit here waiting for God and a train to the Astral plane."" She was very fond of mystic imagery (not to mention astrology), but the simple beauty of her music tended to keep the songs from floating off into the ether. She further evokes the supernatural in ""Lopin' Along Thru the Cosmos"", ""The Lamb Ran Away With the Crown"", and the gospel-tinged ""Enchanted Sky Machines"", though the only song to actually namecheck a religious figure is curiously enough not a religious song at all. ""Jesus Was a Cross Maker"" was the hit that should have been. Produced by Graham Nash, and featuring one of Sill's best lyrics-- detailing her betrayal by a former partner (in fact, fellow L.A. songwriter J.D. Souther), and using the song's title as an indication that even the people we loved the most had the ability to let us down-- the song begins as understated piano ballad. The chord progressions would have made Wilson smile, and when the chorus hits-- female chorus of background harmonies and full band lifting things off the ground-- I'm hard pressed to think of a more uplifting piece of music.</p>
<p>And then I heard ""The Kiss"" from 1973's <i>Heart Food. If ever there was a song that lived up to the glorious, simultaneous heartbreaking and mending I might expect from a symphony to God, it's this. Sill once again plays piano (and in fact did all the orchestral and vocal arrangements herself), using another unbelievably gorgeous chord progression, taking advantage of pedal notes and resolving cadences in much the same way as Bach did, and uses her lone, double-tracked vocal to deliver a melody that arrests me no matter how many times I hear it. A sampling of Sill's words-- ""Promise me this and only this/ Holy breath touching me/ Like a wind song / Sweet communion of a kiss""-- reveal someone obviously enamored of the beyond, of the archetypical bridegroom who was at once the songwriter's savior and father, and abandoned husband. I might add that I'm not religious in the slightest, but think it would take an almost total lack of sprit not to be moved by this stuff.</i></p>
<p>Though it would be tough to top something like ""The Kiss"", the remainder of <i>Heart Food</i> is almost as good. Tracks like the up-tempo ""Soldier of a Heart"" (another hit that never was) or ""The Pearl"" demonstrate Sill's seeming proximity to people like Linda Rondstadt, though she could hardly have fit less comfortably into the pop-star's mold-- in fact, she refused to play live if forced to open for other acts, which meant she basically stopped playing live altogether. No matter, as her multi-layered, album-ending opus ""The Donor"" indicates, Sill shone plenty brightly in the studio. The comparatively epic-length of the track (just over eight minutes) is filled to the brim with vocal harmonies, including male voices in the distance, and a cyclical chord sequence shimmering via piano, bells and timpani. If you listen close, you can hear the voices chanting in Latin, and when they commiserate in unison at ""kyrie eleison,"" I'm again stopped dead in my tracks.</p>
<p>Sill never released anything else. She'd begun recording another record (the unfortunately underwhelming results of which have been released on a 2xCD compilation <i>Dreams Come True</i>), but by the mid-70s had resumed her heroin habit and dropped almost completely off the music landscape. She died of an overdose in 1979 and such was the degree of her professional disappearance, it's rumored that it took a year for the news to filter to her onetime patron Geffen. Nevertheless, her gifts survived. As with the music of Wilson or Bach, it's hard to suppress the inner light of Sill's work. It shines.</p></div>"|11844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11844-judee-sill-heart-food/|8.7|Dominique Leone

She had a gift for making very complicated things sound simple, beautiful. Often, her arrangements took advantage of a chamber orchestra or layers of vocal harmonies, and rather than seeming pumped full of grandeur, they were tiny miracles of poetic efficiency. Her modest Southern drawl-- an affectation shared by many of her SoCal contemporaries-- is the only thing that dates her songs at all, and Water's reissue of her first two LPs (coming a year after Rhino's limited reissues) should find Sill ready acceptance by almost anyone into gentle, heart-lifting music.</p>
<p>1971's <i>Judee Sill</i> begins unobtrusively with Sill's buoyant, finger-picked guitar and her declaration that ""nothing's happened, but I think it will soon/ So I sit here waiting for God and a train to the Astral plane."" She was very fond of mystic imagery (not to mention astrology), but the simple beauty of her music tended to keep the songs from floating off into the ether. She further evokes the supernatural in ""Lopin' Along Thru the Cosmos"", ""The Lamb Ran Away With the Crown"", and the gospel-tinged ""Enchanted Sky Machines"", though the only song to actually namecheck a religious figure is curiously enough not a religious song at all. ""Jesus Was a Cross Maker"" was the hit that should have been. Produced by Graham Nash, and featuring one of Sill's best lyrics-- detailing her betrayal by a former partner (in fact, fellow L.A. songwriter J.D. Souther), and using the song's title as an indication that even the people we loved the most had the ability to let us down-- the song begins as understated piano ballad. The chord progressions would have made Wilson smile, and when the chorus hits-- female chorus of background harmonies and full band lifting things off the ground-- I'm hard pressed to think of a more uplifting piece of music.</p>
<p>And then I heard ""The Kiss"" from 1973's <i>Heart Food. If ever there was a song that lived up to the glorious, simultaneous heartbreaking and mending I might expect from a symphony to God, it's this. Sill once again plays piano (and in fact did all the orchestral and vocal arrangements herself), using another unbelievably gorgeous chord progression, taking advantage of pedal notes and resolving cadences in much the same way as Bach did, and uses her lone, double-tracked vocal to deliver a melody that arrests me no matter how many times I hear it. A sampling of Sill's words-- ""Promise me this and only this/ Holy breath touching me/ Like a wind song / Sweet communion of a kiss""-- reveal someone obviously enamored of the beyond, of the archetypical bridegroom who was at once the songwriter's savior and father, and abandoned husband. I might add that I'm not religious in the slightest, but think it would take an almost total lack of sprit not to be moved by this stuff.</i></p>
<p>Though it would be tough to top something like ""The Kiss"", the remainder of <i>Heart Food</i> is almost as good. Tracks like the up-tempo ""Soldier of a Heart"" (another hit that never was) or ""The Pearl"" demonstrate Sill's seeming proximity to people like Linda Rondstadt, though she could hardly have fit less comfortably into the pop-star's mold-- in fact, she refused to play live if forced to open for other acts, which meant she basically stopped playing live altogether. No matter, as her multi-layered, album-ending opus ""The Donor"" indicates, Sill shone plenty brightly in the studio. The comparatively epic-length of the track (just over eight minutes) is filled to the brim with vocal harmonies, including male voices in the distance, and a cyclical chord sequence shimmering via piano, bells and timpani. If you listen close, you can hear the voices chanting in Latin, and when they commiserate in unison at ""kyrie eleison,"" I'm again stopped dead in my tracks.</p>
<p>Sill never released anything else. She'd begun recording another record (the unfortunately underwhelming results of which have been released on a 2xCD compilation <i>Dreams Come True</i>), but by the mid-70s had resumed her heroin habit and dropped almost completely off the music landscape. She died of an overdose in 1979 and such was the degree of her professional disappearance, it's rumored that it took a year for the news to filter to her onetime patron Geffen. Nevertheless, her gifts survived. As with the music of Wilson or Bach, it's hard to suppress the inner light of Sill's work. It shines.</p></div>"|11844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11844-judee-sill-heart-food/|8.8|Dominique Leone

""I find that more often, on the contrary, it is the music and the lyric that trigger the emotion within me rather than the other way around."" Maybe because it's so obviously the product of trial-and-error experimentation, <em>Bush of Ghosts</em> sounded like a quirky side project on its release in 1981; heck, it didn't even have any ""songs."" But today, Nonesuch has repackaged it as a near-masterpiece, a milestone of sampled music, and a peace summit in the continual West-meets-rest struggle. So we're supposed to see <em>Bush of Ghosts as a tick on the timeline of important transgressive records.</em></p><p>
     
    It mostly holds up to that scrutiny. An album that's built on serendipity-- on Brian Eno fooling around with a new type of drum machine, on syncing the hook in a tape loop to a chorus, on finding the right horrors on the radio-- can't score 100%. But even if you cut it some slack, crucial parts of the album don't sound as intriguing today as they once did-- namely, all of the voices.</p><p>
     
    The sampled speech from various, mainly religious, sources ties the album into a long and prestigious history of artists who used found sound, which David Toop capably outlines in the liner notes. It's still the secret sauce that provokes a reaction from the listener. But what reaction you have lies outside of Byrne's, Eno's, or your control. On the first half, where the voices are least chopped up, it's difficult to divorce them from their origins. A couple of tracks read as satire-- ""America Is Waiting"" sounds like Negativland with a way better rhythm section-- and others as kitsch. ""Help Me Somebody"" pulls a neat trick by turning a preacher into an r&amp;b; singer, but the exorcist on ""The Jezebel Spirit"" doesn't raise as many hairs on the back of my neck now that taping a crazy evangelist has become the art music equivalent of broadcasting crank phone calls. We can't just hear them for their sound or cadences without digging into the meanings, and not everyone will find the meanings profound.</p><p> 
    
    On the other hand, the rhythm tracks still kick ass 10 ways to Sunday, thanks both to the fly-by apperances of Bill Laswell, Chris Frantz, Prairie Prince, and a half dozen others, and to the inspired messing about of Eno and Byrne as they turned boxes and food tins into percussion. Tape loops are funkier than laptops, and the modern ear is so aware of the digital ""noodging"" of a sample to a beat that the refreshingly knocked-together arrangements of <em>Bush of Ghosts</em> are a vast improvement. At one stage of the project, they dreamed about documenting the music of a fake foreign culture. They largely pulled it off, and you can tell a lot about this far-off place from its music: It's a futuristic yet tribal town made of resonant sheets of metal and amplified plastic containers, that the populace has to bang constantly in perfect time to make the traffic move, and the stoves heat up, and the lights flicker on at night, and to coax mismatched couples into making love and breeding new percussionists.</p><p>
     
    The seven bonus tracks will provoke more arguments than they settle. The setlist of <em>Bush of Ghosts</em> has changed several times over the years, and the diehard fans will still have to swap left-out cuts that aren't resurrected here; most famously, ""Qu'ran"", an apparently sacreligious recording of Koran verses set to music, doesn't get anywhere near this reissue. The songs that are here include a few that sound almost finished, including ""Pitch to Voltage"", and others that would fit almost as well as anything in the second half of the disc. The last cut, ""Solo Guitar with Tin Foil"", features someone, presumably Byrne, playing a haunting tune on a guitar with an impossibly clean tone-- a fitting end to an album that, for all its transcontinental fingerprints, sounds strikingly free of impurities.</p><p> 
     
    Though <em>Bush of Ghosts</em> was a link in the chain between Steve Reich and the Bomb Squad, I'm not convinced that this talking point helps us enjoy the album. However, Nonesuch made an interesting move that could help Bush of Ghosts make history all over again: they launched a ""remix"" website, at <u><a href=""http://www.bush-of-ghosts.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bush-of-ghosts.com</a></u>, where any of us can download multitracked versions of two songs, load them up in the editor of our choice, and under a Creative Commons license, do whatever we want with them.</p><p>
     
    As I write this, the site hasn't launched, and even if it were up, I can't tell how lively its community will be, how edgy the remixers can get, and how many rules will pen them in. Nonesuch copped out by posting only part of the album, instead of every piece of tape they owned, and I suspect that the bush-of-ghosts.com site may just be a corporate sandbox for wannabe remixers. But I could be wrong; I haven't tried to submit my mash-up of ""Qu'ran"" and Denmark's National Anthem yet. What matters is that they started the site and released these tracks, and by doing so, they put a stake in the ground-- not the first one, but an important one-- for Creative Commons licensing, Web 2.0 album releases (""this is an album where you participate!""), and the culture of remixing.</p><p> 
     
    And by handing over their multitracks, Byrne and Eno also make a powerful acknowledgement of their own helplessness. It is a basic but real fact of our time that sampling can work both ways. In the 80s, you could fairly make an argument that Byrne and Eno were the Western white men appropriating all kinds of Others, be they domestic and primitive, or foreign and exotic. Now the world can return the favor: Anyone can rip this work apart and use it any way they please, and you can bet that if some kid in the Third World sends a killer remix to the right blogger, it'll travel faster and farther than this carefully curated reissue. Byrne and Eno counted on a certain amount of serendipity in their studio; today, they can witness the serendipity of what happens to their killer rhythm tracks-- the ones they released, and all the others that people will use anyway. And the strongest message they could send is not only that they've relinquished control, but that they admit they already lost it-- whether they like it or not.</p></div>"|1064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1064-my-life-in-the-bush-of-ghosts/|8.5|Chris Dahlen

Talk about a genre that produces a lot of unmemorable drivel: From the last few years, its standout records are either not really lap-pop (Octet's Cali-pop-smitten <em>Cash and Carry Songs</em>) or just exceptionally bad (Styrofoam's Linkin Park-smitten <em>Nothing's Lost</em>). But <em>No P. or D.</em> was different. It had happy hooks and melancholy hooks and lush quasi-acoustic instrumentation, and it sounded just as good on a sunny day as on a rainy reflective one. The German duo of Stephanie Böhm and Micha Acher (the Notwist) substituted layered melodies for stacks of blippy folderol, creating a record free of the superfluous electronic baggage and nonessential sounds this stuff often swims in.</p><p>
    Four years on, Ms. John Soda haven't gone less digital, even if the novelty of having a glitch-ridden beat behind a pop hook has simmered down a bit. ""A Nod on Hold"" coruscates with textural arpeggios, which were cool before the Postal Service abused them like chow mein does cornstarch. The song wouldn't necessarily be better or worse without such a commonplace, but its predominance in the mix suggests a few things: (1) Lack of confidence. How can anyone think one-touch chattering-machine FX are still a good idea unless trying to dress an anorexic song? The track isn't even that bad, just a little depressive, and the padding is unnecessary. (2) Growing disenchantment. ""A Nod on Hold"" is what I call the rise-and-shine lullaby. Standard fare for many lap-pop records, these gauzy overtures carry an air of foreboding, which makes them ideal as introductions. But they also serve as tranquilizers, drawing listeners into a dreamy, incubated headspace. ""A Nod on Hold"" is too tremulous to occupy this role; it leans on quavery strings where it needs a sure-footed hook. (3) A duo running low on ideas. The track would've probably missed the cut for <em>No P. or D.</em>, a scant eight-song package whose weakest cuts were much fleshier than this; on <em>Notes and the Like</em> it's the opening track.</p><p>
    Looking a little sallow this time out, Ms. John Soda can ill-afford to wax so melancholic. ""A Million Times"" calls back the quavery strings, this time pushed further up in the mix against a milquetoast beat. Only Böhm's wispy, serene vocal redeems the thing from total flaccidity-- she sounds sad, but at peace. At times she seems to want to quit singing entirely, content to run off motorik verses in a blindfolded monotone. On ""Scan the Ways"", the album's best song, this works; over driving guitar-and-bass eighths speckled with nice-enough flourishes-- flute flits and harpsichord-sounding incandescences-- her drone is more urbane than mundane. It's no surprise her style works best when she's resigned, as opposed to downtrodden. But in lieu of <em>No P. or D.</em>'s deep textures, we're left with the blippy folderol. <em>Notes and the Like</em> is par-for-the-course lap-pop, and that could well be the point. But as someone who has long understood lap-pop to be the Switzerland of genres-- a neutral aesthetic baseplane artists must activate with things like melody and surprises-- I find that hard to understand and even harder to believe.</p></div>"|5487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5487-notes-and-the-like/|5.4|Sam Ubl

    Even the occasional breakout commercial successes-- Folk Implosion,
    the Postal Service-- never quite earn the critical props proffered to
    their progenitors. Maybe the neophilic indie kids cultivating a taste
    for electronic crossovers can't win friends with records linked to
    veteran guitar acts (nor, sadly, with salad). Acid Casuals may count
    Super Furry Animals keyboardist Cian Ciárán among their members, but
    <em>Omni</em> shouldn't be consigned to the synth-based novelty
    scrapheap alongside, say, the Album Leaf or 1997 Claptronica excursion
    TDF.</p><p>
    While <em>Omni</em> could be seen as merely SFA's ""lost"" techno album,
    its ambient, melodic near-instrumentals deserve to succeed on their
    own merits. Each track's songy enough to leapfrog Isolée and layered
    enough for bobbins, analogue-bent entirety conjuring what
    <em>Analord</em> might've been. The languid Dennis Wilson pacing from
    Ciárán's <em>Love Kraft</em> contributions washes over the electronic
    weirdness found in <em>Guerilla</em>-era tracks like ""Some Things Comes From
    Nothing"". Gorgeous lead single ""Bowl Me Over"" is <em>Omni</em>'s only
    conventional pop song, cooing doo-wop romance like a stoned
    sentimentalist's take on ""Something 4 the Weekend""-- still SFA's most
    immediate tune.</p><p>
    The album's other tracks rely mostly on nonsense vocals, such as the
    jazzy, Cornelius-kooky ""Wa Da Da"", harmony-drenched ""Y Ferch Ar Y Cei
    Yn Rio"", or waltzing ""Kraken"", which features an operatic female voice
    that explains Ciárán's choice of Bizet's ""Pearl Fishers"" for last
    year's <em>Under the Influence</em> compilation. Chiming, slightly
    dissonant opener ""If I'm a Selt, You're a Sunt"" tags near Caribou
    territory, while penultimate ""Luciano"" licks high-pitched synth tones
    from <em>Mwng</em>'s ""'Dacw Hi"" before lounging in hot-Air
    orchestration.</p><p>
    So call it one small blip for SFA, one enormously satisfying listen
    for 2006. Like Gruff Rhys on his 2005 solo album <em>Yr Atal
    Genhedlaeth</em> or, hopefully, Dafydd Ieuan's bilingual rock group the
    Peth, Ciárán and co-Casual Kev Tame (former bassist for Welsh-language
    pop group Big Leaves) have created a side project work that would
    stand as a career highlight for many of their peers. If you're one of
    those neophilic indie kids, just pretend they're German
    twentysomethings.</p></div>"|502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/502-omni/|7.8|Marc Hogan

As with many of her folk-rock contemporaries, Simonds has been long absent from the recording scene but has seen a recent surge of interest in her earlier work, as exemplified by Stephen Malkmus' 2003 cover of Mellow Candle's ""Poet &amp; the Witch"".</p><p>
    
    Intriguing though it's been, however, there's nothing in Simonds' past history that could've adequately foretold the remarkable appearance of her new project, Fovea Hex. Featuring contributions from such heavyweights as Brian and Roger Eno, the Hafler Trio's Andrew McKenzie, and film composer Carter Burwell, Fovea Hex represents a startling confluence of talents and styles, and the group's first release is uniquely possessed of an icy, sapphire-like radiance. This three-song EP is the first installment of a proposed trilogy entitled <em>Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent</em> and brief though it is, the record exhibits a sterling assortment of ambient, high-density drones, all of which are subtly bound by Simonds' songcraft and crystalline, folk-derived vocals.</p><p>
    
    Assembled and mixed by McKenzie via a ghostly construction of harmonium, viola, zither, and ""disappeared piano,"" the deceptively active arrangements achieve a frosty mood somewhere relative to Nico's <em>The Marble Index</em>, Current 93's apocalyptic folk-drones, and the unflinching winterscapes of Burwell's <em>Fargo</em> soundtrack. But despite Fovea Hex's assembled instrumental firepower, Simonds unquestionably emerges as the central figure on these performances-- particularly on the near-acappella opening track ""Don't These Windows Open"". Conducted by McKenzie's invisible hand, here Simonds' multi-tracked chorale is as gracefully split and clarified as sunlight mirrored off the polar icecaps.</p><p>
    
    Yet though all appears tranquil on the surface, on <em>Bloom</em> there are unseen forces at constant work to undercut Simonds' lyrics with ripples of doubt and anxiety. ""Cry for your father/ Don't these windows open?/ How could he hear us?"" she fervently sings on this first track, sounding determined not to lose her cool in a crisis. Later on, amid the gorgeous dunes of ""We Sleep You Bloom"", she again conjures indistinct external spirits, ""Way down beneath the battlefield/ Down there beside the fire...as we sleep you bloom,"" leaving ambiguous the nature of these unnamed forces that ""bloom in a petrol rainbow dark."" And throughout these performances, Simonds tempers her passions with an elegant measure of stoic restraint, aided by the exceptional vocal harmonies of Brian Eno, Laura Sheeran, and Lydia Sasse.</p><p>
    
    So potent, in fact, are Fovea Hex's joint creations that the album's brevity becomes its primary drawback. Simonds has a voice that one could happily drown in for hours, and obviously guys like McKenzie, Burwell, and the Enos would benefit from further opportunity to stretch their collaborative limits. So it's good news to learn that the next chapter in the <em>Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent</em> series is due later this spring, and a minor impatience to anticipate the day when the entire work is available to be absorbed as a whole.</p></div>"|3362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3362-bloom-ep/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

Some people want to live forever; others know all too well they won't. And for those who didn't buy <em>Whatever You Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</em> on the first day of release during lunch hour at the Oxford HMV, here are Guillemots, who are to the Arctic Libershambles what the Beta Band were to Oasis in 1998, or what Badly Drawn Boy was to Travis in 2000-- a detour away from everyday pub-rock pabulum toward something more tasteful, more adventurous.</p><p>
    Guillemots' collective CVs-- singer/chief songwriter Fyfe Dangerfield (no, it's not real) and bassist Aristazabal Hawkes have formal classical training; guitarist MC Lord Magrao is a Brazillian with noise/metal pedigree-- make the London band sound like a bigger mess than they actually are. Together, they make adult-contemporary/contemptuous pop music. But where the Betas and Badly Drawn Boy strove to be both eccentric and accessible at the same time, the Guillemots are more pragmatic: they release improv studio jams through website downloads, while saving the proper tunes for their major-label debut, <em>From the Cliffs</em>.</p><p>
    The approach pays immediate dividends: <em>From the Cliffs</em> practically tumbles down the stairs with ""Trains to Brazil"", a triumphant clarion call that's worth a main-stage slot at Glastonbury alone. Like Doves' stellar 2005 single, ""Black and White Town"", it's the sound of dreary, grey skies starting to bleed light, its Motown momentum undercut by a sobering bridge-- ""Be thankful you're here/ Because it could be you tomorrow or next year""-- before blindsiding you with a brass-blasted chorus that'll make you see stars. But in the tradition of latter-day Talk Talk or post-<em>Kid A</em> Radiohead, Guillemots aren't so concerned with perfecting performances as illuminating the dimly lit space around them. Their obsession with atmosphere is felt most intensely on the slumberous nine-minute masterstroke ""Over the Stairs"", which imagines Paul McCartney sleepwalking through Mercury Rev's Catskills in the dead of night: candelabra-lit balladry haunted by spirits speaking in tongues, guided by possibly the most unsettling wind chimes ever committed to tape.
    </p><p>
     
    Too bad the Guillemots' phantasmagoric fascinations go unexplored on the <em>From the Cliffs</em>' second act. Instead, the swinging, dinner-party pop of ""Who Left the Lights Off Baby"" sounds like it should soundtrack some Hugh Grant romantic comedy (it even comes with an egregious sax solo for the credits roll), while would-be climax ""Go Away"" is a cod-reggae exercise burdened with a whiny, wordless chorus and an unconvincingly tough vocal from Dangerfield. But even in their most pedestrian turns, Guillemots songs abound with all manner of sublimated sonic chicanery-- kettle whistles, alarm clocks, schoolyard giggles, squeaky bird noises-- suggesting that something far more beguiling is lurking beneath the surface.

So the odds Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel, the organ-and-drums duo that goes by Mates of State, will create a mutiny with their cuddly AM pop are slim to nil. Facing improbable odds hasn't dampened the plucky twosome's spirit, but it has wizened them up. On <i>Bring It Back</i>, their fourth album, they gingerly lift the moratorium on six-strings-- a few lurk in the background throughout the record-- and explore a more varied sonic palette. The fattened sound, however, doesn't mean an altered band, just a better one.</p>
<p>Mates of State have always been fascinated by the dark, haunted corners of glistening pop melodies, and <i>Bring It Back</i> finds their fixation vibrant as ever. Gardner plays a Yamaha Electone organ from circa 1970, which produces wet, hollow sounds rich in spooky overtones. On previous efforts, the slinky loop that opens ""Think Long"" would've constituted the track's sole melody. Simple lines, left alone, echoing large-- they were Broadcast before Broadcast were Broadcast. But <i>Bring It Back features</i> Mates of State's fullest songs, and many of their longest. The added length lets them be characteristically piecemeal-- ""We attach parts together until they make a whole song,"" they claim on their website-- while deeper orchestration provides the adhesive previous efforts lacked.</p>
<p>If ""Proofs"", from 2000's <i>My Solo Project</i>, represents one possible (and thrilling) result of the couple's chemistry, <i>Bring It Back</i> suggests another. When the latter paired a spare, roomy drumbeat with a loping, calliope-style organ line and impassioned vocal teamwork, two was the magic number. New album opener ""Think Long"", meanwhile, takes along third and fourth wheels with overdubbed keyboard harmonies, accessory percussion, and multi-tracked vocals. By the group's previous standard, ""For the Actor"", which makes a joyous racket of music box twinkles and gilt trumpet, would be considered perfidious. Atop a surfeit of accoutrements, it offers the album's most guitar-like sound: the same distorted Rhodes piano feint Sufjan Stevens used to scuzz up his Trans-Siberian orchestral ""Detroit"".</p>
<p>Gardner has a flair for linear, almost arpeggiated combinations of notes, and her keyboard parts give Mates of States' songs a light, sweeping quality. But on ""Nature and the Wreck"", a delicate piano line gusts so heavily it almost blows away. Luckily, they keep it brief, allowing the track to work as a placeholder. Gardner incorporates a husky Steinway more tastefully on ""Like U Crazy"", the lungs to ""Nature and the Wreck""'s heart. Offsetting the track's vapory piano descend, Gardner's little-voice-that-could coos atop a rickety, rim-clicking beat. ""I-I-I-I like u crazy,"" she hooks, but her breathy falsetto vowels are all that matter. Weakened knees collapse entirely when Hammel starts in with the blue-eyed wop-wop-oooos, turning the track into an unlikely Righteous Brothers homage, which is good news for everyone. Meanwhile, check how the bass propels the vocal hook on ""Beautiful Dreamer"" and you'll be seeing Stars (not the thing, the Canadian pop juggernaut), who also specialize in galloping, lovesick refrains. ""For the Actor"" not only imitates that band's joyous gait but their penchant for sudden, shattered breakdowns, too.</p>
<p>Atop whimsical keys instead of chugging axes, Gardner's heart-in-hands vociferations listen less like blustery emo and more like...heart-in-hands vociferations. Which answers the question, What are sickeningly cute young couples good for if not making pop records? Producing them, of course. Seriously, if Gardner and Hammel could use a little monetary padding, they ought to consider pitching Kelly Clarkson a melody. They're one of the few pop bands who can pull off love ballad earnestness without being unintentionally funny. ""Beautiful Dreamer"" features a bridge of the kind that made ""Since U Been Gone"" a winner-- catchy, uninhibited, and awash in open hi-hat. There's only one difference: guitar is nowhere to be found.</p></div>"|5148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5148-bring-it-back/|7.8|Sam Ubl

They're getting so...old. Finding a job and having a mewling child or two used to
    mean saying goodbye to the days of obsessive-compulsive music
    snobbery. Now the internet cuts out the conventional
    legwork and here's a clever compilation of kiddie pop for
    aging indie-yuppies, with more reportedly on the way.</p><p>
    
    Yes, folks, <em>See You on the Moon!: Song for Kids of All Ages</em>
    leaves Raffi in the deep blue sea and lets Kidz Bop float on, all
    right, already. It's definitely better than the old <em>For Our
    Children</em> disc-- featuring Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, and Debbie Gibson-- I remember hearing once or twice in the parental
    Toyota Previa. But as
    that effort showed, merely hiring A-list talent (and Debbie Gibson) doesn't guarantee
    success when trying to rock the cradle. Paper Bag's compilation enlists some Pitchfork darlings-- most notably Broken Social Scene and Sufjan Stevens-- and a few lesser-knowns for a
    brilliant marketing gambit that actually turns out not to suck.</p><p>
    
    The best entries on <em>See You on the Moon!</em> are steeped with a sense of practical-minded
    wonderment. Great Lake Swimmers' ""See You on the Moon"" runs eagerly
    through a list of possible careers, indulging a child's attention to
    detail (""I'll drive my tractor in the sun/ While the chickens go bawk,
    bawk, bawk/ and the cows go moo, moo, moo""), while catchy acoustic
    guitars ring, ring, ring. ""Be Nice to
    People With Lice"", Low's Alan Sparhawk's solo acoustic opener,
    similarly features an easy sing-along melody and adult-friendly
    one-liners (cf. the title), but it's marred by the sounds of grown-up
    laughter and ""best-song-ever"" half-sarcasm. Lice are deadly serious,
    dudes. Parents just don't understand.</p><p>
    
    Broken Social Scene's spacey, subtly psychedelic ""Puff the Magic
    Dragon"" cover is a cause for Honah-Lee frolicking. Meanwhile, Sufjan
    Stevens does his usual Jesus thing (but seriously, stop asking him
    about it, you vultures), turning in a toy-orchestra take on French
    carol ""The Friendly Beasts""-- also featured on his Christmas album
    triad. Mark Kozelek's ""Leo and Luna"" is a slow, Red House
    Painters-like lullaby that also makes for a nice two-minute subway
    oasis, but Hot Chip's uncharacteristically boring ""I Can't Wake Up""
    forgets that kids have awesome bullshit detectors. And heck, FemBots'
    growly Waits/Beefheart polka on ""Under the Bed"" gives <em>me</em>
    nightmares.</p><p>
    
    As with any children's compilation, <em>See You on the Moon!</em> has a
    few tracks parents will want to skip. The kids' shouty chanting on
    space-age double-dutch ""24 Robbers"", by BSS member Apostle of Hustle, is cute but gets old even faster than children
    do-- try the Go! Team instead. Kid Koala's ""Fruit Bat"", featuring
    Lederhosen Lucil, gets nicely cartoon-like, but be warned I'll step on
    any toddler I hear repeating its chorus of ""I 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
    <em>ate</em> you"".</p><p>
    
    Montag's three brief instrumentals, though, are soothing, culminating in the glistening ""Bonne Nuit Etienne"".
    Rosie Thomas' lovely, dream-like ""Faith's Silver Elephant"" is a
    <em>real</em> children's song, tucking an achingly sung story of a girl
    and her magical mammal pals into a bed of softest down. It also evokes
    the weird, unspoken fantasy behind buying an indie kid's-music comp in
    this age of ubiquitous over-parenting: ""Wait and see/ I'll be the
    coolest kid around.""</p></div>"|2118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2118-see-you-on-the-moon-songs-for-kids-of-all-ages/|6.6|Marc Hogan

Flynt's own self-appraisal was no less grandiose, once claiming that he ""did for hillbilly music what Ornette Coleman did for jazz."" These were grand conceits for a man who ceased making music more than 20 years ago, and whose total recorded output had been until recently consigned to oblivion.</p><p>
    But time has a way of transmuting self-mythology into canon, and recent years have seen Flynt's reputation loom ever larger. The last five years have witnessed the unearthing of a substantial and often stunning catalog of Flynt recordings by labels like Locust and Recorded. These works document the road not taken by the majority of Flynt's early minimalism cohort, many of whom abandoned Western music for the sacred east under the authoritarian tutelage of Pandit Pran Nath. Flynt on the other hand played the prodigal son, returning to the native musical soil of his Carolina boyhood. In doing so, Flynt prospected the vast rocky territory of a new American primitivism, mining veins in which the antiquarian and the avant-garde were reconciled.</p><p>
    Flynt's vision of a ""new American ethnic music"" has surely found its avatar in the great awakening of American free music currently underway. Ensembles like Pelt and Jackie-O Motherfucker have offered up grave séances of the American musical past, in which old voices have been conjured to speak new words. Meanwhile the late John Fahey's monumental Revenant label continues to diagnose a common American savagery in artists as diverse as Charlie Feathers and Albert Ayler. We should not be surprised at this minor renaissance afoot. Americans are always after their own wilderness.</p><p>
    More surprising is the participation of Europe. One would be hard pressed to think of a time when the old world and that American frontier seemed more impossibly distant. Yet the Belgian Bram Devens has traversed time, ocean and the war to speak the language of that great wilderness. Devens borrowed his moniker from a fitting piece of Americana, the malevolent brick-hurling mouse Ignatz of George Hermann's celebrated pre-war cartoon strip, <em>Krazy Kat</em>. On his eponymous debut, Ignatz casts his bricks in brutally slow motion and lets them careen into vast darkness.</p><p>
<i>Ignatz is oddly glorious. Not unlike Robert Lowe's fine Lichens project, Devens conjures sparsely with guitar, pedals, and sampler. Slow, twanging guitar chords open the album on ""Rebound from the Cliff"". Devens barks out barely comprehensible lyrics in a thick reverberating drawl, like some cybernetic Dock Boggs. The song is soon subsumed into a flurry of melodious finger-picking treated to sound like an amped-up player piano, looping into ruin. The somber ""Echo All Acoustically Correct"" follows, no more than spectral folk punctuated by spurts of tar black noise. </i></p><p>
    On the grand and ethereal acoustic number ""I Look at Her with the Euh"", Devens wails like Roscoe Holcomb on nitrous oxide, his cartoonishly high-pitched vocals ever shading into inhuman distortion. Again, Devens croons deliriously over zombie blues and bells on ""The Radiant Sheen"", a track that would sit comfortably on either volume of Flynt's own <em>Backporch Hillbilly Blues</em>, or just about any entry in the Sun City Girls' <em>Carnival Folklore Resurrection</em> series, rising from gas-addled jaunt to a cracked no wave crescendo of busted guitar carnage. </p><p>
    ""All My Hopes Have Collapsed"" is corroded bluegrass, as if reconstructed by Matthew Bower under his Sunroof! moniker-- all static and scree. The mandolin-like runs sound jury-rigged from alien sources, the hollow foot stomp slowed to a dead knock. The album resolves in the eight-minute epic ""The Sinister Snow Squaws"". A simple, mournful melody is reiterated against an insistently ringing throb, like the wind through steel wires. Crippled guitars duel as the wind evolves into thick miasma, descending like a pall over everything and yielding finally to silence.</p><p>
    Listen carefully and you will catch the real American folk revival unfolding, not the bearded acoustics of handsome hippies and earnest neo-troubadours. It lies behind them and beneath them, and yes, even in Brussels. The music is noisy and untrammeled. It does not speak of clouds and it does not speak of justice. But it will occasionally undertake the hard work of all true folk music, which is reckoning with the gravity of the past. And at its best, it will find the New World old again, ineluctably old.</p></div>"|4168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4168-ignatz/|8.0|Brent S. Sirota

The title of Astor Piazzolla's classic piece of nouveau 
    tango fits nicely as a descriptor of the Tango Saloon's music-- they even cover 
    the song on this, their debut album. Tango Saloon mastermind Julian Curwin 
    has clearly spent time soaking in Piazzolla's intoxicating 
    creations, and he uses them as his starting point, drawing in electronic 
    elements as well as snatches of free and cool jazz and soundtracks. His 
    press claims that the ""Saloon"" portion of the name comes from the music's 
    affinity for Ennio Morricone, but I hear just as much Lalo Schifrin and 
    Jerry Goldsmith in there, and the Western aspect of the music is frankly 
    pretty played down.</p><p>
    Curwin plays guitar among other things, and he's ably backed by a cast of 
    musicians who seem to understand the tango foundation of the music, but 
    aren't so tied to a sense of tradition that they're afraid to take it in new 
    directions. Violinist Shenton Gregory and double bassist Kory Horwood both 
    play a big role in shaping the album's sound and Gregory especially gives it 
    a shot of romanticism, but it's accordionist Svetlana Bunic who does the 
    most outside of Curwin to give the album its shape. She even wrote ""Upon a 
    Time"", one of the record's best compositions, a dramatic, high-speed tango 
    that alternates between prickly oompah passages Danny Elfman would kill for 
    and more contemplative front parlor passages filled with soaring violin and 
    musette accordion.</p><p>
    Curwin's own ""March of the Big Shoe"" injects some Pink Panther sax to the 
    mix, ripping along over a chugging lower-register piano rhythm, while Sam 
    Golding plays trumpet, flugelhorn, and tuba on the gibbering, surreal horn 
    arrangement that tops ""The Little Plane That Could"". His horns are cast 
    adrift in a fog of vibes, setting a fever drift carnival atmosphere. By far 
    the most outré and challenging piece of music on the album, though, is ""Man 
    with the Bongos"", eight minutes of bongo fury underscored by a squelching 
    bass synth that sound like amplified stomach grumblings. The horns, 
    initially so together, wind up soloing all over the place, squabbling with 
    the accordion and violin in a free jazz-inspired melee, and the piece 
    detours into a mariachi surf thing before heading off into abstract funk.</p><p>
    In crafting a tribute to Piazzolla, Curwin nicely captures the searching, 
    fearless spirit of his hero and comes up with a lot of cool, unique music in 
    the process. It's not going to replace <em>Tango: Zero Hour</em> on my stereo, but 
    it'll serve as a nice companion anyway. The album's chief failings are 
    small, usually amounting to a poorly chosen organ sound (as on ""Formaggio"") 
    or owing to a sense of structure that can get overly lackadaisical. Overall, 
    though, it's satisfyingly weird, and you're not likely to hear anything else 
    like it any time soon.</p></div>"|8315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8315-the-tango-saloon/|7.4|Joe Tangari

The former channels its energy through concrete structural cells to produce a sort of lucid pleasure; the latter-- although now ossified enough for its maneuvers to be as familiar as pop-- deranges this linear passage with a variety of skew-angled, semi-permeable membranes to produce cognitive dissonance. Pop songwriting often emphasizes singing as an aesthetic center; post-rock is often instrumental, or burdened with vocals so monochromatic and faceless as to be inconsequential. Pop is warm, utopian, and emotional; post-rock is cold, dystopian, and cerebral.</p><p> 
    
    Despite these tensions, Patrick Phelan's third LP manages to believably reconcile the two genres. With its dirge-heavy and lugubrious shimmer, <em>Cost</em>'s slinky post-rock is, in part, completely textbook. The album opens with the instrumental ""In Words"", where great slabs of bass plot vertices on an expansive graph of quivering ambiance; its sloughs and peaks are pretty but don't distinguish Phelan from the post-rock pack. The same holds true for all of the instrumentals, which are usually fairly brief interludes: ""In View"" lets its delicate scraps of acoustic guitar drift through a gusty tunnel, and ""We Forgive Our Own"" barely hints at structure with a smattering of percussive plinks.</p><p> 
    
    But ""Favor"", one of the non-instrumental songs that comprise the bulk of the album, does distinguish Phelan from other rock bands who've added laptops to their live arsenal: Its fleet bassline, insistent percussion, and crystalline guitar unfurl in orderly rank and file, intermittently gussied up with a rock crunch that amplifies the song's forward momentum. Phelan gives no quarter to superfluous vocals or disorganized arrangements. He lays out his quietly dissonant melodies in transparent, sequential lines, and his vocals-- stoically emotive and unapologetically human-- become the centerpiece of any song they inhabit. Phelan's voice scuds across the slate-grey sky of ""Ruin"" like a thundercloud, overshadowing the spare track instead of blurring into it. As ""Settlements"" see-saws between electro-acoustic atmosphere and pyrotechnic sparks, it evokes a Brit-pop Mogwai; the sinuous and chiming torch song ""Sails Descending"" sounds like Elliot Smith singing for Bark Psychosis. Elegant and understated but not obtusely obscure, <em>Cost</em> locates the humanity in a genre that tacitly seems more interested in apocalyptic wastelands and extreme post-human futures. </p></div>"|6262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6262-cost/|7.1|Brian Howe

From now on, whether it is true or not, I will weave into my moral fiber the belief that he is a shepherd of the club nouveau of punk ethos hip-hop-- fueled more by intention than skill. He produced every track on Murs' last album, <em>Murs 3:16</em>, which I liked, and every track on the follow-up <em>Murray's Revenge</em>, which I like nearly as much.</p><p>
    After a year in which the trap-hop/coke-rap contingent ground the internets to dust, I can appreciate a record that does not contain one nigga, bitch, faggot, brick, time served, or clip emptied, and still is not a steaming mess of defanged braggadocio about commitment to the four elements. There is a limit on both sides, and Murs seems to have found the median where he can talk about himself without sounding self-absorbed. He speaks on topics as varied as racial identity (""Dark-Skinned White Girls""), a nice fade (""Barbership""), and fidelity (""Love &amp; Affection"") with a charming aplomb weaned equally on (old) Death Row and the Good Life Café, both of which were not far removed from his home section in the Mid-City area. Similar to the Kanye-hyped Lupe Fiasco, Murs is an artist whose appeal is grounded in his honesty about <i>not being a gangster even though he grew up around some. He calls out fake thugs not with accusations of hip-hop treason or murderous threats but a challenge to a gentlemanly fistfight, describes South Central as not all that bad, doesn't have a chain because his mom would have killed him, and boasts about his prowess like a modern-day Positive K. He's even tempered some of the misogyny that made bits of <em>3:16</em> non-Mom-friendly, though he is not yet to Common levels of Millennial Man gender equity. </i></p><p>
    Murs may not inspire myspace shrines like Slug or blog jack-offs like Ghostface, but he's once again made a record that should not alienate fans of either. Maybe that makes him the Broken Social Scene of hip-hop, I don't know, but with the kind of production from 9th Wonder that seems to improve when removed from the comforts of Little Brother, <i>Murray's Revenge is one of the better gang-unrelated and Dre-unaffiliated records to come from the West Coast since Murs' last one. </i></p></div>"|5515.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5515-murrays-revenge/|7.0|Peter Macia

    sure ever existed. His Charlemagne project, now two albums old, cooks up 
    music for a breezy summer drive, stuffed with wispy male/female harmonies, 
    strummed guitars, and airily recorded drums. It evokes the indie rock of the 
    mid-90s in hi-er fi, and the power pop of the post-punk era with modern 
    amenities like more deeply nuanced synthesizer tones and high-quality 
    production on a low budget.</p><p>
<em>Detour Allure</em> rings with an abundance of sharp melodies and quick tempos, 
    arranged with a minimum of fuss. Spare flourishes of synth and special 
    effects guitar spice up the proceedings, offering shiny accents to sometimes workmanlike 
    compositions. ""Your Scars"" trips along on a nice two-step country beat and 
    features some unexpected chord changes for its wordless middle eight. It's 
    followed by the album's finest track, ""In the Fuselage"", a weirdly catchy 
    song that earns its place in your memory with an inventive melody delivered 
    via mellow, introverted harmonies. ""Fave Unknown"" takes a crunchier route, 
    riding fuzzy bass and buzzing keyboard hooks.</p><p>
    
    Though consistency of craft is one of Charlemagne's strengths, there are a 
    few bits that don't work, like the unfortunate rhyming of ""cherries,"" 
    ""very,"" ""scary,"" and ""berries"" in the otherwise catchy ""Pink &amp; Silver"" and 
    the overly ponderous closer ""Hello September"", which ends the album with too 
    much whimper and not enough bang. By and large, though, Charlemagne's 
    sophomore effort is an enjoyable, if not exactly innovative, album, best 
    served warm with a light breeze.</p></div>"|1762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1762-detour-allure/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    to nowhere fast, the album's tangential importance is undeniable. Recorded in
    summer 2000, it documents the early of stages of the Jeff Tweedy/Jim O'Rourke
    mind-meld as well as drummer Glenn Kotche's
    introduction to Wilcoworld. If he never made strange squawks with
    Loose Fur, Tweedy may not have amassed the courage to make <em>Yankee
    Hotel Foxtrot</em> or shove Jay Bennett and his tangled
    old-white-guy dreads toward indie oblivion; without Loose Fur, the
    remarkable solo on ""At Least That's What You Said"" may still be a mere
    guitar-god figment and ""pretentious Wilco"" would probably still sound
    something like ""Via Chicago"".</p><p>
    
    Considering how this informal trio apparently played such a large role in uncovering the more experimental cells underneath
    Tweedy's skull, it's ironic that the relatively
    straightforward <em>Born Again in the USA</em> is more
    musically traditional than some of Wilco's recent output. With tapes
    and tapes of formal collaborations now behind them, the boys are past
    the ""feeling out"" stage and onto making proper songs. Just check the
    track lengths: Whereas only one <em>Loose Fur</em> track clocked in at
    under five minutes, <em>Born Again</em> only has one that goes over that
    mark. Basking in the sun-dried guitar echoes of the Eagles,
    the Byrds, and the Grateful Dead, <em>Born Again</em> is sturdy classic
    rock revivalism sans stupefied jamming. Adding even more structure and continuity is a satirical godlessness that binds several songs together.</p><p>
    
    As the punny title suggests, much of the LP confronts religion with a sly, blue state smirk. ""The Ruling Class"" tells a dubious account of a crack 'n' smack messiah who's ""drinkin' beer, just trying to get down."" Sung by Tweedy, the aim is secular comedy motivated by biting social
    critique, but the sarcasm sounds smug-- even when deflated by an
    easygoing smiling-whistle refrain. The same complaint can be lobbed at
    ""Thou Shall Wilt"", which finds O'Rourke offering running commentary
    for the Ten Commandments (to No. 4, ""Remember the Sabbath day and keep
    it holy,"" the singer responds, ""[It's] such a pain, this Sabbath thing
    is so arcane/ I don't want to desecrate, my only day to sleep in
    late""). Such Bible-baiting is mildly amusing at first but quickly
    succumbs to novelty-- especially for an emotional martyr like
    Tweedy, who tackled similar territory with peaceful poise on <em>A Ghost Is Born</em>'s ""Theologians"".</p><p>
    
    Luckily, <em>Born Again</em> regularly sidesteps its clunky central
    theme for Tweedy and O'Rourke's songwriting specialty: pained
    reflections on relationship dysfunction. With its circular acoustic
    guitar pattern and hushed sense of folky foreboding, O'Rourke's
    ""Answers to Your Questions"" could have found a home on one of his poppier solo records. Predictably, the titular responses
    are devastating: ""You always write to ask how come I don't write back/
    Well, I could tell you/ But then I'd have to write a letter that would
    start/ 'I finally found it in my heart not to forgive you'""). His
    soothing delivery quivering alongside a slight crescendo of xylophone
    and precise picking, O'Rourke shades his detachment from a dumped ex
    with palpable ache.</p><p>
    
    The same goes for <em>Born Again</em>'s finale,
    ""Wanted"", the most Wilco-ish track in the Loose Fur canon thus far.
    Boppy piano accompanies a classic Tweedy opening salvo: ""When I say
    that she's a rapist/ That really isn't what I mean."" The song's
    approach to sexual awakening includes religious overtones and
    questions of lust vs. saintliness but stays devoid of any holier-than-thou posturing. Wounded and feeling ambiguously abused, Tweedy's
    narrator defends his indiscretions, ""She's not so well rounded, she
    has points you don't see/ She does whatever she wants, and I swear she
    wanted me."" Topped with an air-guitar-worthy dollop of harmonized
    six-strings, the song wraps up in just three minutes but its confused longing
    lingers.</p><p>
    
    There's no doubt <em>Born Again</em> is superior to its predecessor in
    nearly every respect. Even the eight-plus minutes of ""Wreckroom""--
    complete with Tweedy surrealities, wafting solos, and ambient denoument-- are
    more purposeful than anything on <em>Loose Fur</em>. But, since the
    album's sharpest moments largely serve to underline the individual strengths of
    its more well known songwriters rather than the group as a unit, it acts as a
    teasing appetizer for new O'Rourke and Wilco full-lengths more than it
    satisfies in its own right.</p></div>"|4854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4854-born-again-in-the-usa/|7.3|Ryan Dombal

    with Red Sparrowes was released and quickly sold out, but the band is just finally issuing its phenomenal debut, which features a mix of  
    hushed beauty, dark, dense melodies, and soft, co-ed vocals.</p><p>
    
    The band's sound features many of  
    the stronger characteristics of vocal post-rock: The songs generally wrap up around the seven-minute mark, and feature quiet atmospherics between loud outbursts of guitar and drums. Melodies  
    build over the course of a track, rarely shifting gears quickly but leaving plenty of room for the instruments to interplay, creating a fabric of sound in which layers are  
    packed densely and no single musician overtakes the others.</p><p>
    
    Co-vocalists Nikki King and Champ Bennett play off of one another but rarely overlap. Bennett's vocals are so low that at times they're almost a  
    mumble, while King's angelic voice floats dream-like over the music beneath it. On the album opener, ""Makeshift Shelters"", their  
    voices harmonize over warped piano and manipulated tape droning; it isn't until a few minutes into ""Even Numbers"" that the band  
    erupts, dispelling any concern about this being a strictly ambient  
    affair.</p><p>
    
    The players excel at building tension through a use of negative space. On ""Loud and  
    Clear"", the instruments drop off, leaving a lonely guitar to  
    calmly pick away. After a minute or so, King's soft voice can be  
    heard in the background, providing delicate vocals.  
    ""We'll Lean That Way Forever"" is another experiment in ambiance and  
    effects. Here, quiet guitar feedback is augmented by vocals from King  
    that were put to tape six months prior to the rest of the album. Her voice has been twisted and warped, adding  
    a haunting sense of otherworldliness to the track. But the strongest  
    moments sprinkled throughout <em>55:12</em> are those when softer,  
    more peaceful sounds are contrasted with bursts of driving up-tempo  
    melody. It may not be a new formula, but Gregor Samsa manage  
    to breathe some life into it.</p></div>"|3691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3691-5512/|7.8|Cory D. Byrom

She enthused about the importance of letting go and stretching beyond self-imposed boundaries in order to capture the intensity and unpredictability of the sessions.  The result was arguably the band's best album to date. It's unsurprising then that Weiss chose to experiment in a similar field with Quasi's seventh release, <em>When the Going Gets Dark</em>,
    returning to Fridmann to polish off the recordings.</p><p>
    
    ""There's a lot of distortion on everything, and I think the distortion eventually becomes the entity,"" said Weiss of Sleater-Kinney's playing on <em>The Woods</em>. ""It becomes the guts of the music."" That embrace of fuzzed-out lows and grimy distortion-- as well as extended improvisations and looser song structures-- fizzles through the backbone of <em>When the Going Gets Dark</em>. Her singer/songwriter ex-husband Sam Coomes, who makes up the other half of the Portland, Ore.-based duo, ditches Quasi's signature keyboard sound in favor of emphatically tumbling piano, which is added to feedback and raucous, challenging, defiant vocal melodies. Coomes intermittently howls and screams between the Jerry Lee Lewis-style staccato riff chaos of ""The Rhino"", and the soprano whoops on the title track sound like a sharp blade running over the deep spread of bass and Weiss' clattering drums.  The only real rub lies in the lyrics, which-- unusually for the sharp-minded Coomes-- veer between cringing and faintly ridiculous, such as, ""I'm stuck in a tree, doing my thing with the chimpanzees.""</p><p>
    
    
    It's not only the evident friction born from an extended working and personal relationship that catalyses their sound.  Weiss is a remarkable, unpredictable drummer, and the pair play perfectly together, having reached the point at which improvisation becomes the result of an intuitive locking of creative minds.  Standout tracks such as the mainly instrumental, knotty jazz of ""Death Culture Blues"" and ""Presto Change-O"" show how much more vitality and room to breathe the pair have when not focused on studio trickery or elaborate overdubbing.  And although the song eventually collapses into a darkly syrupy shamble of good tidings, the opening bars of ""Merry X-Mas""-- which feature an outbreak of edgy-yet-glitzy piano notes evaporating into a captivating solo and the pounding rhythms of Weiss's kit-- reveal that Quasi have cast their net wider and tighter with the impulse of their revived energy.</p></div>"|6620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6620-when-the-going-gets-dark/|7.0|Mia Lily Clarke

    coherent compilation of contemporary heavy rock, the sound
    of the lid coming off the coffin, or the rap of it being nailed down? 
    The canon wields a heavy hammer-- strike <i>Invaders</i> with it, and
    you can cross metal shows off your list of things to do this summer-- and then again, so do 18 guitar-dragging loud rock bands. Bonus question: Would you rather be <i>Flex Your Head</i>, or <i>20
    Years of Dischord</i>? Most days, I figure <i>Invaders</i> for the
    former.</p><p>
    This peak comes after a long climb of metalists, well, playing metal:
    The Fucking Champs slogging since 1994, Torche dudes pounding in their
    last band Floor since 1993, Big Business predecessors Karp around
    since 1995, High on Fire's Matt Pike and his former band Sleep since
    1991, Witch drummer J Mascis all the way back to Deep Wound, formed
    in 1982.</p><p>
    Best, perhaps, is the good this transformation's done for those who wanted to be
    about to rock but were having trouble figuring out how. Try Saviours,
    who with ""Circle of Servants Bodies"", finally lay down the
    emotional-hardcore sing-songy plowshears of their former band Yaphet
    Kotto for the earthier salt of tom fills and big sustain, topped off
    with amalgamated Dio and Maiden solo-run riffs. From the sound of it,
    these dudes were just happy to find out that metal existed; now they
    swing with all the West Coast energy Yaphet Kotto had promised and
    then eventually bled out. Big Business, for their part, go from a
    murderously tight Karp to an even tighter clenched two-piece bass and
    drums rolling grenade: They're as locked up as all the years they
    played together would dictate, yet still manage to swim in the wake of
    their own songs. ""As the Day Was Dawning"" moves so deliberately it
    seems to have only half-dead listeners in mind, which, when
    corpse-paint catches on again, will no doubt be appropriate.</p><p>
    Pelican, High on Fire, and Dungen all do credible versions of Pelican,
    High on Fire, and Dungen, but let's talk the high skinny cut-off
    jean-jacket nerd quotient: Black Mountain's Doors organs and <i>Wanna
    Buy a Bridge</i> sax jamming, Danava's proggy/techy almost no-wave
    take on metal, constantly twitching and sniffing and scratching over
    shifty bass and ""Osbournes"" Ozzy vocals, and Witch, who sound
    simultaneously gigantic and like their lead singer has a high-school
    beatings derived speech impediment.</p><p>
    Kemado's war-elephant in the room, mining such an already-alive genre
    (Black Sabbath, Motörhead, Celtic Frost, etc., all still
    around, at least sort of), is the ironic carpetbagger factor: Are
    these bands griming up metal's happy rainbow like so much Bushwick
    real-estate? Here, <i>Invaders</i> is saved by its own
    hyper-loserdom: even the next-big-things on here, such as The Sword,
    never break the frame-- it's all D&amp;D;, all the time-- and others, such
    as The Champs and their ilk, essentially share a niche with Steve Vai
    or Yngwie Malmsteen.</p><p>
    Just don't listen when they foist this stuff on ya: ""The unenlightened
    epoch of hairlessness became a fleeting memory as their second-hand
    sweaters grew holes, unraveled, and were fashioned into gnarled
    headbands."" If you're not now, you never were.</p></div>"|2117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2117-invaders/|7.9|Zach Baron

    Wax released a single called ""Dextrous"" on a nothing record label Outta the 
    north of England called Warp. The record's drums were crude like a 
    fingerpainting and its amelodic vreeps and klungs were what guys who spent 
    too much time in dark warehouses called hooks. But its bass sound-- queerly 
    metallic and low as it could go-- could clear up that sinus problem you've 
    been having. In the fall of 1990, NoW released ""Aftermath"", similarly queasy 
    to ""Dextrous"", with the junkie's paranoia bonus of a shrill loop of female 
    vocals that spiraled like an Outta control body on the dancefloor.</p><p>
    These early singles were part of the ""bleep"" sub-sub-genre of Northern 
    English rave that established Warp as the label we know today, bringing us 
    almost two decades worth of forward thinking electronic music by acts like 
    Gravenhurst and Maxïmo Park. By 1991, when NoW released its debut album, 
    <i>A Word of Science, it had abandoned the anonymity of white label 
    singles for a rainbow-hued cartoon cover with the names George Evelyn and 
    Kevin Harper attached to it. The album included the earlier bleep singles, 
    but the meat were the mid-tempo hip-hop tracks full of whimsical steel drums 
    and Steve Miller Band samples.</i></p><p>
    The next album didn't appear until 1995; by then Harper had gone and 
    possibly taken the wit (and definitely the bass) with him. 1999's <i>Carboot 
    Soul improbably found Evelyn signed to Pavement's label in that strange 
    late-'90s moment when Matador went about becoming an electronic label by 
    signing/licensing all sorts of wack shit. (Burger/Ink excepted.) By then 
    Evelyn had settled on the golden mean of downtempo: slow hip-hop breaks and 
    wobbly-boom basslines, plus some instrumental textures in place of 
    so-20th-century musical concerns like harmony or melodic development, and 
    voices there to punctuate drum loops rather than express feelings, tell 
    stories, or give you something to hum in line at the DMV.</i></p><p>
    This is why the average person does not need more than one or two downtempo 
    albums. Banana Republic/cocktail lounge jokes may seem like cheap grousing 
    in 2006, but the records keep coming. Like every downtempo producer, Evelyn 
    has his moments, and mostly they're felicitous combinations of texture that 
    are just a little prettier or hypnotic than the competition. But he's rarely 
    surprising, 'cause that would be gauche. <i>In a Space Outta Sound opens 
    with ""Passion"", almost seven minutes of beats-and-strings with firefly 
    flickers of organ that could be the downtempo platonic ideal if that didn't 
    make it sound better that it actually is.</i></p><p>
    The sepia-tinted (of course) cover photo features a bank of loosely lashed 
    together mobile soundsystem speakers, and Evelyn draws much from reggae, 
    especially its trilling guitars and low-end theories. (Not particularly 
    surprising considering downtempo sits almost exactly between reggae's lope 
    and hip-hop's boom-bap.) Sadly the two best (read: different) tracks come at 
    the end, a shame because you'll have probably put on something closer to 
    actual music by then. ""Soul Purpose"" is trip-hop if it had been born in 
    sun-soaked Miami rather than drizzly Bristol; an 808 booms and pings in the 
    bottom and some strings drift off the top, like a screwed version of the 
    girly, wistful booty bass of Ghost Town DJ's ""My Boo"". ""African Pirates"" 
    juggles a few bongo patterns for the only track with an interesting rhythm, 
    but, in keeping with downtempo's beanbag/crash pad aesthetic, the interest 
    is cerebral-- it sounds good to your ears but won't do much for the stuff 
    below the neck.</p><p>
    But, and it's a big but: lots of electronic music that the casual consumer 
    couldn't differentiate from downtempo gets dap from e-heads who profess to 
    hate downtempo. Listening to Theo Parrish's <i>First Floor directly 
    following </i><i>In a Sound, you realize there's often not much melodic 
    development or rhythmic variation in Parrish's highly touted music either. 
    But the difference, at least as far as I can figure, is something Parrish 
    articulates in titles like ""Dusty Cabinets"" and ""Ugly Edits"". His music is 
    fuzzier, funkier, crunkier, it retains the grit of the music that inspired 
    it that, grit that downtempo traded for ""perfect"" engineering when it became 
    a genre that got its own section in the store. Evelyn could do with letting 
    his machinery grow out and stay unwashed, cuz </i><i>In a Sound just reminds 
    you of the best shampooing you ever got.</i></p></div>"|5795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5795-in-a-space-outta-sound/|6.8|Jess Harvell

No wonder they keep their hair at face-shielding length. When casting out into the improvisatory dark, eye contact is off limits. You're in a private headspace, where doing your thing <em>right</em> means doing it to the exclusion of external phenomena. The more withdrawn each individual member, the more cohesive the group dynamic: Is this meditation class? No, it's the paradox by which <em>Dins</em> lives and dies.</p><p>
    
    Suffice it to call the Ills a jam band: <em>Dins</em> eschews conventional structure and blurs the line between song and improvisation-- there are eight tracks here but fewer tunes. The album's opening sweep tucks its only riff three minutes deep into ""Electriclife"", the second track, buttressing it on both sides with liquid metallic noise. Amid the seeming chaos, sudden spurts of song are actually quite effective-- they don't come across as submerged, but rather as standing sentry over the teeming formlessness.</p><p>
    
    My only wish is for a little more synthesis; <em>Dins</em> is often overly simplistic, playing the soft/loud game rather than tackling the more complicated task of consolidation. After all, noise and melody need not be mutually exclusive. But that's a choice not a maxim, so I won't say closer ""Another Day Another Night"" suddenly ""gets it,"" but rather just follows the tack of forebearers like My Bloody Valentine, Spacemen 3, and Hawkwind. Riding a galloping, less drum-circular tom rhythm, Psychic Ills heap on whooshes of vox, cavernous guitar trills, and flecks of sublime, barely audible glockenspiel. The volume holds steady, resisting the call to climax with gratuitous feedback and flailing drum fills. Instead we get a beautiful, legible guitar solo-- the line we've waited an album for. The song is breezy at eight-plus minutes where a bottom-heavy track like ""January Rain"" sorta slogs despite finishing in under six.</p><p>
    
    This well-rendered, highly enjoyable debut drags on me the same way as that Black Mountain LP did. Both albums have wonderful moments but their creators are a little too comfortable in their own sloth. Maybe it's a drugs-unlock-it thing-- a valid excuse in their book, maybe, but not mine. Or maybe Psychic Ills are feeling each other out as improvisational musicians-- a process that can take years-- while learning the contours of one of rock's most challenging idioms.</p></div>"|6596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6596-dins/|7.4|Sam Ubl

Each of his opuses forayed into some new arena, and every shift in his approach correspondingly increased the size of the venues he toured.  For more than a decade he was unstoppable, picking up the freaky funk baton from George Clinton and parlaying it into genuine superstardom.  Funny, though, how  short the trip from top of the pops to ""News of the Weird"" marginalization can be-- after changing his name to an unpronounceable ""love symbol"" in the early 1990s, he spent the  better part of a decade roaming the wilderness, kicking out poorly distributed albums that ironically might have reached a larger audience had he not split from Warner Brothers to go it alone.</p><p>
    
    From an image perspective, the New Power Generation era saw Prince transformed into a bizarre caricature of righteousness, religious and otherwise.  But just as the path from peaks to lows can be quickly traversed, artists can swing back just as quickly, and 2004's <em>Musicology</em> gathered plaudits by the bushel, partially restoring Prince's critical reputation, as well as his commercial fortunes.  In retrospect, it seems that <em>Musicology</em> was labeled a comeback in essence for not being an embarrassment.  <em>3121</em> does a bit better than that, coming up with a handful of infectious songs-- it's his best since the symbol record, although certainly there remains a massive chasm between it and his masterpieces.</p><p>
    
    Speaking in terms of his classic era, <em>3121</em> is more ""Gett Off"" than ""Nothing Compares 2 U"".  The opening title track works almost entirely on eccentricity, as a huge crowd of pitch-shifted Princes harmonize on lyrics that basically amount to directions to a party. On the other end of the record, ""Get on the Boat"" boasts a sharp horn arrangement (with solos from Maceo Parker, no less) and a funk undercarriage vintage enough to have come straight from a thrift-shop basement-- and the loose, live feel doesn't hurt either.</p><p>
    
    One thing that ""Get on the Boat"" exhibits in its piano part and timbale eruptions is a Latin influence that's more pervasive on <em>3121</em> than on any previous Prince album. ""Te Amo Corazon"" is a nicely nuanced ballad built on a slow, slightly rock-tinged mambo beat, and there are snatches of Cuban piano and Brazilian drums that crop up all over.  Crunchy electro is the dominant strain in most of the album's best tracks, though, including the killer single ""Black Sweat"", the fractured keyboard riff of ""Lolita"", and ""Love"", inhabited by squishy keyboard and a monster chorus that slashes the ascending melody with buzzing synth bass.  ""The Word"" strikes a nice electro-acoustic dichotomy, layering spacey synthesizer and a programmed beat with acoustic guitar and a strong sax hook.</p><p>
    
    If the entire album were up to these levels, we'd be onto something, but ""Fury"" tempers the impact of its stunning lead guitar part with a hopelessly dated keyboard patch and generic rock drumming. ""Incense &amp; Candles"" is predictable bedroom r&amp;b; that relies too heavily on manipulated vocals, swerving into a little rap-like passage exactly when I began to think, ""I bet there's a little rap-like passage in this song.""  He might have at least brought in a guest to deliver something more interesting.</p><p>
    
    So, two albums into a career revival, Prince is still only kinda sorta ""back.""  He's never going to be as surprising as he was in his heyday, of course, and it's probably unfair to expect anything like that from him again.  All told, <em>3121</em> is a pretty ordinary-sounding record, largely stuck in another, friendlier sonic decade-- namely the 80s.  If nothing else, Prince is slowly regaining the plot, and of course, there remain plenty of great old records in his catalog to revisit while he finds it.</p></div>"|6481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6481-3121/|6.0|Joe Tangari

The 18 songs on the group's debut <em>Orphanage</em> were initially conceived as short stories, and each appears to have been assembled directly upon that slim border that separates the impressions of actual past events from those only imagined. And though Voices and Organs' dreamy sound is predominantly centered on electronic instruments and grainy, processed tape effects, the album frequently sounds akin to the hermetic psych-folk of Finnish artists like Islaja or Lau Nau, capable of instantly transporting the listener into its insular, alien landscape.</p><p>
    As its title implies, what lyrical action there is on this album centers on the stories of a young boy and girl in a fictitious orphanage. Yet throughout the album, the joint male/female vocals, though sung in English, are typically so buried beneath wisps of gauzy sound that their storylines are rendered virtually undetectable. Since the songs had their origins in prose, none are truly equipped with what could be easily identified as choruses, or in some cases discernable vocal melodies at all. Instead the vocalists' inscrutable croons and whispers move like sleepwalkers through the dimmed halls, their paths guided along by the music's ambiguous contours.</p><p>
    Constructed almost entirely without noticeable percussion, <em>Orphanage</em> seems intended to promote a certain immersive stupor. If you are able to fend off its narcotic effects, however, the album soon reveals itself to be packed close with absorbing detail, the songs carefully edited and sequenced to appear as one seamless episode. A scrap of piano on ""Trees Are Bending"" leads almost imperceptibly into ""Staircase, Attic, Window"", its delicate melody continued with strummed guitar, melodica, and gently cascading vocals. ""Through the City"" opens with a brassy fanfare that soon moves into supple dunes of analog synth, while ""Sundays"" has a warm, needle-on-vinyl intimacy that's quickly exchanged for the wobbly guitar distortions of ""Boychild"". And Lindmark and company make their most overtly folk-related gestures on the two editions of the acoustic bedroom hymn ""Idle Words"", their narrative distilled to a series of half-awakened, wordless hums. </p><p>
    With their Scandinavian background and their graceful, elliptical flow, Voices and Organs seem to demand comparison to Sigur Rós, but <em>Orphanage</em> reveals none of that group's patient, rigorous crescendos or attention to orchestral scale. By all appearances, Voices and Organs prefer to sculpt their individual chronicles on a more microscopic level, leaving their songs with an appearance as diffuse and ephemeral as a chance burst of geyser steam. All that remains to be seen is if the group intend to further build upon the fragile, ethereal structures of <em>Orphanage</em>, or if their music is by its very nature destined to quietly dissipate into the atmosphere like vapor, leaving behind only its collection of lightly dazed witnesses. </p></div>"|8546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8546-orphanage/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

    development he was challenged by a friend to make music that couldn't
    possibly be used on a film soundtrack. Whether or not it was
    intentional, the Books have in a sense followed through on this
    request. By seeding their tracks with voices-- many actually drawn
    from obscure movies-- the Books have ensured that their music exists
    as a self-contained world of its own, one that doesn't easily lend
    itself to reinforcing an unrelated image. Their songs are their own
    little movies.</p><p>
    
    Even so, the Books continue to take on other sound-related projects in
    addition to their records. In April 2004 they recorded four short
    tracks to be used in conjunction with a work created for the French
    Ministry of Culture; the Books were charged with crafting music for
    the building's elevators. Giving in to repeated requests for this
    material, the band compiled the music on a homemade 3"" CD-R, along
    with some miscellaneous material from their extensive sound library.</p><p>
    
    Ranging from about 30 seconds to almost 90, the four elevator pieces
    are, though short, prime Books material. Though lighter and quieter,
    ""Fralite"", through it's layering of guitar and cello, captures the
    whimsy and ache of longing of ""Tokyo"". The stately ballroom piano of
    ""Egaberte"", which can be heard as the soundtrack when visiting The
    Books website, is in a sense the quintessential elevator music,
    localized by the sampled voices speaking French throughout.
    ""Liternite"" is a surprisingly complete little piece, with an intro of
    bass, wooden fish and a singing voice pulled from a folk song building
    steadily to a small crescendo that fades quickly after its peak. ""It's
    Musiiiiic!"" captures the phrase from a lounge crooner and loops it.</p><p>
    
    The remaining nine tracks on this 15-minute release are mostly
    collages, with only hints of instrumentation added throughout.
    ""Meditation Outtakes"" plucks all occurrences of the word ""meditation""
    from a speech and lays them end-to-end, demonstrating the way meaning
    changes with minute changes in inflection. ""Of the Word God"" uses the
    same technique with ""god,"" sourcing this time from a woman preacher's
    sermon. You can follow the story she presents through the emphasis on
    this single word, beginning quietly and moving steadily toward a
    histrionic scream. Even though they consist mostly of voices removed
    from their original context and carefully edited, these odds and ends
    actually demonstrate rather well one of the things that makes the
    Books so distinctive: their ear for the musicality of the spoken word.</p></div>"|857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/857-music-for-a-french-elevator/|7.2|Mark Richardson

I thought I could toss Adam Green, erstwhile of early
    '00s anti-folkers Moldy Peaches, following the stiff shock-value yucks
    and self-satisfied cabaret smirks of his 2005 full-length
    <em>Gemstones</em>. But on his latest solo album, <em>Jacket Full of
    Danger</em>, the New York eccentric at last fully immerses himself in
    vulgarity-- in the scummy bilge water of language and culture. Like
    the hapless beer-run guy trapped in ""express"" checkout behind some
    69-items-or-more Daddy's girl, I can't help but enjoy perusing the
    headlines, even if I wouldn't quite take the thing home.</p><p>
    
    See, Green digs trash. Crissakes he once covered ""Kokomo"". So this
    time douchebag goes all the way with the string section his last album
    dropped. He frolics in a rancid NashVegas compost heap of rhinestone
    cowboys and dope-addled wash-outs; indeed, after a Rupert Holmes drum
    fill, opener ""Pay the Toll"" escapes into magical Glen Campbell
    bombast. ""How many drugs does it take to find
    something to do?"" Green croons, a recurring career theme echoed to
    assier effect in the disappointingly adolescent ""Drugs"". ""Party Line""
    serenades a prostitute amid similarly glitzy scenery. Whiskey-period
    Jim Morrison track ""White Women"" turns Green's former dumbfuck tricks,
    but it also reprises a tiki-bar backing chant from the truly bizarre
    ""C Bird"". Hey, trash sells.</p><p>
    
    Occasionally, Green chases the skirt of his fucked-up muse someplace
    actually revelatory. ""Fellas in umbrellas in the middle of the night/
    What you gonna do when the Mennonites bite?"" he sings on ""Novotel"", a
    dizzy minute-and-a-half organ jaunt that calls out Isaac Asimov's Pete
    Doherty pastime (hint rhymes with ""rack""). Acoustic closer ""Hairy
    Women"" hypocritically bemoans the fate of ladies with characteristics
    widely deemed unattractive: ""I have praise for every fantasy that
    braves a hairy nipple."" On first single ""Nat King Cole"", Green's
    brassy vibrato neatly evokes fat aloha Elvis, spewing absurdities
    before lurching into his name-dropping chorus. John Leguizamo gets a
    mention, too. Celebrity call-outs are no surprise from the guy who paid
    ironic homage to mammary icon Jessica Simpson, but here they're
    finally funny. ""Bob Dylan is a vegetable's wife,"" Green sings with
    unlikely aptness, like found poetry from <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em>
    or <em>Weekly World News</em>.</p><p>
    
    The aggressively banal orchestral arrangements and cornball baritone
    make <em>Jacket Full of Danger</em> something like a rakish Scott Walker
    for the post-Beck era. Lest you doubt Green's cred, there's also a
    not-that-innocent Beat Happening cover. Green's lowest notes sometimes recall
    buddy Julian Casablancas' recent because-I-can barrel-scrapes. What
    the album's other, lesser songs point out: Green, that stoned
    motherfucker, possesses a unique patchwork vision of warped mass
    nostalgia. But he only intermittently gets it all in focus. Oh, the
    country he's huge in, again? They coined the word ""kitsch"".</p></div>"|3628.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3628-jacket-full-of-danger/|6.9|Marc Hogan

Whenever it rang, I jumped. Picking it up with a trepidant hand, I tried to quickly discern the caller's tone of voice, fearing the worst news. Whether intentionally or not, the line quoted above, from Band of Horses' debut album, <em>Everything All the Time</em>, perfectly evokes that  particular anxiety.  It's a sad line for any song, but Band of Horses singer Ben Bridwell's delivery isn't mopey or self-absorbed-- there are no intimate acoustic guitars or whispery male vocals accompanying these words.  Instead, he belts them over soaring guitars and extroverted chords, all tempered with a stoicism that staves off histrionics.  Turning despondency into indie majesty is a major talent of Band of Horses; their music is carefully balanced to evoke specific emotional responses while allowing space for personal projection.</p><p>  More elemental than the lush dream-pop of Bridwell and Mat Brooke's former band Carissa's Wierd (the duo played all the instruments here before fleshing out the band with backing musicians), Band of Horses' sound will be immediately, invitingly familiar to anyone who reads this site regularly.  Their guitar-heavy sound and Bridwell's echo-y vocals invite specific comparisons to labelmates the Shins as well as My Morning Jacket, and more general similarities can be noted with forebears such as Neil Young and the Ocean Blue. While apt, these comparisons seem restrictive and reductive, but their limitations can be illuminating. On quieter songs such as ""St. Augustine"", Bridwell recalls Jim James' reverb-heavy vocals, but he lacks the defining regional drawl; as a result, Band of Horses seem placeless.  Where the Shins coil their songs tightly to spring out at the choruses, Bridwell and Brooke's tracks sprawl languorously-- more atmospheric than hooky, but nevertheless too structured and targeted to be considered jammy.</p><p>  Band of Horses' alternately lucid and obscure songwriting remains life-size, even as their guitars swell beyond the everyday. Album centerpiece ""The Great Salt Lake"" begins with a jangly guitar that suggests early R.E.M., lying low to the ground during the verses until the chorus takes off. They also successfully work that contrast between earthbound and airborne on ""The Funeral"" and ""Monsters"", with its rickety banjo carving a rough path for a climactic finale.</p><p>  Of course, if all of <em>Everything</em> strove for such catharsis, the repetition of builds and releases would become tedious and cheap.  Wisely, Band of Horses show off a much broader dynamic, peppering the album with rangier numbers like ""The First Song"" and the churning, catchy ""Wicked Gil"". ""Weed Party"", the album's most upbeat track, even begins with what sounds like a spontaneous and genially goofy ""yeee-haw!""  Still, every element and track on <em>Everything</em> contributes to the album's wistful, twilit atmosphere, from its first cascading guitar chords to its final rueful strums. And instead of closing with the slow crescendo of ""Monsters"", they go out on a quieter note with ""St. Augustine"", a gently ebbing tune featuring both Horses singing together, Bridwell's higher-pitched voice anchored by Brooke's low whisper.  So the album's not as grim as that introductory quotation would imply; the band's downheartedness is always offset by a sense of hope.  As Bridwell sings on ""Monsters"", ""If I am lost it's only for a little while.""</p><p>  Though Band of Horses aren't likely to be heralded as trailblazers, they do sound quietly innovative and genuinely refreshing over the course of these 10 sweeping, heart-on-sleeve anthems.  Ultimately, the band's most winning trait is its delicate balance of elements-- between gloom and promise, quiet and loud, epic and ordinary, familiar and new, direct and elliptical, artist and listener.  Each of these aspects makes the others sound stronger and more complex, making <em>Everything All the Time</em> an album that's easy to get lost in and even easier to love.</p><p> </p></div>"|1200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1200-everything-all-the-time/|8.8|Stephen M.

So Eef Barzelay begins his first solo album, <i>Bitter Honey. But before you get visions of the bespectacled indie folkster shaking his rump at the camera, the Clem Snide frontman makes it clear that he's in character. He's speaking for an anonymous video extra, a faceless woman reduced to a bobbing buttocks captured in close-up. It's potentially problematic, a white man speaking for a black woman, and the first verse is a caricature, with Barzelay singing, ""All those hoochie skanks ain't gotten shit on me/ And one of Nelly's bodyguards he totally agreed."" Barzelay, however, uses that distance between singer and subject-- between male and female, black and white, indie folk and mainstream hip-hop-- to generate a poignant sort of empathy. It's not long before he's fleshing out the cartoon, tracing her life from working-class childhood to her attempt at nursing school: ""but all those broken bodies they really got to me."" It's her fear of death that drives her to flaunt her body, and Barzelay presents her as sympathetic and contradictory, naïve in her world-weariness: ""Don't hate me 'cause I know just what this world is all about.""</i></p><p>
    Once the song ends, Barzelay leaves the hip-hop world behind for the quotidian quarrels and never-speak-aloud daydreams that plague long-term relationships. On ""N.M.A. (Nothing Means Anything)"" an innocent question-- ""What was that actress's name?""-- prompts an argument that's pathetic for being so banal: ""I watched as you picked at your food and so perfectly darkened the mood."" That mood is indeed dark, especially on ""Words That Escape Me"". Barzelay imagines his lover's death in a car accident, ""just to see how I would look by the ambulance light with a grief-stricken face and the thought that we've never been closer."" The spare acoustic setting only makes the sentiment more self-consciously self-absorbed.</p><p>
    Not everything on <i>Bitter Honey is so grim, fortunately. ""Thanksgiving Waves"" churns a great bit of intensity despite being just Barzelay and his guitar, as he imagines traveling again once this war is over. The short ""Little Red Dot"" sounds crisp like early springtime, and not just because of the ambient birdsong. And the closer, a nearly a cappella version of ""Joy to the World"", in this context sounds like a sweet sexual metaphor between a masculine king and a feminine Earth. Wisely, Barzelay downplays the easy pun in the line ""the Lord is come"" for the weightier and orgasmic physical response: ""Fields and floods, rocks hills and plains repeat the sounding joy!""</i></p><p>
    When they settle down domestically, many rock artists seem to lose some of their spark, their hard-won happiness diluting the angst that made them so compelling in the first place. But on <i>Bitter Honey, Barzelay thrives on the secret fears that lie beneath the surface of even the most secure relationships, torn by unwanted thoughts of personal freedom and suspicions that warmth and happiness are ultimately hollow and meaningless. ""Love's the most tender illusion,"" he sings on ""Let Us Be Naked"", sounding resigned never to know if that's a good or a bad thing, a beautiful lie or a foolish dupe. That insoluble dilemma makes this modest album surprisingly substantial.</i></p></div>"|1201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1201-bitter-honey/|7.2|Stephen M. Deusner

Just the opening notes of ""Mexican Broads"" set the tone for <em>Hello</em>: a moseying bass line, a few cute Casio keyboard squiggles that hover like gnats in summer, then some cutting chords from impatient guitars. Singer Kris Barratt delivers an irreverent and sing-songy line like he's really pleased with himself to be British, adding a level of charm and guile to a familiar 90s sound. You may read Beach Boys comparisons elsewhere, but it sounds a whole lot like later Blur, right down to the falsetto backing vocals in ""Broads"" and later ""Comet Tails"".</p><p>
    
    What's strange is that, even with all these tools in their arsenal, few of the songs on <em>Hello</em> deliver on the promise of their parts. The band switches from jagged angst to self-satisfied giggles with ease, and tracks like ""First Base"" wield on the keyboards just as aggressively as guitars, showing patent disregard for subtlety. But amidst all the bubbly enthusiasm, slacker charm, and layered ""la-la-la's,"" good ideas get lost in the jumble. There's something jarring and graceless about the transitions in ""Supergirls"" or ""Shinjuku 5"", on which several competent hooks <em>are</em> sewn together like patchwork without any single one leaving an impression. By the time one gets to ""Carly"", the melodies fired away at automatic clip, it starts to feel workmanlike. Perhaps it's just too much of a good thing. It sounds brilliant while it's playing, but damned if I can remember one tune from the album the moment it's over. Songs like ""Regional Heats"", from their debut EP <em>Taste</em>, were irresistibly catchy; ""Mexican Broads"" might be the only track on <em>Hello</em> that lands a hook.</p><p>
    
    There are some surprises towards the album's latter half, when the energy lags and the boys get introspective. The sugary Blur/Beulah mix of ""Comet Tails"" sounds both proud and bruised at once. ""Tightly Wound"" flirts with surf rock and recalls the Offspring's ""Come Out and Play"" a little too closely, but ""Stately Homes"" is an unpretentious and unadorned strum-happy sing-along. Closing track ""Sun Roof"" sounds downright ethereal, even. These few moments are cracks in the band's joyous but rote veneer. For now, call <em>Hello</em> a fine stick of gum and the Capes a band to keep an eye on, because they're certainly capable of more.</p></div>"|1829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1829-hello/|6.6|Jason Crock

Listening to Treacy's signature puppy/schoolboy voice-- the most vulnerable voice in the world-- and clocking the humor and whimsy scattered across those records, you'd hardly expect the guy to turn out a rock-star casualty; he's a twee-pop touchstone, not a sweaty romantic. But drug problems (and mental ones) don't much care for those distinctions. By the 90s, Treacy was missing and presumed dead; when he turned up this decade, it was while doing time on an English prison boat. When he was released, and told his friends he'd been writing songs all along, a lot of machinery sprang into motion to make this album possible-- from fans raising cash for studio time to the Brit rock label Domino signing the Television Personalities to its roster. Their press release calls the band ""the original Babyshambles,"" but this particular wreck is a lot more human than stylish.</p><p>The first track we heard from this turned out to be perfect. The re-recorded version on the album is titled ""I Hope You're Happy Now"", and it's exactly the kind of song Treacy's always shined on-- languid, unassuming, unguarded, shambling-along guitar-pop, recorded in the kind of warm, naturalistic way not much heard these days. It was also perfectly placed in the Treacy story: The original title was ""I Hope He's Everything You Wanted Me to Be"", and the sense of fatigue, resignation, and disappointment in his vocals was awfully easy to connect with. Everyone must have been hoping that prison time had netted a whole record's worth of songs like this-- well-crafted, forlorn, and with a whole lot of very serious things to say, an unpremeditated ""real deal"" collection of intensely human stuff. A whole lot of people write a whole lot of earnest songs on guitars; sometimes it's nice to hear some that feel like one of them is genuinely struggling to express something honest.</p><p>  But not quite. <em>My Dark Places</em> doesn't just uncover shadowy corners in its subject matter-- it's also musically unkempt, stumbling along and veering off in directions most bands wouldn't even be comfortable using as B-sides or jokes. ""All the Young Children on Crack"" consists mostly of a spare drumbeat repeating while Treacy sings the title-- interwoven with some fumbling handclaps and acoustic guitar wanders. ""Ex-Girlfriend Club"" is actively creepy, with Treacy speaking as the club's tour guide (""Help yourself to the salad bar"") before singing bits of ""Uptown Top Ranking"", running in an odd sampled break, and talking about Puff Daddy over shapeless piano lines. Some tracks seem improvised, thrown-together, Treacy half-singing off a lyric sheet as the instruments around him try to find something interesting to do. Fans-only references abound: paisley shirts and miniskirts, ""paradise is for the blessed,"" etc. Even the best songs aren't prime-time performances-- they're shambling in a worrying way, as if they only just barely managed to get themselves recorded at all.</p><p>  When the songs are good, though, that quality is what provides a lot of the charm-- which has often been the way with this band. And a lot of these tracks turn out to be incredible. ""She Can Stop Traffic"" captures lots of things: the raw romantic enthusiasm of this act; the boyish, starry-eyed quality that comes out when the band ""rocks""; and the wit and the pain both, which Treacy combines over the ending fade. (""She can stop traffic,"" he sings, ""and she's mine. Or she was."") On tracks like ""Dream the Sweetest Dreams"", it's just the sound of the act that makes this so great-- these recordings aren't ""lo-fi,"" but they're unadorned, in-the-room, full of a wide-open warmth, a slack human quality, and voices that leave them feeling spectacularly intimate. Considering that you get the same feeling from the lyrics, it's easy to see how the band's fans will be taken with this even in the moments where it's close to being a musical disaster: You forgive those things the way you might with your best friend's band. And as you listen more, a lot more of the record reveals itself as not so disastrous at all. This is a strange kind of ""difficult"" pop, where songs that first seem hard to listen to gradually take shape and acquire potent emotional effects.</p><p>  On a few of these songs-- where Treacy plays his songs on piano, maybe accompanying his voice with a melodica-- that's exactly what's on offer: Whatever the quality of the music and the performance, there's an incredible amount of emotion that winds up coming through. (See ""There's No Beautiful Way to Say Goodbye"".) And whether Treacy's music is working or not, the one thing he always has working for him is the uniqueness of his approach; now more than ever, this sounds like pretty much nothing else, and in a way that's entirely unpremeditated. The most vulnerable voice in the world makes for the most vulnerable album in the world, and it's largely a train wreck-- but there are very good reasons to hope that Treacy stays well and keeps at it.</p></div>"|8975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8975-my-dark-places/|6.7|Nitsuh Abebe

So it comes as little surprise to hear the duo's easy compatibility on their first joint effort <em>The Black Dove</em>. The album comfortably fits Kraus' distinctive, Oxford-bred vocals into settings of refracted Americana that recall such acts as Califone or Iron &amp; Wine, and proves to be that rare collaboration that is equally beneficial to each of its participants.</p><p>
    
    With a voice as clear and bracing as a stream of pure-grain spirits, Kraus' work on her previous solo albums echoes that of singers like Shirley Collins, Karen Dalton, or Sandy Denny, her songs steeped in the sturdiest British and Appalachian balladic tradition. Kiefer, meanwhile, has made more varied, experimental use of traditional music, ranging from his 2002 minimalist Dust Bowl epic <em>Exodust</em> to the stilted western dioramas of 2003's <em>Medicine Show</em>. Writing together via e-mail, the two eventually were able to craft <em>The Black Dove</em> in a week of feverish creation. As with any such new partnership, the album is not without its tentative moments, but together these two manage to highlight several captivating, previously unforeseen aspects in one another's music. Outfitted with a cache of guitars, banjos, pump organs, and strings, Kiefer provides the arrangements to these songs with unsettling, sinister cross-currents that Kraus' earlier albums have only whispered at.</p><p>
    
    A Ph.D student in American literature at UC-Davis, Kiefer has shown a preference in his work for the sustained, libretto-like narrative. And <em>The Black Dove</em> is no exception, as these 15 tracks are loosely united around the fragmented account of an obsessive, doomed love affair that extends to the grave and beyond. Needless to say, the album's themes of lost love and spiritual estrangement are mother's milk for an accomplished balladeer like Kraus, and such songs as the Dock Boggs-like ramble ""Missing"" or the hymn-paced ""The Blackest Crow"" sound as ageless and irreducible as a column of hickory smoke.</p><p>
    
    Though <em>The Black Dove</em> opens with a deceptively tranquil prelude of flute and guitar, it isn't long before the album begins its grim, fatalistic cycle. ""On the Chase"" finds Kraus casting heart-shaped messages to the four winds, the narrator's romantic desire turning to bleak desperation over an atmospheric backwoods creak akin to Tom Waits' <em>Bone Machine</em>. This haunted rusticism continually peeks through the fissures of tracks like the conflicted ""Letting Go, Holding On"" and ""A Snake &amp; a Lion"", before the tale's arc comes to an electrifying crescendo on the self-explanatory ""Mourning,"" a spirited dirge laced with a furious bolt of Bad Seeds/ Dirty Three violin.</p><p>
    
    Although Kiefer is certainly a capable vocalist in his own right, the album's energy flags noticeably when he takes the microphone on ""Cold Blue Room"" or ""Dearest"", tracks that venture unpleasantly close to alt-country convention. Instead <em>The Black Dove</em> is best served when he sticks to edging Kraus' forceful voice with refined shade and color, or when he helps deliver such crucial instrumental interludes as the exquisite woodwind figures of ""The Rocks"", upon which the album's subjects take their final bow. Fortunately for all involved, Kiefer and Kraus survive <em>The Black Dove</em> in much better shape than the ill-fated lovers of their narrative, leaving the listener only to hope that this album signals the beginning of a long and mutually rewarding musical partnership.</p></div>"|4609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4609-the-black-dove/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

Usually the first disk or two contains everything you really need, and the last disks are full of late-career tracks that are highlights only compared to the songs that were omitted. Whether through the Pretenders' talent or by the compilers' design, <em>Pirate Radio-- which is the band's first multidisk retrospective and a long time coming-- showcases a band that held onto its gritty gift for crafting complex songs with sharp melodic lines and smart(ass) lyrics. There are some duds here, but the high ratio of rockers to clunkers remains remarkably consistent across all four disk, which is no mean feat considering the Pretenders have been in an almost constant state of turnover since their very first album.</em></p><p>
    
    Seemingly an ideal band for a box set like this, the Pretenders made at least one great album (their self-titled debut), a few good albums, and a couple of releases that are generously described as ""for-fans-only"". However, they were best song by song-- not just singles like ""Don't Get Me Wrong"" or ""Night in My Veins"", but album tracks like ""Thumbelina"" and ""Bad Boys Get Spanked"" as well. Collected together, these 81 songs-- presented in rough chronological order across four disks and complemented with a DVD of mostly lip-synced live appearances-- rarely ever sound dated. Furthermore, listening to them doesn't require any sort of trendy nostalgia for the late 70s or early 80s. <em>Pirate Radio</em>, in other words, proves more than simply artifactual: While even its weakest tracks contribute to its historical/biographical scope, the set proves an imminently listenable, often kick-ass collection.</p><p>
    
    The Pretenders were post-punk chronologically, if not aesthetically. An ex-pat from Akron, singer Chrissie Hynde hung out with the Sex Pistols, scribed for <em>NME</em>, and clerked at Malcolm McLaren's notorious Sex shop. She was also desperate to be ""in a band,"" a need so strong the liner notes suggest it's pathological. So she hooked up with four guys from Hereford and formed the Pretenders just as punk was fizzling out. They fed off punk's visceral energy, but Hynde was too much of a fervent believer in capital-R Rock to buy into its nihilism. Also, while most other post-punk bands were experimenters and tinkerers, she was (and remains) a traditionalist, refining instead of redefining rock. Their modest goal, which they handily achieved, was to be a really good rock band: tight, inventive, aggressive, goofy, gutsy, and-- perhaps most important-- with a particular sound that could be readily identified as the Pretenders. They laid it all out on their self-titled 1979 debut, which includes some of their best songs: the country-inflected ""Kid"", the motorbike beat of ""Tattooed Love Boys"", the inimitable vocals and slangy lyrics on ""Brass in Pocket"", the show-closing ""Mystery Achievement"". People don't buy and comb through every lyric and riff of this album the same way they do <i>Power, Corruption, and Lies or <em>Entertainment!</em>, but it's aged just as gracefully, retaining its original power.</i></p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, a surprising eclecticism is encoded into the Pretenders' DNA, the byproduct of their transatlantic line-up and Hynde's coming-of-age to American radio. <em>Pirate Radio</em> includes convincing country songs like ""Tequila"", Bo Diddley rumbles like ""Cuban Slide"", shameless balladry like ""I'll Stand By You"", American soul numbers like their cover of ""Thin Line Between Love and Hate"", and blue-eyed soul songs like ""977"" (which borrows its melody from ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted?""). They could easily be gaudy and goofy (""The Adultress"") and maudlin (""Birds of Paradise"" or ""I'll Stand By You"", take your pick), but they treat all these styles as if they're all logical bedfellows under the Rock umbrella.</p><p>
    
    Connecting all these disparate stylistic elements is Hynde's singular bravado, a vocal delivery both masculine and feminine, aggressive yet controlled, brash yet vulnerable-- contradictions that serve the song first and her persona second. Her voice has a crystalline quality that arcs tenderly on ""Kid"" and ""2000 Miles"", but she frequently launches into a kind of jive singspeak, rushing through her syllables without losing the meter. She can sell a line as mushy as ""I'm thinking of the fireworks that go off when you smile"" as persuasively as a raunchy line like ""You've got your chest on my back across a new Cadillac-oh yeah."" From the very first track on <em>Pirate Radio</em> through the very last, she maintains a complex and often contradictory front. In this regard, the television and concert clips on the DVD could potentially complement the music and portray another side of Hynde, but most of the material consists of awkward performances in which she either lip-syncs poorly or tries way too hard. Only the mid-80s concert footage of ""Middle of the Road"" hints at her considerable stage presence.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, Hynde is the only constant throughout <em>Pirate Radio</em>'s four disks, just as she was the only constant in the Pretenders. Original members Pete Farndon and James Honeyman Scott both OD'd (Farndon after being booted from the band, Scott after a night of pub hopping), and drummer Martin Chambers was fired, then rehired a few years later. Hynde carried on for years under the Pretenders moniker, never going solo; that's less a heroic act that a manifestation of her need to belong to a band, even if it allegedly inspired the hit ""Back on the Chain Gang"", which is reportedly about keeping the band together after Scott died. We should all be so lucky to have a memorial as lovely as Hynde's ""oh-oh-woa-whoa-whoa"" that punctuates each line of the verse. So <em>Pirate Radio</em> naturally rises and falls with her whims, and while it may have been tighter with three instead of four disks, the set shows an artist who helped to create and sustained a sound that has made the Pretenders stand out among nearly thirty years' worth of bands. The audience may have shrunk, but the songs remain the same.</p></div>"|6595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6595-pirate-radio/|8.2|Stephen M. Deusner

Initially, the seven tracks on his new record seem to play like fugitives from disparate orphanages, each with its own ambitions and sense of style. But they are linked by, of all things, an evangelical urgency: McBean self-consciously blends Satan-fearing Louvin Brothers sentiments with the Velvet Underground's narco-messianism and heavy doses of the 1970s California Jesus Movement's rhetoric/vibe.</p><p>
    
    The bible-fondling is a feint, though (I think), an allusive backdrop against which McBean worries about contemporary political turmoil. Take ""Comas"", for example: McBean's catalog is on a pace to out-reference Dan Bejar's, and here he rejects AC/DC's mantra outright: ""No, I'm not headed down a highway to hell."" War-and-peace imagery follows, but the chorus surrenders to la-la scatting. Some message is being telegraphed: the horny first Pink Mountaintops EP never sat around strumming Banhart's guitar, engineering the fingertip-slides as loudly as the vocals. Either we have a new babysitter, or the old one has been mellowed by 24-hour news and feels guilty about his slutty past.</p><p>
    
    During ""Cold Criminals"", a beep, like the ones on old storybook-record combos that signaled a page-turn, re-begins the riff. The bass is Black Mountain funk, and the guitar is VU-slop, but an effect sounds like planes taking off. Is this more than the requisite Smog shout-out (see Callahan's ""Ex-Con"", and note how the last Pink Mountaintops' ""Tourist In Your Town"" seemed to wink at ""I Was A Stranger"")? Is Halliburton or Enron in McBean's sights? Is the refrain, ""Devil got us in his plans,"" a rebuff to fundamentalist conservative broadcaster/prognosticators such as the Van Impes, who cast us (North Americans) as the heroes in an apocalyptic fantasia? </p><p>
    
    ""New Drug Queens"": Okay, the chorus is ""Tell your Mama don't stay out late tonight,"" which seems to be shushing the Scissor Sisters, or appropriating Glenn Danzig's famous maternal taunt. ""Slaves"" follows, and McBean sounds like he's trying to talk PJ Harvey out of hanging out in the desert with that Stone Age guy. It's nine minutes of hurdy-gurdy spiral-tribal hokey-pokey propulsion, maybe the redawn of threat-gospel. ""Plastic Man, You're The Devil"": As if cast in an indie-tastic homage to <em>Trading Places</em>, Mr. Lif the agitprop rapper has recently dropped a nasty sex rhyme, and the formerly smutty Pink Mountaintops have recorded a progressive ballad? McBean is either inserting a comic book character into the Freudian drama between God, Mary, and Jesus, or if he's using plasticity the way Devo did, as shorthand for the high-and-tight corporate/government un-man. By the end of the tune, the speaker's pacifism has waned into vigilante pragmatism. </p><p>
    
    ""Lord Let Us Shine"" is a choir number, but it drops fuzzed-out bar-anthem guitar over minimalist drum-machinery; imagine a Polyphonic Spree clown-carjacked by Andrew WK. Things get all Jason Spaceman by the end (remember that he went stoner-churchy too), and the lyrics cop the Stones for the zillionth time, typecasting them again as the arbiters of the 60s demonic majesty. ""How We Can Get Free"" asks Jesus if he even believes anymore, begging him for a liberating ""holy rage."" Blood spills, and McBean repeats more lines from jukebox classics, but the acoustic plod is undercut by an icy Xiu Xiu synth hit. Listening to the song is not unlike having your neck shaved by a <em>The Deer Hunter</em>-era Christopher Walken in a priest outfit.</p><p>
    
    I surrender: I want to type about <em>Axis of Evol</em> until Armageddon, but my flesh is weak. This EP contains more interesting complications than I am capable of harnessing by deadline; I feel like McBean is going to show up at the Pitchfork office as a reaping angel, and I won't be ready, and there won't be time to repent. What are these songs about partying, warfare, and holiness trying to do? Is McBean envisioning a neu-hippie version of <em>Left Behind</em>? Is he speaking in tongues with his tongue in his cheek? Most importantly, how and why is this piledrivingly unsubtle delivery of bleak Dylanesque cosmology so hott? In his book <em>American Jesus</em>, Stephen Prothero details how one of the ""dangerous directions"" of the Jesus Movement was toward ""Flirty Fishing,"" or using ""sex as a recruiting technique"" for the Lord. Consider me seduced.</p></div>"|6565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6565-axis-of-evol/|8.1|William Bowers

The duo put their own stamp on the White Stripes two-person set-up, locating a slightly different power in a similarly messy minimalism, and that opener sets up some high expectations for deadboy and the Elephantmen's debut, not least of which is that there would be more than one Elephantman backing deadboy.</p><p>
    
    That tricky moniker aside, Riggs and Brunet thwart those raised expectations with the second track, ""No Rainbow"", a meandering, tune-deficient acoustic number featuring a tacked-on caterwauling coda. The song stalls the momentum out completely, and like a sputtering hot rod, <em>We Are Night Sky</em> takes a while to get revved and roaring again. But even when it's moving, there's always the threat that the album will stall out and leave you stranded.</p><p>
    
    On ""How Long the Night Was"", Riggs and Brunet pound a murky guitar riff into a rousingly anthemic chorus. Too bad it's in service of a song that consists mainly of Riggs repeating the line ""If you were dreaming you know how long the night was."" He's overly fond of such nocturnal motifs-- not really imagery, just empty declarations-- and lyrical repetitions based on blues song structures. But where most blues songs cap that repetition with another line to deepen or offset earlier lines, Riggs simply repeats his lyrics without resolving them. There's a potential power in those repetitions, but typically Riggs' proclamations are clunky and vague where they strive to be meaningful and evocative. On ""Ancient Man"", he sings, ""I envy the night/ For its absence of light,"" but the statement is far too cryptic to be consequential.</p><p>
    
    After a rocky start, the album moves through some severe ups and downs: impressive highs amid oppressive lows. As a general rule, as the tempos pick up, so does the album, but whenever Riggs pulls out his acoustic and slows things down, <em>We Are Night Sky</em> coughs to a stop. ""Blood Music"" careens wildly, as if the brakes and steering have failed, and the thundering ""Kissed by Lightning"" and ""Misadventures of Dope"" are scalding swamp boogies with heavy-metal bluster reminiscent of Riggs's previous band, Acid Bath. Unfortunately, these tracks are interspersed with downtempo numbers like ""Dressed in Smoke"" and ""Evil Friend"" that trail off without much drama.</p><p>
    
    It's not that quieter moments would be unwelcome, but on <em>We Are Night Sky</em>, these songs sound particularly weak, implying that the duo haven't developed much beyond their hard-hitting riffage. With its lo-fi production, ""Break It Off"" has field-recording pretensions, but simply grates. ""Walking Stick"" at least showcases Brunet's ethereal voice, which nicely countervails Riggs' earthy, aggressive vocals, but the song is so whisper-slight that it dissipates like smoke even as you listen. Ultimately, it's enough to make you ditch the hot-rod and walk.</p></div>"|2638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2638-we-are-night-sky/|5.7|Stephen M. Deusner

    me a concussion during a 5th grade production of <em>Damn Yankees</em>. After
    regaining consciousness in the nurse's office, I decided that musical
    theater was too stylized, too rigid, and too corny to justify such
    physical hazards. Years later, prejudices still intact, I first
    discovered the music of the Magnetic Fields, right around the release of
    their hugely successful 3xCD <em>69 Love Songs</em>. Not since that
    fateful grade school play had I fallen so hard so fast. Aside from being
    artful, clever, and stylistically diverse, <em>69 Love Songs</em> managed to be profoundly
    moving without falling back on dour poet-auteur poses. Soon, I found myself singing along in a voice I hadn't
    used for a long time; clearly, I had made the kind of error in judgment
    that only comes of blunt head trauma.</p><p>
    
    While <em>Showtunes</em> is technically Magnetic Fields frontman Stephin
    Merritt's first time writing music for the stage, his work has always
    drawn extensively from musical theater, both in style and in concept.
    <em>69 Love Songs</em> was originally conceived as a stage play, and probably
    warranted a producer credit for Merritt; aside from writing and
    arranging the album, Merritt cast a number of extremely talented
    singers to perform several of his songs. <em>Showtunes</em>, a collection of
    25 songs written by Merritt for three plays directed by Chen
    Shi-Zheng, features several of the same vocalists Merritt recruited for
    <em>69 Love Songs</em>, and the strongest melodies Merritt has penned since
    that album's release.</p><p>
<em>Showtunes</em> is an oddly sequenced collection, jumping between songs from
    the three Merritt-Shi-Zheng collaborations. As such, it is extremely
    difficult to discern how Merritt's songs fit within the broader
    narratives of these three plays; I can only assume that the emphasis
    here is meant to be placed squarely on the songs themselves. As is to be
    expected, Merritt's arrangements are impeccable, making excellent use of
    traditional Chinese instruments as well as marimba, steel drum, and
    ukulele. That said, I'm not entirely convinced that this is the best way
    to present these songs; the live-sounding recordings don't always bring
    out the full force of the material, and create a sense of continuity
    that is only undercut by the album's sequencing.</p><p>
    
    Merritt's contributions to the two narrative plays adapted by Shi-Zheng
    prove to be the strongest songs on <em>Showtunes</em>. The two-part ""Shall We
    Sing a Duet?"" from <em>Peach Blossom Fan</em> is my personal favorite.
    Merritt's word choice is playful and precise, clever in its rhymes
    and syntax but ruthlessly effective in the story and emotions conveyed.
    Progressing from simple alternating verses to a serpentine round
    structure to a stunning lone verse sung in harmony, ""Shall We Sing a
    Duet?"" tells a story through its words, its melody, and its form.
    Vocalist Shirley Simms absolutely nails her verses, offering
    probably the best vocal performance on <em>Showtunes</em>. ""Sounds Expensive"",
    excellently performed by David Patrick Kelly, narrates the tragicomic
    romantic history of an emerald ring, Kelly hitting every dramatic pause
    with perfect aplomb.</p><p>
    
    Selections from <em>My Life as a Fairy Tale</em>, a non-narrative stage
    adaptation of the works of Hans Christian Andersen, prove more uneven.
    ""The Top and the Ball"" and ""Auntie Toothache"" both charmingly narrate
    conflicts between inanimate objects, the latter unexpectedly segueing
    into a terrifying tale of dentistry-themed torture. There are a few
    clunkers, though; ""The Little Hebrew Girl"", ""The Ugly Little Duck"", and
    ""The Little Maiden of the Sea"" are awkward and overlong. Given that <em>My
    Life as a Fairy Tale</em> is a series of vignettes, the comparative length
    of these songs makes sense, but it's disappointing that Merritt didn't
    do more with such rich source material.</p><p>
    
    In the wake of <em>69 Love Songs</em>, Merritt appeared consistently irked by
    questions of which songs were autobiographical, and rightfully so. One
    of Merritt's greatest strengths is his ability to write
    coherent and compelling voices into his songs, no autobiographical
    justification required. I'm a bit disappointed that <em>Showtunes</em> isn't
    better suited to showcase this particular strength, but the songs
    themselves are nothing to scoff at. Though these songs are a bit more
    stage-y than the bulk of Merritt's work, the difference is one of
    degree, not character. In a sense, Merritt has always been writing
    showtunes; only now, there are shows that go with them. </p></div>"|5240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5240-showtunes/|7.5|Matt LeMay

    enchantress Caroline (last name Lufkin), follows on the heels of her  
    2005 single ""Where's My Love"", a beautiful experiment in  
    minimalist pop arrangements and angelic vocals. <em>Murmurs</em>  
    delivers on the promise shown in that single, utilizing an array of  
    acoustic and electric instruments to create  
    dreamy, delicate textures as a backdrop for her lilting voice. The result is a blend of ethereal pop and ambient IDM that creates an elegant  
    soundscape of atmosphere and mood.</p><p>
    
    The disc opens with quiet, contemplative horns reminiscent of  
    something Gene Wilder would've sung over in <em>Willy Wonka and the  
    Chocolate Factory</em>. As Caroline's voice glides in, she  
    reminisces about a childhood love, and though muted keys and a low,  
    thumping beat carry the tune, it's the horns that define the  
    nostalgic mood. ""Pink &amp; Black"" introduces a more dynamic rhythm, with  
    a glitchy beat, tinkling piano, and layered vocal harmonies.</p><p>
    
    ""Where's My Love"" appears here again, retaining all of its gentle  
    beauty. Though it sounds like a lullaby, the vocals are at once sad  
    and hopeful, the inner thoughts of a heart longing to find love.  
    ""Everylittlething"" follows, and contains some of this disc's darker  
    moments. Driving, distorted synths are almost enough to push the  
    track into dance territory, but the quiet mood and soft refrain keep  
    one foot grounded in the same realm as Caroline's more subtle  
    moments. On ""All I Need"", she shows off her vocal range,  
    complimenting her own lines with deeper, darker words and phrases. </p><p>
    
    Carolie's ability to sneak in unexpected splashes of different sounds-- whether  
    a moment of anger in an otherwise serene song, or a moment of  
    hope in an otherwise sad tune-- gives <em>Murmurs</em> its strength.  
    Many of the album's best moments are not immediate but take  
    multiple listens to make themselves known. Therefore, it's not just  
    the subtle beauty in her voice that makes Caroline unique, but also  
    her gift for using quiet ambience as a key element in these  
    intricate, layered arrangements. </p></div>"|1830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1830-murmurs/|7.8|Cory D. Byrom

With the release of last year's <em>Codex Teenage Premonition</em>, add Scotland's Fire Engines to the list of post-punk acts basking in the glow of renewed interest.</p><p>
    
    Formed in 1979, the Fire Engines counted Josef K and Orange Juice among their domestic contemporaries, but their penchant for furious noise and repetition placed them closer to England's Swell Maps or even American No Wave than the Postcard sound. Neither their debut LP, <em>Lubricate Your Living Room</em>, nor the comprehensive compilation of their studio output, <em>Fond</em>, have been in print for more than a decade, so the band's legacy seemed destined to be forgotten. But then in 2004, Franz Ferdinand-- who clearly learned a thing or two about angular guitar riffs and self-deprecating lyrics from the Fire Engines-- tapped the band to open for them on tour. The pairing resulted in a split 7"" in which Franz Ferdinand covered the Engines' first single, ""Get Up and Use Me"", while the reunited Fire Engines turned in a deranged rendition of Franz Ferdinand's ""Jacqueline"". At times unrecognizable, the Engines' version threatens to totally fall apart, mocking the airtight performance of the original with a haphazard looseness.</p><p>
    
    Comprised of live performances (some of which were recorded by fans), <em>Codex Teenage Premonition</em> would be entirely superfluous were it not for the fact that the rest of the band's catalogue remains out of print. The band is captured in blisteringly raw form, but without studio polish or proper mixing, we get an extreme picture of the mechanics of the band: fat bass grooves; thin, piercingly hot guitar stabs; and David Henderson's nasal yelps. The sound quality is frustratingly poor throughout, which makes the three bonus tracks particularly redemptive. In addition to ""Jacqueline"", the disc includes two strong tracks taken from a 1981 Peel Session. ""Discord"", which unnecessarily appears three times on the album, is a hypnotically rhythmic workout that boasts a simple, but circuitously fluid bass line and some James White-esque skronk. ""Candyskin"" is the Fire Engines' lone bid for pop stardom, plodding along with the cocksure swagger of the Voidoids and icing the cake with a giddy coda of la la la's.</p><p>
<em>Codex Teenage Premonition</em> is hardly a definitive introduction. But armed with some ragged snapshots of the band live and two excellent Peel outtakes (which will soon be released as a 7"" single), it still makes a strong case for the Fire Engines' inclusion in the periphery of the ever-expanding post-punk canon. But it will take some long overdue reissues of their studio output to elevate them above also-rans.</p></div>"|3361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3361-codex-teenage-premonition/|7.3|John Motley

Not only are Dinosaur Jr. back for reunion tours and catalog reissuing, but my favorite wah-loving stoner is revisiting his Deep Wound and Upsidedown Cross days on the side, drumming for doom quartet Witch.  Mascis handled Dinosaur's thunder toms when Murph wasn't around (see <em>Green Mind</em>), but in Witch, it's his singular role: no blistering solos or perfect ""Freak Scene"" poetry, just airtight rolls and bass-drum thuds.</p><p>
    
    Spanning the psych-metal/folk divide, two of Witch's members also play in the airy Vermont octet Feathers, perhaps known best as the backup crew on Devendra Banhart's anti-war song, ""Heard Somebody Say"" (although their pleasant forthcoming full-length on Gnomonsong should change that).  Here, singer/guitarist Kyle Thomas and guitarist Asa Irons follow the footsteps of folk-rock genre-hoppers like Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny, ably increasing the volume and peeling the tie-dye from the walls.</p><p>
    
    Fans of the legendary SST doom-metal band Saint Vitus will likely find this stuff to be fun, if hardly original.  Just don't confuse them with Swedish Pentagram lovers Witchcraft.  Actually, okay, confuse them if you want: There are plenty of similarities in the rollicking instrumentation and occult lyricism.  The 1970s-style metal cross-referencing would make for a smoking double bill, but Witch inhales more Zeppelin with its Sabbath.  Also, Witch's Thomas sounds nothing like Witchcraft vocalist/guitarist Magnus Pelander; instead, he warbles like Jason Simon of Dead Meadow or, oddly enough, the Apples in Stereo's Robert Schneider.</p><p>
    
    But whatever the proper analogue or crib sheet-- and regardless of the starpower Mascis brings to the proceedings-- the Feathers boys are the stars of Witch: The album's best moments result from the torrid dual guitar solos, the well-textured feedback, and how the heavy atmosphere contrasts with Thomas' sweetly nasal howl.  And that howl is fantastic, especially when Witch aims for epic extrapolations as on the mountainous ""Black Saint"".  He also contributes a supernatural spark to epic opener ""Seer"" (those riffs!) and the rising/falling ""Rip Van Winkle"", which should take 10 years off any self-respecting banger's lifespan.  (It is sorta strange, though, that this Dead Meadow-sounding dude is from Feathers and Dead Meadow's newest album was called <em>Feathers</em>.  Are they sharing the incense and blacklights or what?)</p><p>
    
    Renaissance Faire love song ""Isadora"" provides a pace change with dramatic cymbal washes/crashes and acoustic starlings, but the more expansive stuff works best: ""Soul of Fire""'s boogie, for example, is less appealing than rifftastic ""Changing""'s glorious bongwater drone.  ""Changing"" also inserts resounding Druidic bell tolls and harmonies dipped in the magic circle and zodiac cloak.  And whenever the shit seems to patter into the shadows, a whirlwind of guitar takes off and the boys bong out a few more rounds.  These are such rich landscapes, all mossy and backed with an inked sky, it's like they live in an Arik Roper sunset.</p><p>
    
    Fans of doom and 70s psychedelia have hefty decisions to make these days, so if your budget's limited, here's how things stand on the Sabbath meter: Witch holds my attention more forcefully than the Sword or Pearls &amp; Brass, but less gloriously than Om or Sleep.  There's an energy and charisma in this dosage that I find lacking in some of the younger contemporaries.  Really, it could be totally nerve-wrackingly debilitating to solo and scream in front of an icon of Mascis' stature, but Thomas imparts himself wonderfully.  In fact, by the closing notes of the album's finale, I always forget it's J who's manning the drumkit at all.</p></div>"|8808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8808-witch/|7.6|Brandon Stosuy

    Hellacopters, although that doesn't stop them from proclaiming rock
    defunct in the title of their 10th album. But how's this
    for sad irony-- back when everyone was lamenting grunge or lionizing indie
    slacker rock, these guys had the chutzpah to reintroduce 70s AOR. Now the
    Darkness-led cadre of retro-revivers receive the accolades for their
    supposed trailblazing, though in all fairness, Hellacopters lack more than
    just opportunistic timing in their Sisyphusian task to co-opt arena rock
    to stardom.</p><p>
    
    Armed with the unflagging, soaring vocals of Nicke Andersson and a
    willingness to cram a half-dozen virile riffs into one cramped downbeat,
    the band smugly recaptures their desired aesthetic and too often quits
    there. <em>Rock &amp; Roll</em> only confirms this already steadfast claim,
    showing little to no evolution in the band's material save for perhaps a
    slightly larger ratio of slowed-down, fake Allman Brothers songs to
    cocksure rockers. If you're a lock-and-load, full-throttle rock fan
    though, this album's got your order. Masturbatory guitar solos, cowbells,
    the same damn bridge to every song-- check your highfalutin songwriting at
    the door, son, this ain't thinkin' man's music.</p><p>
    
    Of course, we all need to numb our minds sometimes, and standout tracks
    (in a liberal sense of the term) ""Monkeyboy"" and ""Everything's on TV"" do
    that trick nicely. The former notches most of the hooks on an otherwise
    barren album, almost poppy enough to resemble GBV at their most muscular
    but instead settling for mediocre Springsteen mimicry. A few eons devolved,
    ""Everything's on TV"" flashes a sanctimonious sneer at prodigal viewers (""I
    have a TV screen of some 32 inches/ TV dinner and an easy chair"") and
    resounds about as strongly as the line ""Well I burned all my
    books/ On my ass I sit and look"".</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, more than a decade of fist-pumping hasn't garnered much tooth for
    the band. Opener ""Before the Fall"" sounds as over-the-top plastic as Marty
    McFly's rendition of ""Johnny B. Goode"" in <em>Back to the Future</em> while
    ""soulful"" americana ballads like ""Leave It Alone"" are on a Black Crowes
    level. The precarious divide in revivalist rock today is almost residual
    of Hellacopters' on/off material. For every Darkness or Hives, we get 10
    Jets, and the 'copters canon uncannily reflects this. At this point,
    I'm convinced the band's trapped in some sort of horrible <em>Groundhog
    Day</em>-like time trap, churning out the same fodder until 20 albums
    later maybe, just maybe, they'll reach the year 1977.</p></div>"|3810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3810-rock-roll-is-dead/|5.5|Adam Moerder

    years in a place he once called ""the land of the ice cream and apple
    pie, guns and the Wild West."" With air travel in disarray after 9/11, Ray Davies took his stranded American tour on the anywhere
    American road. During some of the recording of <em>Other People's
    Lives</em>, improbably the ex-Kink's first proper solo album-- his 1985
    soundtrack LP <em>Return to Waterloo</em> and VH1-inspiring 1998
    one-man-show <em>The Storyteller</em> each included previously released
    material-- he lived in New Orleans. The resulting record cleverly
    mires Davies' observational English cynicism in the turbid bayou of
    organ-flecked rocking-chair rock and the American confessional
    singer-songwriter convention.</p><p>
    Now age 62, Davies shares the mortality obsession heard in the latter work
    of similarly graying singer/songwriters like Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond,
    and the late Johnny Cash. At its best, <em>Other People's Lives</em>
    hints that Davies' sunset years may not, contra ""Waterloo"", be
    paradise, as on scratchy-throated shitstorm wake ""After the Fall"",
    scalding breakup/suicide ballad ""All She Wrote"", and soulful,
    incongruously lonely hidden track ""Thanksgiving Day"", also the lead
    single. As with Morrissey-- the Oscar Wilde to Davies' less
    flamboyantly uppercrust-crumbling George Bernard Shaw-- Davies' enduring voice and
    wordplay belie their faceless session backing, here primarily acoustic
    guitar jangle and past-date swamp-rock smolder. The moaning feedback
    and bass throb of importunate opener ""Things Are Gonna Change"" find
    their analogue on the title track of Moz's 1997 <em>Maladjusted</em>.</p><p>
    Yet at times Davies matures backward, trading the Kinks'
    tergiversating sophistication for rash generalization. Yup, he's gone
    native in curmudgeon country. Davies rails against the
    ""continual quest for the fountain youth"" in ""Run Away From Time"",
    lambastes dedicated followers of fashion in ""Stand Up Comic"", and
    complains about that perpetual foe of fogeys and famous dudes alike,
    the Fourth Estate, on the cliché-mongering title track-- ""Can't
    believe what I just read/ Excuse me, I just vomited."" Stoned wailer
    ""The Getaway (Lonesome Train)"" alludes to ""Sunny Afternoon"", Big Easy
    poverty shockah ""The Tourist"" namedrops ""La Vida Loca"", but both staid
    productions could benefit from brother Dave's sibling-rival guitar
    crunch.</p><p>
<em>Other People's Lives</em> is not without its ostensible character
    songs, which nonetheless suggest the title may be a cunning misnomer.
    The <em>Village Green</em> music hall of ""Next Door Neighbor"" purports
    to tell of Joneses, Smiths, and Browns, but published interviews
    indicate the song's events-- running off with an Essex blonde,
    smashing a TV through a window-- happened instead to our humble
    narrator. Similarly, the evocative ""Creatures of Little Faith"" adopts
    a biblical scope for its title and refrain, but depicts petty
    relationship jealousy with the detail of someone who's stared into its
    lurid green eyes. Where many singer/songwriters manipulate the
    first-person specific to convey a false sense of intimacy, Davies uses
    the third person and generality to distance his songs from their
    presumed subjects-- and thus imbues them with particularly
    true-ringing verisimilitude, which by the way tastes just like cherry
    cola.</p></div>"|2640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2640-other-peoples-lives/|6.7|Marc Hogan

    repetitive breakdown or grisly feedback buzz, and they employ a vocalist
    who probably loses his voice after loudly spweing stream-of-horror-consciousness, body-fixated lyrics at every show. Depending on what you've been listening to the past 10 years,
    this will either lead you to start playing
    this kind of music, send you digging into the crates for your old
    Locust records, or both.</p><p>
    
    With some alcohol and jaded friends around, you could play battle of
    the ""celebrity"" hardcore bands, and pit Some Girls (The Locust,
    Unbroken) against Das Oath (Charles Bronson, Coalition Records) or
    Limp Wrist (Los Crudos, Kill The Man Who Questions): I have played
    this game, and Limp Wrist always wins.</p><p>
    
    Here's the thing: dudes want to grow up. Come your late-20s, the adoration of a sea of kids with Crudos back-patches and
    spock-rocked hair means nil. For scene vets like Some Girls, there's been an
    ex-band tag on every flyer they've graced: The band members own labels (bassist Justin Pearson's Three One
    G), maybe own their own houses, and sport fake moustaches (all of
    them). No wonder they're done with childish things like hooks and
    being nice to kids at shows.</p><p>
    
    In punk parlance, we call this the Public Image Ltd. Corollary, and
    discerning listeners will notice ""Religion II"" sitting squarely at
    track 10; ""discerning"" because vocalist Wes Eisold's still got
    something caught in his throat, and the pace only falls off one or two
    tics, though the chorus is can't miss: ""THIS IS RELIGION."" As
    metaphor, it's a pretty explicit one: They're doing the maturity
    thing, but still doing it loudly.</p><p>
    
    ""Ex Nuns/Dead Dogs"" has a Swing Kids wicked down-stroke but idles,
    stuck on the chord till it obliterates the predictable next one: then
    it shows up, breakneck again into blurry guitars and sneered punch
    lines, a yelled heresy: ""Dee eye vee
    oh are see es eye in es tee ee ee pea el ee es oh in ef eye are eek ay
    ee ee pea oh in bee you are in eye in gee em ee,"" nonsense syllables
    not meant to be decoded either by the divine, or by the Locust-jockers
    with ""Get off the Cross, the Wood Is Needed"" tattoos.</p><p>
<i>Heaven's Pregnant Teens</i> is not a favorite song record-- Some
    Girls trade in sonic aesthetics not moments-- plus the lyrics are too scattered to grab and the songs are too short to bother memorizing. It's more of a mood thing, which ought to be deliberate,
    even if it isn't. After all, when's the last time you saw a Brian Eno
    back-patch?</p></div>"|7825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7825-heavens-pregnant-teens/|6.8|Zach Baron

Perhaps you're left lacking by the prospect of hearing 50-year-old men plugging in their amplifiers to compare affairs of the heart to assembling an Ikea Robin media shelf.  Or maybe you already own the Buzzcocks' <em>Singles Going Steady</em> and don't think there's any point seeing what the minds behind evergreen gems like ""What Do I Get?"" or ""Everybody's Happy Nowadays"" are capable  of in the 21st century.  It's a shame, then, that you won't hear how  good they sound on <em>Flat-Pack Philosophy</em>.</p><p>
    
    Yes, the Buzzcocks are doing what they've always done-- writing raucous pop songs-- but there's something to be said for honing and plying one's craft.  If anyone's earned the right to beat
    this dead horse into sniffing glue, it's the firm of Shelley &amp; Diggle, and they beat it like nobody's business.  <em>Flat-Pack Philosophy</em>, the group's seventh full-length, squeezes 14 tunes into just 36 minutes, many of which could give even some <em>Steady</em> moments a run for the filthy lucre.  Hyperbole, sure, but it's hard to argue when the breathless chorus of ""Wish I Never Loved You"" is rattling between your ears long after the song is finished.  That track, emblematic of Pete Shelley's undying hard-luck romanticism, is followed by Steve Diggle's shining moment on this album, ""Sell You Everything"".  Even if the track's message falls a bit flat (see one song title), the music-- all crashing drums and revved-up guitar-- gives it the anthemic punch it requires.</p><p>
    
    The album peaks early with the title track (the one about Ikea) and the aforementioned one-two punch.  There's still plenty to enjoy on the back end, though.  In fact, the only truly sour track is ""Sound of a Gun"", Diggle's attempt to add some gruff toughness to the Buzzcocks' zippy veneer; the group is at its best these days when melding a youthful exuberance with time-worn maturity.  A potentially dreadful track like ""Credit""-- another ""woe is the financial state of the world"" polemic, complete with voices sampled from an automated supermarket checkout kiosk and oh-so-topical complaints about cell phones and junk mail-- is saved by Shelley's wistful chorus (""Credit/ In love with the never never/ Wish I could get something I really need"").  While the more socially aware songs come off somewhat out of touch (cell phones? really?), life experience can only help when you're writing pop songs about love.</p><p>
    
    Musically, the breezy gait of ""I Don't Exist"" peacefully co-exists with the more emphatic rock tones of ""Soul Survivor"", and the strength of the music behind these tracks rescues them from any glaring lyrical skidmarks.  Conversely, close listens to otherwise enjoyable tunes like ""Between Heaven &amp; Hell"" and ""God, What Have I Done"" might kill one's buzz.  Still, most rough patches are smoothed over by the album's overall consistency.  Perhaps the notion of a rock band-- let alone a punk rock band-- punching the very same clock they spit at 30 years ago seems distasteful. I say, if someone's good at what they do, and they enjoy what they're doing, punch away.</p></div>"|1053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1053-flat-pack-philosophy/|7.2|David Raposa

Google tells me that the Parkteatret in Oslo, Norway is a classy venue, but this could be the front of any kind of room anywhere-- there's nothing distinctive about it. The four members settle down at their instruments, trumpeter Arve Henriksen sitting square in the middle while Helge Sten and Ståle Storløkken flank him on each side; Jarle Vespestad's drumkit sits elevated at the back. This is Supersilent's live setup, and we're seeing it for the first time on DVD, entirely in black and white.</p><p>
    Then the lights dim, and the space is transformed. As the first piece opens, Henriksen sits bathed in shadow; in some frames we see nothing but his right ear and the glint off his trumpet. Storløkken's shots backlight him dramatically while he coaxes piercing tones from his keyboard, and though Sten also goes by the name Deathprod, he's the least ominous of the four, hunching under a spotlight as he manipulates effects and plays low notes on a knee-high keyboard. By the time Vespestad gets real camera time, his eyes are closed and he's leaning calmly into a barrage of jittery beats and analog ticks like appliances switching on and off-- which the film matches with double images, abstract and out-of-focus shots, and other cinematic devices.</p><p>
<em>7</em> captures a single, complete concert from August 2004, and finds more structure than their previous concert album, <em>5</em>. Each piece runs from 10 minutes to half an hour, and the band usually starts with one member playing alone, before the rest of the group joins or withdraws from the improvisation until it builds to torrents of beats and rhythms like carpet tacks thrown into a windstorm. The process is even more engrossing on film, where we can watch them discover the lulls and explosions of ""7.3"", or hesitate, play, and then fall silent during the encore. </p><p>
    While their music remains non-idiomatic, Storløkken hits several 1970s reference points, adding the King Crimson-esque mellotron that opens ""7.3"", or harshly analog tones like something out of ""Doctor Who and the Silurians"".  At the peak of ""7.1"", he even breaks out a vamp-- Supersilent's only funky moment on record. But Henriksen is even more surprising. An awesomely gentle soul by the sound of his playing, he constructs solos out of the slightest breath sounds, or sings in a powerfully frail falsetto. And yet on stage, he's never precious, beaming big smiles to the audience and the band. He's also singing more nowadays, and at the end of ""7.2"" he grabs the mic and belts some made-up tune, landing somewhere between a punk and a soul singer. </p><p>
    The cinematography and lighting define the experience with a heavy hand. (All three cameramen, including Rune Grammofon's house artist Kim Hiorthøy, and both lighting engineers get credits on a sleeve that doesn't even list the members of the band.) The stark b&amp;w; footage turns the simple stage into a boundless empty space or a UFO landing, then pens it in, evoking a primitive, flame-licked cavern. Sometimes the gimmicks make it feel like a kooky art-school project; nonetheless, it's one of the most engrossing and well-conceived concert films of the past few years. The strobe lights, the distortions, and the occasional blinding swell of light that engulfs the band from behind, all complement the music; they illustrate its ambiguity, and its endless, shadowy corners.</p></div>"|7632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7632-7/|8.3|Chris Dahlen

    to proto-micro to acid revival. But Pitchfork readers without deep crates probably know him best as the creator of 
    two of the most inescapable techno anthems of the past two years: ""Gehts 
    Noch?"" (under his own name) and ""Rocker"" (as one half of Alter Ego). These two riff 
    wraiths would do Angus Young and DJ Pierre equally proud.</p><p>
    There's very little anthemic about <i>Superstructure, however, and even 
    less that's rockin'. Instead, Flügel's collaboration with vibraphonist Christopher Dell turns the concept of ""jazzy techno"" on its head. Fading in on some 
    liquid synth pads and gently brushed, twitchy hi-hats reminiscent of the 
    straighter Farben tracks, the opening title track is quickly upended by a 
    fountain of vibes from Dell. Flügel's beat constructions tease and hint at 
    traditionally club friendly sounds like house and techno and even a kind of 
    lopsided hip-hop without actually coming out and stating them, as Dell 
    sprinkles runs of vibes like Pollock tossing pigment. ""Habitation"" recalls 
    the starved drum &amp; bass Flügel has made under the Eight Miles High alias, 
    while ""Miniaturisation"" provides what you'd expect, an almost microtonal 
    duet for drums and vibes that barely resolves into anything as coarse as a 
    groove. ""4 Door Body Cell"" hews closer to traditional techno, but it's 
    traditionalism pales compared to the more outre experiments, whether they 
    congeal or not. (They usually do.) </i></p><p>
    Dell is a classically trained vibist whose insistence on repetition has put 
    him at odds with ""free"" jazz orthodoxy even as it puts him in close 
    proximity to techno. And at its best <i>Superstructure has a hands on, 
    jammed feeling that rubs with productive friction against the rigidity of 
    drum machines. </i><i>Superstructure is a dark but not oppressive album; the 
    cover, featuring thin white line schematics over a solid black background 
    captures the feeling as much as anything. Dell and Flügel have made an album 
    that recognizes jazz as an engine for improvisation rather than organ or 
    piano samples to be draped over a 4/4 beat. At times it reminds you of 
    everything from the crooked spines of Eric Dolphy's </i><i>Out to Lunch to 
    the astro-black portamento funk of Herbie Hancock's Mwandishi band. There's 
    no randomization function that can make an album like this. </i></p></div>"|2639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2639-superstructure/|7.8|Jess Harvell

And yet good god does it still sound so <i>teenaged</i>: They're in their fifties, but they come at their music like two guys with a long, firm grounding in sharing the same bedrooms, watching the same cartoons, and fighting over the same last pork chops. You just know that if they'd gone off young to work with other people, they'd have had all their best qualities stripped off of them; you just know what ""other people"" are like. ""No, this band will <i>not</i> play a song about pineapples or a sing about tits. No, this band will <i>not</i> let you sing like a variety show Freddie Mercury, even if you got there first. No, this band will <i>definitely</i> not let you look like Mr. Rogers with a Hitler mustache.""</p><p>
    
    Together, though-- for years and years-- they get to cooperate in the execution of what's inevitably a suburban-adolescent comic-book fantasy: turning themselves into plasticized Mickey Mouse maestros, the class clowns and mischief-makers at the music conservatory. The title of their last album: <i>Little Beethoven</i>, undoubtedly a scamp. That adolescence runs right into the lyrics on this one, matching up with the older-guy prerogative to not take things so damned seriously. Young lovers do post-breakup aimlessness: ""The sun comes up, the sun goes down/ And all I do is dick around."" (Then the song breaks out into fake-metal Slayer.) More experienced lovers prefer to woman who wears no perfume, because: ""The olfactory sense is the sense that most strongly evokes memories of the past/ Well, screw the past."" And older, wiser lovers have good advice for the young ones, including the best thing I've heard in song this year: ""Chicks chicks dig dig D-I-G dig dig METAPHORS."" (""Use them wisely, use them well/ And you will never know the hell/ Of loneliness."")</p><p>
    
    There's that same Mickey Mouse teendom in the music, too, which folds tricks from across a long career into one package-- including contributions from some longtime Sparks collaborators. It's largely drumless and ""orchestral,"" which is to say that it pops along on staccato strings and runs through lots of flouncing arrangements; the sound has the airtight feel of a software symphony. Other songs dance along on keyboards, sequencers, and fussy guitars, making little minuets, romping happily around the notions of corniness and camp. Real-world product testing reveals that it's a little bothersome on headphones in the subway (just makes you tense) and terrific on speakers during at-home downtime (perfect for laundry-folding). Something teenaged about that, too-- the way they're better when you're bored.</p><p>
    
    The one teenaged thing they're missing, unfortunately, is an adolescent attention span, the kind that flogs an idea for two minutes and then moves on to something else. These songs go on too long, even to the point of faking fade-outs and then bursting back for another coda. They drag and repeat themselves and wander and occasionally come off a little all the same. They're adorable-- just probably not as strong as anyone on this side of the speakers would like. Mickey Mouse maestros have a bit of the mickeymouse this time-- but the trick's still a good one, and bless them for keeping it going.</p></div>"|7848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7848-hello-young-lovers/|6.9|Nitsuh Abebe

Mark Lanegan fronted grunge almost-weres Screaming Trees, one of those odd bands that everyone knows but few listen to, and he did a stint in Queens of the Stone Age. Given Belle and Sebastian's penchant for lacy chamber pop and the Screaming Trees/QOTSA bias toward angrily trippy stoner jams, it only makes sense that Campbell's and Lanegan's collaboration produced a bunch of mildly acerbic sea shanties and maudlin dust-bowl folk ballads.</p><p>
    ""Deus Ibi Est"" establishes <em>Ballad of the Broken Seas</em>'s <em>mise en scène</em>-- a broad, desolate expanse of metronomic kickdrum and lilting acoustic guitar.  Lanegan slips into a Grinchy beatnik drawl, doing Tom Waits doing Leonard Cohen, sharpishly channeling the voice of an itinerant soldier, while Campbell's airy Latin hook (the dead language kind, not the Ricky Martin kind) sounds as if all the Whos down in Whoville wandered into a seedy wharf bar.</p><p>
    If you really wanna cut the roast beast, let's say it plain: While Campbell's contributions to the album are far from negligible, the thing reeks of Lanegan, aligning itself with the hard-bitten American roots music of his solo albums. Lanegan's boozy, melancholic growl and down-and-out imagery on ""The Circus Is Leaving Town"" would fit comfortably on a Crooked Fingers record, that pacesetter for all things indie-gone-Americana. He turns in an appropriately smoldering cover of Hank Williams's ""Ramblin' Man"", Campbell's whispered taunts and supplications skewing its narrative POV. Even openly sentimental songs like the hushed, piano-driven title track acquire a thin layer of grit: ""We fucked up the sun to kingdom come/ You were under my blood and my skin."" Campbell's presence seems unavoidably minimized on the duets, as her gusty chirp flutters through the holes in Lanegan's decaying clapboard shack of a voice, yet it's also indispensable, like the color commentary on a televised golf match. </p><p>
    Some of the record's most penetrating moments arrive when either Lanegan or Campbell take center stage alone.  Lanegan's ""(Do You Wanna) Come Walk With Me?"", despite moments of implied, discomforting pederasty (""Little girl, have I told you how you light up my life?/ Come and lay down beside me, come and thrill me tonight""), features the inarguably vivid and arresting lyrical turn, ""There's a crimson bird flying when I go down on you.""  Campbell takes the lead on ""Black Mountain"" and ""Saturday's Gone"", her voice cascading over quivering strings and swirling arpeggios on the former, and riding in on clip-clopping hooves on the latter.  The thirty-odd years of musical experience Campbell and Lanegan collectively possess are worn like sun-creased skin on <em>Ballad of the Broken Seas</em>, which manages to be consistently engaging and sufficiently memorable without making too much fuss about it. </p></div>"|1747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1747-ballad-of-the-broken-seas/|7.2|Brian Howe

I never belonged to a singles club, or bought a record based purely on the logo on the spine, but I vaguely recall noticing somewhere in the mid-90s that Matador's ""all wrongs reversed"" slogan kept turning up on my discs, and that Merge, SST, and Sub Pop had a certain cachet that went beyond inventory lists. But then, the internet happened, and labels are now threatened to become as marginalized as cover art, liner notes, and those goddamn sticky binders that prevent me from quickly cracking into CDs.</p><p>
    All of which makes the label comp a dinosaur-by-association, an all-star sampler of an outfit's roster in an age where music is often taken á la carte. Still, for a new label trying to craft a distinct identity, this kind of manifesto might not be a futile maneuver-- even if it will inevitably be stripped for parts as soon as it hits the file-sharing bazaars. It's the old bait-and-switch: Hook the listeners in with your big acts, and then deposit a bunch of the no-names in their memory banks before they know what hit 'em.</p><p>
    2006 finds Memphis Industries in a perfect position to execute this trick play, having blessed us with the chimera sounds of the Go! Team and locked up British distribution for Swedish psych faves Dungen.  Two tracks from each are the headliners here; nothing we haven't heard before, but ""Friendship Update"" and ""Ta Det Lungt"" still have yet to wear out. As banner holders for Memphis Industries, however, the two bands don't have much of a sound in common, and thus don't suggest any obvious hints about the label's master plan.</p><p>
    The answer to the riddle is that there is no answer, at least not in any sense more satisfying than declaring that the artists of indie label Memphis Industries sound exactly as amorphous and vague as the term ""indie"" has become in 2006.  The bands that are given the biggest push here, with the two-track treatment, fan out over the breadth of the indiescape: Field Music's Shins-popping, Absentee's Edwyn-Collins-fronts-the-Strokes fantasy, Blue States clinging to the Great
    Post-Rock Hope.</p><p>
    Maybe I just prefer a tease, but the one-shot artists on the compilation stand out in the CMJ-median crowd.  The Squire of Somerton may read like someone <i>really into renaissance fairs, but his song ""The Band"" works as a refreshingly bizarre piece of chamber-pop.  The Pipettes, meanwhile, have the bandname deadest on capturing my scientist heart, and their effortless neo-girl-group sound seals the deal.</i></p><p>
    In fact, there's nary a sour track on the compilation, with no worse crime than unoriginality ever perpetrated.  But with such far-flung diversity, the collection also fails to accomplish the goal of making Memphis Industries a brand with meaning, deepening their profile beyond its keywords: ""British"" and ""independent.""  Sure, 12 bands in the vein of the Go! Team would probably produce a much less consistent offering, but if nothing else, it would represent a cohesive mission statement worthy of the kind of unflinching loyalty record geeks once gloried in.  As it is, <em>The Memphis Family Album</em> is ultimately as faceless as its name, leaving the label without a personality to cut through the digital anonymity.</p></div>"|2116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2116-the-memphis-family-album-music-from-memphis-industries-vol-2/|7.4|Rob Mitchum

Past tense is critical here because the     moment in which Coldcut were feted feels like a hundred million years ago     now. Concepts like trip-hop, turntablism, etc., aren't quite past tense     enough to stir warm feelings of nostalgia. They're ""what the fuck were we     thinking?"" ideas in 2006, and no one wants to listen to records that give     them the feeling of looking at old photos of themselves with bad haircuts     and stupid clothes. Sure, no genre is completely devoid of good ideas-- or     even, more importantly, good records-- but there's a landfill full of     ""abstract beats"" out there that no one's stepped up to reclaim. If you want     a real laugh, read the second half of the <i>Rough Guide to Drum and Bass     devoted to big beat/downtempo. What the fuck </i><i>were we thinking?</i></p>
<p>So, while, yes, better than the bulk of their Ninja Tune-affiliated peers,     Coldcut were not as good as we once believed. That Eric B and Rakim remix that Eric B and     Rakim hated-- it's really not that great, is it? I'd rather listen to ""Pump Up     the Volume"" than ""Beats and Pieces"" for my kitschy sampladelic single fix. And while concepts like multimedia and chopping up the history of recorded music seemed like not just a good idea at the     time but the very future itself, information overload isn't an exciting     concept in 2006, it just is. (Plus their <i>Journeys by DJ</i> record is the     most overrated DJ mix of all time.) So credit them for getting there first,     but don't flog pioneer status to tell me why I should listen to the records.</p>
<p><i>Sound Mirrors</i> isn't a cut-and-paste DJ record per se, but it's     constructed in the same way. Instead of slamming chunks of disparate records     together via sampler or turntable, they wrangle a few albums' worth of guest     stars and hop from genre to genre like Q*Bert. (The video game sprite, not     the Skratch Pikl. At least I think so.) ""Walk a Mile"" tries on the     shimmering fabric of smooth, gauzy deep house, complete with vocals from the     original voice of post-coital, outerspace ennui, Robert Owens. Saul Williams     hectors ""Mr. Nichols"" from an era where we thought poetry slams and poetry     slams on rap records were a good idea, and ""This Island Earth"" reminds you     just how hard people worked the thin concept of a female singer over a     mid-tempo rap beat in the late-90s. If you've ever wanted to hear Jon     Spencer and Mike Ladd on the same track, <i>Sound Mirrors</i> is for you, and     the pairing, or even just the concept of the pairing, will tell you whether     or not you need to hear it. Coldcut acquit themselves well, in the sense     that they pull off all of their various generic sleights of hand. But, as     per usual, whatever off-hand virtuosity <i>Sound Mirrors</i> displays,     there's no center here. No one likes a show-off.</p></div>"|1537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1537-sound-mirrors/|6.5|Jess Harvell

So when Sufjan Stevens pens a song as compassionate as ""John Wayne Gacy, Jr."", he's hardly promoting clown-costumed serial murder. Instead, he's acknowledging that life isn't as black and white as the majority of Christian music would have you believe.</p><p>
    You'd think a little of that emotional depth would have rubbed off on John Ringhoefer, aka Half-Handed Cloud, when he served as trombonist in Stevens' touring band, the Illinoisemakers. But on <em>Halos &amp; Lassos</em>, Half-Handed Cloud's fourth full-length, Ringhoefer continues his relentlessly upbeat exploration of his Christian faith with all the willful naiveté of a Sunday School lesson planner. It's hard not to roll your eyes at cutesy declarations like, ""The world is still the Lord's/ The devil's just a squatter"" or the nursery rhyme directness of ""You get all the credit and you get all the praise/ Got us out of messes and pulled us out of graves."" But, to be fair, Ringhoefer's songs are teeming with enough biblical allusion and tongue-in-cheek theology to elevate it above 99% of Christian music.</p><p>
    Like past Half-Handed Cloud albums, Ringhoefer doesn't skimp on sugary pop, but <em>Halos &amp; Lassos</em> strays from his formula with the addition of the Omnichord, a vintage synthesizer that spits out a canned rhythm section, video game soundtrack keys and a gurgling water effect. It's a novelty that tires very quickly. But still, out of the Omnichord's thrift store lo-fi, each song blossoms with the integration of an organic instrumental palate. Beautiful passages of piano, banjo, marimba, and bells erupt out of the monochrome of ersatz drums and sustained eight-bit tones. On the album's longest track, ""You've Been Faithful to Us Clouds"", the song bobs along to a synth arpeggio before abruptly transitioning into a saccharine multi-part harmony. And as sparse live drums punctuate Ringhoefer's oohs, the vibrancy of a live performance rescues the song from languishing in demo hell. </p><p>
    Half-Handed Cloud's real draw, though, is his peculiar, ADHD take on pop music. With 19 songs clocking in at just shy of a half-hour, the album's spitfire sequencing speeds by, making you feel like the Ramones wrote some really epic songs. It's a quirk that's both frustrating and enticing: There's no chance of digesting these songs on the first, second, or even third pass, but the blink-and-you'll-miss-it nature of it all leaves a listener hungry to make sense of such a confounding blur. If you're blessed with the patience to unpack such a dense record, <em>Halos &amp; Lassos</em> has enough compelling melody to help you forgive that ubiquitous Omnichord and some truly cloying lyrics. And, surely, that's something worthy of our praise.</p></div>"|3716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3716-halos-lassos/|7.0|John Motley

Casiotone-man Owen Ashworth sounds like he's trying to provide a soundtrack to that sentiment. The tired plonking of big fingers on little keyboards, the resigned lo-fi mumbling, the slacker-bedroom tale telling-- they're tired, morose, frustrated, sick of waiting. You'd think the schtick would get old, but it hasn't; it may be too primal, too basic. Every one of us, after all, has written ""songs"" like these, even if they're as simple as tapping a rolled-up waiting-room magazine on your leg and grumbling, ""My appointment was for two o'clock/ Why is my dentist such a cock?"" They're the songs you sing to yourself when you have problems too banal to expect anyone else to care about-- which is the college grad's mid-twenties in a nutshell. I've seen Ashworth perform twice, once in a big venue and once in a dorm lobby; the first seemed awkward, the second natural. He's big, sloppy, dry in his humor: It seemed like some freshman shut-in had dragged his gear into the hallway to bother everyone.</p><p>
    
    The brief (30-minute) <i>Etiquette</i> is a step forward for him, musically-- it complicates things, cleans them up, brings in contributions from his friends, and even conjures up some Postal Service sheen. But the crux of it is still the storytelling. A lot of Ashworth's songs are two minutes and two verses long: Act One and Act Two of some tale or other about middle-class 20-something kids doing cruddy everyday middle-class 20-something stuff. It's to his credit that he's not looking to romanticize that stuff. Most of his time is spent doing the opposite: cutting back to the plainness of reality, the <i>lack</i> of romance. ""New Year's Kiss"" starts with someone trudging home hung over, which is exactly how Ashworth and even his drum machine sound. An afternoon spent reconstructing the night reveals a kiss more boring than hoped-- not ""on a balcony with champagne lips/ But in a pantry against some pancake mix."" The song ends without further comment.</p><p>
    
    ""I Love Creedence"" is even more banal and even more affecting. Childhood friends move to Philadelphia to live on family money. One meets a guy and moves out. The lonely remaining kid gets a job like everyone else. If not quite indie-scene haiku, there's at least the smell of Carver and Fred Barthelme and ""K-Mart Realism"" here-- the everyday snapshot and the relentless leaving-it-at-that, the implication (but never the evidence) that it all really <i>matters</i>, man. Why it seems to matter: because something just as normal happened to you, and it certainly <i>felt</i> important, even if you were no closer than Ashworth to figuring out what it meant. ""What it meant"" is the third verse, the one Casiotone songs omit.</p><p>
    
    All of which is pretty typical indie-- this desire to talk just like everyone else around you, and make music like you don't necessarily know any more about your instrument than they do. There's some of that latter impulse still present, in the way the one-note trudge of ""New Year's Kiss"" is lifted from Pavement's ""Here"", or the way the next track sounds like bedroom synth-poppers Vitesse, who sound like one-time bedroom synth-poppers Magnetic Fields. In other words, this isn't invention; it's a style. The style says rickety bedroom Casio is as ""real"" as it gets, even if it's second-general passed-down real, every bit as stylized as hip-hop's occasional crack-era nostalgia. (Of course, the crack era's waned, whereas the world of bored, lonely college grads holds steady.) More credit to Ashworth, then, for stretching his musical wings here. Around the usual minimal plonks and the usual overdriven fuzz-bombs, there are live instruments, guest vocalists, and songs like ""Nashville Parthenon""-- the track is detailed and modern like a Figurine number, and a thrill when pedal steel comes cruising in unexpectedly.</p><p>
    
    The improvements raise questions, though. Ashworth has set himself up to talk to people who are (presumably) just like him-- describing love and friendship as played out in crappy apartments, both for the people who live in them and the college kids soon to join. But is that it? Can he talk to anyone else? Couldn't he make something even less rickety, something pitch-perfect enough to tell those stories more widely-- just as Morrissey, one of his models, once did? For now, he sounds in between: <em>Etiquette</em> gives up the homemade purity of Casiotone's first few records, but it hasn't entirely gotten where it's going, either.</p></div>"|1338.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1338-etiquette/|7.7|Nitsuh Abebe

    Eric Copeland are roommates, it's little surprise that the Brooklyn pair
    end up collaborating between their chief commitments and
    touring schedules. As Terrestrial Tones, the duo generate the kind of prickly,
    experimental soundscapes that you might expect from such a meeting of creative
    minds. There's more evidence of Black Dice's rickety, shorn racket than
    Animal Collective's pastoral improv however, and after getting feisty with the
    contact mics, Tare and Copeland are left with an effervescent thicket of
    electronic bleating and arbitrary sound effects. Over this, they add layers of indecipherable, barbed lyrics that sound as though they're sung from
    an underground lair soaked in blood and brambles. This can be challenging at
    times-- for example, when the music loses momentum and drifts into an
    abyss of white noise. For the most part though, the seemingly endless boundaries
    and subtly propulsive rhythms draw the listener into an engaging world of
    manipulated samples and shimmering loops.</p><p>
<em>Dead Drunk</em> was recorded while Copeland and Portner were living in Paris last summer.
    Just how much their environment affected the output is unclear. Unlike
    CocoRosie's <em>La Maison De Mon Reve, which the Brooklyn sisters also recorded
    while living together in Paris, </em><em>Dead Drunk</em> doesn't exactly conjure up images
    of winding streets and champagne sunsets over the Sacre Coeur. It's more
    reflective of the hyperactive grit of the weekly flea markets, where the pair
    apparently spent a lot of time prowling through the maze of discarded records,
    dismantled Soviet era electronic equipment and junkyard bits and bobs.</p><p>
    
    This third album is much more concise as a whole than the group's 40 minute
    ""single,"" <em>Oboroed / Circus Lives</em>. Some of Terrestrial Tones' previous
    output has sounded like little more than two mates smoking a few joints at home
    and playing around with their computers, and is only likely to appeal to either
    serious fans of noise music, or Copeland and Portner's other bands. <em>Dead Drunk</em>
    stands its ground as a more interesting compositional entity. The tracks entwine
    and inform each other-- malleable rhythms budge, contract and twist in a way
    that ties each track to the next in unexpected ways. The flow between second

Black Star and the Roots and Common and Dead Prez are captivating 
    artists, for sure. But in some ways, I grew out of them. The world of hip-hop 
    extends further than Okayplayer, Rawkus, and creaky neo-soul, despite the 
    inviting bubble they create. The man often anointed World's Funniest Dude 
    evidently doesn't see things this way: When Chappelle threw his dream 
    concert one Brooklyn afternoon in 2004, he chose these artists, as well as 
    Kanye West. Two years on, Chappelle released the results as a concert film-- 
    his own personal <em>Wattstax</em>.</p><p>
    
    This soundtrack compiles <em>some</em> of the live music found therein.  Label politics kept the most thrilling stuff on the shelf, which means the film's gooey yet uplifting feeling is emulated here to much weaker effect.  On screen, director Michel Gondry's jumbled narrative expertly raises dramatic tension with certain performances, then rips back to Chappelle, who we see joyously organizing his show and riffing on everything in sight.  Similarly, each track on this album is broken up by bits from an epic conference call between all of the artists that performed, recorded at some point before the show.  Initially, it seems like a wonderful, revealing idea: These guys are all good friends and have no problem clowning each other (especially Mos Def).  But 10 or 20 listens later, I'm no longer amused by stic.man referring to himself as ""stickie-ickie-ickie,"" or Jill Scott bitching to ?uestlove, the show's musical director, about refusing to play anything off her first album.</p><p>
    
    ?uesto (aka Ahmir Thompson) has long overseen the entire Okayplayer/Rawkus axis, holding himself responsible for getting folks together to record, and often exec producing albums.  It's admirable work he does, shepherding so many big personalities. Unfortunately, his mix on this extraordinarily rare live hip-hop album is average at best.  Sometimes the vocals are pushed way up, sometimes down.  There are going to be glitches at any show, but all the feedback on a slow burner like ""Umi Says"" is downright distracting, especially when Mos Def is singing <i>that</i> beautifully.  Alternately, the ever-magnetic Erykah Badu's ""Back in the Day"" is so scat-filled and loose it needs a hair net.  Talib Kweli, bothered by a sore throat, actually sounds kinda hard on ""Definition"" and ""The Blast"".  I guess all this time it wasn't the overstuffed verses and tangled syntax weighing him down; he just needed to sound more like Juvenile.  Elsewhere, Dead Prez give up a chunky, rock-ish version of their stand-by ""Hip-Hop"", in which stic.man's a cappella verse exists in an odd zone between histrionic bullshit and outstandingly inspired.</p><p>
    
    There are a few gripping musical moments in the film that fail to appear here-- particularly a Dayton-based college marching band's snappy rendition of West's ""Jesus Walks"", as well as a pretty dope version (!) of Wyclef Jean's ""If I Was President"" recorded in some shack in front of said marching band.  The biggest omission, however, is the awe-inspiring version of ""Killing Me Softly"" that the still-luminous Lauryn Hill churns out near the film's end.  I don't know that there's anything that can be said about Lauryn that hasn't been already, and personally, I thought I never wanted to hear that Fugees song again.  Turns out I was wrong; it's soul-shaking, glassy-eyed stuff and it's not here.  Chappelle's incredible, faux-James Brown gags are sadly absent, too: They'd have made far stronger interludes.</p><p>
    
    There was a crystallized period where love, swagger, and uncompromising musicianship were <i>de rigueur</i> for outer-circle hip-hop.  These days, Mos is a film star, Dead Prez are more riling than righteous, and Badu's been missing in action since 2003's <i>Worldwide Underground</i>.  Common and the Roots have aged better, but while their music remains ever thoughtful, their messages lean too flowery.  Still, it's nice that every once in a while, dudes like Chappelle will wrangle them up and say, ""What about this shit, America?!""  Just next time make sure you get the Fugees cleared.</p></div>"|7899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7899-dave-chappelles-block-party-ost/|7.1|Sean Fennessey

<p><i>The Bedside Drama:</i> serves as a more obvious and awkward midpoint  between the immediate likeability of early Of Montreal and the manic  complexity of their later records. <i>The Bedside Drama</i>, with its more  thematic lyrics and reoccurring characters, is the most  ambitious of these releases.

    group of songs. The addition of drummer Shelley Harrison, however, helps to make <em>Would I Find Your Psychic  
    Guideline</em> more engaging. The six  
    songs on this 12""-only release are hypnotic, cyclical affairs,  
    relying on dense, fuzzy organ drones and simple, driving drumbeats. The arrangements are often simple-- typically featuring no more than two or three parts-- but the results are  
    far from boring or generic.</p><p>
    
    Organ and drums are the most  
    prominent instruments utilized here-- although keyboard flourishes,  
    strings, and guitars find their way in as well. Deer's pure, clean vocals are the perfect counter to the eerie,  
    robotic sonics, but they're only featured on about half of the songs.  
    As a result they become part of the mix in a  
    unique way-- not by demanding your attention, despite their clarity, but by snaking their way through the tracks.</p><p>
    
    ""Dowser Hunters"", the first instrumental in the every-other-song  
    pattern of instrumental-to-vocal tracks, is like a dreamy circus  
    theme, with a bouncy rhythm and low-mixed drums that combine to make it seem both  
    jovial and creepy all at once. Unfortunately, it's difficult to identify  
    the songs by their titles, as there seem to be six tracks, yet the  
    tracklisting only includes five titles. Which of these six is the  
    untitled one is a mystery. However, title or no, track five-- with  
    ethereal swirling keyboard tones and quiet banjo plucking-- is the  
    stronger of the record's other two instrumentals. The song  
    lacks percussion, so the bass and keys wander without aim in a  
    dizzying fashion. </p><p>
    
    The album's brevity and vinyl-only release are its two biggest  
    problems. Even though the hand-printed cover is nice (albeit fairly  
    plain), I can't help but wonder if a CD release would fare better.  
    The six songs on this EP top out at just over 20 minutes, meaning  
    just as you're getting into the mesmerizing rhythm, it's over. Deer  
    brought the layers and excess of <em>A Sea as a Shore</em> down to the  
    basics, but now I find myself longing for more each time I listen. </p></div>"|4036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4036-would-i-find-your-psychic-guideline/|7.3|Cory D. Byrom

    character and a vision of techno that's as bloodyminded as anyone's. At some 
    point in the 1990s, Meldgaard must have had his wig seriously pulled back by 
    the wriggling, static-ridden, techno-as-lifeform that came out of the Basic 
    Channel camp. Since roughly the beginning of the decade/century/millennium, 
    he's been panning for gold in the silty stream of post-BC dub 
    techno; his releases on his own label Echocord, Kompakt, and others have 
    delighted at the subtle variations in texture of rustling noise over deep 
    basslines and functional beats. If anyone wanted to remake <i>Woman of the 
    Dunes, Meldgaard's slowly shifting grainscapes would be the perfect 
    soundtrack to being buried alive in a sandlot.</i></p><p>
    
    So as you might expect, <i>Victimizer doesn't deviate broadly from his 
    comfort zone; it could only be further from 2006's disco baubles and 
    hygienic neo-trance if he actually started sending his singles into the 
    world smeared with peat and moss. Like the furthest reaches of 
    what-we-used-to-call-microhouse-but-doesn't-really-have-a-name-now-- Jan 
    Jelinek's Farben productions, the recent work of Ricardo 
    Villalobos-- Meldgaard's music is ""dance"" because there are beats buried 
    under the textural slurry. But unlike the crunching, bristling rhythms of 
    Basic Channel or even the oomph of Chain Reaction, Meldgaard's beats are too 
    limp to push anyone around a dancefloor. You can rock back and forth to it. 
    Maybe.</i></p><p>
    
    But <i>Victimizer differs just enough from the earlier </i><i>Close 
    Selections to justify its existence. Most notably, there are the peals of guitar that 
    swell and sag like deflating balloons, the instrumental aftertaste of a goth 
    record that's been abstracted to a handful of gestures. Vocals are dubbed 
    until all that's left is the residue around the rim, a free floating vapor, 
    or a low-res moan heard creepily through apartment walls. The bass continues 
    to provide the barest possible forward momentum. But more than anything, 
    Meldgaard is interested in bitmapping the mix until it nearly dissolves. 
    It's no surprise that he has a history of playing in shoegaze bands before 
    discovering techno, but his work as Mikkel Metal is hairy, shaggy, and dirty 
    in a way that the candied guitars of shoegaze rarely were. If Swamp Thing 
    got down, </i><i>Victimizer would be his soundtrack.</i></p></div>"|5634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5634-victimizer/|7.1|Jess Harvell

    hooks. It was being good at it, in the actual putting-records-in-the-charts
    sense. Arguably the Ramones got there first and certainly had a more lasting
    impact on whatever we think of as pop-punk (or punk-pop depending on
    your feelings on modifiers). But Blondie were also never going to inspire
    someone like avant composer Rhys Chatham to start a punk guitar trio as an
    adjunct to his explorations in post-academic minimalism. The Ramones were as
    much a conceptual art project with pudding bowl haircuts as a pop band.</p><p>
    
    It certainly didn't hurt that Blondie had one of the most appealing
    frontwomen of the late 20th-century-- who looks positive H-O-T on the cover
    of <i>Sound and Vision, the latest repackaging of their greatest hits,
    despite (because of?) wearing just a pillow case and red electrical tape.
    Whereas the Ramones had four praying mantis in girl's Jordache. And while
    the Ramones were positively vicious in their devotion to pre-hippie rock
    (recording with Phil Spector, for one) and transforming the starchy
    blandness of '70s suburbia into a positive aesthetic, Blondie embraced what
    we now know as The Future-- disco, hip-hop, reggae-- while helping to invent
    new wave. (Your feelings on that one may vary).</i></p><p>
    
    It's hard to imagine a time now when that seemed heretical, probably because
    it's hard to remember a time now when Blondie was a punk band with a capital
    P, trading dirty looks with Legs McNeil and waiting backstage with Richard
    Hell. All of these songs, most especially the big hits, have become part of
    the shared classic rock heritage of anyone born after 1970. They belong to
    the Two-Fer Tuesdays and budget priced '80s comps now. And it's hard to
    imagine the members of Blondie-- don't forget, ""Blondie is a Band""-- seeing
    this as anything less than a total good. Through sheer willpower they
    achieved their goal: to become one of the great pop bands of all time.</p><p>
    
    So why buy another reiteration of songs everyone knows? Well, if you don't
    already own a Blondie best-of for one thing. I've had a copy of <i>The Best
    of Blondie since I was about 8, but those Fisher Price record player
    needles were hell on vinyl, so I'm happy to have </i><i>Sound and Vision in
    lieu of looting through Goodwill bins. (</i><i>The Best of Blondie is still
    available on CD, of course, and that's an A+++/five star/10.0 record. So
    take that for what it's worth.)  Everyone knows the songs, but I'll give
    special shouts to: ""Hanging on the Telephone"" (gender flip-flop new wave
    frustration); ""One Way or Another"" (the Pretenders in situ, with added
    sass); ""Heart of Glass"" (Abba for the legwarmers generation); ""Atomic"" (the
    single having the best record sleeve ever); ""Dreaming"" (buzz-saw bubblegum
    with caveman drums); ""The Tide Is High"" (proto-Gwen Stefani cod-reggae);
    ""Rapture"" (the first time I ever heard of anything called ""rap"" though I
    wouldn't have known it from Adam).</i></p><p>
    
    Marks against: it contains neither ""X Offender"" or ""(I'm Always Touched by
    Your) Presence, Dear"", both of which are on the European version. (Not
    really a reason to book that ticket for Berlin but there was certainly room
    on the CD.) It also contains a few au courant (if this was 2001)
    electro-flavored remixes in favor of the originals that need to get gone
    yesterday. It ends with a goofy mash-up of ""Rapture"" with the vocals from
    ""Riders on the Storm"", which is fun the first time, but the compilers made
    the right decision sticking it where they did.</p><p>
    
    The other reason to buy is that <i>Sound and Vision comes with a DVD of
    all of Blondie's videos, which, yes, may seem like a cynical grab at your
    wallet, especially if you already forked out for another compilation or the
    album re-masters that came out in 2001. With the advent of VH1 Classic-- and
    stand alone DVD collections-- owning your own copy of ""Heart of Glass"" might
    not seem so cool as when we were all fussing with VHS doorstops but you'll
    want it if you get off on the cheap charms of early music video. Plus
    there's the always luminous Deborah Harry, who could give boiling asparagus
    an erotic charge, all while looking too bored to live.</i></p></div>"|1198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1198-greatest-hits-sound-and-vision/|8.0|Jess Harvell

""Just hiding      somewhere being quietly genius?"" Well, yes and no. Craig's output hasn't      quite been as nonstop as his 1990s run of albums and singles, but he's still      on the grind. He recently overhauled 1995's classic <i>Landcruising</i>-- now      known as, well, <i>The Album Formerly Known As...</i> since the original is      tied up in contractual disputes-- as a limited edition, vinyl import that's      surprisingly one of the few you-didn't-ask-for-it-but-here-it-is      re-recordings that improves upon the original. He released the great,      grinding tech-house single ""Sandstorm"", sounding just like its title. And      he's produced highly feted remixes for Delia and Gavin and Theo      Parrish, although in both cases I can't quite hear what the fuss is about.</p>
<p>And he also released this Fabric mix. Standing just to the right of contemporary      dancefloor trends, <i>Fabric 25</i> is mostly house music you thought they      didn't make anymore, almost shockingly basic and rhythmically direct,      focused on the push-push-push-in-the-bush of a swishing or pounding 4/4      groove. Though Craig cheekily opens with the Ying Yang Twins' ""Wait""-- plus      some very Craigian atmospheric techno pads, turning it into the filthiest      Basic Channel track you've ever heard-- there are no other curveballs. Tracks      like Kenny Larkin's ""Good God"" and D'Malicious' ""Alive"" are transfusions of      the gospel and soul blood that has been leeched out of house and techno in      the 21st-century, and titles like ""Africanism"" tell you all you need to know.      This is a mix made by someone who still hears house and techno as an      extension of black popular music, something played during drive-time radio.      (Right down to the bizarre ad-libs Craig drops on the mic throughout,      somewhere between DJ Assault and DJ Kayslay.) While not quite screaming diva      house, and though Craig's own ""Darkness"" sounds very much like a childhood      spent listening to Kraftwerk, this isn't one for fans of Germanic eyewear.</p>
<p>Global Communication aren't quite in Craig's league as either producers or      DJs, but they similarly stand outside whatever's going on in the Month in      Techno column. Best known for the gauzy, gorgeous ""Ob-Selon Mi-Nos"", aka the      more baldly titled ""14:31""-- a tick-tock ambient techno track that GlobCom's      Tom Middleton crafted as a requiem for his grandfather-- the pair has genre      hopped from hard techno to drum &amp; bass to downtempo and back again.      Middleton is an especially enjoyable eclectic DJ-- the e-word usually being a      sign of jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none-- who will slam handbag house Missy      Elliott remixes into Bollywood drum &amp; bass re-edits. At their best, Global      Communication (or under their now-suppressed Jedi Knights moniker) seem      like the kind of guys who don't care where a record gets racked in the      stores provided it rocks the party-- without thinking they've reinvented the      wheel for realizing a Cure song and ""Bombs Over Baghdad"" are the same tempo.</p>
<p><i>Fabric 26</i> won't quite have the walls dripping with sweat, but it's      also a nice change pace from choking on sleek and vacuous electro-house,      clip-clop minimalism, and disco bongos played by bearded stoners. If      anything, <i>Fabric 26</i> is made up of <i>deeply</i> unfashionable      genres-- leftfield hip-hop, downtempo, broken beat, classic techno, and deep      house. (No one likes broken beat for cred purposes; go up to a haircut in a      Williamsburg bar and start excitedly talking about Daz-I-Kue and see if it      gets you laid.) Nine tracks of lazy hip-hop beats softly kick us onto the      dancefloor where we stand and nod and sip cocktails, stretching from the      bass-heavy loping wobble of Dabrye to a cut-and-scratch routine from      ex-junglist legend Danny Breaks. Steve Spacek curls some barely-there soul      like wisps from a menthol cigarette and Maspyke (who?) tongue twists over      liquid smoke horns on ""Lightly Anxious"". Things drift out of focus a bit in      the middle, ironically as the tempo picks up into Chicago and Detroit      revivalism. When the beat gets broken again towards the final fourth of the      disc, attention snaps back into focus in time with those swinging triplets.      (Seriously, it's a good genre, give it chance.) <i>Fabric 26</i> is maybe not      so good for dancing (even in your bedroom), but perfect for reading or, hey,      writing record reviews. And, like I said, it's a nice change of pace, one      that will probably sell approximately 1/8th of the proposed Villalobos      installment, if the Fabric people ever resort to the bamboo shoots it's      gonna take to get the disc outta him.</p>

The     violin's tweaking high notes and the cautious breath noises from the trumpet hint at a crisis that hits with full force when the heavy metal half of the band crashes in, loud and without warning. Frontman Toby Driver may look like he weighs 90 pounds wet but his delicate, wounded-doe croon can whip into a head-squeezing shriek. The band's combination of chamber instruments, psychedelia and metal gives it an almost delusional appeal, like absinthe chased with Genny Cream Ale, or the sparks you see on your eyelids when someone clocks you in the head. Church-burners and 10-year-old boys may think they're soft, and sometimes they struggle to find the right balance between both sides of the band. But if you like your violence framed by surreal mumbojumbo, you may find them awe-awakening; the slow sections are suspenseful, and the climaxes will make your hair jump off your head.</p>
<p>This Boston band, formed by ex-members of Maudlin of the Well, debuted with 2003's excellent <i>Choirs of the Eye</i>. This year's follow-up, <i>Dowsing Anemone With Copper Tongue</i>, is more methodical: the quality's more consistent, but they've lost <i>Choirs</i>' crazy highs and lurching segues. Kayo Dot has toured with both Khanate and Cerberus Shoal, and you can hear similitarities to both bands: Songs like ""Immortelle and Paper Caravelle"" have grave-like patience and small, scratchy gestures, while the strings and trumpet fuel a proggy instrumental on ""Aura on an Asylum Wall"", until a noisy outburst cuts it off. And the album's centerpiece, ""__ On Limpid Form"", drags you through a 13-minute death knell with guitars that groan like a bridge taking all day to collapse.</p>
<p>Driver has strengthened the two extremes of his singing-- blissed-out, or drawn and quartered-- and although the vocal passages are brief, they frame a satisfying release. He also uses his voice briefly and eerily on his solo debut from last fall, <i>In the L..L..Library Loft</i>, a more somnolent take on Kayo Dot's style. This one's on Tzadik, and yes, it's yet another in that label's non-stop catalog of horror soundtrack-style records-- but Driver handles the task well, and he delivers an engrossing, cinematic production that features Kayo Dot's Forbes Graham on trumpet and Mia Matsumiya on violin, tuning forks, and ""two-tongue vocal."" Tracks one and four especially are the keepers: ""Eptaceros"" delivers an entrancing exchange between Driver's voice and Graham's trumpet, while opener ""Kandu vs. Corky (Horrorca)"" scales the same molten heights as Kayo Dot, but with an all-chamber ensemble and two cavernous drummers pushing it forward. On this cut, you get the scale of metal without the rock beat or the attack-- leaving just the glory of cascading guitar noise and throat-wringing passion.

    Haze or ""Purple Haze"" or Purple Rain-- it's also got surprisingly
    little in common with Dischord's D.C. boys, considering that Ris Paul
    Ric happens to be former Q and Not U guitarist chRIS PAUL RIChards,
    capitalizing (get it, capitals?) on the band's recent breakup to go
    his own way: The album's 12 tracks seem like the byproduct of
    crooning jammy-clad on snow days spent waiting for your beard to
    grow-- such far, stripped-down acoustic cries are they from Q and Not
    U's post-hardcore shtick. But even when especially plaintive, Richards' oft-operatic pipes are still recognizable: his breathy ups and downs-- accompanied by electronic artist, Alien8's Tim Hecker this time-- are nothing short of lovely, even sentimental and dimmed.</p><p>
    If this smells like Postal Service, it isn't. The Richards/Hecker brand of electro-glum isn't techno-bumped, or over-blipped: It's bird calls and waterfalls and whistling-- the album's title track and opener, ""Purple Blaze"", foreshadows as much with its exhaled list of images, among them, ""the ordinary truth."" It's right on-- for the most part it's just Richards and that well-worn acoustic, the stuff of Simon and Garfunkel fanboydom-- but speaking of Jimi Hendrix (""Purple haze all in my brain/ Lately things just don't seem the same""), the world of <em>Purple Blaze</em> is some weird rainforesty, jungly one that's difficult to pinpoint exactly; it's hard to feel like you've ever completely gotten it, which doubles as both strength and shortcoming.</p><p>
    There are missteps, most notably ""Run Up Wild on Me"", which is what would happen if Michael Jackson/Prince/Justin Timberlake inseminated triplets in the same hipsterette, and music-for-aromatherapy ""D Y C N"" and ""P L B Z"", which can't hold candles to the album highlights such as the chillingly gorgeous ""Daft Young Cannibals"" or ""Purple Blaze"". The majority of tracks fall squarely between transcendent and lacking-- stuff for café open mics, like the snored ""The Sleeparound"" and the partially whistled ""I Wish You Love Me"", aren't groundbreaking but pleasant enough. That ""finch"" Richards warns about in ""<em>Purple Blaze</em>"" turns up on ""Colonialism"", kamikaze chirping. </p><p>
    Speaking of birds, the cover art's made to resemble a Penguin 20th Century Classic paperback: RIS PAUL RIC in caps, <em>Purple Blaze</em> italicized beneath it. Birds dream about their songs to better remember them in waking life, and in the end, this is what <em>Purple Blaze</em> seems like. In ""Hanging From the Grapevines"", Richards speaks of ""sending out songs beyond my control""; the chorus repeats itself till it's this perfect chant-- ""like the dream you won't remember""-- and that's just it: <em>Purple Blaze</em> is Ris Paul Ric's fragmented bird-dream recalled on too little sleeping, packing in Q and Not U's volatility, lacking only its pulled-togetherness, forecasting a wealth of good to come.</p></div>"|6951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6951-purple-blaze/|7.0|Rachel Khong

Either that, or we cast aside our grievances and compulsorily urge listeners to buy CDs for the children's sake, to save the rainforest, cure cancer, remember the 80s, whatever. Jnana's certainly not cutting me any slack on their critic-baiting <i>Not Alone compilation: the dilemma has been compounded by five CDs, hordes of adorable out-rock virtuosos, deluxe packaging, and an eminently worthy cause (the African HIV/AIDS pandemic). Jesus, they even threw in a track by a Pitchfork contributor and pledged all the proceeds to Doctors Without Borders. This box is bulletproof.  To lambaste it would be to insult human decency, and I refuse to be that one cynic who gave a 2.3 to the charitable saving-Africa set.</i></p><p>
    
    Curators Mark Logan and David Tibet (Current 93) assembled a sterling cast of freaks, misanthropes, and free spirits: industrial deviants (Coil, Nurse With Wound), New Weird Americans (Fursaxa, Six Organs of Admittance), Japanese noise gods (Keiji Haino, Ghost), folk legends (Linda Perhacs, Pearls Before Swine), tape-loop loons (William Basinski) and everyone ever affiliated with Michael Gira. Oh, what the hell, let's also throw in Allen Ginsberg and Teenage Fanclub. The track organization leaves something to be desired, but there's a decisive novelty to owning a disc that features both folk-revivalist Dolly Collins and bible-shredder Aube. Strangely, there's also a smattering of mundane Canadian bar bands. Logan ""sequenced this set with the hope that folks will listen to each disc in its entirety,"" and one must stoically withstand the brief and goofy mediocrity on each disc.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, there's at least <em>three hours</em> of quality material here, and the set mostly includes original and rare compositions. For a charity comp, the highlights are numerous and stubbornly experimental: On the introductory track, irr.app.(ext.) sets the standard with singular syntheses of finespun strums, Gregorian drones, wooden clocks, and Pan-Asian woodwinds. Mirror crafts glowing sinusoids, Eric Lanzillotta melts black-ice dub, and Tom Recchion spins reverberant neon vinyl over dust-covered choirs.  Personal favorites include the Hafler Trio's elegant noise, Charlemagne Palestine's withering gales, and Cyclobe's enticing intersection of drilled flatulence and photon pong.</p><p>
    
    But thoughts begin to wander somewhere around Hour 3, when the Bricoleur introduces his wind gyrations on ""Prah Pip Tah"". It's not a particularly dull piece, but the mind can only take outerworld spacescapes for so long. The more beat-based electronic music is also rather tepid (see Howie B.'s rote B-grade <em>Blade</em> noir or Edward Ka-Spel's confusing mix of glam vocals and 56k dial-up.)</p><p>
    
    Countering this series of bleeps and found-sound scratches is the awkward camp of former Belle &amp; Sebastian member Isobel Campbell, who adds more effete absurdity to ""The Beat Goes On"", and Sundial, who imagine that playing a garage version of the Osmond Brothers' ""Crazy Horses"" is the apex of revolutionary craftsmanship. Perhaps they feel obligated to propound pop schmaltz in the spirit of benefit albums. On the other end of the spectrum, Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's truly bizarre ""Song for Doctors Without Borders"", a sort of anti-""We Are the World"", unites elements of the Bible and Faust. The other acoustic performers seem to take sides in the battle between psych-folk classics and protracted pseudo-grunge. But it's easy to simply ignore the latter in favor of Richard Buckner's ironclad rasp or Six Organs' solar-flare opium den. </p><p>
    
    The sheer variety of songs is staggering, from Jarboe's belabored breathing to L's effortless Polynesian pixie dust. Even Ginsberg's ludicrous harmonium-and-viola Blake recitation seems pertinent to the proceedings. Simply put, <i>Not Alone compiles a tremendous wealth of magnificent material, and there's something charming about listening to a doe-eyed charity endeavor by such infamous pessimists as Nurse With Wound and Current 93. Still, between the erratic sequencing and the handful of mediocrities, <em>Not Alone</em> often sounds like an assortment of free CDs from <em>The Wire</em>, albeit with marginally better quality control. </i></p></div>"|2115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2115-not-alone/|7.7|Alex Linhardt

    <em>Lisbon</em>, which documents an October 2005 performance at the
    Galeria Zé Dos Bois in the Portuguese capitol, I get the idea Keith Whitman has done
    some thinking about structure. Here he uses the tools (guitar,
    processed via computer) and palette (an emphasis on slowly shifting
    drone) first brought to bear on his 2002 album <em>Playthroughs</em>, and
    extends them to suit a long-form piece.</p><p>
    The opening few minutes are close to ""Track3a (2waynice)"" from
    <em>Playthroughs</em>, with clean tendrils of drone only marginally more
    harmonically complex than a sine wave undulating in space like a
    Chinese dragon kite. Whitman gradually folds in additional layers and
    hints of counterpoint, from organ-like chords, soft bells, and an
    assortment of subtle glitches. The placid ramp upward lasts 13
    minutes, and then harsh chords creep in. From there it's a
    steady plow into dissonance, as sheets of noise are piled on and most
    traces of pleasantness are left behind. Had it started somewhere
    heavier, the knotty bass (please don't listen on computer speakers)
    churning away at the 20-minute mark would have long grown tiring. But
    after the crystalline foundation of the piece's first quarter, the
    snarling ugliness proceeds with an undercurrent of poignancy,
    magnified emotionally through careful arrangement.</p><p>
    Heard loud, filling a room, <em>Lisbon</em> can be a little overwhelming. The
    climax comes about three-fourths of the way in, around 27 minutes,
    where the gritty outer layer has been shed and the drone conjures
    images of a metaphysical ascension through clouds. A minute later, the
    engines cut out and it falls toward earth in a tumble of creaking
    furniture, blown fuses, and bent sprockets. Apparently, Whitman had
    microphones placed throughout the space to capture ambient noise, and
    he devised a patch to process it and add it to the mix. After the
    purely electronic immersion the live room sounds are jarring, but the
    piece quickly reassembles itself for a noisy sprint to the finish,
    with coarse sawtooth waves sparking fountains of harmonics. A wispy
    finish gives the piece a circular quality, ending very near the serene
    opening.</p><p>
    It's a 41-minute piece that, like Fennesz' <em>Live in Japan</em>, doesn't make
    much sense cut into smaller segments. The time commitment is an
    obstacle, but the payoff is substantial. It comes back to the
    trajectory. When I picture a successful long-form laptop set, the
    perfect arc is something launched low-- 35 degrees, say-- with great
    force and a heavy wind coefficient so the piece dies quickly after
    reaching its expressive peak. Whitman here has followed it to the
    letter, constructing a riveting piece of music with the organic drama
    of a three-act play.</p></div>"|8665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8665-lisbon/|8.6|Mark Richardson

    musical vocabulary. As they demonstrated on their <em>The Constant Lover</em> EP two years ago, 
    the band's sense of dynamics livens up its basic power trio 
    setup, ensuring that the flowing choruses and pensive bridges stand out from 
    the choppy verses, as well as keeping the basic minor key chord progressions fresh 
    with rhythmic variety.</p><p>
    
    If anything keeps <em>Dancing With Daggers</em> from equaling the EP, it's 
    the lack of a genuine show-stopper like ""The Constant Lover"". ""Wild Gardens"" 
    comes closest, rising out of a downtrodden verse on which vocalist Lexi 
    Valentine's voice mingles with the fuzz guitar to a soaring chorus that 
    manages to transform its melancholy vocal line into a sort of valediction 
    through rhythm.</p><p>
    
    And although nothing here tops that track, there are still plenty of other great, swooning melodies. 
    Valentine sings long, slow melodies over frenetic strumming and frenzied, 
    start-stop drumming on ""The Better Plan"", highlighting the natural 
    mournfulness that comes through in her thick alto, a set of pipes that would 
    have taken her far in the New Wave era. ""Artistic Condition"" explodes from 
    quiet, high-tempo verses into a shimmering chorus featuring a guitar part 
    strangely reminiscent of the Manic Street Preachers' ""No Surface All 
    Feeling"", while Nadia King's drum part on opener ""Bridge to Terabithia"" 
    never quite slips into a straight rhythm, instead letting the guitar and 
    bass carry the song's central rhythmic thrust.</p><p>
    
    The presence of Death From Above 1979's Jesse Keeler at the boards probably 
    has something to do with the nastier fuzztones that coat the bass and guitar 
    at various points in the album, but otherwise, the album is a natural 
    beefing up of the sound of the EP, with occasional added organ or 
    glockenspiel to accent the guitar parts. Considering that they're just now 
    barely old enough to drink when they head south of the Canadian border to 
    the U.S. (their age and the relative ease with which they procured a deal with 
    Paper Bag produced some early, jealousy-fueled backlash from fellow 
    musicians), they've developed an impressive sense of craft, and it seems 
    they can only go up from here.</p></div>"|5636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5636-dancing-with-daggers/|7.7|Joe Tangari

There is a notion that one way to find truth is to peer ever closer at things until you start noticing their constituent parts, and breaking them up into groups of increasingly smaller parts until you get to the one part that doesn't break. The thinking goes that whatever you can discern about this smallest essence is the most basic, universal truth about whatever it is you're looking at: Think sub-atomic particles in physics, or anytime you hear someone talk about their fave ""desert island"" records. These are supposed represent the prime, most important kernels of our musical tastes, and if you remove them from the equation, we're fundamentally different.</p><p>
    
    I was listening to Stereolab the other day, wondering how they might ""reduce."" Even more than most bands, their music seemed dependent on being more than the sum of its parts-- especially given the general consistency in their sound for so many years. Looking closer, I can break down individual albums as either good or bad, but that's a little too general (and many fans will tell you that they've yet to actually produce a ""bad"" album). So, I can go down to the songs, and say whether or not they work-- but then I lose the picture of the albums as a whole. Hmm, so maybe I should actually go down further, and see if the songs on each album share something-- perhaps an instrumental similarity, or a melodic element in common-- but I find that rather than bring me closer to an overarching truth about the band, I end up with dozens more questions than when I started. And I'm not exactly sure how any of this relates to the emotional rush I get from them at their best.</p><p>
    
    As Stereolab's 10th full-length, <em>Fab Four Suture</em>, makes clear, there is an extremely thin line between revealing your essence and revealing nothing at all. Although it sounds exactly like a latter day 'Lab album should sound (there I go trying to break down again), I find it maddeningly hard to tell you why except in terms so basic that they're almost totally useless: Laetitia Sadier still sings like Laetitia Sadier; the Farfisa still sounds like a Farfisa; the songs still sound like exotica spliced with sunshine psychedelia and krautrock. That last point may sound like I'm giving you some good, hard info-- but remember that it applies to just about every other Stereolab album as well. Overall, I'm less taken by this record than, say, last year's <em>Margerine Eclipse</em> or 2001's <em>Sound-Dust</em>, but am having a bitch of a time deciding why.</p><p>
    
    So, let's reduce a bit, starting with the songs. Out of 12, I can only hear a few that would stand out on previous records. The book-ending, two-parted tracks ""Kyberneticka Babicka"" are models of efficiency and refinement, and sound like golden milk pouring down out of the same blue sky that gave us the Beach Boys' ""'Til I Die"" and Philip Glass's great early piece <em>Music in 12 Parts</em>. Minimalism never sounded so pretty, all stuffed with harmony vocals and a heavenly chord progression. ""Get a Shot of the Refrigerator"" isn't quite as distinctive, but does do some nifty tricks with the beat, showcasing a particularly funky side of the band at the bridge.</p><p>
    
    Conversely, there are lots of songs that seem interchangeable with dozens of others in Stereolab's catalog: ""Eye of the Volcano"", with cooing Marxism from Sadier and trombone counterpoint is <em>Cobra &amp; Phases</em> redux; ""Vodiak"" is more energetic, but the melody and harmony accompaniment are textbook for the band, and the up-tempo groove could have fit in unnoticed on <em>Mars Audiac Quintet</em> or <em>ETK</em>. Analog-synth heavy tunes like ""Widow Weirdo"" or ""Plastic Mile"" seem like outtakes from 2000's <em>First of the Microbe Hunters</em>, itself an EP that sounded stuffed of outtakes. But the question is if the worst I can say about <em>Fab Four</em> is that it sounds too much like Stereolab, how can it be bad? I mean, I like Stereolab!</p><p>
    
    The crux of reductionism is that it never actually adds up to the whole picture. <em>Fab Four Suture</em> doesn't inspire me because I rarely actually have to hear it-- stepping back, my ears tell me that I have, in fact, already heard it countless times before. The songs don't so much flow into each other, as exist as vague siblings, joining hands if not necessarily contributing to a higher bond. There is nothing intrinsically bad about it of course, but the album is consumed by the already menacingly ""not intrinsically bad""-ness of their canon. Stereolab have produced more good music than most bands I know, but over time, I'm coming to the realization that it isn't necessarily localized in any one place. That makes it hard to recommend <em>any</em> particular Stereolab album over another, much less <i>Fab Four, but it also leaves the band a perpetually open door for fans.</i></p></div>"|7505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7505-fab-four-suture/|6.6|Dominique Leone

I dare you to even work it into casual conversation, without someone thinking that you're alluding to Sammy Hagar or Tom Cochrane or David Brent. The heinous phrase is code, I hope, for a classified ad that Coxon should have already placed: <small>LYRICIST WANTED. WILL PAY IN NME AWARDS</small>. Love's already a battlefield, and the drug, and hurts, and will tear us apart, but did you know that it also broke the speed limit?</p><p>
    Coxon's latest contains a pretty sweet almost-hour of idea-less rock on which he sounds less like a veteran than an upstart. To obligatorily bring up the old war: Anyone who cherished how the last Oasis record triumphantly channeled the energy of that band's ancestors should enjoy this homage to the roots of Blur. Always a tad tighter and less daft than their Stones-baiting rivals, the Blur co-helmed by Coxon owed a debt to 45s that came out between the peak of the Who knockoff glut up until right before Manchester ""happened."" Thus this quaintly brash album stomps into the retroturf of bands referred to sniggeringly as the Pistols and the 'Cocks. (Spiked leather restraints, and this album's clunky ballads, are keeping me from typing a <em>Punklife</em> pun.)</p><p>
    Contradiction city: These are drinking songs, sadistically, from an artist famously on the wagon. The titles and lyrics are 90% cliché, but Coxon makes them poignant via the refrain (on ""Don't Believe Anything I Say"") of ""I'll be thinking about these words forever,"" which seems as much an admission of writer's block as it does a taunt about being purposefully direct, even if it results in sounding (ewww) conventional. The power-pop is so deliberately rigid-- its Townsend is jagged and even its jangle is abrupt-- that iPodded variety-addicts might long for an interval with Doherty's huh-we-taping? shambles. And why in the world is a rugged flashback record hosting adult contemporary saxomophone-jam ""Flights in the Sea (Lovely Rain)""? So you've outlived Jesus and have a wonderful daughter, Mr. Coxon; congrats-- no need to go all ""mature"" on us. </p><p>
    Pardon my statesideism, but he sounds like a British David Lowery. No, wait, he sounds like the Rentals when they ""went British"" for that second album. Except he's pissed off and backed by big nasty organs on the disappointment-addicted ""You Always Let Me Down"". Except he's either homoerotically covetous or angry at younger models on ""What's He Got"": ""Got a brown leather jacket and tight blue jeans/ Wears a pair of Beatle boots just like me."" If I may stoop to tabloid conjecture, doesn't the first line, ""Saw you on the corner by the cash machine"" suggest that Hard-Fi are among his targets? </p><p>
    A buoyant guitarist has gotten over abstraction, which makes life momentarily difficult for his haymaking critics. The slightness of this album is hard to hold a grudge against, but ain't nothing oh-my-god necessary about it either. ""Gimme Some Love"", for example, is one of the dumber things that an artist can command, but damn if Coxon doesn't demand it riotously and convincingly. </p></div>"|1646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1646-love-travels-at-illegal-speeds/|7.0|William Bowers

    Young's ""Composition 1960 #10"". One vector leads here, to slender,
    interwoven strands of drone braided from processed guitar, vibraphone,
    and assorted electronics. A first listen to this kind of minimalism
    brings to mind questions of purity. One wonders just how tightly the
    beam of sound will be focused, whether the music will exist
    exclusively on a long thin wire, fully accessible only with
    magnification. What sort of commitment will it take to follow the
    changes, sense the development, and hear what's really going on?</p><p>
    
    In the case of Chihei Hatakeyama, releasing his first solo album
    after a number of collaborations with like-minded Tokyo improvisers,
    the answer to the question of purity is ""not so pure, really.""
    Hatakeyama uses the palette of the True Drone Believers but he seeds
    his overstretched chords with easy pleasures. It's in the way the
    monolithic chord with harmonics like a pipe organ fills the first two
    minutes of ""Swaying Curtain in the Window"", only to slowly dissolve
    into a tinkling music box melody and, finally, clouds of acoustic
    guitar picking. So while the processed whine of ""Bonfire on the Field""
    evokes the exquisite singularity of Keith Whitman's <em>Playthroughs</em>
    system, ""Towards a Tranquil Marsh"" combines that mediation on the held
    tone with a relaxed tune and identifiable chords, a campfire song from
    a planet with two suns. Throughout <em>Minima Moralia</em>, Hatakeyama thinks
    of sound as vibration first, but conventional ideas about when such
    movement becomes music quickly come into play.</p><p>
    
    It's true, yes, a number of musicians are already working his ground,
    but Hatakeyama has his own voice. There's a distance here that
    develops in part from the music's deep undercurrent of calm. Weighed
    against the delicacy and surface-level charm is an odd sense of remove
    that keeps the music from becoming overly sentimental. And you never
    get the sense that something surprising lurks around the corner, which
    might strike some as a negative but to me gives the music a greater
    sense of expansiveness. Only on the closing ""Beside a Well"" does any
    real dissonance creep in, as Hatakeyama gradually piles on distortion
    until his music finally crosses over into places covered by Tim Hecker
    and, more recently, Belong. A hint, maybe, of where his music might
    one day go; in any event, he's off to an excellent start.</p></div>"|4035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4035-minima-moralia/|8.1|Mark Richardson

On the way, the Markers have also found time to issue their righteously chaotic Ecstatic Peace album <em>I Trust My Guitar, Etc.</em> in addition to the obligatory slew of homemade cassettes and CD-Rs. But to this point the group's recorded output has resembled a series of blurred snapshots of a massive, writhing serpent-- with each occasional glimpse of fang, tongue, or rattle obscured in a cloud of furious, scaly motion. And so it continues on their latest sustained leap into the void, <em>A Panegyric to the Things I Do Not Understand</em>, an album that yet again faithfully captures the trio's brutal sonics in all their impulsive, erratic splendor.</p><p>
<em>Panegyric</em> is the first of the Markers' works to see an official CD release, and as such it showcases a corresponding (if incremental) progress in recording fidelity. Mastered by kindred spirit Matt Valentine, the album still maintains the appearance of a live document, particularly in the inchoate gush of Elisa Ambrogio's hyper-charged, extemporaneous vocals. If there was any significant post-production sweetening it wasn't particularly effectual, as the album is split into two equal-length tracks-- the California side and the Paris side-- each of which unfolds with the halting, asymmetric momentum of an especially turbulent real-time event.</p><p> 
    
    When spouting at peak efficiency, Magik Markers are able to incorporate an astonishing breadth of influence into their mulching, free-rock hysteria. At base level, the group operates in a fertile vein of unaffiliated Harry Pussy/Dead C noise, but with a further emphasis on pure, low-octane garage thud. Panegyric also contains the echoes of everything from standard No Wave scribbling to the free-blasting improvisations of Sonny and Linda Sharrock, to the burlesque dementia of Suckdog. Much of this exhaustive versatility can be credited to drummer Pete Nolan, who can return the most outward-bound clatter instantly to a tribal, Godz-like primitivism. Ambrogio and bass guitarist Lea Quimby both sound in fine fettle as well, with Elisa's manic exhortations on the first track eventually devolving into an extended passage of collective subhuman whistles, chirps and grunts.</p><p> 
    
    More recent pre-histories are explored on the second track, as Ambrogio's prolonged, fervent rap makes lyrical reference to AC/DC, Patti Smith, and the MC5, perhaps in an implicit attempt to secure a place for Magik Markers in that heady pro-rock lineage. Despite the Markers' obvious talent for spontaneous invention and their deceptively ambitious reach, however, their work still contains far too many hesitant passages that in quainter times might've been worked out in the rehearsal room. (And would it kill them to give Nolan's drums proper authority in the mix, or for Elisa to refrain from straying off-mic in mid-verse?) Sporadically triumphant though it is, this <em>Panegyric</em> remains too studded with false leads and curious periods of inaction to truly rank as the all-devouring, avant-rock juggernaut that the trio appears capable of someday delivering. </p></div>"|5680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5680-a-panegyric-to-the-things-i-do-not-understand/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

    got a brand new sound. Was a time when <em>The Bends</em>-lites flickered like Nokia, but
    aside from ""You're Beautiful"" the Radiohead/Coldplay clone
    attack has been quiet on most fronts. Well, Norwegian
    singer/songwriter Even Johensen looks at Stars, sees how they shine.
    His second album under the Magnet moniker places Chris Martin's frail
    fix-yous amid slow, splashy MORtronica, kinda like Savage Garden
    posing as Canada's eighth-most-important band.</p><p>
    
    On <em>The Tourniquet</em>, Stars' tourmate shares that deservedly
    celebrated band's mannered lushness. Power-popper Jason Falkner, of
    Jellyfish fame, lacquers the production just enough to keep the varied
    arrangements background-friendly. When someone tells Suj-fan about the
    banjos and hushed vocals of ""Duracellia"", he's not going to insult
    them, but the Specials might miss the slow guitar skank of murky ""All
    You Ask"". Still, somehow even the frequently employed strings, synths,
    and music-box tinkles don't muss the David Grayness of a basic
    palette-- warm keyboards, acoustic guitars 'n' beats-- that tries a
    bit too hard not to offend.</p><p>
    
    Which is exactly why this disc can fill the post-Coldplay void on your
    mixtapes. After deceptively intricate verses that do
    their best to go unnoticed, the vaguely reassuring choruses
    leap out, as high-caloric as the afore-hinted James Blunt-- or Edwin
    McCain. ""You'll get through this if you hold on,"" Johensen sings on
    opener ""Hold On"", his throat catching just so before the song
    disintegrates into elegant but empty a cappella harmonies. ""You sing
    like an angel/ And I fall at your feet,"" goes a similarly overstated
    hook on ""Fall at Your Feet"", the one to YSI your unsuspecting beloved.
    Pretty much every chorus is as vapidly manipulative, from the swooning
    ""Miss Her So"" (Johensen: ""...and I can't let go"") to the equally
    massive ""Deadlock"", so that the album's only surprise, only
    conventionally bum note is following the Christopher Marlowe-esque
    ""Take my hand/ And I will follow"" with an awkward simile involving the
    album's title.</p><p>
    
    Like much of <em>X&amp;Y;</em>, Magnet is exceptionally unobtrusive, music to
    ignore: Falkner's gentle touches will never disturb yours, and
    Magnet's soft murmurs are as familiar as your computer's
    now-imperceptible hum. ""I'm gonna do this my own way...I might as well
    believe in me,"" Johensen sings, echoing John Lennon, and he has
    covered both Dylan and Cash. So why's he so intent on becoming a
    more lavish Keane?</p></div>"|5679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5679-the-tourniquet/|4.1|Marc Hogan

It's almost unfair.  Draped in luscious, acute reverb, every phrase is granted its own pitch-perfect spotlight, and each precious syllable stands alone as a singular accomplishment.  On <em>Fox Confessor Brings the Flood</em>, Neko Case's peerless cries crash through the mix with unprecedented force, their natural grandeur captured in sonorous surround sound.</p><p>
    
    But it's not all about the voice; songs are important, too.  Case's lungs-for-days Dollywood boom may be as direct an emotional instrument as there is in contemporary music, but her increasingly prominent songwriting skills tend to eschew visceral connections for intellectual intrigue and poetic mystery-- and <em>Flood</em> features Case's most cryptic lyrics to date.  The odd disconnect here between singer and songwriter is absorbing: Though shaded by finely-tuned, country-noir twang, the rapturous belter's high-minded lyrical aspirations often undermine her throat's unhindered veracity.</p><p>
    
    Given her former life as an art-school punk, Case's increasingly independent, non-traditional songwriting trajectory isn't totally surprising.  Moving from the countrified mix of covers and originals of her solo debut, 1997's <em>The Virginian</em>, to 2000's <em>Furnace Room Lullaby</em>, which featured mostly originals co-written by Case, to 2002's <em>Blacklisted</em>, on which the singer wrote most of the alluringly bluesy songs on her own, Case's musical ambitions have evolved and taken greater definition with each successive album.</p><p>
<em>Flood</em> finds Case continuing to write the lion's share of her material, while also producing and mixing.  Appropriately, it's a logical extension of the themes, instrumentation, and mood of <em>Blacklisted</em>.  Long gone are the relatively straightforward <em>Furnace</em>-era break-up laments with their simple-yet-effective couplets like, ""Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', how can you forget/ All the love we had between us, now it's like we never met.""  Removing herself from many of the album's David Lynch-like narratives, Case often embraces the role of omnipotent storyteller.</p><p>
    
    One such twisty tale is the harrowing rich-girl/poor-girl opener, ""Margaret Vs. Pauline"".  Strolling alongside a frolicking, Jon Brion-esque piano, wordy descriptors and odd details inform a striking gap between the song's haunting title pair.  Describing the blessed beauty Pauline, Case sings, ""And they placed an ingot in her breast to burn cool and collected/ Fate holds her firm in its cradle and then rolls her for a tender pause to savor.""  Lines like that don't roll off with ease, but within the scheme of the album, they can add up to something palpably uncomfortable-- a vague, inescapable sense of loss.</p><p>
    
    Confessional only in the most roundabout sense, Case's songs set up strange anecdotal skeletons that beg listeners to connect the dots between.  ""Star Witness"" may be about a car accident, a shooting, a deep love wiped away, or all of those things.  Bound together by an awe-inspiring, harmony-laden hook, the swaying waltz may seem like free-associating farce at first, but subsequent exposures offer slight turns.  There's no right answer to ""Star Witness"", but its keen open-endedness is an appealing destination in itself. Such complex examples of Case's unique songwriting string theory abound, from the ghostly, near-a cappella ""A Widow's Toast"", to the quasi-political, fable-based title track, to ""Dirty Knife"", a haunted-house elegy to madness.  Each track relies on a starkly defined bleakness to guide its queasy understanding of an existence between the bitter end and its sometimes-sweeter aftermath.</p><p>
    
    What once again prevents Case from delivering a front-to-back classic is a perfectionist streak that accounts for <i>Flood</i>'s mannered meticulousness.  A nice-enough reinterpretation of traditional folk spiritual ""John Saw That Number"" rumbles along amiably but Case can't adequately summon the spontaneous affectations that the gospel-style track requires to truly transcend. Though she often cites churchly touchstone Bessie Griffin as a guiding influence, it seems as if Case's hard-line precision rarely allows her to encapsulate Griffin's untethered style and act in the moment. Such flawless phrasing can cause songs to become too treasurable, as if they're off-limits, encrusted under a thick glass casing.</p><p>
    
    Still, nobody today does eerie dust-bowl balladry and anachronistic rustic-murder milieu quite like Case.  Combining country, folk, and old-school rock, she faithfully invokes scenes of late-night wandererings illuminated by a jalopy's
    lone functional headlight.  As a refined version of <i>Blacklisted</i>, <i>Flood</i> provides alluring riddles and obsessive desolation, Case subverting her easy-access vocals with difficult abstractions and heady projections.  Yet, after fishing through <em>Flood</em>'s 12 intricate tracks, a plainspoken love song delivered in that voice would not be unwelcome.</p></div>"|1325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1325-fox-confessor-brings-the-flood/|7.7|Ryan Dombal

In this milieu, songs can simply be collections of broad ironic/iconic gestures; guitar solos are simultaneously hilarious and awesome; lyrics may consist of little more than a series of in-jokes and cheeky allusions. It's irreverent, indifferently erratic in style, and goes to great measures to show it doesn't take itself too seriously. I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness belongs to a different genus of indie rock, one that I mentally file as S.I.R., or ""Serious Indie Rock."" Exemplified by bands like Interpol, Calla, and, to an extent, grandiose yet traditionally narrative post-rock outfits like Explosions in the Sky, this style of indie eschews irony, pop culture trawling, and genre hopscotch. It's reverent, recondite, and stylistically consistent.</p><p>
<em>Fear Is on Our Side</em>, ILYBICD's full-length follow-up to their promising debut EP, has the S.I.R. aesthetic dead to rights. The band's nominal choices demonstrate a penchant for mannered esotericism. The record cover is black, decorated only with a blue heart/inverted cross logo of ambiguous meaning but massive branding potential. The vocals, even when they become impassioned, are as remote as distant stars. The lyrics are grand in tone but minimal in content; devoid of humor and rhetorical flourish they pass by almost unnoticed in the music's grey gleam. The guitars shimmer, echo, and press relentlessly upward, but with an elegant museum quality, hermetically sealed in glass cases. The songs are uniformly rigid and linear, resistant to areas of slippage or the happy accident, minutely sculpted until their evocative power becomes almost clinical.</p><p>
    
    If there's a sterility to ILYBICD's music, it's counterbalanced by the commanding presence with which it imbues the songs, gracing them with the familiar yet persistently stimulating impact of film-trailer voiceovers. You know your emotional state is being deliberately manipulated-- of course you do; it's what you paid for. ""The Ghost"" slinks along with a precise accumulation of majestic gestures-- a chiming guitar dirge and an ominous synth drone, an outsized elastic bassline, emphatically punchy tempo shifts, lugubrious vocals in barely differentiated harmony, long repetitive arcs of concisely ascending chords. ""According to Plan"" threads silvery filaments of guitar through a goose-stepping fuzz bassline and rigid yet splashy drums. ""We Choose Faces"" lays a tight, trebly coil of guitar atop a pillowy piano phrase before the rhythm section asserts structural integrity. </p><p>
    
    An aspect of S.I.R. that I've yet to address is its propensity to be most affecting at the moments when it comes unbuttoned, relaxing its rhythmic and stylistic rigor. On Interpol's debut, this moment came with ""NYC"", where Paul Banks's voice drifted over a strum that was loose and jangly compared to the streamlined contours of the record proper. For ILYBICD, the moment comes with ""Today"", graced with all the inspiring incandescence of the Smashing Pumpkins song with which it shares a name, and bringing the Explosions in the Sky comparison above fully into play. Pneumatic percussion respires like a living thing; a stately procession of ringing guitars and expansively woozy synths flows around the prayerful vocals; a mammoth bassline shows up fashionably late and joins the crisply intensifying percussion in flogging the song toward a dazzling crescendo. If the bulk of the album is for the car, the bar, the social occasion, then moments like this are for headphones, bedrooms, intimate and solitary states. The presence of both increases the breadth of this assured LP, and establishes ILYBICD as being no longer a band to watch, but a band to listen to. </p></div>"|4151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4151-fear-is-on-our-side/|7.6|Brian Howe

Over the course of a handful of limited-edition LP's and CD-R's, Blackshaw has established himself as an instrumentalist of astonishing grace and delicacy, seeming as though he's gobbled and digested whole the primitive folk canons of Takoma and Vanguard. Relying primarily on 12-string guitar, Blackshaw's intricate creations web together Robbie Basho's wayfaring mysticism, Ben Chasny's soft-focused acid tongues, and the rustic fantasias of Sandy Bull. Blackshaw's latest release <em>O True Believers</em> is his best-sounding and most complete work yet; its every dazzling figure cast in amber sunbeams as his playing moves in a decidedly baroque direction, his compositional engines laboring to outpace his nimble fingers.</p><p>
    
    The slight imbalance between Blackshaw's skills as a composer and those as a guitarist are most noticeable on the album's opening convocation ""Transient Life in Twilight"". Utilizing a thick, John Fahey-like open tuning, this lengthy piece has a circular, repetitive construction that fixes attention on Blackshaw's nearly inhuman dexterity. As the track gathers momentum, his immaculate playing achieves a cascading, harp-like complexity, sounding almost as if Blackshaw has the ability to lift and strum a small harpsichord. Impressive though his playing his, however, the 11-minute track feels a fraction overlong as it reiterates its simple melody with a single-minded concentration that suggests Blackshaw might be perfectly content to continue on indefinitely.</p><p> 
    
    Even longer is the album's 18-minute centerpiece ""The Elk With Jade Eyes"", but here Blackshaw has wisely chosen to branch out instrumentally, adding elements of sitar, harmonium, and hand percussion to the track's crystalline wells. This rapturous epic unfurls with a patient, snake-charming grandeur. Blackshaw hammers his guitar like an Appalachian dulcimer one minute, and tenderly plucks it like a Renaissance lute the next to craft his utterly singular cross-traditional tapestry. The track's evocative, otherworldly spirit lingers on the following ""Spiraling Skeleton Memorial"", which has the intoxicating languor of a late evening gondola serenade. On the set-closing title track, a lilting chorus is carried by what is credited as harmonium but sounds as much like a wistful melodica. Rippling with chimes and percussion, this irresistible song is as close as Blackshaw gets to conforming to a standard pop structure, and by this evidence he shows an effortless knack for more straightforward melodic forms.</p><p> 
    
    Right now the field for folk-based guitarists is becoming crowded with unique and exceptional talents-- Chasny, Jack Rose, Matt Valentine, Richard Bishop-- so Blackshaw's greatest obstacle at this point might simply be listener fatigue. Yet as the radiant <em>O True Believers</em> illustrates, Blackshaw is able to differentiate himself through his exotic lyricism, stray pan-ethnic flourishes and pure unmasked virtuosity, while his youth suggests he's only just begun to tap his true capabilities.</p></div>"|1197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1197-o-true-believers/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

The Berlin brothers lived in the manse on the hill above a huge apartment complex for divorcees. Some of the frustrated single-parent-household kids would beat up Eve, Bosh, and Lillian for delivering newspapers while wearing tight pants and makeup and for working as parking lot attendants while being lean and groovy and speaking in elliptical rants that referenced Voltaire and Iggy Pop. One Halloween, they went trick-or-treating dressed as T. Rex and got pummeled by some kids dressed as AC/DC. I remember hearing that Bosh and Eve wanted to go back for revenge, but Lillian told them that absorption was a better tactic: ""We'll just sop that whole proletariat choad-rock thing into our androgynous interplanetary millionaire shtick.""</p><p>
    
    Okay, I made that up, but I had to, because the Living Things CD was playing, and not enough was going on with that to keep me entertained. Their energy, ambition, and audible influences, should have congealed for a knockout-- imagine the Reid brothers and Wayne Kramer uniting to form JAMC5, but hoping for radio play in the 90s. Steve Albini's recordings balance the crunch and the polish. The political lyrics are even grounded in theology (a la Dylan) to keep them from fading with the headlines. But this band that tries to be everything ends up seeming like a cipher.</p><p>
    
    Maybe the Living Things' combination of sincere poses is coming too soon after the ripple of ironic hard-rock bands? Opener ""Bombs Below"" employs a vintage choral fist-pumpy chant that Electric Six used semi-satirically on both of their albums, right before solos done in similar guitar tones. Maybe people are momentarily finding the glitz-retro clones not much different than Elvis impersonators or Civil War re-enactors? Dopey simulacra abound; every bar scene contains a group of pretty enough dudes who are to Mott the Hoople what a McDonalds Playland is to Walt Disney World. Maybe the Los Angeles circuit inspires bands to perform with a hyperdramatic larger-than-lifeness that's hard to swallow? I just saw She Wants Revenge prance and leer and sway beyond the honey-mustard quotidian fringe in which most of us earn our rent, and I was praying for a life-size savior, even if life looked like, well, A.C. Newman. </p><p>
    
    I really want to cheer their political anthems, but currently, ""glam"" and ""international conflict"" bring up Gary Glitter's indiscretions with Vietnamese tweens on my brain's Google Image search. Besides, party riffs have already been paired with anti-establishment gospel manifestoes by the Make Up, and war-on-terror already got the seventies-rawk treatment by Bobby Conn. Neither of those bravura acts won the chance to perform on all the late shows. Nor did they get a Cingular commercial for a two year-old album that, bless its heart, went through three major labels and two releases. (<em>Ahead of the Lions</em> is masterfully sequenced; the one-trick party moves along more smoothly than the nine of these songs did on 2004's <em>Black Skies in Broad Daylight</em>.) </p><p>
    
    I kept thinking that these guys would blow up late like the Counting Crows did, giving this review a semi-relevant sheen, but I have a feeling that record store clerks somewhere are building girlfriends out of Living Things promos, the way I used to with a stack of <i>August &amp; Everything Afters before the sudden popularity of ""Mr. Jones"" ended the dream. Fans of handclaps, who don't mind that Berlin sings as many lines about doing lines as he does protest lines, marching lines and battle lines, will have fun pretending to be epic along with these Velvet Ramones. </i></p></div>"|5004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5004-ahead-of-the-lions/|5.8|William Bowers

Even if the only path to creating something new is playing cut-and-paste with pre-existing styles and genres, it hasn't all been done before. Exhibit A: Stephen McBean's Pink Mountaintops and Black Mountain projects, which stitch together instantly recognizable references and proudly wear them on their sleeves. But in McBean's case, there's always a singular songwriter behind the pastiche, anchoring the music with something weightier than the sum of its influences.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for San Francisco's Society of Rockets. For their sophomore effort, <em>Where the Grass Grows Black</em>, the band sheds the subdued shoegaze of its debut for an unconvincing hodgepodge of classic rock flavors. The album oozes with nostalgia and a sense of uncanny familiarity, but it never rises far above homage. And even if it's stacked with high-octane rock and irrepressible melody, the Rockets draw so liberally from classic sources, there are hardly any surprises. On opener ""Tangerines &amp; Cigarettes"", the Rockets get their sticky fingers all over 70s-era Stones brass sections. ""Out in the Evening"" saunters up with all the swagger of T. Rex boogie. And ""DrX"" strays a short distance from the classic rock playbook: It's a bluesy take on the Jesus and Mary Chain, embellished with some chaotic Ron Asheton licks. But rather than using these stylistic touchstones as building blocks to construct something all its own, the Rockets seem content to settle for a kind of classic rock paint-by-numbers act.</p><p>
    
    The best moments on <em>Where the Grass Grows Black</em> are when the band revisits the lulling and elegiac tone of <em>Sunset Homes</em>. ""Suicide Summer"" is a velvety two-chord dirge backed by restrained floor toms. Bandleader Joshua Babcock leads a call-and-response vocal, cataloging a summer's worth of ""small suicides""-- from the banal (""all the dishes in the sink"") to the nauseatingly starry-eyed (""all the broken believers""). These exchanges build slowly before they segue into a chorus of soaring harmonies and crisp cymbal crashes. </p><p>
    
    The last two songs find the Rockets sounding more like itself than a cover band. With its warm organ tones, reverb-soaked vocals and sustained strings, ""The Longest Mile You'll Ever Walk"" is the album's most ethereal song-- and one that, frustratingly, lasts less than two minutes. On the obligatory epic closer, ""Old Glory"", the Rockets finally use the sonic elements of the album to forge an individual sound. After an intro in which meandering horn phrases snake around each other, the band launches into its most languorous number, providing a more fitting backdrop for Babcock's delicate vocals (despite his ham-fisted anti-war lyrics). It's a relief for the listener and a revelatory moment for the band, as if it had to endure an album's worth of false steps and classic rock copycatting to carve out a space to call its own.</p></div>"|7800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7800-where-the-grass-grows-black/|5.4|John Motley

    proud fellas infiltrating the notoriously macho punk rock scene was an even greater risk than it is today. But what better way to shake things up than with bold, hilarious lyrics about gay sex and homosexual  
    relationships? San Francisco's Pansy Division became a quintessential  
    ""queercore"" band, and by sharing the stage with Green Day,  
    the Supersuckers, Mr. T Experience, and the Vandals, they exposed  
    tons of people to a new musical subculture. <em>The Essential</em> presents 31 tracks  
    plucked from the band's six out-of-print Lookout Records LPs, various  
    EPs, compilations, and their recent Alternative Tentacles release.</p><p>
    
    Pansy Division's earliest material sounds similar to many  
    of their Lookout counterparts-- short, upbeat pop- 
    punk songs with catchy choruses, jangly guitars, pop-friendly backing vocals. In short, fun, three-chord punk at its best, all wrapped in song titles like  
    ""Boyfriend Wanted"" or ""The Cocksucker Club"", both from the band's  
    debut, <em>Undressed</em>.</p><p>
    
    The band's sound slightly evolved over the course of its  
    first few albums. ""Deep Water"", from 1994's <em>Deflowered</em>, is an  
    adolescent tale of raging hormonal confusion that blends quick  
    acoustic guitar strumming with fuzzy punk rock. The band perfected the style on that album's ""Groovy Underwear"", a hilarious ode  
    to whitey-tighties.  
    Light-hearted love-and-lust tunes and upbeat tales of homoeroticism  
    make up most of the tracks from <em>Pileup</em> (1995), <em>Wish I'd  
    Taken Pictures</em> (1996), and <em>More Lovin' From Our Oven</em>  
    (1997). Tracks such as ""Horny in the Morning"", ""Dick of Death"", and ""Luv  
    Luv Luv"" are fine examples of how fun pop-punk can be, and  
    ""Headbanger"" is a cheeky goof on heavy metal, complete with a guitar  
    solo by ""Al Shatonia"", aka Metallica's Kirk Hammet.</p><p>
    
    By 1998's <em>Absurd Pop Song Romance</em>, the band's sound revealed a  
    great deal of growth. The songs are slower, a little more  
    complex, and the lyrical content begins to change a bit. ""You're  
    Gonna Need Your Friends"", for example, is a sad tune about how  
    friends help you through a breakup. On 2003's <em>Total Entertainment! 
    </em> they dropped even more of their earlier humor and began to  
    tackle heavier social issues. ""No Protection"" is a dance tune  
    about the increasing HIV rate among gay men, and this boy-meets-boy  
    story differs from so many of their earlier songs when our narrator  
    turns down sex when his potential partner refuses to wear a condom.</p><p>
    
    While the social climate in the U.S. has changed  
    considerably since Pansy Division first started-- despite the crass use of anti-homosexual ballot measures as a tool to mobilize right-wing voters, support for gay rights has increased in the past two decades-- there are still a lot of important things for queercore bands to say, and  
    plenty of people, both straight and gay, for them to shock.</p></div>"|6149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6149-the-essential/|7.8|Cory D. Byrom

The entire LP clocks under 45 minutes. Ordinarily, this isn't the kind of thing you'd bother pointing out in a record review, but it bears mentioning because Mogwai are typically at their best when they let their music breathe, ebb, flow, and stretch, rather than constrict it or force it into smaller boxes.  Their first and still greatest album, <em>Young Team</em>, showed no compunction regarding songs that extended beyond 10 minutes to make their point, and on that scale, they made the best points of their career.
    Last year's phenomenal <em>BBC Sessions</em> disc drove this home even further.  Simply put, restraint does not become them.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, restraint is a major point of order on <em>Mr. Beast</em>, as it has been to varying degrees on their past few studio efforts.  Though the record is at no loss for power, it mostly stores it as unrealized potential: This doesn't sound like the same Mogwai that flattens audiences and then asks if the show was loud enough.  Opener ""Auto Rock"" begins with a quiet piano that gains intensity as other instruments join in, phaser and distorted guitar rising like dust as the volume grows.  The drumbeat verges on childlike-- a simple whack on every beat and no embellishment of any kind.  But after building for just over four minutes, and then coming to an unremarkable close, it fails to leave much of an impression.</p><p>
    
    The album recovers somewhat with ""Glasgow Mega-Snake"", which economically distills the essence of the band's crushing live show into three-and-a-half minutes of gut-punching nastiness.  Its buildup pays off with a wrenching tempo shift and vicious guitar riff that leaves behind a weightless groove, proving it's possible for Mogwai to sustain their intensity in bite-size packages.  Penultimate song ""I Chose Horses"" gets a lot of mileage out of the juxtaposition of an evenly spoken Japanese dialogue (courtesy Tetsuya Fukagawa of Japanese hardcore band Envy) against a fluctuating, mournful backdrop whose guitars are nearly indistinguishable from its synths; the primary asset of closer ""We're No Here"" is its sheer deafening loudness.</p><p>
    
    The other vocal tracks switch things up nicely: ""Acid Food"" offers one of the album's most unexpectedly beautiful moments when a pedal steel enters after the second chorus, which is sung through a vocoder.  But that song's aesthetic partner, ""Travel Is Dangerous"", is considerably more unruly, with two-part harmonies being doused by a wall of screaming guitar in the chorus.  In combination, the two songs serve to remind that post-rock can come across as more sketched than fleshed when not properly unleashed.</p><p>
<i>Mr. Beast</i>'s shortcomings lie not with what's present, but with what's missing.  Mogwai are capable of tremendous beauty, poignant gloom, and ear-splitting sonic pyrotechnics, but only transcend when they combine each of these elements.  Here, they rarely give themselves enough building room to conjoin these moods and styles.  Resultantly, despite its peaks, the album is no match for Mogwai's best work.</p></div>"|5371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5371-mr-beast/|6.8|Joe Tangari

That's right, the group that spent nearly 20 years giving the flannel finger to the world is now putting on its best po-face and dropping bon mots like, ""I want a world run by giant brains/ Instead of small-minded arrogant fools."" That not-so-quotable moment comes from <em>Under a Billion Suns</em> opener ""Where Is the Future"", a five-minute treatise on the qualitative gulf between 1960s science fiction and 21st century science fact that an earlier version of the group might have titled, ""Dude, Where's My Bubble Car?""  Sadly, this ain't your older brother's (...father's?!) Mudhoney.</p><p>
    
    Over the course of the album, listeners learn that we killed the Kennedys (""It Is Us""), being middle class means never having to apologize for taking out a second mortgage (""Empty Shells""), and war does actually suck (""Hard-On for War""). In case it isn't clear, we are now officially out of grace.  Mark Arm's voice is the perfect conduit for withering one-liners and bathroom-wall rejoinders, the Gen X <i>lingua franca</i> that still carries plenty of cachet.  As the voice of the people that live for ""The Daily Show"" and dreamed of Fitzmas, he's a great sandwich artist.</p><p>
    
    What makes these weak attempts at earnestness all the more disappointing is that the music is great.  Mudhoney are still in love with the three B's-- Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, and Big Muff-- but the group showers its loves with flattering arrangements and accoutrements.  The horns that popped up on Mudhoney's last record (<em>Since We've Become Translucent</em>) return to make tasteful cameos, most notably on the bookending tracks.  The band also mixes some straight-up blooze with its usual blooze-based sludge, via ""I Saw the Light"".  Which is, of course, a track about love like nuclear war.  The  use of xylophone on ""Endless Yesterday"" infuses the track with a sense of psychedelic paranoia brought to bear by Arm's approximation of corny turned-on wonderment.  On the flip side, when offered on ""In Search Of"", that same sort of ponderous <i>Nuggets</i>y corn fails to pop.</p><p>
    
    The strongest tracks mete their purported topicality with solid tunes.  The denouncement of day-to-day ennui ""Empty Shells"" would sound much worse than it already does if the music-- primo Mudhoney thud and chug-- didn't sound so great.  Even ""Where Is the Future"" sounds good, apart from the I Heart Heinlein bits.  But then there's ""Hard-On for War"", which starts off aping ""Play That Funky Music"" and goes straight into the depths you'd expect from a song about Dad getting some gash because all the young strapping lads are off spreading democracy with their blood and guts as the spread.  Granted, no one should expect Shakespeare or Dylan (even Diane Warren, really) from Mudhoney lyrics, but a song that begins with the lines, ""Can you hear the little girls asking/ Daddy where have all the little boys gone?"" has a tough task ahead of itself. And if you want to hear what happens when the album flops musically, try giving ""Oh the Move"" a listen.</p><p>
    
    The one track from this disjointed and ultimately disappointing album that I, Helping Friendly Pitchfork Writer, can give an unequivocal thumbs-up is a two-minute sortie near the latter part of the album that hits it, quits it, and doesn't fuss about any worldly concerns. Of course, it's an instrumental. And, of course, it's called ""A Brief Celebration of  Indifference"". If only this celebration lasted for 40 more minutes.</p></div>"|5495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5495-under-a-billion-suns/|6.1|David Raposa

As smoky melodies form from the curling, resonant notes, Heidi ""White Diamond"" Diehl's theatrical vocals declare, ""Peace is a phoenix right out of the sky.""  Each word, delivered with Diehl's unique character and emphasis, drops like a pin through the mist of separated notes, pulling them together into a melee of skeletal structures.</p><p>
<em>Gipsy Freedom</em> is mostly configured from mosaics of folk-influenced guitar and a series of other less distinct instruments.  But like all of WWVV's recordings to date-- the group shares the present noise/experimental scene's dedication to prolificacy, having produced a striking number of cassettes and CDRs in addition to their more widely available releases-- <em>Gipsy Freedom</em> departs from the band's previous work.  The acoustic loveliness of <i>The Flood</i>, for example, is less articulated; instead, the band takes strides toward broken and fractured jazz, which frees them to experiment with a broader range of space and sound.</p><p>
    
    An instrumental wash of bass and flute provides the foundation for improv track ""Hey Pig He Stole My Sound""; it's quickly embellished with the rickety twinkle of bells and clattering cymbals.  ""Don't Love the Liar"", perhaps the most traditionally structure song here, forms around a bony kickdrum and prowling bassline.  Perhaps best serving as an example of what Wooden Wand choose <em>not to do on this album, the track flickers out less than two minutes in.  Of course, there's also ample evidence of the band's strong roots in noise music (original member Tovah O'Rourke comprises half of Dead Machines with husband John Olsen of Wolf Eyes): ""Dead End Days with Caesar"", though not of Prurient/Wolf Eyes school of ear-splitting torture, is a 20-odd-minute avant-garde jamboree, thick with jaunty rhythms and contact mic explosions.</em></p><p>
    
    Wooden Wand &amp; the Vanishing Voice have managed to maintain a delightful sense of mystery thus far: From their website's far-flung but not entirely convincing biography (apparently, their history embraces Czech runaways, traveling carnivals, and childhood literary prodigies) to their quasi-mythical stage names (Satya Sai Kali Jehovah, Glucas Nonhorse Crane, etc.), the band clearly enjoys building their mystique, thriving in an ambiguous, hypnotic make-believe world.  But here they've finally broken the essential barrier that many of their noise-dabbling Brooklynite peers have yet to penetrate: <i>Gipsy Freedom</i> is the first release on which the group's music is as fascinating, enigmatic, and multifaceted as their shadowy personas.</p></div>"|8799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8799-gipsy-freedom/|8.4|Mia Lily Clarke

Finding himself with no label, he simply pressed a few hundred copies onto vinyl and sold them at local record stores. For his new album, <em>Below the Branches</em>, he had some help, not just the guest musicians who play on these songs, but also an interested record label, namely Sub Pop. So it seems particularly odd that for all the time and sweat Stoltz has put into this music, there's no sense of a real person behind these songs, just a tightly wound bundle of ideas borrowed from likely pop sources.</p><p>
    
    ""Ever Thought of Coming Back"" begins with Beach Boys harmonies that are almost litigiously similar to ""Don't Worry Baby"", ""Memory Collector"" relies on idyllic recollections much like those on <em>The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</em>, and ""Wave Goodbye"" and ""Birdies Singing"" capture some of the goofier aspects of the Beatles. On the other hand, far too many songs evoke solo Lennon, solo McCartney, and solo Harrison (unsurprisingly, I don't detect very much solo Starr). These aren't exactly adventurous touchstones, and <em>Below the Branches</em> comes off as too reverent and polite, as if <em>Pet Sounds</em> and <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> are holy texts. But the popular canon he plugs into never feels very personal to Stoltz; something unexpected might have broken this impersonal spell-- perhaps some of the New Wave he channeled on his song-for-song cover album of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's <em>Crocodiles</em>, for example.</p><p>
    
    ""Find a thing that makes you happy,"" Stoltz sings on ""Wave Goodbye"". ""Find a thing that gets you high."" <em>Below the Branches</em> shows he's found his thing. The care with which he's fashioned and recorded these songs is as obvious as the influences, and while affectionate perfectionism doesn't guarantee listenability (in fact, it often precludes it), in this case craft is the album's saving grace. Stoltz's attention to sonic detail ensures the choruses are catchy when they're supposed to be catchy, the tempos jaunty when they're supposed to be jaunty, the mood dark or sunny whenever it's supposed to be either dark or sunny. The keyboard fanfare that kicks off ""Summer's Easy Feeling"" quickly and neatly transforms into a contemplative motif as the tempo picks up. ""Memory Collector"" has what sounds like an impromptu mouth trumpet solo, and ""Words"" descends on a meditative keyboard crawl that creates a curiouser and curiouser mood. Alas, nothing much comes of it before song's end.</p><p>
    
    But don't read that hollowness the wrong way. Stoltz is a pop universalist, and on <em>Below the Branches</em>, he seems willing to absent himself so that the listener can become the focus, so the music can speak for whomever hears it instead of whomever makes it. I'm not sure this approach works as well as it could-- emptiness is emptiness, regardless of its intentions-- but <em>Below the Branches</em> seems nevertheless genuinely and generously deferential, a tip of the hat to whomever's on the other end of the artist/audience equation. The caveat is that listeners may never hear nearly as much in these songs as Stoltz does.</p></div>"|7522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7522-below-the-branches/|6.3|Stephen M. Deusner

    smoked weed and followed Phish and played in those drum circles everyone 
    hates. One spiritual breakthrough later, he realized he loved dancehall 
    reggae and Judaism (order unclear) and started making music. He performs 
    wearing traditional Hasidic garb, and he beatboxes and stagedives. That's the whole 
    story. Stop reading those magazine articles.</p><p>
    His music, however, isn't all that special. Mixing high school retreat Rasta 
    spitting, Yiddish verse, and occasionally legit patois over a synthesized 
    version of trad reggae, he's on that old search for enlightenment and 
    devotion but his struggle reeks of bored rich 
    kid. Foolish to question his faith, but in the face of Bob Marley's homeland 
    righteousness and complicated politics or Sizzla's maniacal, militant 
    Rastafarianism, Matisyahu's roots reggae is flimsy stuff. Not necessary 
    novelty. Just not that novel.</p><p>
    Matisyahu's third album is his first studio release since last year's 
    rep-making SXSW performance and comes on the heels of a live album, <em>Live at Stubb's</em>, that currently resides in the Billboard top 50. The LP is overrun with standard religious tropes. 
    <em>Youth</em> was produced by Material linchpin Bill Laswell, who issued Trojan's <em>Dub Massive 
    Chapters One &amp; Two</em> last year and has helped produce avant-garde music for 
    the likes of John Zorn, Laurie Anderson, and Herbie Hancock (he played bass 
    on ""Rockit""). His contributions are obvious on ""Indestructible"" and ""Late 
    Night in Zion"", tracks that glide away from traditional Jamrock stomp and 
    dabble in bouncy ethereal movements and wanky soloing. Lyrically, Godspeak 
    is unassailable stuff (ask Sufjan) but Matisyahu is not immune to clunky 
    turns of phrase like, ""What I'm fighting for is more than silver and gold"" or 
    ""I'm all shook up like I been in the blender,"" and is often downed by them. 
    ""Unique in My Dove"" is admirable stuff, pleading and pledging fidelity to 
    his woman, and extrapolated to his faith. But it's treacle jammy stuff; with 
    all those natty drum fills, MOR progressions, and lockstep dub grooves the 
    good will goes to shit.</p><p>
    Authenticity and showmanship appear to be the stumbling blocks and great 
    emancipators for Matisyahu. Inexplicably, he attracts 
    jam-rock blaggards and disoriented hipsters with nowhere else to turn with 
    his wacky ability to make beat noises out of his mouth. It was annoying when Justin Timberlake did it and it's annoying now. Still, as large venues continue to 
    sell out, Baby Boomers remember they luuuhve Marley and hey, this guy, at 
    least, kinda sounds like him if you can't remember the 70s that well. Plus he's worth an extra 20 minutes of convos 
    at the steak house before the show. ""Wait, he's Jewish? You're kidding!?!"" 
    It's sad that relatively innocuous musicians are indicted on the strength of their audience, but 
    sometimes the demographics don't lie.</p><p>
    In his 2005 end-of-the-year comments, Pitchfork's boss hog Ryan Schreiber 
    dissed Matis simply by quoting the Bravery's Sam Enidcott's ill-considered 
    declaration that ""This is the future of music."" Others have also hopped on 
    this dubious idea. I'm not entirely sure anyone knows what Endicott's 
    statement means. I suspect the next Hasidic dude rocking the mic is gonna 
    get shouted down for being a poseur. Perhaps Endicott meant that artists who 
    step out of their cultural realm and embrace an unlikely sound to deliver 
    their message are the future. There might be something to that.</p></div>"|5661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5661-youth/|4.9|Sean Fennessey

It's a page-turner of borough teens in tight jeans, shells, Clydes, and Cazals, rocking boomboxes and beltbuckle nameplates. Not much has changed then, other than pervasive crack-rhetoric in raps and, of course, all the crack, which itself cuts trends, shunts history, and supplies the nostalgic weight to back-in-the-day comps like <em>Big Apple Rappin'</em>, a stack of some of hip-hop's earliest pressings. But the songs here are more than rose-tinted artifacts. While they do convey the blitheness before ""The Message"", they also dispel myths about hip-hop's natal innocence, naivet, and homogeneity. Most importantly though, for songs built specifically not-to-last, some still sound pretty fresh.</p><p>
    Not all timeless, some are what they are, seven-minute one-take prattling over interpolated disco r&amp;b; (sounds cooler than it is) recorded to fill one side of a 12"". Most tedious of these are the title track by Spyder D, clocking in at 10-plus minutes of repping every block and crew in NYC (Ashford &amp; Simpson?), and Nice and Nasty 3's ""The Ultimate Rap"", which at nine minutes tests the patience for Cheryl Lynn. Not to take anything away from their place in history, but they are museum pieces. Less dusty is Masterdon &amp; The Def Committee's ""Funkbox Party"", which features a classic 808 under the fast-raps of Gangster Gee and the original hard-spitting female, Pebblee Poo, who'd already spent time in Kool Herc's Herculoids. But the selections aging best are the ones that were idiosyncratic from the jump. Spoonie Gee's ""Spoonin' Rap"" is a nine-minute echoplexed rant that starts with copping feelings on girls to catching feelings from dudes in prison. There's a lesson there. The ladies are more than objects here, though, as Xanadu supply Debbie Harry with a style, and Universal 2 are proto-Salt-N-Pepa. Conscious-rap is covered by Brother D &amp; the Collective Effort, and the Fly Guys' high-on-life whisper song, which relies on a knocking milk bottle. Connecting the dots between the Bronx and Kingston are General Echo's ""Rapping Dub Style"", lazing horns and diddly-dees included, and the Jamaica Girls' ""Rock The Beat"", non-rapped but like-minded.</p><p>
    So on a compilation of hip-hop's dawn, you've got live bands, drum machines, politics, nonsense, misogyny, homophobia, and partying, all set to dance music, some of it stolen wholesale from its origins. Just saying. Regardless, Soul Jazz once again give us clear versions of rare gems and essentials, packaged with loads of interviews, photos and old show flyers, courtesy the relentless research of Johan ""Google Me"" Kugleberg. Not just for old folks, <i>Big Apple Rappin' still manages to party fairly hard, although it probably shouldn't have tried to get into those Jordaches.</i></p></div>"|1998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1998-big-apple-rappin/|7.0|Peter Macia

This biographical nugget sounds like press-release fodder, but it becomes more significant when you hear the first couple of songs on his second album, <em>bluefolk</em>: Opener ""Smile"" and the menacing ""Bread"" are pitch-dark and subterranean, with rough melodies pickaxed from rock and cacophonous instruments that coalesce into mine-rail beats. ""Danger lurks like a breaking limb,"" he warns on ""Vivid""; death isn't just ever present, but a driving force.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, Jones finds inspiration in Biblical foreboding, keeping one foot in Genesis and the other in the Book of Revelation, caught between original sin and the end of the world. ""Can you hear the horses galloping on?"" he asks repeatedly on ""Hey Love"". On ""Bread""-- ostensibly an antiwar song based on Jones' own thwarted draft during the Vietnam War-- he carries on a conversation with a frantic Abraham, who's searching for his lost son, ""the almost-murdered one."" Instead of sounding obvious or outrageous, the exchange sounds perfectly apt within Jones' apocalyptic mountain music. But it's the music on <em>bluefolk</em> and Jones' vocal performance that gives these songs their simultaneously claustrophobic and mesmeric power. The rumble of instruments that begins ""Smile"" sets the tone, and the martial programmed beat on ""Bread"" pushes the other instruments militaristically as Patty Griffin's backing vocals offset Jones' gruffer voice. On ""Vivid"" he runs his words together until they lose their mean and become pure sound: ""vividis vividisvividdoes."" The motion of those syllables becomes curiously unsettling.</p><p>
    
    On an album like <em>bluefolk</em>, where everything sounds submerged in shadows, light is only a relative term, but the songs' progress is a kind of resurfacing, with Jones climbing out of his dark pit and back onto the surface of the earth. The songs grow less and less opaque as he makes naked declarations of conflicted love, as on ""Evermore"": ""I miss you I want you I lay you beside you I reach for you dubiously."" The wall of sound that confined earlier songs crumbles as the lyrics and instruments separate, the tempos slacken, and the melodies soften, culminating with the spare and strangely moving ""Freedom"", constructed around a clip from a Martin Luther King Jr. speech. In other hands, this type of finale might have been fatally transparent, drawing a too-straight line from 60s revolution to 90s complacency. But Jones wisely keeps his intentions mysterious and personal, which prevents the album's second half from being a letdown after the more intense first half. Continuing in the vein of those early songs would have produced a smothering album, so Jones lets a little light in, if only to show how dark the world can be.</p></div>"|4367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4367-bluefolk/|7.9|Stephen M.

Now joined by multi-instrumentalist Doug McDiarmid, guitarist Matt Meldon, and Wolf's drummer
    brother Josiah, the group continue to explore the fuller, broader compositions first heard on last year's <em>Sanddollars</em> EP.</p><p>
    The title track, ""Rubber Traits"", is lifted from Why?'s third album, <em>Elephant Eyelash</em>. It's a salient example of how the group have developed over the past year or so: heavily Pavement-influenced melodies and late 60s vocal riffs integrate with Wolf's faux-naïve humor and that definitive ""feelin' good"" West Coast sound. Many of his lyrics reference the Bay Area in favorable and colorfully descriptive ways, and it's unsurprising that, as an Ohio native, Wolf seems to
    relish in the city that provided a platform for his musical endeavors and
    community.</p><p>
    ""Rubber Traits"" builds around a selection of Wolf's surreal observations,
    ranging from the romantically odd (""I want to kiss like taffy, and hump gentle on a bed of nails"") to the macabre: (""and watch a fly hit a pane of glass until he gets real bony and his stomach swells up and he dies""). As a whole, the lyrics flow through the music like curiously nonsensical daydreams, but their slightly sinister edge infects the mass of major chords and prevents them from sounding too sugary. On the EP's three previously unreleased tracks, Why? flourish as a band. The guitars are delicately jangly, and McDiarmid's piano chords embellish songs like ""Pick Fights"" to strikingly simple effect, intersecting Wolf as he reflects on his Ohio days. (""The best place to pick a fight is in the Midwest..."").</p><p>
    Although Why? has always been one of the more accessible, pop-oriented artists on anticon, Wolf really shines when he drops the happy-go-lucky tonal gloss in exchange for darker lyrics and beats. ""Deceived"", the final track on <em>Rubber Traits</em>, delivers a low tone monologue cut over steady, atmospheric rhythms that recalls the introspective, fluid rapping of fellow anticon associate Buck 65. Including this sharp-witted excerpt on <em>Rubber Traits</em> show how multi-faceted Wolf's music can be, while drawing tighter comparisons to his involvement with side projects cLOUDDEAD and Hymie's Basement.</p><p>
    Appended to the audio disc is filmmaker Ravi Zupa's wonderfully creepy video for ""Rubber Traits"". Going along with the Californian, off-key psychedelic vibe perpetuated by Why?, Zupa uses headache-inducing colors and flurries of flower icons to decorate his bizarre, and often very funny, pastiches. These are mostly set around his collages of dog photographs in which the canine snouts are replaced by the moving mouths of the band members. The mustached spaniel-- which looks worryingly like Frank Zappa-- is very effective during the Beach Boys ""oooh wee oooh"" chorus, though the icing on the cake has to be when Wolf juggles grapefruits in a bath shared by a rather shocked and toothy pug.</p></div>"|8673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8673-rubber-traits-ep/|6.8|Mia Lily Clarke

    juicy Dim Mak Records rumor a few years back was that Devon Aoki, Dim
    Mak label founder Steve Aoki's sister, was not just a fashion model
    but either a current or former Jay-Z paramour. Who knows the
    un-internet-varnished truth, but Dim Mak's web page currently opens to
    pictures of Devon modeling with Dim Mak merchandise, and the big news
    on site seems to be that the label will premiere an actual fashion
    line or two come May. Punk stylization comes as nothing new-- Souls
    She Said guitarist Don Devore played in Ink &amp; Dagger, a band that
    invented a genre they called ""vampire rock,"" equal parts corpse paint,
    antagonism, and stylized hardcore that was more gesture than
    orientation-- but the Dim Mak dudes, on anyone's message board, are
    really elevating their fashion game.</p><p>
    
    Souls She Said are made up of Don Devore and Joe Cardamone, both of
    whom also play in the L.A.-based Icarus Line; on the Dim
    Mak website, the newest Icarus Line video is posted, and it largely
    consists of naked girls and guys rubbing pierced, normally concealed
    body parts against one another. Again, without guessing who's naked
    or why, this is all a lot of rock that doesn't look like your
    punk-rock older brother's flannels or button-downs.</p><p>
    
    With trepidation then, I looked for clues, but extra-musically, there
    were few. Souls She Said have yet to show their aesthetic hand: The
    record artwork plays anagram games with the band name; there's some
    ambiguous pink and orange sketching; middle fingers sit underneath the
    CD tray. Song titles give away their priorities only slightly more:
    ""Tastefaker"", ""Floor on the Floor"", or ""Cause, I Can't Find a Place in
    Hell"" grate a little, but it's not like they have a song called ""AIDS
    Wolf"" or anything.</p><p>
    
    Crack the record and learn a little more. ""Floor on the Floor"" is
    standard indie fake-sex warm-up stuff, spitting nonsense dance
    commands and 2001 Brooklyn hip-shaking bile to the tune of ""I smoke a
    lot/ That shit is hot,"" and worse, ""Everybody on the floor/ Everybody
    get on the floor."" This is a stylization we know, and even in my Brooklyn 11222, sassed
    falsetto, guitar swagger, and funky breaks on the snare seem all form
    and nothing formative. ""Tastefaker"" has something to do with a
    Rapture or two, punctuating 2s and 4s with little hip-thrusted
    guitar flourishes; although Souls She Said also slow it down to points
    where the song might in fact be difficult to dance to, an iPod DJ is
    even now fitting ""Tastefaker"" onto his Thursday night playlist.</p><p>
    
    ""Sunken City"" and ""Riverbloat"" present an older look, telling sonic
    tales of New Order over four note descending nostalgia drops, some
    funky MIDI, and little modernizing bass flourishes or jarring guitars
    that nod to labelmates Bloc Party. Cardamone's vocal wail here is
    halfway between Bono and Bernard Sumner, with a little Stephen Malkmus
    thrown in (in particular, on ""Distralia"", a vocal dead ringer), an
    effect aided by Devore's occasional Pavement non-licks riffs and the
    fuzz they every once in a while douse the vocals with. Whether it all
    adds up to pseudo-side project pastiche, shiny runway fashion skronk,
    rock-to-get-chicks, or a heartfelt though derivative swing for the
    post-post-punk fence, only future releases or clothes collections
    will tell. One thing I do know: Unless they find some folks with ears
    more virgin than mine, nobody's going home with them yet. Maybe with a
    newer look...</p></div>"|7847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7847-as-templar-nites/|5.4|Zach Baron

    furtive marker of recognition among like-minded obsessives, Belle and
    Sebastian have increasingly attracted casual listeners. Recent
    full-length <em>The Life Pursuit</em> completed the break with the
    band's outsiders-as-insiders origins, becoming their first album to reach the UK top 10. With
    the latest installment in the <em>LateNightTales</em> compilation
    series, previously curated by the Flaming Lips and Four Tet, the
    Scottish group poses an inevitable cred-salvaging question: But have
    you seen their records?</p><p>
    Oh, sure, they've got it all: funk, jazz, soul, hip-hop, lounge,
    tropicalia, IDM, Afropop, classical, classic rock,
    reggae, country reggae, reggae funk (but not reggaeton), and a hazy
    spoken-word piece by comedian David Shrigley in which an old woman
    dishes about her husband's ""apparatus."" It's never clear which
    specific band member chooses each track. No matter: Stuart Murdoch &amp;
    Co. throw down the pop archivist's gauntlet impressively, though it
    often feels they're trying too hard to impress.</p><p>
    Like the recent Rough Trade <em>Counter Culture</em> comp, the disc is
    too varied for many one-sitting listens, but as a crate-digging
    exercise it yields a few directions for further exploration. The
    plaintive vocals of Greek troubadour Demis Roussos on his sparse 1972
    ballad ""O My Friends You've Been Untrue To Me"" should appeal to Antony
    and the Johnsons fans. California soul singer Mary Love's uptempo
    mid-1960s also-ran ""I'm in Your Hands"" has the energetic appeal of the
    best Motown. Gal Costa's Caetano Velosi-penned 1969 ""Lost in the
    Paradise"" is swooning, horn-drenched bossa nova, while Ramsey Lewis's
    funky jazz entry from the same year, ""Uhuru"", features Earth, Wind &amp;
    Fire founder Maurice White on kalimba. Erick and Mondrek Muchena add a
    taste of Zimbabwe amid the dusty rhythms of ""Taireva"". To be fair, Tom
    Middleton already picked the Peddlers' sub-Sinatra crooner ""On a Clear
    Day You Can See Forever"" for another compilation series, Family's
    <em>The Trip</em>, but this song remains the only good argument for a
    new Austin Powers sequel.</p><p>
    Other tracks fall deeper into novelty territory. Elsie Mae and the
    barrel-voiced Walter Jackson each turn in powerful performances, but
    their material-- a tepid ""Rescue Me"" knock-off and an overwrought soul
    weeper, respectively-- explains their lack of wider fame. It's hard to
    say what Belle &amp; Sebastian were thinking when they mashed up Johnny
    Cash's mariachi-laced ""Ring of Fire"" with the West Kingston skank of
    the Ethiopians' ""Freeman"", but Butch Cassidy Sound System's ""Cissy
    Strut"" works with the classic Meters tune.</p><p>
    Where the compilation intermittently succeeds is in building a foggy,
    buzzed late-night atmosphere, true to its title. Rehash's opening
    ""Gratuitous Theft in the Rain"" sets the scene with David Axelrod-like
    loops, bringing to mind Rjd2, whose heartbreaking
    <em>Deadringer</em> hidden track and single ""Here's What's Left"" also appears. Madlib's Lootpack offers the slinky ""Questions"". A dancefloor
    rendering of the Stylistics' ""People Make The World Go Round"" by
    Paperclip People, aka Carl Craig, achieves a futuristic Herbertian
    sheen that almost transcends its smooth-jazz sax. Contrast that with
    Novi Singers' Polish-language vocal jazz. The electronic textures of
    Múm's ""Green Grass of Tunnel"" and Space Jam's 1998 12-inch ""Let Your
    Conscience Be Your Guidance"" prove even more immersive.</p><p>
    No worries, a few tracks also conjure the band's own sound. On ""Get
    Thy Bearings"", from 1968's <em>Hurdy Gurdy Man</em>, unlikely
    indie-yuppie precursor Donovan floats his fey, Murdoch-like vocals
    atop jazzy instrumentals fit for <em>Astral Weeks</em>, which was
    released the same year. Big Star's ""Watch the Sunrise"", from 1972's <em>#1 Record</em> shares
    the gawky acoustic glow of ""Mayfly"" or ""I Don't Love Anyone"". Stereolab melds ""Eleanor Rigby"" strings and
    joyously fuzzy guitars on 1993 touchstone ""French Disko"". Steve Miller Band's ""Fly Like an Eagle"" sounds kinda like how haters
    described <em>The Life Pursuit</em>, except this time it really is
    flatulent mid-70s astro-blooz, which no amount of so-unhip-it's-hip
    trend-speculating (BTW sooo unhip) can salvage.</p><p>
    So it goes: Eclecticism and obscurantism provide the tale of the tape
    in record-collector apparatus-measuring contests. By this standard,
    Belle &amp; Sebastian's <em>LateNightTales</em> is a prodigious success.
    The band's lone recording here, a breezy, overlookable cover of
    ""Casaco Marron"" by Evinha-- a member of Brazilian a cappella group
    Trio Esperanca-- seals the victory, pyrrhic as Plutarch. Belle
    and Sebastian's fan culture may have always encouraged vinyl
    fetishism, but the misplaced machismo in this nugget-flaunting display
    seems gauche given the delicate wit of the band's original
    compositions. Dudes, you're not losing your edge.</p></div>"|640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/640-latenighttales/|6.8|Marc Hogan

The first is the band's name. I'm wary whenever I see such a pointedly bucolic name attached to an indie label, as young sophisticates appropriating earnest backwater idioms tend to be boring at best and terrible at worst. My suspicion that Catfish Haven was a condescending indie-country band or ironic roots rock revival seemed to be borne out by red flag number two, frontman George Hunter's hoarse album-opening declaration: ""We're Catfish Haven and this is what we do!"" What, recycle old tropes of workmanlike humility without the hard-earned lived experience to justify them?</p><p> 
    Turns out I was wrong on both counts, and by the end of the title track, those red warning flags had both been bleached surrender-white. Catfish Haven scan as a bar band-- what with Hunter's smoky-throated moans and the lucid, feel-good quality of the music-- but there is no irony here. Nothing in the hooky melodies is purposefully obscured, and there's no sense of winking amusement at playing rootsy bar rock in a post-rock musical climate. It's the EP's open quality-- the songs are simple and everything happens right before your eyes-- that retroactively recasts Hunter's introductory invocation of sincere bar bands past as a self-effacing extension of his unflashy yet satisfying music.</p><p> 
    On the title track's searing rave-up, staccato emotive bursts get swept up in a tide of concisely pounding percussion and stately rhythm guitar. Projecting from the diaphragm without overselling the memorable melody, Hunter's voice can crank up like a lawnmower or suddenly dip into bluesy melancholy with equal facility, and on this track in particular he belts like Van Morrison at his amped-up best. But this isn't his only register. On the smoldering dirge ""Crying Shame"", Hunter trades his exuberance for a sinister theatricality á la Nick Cave, dragging the last word of each line over infernal embers. Both styles find purchase on ""Madelin"", as whining string bends and a diabolically distressed ""whoa"" suddenly let out into winsome, clattering rock. Take away quirky instrumentation, genre experiments, and yelping vocals; what's left in the modern guitar band's arsenal? Catfish Haven remind us: Tuneful, passionate singing, lucid songwriting, and engaging riffs.</p></div>"|1828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1828-please-come-back-ep/|7.6|Brian Howe

The hirsute Roots drummer is a world-class DJ, known for seamless sets, and a well-known musical connoisseur with an overwhelming collection of records. <em>Babies Makin' Babies 2: Misery Strikes Back...No More Babies</em>, like its predecessor, confirms ?uest's credentials. But let's be clear: The first one is a good if somewhat basic get-the-drawz mix; this more complex installment, which effortlessly moves from seeming sad to sounding sweet, is even better.</p><p>
    A nod to the lovelorn, <em>Babies</em> has its share of blue tunes, like ""Our Love Has Died"", which wallows in self-pity, as Ohio Players' Leroy ""Sugarfoot"" Bonner grieves a failed affair: ""They buried our love, six feet down/ No mourners, no mourners came around."" His cheerless drawl, set to dirge-like drums, then morphs to full-blown sulk-fest. ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"", which sports a lush guitar, is willfully glum. Al Green is asking that which-- judging by his grief-- is unanswerable; the song's title may as well be ""How Can You Squeeze Blood From a Stone"".</p><p> 
    Thankfully, ?uest also includes songs that tell the female side of the story. Syreeta's ""Cause We've Ended Now as Lovers"" is brooding but big-hearted. The Stevie Wonder protégé ponders lost innocence over acoustic soul strumming: ""Lovers walking in the rain/ So close, we feel each other's pain/ But now, you say that love has died away."" None of the standard reproof (which inflames her male contemporaries) is heard in her quiet contralto. On the other hand, Betty Davis' ""Anti Love Song"" seethes with righteous wrath, proving it takes two to tango.</p><p> 
    While <em>Babies</em> feels complete, it still misses some essentials-- Marvin Gaye's ""When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You"" would have worked well here; ""Jessica"", by Herbie Hancock, also comes to mind. Then again, those songs are likely too bleak for <em>Babies</em>, whose most melancholic tracks (""Our Love Has Died"", ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"") are not as dismal; both songs are sweetened by immaculate production. Likewise, Natalie Cole's ""Good Morning Heartache"" has a technicolor, variety-show grandness that invalidates its woe. At any rate, ?uest achieves a rare combination: a sonic pity party with a soul-soothing sheen.</p></div>"|6630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6630-babies-makin-babies-2-misery-strikes-backno-more-babies/|7.1|Will Dukes

That movie and soundtrack were stillbirths-- angst-doses for kids who'd already been getting them on screen and stereo for six or seven years-- and even my young self sensed something slacker was dying. New Radiant Storm King's <i>The Steady Hand </i> arrives then as a super-oddity: call it spirit of spiritless '97, or <i>SubUrbia</i> soundtrack redux. Their ""Accountant of the Year"" is Girls Against Boys' ""Bulletproof Cupid""; ""Fighting off the Pricks"" is Superchunk's ""Does Your Hometown Care?""; ""Yardsale Legacy"" gets to be Sonic Youth's ""Sunday"" of course; even ""From a Roof"" could be the Butthole Surfers' ""Human Cannonball"".</p><p>
     
    That that kind of major-labelled indie rock was already choking itself to death circa <i>then</i>-- same for the last vestiges of anything called ""college rock."" Regardless, New Radiant Storm King's website still reads as elegy for Nirvana magic-markered flyers and Homestead Records. We learn about gigs with Sebadoh and GBV, sleeping over at the Unwound house, and they even offer up a depressing late vestige of the Year-Punk-Broke contract boom: either a very large or very small $45,000 from Grass records, a former Dutch East India subsidiary. It gets worse. Try a '97 tour with ""it's good to be the king""-era Creed, then shelved contracts, unreturned phone calls, and inevitable indie oblivion.</p><p>
     
    I did college radio in Massachusetts, which meant I was knee-deep in NRSK detritus. They had splits with Silver Jews, Polvo, GBV; everyone who followed '90s rock ended up with at least a compilation song; like most people I played the flip of those records, or other songs off the comps, but they were old familiars. Who knew they still breathed?</p><p>
     
    But also, why? Their buzz is now commonly spun as ""near miss,"" but that's just B-list fate. My friend Joshua had a high school (circa 1993) fling with <i>Rival Time</i>'s ""Phonecall"", a college love-letter/acid-in-the-woods slacker paean to a girl with ""brand new glasses."" Stack that against <i>The Steady Hand</i>'s 2006 pseudo-social commentary ""Accountant of the Year"": ""I think I'll go in early today/ I think I'll catch an earlier train/ I'm going to make my quota today."" I'll take the girl, thanks guys, and not just because my grandfather was an accountant.</p><p>
     
    Ditto on the minefield truisms of ""Fighting off the Pricks"": emo-by-numbers ""every atom of my being beckons me to keep on staying here,"" complete with falsetto chorus, and sweeping dual guitars (one vaguely jangling lead, the other the epic rhythm). College crushes are cute but at least a couple of these dudes ought to married by now, no?</p><p>
     
    We should root for the underdog though, and unreconstructed '93 indie is definitely that. Their rallying cry, for a guy looking pretty hard for one, wasn't too hard to find on <i>The Steady Hand</i>. ""Anthymn"", a vaguely Foo Fighters rip, has the fist-pump chorus and the low-dynamic bridge to charm you back, or make you still believe in shiny happy half-rock. Until, that is, you realize what you're shouting along to: ""Reckonings of who you should have been/ Are by comparison/ Sure of who you were 10 years ago/ Where does a decade go?""</p></div>"|5776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5776-the-steady-hand/|4.8|Zach Baron

Given      that most indie rock seems predicated upon being either deeply fucked up      (see: Xiu Xiu, Smog, Shellac), or pretty-darned-nice (see: everyone      else), there isn't much room to be...just kind of a jerk. If, as my      friend Raf has suggested, bands like the Jesus Lizard, Big Black, and      Brainiac make up a de facto subgenre of ""evil indie rock,"" Mclusky could      be best be classified as ""asshole indie rock""-- direct, obnoxious, and      unapologetic. On this 3xCD retrospective, the now-defunct Welsh trio      offers up an excellent CD of the band's singles and two discs of subpar B-sides and      rarities and live tracks, cramming together the band's very best and very worst material      into one awkward and probably excessive package.</p>
<p>Disc one features most of Mclusky's best songs; because it's a singles collection, a few of the necessarily omitted album tracks are missed, but there are zero duds. The formula here is      straightforward and self-evident: crunchy guitars, booming drums, fuzzed      out bass, and Andy Falkous's curiously expressive sing-scream. Given the      relative consistency of Mclusky's sound, the strength of these      particular songs comes down to hooks. At their best, Mclusky can      turn something as simple as a tuneless two-syllable utterance into a      song-carrying hook. In a nuts-and-bolts way, it's a skillful and      economical manipulation of rhythm and momentum, but the x-factor is      attitude. Like the douchebag at the bar whose obnoxious      antics you secretly cherish, the giddy, petty belligerence conjured by      Mclusky is infectious.</p>
<p>A few of the better songs from the band's rough-and-tumble debut <i>My      Pain and Sadness Is More Sad and Painful Than Yours</i> get the A-sides      disc off to a promising start, but things really pick up with the selections from Mclusky's finest album, <i>Mclusky Do Dallas</i>.      ""Whoyouknow"", ""Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues"", ""To Hell With Good      Intentions"", and ""Alan Is a Cowboy Killer,"" are taut, merciless, and      concise, perfectly captured by Steve Albini's similarly taut, merciless,      and concise production. The non-album single ""There Ain't No Fool in      Ferguson"" is my favorite here, coupling a television commercial-catchy      guitar line with playful alliteration to the tune of ""hopeless hepatitis      piss-rag Molotov cocktail mono-brow shithole.""</p>
<p>And then there are the other discs. Compilations like this are always a      no-win situation: If the B-sides eclipse the A-sides, then the band      clearly has no idea how to gauge their own material, and effectively      sold short their own career. If the B-sides fall substantially short of      the A-sides, then compiling them is potentially unnecessary. In this case, the B-sides sound like much shittier versions of the      A-sides. So, at the very least, Mclusky should be commended for putting      their best foot forward. Surprisingly, the third disc of rarities and live performances-- so-called      ""C-sides""-- proves more rewarding than its alphanumeric predecessor,      showing a more versatile and unchecked side of the band.</p>
<p>As is usually the case with these things, the three-disc version of      <i>Mcluskyism</i> works better as an archive than it does a unified listening      experience. Diehards, I'm sure, would love to include a choice ""C-side""      like ""Colour March"" or ""Cradling"" on a mix CD, but most people will find      the condensed version of <i>Mcluskyism</i> to be just right.

Given      that most indie rock seems predicated upon being either deeply fucked up      (see: Xiu Xiu, Smog, Shellac), or pretty-darned-nice (see: everyone      else), there isn't much room to be...just kind of a jerk. If, as my      friend Raf has suggested, bands like the Jesus Lizard, Big Black, and      Brainiac make up a de facto subgenre of ""evil indie rock,"" Mclusky could      be best be classified as ""asshole indie rock""-- direct, obnoxious, and      unapologetic. On this 3xCD retrospective, the now-defunct Welsh trio      offers up an excellent CD of the band's singles and two discs of subpar B-sides and      rarities and live tracks, cramming together the band's very best and very worst material      into one awkward and probably excessive package.</p>
<p>Disc one features most of Mclusky's best songs; because it's a singles collection, a few of the necessarily omitted album tracks are missed, but there are zero duds. The formula here is      straightforward and self-evident: crunchy guitars, booming drums, fuzzed      out bass, and Andy Falkous's curiously expressive sing-scream. Given the      relative consistency of Mclusky's sound, the strength of these      particular songs comes down to hooks. At their best, Mclusky can      turn something as simple as a tuneless two-syllable utterance into a      song-carrying hook. In a nuts-and-bolts way, it's a skillful and      economical manipulation of rhythm and momentum, but the x-factor is      attitude. Like the douchebag at the bar whose obnoxious      antics you secretly cherish, the giddy, petty belligerence conjured by      Mclusky is infectious.</p>
<p>A few of the better songs from the band's rough-and-tumble debut <i>My      Pain and Sadness Is More Sad and Painful Than Yours</i> get the A-sides      disc off to a promising start, but things really pick up with the selections from Mclusky's finest album, <i>Mclusky Do Dallas</i>.      ""Whoyouknow"", ""Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues"", ""To Hell With Good      Intentions"", and ""Alan Is a Cowboy Killer,"" are taut, merciless, and      concise, perfectly captured by Steve Albini's similarly taut, merciless,      and concise production. The non-album single ""There Ain't No Fool in      Ferguson"" is my favorite here, coupling a television commercial-catchy      guitar line with playful alliteration to the tune of ""hopeless hepatitis      piss-rag Molotov cocktail mono-brow shithole.""</p>
<p>And then there are the other discs. Compilations like this are always a      no-win situation: If the B-sides eclipse the A-sides, then the band      clearly has no idea how to gauge their own material, and effectively      sold short their own career. If the B-sides fall substantially short of      the A-sides, then compiling them is potentially unnecessary. In this case, the B-sides sound like much shittier versions of the      A-sides. So, at the very least, Mclusky should be commended for putting      their best foot forward. Surprisingly, the third disc of rarities and live performances-- so-called      ""C-sides""-- proves more rewarding than its alphanumeric predecessor,      showing a more versatile and unchecked side of the band.</p>
<p>As is usually the case with these things, the three-disc version of      <i>Mcluskyism</i> works better as an archive than it does a unified listening      experience. Diehards, I'm sure, would love to include a choice ""C-side""      like ""Colour March"" or ""Cradling"" on a mix CD, but most people will find      the condensed version of <i>Mcluskyism</i> to be just right. At one disc,      it's a gleeful kick in the ribs. At three, it's a      slightly-harder-than-appropriate punch in the arm.</p></div>"|11777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11777-mcluskyism-mcluskyism-expanded-edition/|6.1|Matt LeMay

Unintentionally evoking a field-recorded nightmare chorus of wheezing felines, the image is grotesque and completely at odds with the label's aesthetic, which, over the course of this sampler, shapes up like this: Find affable white people with acoustic guitars, establish a continuum spanning quirky indie-folk (e.g. Half-Handed Cloud) and Borders-listening-station MOR folk (e.g. Denison Witmer), sprinkle with Judeo-Christian imagery and wind chimes. Repeat as necessary.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps since Asthmatic Kitty has a small roster of artists, <em>Mews Too</em> rounds out a smattering of new tracks from heavyweights like Sufjan Stevens and Danielson with back-catalog songs from like-minded artists only casually associated with the label. Asthmatic Kitty's not the most versatile imprint, and the 24 tracks herein divide neatly into five simple categories: <em>Sufjan</em> (one song); <em>Sounds Pretty Much Just Like Sujfan or His Female Equivalent</em> (12 songs); <em>Danielson</em> (one song); <em>Sounds an Awful Lot Like Danielson</em> (three songs); and <em>Amazingly Doesn't Sound Much Like Sufjan or Danielson</em>, clocking in at a respectable seven songs.</p><p> 
    
    So if you're into eclecticism or allergic to acoustic guitars and polite vocals, give this one a wide berth. But if you enjoy the comfort of well-worn idioms, there's plenty for you here. Sufjan checks in with his typical elegant reserve. Bogs Visionary Orchestra breaks the folky monotony with an old-timey country shuffle; Half-Handed Cloud does the same with loopy harmonies and giddy trombones; Bunky with stomping sax lines. Castanets offer a brief reworking of the ominous title track from <em>First Light's Freeze</em>. Danielson, Men of Old, and Matthew Haseltine get all twitchy and shambling. Barring these diversions, the overall tone is one of innocuous beauty, although there are a few jarring missteps. My Brightest Diamond, Sam Rosen, and Liz Janes misplace their melodies in overstated vocal flourishes, while Jai Agnish soft-focuses his into anonymity.</p><p> 
    
    And now the question burning in everyone's mind can no longer be held at bay: <em>How Christian is it?</em> Short answer: Besides one overt messianic sally from Royal City, hardly at all. I've publicly derided the persecution narrative surrounding the music with Christian themes marketed to secular audiences. Think being a Christian in 21st century America bestows outsider status? Try singing about Allah for perspective. But the erroneous assumptions with which I approached this compilation lead me to believe that maybe there's something to it. It's perfectly understandable that bands who dabble in Christianity with a measure of sophistication would want to distance themselves from ""Christian rock,"" one of the most crassly manufactured of genres. Trivial references to Christianity get blown out of proportion in the music press (he says coyly)-- a song that happens to mention a Buick Skylark isn't perceived as being ""about cars,"" but a song that mentions Jesus, even once, becomes ""about Jesus."" In the end, though, it's probably of little consequence, since the trendy kids that supposedly discriminate against the new folk's occasional Christian themes aren't a logical audience for it based on sonics alone-- it's for emo kids, adult-contemp mavens, other warm fuzzies. You can not sing about Jesus all day, but if you're wearing a cardigan and plucking a banjo, the kid in the DFA t-shirt is probably going to clown you anyway.</p></div>"|1849.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1849-mews-too-an-asthmatic-kitty-compilation/|6.0|Brian Howe

You might know him as the guitarist for the Meat Puppets, who, despite several albums and a storied past-- their beginnings with SST, their early 90s radio hit ""Backwater"", their disintegration and then rebirth with Curt at the helm in 2000-- are still most widely known for being dragged onstage and covered by Nirvana on the grunge band's <em>Unplugged</em> album and MTV appearance. Aside from just being a tasteful (and indebted) listener, Kurt Cobain had a sharp ear to hear the lurching rhythms and woozy, off-kilter harmonies on <em>Meat Puppets II</em> and realized those songs would translate beautifully in a quieter cast. Years later, Kirkwood isn't running from it: He's the last Puppet standing, and <em>Snow</em> is an austere acoustic record on which his country-rock influences finally take the front seat.</p><p>
    
    Still, a grown-up and cleaned-up Kirkwood remains a beautiful guitarist and an able songwriter. It's no surprise he approaches these influences with caution and tastefulness, just as he reconciled his virtuosity with the noisy punk-influenced style of his former band. Nor does he crowd the tune. A mandolin plucks busily behind the guileless melody of the title track, hinging on a pleasant, evocative turn of phrase in the chorus (""Just like snow settles on barbed wire""). Country-tinged pop like ""Beautiful Weapon"" and ""Box of Limes"" feature great relaxed harmonies from Kirkwood, while the electric guitars growl just beneath the acoustic strumming that dominates the album.</p><p> 
     
    The circular, almost baroque guitar figure and bucket bass on ""Gold"" nail that same high-altitude, low-oxygen feeling of the Puppets' spacier moments. The more straight-up country tracks like ""Movin' On"" or the closing ""Circles"" aren't among my favorites, though they benefit from Kirkwood's careful arranging. ""Here Comes Forever"" even welcomes the slowing of age by showing the influence of Shari Lewis in its lyrics (""This song is bound to wander on, on and on/ This song could never be too long, no stopping I'm guessing""). But this doesn't mean these songs can't take fascinating left turns with their sleeves still around their wrists. The circuitous square-dance melody of ""Light Bulb"" drops suddenly for spaced-out chords, distortion, and jazz trumpet. ""In Bone"" starts as a dirge with barely any accompaniment but Kirkwood's voice and (for once) minimal guitar, but the chorus has the album's fullest arrangement and, arguably, its finest moment.</p></div>"|4608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4608-snow/|7.2|Jason Crock

It was a chaotic mess, but it was charming in its way, not to mention insidiously catchy.</p><p>
    
    The follow-up, <em>Ackrill/Venning '91</em> doesn't exude the same amount of curio charm that elevated its predecessor. It has its moments of inspired lunacy, but at 10 songs in less than 19 minutes, it doesn't have time to get its hooks in you, and the misfires loom all the larger. When you have a song that lasts all of 1:36 and consists of nothing but a woman singing, ""I do not not not not not/ Like getting fucked over by my friends"" over a couple of pretty basic garage band beats, it begs for context, but as it is, ""Getting Fucked Over By Your Friends"" is just pretty annoying. And amateurish vocals can be great, but there's a definable line between unstudied and just horrendously off-key, which is what the singing on the over-distorted ""Avoid the Docks"" is.</p><p>
    
    It's not all bad, of course. At their best, Hank fit in pretty comfortably 
    between Swell Maps and the Go! Team. The prophetically titled ""Danes in 
    Peril!"" is a great opener, with a call-and-response between what sounds like a couple of cheerleaders and an old English wino over a sturdy acoustic guitar riff and New Wave drums. ""Lakeshore Report Diluted: Sources"" has a sort of mutant Northern Soul rhythm track and comes off like a Motown song after ten generations of enthusiastic in-breeding. Two slower songs are strangely ingratiating: ""Dark Country"" is a nice creepy crawler with some amusing spoken-word bits, a good bass part and simulated steel guitar, with the great refrain ""I dedicate this to all my dead friends,"" while ""He Forgot My Name"" overcomes its weird, childlike female vocals (not quite on pitch at any point) to create an oddly haunting atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    Even with these peaks, though, there's a sense when the album comes to a 
    close with the pinched fuzz-rock of ""My Non-Fights"" that something's 
    missing, and the album isn't really satisfying. And anyway, this is music 
    that most people will either love for its exuberant lack of discipline or 
    hate for the very same reason, and something makes me suspect the former 
    camp will leave wishing for a bigger dose.</p></div>"|4007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4007-ackrillvenning-91/|6.8|Joe Tangari

Created under bedroom-like conditions by Ben Cooper and Alex Kane, these earnest songs are largely crafted through a soft and reliable mixture of acoustic strums, clip-clop beats, and gently surging electronic tides. Cooper's chirpy, boyish vocals make comparisons to Ben Gibbard that much more mandatory, but the album quietly moves to its own private compass, drawn by a certain resigned, melancholic gravity. The biggest hitch is that Electric President seemingly achieve all of their humble goals by mid-album, and so spend almost half their time with pencils down, repeating the day's assignments silently to themselves.</p><p>
    
    ""We're all just part of someone's elaborate plan/ Just pieces in some grandiose scheme,"" Cooper sings on ""Grand Machine No. 12"", succinctly articulating the album's recurrent theme of a vague alienation and eventual obsolescence. This sense of helpless entropy also informs the album's most engaging track, ""Ten Thousand Lines"", where Cooper serenades the decaying wires in his bedroom wall over a gentle feedback throb reminiscent of Yo La Tengo's <em>Electr-O-Pura</em>. Additionally, this track is expertly punctuated by overlapping vocals, deftly edited dialogues between guitar and laptop, and several melodic ""Oh no's"" worthy of the Rutles. Even more ambitious-- but no less effective-- is the opening ""Good Morning, Hypocrite"", which is virtually the only song here that Electric President sound willing to forcefully coerce into a new direction, its perky tempo abruptly accelerating until Cooper's vocal is just barely able catch onto the rear bumper.</p><p>
    
    It isn't long, however, before the album's persistent threads of indeterminate loss and decline turn inevitably to undiluted moping over failed romances. ""Hum"" is a purebred fire escape lament, with a heartsick Cooper calling out, ""What do you think about me now?"" to the disinterested rooftops. And he's still out there later on ""Some Crap About the Future"", wistfully watching airplanes leave the city, self-consciously admitting to ineffectual ""rambling"" but not able to bring himself to stop. Unfortunately, on these occasions Electric President are unable to musically assuage his sorrows, having already pushed the limits on their invention. Cuts like the miniature shoegaze of ""Snow on Dead Neighborhoods"" or the politely grungy ""We Were Never Built To Last"" veritably beg for less constraint, more sweeping grandeur, or simply heightened volume to allow a push beyond the duo's established templates. But Electric President remain steadfastly restrained throughout, right up until the willowy, climactic ""Farewell"" where they at last unleash a measured broadside of furious noise, willing for once to become the forceful architects of their music rather than merely its passive stewards.</p></div>"|2938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2938-electric-president/|6.7|Matthew Murphy

He specialized (still does, actually) in barroom laments that worry a sentiment threadbare in only a few verses, before moving on to a just-slightly-different sentiment in a new song. His lyrics, which expound on the typical honkytonk subjects of prison, poverty, sobriety, and doomed romance, are dense with wrenching wordplay and reversals of phrases that seem to heighten his self-loathing, turning his misery into a joke so half-hearted it'll make you cry just as easily as smile.</p>
<p>But it's his delivery that really sells the heartache. Instead of airing his emotions publicly, Haggard stoppers them with a formidably stoic front. Crucially, his masculine façade always sounds on the verge of crumbling, but not even a line like ""I'll give my everything, but you don't even try"" (from ""You Don't Even Try"") can unleash the flood. Haggard's tears always remain private, but rather than closing off these songs, his brave-faced delivery makes them all the more sympathetic, which is their most important quality. Country music is best when listeners can relate to the songs and invest them with their own experiences-- a notion Haggard obviously buys into. He even lays it all out in ""Someone Told My Story"", explaining the relationship between singer and audience better than any critic could:</p>
<p><i>I played a brand-new record on the jukebox<br/> And I scarcely could believe the song I heard<br/> It told of how you left me for another<br/> It was almost like I'd written every word</i></p>
<p>Someone told my story in a song<br/> The lyrics told of happiness and home<br/> Then it told of how you done me wrong<br/> Someone told my story in a song</p>
<p>That song is from Haggard's 1967 album <i>I'm a Lonesome Fugitive</i>, one of ten included in Capitol's generous reissue set: five discs containing two albums each (four of the ten have never been available on CD before), along with more than 20 bonus tracks. Listening to them chronologically-- starting with <i>Strangers</i> in 1965 and ending with 1971's <i>Someday We'll Look Back</i>-- is like reading an epic American novel: Haggard has Twain's wit (no exaggeration), Steinbeck's eye for the vagaries of poor America, and Horatio Alger's bootstrap sentimentality. These albums are weighty with lyrical details drawn from Haggard's own life (his dirt-poor upbringing, rebellious adolescence, and numerous incarcerations, escapes, and marriages) and reveal an artist torn between his birthplace of California and his family's home in Oklahoma, between the familiarity of heartache and the suspected complacency of happiness, between the security of home and the lure of hopping that freight and seeing what's a little farther down the line.</p>
<p>Perhaps ironically, for all his ramblin' ways, Haggard wasn't much of a boundary-pusher musically-- at least not like Willie Nelson or even Johnny Cash. The Bakersfield sound he helped to pioneer, following the leads of Buck Owens and Wynn Stewart, was more a product of circumstance and geography than of concerted innovation, and his blend of traditional country, honkytonk, jazz, and rock seems fully developed on his very first songs. As a result, there's only a little deviation in sound between these 10 albums, and Haggard doesn't stray too far from his very traditional songwriting approach or rough-and-tumble subject matter. Nor does he need to. His sound is sturdy, his lyrics surprisingly complex, his structures perfectly concise. Plus, most of these songs, while not outright autobiographical, carry the weight of true experience, which makes them all the more relatable.</p>
<p>Released in 1965 and 1966 respectively, <i>Strangers</i> and <i>Swinging Doors and the Bottle Let Me Down</i> (the latter named for its two singles) establishes a template for nearly every song that follows: an effective formula of humor and pathos, earnest self-deprecation and randy braggadocio, with no wasted notes or words, and even fewer pretensions. Most of these tracks-- but especially these earlier numbers-- sound like they've been devised and developed in front of live audiences, their get-to-the-point directness and standout melodies all calculated to get people off their barstools and onto the dance floor, whether they're slow-dancing to ""I'll Trade All of My Tomorrows"" or scooting scuffed boots to ""Please Mr. DJ"". Haggard's band, dubbed the Strangers after his first big hit, sounds road-hardened on rollicking numbers like ""The Girl Turned Ripe"" (next line: ""and pickers came today""), barely bottled by the strictures of the songs. They're reluctantly holding back, and occasionally they do cut loose: An incessant piano boogie drives the randy and upbeat ""If You Want to Be My Woman"" (off <i>I'm a Lonesome Fugitive</i>), and pedal-steel tears drip wearily on ""I Threw Away the Rose"" (from <i>Branded</i>), and the energetic, near-reggae ""Seeing Eye Dogs"" (from <i>Sing Me Back Home</i>) sounds like it might have been the band's favorite live number.</p>
<p>Pairing these albums two per disc is economic, but the choices reveal the gentle disparities between them: <i>Strangers</i> and <i>Swinging Doors and the Bottle Let Me Down</i> are well matched, but <i>I'm a Lonesome Fugitive</i> overshadows <i>Branded</i>, and <i>Hag</i> sounds like a warm-up to <i>Someday We'll Look Back</i>. Furthermore, this format reinforces the uniformity of sound across Haggard's early albums. So the banjo that kicks off ""The Legend of Bonnie &amp; Clyde"" is incredibly jolting, not just because it's the first time that instrument has appeared on a Haggard song, but moreover because it reveals just how deceptively basic his sound is. He and his band were able to make the traditional setup of guitar, bass, drums, piano, and voice sound like so much more. But on <i>Bonnie &amp; Clyde</i> he starts to branch out a little, toying around with arrangements and expanding his Bakersfield-based sound. A short acoustic guitar theme two-steps through ""Fool's Castle"", and a deep piano melody-- the left hand of rock'n'roll's boogie rhythm-- puts the question mark in ""Will You Visit Me on Sundays?"" As a result, <i>Bonnie &amp; Clyde</i> is perhaps this set's most diverse album, showcasing the breadth of his sound and the depth of his material.</p>
<p><i>Mama Tried</i>, however, is the highlight. Starting off with the majestically regretful title track-- which is reportedly Haggard's apology to his mother for his wayward youth-- the album collects some of his most assured and accomplished songs, including a chugging cover of Johnny Cash's ""Folsom Prison Blues"". <i>Pride in What I Am</i> continues that dynamic, making that disc the most solid of these reissues. Kicking off the final disc, <i>Hag</i> never really gets its footing, although ""The Sidewalks of Chicago"" is one of Haggard's most devastating singles. Compared to that scattershot collection, <i>Someday We'll Look Back</i> almost sounds like a concept album: Songs like ""One Row at a Time"", ""California Cottonfields"", and ""Tulare Dust"" recount the Haggard family's move from Oklahoma to Oildale, California, where they lived in a converted boxcar. Although he was born in California, Haggard felt like the Midwest was his home, and <i>Someday We'll Look Back</i> addresses this as if it's his definitive conflict, the source of all his nervy wanderlust.</p>
<p>This final disc also introduces a new facet of Haggard and perhaps the most notorious: the outspoken, self-justifying, flag-waving, hippie-baiting conservative that was made famous by ""Okee from Muskogee"". Only a few songs here are politically charged, and those that target hippies, like ""I've Done It All"" and ""Big Time Annie's Square"", make it a class issue, treating them in much the same way early country artists ridiculed the snooty upper crust: For Haggard, hippies had the luxury for their leftist leanings, which conflicts with his blue-collar beliefs. However, on the whole, these reissues give politics a pass, omitting ""Okee"" when it would have been easy to sneak his most notorious hit on as a bonus track. It's a strategic decision. Without the looming shadow of Haggard's legitimate politics (which, it could be argued, have denied him his rightful popular legacy), the music becomes the primary focus, revealing the magnitude of Haggard's impact and arguing persuasively that these 10 albums are the wellspring of modern country music.</p></div>"|11752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11752-strangersswinging-doors-and-the-bottle-let-me-down-im-a-lonesome-fugitivebranded-sing-me-back-homethe-legend-of-bonnie-and-clyde-mama-triedproud-of-what-i-am-hagsomeday-well-look-back/|8.8|Stephen M.

<p>That song is from Haggard's 1967 album <i>I'm a Lonesome Fugitive</i>, one of ten included in Capitol's generous reissue set: five discs containing two albums each (four of the ten have never been available on CD before), along with more than 20 bonus tracks. Listening to them chronologically-- starting with <i>Strangers</i> in 1965 and ending with 1971's <i>Someday We'll Look Back</i>-- is like reading an epic American novel: Haggard has Twain's wit (no exaggeration), Steinbeck's eye for the vagaries of poor America, and Horatio Alger's bootstrap sentimentality. These albums are weighty with lyrical details drawn from Haggard's own life (his dirt-poor upbringing, rebellious adolescence, and numerous incarcerations, escapes, and marriages) and reveal an artist torn between his birthplace of California and his family's home in Oklahoma, between the familiarity of heartache and the suspected complacency of happiness, between the security of home and the lure of hopping that freight and seeing what's a little farther down the line.</p>
<p>Perhaps ironically, for all his ramblin' ways, Haggard wasn't much of a boundary-pusher musically-- at least not like Willie Nelson or even Johnny Cash. The Bakersfield sound he helped to pioneer, following the leads of Buck Owens and Wynn Stewart, was more a product of circumstance and geography than of concerted innovation, and his blend of traditional country, honkytonk, jazz, and rock seems fully developed on his very first songs. As a result, there's only a little deviation in sound between these 10 albums, and Haggard doesn't stray too far from his very traditional songwriting approach or rough-and-tumble subject matter. Nor does he need to. His sound is sturdy, his lyrics surprisingly complex, his structures perfectly concise. Plus, most of these songs, while not outright autobiographical, carry the weight of true experience, which makes them all the more relatable.</p>
<p>Released in 1965 and 1966 respectively, <i>Strangers</i> and <i>Swinging Doors and the Bottle Let Me Down</i> (the latter named for its two singles) establishes a template for nearly every song that follows: an effective formula of humor and pathos, earnest self-deprecation and randy braggadocio, with no wasted notes or words, and even fewer pretensions. Most of these tracks-- but especially these earlier numbers-- sound like they've been devised and developed in front of live audiences, their get-to-the-point directness and standout melodies all calculated to get people off their barstools and onto the dance floor, whether they're slow-dancing to ""I'll Trade All of My Tomorrows"" or scooting scuffed boots to ""Please Mr. DJ"". Haggard's band, dubbed the Strangers after his first big hit, sounds road-hardened on rollicking numbers like ""The Girl Turned Ripe"" (next line: ""and pickers came today""), barely bottled by the strictures of the songs. They're reluctantly holding back, and occasionally they do cut loose: An incessant piano boogie drives the randy and upbeat ""If You Want to Be My Woman"" (off <i>I'm a Lonesome Fugitive</i>), and pedal-steel tears drip wearily on ""I Threw Away the Rose"" (from <i>Branded</i>), and the energetic, near-reggae ""Seeing Eye Dogs"" (from <i>Sing Me Back Home</i>) sounds like it might have been the band's favorite live number.</p>
<p>Pairing these albums two per disc is economic, but the choices reveal the gentle disparities between them: <i>Strangers</i> and <i>Swinging Doors and the Bottle Let Me Down</i> are well matched, but <i>I'm a Lonesome Fugitive</i> overshadows <i>Branded</i>, and <i>Hag</i> sounds like a warm-up to <i>Someday We'll Look Back</i>. Furthermore, this format reinforces the uniformity of sound across Haggard's early albums. So the banjo that kicks off ""The Legend of Bonnie &amp; Clyde"" is incredibly jolting, not just because it's the first time that instrument has appeared on a Haggard song, but moreover because it reveals just how deceptively basic his sound is. He and his band were able to make the traditional setup of guitar, bass, drums, piano, and voice sound like so much more. But on <i>Bonnie &amp; Clyde</i> he starts to branch out a little, toying around with arrangements and expanding his Bakersfield-based sound. A short acoustic guitar theme two-steps through ""Fool's Castle"", and a deep piano melody-- the left hand of rock'n'roll's boogie rhythm-- puts the question mark in ""Will You Visit Me on Sundays?"" As a result, <i>Bonnie &amp; Clyde</i> is perhaps this set's most diverse album, showcasing the breadth of his sound and the depth of his material.</p>
<p><i>Mama Tried</i>, however, is the highlight. Starting off with the majestically regretful title track-- which is reportedly Haggard's apology to his mother for his wayward youth-- the album collects some of his most assured and accomplished songs, including a chugging cover of Johnny Cash's ""Folsom Prison Blues"". <i>Pride in What I Am</i> continues that dynamic, making that disc the most solid of these reissues. Kicking off the final disc, <i>Hag</i> never really gets its footing, although ""The Sidewalks of Chicago"" is one of Haggard's most devastating singles. Compared to that scattershot collection, <i>Someday We'll Look Back</i> almost sounds like a concept album: Songs like ""One Row at a Time"", ""California Cottonfields"", and ""Tulare Dust"" recount the Haggard family's move from Oklahoma to Oildale, California, where they lived in a converted boxcar. Although he was born in California, Haggard felt like the Midwest was his home, and <i>Someday We'll Look Back</i> addresses this as if it's his definitive conflict, the source of all his nervy wanderlust.</p>
<p>This final disc also introduces a new facet of Haggard and perhaps the most notorious: the outspoken, self-justifying, flag-waving, hippie-baiting conservative that was made famous by ""Okee from Muskogee"". Only a few songs here are politically charged, and those that target hippies, like ""I've Done It All"" and ""Big Time Annie's Square"", make it a class issue, treating them in much the same way early country artists ridiculed the snooty upper crust: For Haggard, hippies had the luxury for their leftist leanings, which conflicts with his blue-collar beliefs. However, on the whole, these reissues give politics a pass, omitting ""Okee"" when it would have been easy to sneak his most notorious hit on as a bonus track. It's a strategic decision. Without the looming shadow of Haggard's legitimate politics (which, it could be argued, have denied him his rightful popular legacy), the music becomes the primary focus, revealing the magnitude of Haggard's impact and arguing persuasively that these 10 albums are the wellspring of modern country music.</p></div>"|11752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11752-strangersswinging-doors-and-the-bottle-let-me-down-im-a-lonesome-fugitivebranded-sing-me-back-homethe-legend-of-bonnie-and-clyde-mama-triedproud-of-what-i-am-hagsomeday-well-look-back/|8.4|Stephen M.

He specialized (still does, actually) in barroom laments that worry a sentiment threadbare in only a few verses, before moving on to a just-slightly-different sentiment in a new song. His lyrics, which expound on the typical honkytonk subjects of prison, poverty, sobriety, and doomed romance, are dense with wrenching wordplay and reversals of phrases that seem to heighten his self-loathing, turning his misery into a joke so half-hearted it'll make you cry just as easily as smile.</p>
<p>But it's his delivery that really sells the heartache. Instead of airing his emotions publicly, Haggard stoppers them with a formidably stoic front. Crucially, his masculine façade always sounds on the verge of crumbling, but not even a line like ""I'll give my everything, but you don't even try"" (from ""You Don't Even Try"") can unleash the flood. Haggard's tears always remain private, but rather than closing off these songs, his brave-faced delivery makes them all the more sympathetic, which is their most important quality. Country music is best when listeners can relate to the songs and invest them with their own experiences-- a notion Haggard obviously buys into. He even lays it all out in ""Someone Told My Story"", explaining the relationship between singer and audience better than any critic could:</p>
<p><i>I played a brand-new record on the jukebox<br/> And I scarcely could believe the song I heard<br/> It told of how you left me for another<br/> It was almost like I'd written every word</i></p>

But on <i>Bonnie &amp; Clyde</i> he starts to branch out a little, toying around with arrangements and expanding his Bakersfield-based sound. A short acoustic guitar theme two-steps through ""Fool's Castle"", and a deep piano melody-- the left hand of rock'n'roll's boogie rhythm-- puts the question mark in ""Will You Visit Me on Sundays?"" As a result, <i>Bonnie &amp; Clyde</i> is perhaps this set's most diverse album, showcasing the breadth of his sound and the depth of his material.</p>
<p><i>Mama Tried</i>, however, is the highlight. Starting off with the majestically regretful title track-- which is reportedly Haggard's apology to his mother for his wayward youth-- the album collects some of his most assured and accomplished songs, including a chugging cover of Johnny Cash's ""Folsom Prison Blues"". <i>Pride in What I Am</i> continues that dynamic, making that disc the most solid of these reissues. Kicking off the final disc, <i>Hag</i> never really gets its footing, although ""The Sidewalks of Chicago"" is one of Haggard's most devastating singles. Compared to that scattershot collection, <i>Someday We'll Look Back</i> almost sounds like a concept album: Songs like ""One Row at a Time"", ""California Cottonfields"", and ""Tulare Dust"" recount the Haggard family's move from Oklahoma to Oildale, California, where they lived in a converted boxcar. Although he was born in California, Haggard felt like the Midwest was his home, and <i>Someday We'll Look Back</i> addresses this as if it's his definitive conflict, the source of all his nervy wanderlust.</p>
<p>This final disc also introduces a new facet of Haggard and perhaps the most notorious: the outspoken, self-justifying, flag-waving, hippie-baiting conservative that was made famous by ""Okee from Muskogee"". Only a few songs here are politically charged, and those that target hippies, like ""I've Done It All"" and ""Big Time Annie's Square"", make it a class issue, treating them in much the same way early country artists ridiculed the snooty upper crust: For Haggard, hippies had the luxury for their leftist leanings, which conflicts with his blue-collar beliefs. However, on the whole, these reissues give politics a pass, omitting ""Okee"" when it would have been easy to sneak his most notorious hit on as a bonus track. It's a strategic decision. Without the looming shadow of Haggard's legitimate politics (which, it could be argued, have denied him his rightful popular legacy), the music becomes the primary focus, revealing the magnitude of Haggard's impact and arguing persuasively that these 10 albums are the wellspring of modern country music.</p></div>"|11752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11752-strangersswinging-doors-and-the-bottle-let-me-down-im-a-lonesome-fugitivebranded-sing-me-back-homethe-legend-of-bonnie-and-clyde-mama-triedproud-of-what-i-am-hagsomeday-well-look-back/|8.9|Stephen M.

Minneapolis-based Tapes 'n Tapes do it by the book-- that's to say, off the cuff, taking cues from indie legends and newies alike with star-pupil rigor, but never sweating the exam.  Here's a charismatic, playfully slipshod band unconcerned with making all the loose ends meet up, audacious enough to leave the dot-connecting to us.  But then, never quite knowing which Feelies riff or Malkmus vocal turn or, hell, CYHSY organ sound these guys will strike with next is precisely what makes <em>The Loon</em> such a rich, participatory, and eminently repeatable experience.</p><p>  Tapes 'n Tapes kneel before Pavement, Wire, Beach Boys, and Pixies, bearing their influences more publically than notebook logo sketches.  But facing the task of averting obviousness, they play the uncool card: ""The Iliad"" dresses its keystones in afro-MIDI percussion, cuica and humorously fake timbale, its garb recalling the shy kid in sculpture class who could be a hipster if not for those Sketchers: Are the kicks a defense mechanism, ironic one-upmanship, or just a really good deal at TJ Maxx?  It's all part of their unpretentious approachability and charm.  Tandem tracks ""In Houston"" and ""Manitoba"" lounge out with surprise vibe melodies, incongruously smooth counterpoints to an otherwise gruff sound. But the move doesn't raise eyebrows, instead fostering a mellow whiskey-belly warmth. Inconsistency, Tapes 'n Tapes understand, adds character and colorizes personality; it also keeps listeners off-balance and wanting more.</p><p>  If their aesthetic choices sometimes bewilder, the vocals hit nearer mindfuck.  Resistant to the emotionally soaring, soft-spot-as-high-point bone their forebears never hesitated to throw, Tapes 'n Tapes seethe smarm and snark. ""I've been a better lover with your mother,"" frontman Josh Grier snarls over restless, incorrigible strums on ""Cowbell"". But while smack talk's good for a snicker, the band choose introspection over in-joke on ""Insistor"", whose initially hushed, scat-quick vocals rise to meet the song's surging polka rhythm for a transcendent chorus: ""And when you rush I'll call your name like Harvard Square holds all inane."" Delivered with just enough desperation to defeat its inscrutability, the line's sweet as Nutella from the jar, and probably healthier.</p><p>  Unknowable lyrics aren't the only device Tapes 'n Tapes use to summon their primary influence (ahem, Pavement); the band's strict strums-over-riffs philosophy activates last-decade memories, too.  ""10 Gallon Ascots"", alternately the album's softest and loudest cut, rides a furtive, sneaking rhythm that seems channelled straight from ""Stop Breathin'"", while ""In Houston"" fuses its ""Two States"" two-beat stomp to the record's most Malkmusian vocal articulation, an allusion so overt (and dead-on) it verges on memorial.  But the band forgoes their heroes' ascetic brevity-- they're just too happy to wail, and too hyperactive to be stopped. ""Crazy Eights"" balloons from 90-second instrumental placeholder to something more complex after suddenly wormholing from casual swing to overdriven straight-time; ""Manitoba"" shakes off its blissful pre-dawn slumber to kick an ecstatic, vibraphone-free coda.</p><p>  While strong faith is always convincing, Tapes 'n Tapes succeed by practice as much as passion, articulating a conventional vocabulary with rare erudition.  As such, <em>The Loon</em> brings something for everybody.  Not that the band's diplomacy is a kowtow: Loving is just their quaint way of asking for love. Credit yourself if you can get down with a program offering up so many been-there-done-that indicators.  Or better, credit the band for avoiding the toothless mush that typically results from this sort of populism, and arriving instead at a fresh vision through eloquent pastiche.</p><p> </p></div>"|8314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8314-the-loon/|8.3|Sam Ubl

Though their studio albums and singles were great (the singles a little greater), the band's ratio of studio-to-live records is now equal for good reason: live performance was where the Make-Up thrived. If you weren't there, here's reason #2 to kick yourself for it.</p><p>
    
    To many people, that's all the live album really functions as: a souvenir to an event you likely never attended, like a program to a play or baseball game you missed, with the bonus of crowd noise and songs you already love recorded in shittier quality. I still favor the live record as document, an etch in time of certain lineups, setlists, potential versatility (read as: ""jamming""), and possibly some entertaining banter from the band (if you like hearing Ian Svenonious say ""Yeah?"" and ""hold on,"" oh boy, you're in luck).</p><p>
    
    However, the Make-Up are even fucking with the record's historical value, making any details frustratingly vague.  The liner notes only tell you it was recorded ""one day in 2000,"" the included description of the show holds no basis in reality, and even between-song thanks to the other acts on the bill are curiously backmasked instead of edited out.  Clearly, careful history is not the band's strong suit; they're more intent on subverting their place in it.  Live records are hallway fodder in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame; Svenonious, Michelle Mae and crew would likely storm through its doors spray-painting the walls, one of them holding a boombox blasting Prince tapes while they did it.</p><p>
<i>Untouchable Sound</i> doesn't have the same thrill as the off-the-cuff sneak previews of <i>Destination: Love</i> or <i>After Dark</i>, but it does boast a more familiar setlist and a more commanding grasp of their signature sound-- more minimal while making better use of organ, thin guitars, and throbbing bass. Just from the relentless hammering and dramatic pauses of the crowd-baiting intro, their dynamic presence cuts through speakers.  Indeed, something still crackles dangerously from the corpse of the Make-Up, and it isn't their brand of irony (say ""gospel yeh-yeh"" with a straight face, I dare you).  Their languid ""Wade in the Water"" simmers and spatters, and then-new tracks like ""Born on the Floor"" and ""White Belt"" are towering infernos left from their ruthless desecration of funk and soul. Just as Hendrix so loved his guitar he had to burn it in front of thousands, so the-Make-Up had to tear the music they loved a new orifice on stage and glaze it in irony to pay it necessary tribute.</p><p>
    
    The Make-Up have long been my indie rock defilers of choice, far more lively and sharper-fanged than Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, wirier and more visceral than any of Svenonius' other bands. Why hide behind a veil of irony and obfustication? Why wait so long to put the record out? They may have been celebrating cliche, but to think the act was empty-- or needs the easy defense of irony-- is a mistake, especially given the immediate influence they had on their peers (I'm not talking about the [International] Noise Conspiracy). We've seen a lot of trends and revivals crop up and wilt in a half-decade of recent history, but despite the band's best efforts, the Make-Up have cemented their place in it.</p></div>"|5054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5054-untouchable-sound/|7.6|Jason Crock

But when it comes to the math-rock lullabies he creates with his own band, Raising the Fawn, he's a much more insular soul.</p><p>
    Unlike so many bands orbiting planet BSS, Raising the Fawn isn't just another occasion for the Arts &amp; Crafts extended family to get together for group handclaps. There are no backup vocal turns from Feist, no guest appearances by Brendan Canning on shakers. If anything, Crossingham is a rarity among his BSS peers for favoring a less-is-more approach: Since its formation in 2000, Raising the Fawn has downsized from a four-piece to a trio, and effectively trimmed any fat inhibiting a more powerful rock approach.</p><p>
    The band's self-titled 2001 debut was a delicate collection of porcelain pop songs that Crossingham openly admitted was one big long soppy mash note to his girl (ex-Fawn drummer Lesa Hannah); 2004's more accomplished <i>The North Sea</i> closely followed in Mogwai's footsteps, lamenting long-distance love and eulogizing the dead (Crossingham's grandmother and Acetone frontman Richie Lee included) in lurching 10-minute movements.  But if new album <i>The Maginot Line</i>, the first Fawn full-length recorded as a trio, is decidedly less sentimental or cohesive in tone than its predecessors, it's all the braver for it.</p><p>
    Following a minute of sustained feedback (generously given its own title, ""Pyotr""), <i>Maginot</i> opens in earnest with ""Carbon Paper"", a flurry of crashing grandeur that, like Death Cab's ""The New Year"" or Trail of Dead's ""Relative Ways"", heralds a newfound sense of clarity and confidence. While the latter band would've seemed like a laughably incongruous reference point for the Fawn five years ago, these days both strive for a similar balance of melody and menace, elegance and ugliness.  Here, the Fawn's own gradual evolution is reflected in a handful of amorphous six-minute mini-epics: The title track sends Crossingham's coo on an upward surge of Sonic Youth-ish twinkles and tribal floor-tom thumps, slowly accruing a militaristic intensity before locking into nasty gutter blues; centerpiece track ""Christmastime in the Fields"" begins as a faint sea shanty that hitches onto a sinister bass pulse to brace us for the turbulence to come; and ""Until It Starts Again"" starts like a standard-issue Slint-esque prowl, only to evolve as it hits its soul-clap chorus.</p><p>
    Where Broken Social Scene's narcotic-pop floats effortlessly skyward, Raising the Fawn strive for the same heights through a painstaking, brick-by-brick effort: guitars short out, harmonies crack, and calloused fingers grind fretboards with each abrupt chord change. Unsurprisingly, the songs here with more modest intents-- the straight jangle ballad ""The Cloak and the Veil"", or the sullen, Sebadoh-like denouement ""Nocturne No. 2""-- don't inspire the same degree of emotional investment, never tapping into the band's talent for subtle transformation.  <i>The Maginot Line</i> is a suitably precarious, frequently thrilling high-wire act for a band that, back home in Toronto, can open for anybody from Mogwai to the Wrens.  Still, Raising the Fawn's singular identity is truly revealed when they refuse to fully identify with either camp.</p></div>"|6954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6954-the-maginot-line/|7.6|Stuart Berman

Plus, they come cheaper.  Well, Philip Samartzis' label, Plates of Sound, has sprung for interminable (and pretty) liner notes, in two languages and character sets; this is money they could have kept and spent on a little more mystery.  Here's your quick gloss: Samartzis, a professor or something at Melbourne's RMIT University, went to Tokyo and field-recorded a bunch of everyday type spots. He then laboriously sound-designed the fuck out of his tape, presented it as an eight speaker, quad-sound installation in 2001, and released it as <i>Soft and Loud</i>, first to CD (on his own label, Microphonics), and now to vinyl.  It is, according to Samartzis, a narrative documentary type thing that is also democratic, because the mix is layered such that rather than forcing one particular sound or ""sweet spot"" of reception, the listener can wander around in the sound as he or she chooses.</p><p>
    On the aural upside, Samartzis' ability to clamp down on his crystalline samples varies inversely with his super-loose talking lips (and to be fair, the man helped found Australian pioneer turntable noise act Gum, and rocks with dudes like Keiji Haino and Oren Ambarchi). Dying-art musique concrète might feel too easy for your average MaxMSP G4 wielder, but here, Samartzis acts like he still has to splice his own tape reels.  So <i>Soft and Loud</i> is less pastiched than painstakingly sequenced, which sells the whole day-spent-on-a-foreign-park-bench chronology he writes to death on paper.  Electronic birdcalls wander in, as do pedestrian crossing noises, dudes yelling-- lots of silence, which only makes sense-- filled out with gentle forest and city clicking.</p><p>
    It's nice, in the CDR era, to trust a composer. His passing train builds smartly into warbling winds, or wet hisses dissolve into a gong; sounds get French-intellectual in the way they inter-refer and derive meaning entirely in juxtaposition. Sure, he does that whole ""isn't this pre-recorded chestnut salesman's jingling sales-pitch actually musical?"" thing that battles (probably) long dead philistines, but his sense of texture and pace far outweighs his own sense of importance.</p><p>
    The myriad little discretes stack well; Samartzis has invented a wildly dense, interwoven but calm logic for the worlds he recorded.  And if that reads too pretentious for ya, figure this: If you haven't been to Tokyo, sounds like you should really go.</p></div>"|7846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7846-soft-and-loud/|6.7|Zach Baron

Sure, all the other bands say you can't get addicted, and they may be right-- after all, how many bands have done <em>two</em> double albums?  But what those ""friends"" don't tell you is that the double album is the first step on the path to rock star excess, leading inevitably to hiring Phil Spector as a producer, a dalliance with some kind of exotic religion, and the sudden compulsion to do something ""multimedia.""  Years later, you find yourself choreographing a rock opera performed on ice, and thinking, ""Oh, if only I hadn't made that seemingly innocent choice to not edit my album down to one disc.  Woe!""</p><p>
    Is it too late to save Eels from this path of meteoric destruction, now that they've foolishly indulged in the double album with last year's <i>Blinking Lights and Other Revelations</i>?  Early evidence is discouraging, as they already exhibit two symptoms of long-term effects upon good judgment: the borderline innocuous ""live album,"" and the much more worrisome ""with strings.""  Such words often portend the addition of Michael Kamen to the rolodex, a move towards Moody Blues-style hyper-orchestration, or tour dates at the Acropolis.</p><p>
    Fortunately, Eels letterman Mark Everett (more commonly known as just ""E"") is partial to minimal arrangements, a tendency that keeps him from ordering up 75-piece orchestra buckets and slathering crescendos onto every chorus.  In fact, the ""strings"" of this album's title are merely a humble quartet, and despite second billing, their contributions are kept subtle, balanced well against the pile of musical toys that E and his unclassically trained companions pluck and bang.  There aren't any overtures or Copland quotes, just 19 Eels songs (mostly from <i>Blinking Lights</i>) and three covers, rearranged for a drum-less orchestra-geek lineup.</p><p>
    The scarcity of percussion on all but a handful of <i>With Strings</i>' tracks lends the entire set a ghostly feel, which works both for and against E's vision.  On one hand, here's hoping Town Hall was a seated venue; unless there were some serious pyrotechnics, it may have been a rough haul for audience members working on a short night's sleep.  Yet, the sparse arrangements turn out some fascinating moments, with the strings often used as background color while singing saw, pump organ, or vibraphone hits take the starring role.  A medley of ""Flyswatter"" with the obligatory (but disassembled) ""Novocaine for the Soul"" successfully wraps all these elements together, a stretch that sounds spookily improvised in contrast to the chart-reading restrictions of the set's bulk.</p><p>
    Still, the most electric moments come when the band momentarily shakes off the drear and lets loose: the sharp found-object drumming of <i>Blinking Lights</i>' finest track ""Trouble With Dreams,"" or the respectful cover of the Left Banke's ""Pretty Ballerina"", which allows the strings to finally swoop.  I'm déjà vu-ing myself here, but these sparkly, weird, subversive pop moments far outshine the too-frequent occasions in which E fancies himself a folk singer, obsessed with working-class imagery and leaning too hard on his Velcro rasp of a voice.</p><p>
    So go ahead and grant the Eels an exemption for going the orchestra tour route; the additional personnel justifies their paychecks by saving this live album from being a rote greatest-hits-with-crowd-noise exercise.  The record's occasional dragging moments stem less from Boston Pops syrup than from E's maudlin stumbles, or the sometimes oppressively uniform melancholy he prefers.  For now, Eels have put the brakes on the slide down the slippery slope of rock clichés, but beware: the lingering effects of double-album experimentation aren't so easily undone.</p></div>"|2689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2689-with-strings-live-at-town-hall/|6.7|Rob Mitchum

In what felt like a series of sucker punches, epic after epic from the Atlanta quartet's second album was rendered with hardcore tightness and punctuated by bassist and vocalist Troy Sanders' puff-chested salty Ahab salutes. The band had signed to Warner around that time; by default, I envisioned the set as a swaggering big-city climax after years of grunt work.</p><p>
    
    Close to a year later, with Sanders, guitarist Bill Kelliher, guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds, and jazz-as-fuck drummer Brann Dailor readying their major label debut, Relapse offers <i>Call of the Mastodon</i>, an official release of the band's first recording session, remastered by original producer Matt Washburn.  Fans will recognize five of these songs from 2001's <i>Lifesblood</i> EP.  The other four tracks have never been available on CD, but if you look hard enough, you can possibly track them down on 7"" vinyl. A fan of warts-and-all, I prefer the older, muddier recordings to the new, shiny constructions. Yes, the upgrades do sound bigger and cleaner, but the energy is somehow snuffed, the overall arc a bit bassy and flat.</p><p>
    
    If you <em>haven't</em> heard early Mastodon, don't expect Voivod echoes, the grandiosity of <i>Remission</i>'s ""Elephant Man"" and ""Trainwreck"", or anything resembling <i>Leviathan</i>'s waterlogged, 13-minute ""Heart's Alive"" or gauzy, acoustic-inflected ""Joseph Merrick.""  Tellingly, the <i>Call of the Mastodon</i> set clocks in at less than half an hour, whereas <i>Leviathan</i>'s 10 tracks unfurl in almost twice that amount of time.  Beside the smarter compositional structures, Hinds and Sanders have evolved as vocalists; the two are now capable of moving between scowls and clearer enunciations. They've also upped the lyrical ante. Although the ocean has always been a consistent theme of theirs, these pieces are more about the drowning breathlessness of a snarl than linking choruses to Moby Dick. Close listens can churn up a few nascent seedlings of later developments, but during this early point in the band's career they were more narrowly focused and brandished less distinctive chops.</p><p>
    
    The first thing <i>Lifesblood</i> initiates will notice is the lack of samples. I'm not one to usually give a shit about any film dialogue opening a rock anthem, but I miss these soundbytes, especially the <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> crescendo of ""Shadows That Move"".  The song's dual guitar haul remains one of the band's finest, but the whirlpool vocals (Poseidon with laryngitis) have been placed a bit lower in the mix.  ""We Built This Come Death""'s caterwauls are the record's strongest, somehow psychedelic and Sabbathian (and, well, Soundgardenian) in their harmonizing howl.</p><p>
    
    The true <i>Lifesblood</i> gem, though, is ""Battle at Sea"", which offers the purest taste of the band's exploratory future.  Here, various vocal textures (screamo, death metal, waling wall) are placed in a tempest of ascending scales, and punctuated with a bassy sea knot, swordfighting guitars, and prog breakdowns.  Again, the vocals have been pulled back a bit and blended more into their surroundings. After repeat listens, I still appreciate the older, rawer version's dry rot and the slithery scream that occasionally rears its head above the wave churn.</p><p>
    
    My favorite of the non-<i>Lifesblood</i> tracks is ""Deep Sea Creature"", which sports an elaborate guitar intro that quickly shifts into a full-on murky, heaving shouter. Two minutes short, ""Thank You for This"" also showcases some Metallica-esque guitarisms and more tuneful vocal lines alongside the typical throat rot; unfortunately, there are also a few very typical metal tropes, including <i>de rigueur</i> crescendos, super speedy hi-hat taps, and ho-hum mosh parts. ""Slickleg"" is more impressive, beckoning a mammoth trapped in ice while squelching acoustic tendencies with immediate, squealing thrash riffs and drums rolling starboard.</p><p>
    
    There's no doubt that the stuff on <i>Call of the Mastodon</i> is more impressive than many bands' early (or even later) catalogues, but metal-to-the-pedal isn't the crew's strong point. Throughout their career, the boys have continually progressed, so while looking backward at this point may be of historical interest, who wants to rock out to the second rate?  Those who don't consider themselves Mastodon diehards might as well wait for the next leap forward on the timeline. Judging from the trek thus far, I imagine it's gonna be seismic.</p></div>"|5144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5144-call-of-the-mastodon/|7.3|Brandon Stosuy

A number of elements line upjust so: the Reich-inspired use of repetition, the blurring oftraditional instruments and computer processing; a reflexive drifttoward the ""cinematic""; an occasional willingness to let songs stretchon longer than someone who grew up listening to punk would imaginenecessary. For their third album, <em>Rideau</em>, Tape even enlisted productiorhelp from Marcus Schmickler, whose first two one-man-band records asPluramon fit snuggly next to Tortoise on an arranged-by-mood CD shelf.</p><p>I still return to certain records from this world (including some byTortoise and Pluramon), but considering how much blah music the scenegenerated, the immediate associations surrounding Tape fail toinspire. It's an obstacle worth getting past, though, because Tape aredoing a lot of things right, and their music is far more engaging tharyou would guess by flipping through a catalog description. <em>Rideau</em> isflat-out <em>pretty</em>, which helps a lot, and Tape has a consistently""on"" compositional sense that builds tension and moves pieceslogically along. A good thing, too, since this record contains theirlongest tracks to date, three of which are more than 11 minutes.</p><p>All virtues are present in opener ""Sunrefrain"", where graduallyunfolding bass, organ, and guitar meander up a mountain pass thatleads to a majestic surge of horns at the peak, a hair-raising refrairthat sounds something like the fanfare from Jóhann Jóhannsson's<em>Virðulegu forsetar</em>. It's the kind of track that rewards patience withan epic payoff. Good will duly established, thevibes come out on ""A Spire"", as Tape follow a brief snatch of melodyas far as it wants to go (which turns out to be the 11:45 mark).Schmickler's role here is key, as he carefully folds in variationsthat remain at the threshold of audibility from bar to bar but accruepretty serious force over longer stretches. He's also got an ear forsubtle but effective processing, cloaking familiar instruments irdistortion to create a sense of dislocation that adds depth to theproject.</p><p>It's a good match that leads to Tape's best music. The two previousrecords are enjoyable, no question, but the drama here trumpseverything else in the catalog. Despite its seemingly demanding tracklengths, <em>Rideau</em> is the Tape album to start with.</p></div>"|7939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7939-rideau/|7.8|Mark Richardson

    The great news is that the Ladies avoid ""In the Fishtank"" syndrome: While those hybrid experiments usually resulted in acts indulging each other's indulgent streaks to record geologically patient jam-bandy unsmooth jazz, guitarist Crow and drummer Hill tighten each other. Literally half of these tracks resemble traditional hummable songs, though they fitfully switch modes and are sequenced to bleed into the avant-something bits of subdued noise-punk, such as the Public Enemy nod ""Black Metal in the Hour of Starbucks"". (Wait, what is ""subdued noise-punk"" supposed to be? Mild chaos? Prog fusion? ""Prusion""?)</p><p>
    
    By now you've deducted that <i>They Mean Us</i> is hardly pop.  Crow may have ""O.C.""-palatable pipes, but he chose the path less emo years ago, and Hill, um, he kind of can't be stopped. Your esteem for this release may well depend on your capacity to withstand Hill's virtuosity. If one were typing about this disc for <i>The New Yorker</i> or the <i>Times</i>, one couldn't be blamed for taking the sweeping time-capsule, pop-anthropology, Da Capo-anthology approach: <i>What does it all mean</i> that there exists in the marketplace a one-man rhythm section who practically solos non-stop? How can one fathom the old communal fantasy of ""bandness"" when the individual so dominates and self-isolates? Is a genius always going to be cast as a fascist underdog in a monoculture? Are we so benumbed by a multiplicity of entertainments that talent has to distinguish itself via relentless, intimidating explosiveness? How totally inappropriate is even a hint of a suicide bomber analogy? Have we cut away the fatty shanks of the bash-ba-donk, lollygagging Clinton-era drum style in favor of the all-skeleton, defender-Bush percussion model? Etc.</p><p>
    
    Hill's skill can wear the listener down, but it's never repellent; he never seems like the sticks-and-skins equivalent of the post-Mariah vocal note-gasming that goes down during that Karaoke Simon show on Fox. The fatigue that Hill can cultivate is similar to what would happen if one stared too long at a chainsaw juggler, or watched that <i>Police Academy</i> sound-effects guy approximate the Peloponnesian War. There's something eerily casual about Hill's stunt barrage. I've just never heard tunes anchored by beats that sound like codeine-y elephant farts, or like a vintage Mercedes growing a goiter.</p><p>
    
    Let not Rob Crow be forgotten: His guitar work here blends calculus-rock strumming with thick trad riffs. To namecheck, ""So Much for the Fourth Wall"" suggests the glacial cinematic whomp of Aereogramme, while ""And Them"" visits the Seattle sludge trough. The assassin confession ""Non-Threatening"" can't help but Kinsella itself, and much of the rest suggests a teenage, antic-but-expansive Sabbath without the plod.</p><p>
    
    Consumer reports: Five tracks are around a minute long, but each prefers risk to mere competence. Besides, one track takes up over a third of the album's running time. (It's lazily titled, but for a mandatory psycho-freakout, ""Mandatory Psycho-Freakout"" is an honorable mandatory psycho-freakout.) Until the day that Xiu Xiu teams with Richard X, the Ladies' rampant precision will suffice.</p></div>"|5003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5003-they-mean-us/|7.2|William Bowers

Even ""indie metal,"" ""indie folk,"" and ""indie jazz"" ratchet up at least 200,000 hits each. But ""indie funk""? Just 26,100. ""Indie r&amp;b;"" fares even worse, at under a thousand connections.  This dearth of DIY lovermen and horn snappers is unfortunate, but it makes sense considering the notion of indie-ness is often typified by a subversion of the talent-equals-success trajectory. With outlandish, popular champions from Prince to George Clinton to Rick James, funk seems to require an acute set of raw chops and shameless star-quality to truly transcend.  Thrill Jockey's National Trust try for an elusive indie-funk maneuver with their sophomore album, but the Chicago-based duo largely succumbs to the pitfalls of their lonely genre. Stumbling through twisty bass 'n' falsetto excursions, the band lacks the adequate songwriting gusto and ego-fueled panache to turn its sexed-up conga jams into true bottom-dwelling fiends.</p><p>
    Give them credit, though-- these guys are really going for it, indie ethos be damned. Just one look at the album's cover, which features main men Neil Rosario and Mark Henning striking silly poses in front of a couple pink elevators, makes their commitment to the soul spectacle apparent. Unfortunately, their idea of spectacle isn't exactly spectacular. With <em>Kings &amp; Queens</em>, the Trust siphon out the psych-tinged 70s singer/songwriter leanings of their 2002 debut, <em>Dekaggar</em>, keeping only the elements that make asses move. The pair's penchant for over-orchestration-- <em>Dekaggar</em> infamously took over 500 hours to record-- remains, and more often than not, hinders <em>Kings</em>' libidinous ambitions.</p><p>Clearly, these boys can't grasp the concept of ""say when."" Just sample the stupid-long instrument list: bongos, congas, flute, piccolo, synth, clavinet, vibes, wood block, and glockenspiel. If R. Kelly has proven anything, it's that a classic funk can be gleaned from the sound of a single water drop.  So, these admitted Kells admirers (they even recruited His Trapped-ness' engineer, Abel Garibaldi, to help produce this disc) should know better than to smother the painfully aimless ""Show and Tell"" and over-fed ""Stages"" with undue slops of rhythmic goop.  Aside from the creepy, mouth-breathing intro track, nearly every song on <em>Kings</em> lugs on for more than five minutes; in most cases, they hardly contain enough passable ideas to warrant three.  Still, the group's indulgences crank just right twice, on the electro-bounce of ""It's Just Cruel"" and the Caribbean-dream sway of ""Canday's Away"".</p><p> <em>Kings</em>' slickness is mostly wasted, but works in favor of ""It's Just Cruel"".  ""This 45 is better than the things before,"" sing the duo in pointed falsetto, and in this instance, their conflation of Isley Brothers-smooth and Rick James-strut is worthy of comparison to lofty forbears.  Whereas elsewhere, lines like ""sweat's gonna getcha/ Your body's hot to measure"" sound stuck somewhere between irony and kitsch, here the Trust convincingly enunciates such slick, primal urges.  Likewise, every chime and mouth percussion punctuation of ""Canday's Away"" contributes to its sexed-up longing, allowing the mellow melter to wallow in the fatalistic undercurrent of early-hour lust.</p><p>Indie-funk is a dangerous proposition. On <em>Kings &amp; Queens</em>, chasing the groove sometimes leads to jammy voids filled with wonky synths and bouts of exercise-machine-infomercial bullshit. But it's also a worthy proposition because, as the glimpses here prove, there are few things more undeniable than a thick, icy-hot groove.</p></div>"|5724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5724-kings-queens/|4.4|Ryan Dombal

Luckily, I don't have to-- at least not yet.  While the world patiently awaits a proper Battles full-length, the newly released <i>EP C / B EP</i>, their new UK-only double-disc debut for Warp Records, offers no new material at all.  Instead, it compiles two of the band's previous EPs, proving the only thing stronger than their power to obliterate is their will to beguile: My copy's labels were switched, so <em>C</em> became <em>B</em>, and vice versa.  Not that titles help contextualize things much-- most of them are acronyms like ""SZ2"" and ""Tras 3"" and ""Bttls"".  For those of you wondering where <em>A</em> went, though, Battles have so far worked backward from <em>C</em> (as in cryptic), presumably saving the scarlet letter for their next Warp release.</p><p>
    
    So why do they have my confidence?  Because Battles are tough without being confrontational, innovative without recourse to bells and whistles, and completely transparent in process.  When they're good, they're great; when they're anything less than good, they're so thrillingly alien it doesn't matter.</p><p>
    
    This compiled material basically amounts to a black hole: 66 minutes of the most hypnotic instrumental music currently being purveyed outside techno or Japan. But whereas semi-analogous Sunn O))) and Boris administer hypnotic assaults through deep immersion in drones and brutal low-end, Battles bring the fury with rigorous, unrelenting grooves.  ""Tras2"" hits its stride at the halfway mark, before its odd-metered drum loop starts to decay: Drummer John Stainer gradually drops pieces of the beat until there's nothing left but jerky, decontextualized snare/bass unisons.  ""Hi/Lo"" is a lurching upbeat stomp that leaves gaping-wide chasms for keyboards to fill with carnival pinwheels.</p><p>
    
    Many Battles songs ask the same question: Can challenging, flex-your-brain-muscles music be harsh, bombastic and unsubtle as well?  ""SZ2""'s proposed solution calls on prog-rock chop-worship, attacking nerve centers by force of sheer volume.  Check how the guitars keep three polyrhythms airborne while Stainer beats like an ogre beneath, insisting his 2/4 backbeat take primacy. ""B + T"", meanwhile, pivots around linear guitar/bass/drums interplay, each member handling a complex figure but never stepping forward for more than a brief flare.  So many notes, yet Battles play each like a one-time shot-- a thousand winning swings at the carnival Test-O-Strength.  They never flub.  End of story.</p><p>
    
    The long, inchoate noise pieces that occasionally crop up here aren't meant as palate-cleansers but can serve that purpose if you insist. <em>B</em>, truth be told, comes padded like a rubber room-- the hushed, found-sound-sounding ""Bttls"" writhes like a tree full of electronic crickets for nearly half the EP's length (not counting ""Tras"", a carryover from the band's <em>Tras, Fantasy</em> single).  Night-and-day comparisons become inevitable once ""Dance"" breaks the silence, its blippy, scat-like organ lines pushed by a hurried beat.  Only eight-minute ""Fantasy""-- basically a SETI-watcher's idea of a drum circle-- seems extraneous.</p><p>
    
    Of course, most of us are happy enough just rocking out, cocks optional.  When the kids truly bring it, you hear about them, be they adderall-popping mall-punk naifs or tech-metal swordsmiths.  But Battles start where most are content to finish; a well-toned muscular sound is their bedrock, their means to an end.  Who knows where they'll take it next?  Surprise has so far been their only guarantee.</p></div>"|11695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11695-ep-cb-ep/|8.0|Sam Ubl

To my ears, the tracks he wrote and sang on Wolf Parade's <i>Apologies to the Queen Mary</i>-- ""I'll Believe in Anything, You'll Believe in Anything"", ""Grounds for Divorce"", ""Dear Sons and Daughters of Hungry Ghosts""-- are the album's emotionally soaring, crushed-velvet best.  However, like his longtime pal and occasional bandmate, Frog Eyes' Carey Mercer, Krug's raw, claustrophobically cracked vocal style can be a dealbreaker, and as such, some shunned Sunset Rubdown's lo-fi debut, <i>Snake's Got a Leg</i>, upon its release last year.  I'm sort of addicted to Krug's manic vocal tendencies and off-kilter rhythmic patterns, though-- I'd listen to the guy sing karaoke all night.</p><p>
    
    Minimizing the echo and cleaning up the production, Sunset Rubdown's self-titled EP continues where <em>Snake's</em> closed.  The five songs here are firmly grounded; there's no GBV-style ""Hey You Handsome Vulture"" snippet or toy-box fuzz like on ""Snake's Got a Leg II"".  Still, each piece is stuffed to the resonating brim.  Krug seems to be a fan of windswept, melancholic keyboard lurches, and oddly, of recycling his own catalogue.  For instance, before the definitive version of ""I'll Believe in Anything"" was released on <i>Queen Mary</i>, it appeared on <i>Snake's Got a Leg</i>.  Similarly, this five-song set includes ""Three Colours"" and ""Three Colours II"", in addition to two takes on ""A Day in the Graveyard"".  The rehashing works to create pretty resonances-- it's as though he could spend an entire career reframing the same few songs ad infinitum, and continually expose newer and more elegant angles.</p><p>
    
    Fittingly, the EP opens with guitar repetitions redolent of Sunset Rubdown's earlier take on ""I'll Believe in Anything"".  On ""Three Colors"", though, a slightly ominous Krug asks, ""Do you believe that you belong to someone?/ I can't believe that I belong to no one.""  His queries are backed by psychedelic organ ministrations (often shadowed by guitar), droning vocal harmonies
    (a choir of Spencers, if you will), and a slight flange.  This thread is picked-up by the final, flanged track, ""Three Colors II"", which goes for the manic Frog Eyes treatment and spirals into repetition of the line, ""You should hear the wind at my window.""  Belief is also the subject of ""Jason Believe Me, You Can't Trust Your Dreams"".  I have yet to put my finger on specifics, but the tinny organ reminds me of Bach on harpsichord.  Singing about femurs and skulls and encouraging someone to ""sleep with your eyes open,"" Krug's vocals are doubled up, and the atmosphere is punctuated with lilting, but downcast whistles.</p><p>
    
    The highlight of the EP is the combination of ""A Day in the Graveyard"" and ""A Day in the Graveyard II"".  The first is a sort of sunny throwaway instrumental with gently pretty arpeggios, tap
    dancing claps, loose fur snare, and tambourine-- the way it builds into part deux is rather glorious, seemingly expanding the latter's reach.  After a brief ascension, that ""gentle arpeggio"" hook comes back as a steel drum sound.  We get some words this time, too: a ""rose pedal bed,"" ""sun on my shoes,"" and the sinking feeling that ""if you could make another one of you/ Then
    you wouldn't give the other one to me.""  It's really beautiful.</p><p>
    
    Another full-length from Sunset Rubdown is set for release in May.  For that effort, Klug manages to keep things quiet and spacious, despite showing up with a bona fide band.  If he continues to increase the fidelity and go the ""November Rain"" route, I may have to take a flight to Montreal and crack the recording equipment.  But okay, that's jumping the gun.  These days, he's still tinkering in his basement and creating moonstruck pop songs that emit the feel of a boat slowly sinking; Krug glug-glugging his <em>Hunky Dory</em> loveliness from a tiny radio and going down with the ship.</p></div>"|7817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7817-sunset-rubdown-ep/|7.8|Brandon Stosuy

    there's a good chance all of them will say ""Bob Marley"". As Mark 
    Richardson wrote on this website last month, the <em>Legend</em> compilation 
    is ubiquitous in college dormitories and singularly likely to show up in the 
    collections of people who only own a handful of CDs. People know his Island output, 
    even if they only know the sliver of it presented on that disc, and for 
    many, Marley <em>is</em> reggae-- most people think the Wailers were just the backing 
    band.</p><p>
    
    Well, books could and have been written on the incredible scope of Jamaican 
    music beyond Marley, who for better or worse became its face to most of the 
    world in the 1970s. You could also write tomes telling the story 
    of the Wailers before Chris Blackwell took them global. The core of the 
    Wailers was Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer, and several 
    other members, including Constantine Walker, Beverly Kelso, and Junior 
    Braithwaite came and went over the course of the 60s, when the group 
    recorded with various backing bands for Coxsone Dodd's Studio One label.</p><p>
    
    Between 1963 and 1966, the Wailers cut more than 100 tracks for Dodd, and 
    Heartbeat's <em>One Love at Studio One</em> gathers 40 of them plus one interesting 
    rehearsal onto two discs. This release is essentially a spiffing up of an 
    earlier Heartbeat compilation of the same name, with one added track (the 
    spiritual ""Tell Them Lord"") and greatly improved sound-- the mastering level 
    on this version towers over the original, and the bass presence is kicked 
    way up to accentuate the rhythmic thrust of the group's early ska sides.</p><p>
    
    Curiosities abound on these discs. From a historical perspective, some of 
    the most interesting tracks are their versions of the spirituals ""Sinner 
    Man"", ""Amen"", ""This Train"", and ""Tell Them Lord""-- impassioned takes on 
    Christian songs that function as interesting precursors of their later 
    embrace of Rastafarianism.</p><p>
    
    Though Bob Marley was the acknowledged leader of the group from the 
    start-- and the only one with previous recording experience-- it's important to 
    note that the group was just called the Wailers, without the ""Bob Marley &amp;"" 
    until around 1970, and that other members sang lead on a large number of 
    their songs. Braithwaite, an original member of the group and the 
    first to leave, was Dodd's favorite voice in the group, and he gets his high 
    tenor out in front of the harmonies on ""Habits"" and ""It Hurts to Be Alone"", 
    the latter featuring an unbelievably gorgeous lead guitar part from Ernest 
    Ranglin.</p><p>
    
    The Wailers' first single, ""Simmer Down"", is one of the defining tracks of 
    the ska era, addressing the violence of the Kingston slums in the patois of 
    the people who lived there. The Skatalites provide the breathtaking rhythm 
    track and horn arrangements, and Kelso, Tosh, Wailer, and Braithwaite 
    harmonize the title under Marley's rough-throated verses. For a one-track 
    recording, there's an impressive amount of detail in the mix, and the song 
    became an instant smash when Dodd played it at his sound system dance the 
    same night it was recorded, quickly moving 70,000 copies. If that doesn't 
    sound like a big number, consider that in the 1960s the total population of 
    Jamaica was less than two million.</p><p>
    
    There are a ton of other great ska cuts spread out across the rest of the 
    set, including a number of excellent rude boy tracks that helped establish 
    the Wailers as spokesmen for the ghetto and the warring gangs of dance 
    crashers who ultimately brought the sound systems to their demise in the 
    late 60s. ""Rude Boy"", which later became the basis for ""Rebel's Hop"", and 
    ""Hooligan"" celebrated rudie attitude, the former featuring lyrics like ""the 
    peego a-go lingua"" (roughly, ""the rude girls are gonna' talk""), that 
    illustrated just how deep the slang of the ghettos could get. The group's 
    initial phase closed with ""Jailhouse"", one of countless Jamaican singles of 
    the period that extolled the fearlessness of the rude boys when confronted 
    by the authorities-- the song also shows them transitioning to the slower 
    rocksteady beat that formed the bridge from ska to reggae.</p><p>
    
    In 1966, Bob Marley went to Delaware to earn money for a planned Wailers 
    label, and Bunny and Peter recruited Constantine Walker to fill his place, 
    recording numerous Wailers sides while Bob was gone. Marley's 
    elevation to iconic status overshadowed Bunny and Peter's estimable solo 
    output, and the Bob-less tracks here show that either one would have been 
    capable of leading the group. The two share lead vocals on the stunning rocksteady tracks ""Who Feels it Knows it"" and ""When the Well 
    Runs Dry"". The harmonies are noticeably sweeter in the absence of Marley, 
    and ""What Am I Supposed to Do"" vies with Alton Ellis's ""Why Birds Follow 
    Spring"" and the Paragons' ""On the Beach"" for the prettiest rocksteady song 
    I've heard.</p><p>
    
    One other remarkable thing about this compilation is the sheer number of 
    songs that don't feature the distinctive Jamaican off-beat accent. Right 
    into 1966, the Wailers regularly recorded straight r&amp;b; and rock'n'roll 
    tracks, and though their version of the Beatles' ""And I Love Her"" 
    (previously unreleased) leaves much to be desired, a number of these songs 
    are fantastic, especially Tosh's Nuggety ""Can't You See"" and the band's 
    outright jaw-dropping version of Dion's ""Teenager in Love"". Indeed, the 
    Wailers continued to record non-reggae songs all the way through their 1970 
    Island debut <em>Soul Rebels</em>, which features a couple of fantastic funk cuts.</p><p>
    
    All these curiosities add up to very solid set, but all of the alternate 
    takes and rarities make it one that's decidedly for fans-- of Marley and early 
    reggae alike. For newcomers, it might be best to start with Marley's 70s 
    material (it's more of a kick to hear the title track of this comp if you 
    already know the version on <em>Legend</em> and <em>Exodus</em>, not to mention U2's ""One"") 
    and work your way to this set via the Skatalites and some Studio One 
    compilations. If you dig that stuff, <em>One Love at Studio One</em> will likely make 
    you very happy.</p></div>"|5674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5674-one-love-at-studio-one/|8.0|Joe Tangari

    name, there's not so much R.E.M. mimicry on <em>Punches</em> as major label
    muscle-flexing. In other words, the album sounds like money, not
    <em>Green</em>. After a slightly more rough and tumble indie debut, World
    Leader Pretend pull out all the stops here, making for vastly layered leviathans that aim even higher than the
    band's name hints-- even the filler tracks enjoy symphonic treatment.
    Nearly an hour of exhausting frippery and fanfare later, <em>Punches</em>
    still boasts its share of hooks and ideas, though sounds impersonal in its
    grandiosity.</p><p>
    Much of this overwhelming effect stems from frontman Keith Ferguson's
    hammed-up vocals, an amalgamation of every headlining Live 8 artist with,
    go figure, a hint of Michael Stipe. Following suit, the band spans the
    breadth of the symphony-rock spectrum. ""The Masses"" and ""A Horse of a Different""
    spin U2 histrionics with hard-edged guitars á la Muse. Creaky pianos usher
    in the verse, Ferguson croons a crooked minor melody and then bam!-- we're
    hit with everything from the Stratocaster to the Stradivarius on an
    all-or-nothing chorus. Funny as they sound on paper, the songs
    surprisingly stick, although some subtlety wouldn't hurt. The title
    track's slick mellotron and sneering guitars could pass as the Walkmen or
    Clinic if not for the instrumental maelstrom crowding every beat
    Ferguson's not singing on. Likewise, ""Tit for Tat"" attempts a bustling
    Sufjan arrangement that sounds goofy enough with sleigh bells and
    xylophone, let alone its relapse into a syrupy Britpop-era chorus.</p><p>
    While noting how <em>Punches</em> misfires on its promise is a bit of a no-brainer, the album's technocratic bent makes for a paper tiger.
    Similar to Portland's Swords, World Leader Pretend pack a
    disproportionately small punch for their expansive sound, their hodgepodge
    of recognizable influences only artificially bolstering the songs'
    effectiveness. To their credit, the music trounces many contemporary
    bands' efforts to make entire albums from ""Boys Don't Cry"".
    Ferguson's songwriting is hyperactive, warding off a repetition of ideas, but there's still a lot of work to be done, and until the trio can muster some pizzazz of their own, they'll
    remain in the shadow of their touchstones-- a shadow they haven't exactly
    shied away from.</p></div>"|8810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8810-punches/|6.5|Adam Moerder

The band stitches together a patchwork of styles-- alternative rock, riff-heavy modern hardcore,  
    ethereal post rock, scream-filled metal-- that don't really  
    blend but instead just seem to sidle up beside one another, varying  
    extensively from track to track. There are powerful moments  
    throughout, from intense bouts of noise and vocal wails, to quiet,  
    serene ambience, but tying it all together somehow makes it seem watered down and banal.</p><p>
    
    The album begins on a dark note with the tribal-esque drumming and  
    mystical guitar of ""The Charm Offensive"". Unfortunately, the vocals  
    are straight out of 90s alternative rock, which is fitting as the song moves through  
    a ponderous grunge groove that the swirling guitars can't quite rescue. ""Heaven  
    Alive"" continues the trend of by-the-numbers rock, with the wah-wah pedal dominating the  
    guitar lines. In fact, the band doesn't  
    really let on that there's more than meets the eye until the first  
    few aggressive seconds of ""A Homage to Shame"". Atonal hardcore blasts  
    segue into a relatively bland verse, but there are more layers  
    working here: Heavy power chords, light, ethereal leads, keyboards,  
    and billowing vocals breathe life into the formula, and by the end,  
    everything has exploded into a chaotic mix of wailing guitars and  
    buried vocal screeches.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, the band breaks through the tedium on both the beautiful ""Music for a Nurse""-- which could be mistaken for  
    Explosions in the Sky's newer material if not for the soft vocals  
    buried throughout the track-- and ""Mine Host"", which is built  
    almost entirely on quiet ambience. The drums sound like they're being  
    piped in from some other world, and vocal repetitions are hypnotic. </p><p>
    
    My frustration, however, stems from how muddled up everything seems. There are  
    tracks that are solid from start to finish, and others that beg to be  
    skipped. Clearly, the band consists of some talented musicians; if  
    only they could focus on the more original aspects of their music.  
    Perfect examples are the album's two final tracks, ""You Can't Keep a  
    Bad Man Down"" and ""Ornament/The Last Wrongs"". These two lengthy,  
    dense tracks build their melodies with layers of instruments, and  
    manage to meld styles into something coherent and powerful.</p></div>"|6122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6122-everyone-into-position/|5.9|Cory D. Byrom

The trio's relocation is sure to be cited as the impetus for the Krautrock-like propulsivity of the resulting LP, but prior to the change of scenery they were exploring this kind of dark percussiveness on 2004's <em>They Were Wrong, So We Drowned</em>. Most listeners had shrugged that album off for its dissimilarity to the band's acclaimed dance-punk debut, <em>They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top</em>, but while hectic, less refined, and at times sloppy, the underrated <em>They Were Wrong</em> marked the shift in direction that would lead Liars to the ethereal gorgeousness of <em>Drum's Not Dead</em>.</p><p>  Highlighted by taut improvisation and frontman Angus Andrew's mastery of falsetto, the record's resolute seamlessness may be attributable to growth through practice: Liars wrote and recorded one album, but, not wholly satisfied with the results, decided against releasing it. Instead, that material was used as a blueprint for what became <em>Drum's Not Dead</em>, and in the process, the band cast off <em>They Were Wrong</em>'s witches and Walpurgisnacht. Granted, there is still a conceptual libretto, this time centered on the universal struggle between confidence and cowardice. These traits are represented by two characters: the instinctive and assertive Drum, and the pessimistic, apprehensive Mt. Heart Attack. Of course, as with <em>They Were Wrong</em>, any conceptual devices remain secondary to the sound and mood.</p><p>  ""Be Quiet Mt. Heart Attack!"" perfectly sets the stage, as fractured guitar waves, opiate military percussion, and Andrew's windswept vocals careen into pitch-shifts which slightly deepen the shadows. Segueing into ""Let's Not Wrestle Mt. Heart Attack"", Liars let forth a siren call that bears an uncanny resemblance to the first few seconds of Faust's ""The Sad Skinhead"", then plunge into bubbling floor-tom/cymbal madness that echoes both Liquid Liquid and This Heat. The percussion is corporeal, tapping into some inner biological timepiece, and as on the album's best tracks, guitar notes are employed only as simple pulsing behind layered, seraphic vocals. Completing the mood-setting opening triad, ""A Visit From Drum"" is linked again by a vocal gasp; a less treated kit accompanies a floor tom/snare and the clattering of sticks for a creepy, mystic sounding incantation. Here and elsewhere, the guitar is an ambient sidekick to high-pitched vocals and tribal drumming.</p><p>  Those first three songs are the album's strongest grouping, yet the excellent push/pull sequencing of <em>Drum's Not Dead</em> creates a shivery cumulative effect that spans the entire length of the record: By its closing notes, you're likely to find yourself awed and emotionally spent. ""Drum Gets a Glimpse"" pairs a mournful Eno-esque melodic sense with cymbal washes, M83 guitar tones, crickets, and Andrew trading lines between the naive and melancholy falsetto of Mt. Heart Attack (""It seems like all our friends have gone""), and the deeper, more authoritative Drum (""You drove them out"").</p><p>  Later, there are a couple of abstract pieces-- fuzzier, looping canyon bliss-outs with left-channel acoustic guitar; a bit of swirling, <em>Sister</em>-era Sonic Youth shredding-- along with a pair of standouts. The first of these, ""Drum and the Uncomfortable Can"", is coated in reverb that amplifies the intensity of the cannibalistic double drumming: It's primal marching band music wrapped in guitar feedback and a howling voice singing about hiding a body. The second comes with the straightforward, closing ballad ""The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack"", which resolves the album at its-- and the band's-- absolute peak. Like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Maps"", its surprise sentimentality lends essential emotional weight, but does so with a dedicated restraint. Gentle guitar drifts accrue density alongside sighing vocals, warmed tom tom heartbeats, tiny instrumental accents (piano, tambourine, roughed-up strings), and Andrew's simple, sweet sentiments: ""I won't run far, I can always be found""; ""If you want me to stay, I will stay by your side.""</p><p>  For added value, Liars flesh things out with an accompanying DVD that presents three visual versions of the album: ""Drum's Not Bread"" by drummer Julian Gross, ""The Helix Aspersa"" by Andrew, and filmmaker Markus Wambsganss' ""By Your Side"". Due to its liberal use of live and studio footage (and farm animals, actually), Gross' best held my attention. More refined, Wambsganss creates effects with light and motion-- his three-channel video for ""The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack"" is his portion's most compelling moment. Maintaining a stoic minimalism, Andrew fixates on a snail's ponderous adventures through Germany.</p><p>  Of course, the music remains the greatest draw. Those who previously yearned for a career trajectory the band wisely ditched ought to listen to <em>Drum</em> and keep track of the epiphanies. In the coming weeks, its strengths will win converts, even among those who'd previously jumped ship. But my favorite detail of this feel-good story-- popular Brooklyn post-punk band falls out of favor by changing directions and ultimately produces an album that eclipses its debut-- is that Liars are still waltzing along on their own terms. This, their third LP, shows zero concessions to the criticisms they received from publications like <em>Spin</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, who awarded <em>They Were Wrong</em> their lowest possible marks. Succeeding rather than regressing or retreating, Liars have had the last laugh: <em>Drum's Not Dead</em> is a majestic victory lap, and on all levels, a total fucking triumph.</p><p> </p></div>"|4767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4767-drums-not-dead/|9.0|Brandon Stosuy

    rotating band of shapeshifters have been called many things: shoegaze,
    dream-pop, Kinks klones. The Philadelphia-based Lilys have
    usually separated their genre leaps by album, with 1992 debut <em>In
    the Presence of Nothing</em> a fine testament to <em>Loveless</em>ness,
    1995's <em>Eccsame the Photon Band</em> a hallucinatory revelation, and relatively more recent work, particularly 1999's <em>The 3-Way</em>, diverging
    into crunchy '60s British Invasion revivalism. Finally, on
    <em>Everything Wrong Is Imaginary</em>, Lilys' various iterations
    coalesce convincingly into a psychedelic quirk-pop summary.</p><p>
    
    If shoegaze is about to become the new garage, as <em>Playboy</em>
    recently predicted (duh, the articles), Lilys may also finally be
    timely. Don't get me wrong: Their latest isn't as cochlea-crushing or
    easily labeled as songs like ""Collider"" and aptly titled ""Tone Bender""
    from the band's first full-length, which hit just as Britpop and
    grunge were dislodging the original shoegaze movement. But the biggest
    differences longtime listeners will notice from 2003's indistinct
    comeback album <em>Precollection</em> are the intermittent detonations
    of vibrato-afflicted volume. On opener ""Black Carpet Magic"", wavy
    guitar noise sears almost distractingly through bright Pernice
    Brothers melodies and Grandaddy-ish electronic sun-splashes. Swoony,
    layered ""Knocked on the Fortune Teller's Door"" leans hard against the
    whammy bar and reveals the album's M.O.: ""I heard your words,"" Heasley
    whispers through clouds of feedback and flute-light vocal effects--
    then thinks better of it-- ""Of course not: your voice."" It's a subtle
    testament to sound on album that both reaches sky-tingling sonic
    heights and scratches occasional gummy shoe-bottoms in its attention
    to subtleties.</p><p>
    
    Again, though, this isn't your older brother's shoegaze. Far from it.
    While the best songs aren't as languid as on the band's subsequent
    <em>Eccsame the Photon Band</em>, they combine the melodicism of that
    album's ""Day of the Monkey"" with the rhythmic denseness of
    <em>Precollection</em>, playing the wall-of-head-liquefaction card only
    sparingly. ""With Candy"" relies on peppy, repetitive hooks, sparkly
    synths and candy-factory overstimulation to distract from a lovelorn
    plea of ""Come back, darling."" The instrumental title track borrows
    scratchy guitars, primitive electronic beats and a bassline one bets
    would look good on a dance floor. But the song that gradually unlocks
    the album's more obscure passages is ""The Night Sun Over San Juan"",
    which despite its Thrills-like title is wistful, edgy pop, with Heasley's
    high wobble at one point evoking Robert Smith. The album swims in
    gauzy details, and this track's weird catchiness floats like a life
    preserver.</p><p>
    
    While much of the record's beauty lies its dizzying production, other songs become submerged,
    emphasizing all-too-vague mood over articulation. ""Still in All the
    Glitter"", with its fractured piano and drunken chord changes, almost
    gets lost in its own veneer. ""Push off who you are/ It's time to go,""
    Heasley sings, but the song hangs onto its swaying drone a minute or
    two too long. So too, ""Where the Night Goes"", with jackhammering
    beats, indiscernible vocals, and guitars that pound boringly where they
    should prod.</p><p>
    
    For all that, <em>Everything Wrong Is Imaginary</em> never quite feels
    like the career-culminating record it should be. ""A Diana's Diana"" bumps to a funky rhythm somewhere between <em>Midnite Vultures</em> and <em>Remain
    in Light</em>, though it's not quite as fun as either masterpiece. More
    successful is witty closer ""Scott Free"" (as in ""This is where I get
    off...""), which clatters with multi-tracked acoustic guitars and
    murderously fey harmonies like the best of <em>Oh, Inverted World</em>.
    Either could represent the next incarnation of a band that, in its
    right turns and (per the album title) its wrong ones, has always
    brimmed with imagination.</p></div>"|4799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4799-everything-wrong-is-imaginary/|7.4|Marc Hogan

Even big guns like Dabrye-- an obvious Eliot Lipp influence-- are sometimes guilty of misplacing their best ideas in the intricate digital corridors of their plentiful gear. Lipp's fluid electro bypasses this pratfall by using a minimal set-up-- mainly a sampler and a vintage Sequential Circuits keyboard-- to create focused, song-oriented bangers leavened with crisp, kinetic shifts. His music is sheer California, blending the Bay Area's cerebral undie-hop into the breezy, whistling G-funk of Cali's mainstream 1990s heyday. As I cast about for a valid critical approach to Lipp's sophomore LP, two distinct vectors present themselves, and the one you favor will determine your overall enjoyment of the album.</p><p> 
    
    The first is purely technical. <em>Tacoma Mockingbird</em>'s rhythmic infrastructure is clean, sharp, and eye-poppingly obvious-- Lipp has publicly stated that he's interested in breathing new life into some of the most overused breaks of all time. As if to drive the point home, he barely alters these famous breaks, usually opting to let them establish rigid skylines under the lurid sunsets of his keyboards. Even if you're bad at recognizing familiar elements when they occur in new contexts, Lipp's beats will be instantly familiar: The creeping skitter of ""Tic Tac""; the elementary snares of ""Times Four""; the syncopated pulse of ""Mashin' on 'Em"". This directness may scan as a cop-out to those of you who actually make beats, which, given the relative affordability and popularity of the technology today, is a significant contingent. Rockist equivalent: One person's hot guitar solo is another's trite reiteration of descending minor scales.</p><p> 
    
    The second approach to <em>Tacoma Mockingbird</em> is aesthetic. This approach is most likely to find purchase with listeners who aren't seriously involved in beat-making, and in light of the rating above, it should be clear which one I favor. The question is whether artists should make music for other musicians or for fans, and while the former can produce results that captivate both sides of the technically-savvy axis, the latter often wins out with the layperson by prioritizing listenability over complexity. Limitations can be artistically fruitful-- it's more difficult to write a fresh-seeming sonnet than to create an open form-- and Lipp's elementary breaks help him to focus the thermodynamic energy of his music, imbuing it with an aura of classic familiarity. </p><p> 
    
    Just look at what happens in these songs, the <em>heirs apparent</em> to Ratatat's accessible blend of hip-hop, rock dynamics and electro-- the vibrant colors that saturate the keys; the intricately braided strands of glossy melody and thick bass buzz that inexorably surge and glide; the nonstop onslaught of memorable hooks whipping precisely around hairpin curves. From the seasick casino-boat stutter of ""Glasspipe"" to the wind-rippled, neon-reflecting puddles of ""Rap Tight"" to the languid squelch of ""Check Weight"", Lipp proves that sometimes, buying shiny new rims is a better approach to reinventing old wheels than tampering with the harmony of form and function inherent in their annularity. </p></div>"|5002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5002-tacoma-mockingbird/|7.8|Brian Howe

Like most winter weekends, though especially this last weekend, the weather in the band's Chicago hometown is cold and unforgiving. It's the time of year when you smile a little less, skip the gym once too often, and stay home cuddling up with your televison more than what's healthy. The M's eponymous debut EP and following full-length were earnest, melodic reclamations of vintage David Bowie and T. Rex, eminently hummable and easy-to-swallow. Both were just a bit timid, however, as if the band was stepping in the footprints of their heroes in the snow, keeping their feet dry. <em>Future Women</em>, on the other hand, is a truck with chains on the tires and a plow on the bumper. It's a dense, ambitious record that finally has the confidence needed to pull of the swagger they've been approximating.</p><p>
    Opener ""Plan of the Man"" gives you a feeling for what's in front of you-- layered guitars, rich harmonies, a dash of horns at the end-- but it barely hints at the quality of the rest of the album. ""Trucker Speed"" is the hook to bring you in, where the band uses every trick in their arsenal. Strings bring suspense to the song's finale, while far-off horns punctuate guitars that lap the sides of the groove like big waves on a small boat. Really, it's really drummer Steve Warsaw working overtime here: Witness a cowbell that sounds like it's actually dangling from a cow's neck, and then the pounding that precedes the song's second half. It starts as a tractor chase, but it soon becomes a high-speed pursuit under the city's elevated train.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, ""Shawnee Dupree"" waves its threatening low-end behind its back while the boys make polite come-ons in three-part harmony, and ""Going Over It"" adds church bells to the corners of its molasses guitar crunch, somehow making it all the more ominous. A well-placed ballad (""Light I Love"") clears the pallette for the hyper-melodic ""My Gun"", where the high notes of a xylophone skitter across the ever-present grinding of the guitars. More familiar pleasures follow, like the swaying title track, the horn-laden rave-up ""Mansion of the Valley"", and the starry-eyed closer ""Darling Lucia"".</p><p>
    It's well-tread ground the M's are bounding across; you'll hear far-too-familiar barrel-roll piano on ""Never Do This Again"", and you can see in your head the pained faces the guitarist is making for some of these licks, on the second return of ""My Gun"" and elswehere. But the issue isn't dodging cliché, it's how well you can swing it. The M's have found a canny chemistry out of seemingly simple parts (three-part harmonies plus a powerhouse drummer), and now, they've got swagger to spare.</p></div>"|5677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5677-future-women/|7.6|Jason Crock

    accents has yet to yield a truly U.S.-conquering icon. Maxïmo Bloc
    Heads may set Pitchfork-scribe hearts a-flutter, but they're still as
    unlikely to play in Peoria as the late-60s Kinks, let alone Morrissey
    or Pulp. The statesiders who'd most
    appreciate the emo underpinning Arctic Monkeys' precocious tales of
    bars and bouncers can't even drink legally. And Art Brut, they're
    still import-only. The Kooks take elements from their up-and-coming
    peers and a name from <em>Hunky Dory</em>, achieving an adolescent
    universality that's at once their strongest pitch and greatest
    failing.</p><p>
    The Brighton-based quartet fill their debut <em>Inside In/Inside Out</em> with
    almost enough exuberant choruses to make up for their more generic
    failings. Standout ""See the World"" and first single ""Eddie's Gun""
    bristle with the straightforward dynamism of <em>I Should Coco</em>-era
    Supergrass. Follow-up ""Sofa Song"" mugs Strokes skuzz for an attempted
    hookup. Even as mellower tracks like ""Ooh La"" or ""Naive"" find an
    uncomfortable meeting point between the Verve and Eagle Eye Cherry,
    their singalong hooks are hard to hate. The acoustic pop of ""Jackie
    Big Tits"" is far more charming than its title suggests. ""You only go
    around, round, round,"" sings Luke Pritchard, his Casablancas-choked,
    thickly accented melodies translating thanks to sharp melodies and
    common themes.</p><p>
    Ah, but common also has a pejorative sense. Fast and furious third
    single ""You Don't Love Me"" lacks its predecessors' catchiness, while
    the shimmying verses of ""Ooh La"" resort to faceless bromides: ""It's a
    hard life to live/ So live it well"". It's unclear why opener ""Seaside""
    is acoustic and drumless, aside from youthful overconfidence; ""I'm
    just trying to love you,"" Pritchard complains. His oft-repeated
    thoughts on romance don't get much more novel on the band's sojourns
    into the umpteenth-wave ska also practiced occasionally by the Arctics
    and fellow Brits the Paddingtons, such as the stuttering ""Match Box""
    or awkwardly political ""If Only"".</p><p>
    The Kooks' keen grasp of the banal isn't the only factor keeping them
    from a distinct personality. Between bouncy Britpop, angst-ridden
    acoustic anthems, red-light skanking, ""Hounds of Love"" oh-oh harmonies,
    and the Delta blues intro to ""Time Awaits"", it's not clear the Kooks
    know who they want to be when they grow up yet, either. Weaker
    atmospheric tracks like ""I Want You Back"" and the closing ""Got No
    Love"" suggest the Kooks are best when they're focused instead on
    brash, catchy, preferably witty pop. True, the provincial focus of a
    band like Arctic Monkeys may make their songs difficult exports. By
    contrast, though, being universal doesn't have to mean being
    impersonal.</p></div>"|4605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4605-inside-ininside-out/|5.9|Marc Hogan

When the Bad Seeds provide a backdrop against which Cave's tales of woe can play out, the results-- from <i>Tupelo</i> through <em>Abattoir Blues</em>-- are inimitable and so compelling that one can easily forgive their pretensions. But Cave's faux-Faulknerian novel, <em>And the Ass Saw the Angel</em>, strode defiantly into the realm of the ridiculous and there defended itself against such literary niceties as setting, character, credibility, and restraint. <em>The Proposition</em>, the movie based on Cave's screenplay about bushrangers in late 19th century Australia, doesn't open in the U.S. until late spring, so it's understood that reviewers like me have had no chance to determine how the music is used in the film. But the casting is impressive (Guy Pearce, Ray Winstone, and Emily Watson) and the story sounds like an intriguing device for exploring his usual themes of betrayal and redemption. Already <em>The Proposition is being heralded as a violent epic, which might suggest that Cave has indulged his every Gothic whim. But exactly where this movie falls between silly and sublime is anyone's guess, at least for a few more months.</em></p><p>
    
    The soundtrack gives nothing away. Cave co-wrote and performed these tracks with Dirty Three violinist and occasional Bad Seed Warren Ellis, and the music ranges from the intimate to the epic, from the understated to the overblown. Most of the songs are small and so particular that you can almost discern a story from them. ""The Proposition #1"" establishes an ambient background against which Ellis' violin scratches out a ragged melody, evoking some nocturnal conspiracy full of twisted menace. And the shuffling rhythms and windblown percussion of ""Banyon Road"" (title notwithstanding) suggests an arduous journey, while the creeping bassline implies the danger of reaching the destination. Elsewhere, Cave and Ellis set fluttering piano and swirling violin against a flat drone, evoking the wide-openness of the Australian range and the isolation-- emotional as well as geographical-- of the characters who inhabit it. Rumbling noises suggest peril, and blasts of guitar feedback act out sudden violence. Overall, it's a tense listen that suggests a tale full of suspense and blood.</p><p>
    
    That sense of sonic narrative helps the soundtrack stand on its own apart from the movie, but doesn't excuse its indulgences. While Ellis's violin sounds as purposeful here as it did on the Dirty Three's best work-- particularly <em>Horse Stories</em>-- Cave's vocal contributions seem generally superfluous. On songs like ""Down to the Valley"" and ""Clean Hands, Dirty Hands"", he gently sings lyrics that sound like they were made up on the spot, which is odd considering the movie has been gestating for nearly a decade. On ""The Proposition #1"", ""Down to the Valley"", and ""Moan Thing"", he moans plaintively over the music: As a one-off performance, it's fine, but as a motif repeated over songs, it's grating.</p><p>
    
    Featuring Cave's most prominent contributions, four tracks called ""The Rider"" should be the soundtrack's centerpiece, but instead they revel in brash overstatement. Cave sings softly, but still manages to sound overwrought-- the riders, he intends, are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. His lyrics do him no favors either: ""'When?' said the moon to the stars in the sky,"" he sings on ""The Rider #1"". ""'Soon,' said the wind that followed him home. 'Who,' said the crow that started to cry. 'Me,' said the rider as dry as a bone."" </p><p>
    
    Ultimately, in the canon of rock soundtracks to Westerns, <em>The Proposition</em> falls somewhere near the middle. It's easily better than Bon Jovi's contribution to <em>Young Guns II</em> and even rivals Joe Strummer's recently reissued soundtrack for Alex Cox's <em>Walker</em>, but it's not even in the same league as Neil Young's noodly soundtrack to Jim Jarmusch's <em>Dead Man, Dylan's </em><em>Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid</em>, or-- the top of the mountain-- Altman's use of Leonard Cohen in <em>McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</em>. Still, by making the intimate seem so epic and the quiet so loud, <em>The Proposition</em> soundtrack should at least intrigue listeners enough to see the film.</p></div>"|1373.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1373-the-proposition-ost/|6.0|Stephen M.

Witness the ferocious Stax-thumped steel of <em>Nova</em> or the midnight funk of <em>Rhythmatism</em>. They're eminently organic records, arranging unkempt percussive bursts into cohesive swarms of soul and noise. It's a bit bizarre then to see the 62-year-old legend collaborate with Four Tet's Kieran Hebden, a high-tech bricoleur of electronic whispers and scratches. The teaming represents one more attempt to fuse physicality and virtuality, nature and machine, chaos and process, and all those other tired dichotomies that electronic artists feel obligated to address.</p><p>
    The unconventional partnership began on Steve Reid's superb <em>Spirit Walk</em>, which generated a clutch of formidable live gigs and a two-album series, starting with <em>The Exchange Session, Vol. 1</em>. Sadly, a brief preview on a Gilles Peterson comp (""Knives and Forks"") made the duo seem destined for disappointment, articulating every cliché in innocuous techno-jazz: dull blips, tepid fills, sterilized synthesizers. When it tried to capture a Steve Reich-like blend of jazz and gamelan, the piece seemed unable to gain any traction. The music seemed listless and uneven, as if the union were merely suggested by some perplexed record exec.</p><p>
    Impressively, Reid and Hebden occasionally manage to combat these tendencies on their full-length debut. Sure, there are stereotypical motifs in the mix-- chipper birdcalls, brushing effects, tinny turntable maneuvers-- but it also has some remarkably gorgeous passages, brimming with Reid's fuming vitality and Hebden's electronic ingenuity. On ""Morning Prayer"", drums bristle in front of crinkled mounds of funk and shrill pulsations. It's both calm and vaguely menacing. In recent years, Reid has further tempered his improvisations with forays into West African rhythms, and Hebden ably assists by including reverential allusions to <em>daqqa</em> and <em>baayo</em> discord.
    In the longer pieces, Hebden's competence is severely tested by Reid's subtleties. Patchy digital fades seem either sporadic or restrictive, and the middles tend to muddle or fall into rote repetition. Of course, there are still lengthy moments of inspiration: The synthesized fragments of ""Electricity and Drum"" drain through Reid's cymbals and link with drilled reverb, filtered radio frequencies, static, and swirling fax bleeps. These passages are often elegant but, unfortunately, they make more tedious moments all the more obvious.</p><p>
    In general-- and despite passages of extreme beauty-- something seems amiss on <em>Exchange Session</em>. There is neither symmetry nor dissymmetry in the performances, as if both musicians were trying to pass by one another and kept colliding instead. Unlike a true alliance, Hebden and Reid seem to be playing two separate performances simultaneously. Under the right circumstances, this could make for a tense, dramatic recording. Instead, it often feels merely neglectful. If the album is one of Reid's attempts to move jazz forward within an electronic context, it demonstrates neither dazzling innovation nor complete mastery. At the same time, there is enough here to prove that both musicians have been (and are) great innovators within their respective genres. The sum is somehow less than the parts, but the parts are still invaluable.</p></div>"|3170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3170-the-exchange-session-vol-1/|6.8|Alex Linhardt

His age (a disarming 22), preeminent fondness for gauzy synths, and continued close affiliation with Border Community-- now sort of the Green Party of techno labels-- have reinforced that caricature, but its been his gradual shift away from the sturdy rhythms of early tracks like ""Outhouse"" in favor of the facemelting sounds of ""Dynamo"" and ""The Sky Was Pink"" that have cemented the image.</p><p>
<em>Drowning in a Sea of Love</em> marks Fake's long-awaited debut LP, and sees him complete the transformation from 4/4-friendly house producer into the prog prince of nu-IDM. Where his singles once comprised long, rolling stretches of gravel road rhythms, there's barely a beat to be found here, and what few there are bump less like thunderstorms than metronomes, existing as cursory structures rather than focal points.</p><p>
    
    It's a drastic change, but it's not necessarily for the worse. Texturally, <em>Drowning</em> recalls both M83 and Morr Music's cutesy cadre of melody-happy synthpoppers, but where the former often feels too rich for consumption and the latter too relentlessly sweet, this strikes a perfect note somewhere in between. It's one of the lightest, easiest records I've heard in a long time, a low-calorie pleasure that makes up for what it lacks in gut-level punch by never seeming to diminish in returns. </p><p>
    
    ""Superpositions"", ""You Are Here"", and ""Long Story"" are all shoegazer-inspired tracks that begin as embers and finish as forest fires, and ""Bawsey"" is a beautiful, decaying, minor-key piece that might as well have been swiped right out of Boards Of Canada's textbook, but it's the swoonsome ""Charlie's House"" that stands as the album's highlight. Beginning with a crisp rhythm track and a glowing, circular arpeggio, it takes on a haunting, dusky quality about a minute in, when Fake introduces his favorite sound: the same yawning, mournful synth that made the original incarnation of ""The Sky Was Pink"" (which gets a workmanlike remix elsewhere on the record) such a revelation.</p><p>
    
    Holden's remix of ""The Sky Was Pink"" was one of my favorite techno tracks of last year, if not ever, and his shadow looms large over this record as well. I might just be projecting what I know of the back story onto the material, but despite having formally moved away from house music, it still often feels like Fake is setting the table for-- or at least overtly tempting-- the remix. Maybe that's why early reviews of this have been just as likely to lump it in with house as with IDM, because there's a certain spirit to what Fake does that can't be erased simply because the backbone has been. Regardless, he's got such a beautiful, producer-ly touch that we should be happy with whatever record he wants to make, so long as he's making them.</p></div>"|3360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3360-drowning-in-a-sea-of-love/|8.4|Mark Pytlik

    out of the band,"" mocked Brendan Fowler, aka BARR, on his recent debut album,
    <em>Beyond Reinforced Jewel Case</em>. Turns out he was actually singing about former
    Measles Mumps Rubella vocalist Brett Patrick Lyman, who parted ways with the
    group following disputes about which direction to focus their sound and
    ambition. New vocalist Chuck Bettis who, like the band's other three members,
    moved to New York from Washington, D.C., fronted outfits
    such as the Metamatics, Trance and the Arcade, and All Scars. Bettis's clipped bark-- flickering effortlessly between the frenetic beats and driving sizzle of
    keyboards-- sounds like a natural addition to the group's ambitious
    soundscapes, which have become lengthier and more expansive since their last
    release, <em>Fountain Of Youth</em> (Troubleman).</p><p>
    
    At times echoing their former label mates Erase Errata, Measles Mumps Rubella flourish in the prickly, disjointed space between instruments,
    while encouraging fluid patterns to emerge organically from this tension. One of
    the best examples is on ""Hollow Bodies"" when an oscillating
    keyboard rhythm drops down to spar with an anxious, relentlessly fast hi-hat
    drumbeat. Bettis' vocals also have
    their own rhythmic quality, and the effective interlock of lyrics and breathless
    panting and hissing on the album's opening track, ""Algorithm Of Desire"",
    creates a dovetailing mayhem of fricative cadences gradually smothered by delay
    and pools of itchy fuzz.</p><p>
    
    Although it would be possible to square off Measles Mumps Rubella as another New
    York dance-punk band snapping at the heels of !!! and Out Hud, there is a dark
    and almost psychedelic undercurrent to the group's momentum that steers them
    away from becoming too imitative of that style. <em>Fantastic Success</em> is colored by
    a compelling energy and determination, and this is where the record's
    strongest qualities lie. One suspects that Measles Mumps Rubella's relatively
    slow start in releasing a debut album-- their first 7"" came out four years
    ago, on their own Malady imprint-- and the hurdles overcome in the process of
    losing a founding member and having to re-track all of <em>Fantastic Success</em>'
    original vocal lines with Bettis, has much to do with this. There's an audible
    <em>need</em> in this music-- a desire to release creative ideas left simmering for
    practical reasons. For this reason, <em>Fantastic Success</em> gleams with an ardent
    energy that provides the perfect platform for Measles Mumps Rubella's shadowy,
    polyrhythmic fury.</p></div>"|5678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5678-fantastic-success/|7.9|Mia Lily Clarke

Without the bark and 
    personality of an MC to elevate or mangle his music, it'd be rather simple 
    for an album as quiet and unassuming as Ayatollah's <em>Now Playing</em> to 
    fall away into the ether. Created without fuss, the longtime Queens-based 
    hip-hop producer's official instrumental debut (the underground hit <em>So 
    Many Reasons To Rhyme</em> was never officially released) is an efficient 
    album full of downbeat, soul-laced songs. But it's certainly a curio 
    from an accomplished, if too sporadically working musician. Ayatollah's 
    best-known work-- ""Mos Def's ""Ms Fat Booty"", Styles P and Pharoahe Monch's 
    <em>Soundbombing</em> collaboration ""The Life""-- would fit well here. But that 
    begs the question: Why didn't dude just sell some of these beats? The music would work as a backdrop, but there isn't a clearly defined theme to this 
    competent if tangential set of songs.</p><p>
    
    The reason lacks rhyme, I guess. Many of the songs seem to be designed 
    specifically for vocal accompaniment. The elegiac ""Hold U"" (originally from 
    Masta Ace's <em>Disposable Arts</em>) glides a bit oddly into the ragga-tinged 
    ""Kingston"". The whistle-n-moan ""Devil is Sweet"" would work for any number of 
    Rawkus'd exiles (Kweli comes to mind) or as the requisite end-of-album, 
    somber track for a maje label second-tier soliloquist like Lloyd Banks. Instead 
    it just juts out-- a fine, uncomplicated record in a sea of them. ""This 
    Song Is Over"" samples the same track from <em>Who's Next</em> 
    (not sure how he cleared that sample) and sullenly summarizes much of the 
    album's mood. Ayatollah has his somnabulic bounce down cold: mix two parts 
    well-chopped soul loop with one part breakbeat; add synth for ominous 
    juxtaposition.</p><p>
    
    This is not to diminish the tact it takes to craft something like this, 
    something that cleverly leaves gaps for the chorus and drops snares out for 
    big punchline punches. But <em>Now Playing</em> works in opposition to 
    contemporaries like Rjd2's <em>Deadringer</em> or Blockhead's <em>Downtown 
    Science</em> or even Dilla's recent <em>Donuts</em>, which traded hooks for beat 
    schizophrenia. Those guys embraced the spotlight, for better or worse, in 
    the absence of someone shouting over their track. Ayatollah, perhaps with 
    the exception of the rim-rocking ""Go For It"", is cool with hanging in the 
    background, even when he's right up front.</p></div>"|501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/501-now-playing/|6.9|Sean Fennessey

No sooner had <em>Destroyer's Rubies</em> leaked to internet file-trading services than rumors (credited, as these things always are, to ""reliable sources"") began to spread that the album was to receive a perfect score from this publication. It wasn't until I actually sat down and gave <em>Destroyer's Rubies</em> a few good listens that the aptness of such a rumor really hit me: The album is structurally complex, thematically dense, and labyrinthine in its self-referentiality. Dan Bejar's vocals are, like many of his indie contemporaries, yelpy and dramatic, and many of his lyrics seem preordained to serve as mp3 blog headers. In other words, the qualities that once made Destroyer albums so ""difficult"" make <em>Destroyer's Rubies</em> a perfect record for this critical moment.</p><p> Writing about Destroyer has proven to be, to borrow a quote from Bejar himself, ""a playground for fun."" Destroyer reviews have an unfortunate tendency to read like essays written for college seminars. Bejar's writing seems to lend itself particularly well to analysis as a ""text,"" often resulting in reviews that focus exclusively on the referentiality of his lyrics. But, while listening to <em>Destroyer's Rubies</em>, I think many writers-- myself included-- have been missing the point. At its core, Destroyer is an almost unfashionably conventional (or, as Bejar would say, ""classical"") project. Bejar writes well-crafted pop/rock songs that, for all their lyrical complexity, tend to be about people (usually girls) and places he knows. The obtuse character of Bejar's lyrics strikes me not as a <em>Waste Land</em>-esque shot at epic intertextuality, but rather a simple refusal to write things that will make sense to everybody. If more singer/songwriters wrote lyrics without stopping to explain every single reference, or reducing their thoughts to poetic-sounding generalities, Bejar's lyrics might not seem so impenetrable.</p><p> Yet, while some have been busy puzzling out every reference in every Destroyer song, Bejar has been quietly and consistently honing his craft, putting out albums that are uniformly strong but thoroughly unique in their musical sensibilities. Though 2001's <em>Streethawk: A Seduction</em> stands as his most concise and catchy record, 2002's much-maligned <em>This Night</em> was a triumph in its own right. With more-reverb-than-guitar guitars, more-fill-than-drumbeat drumbeats, and choruses that mostly consisted of ""ba ba ba"" or ""la la la,"" Bejar recast musical excess as the core and foundation of a surprisingly solid rock album. With 2004's <em>Your Blues</em>, he dabbled in flamboyantly theatrical vocals and canned MIDI instruments, committing two of the very few aesthetic crimes that might have effectively dismantled the substantial buzz that was building around Destroyer.</p><p>  Which brings us to <em>Destroyer's Rubies</em>, Bejar's seventh, and best, full-length as Destroyer. The album's nearly 10-minute self-titled opening track makes clear that whatever Bejar may have lost in terms of precision he has made up in versatility. Structurally, ""Rubies"" is remarkably sophisticated, cycling through several mini-verses but never congealing into any standard song form. Built around a few simple themes, ""Rubies"" covers a great deal of ground both musically and emotionally as Bejar's characteristically serpentine melody carries him through careening guitar hooks, military snare drum fills, and a strikingly spare acoustic guitar finale. The endlessly catchy ""Painter in Your Pocket"" opens with a similarly stark acoustic guitar intro, then unexpectedly builds up more bounce and swing than any Destroyer song to date. By the time the song reaches its final chorus, it has attained a blissful, sing-songy energy that hasn't really graced any Destroyer record since <em>Streethawk</em>.</p><p> The success of epic songs like ""Rubies"" and ""Painter in Your Pocket"" owes a great deal to Bejar's development as a singer. While <em>Streethawk</em> is considered by most fans to be the best Destroyer record, Bejar's vocal performance seems stifled and flat in comparison to <em>Destroyer's Rubies</em>. On <em>Your Blues</em>, Bejar's substantial growth as a vocalist was more or less entirely obscured by the record's synthetic accompaniment. But over the course of <em>Destroyer's Rubies</em>, Bejar coos, hisses, and snarls with uncharacteristic confidence. He's always had a knack for unique phrasing in his melodies, and his newfound expressive range greatly enhances their impact.</p><p> Unfortunately, the album does falter a bit toward its end. ""A Dangerous Woman Up to a Point"" substantially outstays its welcome, ultimately coming across like a half-assed rehash of ""Looter's Follies"". ""Priest's Knees"" is sorely lacking in melody, and probably could have been omitted altogether. The album's closing track, ""Sick Priest Learns to Last Forever"", pushes the bar-band-from-hell aesthetic a bit too far, and winds up living up to its name in a rather unflattering manner. Given the generally high quality of the songs on <em>Destroyer's Rubies</em>, these bouts of sloppiness come off as particularly frustrating.  But while <em>Destroyer's Rubies</em> is by no means a flawless record, its most glaring flaws are for the most part mercifully self-contained. Encapsulating and elevating the best of Destroyer's back catalog, <em>Destroyer's Rubies</em> serves as a potent reminder that the intelligence of Bejar's songs has never obfuscated their emotional weight.</p></div>"|8970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8970-destroyers-rubies/|8.5|Matt LeMay

Anglo techno megalopolis Warp made the Newcastle quintet its highest-profile guitar-band signing, testing waters they've also populated, however gingerly, with prog-punk instrumentalists Battles and vegetal folkies Gravenhurst. The band's first single for the label, ""Apply Some Pressure"", became its first UK Top 20 hit; when the track was reissued eight months later it became its fourth. This startling fortune made absolutely no sense. Maxïmo Park are a pop band lacking pop music's crucial feature: its immediacy. <i>A Certain Trigger cloyed before it joyed; yes, it was a grower. I'm convinced that had partly to do with the way the band recorded the album. Favoring muted dynamics and fat, diffuse guitar and drum sounds that belied the music's rhythmic intensity, they leavened and prolonged what could've been a sugary hit-and-run. <em>Missing Songs</em> has my back on this one: late-album inclusion ""Apply Some Pressure (Original Demo Version)"" is basically a note-for-note reading of the souped-up album version sans ProTools filters and expensive microphones, and it's a different song for it.</i></p><p>
    So it goes with this collection. The songs don't wow, but neither did/does <em>A Certain Trigger</em>. Rather, ""A19"" and ""My Life in Reserve"" slowly chisel brains, overcoming underwhelming sonics to bang blithe melodies. Just as on the debut, singer Paul Smith exercises an English probity that starts boring and ends up either charming or still boring, depending whether or not you have the time. The courtship is just slower with these cuts, the payoff smaller. Few tracks on <em>A Certain Trigger</em> can claim a moment as strong as ""My Life in Reverse""'s crude, uneasy bridge, but timid performance stifles the drama; the passage wants more measures and double the strength from its toilsome, chugalugging guitars. Give ""I Want You To Leave"" thinned-out guitars and a drier, denser drum sound, you've got Futureheads-potent punch. Instead the track, <em>Missing Songs</em>' most rhythmically sophisticated, feels scattered and one-dimensional. ""Stray Talk"" fails to exploit the promising tension in its stiff-strummed breakdown, surrendering resolution too quickly and easily.</p><p>
    Those are the tracks worthiest of a re-rendering-- i.e., could ship off to a control room for grooming and undergo mods to occupy deep album slots. Others would require few tweaks at all. ""Fear of Falling"" facilitates Smith's best vocal performance by giving him least primacy, instead nearly toppling <em>A Certain Trigger</em>-single ""Graffiti""'s monopoly on transcendent, heavy triplet outros. ""A19"" wins for best shameless use of cheesy oscillating guitar FX, the perfect terrible-is-awesome complement to an overeager hook. Album nadir, a cover of John Lennon's ""Isolation"", mercifully aborts mission after 74 ticks. Here Smith's voice ceases to convey sweet, slightly sarcastic indifference, rather coming across achingly precious. If your range is monotone, noncommittal is always better. Such miscues and the inherent lousiness of B-sides and early cuts collections notwithstanding, <em>Missing Songs</em> is the rare curio that actually inspires curiosity.</p></div>"|5647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5647-missing-songs/|6.4|Sam Ubl

    It's so hard to be a tastemaker, you all have no idea. Sure, it's probably tough to be a doctor or a
    soldier or a fireman, but really, when you think
    about, being a tastemaker is probably the most
    difficult occupation of all. It's such a drag having
    to wade through all that music, year in and year out,
    to find the few diamond needles in the overwhelming
    publicist-baled haystack. Then, of course, there's
    the grueling seven-day holiday retreat where the ruling
    council meticulously puts the releases into proper,
    absolutely completely scientifically objective order. 
    Finally, you release your definitive year-review to
    the public, and all the ungrateful plebes can do is
    hysterically bemoan the omissions and nit-pick the
    standings. Christ, people, how do you think we run
    things here, some kind of ""democratic"" poll?</p><p>
    
    Our friends at the Rough Trade record shops surely
    understand our pain. The UK's highest-esteemed record
    store, Rough Trade also carries the
    heavy burden of the tastemaker, looked to by a thirsty
    world to choose what choice music was worth saving
    from the previous year before it drifts off into foggy
    memory. For four years, the record shop has
    obliged with a two-disc compilation summing up the last
    calendar year, a sort of record-store-guy-to-go
    package of the tracks and bands you weren't cool
    enough to already know about.</p><p>
    
    At 50 tracks, the Rough Trade clerks certainly had
    plenty to endorse in 2005, and the selection sprawls
    across the full inventory of genres...that aren't hip-hop. 
    Unlike the loose freak-folk/dance-punk
    disc-segregation of the 2004 edition, <i>Counter Culture 05 is more of a
    mixed bag, appropriate for a year that didn't have a
    clearly definitive underground movement to feign bored
    embarrassment about in two-three years' time. Deftly
    avoiding the dangers associated with ranking, the
    organization of </i><i>Counter Culture 05 is dictated purely
    by aesthetic flow, which, when you're dealing with a
    collection that includes both Jandek and Franz
    Ferdinand, is no small task.</i></p><p>
    
    In its guise as a guide to the best work
    of 2005, many usual suspects appear: Low and
    Sleater-Kinney, Boards of Canada and Matthew Herbert,
    The Fall and Elvis Costello (with the Brodsky Quartet,
    for additional geriatricity). Unsurprisingly, Rough
    Trade's rookie discoveries closely parallel those of
    this here humble webzine in places, with the store
    also buying into the horrible-name/awesome-band trend
    headlined by Serena Maneesh, Test Icicles, and the
    band with the clapping and the Yeah-saying.</p><p> 
    
    But <em>Counter Culture</em>'s best use is as an early
    warning system about UK groups that
    haven't quite hit the radar yet in the colonies, like
    the surprisingly authentic 60's-psych-pop of Modlang, girl-group revivalists the Pipettes, What's Your Rupture signees Long Blondes, or Katzenjammers,
    a band that-- trust me-- is represented by an
    excellently gritty steel-drum interpretation of Gary
    Numan's ""Cars"". The second disc goes on to shine a
    spotlight on the slept-on Pixies-cowpunk of Brakes
    (Rough Trade's #1 album of 2005), and shows that
    spastic new-wave revival is in full flight with

    The desire to comprehensively document the best of
    2005's obscure and exotic (that aren't hip-hop)
    occasionally leads <em>Counter Culture 05</em> to trip up on
    songs completely out of step with the compilation's
    edgy young-people tone: the throat-singing of Albert
    Kuvezin and Yat-Kha, for instance, or the kids' home
    recording project of Street Gangland Rhythms Band 1. 
    Such inconsistency can be expected to plague any
    compilation with goals as ambitious as the <em>Counter
    Culture</em> series, leaving it more useful as a sampler
    than as a continuous listen; an appetizer for further
    research, not a main course. In this manner, this collection serves the noble mission of the tastemaker,
    graciously pointing the way towards the Promised Land
    of cool bands. I know your struggle, Rough Trade, and
    I salute thee.</p></div>"|2092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2092-rough-trade-counter-culture-05/|7.2|Rob Mitchum

    You'd expect two guys as in love with sound as Norway's Espen Sommer
    Eide and Dag-Are Haugan to have a lot of tapes lying around. For this
    late 2005 release, the two men of Alog were asked by the Oslo-based
    Melektronikk to assemble the best of their odds and ends. The result
    is this 13-track collection, which, though not exactly new, have
    been heard by almost nobody. Included are a couple of previously
    released remixes and scattered bits from small-run EPs and singles,
    but they're probably new to you unless you're reading this from
    Tromsø.</p><p>
    That a skim of the archive can produce such an interesting record says
    a lot about the value of the Alog project. It's all over the place,
    and it shouldn't hang together, and yet it does. Alog called
    their terrific 2005 album <em>Miniatures</em>, but the title would have been
    more apt for this release. Ten of these selections are under five
    minutes; such restraint is a rarity in the world of abstract
    electronics, but it works wonders when dealing with this level of
    variety. Each track is a small world unto its own, with a unique
    palette and structure. Alog get in, lay out the rules, make their
    statement, and get out, wasting not a note and leaving you wanting
    more.</p><p>
    The highlights rank with their best work, and, in one case, with
    anything I've heard in a long while. The treasure for me is ""Song Sung
    Inwardly"", a highly abstracted reconstruction of material sampled from
    Italian electro-pop group Slow Motion. It's gloriously accessible
    pop/noise, oddly song-like, with alternating beams of fuzzy drone that
    suggest a chord progression. It takes a shoegazey turn when high,
    harmonizing voices (or brilliant mechanical facsimile thereof) waft
    in, like a couple of Wilson brothers trapped in the guts of the
    machine and trying to sing their way out. At only 3:30, I've no choice but to repeat it endlessly.
    </p>
<p>
    But blissed-out drone is only part of the story here. If there's a
    consistent thread, it's Alog's playfulness, their light touch
    and wry humor that can occasionally veer toward the twee. ""Just
    Recording"" begins with sleigh bells and prayer bowls, but the cloud of
    incense is pushed out with a weird chorus of clipped, percussive
    vocalizations from a mixture of kids and adults (it was apparently
    recorded at a children's school using the facilities instruments on
    hand). ""Something Like Islands of Memory"" sounds like something from a
    Tomlab release, with its dreamy backward guitar mixed with a woman's
    laughter garbled in a faulty tape machine. ""Hej, Vart Blev Det Av
    Dat'en, Kim?"" (""Hi, where did the DAT-tape go, Kim?"") lays the
    answering machine voice of Norwegian producer Kim Hirothøy atop a
    recording of his entire CD being played on fast-forward, so that the
    50-minute album is heard in four. Screwing around, you say? Maybe, but
    always with a sense of purpose, and with ears wide open.
    </p>
<p>
    Obviously, given its castaways and cutouts nature, <em>Catch That Totem!</em>
    isn't all brilliant, but even the lesser tracks hold my interest. I'd
    finish by saying that the inspiring sonic imagination of Alog deserves
    a much bigger audience, but a couple weeks ago they picked up a
    Spellemann Award <em>Miniatures</em>. Their website
    explains that a Spellemann is a ""Norwegian Grammy."" Now that's my kind
    of country.

They come at you with blustery post-punk <em>and</em> easygoing Peach State twang all at once, one vocalist (Eric Friar) coughing clenched half-syllables, the other (Sheryl Branch) honoring the homeland in silken diphthongs. Percussive clatter, wormy synths, shrill interlocking guitars, and sax skronk play musical chairs around lots of really interesting melodies. Clearly this trio has studied its Jawbox and Burning Airlines LPs, taken additional cues from Smart Went Crazy, the Dismemberment Plan, Les Savy Fav, and Giddy Motors, and simplified those sources to a basic linear geometry. The Athens thing is a red herring: Except a brief spate of ethereal vocal harmonics on ""A Nice Haircut"" and some of Branch's backup singing, nothing here bespeaks a psychedelic indolence. <em>Plague Dogs</em> reaches even further back into the 90s for its frissons.</p><p>
    
    What, because we're into the second half of this decade bands can start cribbing from the second half of the last? If they do it as confidently, creatively, and playfully as Heros Severum, I say let 'em go nuts. <em>Plague Dogs</em> weatherstrips sorta-obscure vestiges of late 90's indie rock, reminding us of when syncopation was cool and J. Robbins recorded every fourth album. Whereas Robbins' projects tended to spotlight thick, sludgy/funky bass, Heros Severum do without the instrument altogether. When your drummer's as good as Davey Staton, having a pared-down (read: one man) rhythm section is emancipating, like Little Timmy losing his training wheels. Staton performs many tricks, including limber open stroke rolls (""3kh2"") and dizzying tom-kick whirligigs (""And Introducing""). Guitars prove their chops by keeping up, weaving polyrhythmic formworks. Near-constant vocals give direction to the cosmology, but some songs satisfy a wanderlust through hypnotic call-and-response vamps. In other words, Heros Severum are the kind of band that could list ""jam band"" on Myspace for larfs and wouldn't be lying entirely.</p><p>
    
    Dare you to call their bluff, but the could-be-joking bits function as well as humor-- even when they essay smarmy rap slang. ""And Introducing..."" first practices less-is-more around the vocal, drawing focus to Branch's jive talk (""Got a chicken neck, coke bottle, broken back spine/ Better watch it, man, 'fore I whoop your behind""), then, as if to contraindicate such use of singsongy hip-hop affect, the band let rip on some intricate kicks, words ousted by floating vowel sounds. Friar's lyrics are uniformly terse and nonsensical; he sings like he lacks the breath for more than one or two syllables at a time. The style enables him to issue galvanizing rally cries, which sound more meaningful than they probably are. On ""Sick Dog"", at what may be the album's apogee, he screams fearlessly, ""Can't keep a brother down,"" over molten sax blurt. ""A Nice Haircut"" asks, ""Were ya raised proper?"" (like this is a band to talk!), then schools in skeletal groove, tamped down tight and shot from Gang of Four's stiff-is-the-new-loose bazooka. Heros Severum are obviously not the first to use levity as a foil against what's at heart complex and quite measured songwriting, but they've made it the crux of a surprisingly fresh record.</p></div>"|4034.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4034-plague-dogs/|7.9|Sam Ubl

Though Conrad himself doesn't appear on Town and Country's sixth album <em>Up Above</em>, his creative influence is felt acutely throughout, as the group deliver what is by far their most vigorous and diverse collection to date. Rigged with an assortment of obscure folk instruments (Japanese shakuhachi, Moroccan guimbri, Chinese khaen) and with a newfound emphasis on vocals and percussion, Town and Country here perform within an expansive, pan-ethnic cosmology that's been barely hinted at on their earlier albums, managing a surprising number of ecstatic peaks along the journey.</p><p>
    
    On previous releases like 2003's <em>5</em>, Town and Country's minimal, real-time excursions could terminate in pieces so static that they often appeared inert and featureless, like helium-filled aircraft lacking the sturdy framework necessary to transport passengers. Here the group's directional shift is immediately evident on the opening ""Sun Trolley"". Following a brief fanfare of chimes and droning reeds, the piece nods respectfully to Conrad with an abrupt solo of saw-toothed viola before again shifting into an homespun gamelan maze of mouth harp, sitar, and hand percussion. It's an introduction that may come as a small revelation for those familiar with the glacial, soporific modulations of Town and Country's past work, but even so does little to prepare the listener for the vibrancy of Up Above's multi-hued performances.</p><p>
    
    Primarily recorded during summer 2005 in group member James Dorling's Chicago apartment, the album nevertheless captures the open space of some distant Silk Road tributary. On tracks like ""Phoney Fuckin Mountain"" or ""Fields and Parks of Easy Access"", Town and Country recall some of the casual East/West unions of Popul Vuh's <em>Hosianna Mantra</em>. Elsewhere, the percussive likes of ""Cloud Seeding"" or the plucked strings of ""Bee Call"" can so resemble composer Tan Dun's film scores that you'll be on the lookout for shadowy martial warriors leaping across the rooftops.</p><p>
    
    Conrad's influence is felt again on ""King of Portugal"", a dense improvised psych-drone based upon a traditional Portuguese Christmas carol, with Dorling's semi-wordless vocal providing additional cryptic overtones. The set culminates with the nine-minute title track, a volcanic free-form ritual that scatters the album's many gilded threads to the four winds, along with all thoughts of placid minimalism. As with the rest of <em>Up Above</em>, this trance-inducing mini-epic is remarkable for its variant textures and periodic bursts of dissonance, neither of which have figured much in Town and Country's past work. As such, the album does rather muddle the group's ongoing identity, but hopefully future releases can serve to confirm this album as the watershed it now appears to be.</p></div>"|8124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8124-up-above/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

With titles like ""Hong Kong"", ""Tapei"", and ""Pan Continental"", <em>Nomad Junk</em> is a electronic pastiche of traveling and cultural tourism. Fittingly then, opener ""Jamboree"" feels like a slow ride on a moving walkway into a glamourous foreign airport. Robinson wraps a few thin notes of guitar around a cracking drum loop, the atmosphere thick like humid air, and a climbing acoustic guitar figure unfolds over it all with Zeppelin-esque grace. ""Hong Kong"" breaks a bouzouki riff to pieces over stiff, unforgiving drums and Robinson's sound effect library: shooting lasers, ringing telephones, and far-off flute whistles.</p><p> 
    
    The pan-global restlessness is underlined by ""Can't Lie Down"". One of <em>Nomad Junk's few non-instrumental tracks, Robinson takes a fanciful vocal turn over single strums of guitar and happily bubbling synth tones. Playfully speak-singing on one line, mumbling on the next, it aptly turns distraction and noncomittance into playful pop. Heavy vocoder on the brooding ""Taipei"" pushes the album further onto the dancefloor.</em></p><p>
    
    Momentum is lost in the second half, and the mariachi guitars in ""Pan-continental"" are a bit too obvious signifiers for the title's suggestion. While the album is well-paced and transitions smoothly from track-to-track, it all sounds somewhat dated. I assumed that came with the return-to-form territory, and Capitol K had to risk irrelevance to return to his roots (or at least his best material). But no; breaking out <em>Island Row</em> again, it still sounds fresh, tearing apart rhythms and slathering distortion on fearlessly. It's <em>Nomad Junk</em> that plays it safe. It treads the same territory as <em>Island Row</em>, but even its best tracks are a tourist's surface glance instead of a new insight.</p></div>"|1293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1293-nomad-junk/|6.7|Jason Crock

    resides in San Francisco. Hudson Bell also happens to be the name of 
    the three-piece band that he fronts. <em>When the Sun Is the Moon</em>, 
    the band's third album, is a nostalgic blend of acoustic 
    balladry and fuzzed-out guitars. It's a somewhat unexpected 
    combination, but one that here is full of warmth and emotion as Bell's dry vocals and charming melodies weave throughout each 
    song, blending indie pop with psychedelia in a way that sounds at 
    once fresh and familiar.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Slow Burn"" spends almost two-and-a-half of its 
    eight minutes bellowing distorted guitar. Instead of heavy 
    power chords, it's more of a drifting fuzz, a quality that colors much 
    of the album's lead guitar work. Throughout the record, the tempo and tones hardly waver, creating a consistent mood throughout. The band mixes dusty southern-style rock 
    with breezy pop on ""The Falls"", and ""Seven Cities"" shuffles along 
    with layered vocals and drunken, ethereal guitar leads. Another 
    highlight is ""The Midnight Year"", which begins as upbeat and bright before it's sounds give way to church bells 
    and droning guitar fuzz. Soon everything fades, and lapping ocean waves and chirping birds introduce the song's second 
    movement, a contemplative, slow-picked instrumental, complete with 
    lonesome harmonica wails.</p><p>
    
    At seven songs in under 40 minutes, <em>When the Sun Is the Moon</em> 
    at first appears a bit slight. But three of the tracks clock in at 
    well over seven minutes, and the nostalgic, sentimental feel to the 
    music seems to stretch it somehow, making the album feel longer than 
    it is. Closer ""Sea Horse"" utilizes quiet organ drones, 
    lush guitar strumming, and soaring vocal harmonies to bring 
    everything together, and, along with ""Slow Burn"", bookends a rich, 
    delicate album. </p></div>"|4033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4033-when-the-sun-is-the-moon/|7.4|Cory D. Byrom

    band's palpitating heart is drummer Jeff Scheven. His beats are so sturdy 
    you could tie just about anything to them and it'd sound okay. His basic 
    stock in trade is the epitome of ""dance-punk,"" with plenty of 
    hi hat on the upstroke, kick drum on all fours, and crackling snare fills. 
    The rest of the band picks up more on the dance and less on the punk half of 
    his approach-- bassist Ronnie Morris has clearly listened to some disco, and 
    guitarists Scott Kaija and Colwyn Llewellyn-Thomas alternately lock in with 
    the rhythm section and ride it.</p><p>
    
    The band's debut EP, 2004's <em>History</em>, was a tight package of urgent 
    rhythm and catchy melody. A 
    full-length gives the band a chance to develop, but 
    unfortunately the format also gives them more room to stray from their core 
    sound, highlighting that they're not as good at slower songs as 
    they are at break-neck floor stormers. ""Rooms"" in particular feels 
    ponderous, weighed down by heavy riffing and a lack of buoyancy, and the 
    little electronic interlude that follows isn't really doing them any favors 
    either.</p><p>
    
    God, that sounds awful, doesn't it? As much as I hate to rain on a band's 
    attempts to diversify its sound, though, my ears and the various parts of me 
    that like to dance say the discofied barnstormer ""Magnetic Strip"" and 
    throbbing opener ""Tigers Not Daughters"" are where it is for 
    Controller.Controller. Basnayake's clipped, deadpan alto loves to hug a 
    groove, and she's at her melodic best on ""Heavy as a Heart"", where she 
    syncopates her vocal across the groove, dueling with some blister-fingered 
    lead guitar. Toward the end of the song, a few of her male band members join 
    in for some surprisingly Fleetwood Mac-ish harmonies, and it works really 
    well. ""Poison/Safe"" is the best cut on the record with its tense, airless 
    verses, barbed wire guitars and stunning groove, the bass line holding 
    steady as the guitars change chords around it.</p><p>
    
    Controller.Controller's first album is an overall solid effort, and at its 
    best it's capable of inducing a nervous twitch in even the most sedentary 
    listener's legs. There are no individual songs as bracingly vital as 
    ""History"" and ""Sleep Over It"" from on the EP (though ""the Raw No"" recycles 
    part of the former's melody at about thirty fewer beats per minute), but 
    those are an admittedly high benchmark. <em>X-Amounts</em> doesn't fully deliver on 
    the <em>History</em> EP's promise, but it should be enough to keep the Toronto band 
    on the map.</p></div>"|1769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1769-x-amounts/|7.1|Joe Tangari

    Less like a singles comp than an album ex-post-facto, <i>Western Store</i> resequences 11 tracks (all culled from five EPs, some pre-dating <i>Rest</i>) out of chronological order.  Perhaps this explains a few notable absences, like <em>where's the fucking bonus disc of Müller's genius remix work</em> (in which he both out-freaks Ricardo Villalobos and out-funks Recloose)-- or indeed whither few non-Playhouse productions and remixes, like his florid International Pony rework or his heartstopping, breaks-based ""It's About"" from Freundinnen?  But these are quibbles; if <i>Western Shore falls short of definitive, it's deep enough to display Müller's range-- and, perhaps more importantly, offers a sufficiently unorthodox take on electronic body music to convince all those indie critics who Pazz &amp; Jopped </i><i>We Are Monster into the top 50 to take another look at the Playhouse back catalogue. House is a feeling, and the way Isolée gropes his way through it, eyes closed and twitchy fingertipped, should be enough to lure the staunchest four-to-the-floorphobes into the dark corners behind the kick drum.</i></p><p>
    A convoluted doc, <i>Western Store opens with the hesitant, bewildered off-rhythms of someone stumbling back from the wilderness. It's an interesting bit of narrative revisionism, given that ""Bleu"" dates from Isolée's third, not first, Playhouse 12"", but it's a smart move, pulling together in one stroke machinic, Säkho-styled techno, up-front house rhythms, and the pinging dub of Rhythm and Sound, as if to banish techno's conventional timelines altogether. With ""Initiate II"", the disc dives into the cavernous vocal house of Luomo, but Müller's garish Rhodes and itchy hi-hats jerk against the soporific effects in a way that Luomo's never do.</i></p><p>
    These aren't, actually, the disc's best tracks; those would be the quartet from Play 018, the EP also titled <i>Western Store: ""Rockers"", ""Surfers"", ""Simone Rides"", and ""King Off"". Despite a low-slung electric bassline, ""Rockers"" has nothing to do with rock'n'roll-- nor with reggae, for that matter. A tin-can and fingersnap percussive jam, it's a virtual blueprint for, well, almost every current track in a Wighnomys vein, right down to the use of reverb as an instrument. Every drum has its own little pocket of airspace and a frequency so unique you could tune a radio to it. ""Surfers"" plays with the same ideas, but with some detuned chords starts to explore the sickly melodicism of </i><i>Rest, while ""Simone Rides"" and ""King Off"" creep further into the humming darkness. </i></p><p>
    These tracks show a taste of Isolée to come, as he begins kinking up his fishing wire, throwing weird little hooks-- neither verse nor chorus nor bridge-- into otherwise solidly ""tracky,"" non-songlike constructions. ""Cité Grande Terre"" may open as a traditional dub-techno track, but the doubletime crackle and anxious bass bumping beneath might as well be part of a different song altogether; once again, Müller's doing the work of the DJ ahead of time. The one-and-a-quarter minute ""Poisson Mort"", similarly, sounds like what you might get if you fast-forwarded through <i>Rest at 16x.</i></p><p>
    By ""Lost"", which equips the early years' clatter with enormous, pie-in-the-sky Pink Floyd melodies, jazz chords, and Detroit techno balladry, the <i>Monster inside begins to stir. Segue giving way to segue, this is where the </i><i>Rest author gets restless and gives free rein to all the hooks and riffs and meta-motifs swimming around in the soupy innards of his sequencer. It's not easy listening, but that's ""Beau Mot Plage"", the unexpected breakaway hit that got Müller licensed by a thousand ""shitty"" (his word) Ibiza comps. Who knows why Playhouse went with Freeform Five's Latin-jazz ""Freeform Reform"" (which was comped more often than the original anyway); the tinselly electro original isn't just more appropriate an inclusion, it's better-- no less breezily Balearic than the remix, but simply lighting the beach with a phosphorus tide line instead of sweeping halogens, the better to illuminate, in the most natural way, Isolée's most unnatural approach to spinning glassy strands out of granulated blips.</i></p></div>"|4163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4163-western-store/|8.2|Philip Sherburne

You'd think after all the Zappa/Waits/Beefheart darts thrown his way after the band's 2004 debut, lead singer Honus Honus would cut the gravel shtick-- the stache, too. Instead, he seems to have bought all three's entire discographies over again, zeroing in on Waits' freak empathy, Zappa's klezmatics and turnarounds, the Captain's sense of surprise. We know <i>exactly</i> what he's building in there. In the process, though, Honus lost his former bandmates, and possibly a lot more. This big-top ringleader whose barely prophetic ramblings and nauseous yelps we delighted in last time around as mere entertainment now asks us to move closer, listen not to the sounds, but to the songs-- the pleas for help.</p><p>
    I didn't expect people to dig <i>The Man in a Blue Turban With a Face</i>, same reason I wouldn't drag them to Deerhoof or put a plastic snake in their drink as a joke. Unfocused and sloppy and more of-the-moment than of-the-whole, that record was possibly the polar opposite of what some people value musically. This time out, Man Man's less sloppy but just as ramshackle, as if the snaps and crackles are the band's diversion from actually writing the record. As a song and title, the breakneck ""Young Einstein on the Beach"" might be more self-referential than the band intended.</p><p>
    They're still tending to the same changes, the same high-pitched call-and-response tropes, and the waltz time, and those parts can blur together a bit. But plenty of good moments pop out by relation: that ""mous-tache mous-tache mous-tache"" breakdown on ""Push the Eagle's Stomach"" with video game power-up sounds as the retrigger, the song's ""So What"" ending, the guitarless Sabbath
    riffs, the weird keyboard sound halfway between ""96 Tears"", and the noise made when two rubber Little Caesars dolls are scrubbed together. Or take the accordion melody on ""Banana Ghost"", or the dozens of great lyrical turns, such as on the appropriately sparse ""Skin Tension"" (""Let down my guard/ And there goes my heart/ Straight out the window again""), or on ""Black Mission Goggles"", something of a misfit toy remake of ""Come Together"" (Beatles, not Annie): ""She's a warm bodega/ High on Noreaga,"" Honus shouts, thus giving Jens Lekman a run for his rap ref rep.</p><p>
    Just so you know, the line after ""Noreaga"" is this: ""Strung out in Brooklyn cos I love her."" Happens a lot here: The fun stops, the façade is dropped for a split second, and suddenly Man Man's circus act isn't nearly as interesting as the tension of them maintaining it. That push/pull is why <i>Six Demon Bag</i> sticks so much more than the last. Granted, the band relies on the same structure for most of these moments-- percussion drops out, locker-room singing, then the sober line-- but damnit can they do sober: ""You should always run with a loaded gun in your mouth,"" or, ""When the night breaks, and the clouds shake, and your hopes ache, to someday be redeemed,"" or, ""I know I'll never be the man that she thinks she really needs/ But it don't stop me from trying to be.""</p><p>
    Despite/because, Man Man's most focused song here is also their most debilitating. On ""Van Helsing Boombox"", Honus hums and whistles along to the bell hook, delaying himself from articulating the actualities of a breakup: learning ""how to speak a forgotten language"", wanting ""to sleep for weeks like a dog at her feet,"" falling in the street and howling at the moon. Think of the man you most admire-- your father, maybe-- then remember the first time you saw him cry. The song hits like that: broken and embarrassed and yards of dirt more convincing than your Glibbards and Blight Eyes.</p><p>
    Why ""Van Helsing"" works so well as an album track, though, is it really heightens the sudden change of heart on closer ""Ice Dogs"": Starts stubborn (""Am I supposed to close my eyes as you walk away from me?"") but how quickly that old love again comes back-- chirpy horns, girl group shoo-wops, smiles for smiles. It's pathetic. It's fantastic drama, too-- rare for any work, let alone a fucking rock album, to pull off so well in 40 minutes. ""C'est la vie/ Don't abandon me/ When the bridge burns down and the bad blood tastes like wine."" Punch-drunk and happy for now, but it's still blood.</p></div>"|5622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5622-six-demon-bag/|8.3|Nick Sylvester

    basically pointless, peripheral details you've probably heard
    a couple of hundred times by now. There's the Montreal mailing address, the cluelessly offensive name, the awkward hairy-fairy nude photos, and the fact that Wolf
    Parade's Arlen Thompson helped record the eight tracks that make up
    the official debut (though they spelled his last name wrong in the
    liner notes). More impressive than geography and failed shock value is
    that half the group, Special Deluxe and Hiroshima Eye, moonlight as
    the well-regarded anarchic screen-printing graphic designers, Seripop.
    Visually AIDS Wolf exhibits that same sly Seripop aesthetic acumen.
    Musically, not so much.</p><p>
    Until now, the quartet's put out a split 7-inch with the Fugue and a
    bunch of limited, cassette-only releases. So why the fuss? On a
    generous day, the sound's a decades-late take on Teenage Jesus &amp; the
    Jerks or a boring revision of the more recent Chicagoan no-wave of the
    Scissor Girls. I cheaply affix those not-quite-right examples because
    of AIDS Wolf's female vocalist, but the tempos are more
    comparable to split-at-the-seams Arab On Radar and a less technically
    apt Flying Luttenbachers. That the kids have been together since April 2003 but remain embroiled
    in such generic misfires is indicative of the band's priorities.</p><p>
    I'm a sucker for musical insistence, so I like opener ""Spit Taste Like Metal"" for its guitar jabs, spiraling tiny
    little needles in your ears. But even when the guitars are
    entertaining, Special Deluxe's super thin howls are placed at the
    center. (At times, she's wisely placed back in the mix.) The guitars
    themselves sink once it's clear the same line of attack is repeated
    from song to song to song. By track four, ""The Hat Collector"",
    the tediousness is grating and by the album's close, you've completely
    forgotten that they're playing. Following standard album composition
    tropes, the last track, ""Some Sexual Drawings"", lasts almost 12 minutes, as compared to the seven one- to two-minute blasts before it.
    (All said, the album's under a half an hour long.) For the grand magus
    they dig in and explore, but no more than any noisy-minded posse would
    cobble together if you handed 'em some instruments and asked 'em to rock.
    Please come back, Harry Pussy, noise needs you.
    </p><p>
    The formula? Wailed vocals, jaggedly angular guitars, tumbling drums,
    and pinball ricochets. A major technique pairs escalating rhythms
    mixed-up with Special D's increased vocal agitations: It's like the
    band's always building and never arriving anywhere, though rather than
    slyly confounding expectations, it's just lazy. Ultimately, the
    posturing that scored AIDS Wolf pre-release press may also lead to
    their undoing. It's clear the wild-child rhetoric surrounding the
    release of <em>The Lovvers</em> LP is an attempt at selling chaos as a
    lifestyle-- god, it's really hard to buy into this stuff when each
    shard feels incredibly calculated. As performance art the stuff's suburban and
    tame; as music it's weak, but if AIDS Wolf gets anywhere it won't be
    the first (or last) time style's trumped substance. It is surprising,
    though, that supposedly astute music fans can be force-fed such
    watered-down pablum when it's well packaged. The blogs and boards are already wondering whether it's rock or if it's noise. Maybe it's a joke? For now, let's just call it shit in wolf's
    clothing.

In the late 60s and early 70s, progressive rock was not only critically acclaimed, buy actually cool, at least to hipster intelligentsia. It was still just a part of psychedelia, acid rock, or any number of things not stigmatized by people who might later look back in anger-- in fact, much like how Animal Collective, Liars, and Deerhoof are somehow ""indie rock"" today even when they might just as well represent new genres altogether. Yet, it didn't take very long for conventional opinions to change-- perhaps only two or three years-- when many listeners and critics jumped ship for more fashionable seas (and probably not coincidentally, ones that would ultimately run ashore at punk and New Wave at the end of the 70s).</p><p>
    
    Why did this happen? I have my theories: many prog bands left ""the people"" behind in some respects, opting for longer songs, out-er experiments, and flashier performances; the apparent demise of the dreams of the 60s meant that utopian ideals of enhanced consciousness and experimentation fell by the wayside to make room for suitably rawer, rougher sounds; progressive politics of the time (and to this day) dictated that social and economic elitism disabled a big chunk of society, so when you're playing music that takes 10 years of education and a healthy bank of equipment to produce, it doesn't exactly scream ""populism."" Of course, even in the best, most well meaning scenarios, a ton of great music got brushed over. Luckily, a lot of this stuff is being rediscovered today, as digital music communities and the information silo of the internet are helping right a generation of wrongs.</p><p>
    
    British DJ, producer, Twisted Nerve label boss, and rabid vinyl collector Andy Votel compiled <em>Prog Is Not a Four Letter Word</em> from what must be a massive collection, and makes clear what many a die-hard prog fan will tell you: If you think you know all the faces of this music, you've got another thing coming. Sampling bands from all over the world, his set makes a pretty good case for progressive rock's diversity, as well as its ample potential for DJs looking for new breaks. The music here almost completely eschews flashy solos and epic song-suites in favor of a very psychedelic flavor of prog, with jazzy touches and an almost melancholy aftertaste. As with his <em>Folk Is Not a Four Letter Word</em> comp, I suspect he had an agenda in mind of challenging assumptions about the genre, and for better or worse, he succeeds.</p><p>
    
    Italian band Picchio Dal Pozzo leads off the set with ""Merta"", and makes immediately clear that this will not be a wizard's cap run-through. Forming a drone out of bells, acoustic guitar and a moaning synth line that wouldn't sound out of place in a Lindstrom track, the song is gentle and mystical, like opening the door to a wild, yellow garden. Likewise, French composer (and Serge Gainsbourg associate) Jean Claude Vannier's ""Le Roi Des Mouches"" uses an Eastern-tinged orchestral arrangement, peppered with hand drums and acoustic guitars to make exquisite chill music, the kind that would go perfectly with just a touch of incense and something a bit less legal. English proggers Egg (featuring players who would go on to form signature Canterbury bands Gong and National Health) drop a version of J.S. Bach's ""Fugue In D Minor"" that recalls not the warmed over ELP-style classical gas, but the pastoral psych of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"". Bands like Germany's Embryo and French artist Phillipe Besombes demonstrate similarly subtle takes on jazz fusion.</p><p>
    
    Of course, as a sometime prog-geek myself, there are choices I'd have made differently. Ultra-obscure Welsh act Bran play quaint art song on ""Breuddwyd"", but why choose this when there are so many better examples of chamber classical influences in prog (e.g., Renaissance, Slapp Happy, even Magma)? Also, songs by San Ui Lim and Czerwone Gitary barely seem like prog to my ears, rather closer to sub-<em>Nuggets</em> folk rock and something way too close to a Foghat jam, respectively. In truth, there is an aspect of cratedigging here at the occasional expense of truly incredible tunes; it's a shame, because slightly better known (and frankly much better) bands like Lard Free, Supersister, Moving Gelatine Plates, early Soft Machine, Brainticket, and Plastic People of the Universe would have fit in perfectly.</p><p>
    
    Still, it's difficult to nitpick much. <em>Prog Is Not a Four Letter Word</em> is nice on its own terms, and I'm all for opening doors to a ripe canon of music unjustly maligned. Seek and you shall find: There's more good music out there than jaded hipsters and critics might let on.</p></div>"|2114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2114-prog-is-not-a-four-letter-word/|7.5|Dominique Leone

But then, as the Chicago backwoods balladeers' engrossing second album attests, dying is easy; it's the living and loving part that brings trouble.</p><p>
    
    The punchline to <em>All the Love I Could Find</em> is, unfortunately, ""not a whole lot""-- and the love Salveter <i>does</i> find is only legal in certain Southern states. His absence-makes-the-heart-go-flounder despair is reflected in the band's skeletal arrangements, which assume the
    sunstroked stumble of Crazy Horse (c.f. ""Cortez the Killer"") and the Dirty Three's desert-dragging dirges. And standing in for Neil's signature one-note leads and Warren Ellis' weeping violin is an equally distressing instrument: Salveter's distinctive vocal, a death-bed confessional tremble that doesn't so much suggest a lump in his throat as a tumor.</p><p>
    
    Like his cow-punk patriarch Jeffrey Lee Pierce, Salveter is by turns petrified and cocksure, and never at a loss for sly, self-effacing witticisms: The solipsistic chorus to ""You Can't Help Those People"" at first sounds almost self-parodic (""Ain't nobody's troubles like mine/ I had no other girl on my mind/ The one I wanted was a crime""), but the smirks turn to shock as those words assume a more disturbing context next to ""Cousin"", a collaboration with Kelly Hogan that sympathetically chronicles an affair between relations in uncomfortably intimate terms (""I'd wake up at night to watch you pissing"").</p><p>
    
    Though the band insists that many of these songs are based on real-life experience, Salveter's narratives often obscure the line between reality and myth. As reflected by the album's uniformly languorous gait, the only certainty here is misery, and at times, being dragged through this chasmal bleakness can seem endless: ""Torture"" crawls along for an agonizing seven minutes, but merely states the obvious: ""I'm feeling blue/ There's no seeing you."" But despite such lows, the rousing ""Cause of It"" reaches an extraordinary peak, as Salveter reveals his deepest truth: ""I want it, I want it to feel/ Like Sam Cooke or Patti Labelle."" And in a way, he succeeds. Through his public suffering of separation anxiety, guilt, shame, and a broad-ranging spectrum of other unpleasant emotions, <i>All the Love I Could Find</i> itself becomes Salveter's very real salvation: He feels how he does so we don't have to.</p></div>"|5001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5001-all-the-love-i-could-find/|8.1|Stuart Berman

Appropriating conventions only insofar as they can be subverted, observing tradition only to comment upon the triteness of observing tradition, indie rock is a circuit-breaking shunt disrupting the transmission of heritage that's hardwired into genres such as blues, jazz, and even rock. Instead of tapping into a particular lineage, it tends to pull whatever flapping loose ends dominate the moment into its vortex, inscribing a narrative that begins and ends with its author's experience. If Broken Social Scene is the epitome of indie rock, with its slapdash collective aesthetic, muzzy mélange of songwriting styles, and predilection for abstracting rock until its solid historical thump becomes gaseous and hermetic, then BSS guitarist Jason Collett's solo work is an escape valve venting his pent-up traditionalist urges.</p><p> 
    Unlike his first solo album <em>Motor Motel Love Songs</em>, which, as a collection of Collett's early self-released material, was justifiably spotty, <em>Idols of Exile</em> is consistently solid; the songs are fully realized and, ultimately, memorable. Its melancholy yet optimistic worldview and bucolic charm strongly evoke the Band, another group of Canadians toying with the mythology of the American south, and its combination of this sensibility with more spectral touches aligns it with Wilco's <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em>. The most significant area of overlap between Broken Social Scene and Collett's solo work is his coarse yet mellifluous voice, which, in this stripped-down context, reveals itself as a formidable instrument, confident and nuanced, capable of complex volleys of blue notes and monolithically soaring choruses.</p><p> 
    Predictably, <em>Idols of Exile</em> is fleshed out by a revolving cast of Arts &amp; Crafts regulars. Amy Millan and Kevin Drew contribute harmonies to ""Fire"", which uses grandiose symbols to allude to basic longings, a shivering synth and a variety of chiming rhythmic elements buffeting Collett's voice as it breaks like Jeff Tweedy's: ""I know you just want to be on fire."" Standout track ""We All Lose One Another"" opens with an echo of Smashing Pumpkins' ""Disarm"", then a rolling wave of acoustic guitar, violin, and piano carries Collett's vocal toward a triumphant chorus. Leslie Feist sings back-up on the crunchy country stomper ""Hangover Days"", and Apostle of Hustle's Andrew Whiteman embroiders its rude fuzz-bass with prickly electric guitar solos. Over the course of <em>Idols of Exile</em>, the classic rock idiom that Collett helps to dismantle with Broken Social Scene is reassembled piece by piece. The record humbly takes its place in history's queue: Perhaps not what BSS fans are looking for, but, weighed against the impulse for continuity instead of disjunction, deeply satisfying. </p></div>"|1737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1737-idols-of-exile/|7.6|Brian Howe

    imaginative childhood soundtrack, it's apt that they claim to have met in the Casio keyboard department on the fifth floor of London's premier toyshop, Hamleys. This curiously humorous and bold debut album from UK native Alisdair Stirling and Bergen-based composer/producer Jorgen Traeen conjures up images of rickety funfair rides, bustling amusement arcades, and the familiar, tinny spark of early 90s Super Mario bonus levels. Although occasionally congealing into a molasses-thick clog of processed beats and frivolous superflouites, for the most part <em>Toy</em> retains a magical charm. The variety of animated textures and samples sound like a dusting of icing sugar over what would otherwise be little more than an oddly infectious foray into lo-fi techno.</p><p>
    As their name implies, Toy tend to create their music using instruments
    specifically designed for children. That these seemingly ""naïve"" or
    ""primitive"" sounding materials are being employed by two widely respected
    musicians-- Traeen is the guy behind Sir Dupermann and runs one of Norway's
    best recording studios; Stirling plays in the Bergen collective House of Hiss and Sensible Twins-- really makes this record work. By approaching what could be seen as a limited selection of instruments to make their soundscapes, Stirling and Traeen are encouraged to use their musical initiative to wring all potential out of them. And they do. On tracks such as ""Realistic Martian Landing Set"", happy-go-lucky beats mix with the abrupt fuzz of distorted Casio bleeps and heavier piano tones to form distinctively bizarre trails of sounds rich with visual imagery. It sounds like the soundtrack to a B-movie sci-fi flick. There are also some especially effective moments, such as the addition of toy xylophones and reverb at the track's close, which leaves a glistening flicker of notes that sound like ice spilling over marble slabs.</p><p>
    Not all of Toy's influences are woven from childhood knick-knacks, however.
    There are also strong echoes of Japanese electronica like Cornelius and
    Zongamin, the atmospheric, bleeding dub of Silver Apples, and even the
    scuffling, muscular rhythmic tension of groups like Tussle. Although Traeen and Stirling's creations cast a loose net in terms of musical variety and ideas, their sound is very specific and unlikely to appeal to a wide audience. Toy's characteristically playful melodies could be interpreted as a whim in danger of turning into a one trick pony. But like many ambitious and eccentric projects, one is left with the feeling that this is unique enough to carry them into further fields of experimentation.</p></div>"|8313.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8313-toy/|7.2|Mia Lily Clarke

It     means you don't find it a sell-out move to commission     remixes from that ""Music Sounds Better With You"" guy     and his buddy. Post-hardcore means occasionally     sounding like a video game. It means you don't always     have to be putting your vocal cords in mortal danger,     though an old-fashioned primal scream still has its     time and place. Post-hardcore means it's alright to     release three singles from one album.</p>
<p>These are all things I've learned from listening to     Test Icicles, and though ""post-hardcore"" may not be a     wholly new or particularly accurate classification,     it's how I'm hearing this London act's     distinctive aesthetic. The trio never seems to     stretch far from music that's     aggressive, but at the same time are eager to apply the     occasional spacey synth, dial down the vocals, and traffic in     rhythms that do strange things to people's lower     bodies. In their pop/scream dichotomy, Test Icicles     remind me of Braid, another band that was once     referred to as post-hardcore, but a Braid that has     lived through the recent vogue of dance-punk without     becoming completely cynical about its potential.</p>
<p>Here then, to coincide with the recent stateside release of     their inconsistent yet promising full-length <i>For     Screening Purposes Only</i>, is a run-down of the band's     three EPs-- one a U.S. release, the other two UK singles. One serves the role of hype harbinger, an     effective primer for the various angles the band     covers at this embryonic stage. The other two show     the band's willingness, like their big brothers in     Death From Above 1979, to submit their music to     revision by dance producers, a practice I'm pretty     sure Minor Threat never indulged in.</p>
<p>Lead single ""Boa vs. Python"" is packaged with one track that also landed on the album, plus two that remain exclusive to this EP, and it serves as fitting introduction to the band's rambunctious     sound. The tone on the title track is     heavier than most of what's to be found on <i>For     Screening Purposes Only</i>, but any threat of the band     maintaining their scary pose is undercut by a playful     garage-rock organ. ""All You Need Is Blood"" also seems vaguely threatening at the start, but doesn't take off until     the band slips into a hi-hat driven groove and     Advantage NES-riffing. ""LMNO Hoes"" is a jokey     speed-core throwaway, but ""What's in the Box"" reveals     the band's Brainiac heritage in satisfying fashion,     nailing the mini-Moog squiggles and hysterical     delivery better than most Timmy Taylor disciples.</p>
<p>The other two singles are remix-heavy and fall into the category of     ""for fans only,"" each sporting a pair of     makeovers that run the full gamut from stunningly bad     to bizarrely, fascinatingly bad.      ""Circle. Square. Triangle"" is the better of the two     source materials, but suffers the greatest disservice,     including an endless, recasting     that reaches new valleys with a (hopefully)     tongue-in-cheek MC endorsing ""techno-math-rap is the     best."" The blander ""What's Your Damage?"" draws in the     bigger names, with Digitalism turning in an     evil-sounding treatment partially undone by the     defanged slow tempo, while Alan Braxe &amp; Fred Falke     whip up an absurd juxtaposition of New Romantic     keyboards with the original track's throat torture.</p>
<p>All these outside influences, then, provide repeated     proof that Test Icicles are usually better off     trusting their own instincts. The best moments on <i>For     Screening Purposes Only</i> manage to hit just the right     mixture of sounds-- hardcore diversified by synth     intrusions and dance-punk given a more dangerous     sheen. It's a balance that's thrown off by these attempts     to reorganize the components. As such, only the     isolationist ""Boa vs. Python"" fairly represents the     promise Test Icicles and the current iteration of     post-hardcore have to offer.</p></div>"|11856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11856-boa-vs-python-circle-square-triangle-whats-your-damage/|7.7|Rob Mitchum

In their pop/scream dichotomy, Test Icicles     remind me of Braid, another band that was once     referred to as post-hardcore, but a Braid that has     lived through the recent vogue of dance-punk without     becoming completely cynical about its potential.</p>

One serves the role of hype harbinger, an     effective primer for the various angles the band     covers at this embryonic stage. The other two show     the band's willingness, like their big brothers in     Death From Above 1979, to submit their music to     revision by dance producers, a practice I'm pretty     sure Minor Threat never indulged in.</p>
<p>Lead single ""Boa vs. Python"" is packaged with one track that also landed on the album, plus two that remain exclusive to this EP, and it serves as fitting introduction to the band's rambunctious     sound. The tone on the title track is     heavier than most of what's to be found on <i>For     Screening Purposes Only</i>, but any threat of the band     maintaining their scary pose is undercut by a playful     garage-rock organ. ""All You Need Is Blood"" also seems vaguely threatening at the start, but doesn't take off until     the band slips into a hi-hat driven groove and     Advantage NES-riffing. ""LMNO Hoes"" is a jokey     speed-core throwaway, but ""What's in the Box"" reveals     the band's Brainiac heritage in satisfying fashion,     nailing the mini-Moog squiggles and hysterical     delivery better than most Timmy Taylor disciples.</p>
<p>The other two singles are remix-heavy and fall into the category of     ""for fans only,"" each sporting a pair of     makeovers that run the full gamut from stunningly bad     to bizarrely, fascinatingly bad.      ""Circle. Square. Triangle"" is the better of the two     source materials, but suffers the greatest disservice,     including an endless, recasting     that reaches new valleys with a (hopefully)     tongue-in-cheek MC endorsing ""techno-math-rap is the     best."" The blander ""What's Your Damage?"" draws in the     bigger names, with Digitalism turning in an     evil-sounding treatment partially undone by the     defanged slow tempo, while Alan Braxe &amp; Fred Falke     whip up an absurd juxtaposition of New Romantic     keyboards with the original track's throat torture.</p>
<p>All these outside influences, then, provide repeated     proof that Test Icicles are usually better off     trusting their own instincts. The best moments on <i>For     Screening Purposes Only</i> manage to hit just the right     mixture of sounds-- hardcore diversified by synth     intrusions and dance-punk given a more dangerous     sheen. It's a balance that's thrown off by these attempts     to reorganize the components.

Like the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds, they idolized Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, and Bo Diddley, among other black American performers, and the Animals even shared a stage with Sonny Boy Williamson. Singer Eric Burdon also had the voice to sell the sound: sandpaper-raw, effortlessly loud, and, like Mick Jagger, intimately lewd, as if every lyric contained some potential double entendre. But the Animals were never as big, as good, or as dangerous as the Stones, and throughout their career they walked a fine line between the pop that made hits and the r&amp;b; that ostensibly warranted respect.</p><p>
    
    On their 1966 album <em>Animalism</em>, they indulge their white-soul jones more heavily than ever before, and the songs-- mostly covers-- volley between the derivative and the inventive. Hip-O Select's minimum-fuss reissue contains no bonus tracks and no involved repackaging, which actually works well for this material: With the short liner notes relegated to the back panel, this new version preserves the shape of the album and the layout of the album sleeve, which likewise preserves the original context as much as possible. Granted, even with these measures it's impossible to hear the album as it was originally intended or received, so we have only hindsight with which to judge the music.</p><p>
    
    On <em>Animalism</em>, amid near-complete turnover of the original lineup, the Animals play up their r&amp;b; chops on blues and soul covers, and Burdon continues to try to match his heroes by pushing his performance over the top. His voice is undeniably strong-- and this type of approach certainly had a particular appeal 40 years ago-- but his soulman affectations sound practiced, imitative rather than instinctual. Burdon oversells these songs, especially on Sam Cooke's ""Shake"" and the slow, simmering version of ""Hit the Road, Jack"", and his vocals on ""Rock Me Baby"" make the song's innuendo all too obvious. Strangely, on ""The Other Side of Life"" he takes a slightly different tack, aiming for a sound between Elvis and Jim Morrison, but he winds up sounding smaller than the former and smarter than the latter. It should be no surprise that his best performances-- also his most restrained-- are on the originals ""Outcast"" and ""Louisiana Blues"". Burdon's vocals sound more spontaneous and individual, perhaps because he doesn't have an example to mimic on these songs-- or maybe because modern listeners have no other examples against which to measure his performance.</p><p>
    
    Balancing out Burdon's vocals, the Animals prove a powerful band, despite the fact that nearly half of them were new replacements. They're rock solid, but unlike their singer, they rarely showboat. Together they put the real soul in these songs. Hilton Valentine lays down some bluesy riffs on ""Smoke Stack Lightning"", but he's best when trading off with organist Dave Rowberry on ""Rock Me Baby"" and ""All Night Long"", forming a rowdy call and response. It's the rhythm section, however, that shapes the songs and allows the band to move so agilely around Burdon. Bassist Chas Chandler and drummer Barry Jenkins (a sturdy replacement for original member John Steel) put the shake in ""Shake"", pushing a swampy beat to its breaking point, and Jenkins' high hat and snare drive the up-and-down stomp on ""Lucille"". This type of playing doesn't go out of style, even if other aspects of <em>Animalism</em> don't have as much to tell us today.</p></div>"|500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/500-animalism/|7.5|Stephen M.

Forget the ever-shrinking 
    number of venues in which to ply your craft and low sales figures-- the worst thing about it must be constantly hearing about how your art form is dying, dead, or long dead. Jazz may no longer hold the hallowed place in the American consciousness it once did, but it's far from dead, and Vandermark 5 are one of the groups doing their share to keep it alive. Their music is primarily descended from two of jazz's most radical strains, hard bop and free jazz, and on their eighth album, the quintet is in sharp form over two sprawling discs.</p><p>
    
    Ken Vandermark's compositions here reflect two distinct areas of 
    his headspace-- four of them lean hard on wild improvisation, abrasive texture, 
    and intensity, and the other four offer a more lyrical, traditional 
    perspective on the group's interplay. Personally, I'm fonder of the latter, and the difference is pronounced enough that separating the two camps 
    on the two discs might actually have made sense. With upright bass, drums, 
    two saxes/clarinets, and trombone, the band has a unique texture, and the 
    harmonic structure of the songs is sometimes very ambiguous.</p><p>
    
    ""That Was Now (for the Volcano Suns)"" is a challenging opener, with bassist 
    Kent Kessler and drummer Tim Daisy laying down a free bop rhythmic 
    foundation for the horns to fight over. The rhythm section drops out 
    completely for a few passages of unaccompanied horn madness, the kind of 
    flights that invented the word ""skronk."" ""Burn Nostalgia (for Art Pepper)"" 
    operates in a similar vein, but ""Camera (for Edward Weston)"" takes the 
    group's out tendencies in another direction, opening with a long, eerie 
    build on which Vandermark, Jeb Bishop, and Dave Rempis play drawn out chords 
    that sound out of time. When the 
    rhythms do kick in, Kessler plays a bizarre line, laying on long pedal tones 
    and slowly descending over Daisy's ride cymbal frenzy. ""Road Work (for Merce 
    Cunningham)"" is primarily a wide-ranging conversation between Kessler and 
    Vandermark's soprano that's as much duel as duet, though Bishop gets in some 
    frightening blats on his trombone.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the record swings, slowing for the meditative 
    Bishop-led ballad ""Chance (for Nina Rota)"" and latching onto a sweet noir 
    swagger on ""Suitcase (for Ray Charles, Elvin Jones and Steve Lacy)"", which 
    features a great walking line from Kessler. ""Pieces of the Past (for Joseph 
    H. Lewis)"" twists on a dime from driving swing to a spacy beat that the 
    solos can really fly over. But my favorite track is ""Vehicle (for Magnus 
    Broo)"", which features spirited, 
    melodic playing over a breakneck groove.</p><p>
    
    There are places where the band loses me a little, where some fiery playing 
    wanders a little too far from a focused idea or the simultaneous soloing 
    gets a bit too chattery, but this isn't much of a strike against the record. 
    This brand of jazz is about exploration and the thrill of following it, and 
    not every path can lead to a pot of gold. That said, <em>The Color of Memory</em> 
    keeps Vandermark 5 at the forefront of contemporary jazz and should mightily 
    please anyone who's enjoyed their past work.</p></div>"|8399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8399-the-color-of-memory/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    but they've covered a lot of ground. Staffed with strong and versatile
    musicians, all of whom, one presumes, have large record collections,
    they're able to move in whatever direction their improv-craving
    hearts desire. If it's true such outfits are sometimes
    easier to admire as a ""project"" than an actual musical experience,
    there's always an appealing moment of anticipation when a new record
    comes on the market: What's this one going to sound like?</p><p>
    Though there is no crowd noise and the recording quality is excellent,
    <i>Unfortunately is a live album, capturing the band at a Montreal arts
    festival in May 2005. Across nine tracks they dabble in virtually every style
    they've shown, foregoing only extended drones and side-long psych jams.
    The opening ""Out of the Closet"" is a slowly burning ember of
    creepiness á la Nurse With Wound, with creaking noises of
    indeterminate origin mixed with wounded, moaning vocals. How this amalgamation of electronics played
    out onstage I can only guess, but the band switches gears immediately
    on ""Pai Nai"", fusing Middle Eastern scales to a grubby
    mod guitar instrumental. ""Early Reptilian Memories"" is a rumbling percussive
    throwdown, with two or three sets of hands working over kits beneath
    more impenetrable vocalizing, and it bleeds into a sound collage of
    Arabic voices and the noise rock of ""Monobrow"". This is followed
    into the delicate acoustic plucking of ""Half Life"", backed by
    subtle samples and effects, and then into ""Beluga"", which sounds like a twisted version of a High Llamas track. At that point, the jet
    lag starts to set in.</i></p><p>
    The genre-hopping works because Shalabi Effect
    seem comfortable in different settings, but at the same time, none of
    these tracks stand out among the best of their kind. When the band
    flips the fakebook to droning raga-rock on ""Harpie"" its true
    strength is revealed. There's time to breath as Sam Shalabi's
    patiently explores of a single chord; oud, guitar and tabla wind
    themselves around each other in a serpentine dance that may as well go
    on forever. <em>Unfortunately</em> is an effective and honest Shalabi Effect
    sampler, but a half-dozen albums worth of ideas fly by without really
    sticking. More than anything it points up that these guys thrive on
    limitation.</p></div>"|7092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7092-unfortunately/|6.6|Mark Richardson

Those of you who are already familiar with Mylo-- dance-music enthusiasts, British people-- are probably over it already: The singles from this LP have been commercial staples since their original vinyl releases, absolute sure shots for making people happy. Plenty of folks have already completed the process of loving them, getting tired of hearing them all the time, and then filing them away as classics. Lucky for those of you who haven't had that experience yet, there are reasons for the rush: This music packs the same exuberant gut-level joy as Daft Punk's ""One More Time"", Basement Jaxx's ""Romeo"", and Outkast's ""Hey Ya"". Only, well, even easier than that. Mylo is like a dance-music Ramones: What he does isn't very complicated. Technically, he's not even very good at it. But that's all just part of the treat.</p><p>
    The title's misleading: Nothing gets destroyed here, and there's hardly a rough noise across this hour of music. <i>Destroy Rock and Roll</i> is electronic dance music, pure and simple. Mylo's tracks read a bit like a cross section of the genre's history. All the happiest tricks of each era-- disco groove, synth-pop melodies, house rush, downtempo foot-tapping, French filter sweeps, cut-rate Daft Punk, choppy edits-- sharing space. And yet this is anything but one of those big, bursting pastiche albums, packed with ideas and flailing everywhere at once. No, these tracks go in straight, simple lines, and they rarely take their eyes off whichever hooks grab you fastest. Don't count on the dance cognoscenti to approve of them: If anything, this is house music as Saturday-morning cartoon-- all bold lines inked in bright, primary colors.</p><p>
    That simplicity-- Dance Music for Dummies-- is a big part of what lets this collection feel so solid. From ""Muscle Cars"" to its terrific vocal reprise, tracks 3 through 11, just about every song is straight-ahead for-your-pleasure, clocking in under four minutes and hitting like a single straight through. The biggest, simplest treat is ""Drop the Pressure"", a bouncy cartoon-funk bassline paired with a thrilling vocoder freakout. The former's just Daft Punk circa <i>Homework</i>, and the latter's just Daft Punk circa <i>Discovery</i>, but you still can't help smiling when the vocal hook-- ""Motherfucker's gonna drop the pressure""-- starts skipping up octaves and breaking down the vulgar bit. The other tracks pick specific dance vibes and play them up in the most charmingly obvious ways. ""In My Arms"" is slinky 80s pop emotion, complete with ""Bette Davis Eyes"" sample. ""Guilty of Love"" is synthpop too naïve and cheery for 90% of dancefloors on Earth, which Mylo seems too happy to care about. ""Paris Four Hundred"" does the obligatory neon-lit Autobahn-cruising stuff; ""Rikki"" tries stuttering house cut-up like Akufen (or Todd Edwards).</p><p>
    And as much as every one of these things comes across like a coloring book next to an oil painting, that's exactly what gives this record its dreamy charm-- even during its tamer lead-ups, which run Röyksopp, trip-hop, and Air through similar homemade Platonic-essence filters. And questions about how effective this kind of simplification can <i>really</i> be get answered by a one-two punch: ""Otto's Journey"", bouncing like nuts around wet, flickering synths, and the vocal cut of ""Muscle Cars"", which is as sleek, sexy, and quaintly unhip as its namesake. There isn't much in here that could be considered hip, or that shows technical skill. But there's a total gut-level joy, as if these were tracks made by an ecstatic, well-meaning kid who hadn't yet encountered the complicated concerns of the places people might actually dance to them. This is to dance what Art Brut is to rock: cheeky, charming, too straightforward to worry about style, ramming through the fundamentals as if pure enthusiasm is the most important part of making music.</p></div>"|5676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5676-destroy-rock-and-roll/|8.4|Nitsuh Abebe

    needs to have more than just good artists; you also
    need bad or mediocre ones to provide
    contrast. In the still embryonic field of indie rock-dance, we've been blessed with an early run of quality bands, like Love Is All, The Go! Team, and United State of Electronica. Taking inspiration from primary dance sources like
    Daft Punk and the Avalanches rather than the already
    rock-filtered sound of Gang of Four or Happy
    Mondays, these groups have kept the indie kids from
    regressing to crossed-arms days, opening up new
    avenues of high-energy questionable-fi genre
    scrapbooks along the way.</p><p>
    
    With 2004's ""You Are the Generation Who Bought
    More Shoes and You Get What You Deserve"", British duo
    Johnny Boy made a strong argument for inclusion in
    that upper echelon of call-it-what-you-will. Well
    received by critics-- even the ones that don't get
    paid by the word-- ""Generation"" hit the perfect
    balance between the epic and the homemade: the ""Be My Baby"" drums,
    the TASCAM Wall of Sound, the exuberant yell-along
    climax. No small accomplishment to make one of the
    decade-so-far's best singles on the first try, but the
    qualifying test of whether the band could stretch the
    promise of ""Generation"" across an LP frame still
    loomed large.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, the rest of <em>Johnny Boy</em> never
    matches the brilliance of ""Generation"",
    which bats leadoff and provides the record's immediate peak. 
    Playing the genre mix-and-match angle may seem like an
    easy task, merely requiring a mastery of the
    unexpected juxtaposition, but unless the approach is
    meticulously assembled, like the Polaroid pastiches of
    the Go! Team, it can come out as a malformed mess.</p><p>
    
    Besides a few notable and promising exceptions,
    unfortunate or over-busy chimeras are largely what
    Johnny Boy deals out here, collages that assemble
    their way out of emotional range. ""Bonnie Parker's
    115th Dream"" is the easiest target, a junkyard of ""I
    Want Candy"" drums, sax squeals emulating DJ scratches,
    rapping 101, incongruous sample breaks, noir horns,
    and a happy-chant chorus. Songs slum through
    half-hearted stabs at jazzy noir (""Wall Street"") or
    snotty punk (""Formaldehyde"") seemingly just because
    they can, while breakbeats and horn parts turn up in
    places that don't seem so much carefully chosen as
    opportunities to vacantly ""weird"" up the proceedings.</p><p>
    
    Some of these genre excursions may have been more
    successful were it not for the limited range of
    primary singer Lolly, whose sweet Claudia Gonson-like
    voice fit snugly within the Lo-town of ""Generation"",
    but finds itself overextended trying to Beth Gibbons
    her way through the trip-hoppier parts or keep the
    sugar-pop of ""Livin' in the City"" from becoming too
    shrill. It's not until the album-closing ""Johnny Boy
    Theme"", also previously released, that the
    band regains its footing, intercutting girl-group
    sighs with clattering breaks and sleigh-bell fringe,
    while finally using the good old boy-girl vocal
    interplay between Lolly and partner Davo to full
    effect.</p><p>
    
    Between the goalposts of the two already familiar
    highlights, the missteps of Johnny Boy's debut draw

The impressive baritone from his 1980s Japan and solo albums has matured and strengthened over the years, and it carries the drama in his lyrics with ever more subtlety. For 2003's <em>Blemish</em>-- arguably the strongest, but not the easiest record in his catalog-- Sylvian spent a short six weeks writing and recording material about the dissolution of his marriage, and his voice stands against tense, cold backdrops. The turmoil doesn't shake his performance, which is loud and unyielding, but the hurt comes through in the mix: upfront and naked, he sounds completely alone.</p><p>  
    Against that bombshell, <em>Snow Borne Sorrow</em> is a far easier listen, and yet it explores some common themes, and serves as a companion to that other work. Both albums reflect the state of the war-torn world, and the crisis in his personal life-- discussed explicitly in his latest record's title track-- and on both albums, his voice sounds strong, clear, and emotionally spent. But where <em>Blemish</em> reacts to the moment, <em>Snow Borne Sorrow</em> sounds like a series of morning-after ruminations. The record combines songs that Sylvian wrote up to five years ago with his brother and long-time collaborator, drummer Steve Jansen, with newer material that he developed with electronica artist Burnt Friedman. (Sylvian released this under the band name Nine Horses probably to share the credit, but at the end of the day it's his show.) But in spite of its long history, <em>Snow Borne Sorrow</em> is consistent, cohesive, and polished to a shine.</p><p>
    The trip-hoppy opener ""Wonderful World"", and a new, urgent mix of his and Friedman's enigmatic ""The Librarian"", bookend a record of mid-tempo, contemporary pop songs. Smooth backup singers join Sylvian on several cuts, including the exquisite ""Atom and Cell""; but Stina Nordenstem also makes a striking cameo, creeping into ""Wonderful World"" like a high-pitched ghost and slipping cracks and uncertainty into Sylvian's façade. Ryuichi Sakamoto plays piano with the delicacy of a heavy man walking on ice, and Arve Henriksen, best known as a member of Supersilent, follows Jon Hassell, Kenny Wheeler, and Mark Isham as the latest great trumpeter to work with Sylvian. With a wavering, airy tone that's tastefully exotic in the background, yet precise and determined when he solos, Henriksen fits right in with the ambience and the emotional tenor of the record; you couldn't ask for a better sideman for such a slow, sad album.</p><p> 
    Sylvian's last ""pop"" record, 1999's <em>Dead Bees on a Cake</em>, was happier and more eclectic, but it was also far more disjointed; his next solo album-- already in progress, though who knows when he'll finish it-- will continue in <em>Blemish</em>'s footsteps, stripping away the songforms and other conventions and employing artists like Fennesz and AMM's Keith Rowe. <em>Snow Borne Sorrow</em> would seem to mark a clean end to one phase of his work, while <em>Blemish</em> introduces the next: it'll be more experimental, and maybe more difficult, but if that indomitable voice has made it this far, you know it'll just be back stronger the next time.</p></div>"|5925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5925-snow-borne-sorrow/|7.7|Chris Dahlen

    most powerful metal records of the past 15 years.  
    At once perfecting and defining the ""Gothenburg Sound"", the band has  
    spent the past decade facing the prospect of living up to their own  
    reputation. While many others have built  
    upon In Flames' style, the band has slowly evolved;  
    many fans would argue that they've gone too far in the wrong  
    direction, while others would claim they've spent far too much time  
    spinning their wheels. On their past few albums, attempts at  
    experimentation have often resulted in the opposite-- radio-ready nu-metal.</p><p>
<em>Come Clarity</em> has been hailed as a return to form. Album  
    opener ""Take this Life"" is full of promise, kicking things off with  
    breakneck speed and thick riffing. The verses are full of shredded screaming, while the choruses smooth the vocals out  
    over staccato palm-muted guitars. It's a formula In Flames has worked  
    with for years, and there's obviously no reason to noodle around with  
    it. In fact, all of the songs that stick to this basic combination of  
    death metal speed and vocals, power metal guitar harmonies and  
    melodies, and rapid time changes hark back to the band's earlier  
    work. ""Dead End"" follows suit, but mixes things up with guest vocals  
    from Swedish pop star Lisa Miskovsky. ""Versus Terminus""  
    provides a blueprint for laying complex guitar melodies on top of  
    hyper-speed drumming; the result is one of the band's most aggressive tracks in years.</p><p>
    
    These thrash metal moments hold the album together, and  
    there are also several tracks that connect the band's various  
    previous styles effectively. ""Our Infinite Struggle"" is the  
    strongest of these, with its sickeningly heavy lead riff and agony- 
    filled vocals. The instrumental bridge in the middle of the song is-- dare I say-- pretty, but the overall effect is a perfect blend of  
    melody and aggression. Unfortunately, there are still a handful of  
    slower, more commercial sounding tracks. The title track is  
    problematic at best, layering acoustic guitars with whiny emo-tinged  
    vocals. ""Reflect the Storm"" is generic nu-metal, with the same whiny  
    vocal style and a mid-tempo, muted guitar line that offers little to  
    get excited about. </p><p>
<em>Come Clarity</em> is not a return of the classic In Flames sound,  
    but it reclaims much of their earlier glory. Metal bands  
    have an unfortunate history with altering their sound in an attempt  
    to broaden their audience, only to return to some neutered version of  
    their earlier selves once the crowds dwindle. But where so many have  
    failed, In Flames has succeeded. It's as if the years they've spent  
    evolving were merely the process, and <em>Come Clarity</em> is the  
    melodic, head-banging result. </p></div>"|4167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4167-come-clarity/|7.3|Cory D. Byrom

This
    Hertfordshire trio stands about one million Internet hits away from
    enacting The Arctic Monkeys Rule, shooting straight up the charts
    compliments of the Google guys and Al Gore. Also like the Monkeys, the
    Subways shrewdly shy away from Vines-style megalomania or Chris Martin's
    brand of heavy-handed magnanimity while also remaining as stylistically
    vague as possible, resembling the last 15 years of rock residue rather
    than any one or two particular bands. Together with the Monkeys, these
    guys could start a movement to supersede the UK's Coldplay bloc with a
    legion of post-pubescent bands wielding cool record collections and
    above-average riffs. For now though, they're just another indie tabula
    rasa hoping for fans' nostalgia to fill in the blanks.</p><p>
    The biggest snag in the band's bubbly, youthful overthrow, as well as what
    pales them next to the Monkeys, lies in the album title's unfulfilled
    promise: For a bunch of college-aged rockers, the Subways sounds haggard
    and earnest. Blame it on the band's tame, cutesy nature (frontman Billy
    Lunn and bassist Charlotte Cooper are dating and have a Sonny &amp; Cher
    call-and-response thing going on many tracks) or the soporific hand of the
    Coral and I Am Kloot producer Ian Broudie, but too often the rawk they
    bring feels terribly labored.</p><p>
    Case in point, opener ""I Want to Hear What You Have Got to Say"" follows
    the same soft intro/blaring chorus storyteller formula Franz minted with
    ""Jacqueline"", though the first-person plot/plea doesn't stick. The title
    track really exposes the adrenaline deficit as Lunn rips the riff from
    Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Date With the Night"" for the song's flaccid climax. Of course, the
    album's not necessarily all limp mimicry and bark-over-bite attitude.
    ""Holiday"" takes a commendable stab at sneering, off-the-cuff Beatles hard
    rock á la Nirvana, and closer ""Somewhere"" bends if not breaks the
    Brit-rock stereotype with its chunky prog riffage and unconventional
    structuring.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, there's no messiah to lift up this ho-hum album up by its
    bootstraps. Instead we get the Anti-Christ, single ""Rock N' Roll Queen"",
    an allegedly tongue-in-cheek homage to Alice Cooper that has afforded the band an <em>O.C. Mix spot in the U.S. and the highest chart position of their four Top 30 singles at home.
    Forget hipsters downloading eight different remixes of the track on their
    iPod Nanos, this single aims for high school football warmup mixes and
    keg-stand background music. Not that there's anything wrong with Jock
    Jams, but sheesh, who wants a poor man's Libertines album with one foot
    in the locker room door?</em></p></div>"|7845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7845-young-for-eternity/|6.6|Adam Moerder

Remember the reactions? Those desperate for the band to remain in the golden-throated glory days of <em>The Bends</em> puzzled over the move before ultimately chalking it up to a function of Yorke's inscrutable eccentricity; others cited interviews in which Yorke professed to be sick of his own voice as proof there was a more sympathetic method to his madness. But despite all the peripheral talk about the band's blossoming love of electronic and experimental music, few critics advanced the simplest theory, which was that Radiohead had completely succumbed to its own lust for the textures of dance music. No wonder those vocals had to go.</p><p>
      Vocal-fronted acts in dance and electronic music have tangled for years with how to rectify the textural freshness afforded by synths, samplers, and computers with the relative milque-toastiness of the human voice. The disco/house solution has been to lubricate vocals with a glossy coating of filters and vocoders; electro's has been to marry cold, bristly analogs with deadpan vocal affect; IDM's has been to chop, slice, and dice; and a number of general purpose dance acts have decided that multiplicity (by way of an endless procession of guest vocalists) is the key to staying energized. That said, only a handful of electronic full-lengths have navigated the vocal/textural divide as inventively as and refreshingly as <em>Kid A</em>. The latest is <em>Silent Shout</em>.</p><p>
      The brainchild of Swedish siblings Olof Dreijer and Karin Dreijer Andersson, the Knife have released three records, each an exponential improvement over the last.  Although the last, 2004's <em>Deep Cuts</em>, boasted the shimmering ""Heartbeats""-- a sort of ""99 Luftballons"" for the techno set, since covered by up-and-coming indie darling José Gonzalez-- it was also something of a mess, spitting up steel drum samples, happy hardcore breaks, and innocuous synthpop riffs.  A much tighter, laser-guided record, <em>Silent Shout</em> finds the duo honing in on a specific mood, and at last, perfecting a signature sound.  As evidenced by the Chris Cunningham-esque creature adorning the promotional material and artwork of the album's debut single, the operative adjective here is ""evil.""  Along with recent outings from Mu and Cristian Vogel, <em>Silent Shout</em> achieves a forbidding cold-bloodedness by melding contemporary electronic sounds with a grotesque vocal palette.  Call it ""haunted house.""
    </p><p>
      As menacing as it is hooky, this is some bracing stuff.  It helps that Dreijer's arrangements have become more assured and refined over time-- from the rushing percussion and synth flares of ""Neverland"" to the hall of plexiglass mirrors wonkiness of ""We Share Our Mother's Health"", he frequently finds a striking balance between minimalism and dissonance.  But, as alluded above, Andersson's vocals do the bulk of the work.  With ""Heartbeats""-- not to mention her guest spot on Röyksopp's slept-on ""What Else Is There""-- she proved that her shrill voice (think Björk by way of Ari Up by way of Siouxsie Sioux by way of Mu's Mutsumi Kanamori) was capable of magic in its natural form, but little of <em>Silent Shout</em> grants us that pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
      Here, her vocals are almost always multi-tracked, with at least one of those tracks run through a pitch shifter or octave filter or something similar, usually to genuinely creepy result.  On the record's eponymous horrorshow opener, she sounds like she's duetting with Zuul; ""The Captain"" runs her vocal through an exciter and pitch-shifts it up to mimic the Oriental scale; ""Still Light"" has her singing feebly into a ceiling fan from a hospital bed; and ""One Hit"" is possibly the only song in the world that could be reasonably classed ""goblin glam"" (note: that means it's great).  An early contender for best record of the quarter, here's hoping <em>Silent Shout</em> inspires similar imagination and pushing outwards; after all, no matter how heady and interior electronic music allows itself to become, it could never get as scary as the world outside.

Inquisitive listeners also draw benefits from Fahey's activities as a record collector, music historian, and label operator via the ongoing works of his Revenant imprint and the numerous archival labels it has inspired. Yet oddly, these projects-- coupled with Fahey's truly breathtaking virtuosity as a guitarist-- have often served to obscure his significance as an innovative American composer. It's this curious imbalance that co-producers M. Ward and Stephen Brower clearly intend to address with <em>I Am the Resurrection</em>, a collection that features 13 current indie folk/rock acts paying homage to Fahey and his brilliant, eccentric creations.</p><p>
    As a composer, Fahey's initial source material was the primitive folk and blues culled from his vast collection of vintage 78s. But his distinctive style rapidly expanded to reference Bartok, Indian ragas, Gershwin, <em>musique concréte</em>, and whatever else happened to attract his voracious curiosity. And as with many such 20th century innovators, Fahey's true genius was in making his wild stylistic unions seem not only organic and logical but virtually inevitable. However, his intricate compositions do pose unique challenges for the covering artist, primarily because there are so few guitarists who possess the technical ability to faithfully interpret his work.</p><p>
    Nevertheless, <em>I Am the Resurrection</em> is resolutely a guitar players' album, with 12 of its 13 tracks centered upon Fahey's main instrument. (Only Howe Gelb has the horse sense to transpose the ragtime of ""My Grandfather's Clock"" to an upright piano, noting astutely that Fahey played guitar like a piano player.) In addition, the collection possesses an air of reverent nostalgia that likely would've irritated Fahey to no end. Nearly all of the songs gathered here originate from his classic 60s Takoma albums, ignoring the more dissonant, abstract material of his later years almost entirely.</p><p> 
    Thankfully, the album includes appearances by some of Fahey's most gifted acolytes. Peter Case acquits himself nicely on his solo acoustic version of ""When the Catfish Is in Bloom"", in the set's most fearlessly literal interpretation. Guitarist Jack Rose, playing here with his trio Pelt, contributes a dazzling take on ""Sunflower River Blues"", a piece that also appeared on Rose's 2005 album <em>Kensington Blues</em>. Cul De Sac deliver a reprise as well, offering a 1997 live version of ""The Portland Cement Factory at Monolith, CA"" from their debut album, with Robin Amos adding concussive electronic effects to Jones' immaculate guitar arpeggios. Lovely as these two pieces are, attentive fans might wish that Rose and Jones had instead taken a new crack at alternate works from the Fahey catalog.</p><p> 
    Considerably less successful is Sufjan Stevens, whose typically fussy arrangements prove an ill match for the contours of Fahey's ""Commemorative Transfiguration &amp; Communion at Magruder Park"". In his original version, Fahey incorporated portions of the traditional hymn ""All Creatures of Our God and King"", and here Stevens has reversed the process, ignoring Fahey's song as much as possible to focus on the hymn, torpidly stalling the album's quiet momentum. Likewise, M. Ward's electric rendition of ""Bean Vine Blues No. 2"" here falls completely flat. A slight tune that Ward claims to have selected for its sense of humor, it's a track that in this context appears decidedly frivolous and perfunctory.</p><p> 
    Elsewhere on the album, Calexico do an admirable job on ""Dance of Death"" by adding upright bass and marimba to enhance the melody's simmering core. And Devendra Banhart submits a slow, thoughtful version of the exquisite ""Sligo River Blues"", getting his performance across with fervent passion rather than pristine chops. Though Lee Ranaldo does mutely acknowledge Fahey's late-90s work with the impressionistic ""The Singing Bridge of Memphis, Tennessee (Brooklyn Bridge Version: The Coelcanth)"" one wishes that the compilation's architects had roamed further afield to include more experimental, non-American, or non-idiomatic voices. Such an approach would've been a truer representation of the scope of Fahey's work, and perhaps a better indicator of his actual influence. As it is, the best that can be said of <em>I Am the Resurrection</em> is that it makes one want to go spend some serious hours listening to John Fahey records-- an accomplishment that might be tribute enough in itself.</p></div>"|2948.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2948-i-am-the-resurrection-a-tribute-to-john-fahey/|6.9|Matthew Murphy

    nostalgia, I give you Elefant. On 2003's <em>Sunlight Makes Me
    Paranoid</em>, the New York foursome passably reprised the dreary
    disdain of then newly re-trendy influences like the Cure, the Smiths,
    the Psychedelic Furs, and Joy Division, with faint glances shoeward.
    Since then, they've teamed with Disney
    subsidiary Hollywood, which affords them the considerable services of
    producer Don Gilmore (Dashboard Confessional, Linkin Park, and Duran
    Duran-- on their 2004 reunion flop). <em>Black Magic Show</em> is more
    obvious than its already duh predecessor, but otherwise differs only
    in gorgeous frontman Diego Garcia's apparent discoveries of gothic
    musical theater and Russian expat literature.</p><p>
    
    Elefant's latest is only as deep as its clenched-jaw fake-Brit hooks.
    The catchiest, ""It's a Shame"", turns out to be a jangles-on-ice
    ""Lovesong"" rip, or ri-hi-hip-- Garcia likes to Mozzify. Garcia doesn't exactly earn the showstopper key
    change closing ""The Clown""-- let alone the Harold Faltermeyer guitar
    wank-- repeating couplets that rhyme 'cause they hafta. ""It's just a
    way/ A way that we play,"" he offers, or elsewhere, ""The first time was
    the worst/ Now I thirst."" NYC applause lines jut from ""The Lunatic"",
    which despite the portentous title possesses a boringly post-9/11
    mindset: ""Manhattan are you up or down?/ Manhattan are you still
    around?"" Good thing Mickey Mouse is stingy, 'cause the only thing
    worse than the fake strings on cruise-control love ballad ""Why"" would
    be real strings.</p><p>
    
    Sometimes, as Borges wrote, a show within a show raises the
    possibility that we, too, are fictitious, but here as in most
    post-<em>Sgt. Pepper's</em> pop it signals a band's futile fumbling for
    significance. Introducing this <em>Show</em>, the theatrical title track
    sets a vaguely Eastern European rhythm to non sequiturs about devils
    and kings that almost suggest a storyline. ""The freaks have come out
    tonight,"" Garcia warns more typically, adding,
    ""There's no difference between wrong and right."" A similarly
    predictable melodrama pervades reverso-Louis-XIV groupie lament
    ""Brasil"" and eyes-red, flowers-dead ""My Apology"". Michael Crawford never
    suffered a chorus like this: ""You're killing me with your eyes/ You're
    killing me with your lies.""</p><p>
    
    Then there's first single ""Lolita"", bane of my existence, tepid
    scourge of my tired ears. Lo. Lee. Ta. Yes, it's about <em>that</em>
    Dolores Haze, the cynical nymphet so well-loved and ill-used by one
    Humbert Humbert. But even kids who don't know Nabokov like this
    detective guitar jigsaw better on ""Hash Pipe"" or, shudder, ""Juicebox"".
    They, too, will grimace at the song's empty-headed apex: ""I shout out
    loud, Lolita/ You are my heart and soul!"" Garcia should've
    just plagiarized-- assuming he read the book.</p></div>"|2891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2891-black-magic-show/|3.6|Marc Hogan

For one, Little Sparta-- who craft a quaint rustic-yet-dark feel from acoustic guitar, violin, harmonium, drums, and enough minor-key preciousness to soundtrack a stop-motion Tim Burton feature-- would have no trouble carrying a record by themselves.  In some instances here they hint at what a Little Sparta record would sound like: Mitchell's muttered, cryptic rhymes and can barely be heard above the opener ""Scalpel Slice"", and he's not present on two instrumentals, ""Ruins"" or ""I See Life"", where the band digs deepest into its capabilities for melody and atmosphere.</p><p>
    But yes, this can't be called speak-singing, just talk-talking; Mitchell is reciting full-blown poetry over Little Sparta's instrumentals. It would make for an odd reading unaccompanied, though. Listen to ""Mocking Mirror"", where his genial, welcoming voice turns into a convulsion as he barely spits out the words the word ""moon,"" then starts over from the beginning, like a fireside chat from an infirmed uncle or a beguiling old stranger in a hostel or a café. It's a strange touch that would only work on an album, creating the feeling of narration without any real narrative, just a few repeated lines in a thick Scottish accent and thicker tones of regret.</p><p> 
    Things start to shift with ""Skyscraper Housebound"". The band plays more repetitive figures, and Mitchell's placement of the words becomes conscious of the music, waiting his turn for the harmonium to finish its brief interjection before chiming in. It feels like an informal gathering of quick learners, trading off one another and slowly giving each other the proper space. On ""Carefully Constructed Ruin"", the band steps back into almost total ambience, a terse, wheezing drone behind Mitchell's most emotional moment on the record.</p><p> 
    The track with the greatest symbiosis is also the strangest. ""Even the Saints"" has Mitchell shouting just one syllable with every slow, staccato downbeat: he shouts, Eve!...En!...The!...Saints!...Don't!...Like!...It!... Here...!"" (you get the idea) until, finally, he ends the track by restating, in the flattest tone possible, ""No, really; It seems to be seems broken, or at least all fucked up, and I'm embarrassed by my efforts to survive here."" That last line may deflate the track's tension, but it also underlines the bittersweet and unpretentious territory they explore. </p><p>
    Even if they're only truly together on the final track, these collaborators feed off of each other in strange ways, with an edge that keeps this from just poetry set to music.

Ostensibly the songs weren't good enough for proper albums, so consistency and cohesion of theme or sound are usually sacrificed in favor of a catchall organization and stunt covers. This type of release is widely regarded as a means to keep fans interested for another year or two (""stopgap"" is a common descriptor), maybe to make a few bucks off recordings that are just collecting dust anyway, and at the very least to give some insight into the artists' creative process and live show. But sometimes the cliché rings perfectly true, as in the case of Hem's new odds-and-sods collection, enticingly titled <em>No Word From Tom</em>. Featuring demos, live cuts, covers, alternate takes, and non-album tracks, this compilation could be the epitome of this type of release, with all the predictable merits and flaws.</p><p>
    So what, then, does <em>No Word From Tom</em> tell us about Hem? Well, for starters, that they're more adventurous than their polite sound usually suggests, and that their songs are never really finished, but just packets of future possibilities, easily rearranged and retooled. Several songs here are alternate versions of album tracks, with new instrumentation or arrangements revised for live settings. This version of the instrumental ""Eveningland"", from the 2004 album of the same name, sprawls out to showcase soundtrack-ready orchestration and atmosphere, and Hem add two sets of lyrics to that same album's ""Cincinnati Traveler""-- one with impressionistic imagery about the Civil War, the other with lyrics ""misheard"" from the previous version. The best tracks on <em>No Word From Tom</em> are the outtakes from those album sessions-- most notably ""The Present"" and ""Oh No""-- which sound like finished products.</p><p>
    The live tracks, on the other hand, are hit or miss. ""Betting on Trains"" possesses a languid directness that makes Sally Ellyson's vocals on the chorus all the more startling, and ""Sailor"" nicely translates the <em>Rabbit Songs</em> original's orchestral arrangements to a stage setting without losing any of its balanced fullness. But where ""Idle"" should be a show-closing powerhouse, instead it falls short: Despite Dan Messé's descending piano trills, the song feels a little stunted in this new arrangement, implying the potential for folksy drama without actually achieving it. The applause feels only polite.</p><p>
    Perhaps the biggest draw for <em>No Word From Tom</em> will be the covers. Generally, the older the original, the better it sounds in Hemland. Tony Joe White's ""Rainy Night in Georgia"" is just as its title suggests: a patiently paced country ballad about wasting time with a grieving heart, it retains all its drowsy power in this setting. And ""Tennessee Waltz"", a live staple of Hem shows, is a lowly lament, its waltz tempo muted for maximum heartache. But neither Fountains of Wayne nor R.E.M. translates very naturally to the band's unhurried sound: The former's ""Radiation Vibe"" is so slow it lacks any vibe at all, and the latter's ""So. Central Rain"" drains the original of its Southern mystery. So these tracks tell us that Hem aren't always the best judge of cover material, but maybe the adventurous attempt is all that matters-- at least on a release like this.</p></div>"|3995.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3995-no-word-from-tom/|6.2|Stephen M.

Weapons' sophomore LP attempts to be a bridge between the two. The band haven't abandoned the nihilistic front on which they made their name: tinny bounce beats ripe for a Jeezy or Weezy ad-lib still fart away under sewer-rock guitars, although this time around they've added a human drummer for a more credible thump. And Brain McPeck's smarmy vocals are still peppered with aggressively superficial lyrics that seem like tacit rebukes to anyone who's ever felt anything-- the throbbing dirge ""Doghouse"" is an ode to unfounded self-satisfaction; the Suicide-lite creep-out ""Push 'Em Back"" revolves frivolously around that time-honored cheer; the 8-bit pulse of ""Who Rules the Wasteland?"" continues to conflate NY nightlife with a weird Mad Maxian vision of post-apocalyptic turf wars.</p><p> 
    
    The music is better this time around-- the guitars cut harder and deeper, and occasional Rapturous harmonies glam up McPeck's unctuous sneer. But more interesting is how throughout the record, a kinder, gentler (or at least more conflicted about being privileged and shallow) A.R.E. Weapons asserts itself, and despite the hokey context of these glints of humanity, they scan as weirdly sincere. On a serious note, I won't speculate as to whether or not the death of their original guitar player made them take a long, hard look at their essentially cheap take on existence, except to throw it out there as a possibility. On an unserious one, maybe seeing his sister in <em>The Brown Bunny</em> shook something loose in Paul Sevigny's soul, something that rippled out through the band at large. Or maybe it's just another layer of irony, although there are no cues to indicate anything of the sort. I can't call it. Maybe someone just fell in love.</p><p> 
    
    The record opens with ""These Tears"", where, over a nervous plink and crashing guitars, McPeck begins with his usual snottiness: ""All my life you know I've been so cold/ I never shed a tear."" It's surprising when the bluster suddenly turns to insecurity-- ""Dear God what is wrong with me?/ Am I really this dead inside?""-- and even more so when the insecurity turns into bald-faced empathy. McPeck cries for ""the days that [his] heart was black,"" for ""the people [he] threw away,"" for ""the crimes of history,"" for ""people feeling all alone."" Has he actually realized that being poor and disenfranchised isn't very funny? This isn't an isolated incident; time and again the mask of alienation slips to reveal a human being who believes that ""everybody needs somebody"" (on ""F.K.F."") and that ""We fuck up sometimes but in the end we know what to do/ We take each other hand in hand/ Walk off into the night"" (on ""Into the Night""). Just so we're clear, this is still extremely bombastic, ridiculous music, and if you're one of the many people who walked out halfway through Electric 6, you probably don't want to bother checking out Electric 7. But by comparison, A.R.E. Weapons is practically elegant, and if their newfound sensitivity is a put-on, it's at least a convincing one.</p></div>"|283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/283-free-in-the-streets/|6.0|Brian Howe

On albums like 1995's <em>All Balls Don't Bounce</em>, Freestyle Fellowship veteran Aceyalone developed an enormously likable rap style, a big-hearted and joyous lope, jumping in and out of beats and letting loose with gooshy, wide-eyed innocence and an effortless flair. For this album, he's teamed with Rjd2, a producer whose work with rappers usually isn't great but whose instrumental work is perhaps the most gorgeous and expansive in underground hip-hop. These guys have both done beautiful things in the past, so it follows that their collaborative effort should be amazing. Well, um, it isn't.</p><p>
    Instead, <em>Magnificent City</em> is lazy and inept, devoid of force and inspiration and chemistry. Aceyalone sounds as if the decade-plus he's spent kicking around West Coast backpack-rap has stolen the wonderfully warm playfulness that used to just drip off him. He's become broken, almost cynical. More to the point, he's lost his distinctiveness. These days, he sounds almost exactly like his vastly inferior stylistic descendent Murs; a couple of times, I had to check the tracklisting to make sure I wasn't actually hearing a Murs guest appearance. Many of the songs on <em>Magnificent City</em> fit a pre-established connect-the-dots blueprint: the weed song, the I-want-everything song, the birth narrative. Others have lame, one-note concepts, like ""Supahero"", which, duh, is about how he is not a superhero. He doesn't sound excited to be rapping; his vocals are flatter than ever, and his lines are often painful (""Aceyalone, but you can call me Acey/ I'm a real OG like Count Basie/ Hook up the recipe so nice and tasty/ When I'm done, they screaming out, 'Aceyalone, lace me'""). The best I can say about Acey here is that he raps on-beat. Most of the time.</p><p>
    For his part, Rj pulls off a couple of nice tricks, like the strutting horns and chicken-scratch guitars of ""All For U"" and the rolling bass and jingling percussion of ""Caged Bird"". But he's reigned in his tendencies toward big-canvas atmospheric funk, and so his tracks come off sounding pedestrian and unambitious. And when Rj blows it, as with the faux-Timbaland oscillating synth blips of ""Mooore"", Acey isn't exactly there to pick up the slack. We deserve better from these guys.</p></div>"|18.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18-magnificent-city/|3.2|Tom Breihan

So it's fascinating to note how frequently she successfully translates her seemingly individualized style into collaborative formats. In addition to her prolific career as a solo act and as member of the storied psych-folk combo Charalambides, Carter has also paired with Heather Leigh Murray as Scorces, recorded as a duo with Loren Mazzacane Connors, and made numerous guest appearances across a wide array of experimental releases. Her latest active collaboration has been with kindred spirit Andrew MacGregor, aka Gown, a partnership that noisily celebrates its first full harvest with the prolonged, disembodied howl of <em>We've</em>.</p><p>
    
    Recorded live at KDVS radio in California, <em>We've</em> consists of a single 35-minute performance, and likely stands as the spookiest, most unsettling work in Carter's catalog to date. (And I can tell you from experience, it's a particularly discomfiting listen if you've also got one ear cocked towards a baby monitor.) Hailing from the distant isles of British Columbia, MacGregor's hermetic, Jandek-like vocals and guitar strike an especially sympathetic match with Carter's lovely, soaring voice. The resulting union makes a model soundtrack for a haunted evening in the dead of winter, the duo's fervent, overlapping voices calling to one another like wraiths from across the moors.</p><p>
    
    The track opens with an extended stretch of unaccompanied vocals, as Carter and MacGregor almost seem to be measuring what space their freed particles will have available to inhabit. Though the session was reportedly conducted in one of the radio station's hallways, the piece has a profound sense of wide-open distance, with every stray note and shudder fully illuminated against a dark, bottomless expanse. It's unclear if this live recording has been polished or trimmed down from a longer performance, but if there are any edits the seams have been made invisible, and <em>We've</em> seems to unspool naturally in a continuous unbroken thread of inspired dementia. </p><p>
    
    Despite the track's near-constant vocalizing there are no lyrics to speak of, although at points the two seem to be cryptically repeating the ""we've"" of the title. As the piece progresses, MacGregor's guitar becomes increasingly percussive and demanding, a marked contrast to Tom Carter's fluid and more overtly psychedelic gestures in Charalambides. As the song winds down, Gown's vigorous, Derek Bailey-inspired scrabbling impels the music to a conclusion of splintered electricity and primitive, near-rock motion. And though the album's potent allure will likely be most evident to those already familiar with Christina Carter's output, <em>We've</em> proves this promising new duo to be yet another suitable vehicle for her prodigious, surprisingly adaptable talents.</p></div>"|1799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1799-weve/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

    DJs, and producers (some of whom make guest appearances here), that has a graceful way with bass lines and an 
    exacting knack for distorting melody to the point of displeasure. With a personality that lies 
    somewhere between back-of-the-class snark machine and overeducated carnival 
    barker, P.O.S. is the unmitigated star of this crew. He's slick with his verbs and an 
    electric, engaging performer, but he lacks a certain perceptibility.</p><p>
<em>Audition</em> is P.O.S.'s second album and his goals seem dignified: Cull punk's 
    fiery abrasions and mesh it with the continually 
    refined, authentically emotive hip-hop that's been billowing out of 
    Minnesota for some time. This goal is all but impossible. His version of punk's 
    manic, enraged tension-- essentially its spine-- is antithetical to the 
    downy grooves that propelled Slug to pinup status. If recent Rhymesayers 
    history has taught us anything, the more aggressive the Atmosphere song, the 
    more grating. That's clear on the jazzy ""Bush-League Psych-Out Stuff"", which 
    features Slug intoning his quasi-famous ""Gimme a pound or a hug"" mantra in 
    opposition to P.O.S.'s angry young man steez. He's right to mess with guitar 
    fractals and unsteady bass, there's not enough sophisticated intermingling 
    going on in the underground right now. But against a cool, effortless Slug, 
    P.O.S. sounds like a guy tugging on shirt tails.</p><p>
    
    ""Half Cocked Concepts"" opens <em>Audition</em> with the sort of propulsive, 
    shouted chorus and saw-toothed guitars that terrify most 
    dyed-in-the-Air Forces rap fans. It's a trick. Most of the joints after that 
    are more accessible, but his challenge 
    to the audience is obvious: ""Brace your bowels, this won't be easy, I'm not 
    an easy artist and I don't rap about blunts, broads, bitches, bras, 
    menage-a-trois, or sex in expensive cars."" ""Stand Up"" recalls the best, 
    loudest part's of Rjd2's ""The Horror"" and gets closest to his agit-prop 
    propers when he sneers, ""We keep our hands warm with the damn Patriot Act."" 
    Greg Attonito, lead singer of pop-punk progenitors Bouncing Souls, joins 
    P.O.S. for a soaring chorus on the autobiographical ""De La Souls"". The 
    album's most distinctly hip-hop track, it's built on solemn cello and crackling 
    snares, and offers relationship drama (""I can safely say I've never played a 
    woman without Karma catching up"") and family death and metaphorical tangle (""By 
    the time I catch an apple, usually it's rind""). ""Paul Kersey to Jack Kimball"" sees P.O.S. 
    emulating Eminem's gruff, distressed growl, coupled with spare, empty 
    bathroom horror.</p><p>
    
    ""P.O.S. Is Ruining My Life"" is the album's centerpiece but it grossly reverts to 
    Staind-style indulgence, practically demanding raised cell phones and 
    LOVE-HATE tattoos on your fists. And much has been made of Hold Steady lead singer Craig Finn's ""Predator""-dissing 
    appearance on ""Safety in Speed (Heavy Metal)"". The track, downbeat and 
    ethereal, isn't anything special and the political imagery is murky at best. 
    Finn's attempts at adroit observation are courageous but imprecise. Here, like elsewhere, P.O.S. makes reckoning a certainty. Problem is we're just not 
    sure what he'll leave in his wake: canny significance or imprudent 
    blather.</p></div>"|6594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6594-audition/|6.2|Sean Fennessey

One thing metal is typically not, whether black-, death-, doom-, drone-, or otherwise, is ironic; cut-off t-shirts and unwashed longhair on good lookin' Brooklynites qualifies, which is why Nachtmystium vocalist Azentrius was giving it to the good folks at Northsix before SunnO))) took the stage back in December. That said, I saw a reunited Grief play to about 25 people in the Knit basement that same fall, and when Earthride gets back to New York, figure something similar.</p><p> 
    
    Reason being: Earthride have zero charisma, little charm, and almost no non-hessian hooks; this, oddly enough, I think puts them at metal's new (old) non-avant frontier. Earthride certainly have the pedigree for it-- singer Dave Sherman did time in the well-liked Maryland doom outfit Spirit Caravan, and <i>Vampire Circus</i> was mostly recorded by Mike Dean, of the legendary Corrosion of Conformity and Probot. Neither aggressively slow nor aggressively fast, Earthride does a weedburning, mid-tempo cheesy riffs and lyrics thing; actually, what it really is, is rock and roll.</p><p>
    
    ""PURE MARYLAND DOOM FOR THE BROTHERHOOD OF MUSIC,"" as the slogan goes, and you might laugh at the whiskey vocals and 4/4 open snares and bluesed solos. Me though, I still like ""Dirtnap"": ""There's no solace for the ignorance of man/ There's no politicians gonna tell me where I stand/ Fuck no,"" even if I'm pretty sure that ""skin the cat"" also appears as lyric, rhymed, gulp, with ""Dirt. Nap."" That song unfolds loose bar-rock soloed notes after tight repetitive chordings; to this, I play air guitar.</p><p>
    
    Dave Sherman sounds (a lot) like Lemmy; the closer here is called ""Swamp Witch"", which has vocoder FX and organs courtesy of Clutch (gulp) keyboardist Mike Schauer. I'd be ironically laughing (or am, sort of) if I wasn't lifted on ""Vampire Circus""'s lip-pursing doomy forecasts about the ""nature of an endless beast."" The absurdly limited-edition records doomish metal specializes in (free record reviews for that Noothgrush/Sloth split!) suggest that these dudes are not always out for numbers-- even if the contract does say Southern Lord-- and I'll bet Earthride doesn't spend much time envying High on Fire before they pass out on their swagged-up shag carpet. <i>Vampire Circus</i> never stops eying the prize, something you couldn't say about, say, the new Earth, so pick whichever one doesn't bore you.</p></div>"|2936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2936-vampire-circus/|6.0|Zach Baron

After releasing an EP of Morrissey covers last year, Colin Meloy has recorded a six-song covers EP of traditional songs originally arranged and recorded by 1960s folk troubadour Shirley Collins, again to tie in with a solo acoustic tour. Collins lacks the cache of Moz, but Meloy's not playing Devendra to her Vashti. <em>Colin Meloy Sings trad. arr. Shirley Collins is no revival attempt; the purpose of this release appears simply to show Meloy's affection for these songs. As if undaunted by the prospect of reinventing well-known songs like ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"", he lovingly plays them with a little more humor and a lot more care, and as a result, the EP sounds like more of a direct extension of his day job than a mere tour souvenir.</em></p><p>
    
    Collins proves ideal to Meloy's treatment: During the 60s and 70s, she drew on traditional English music as well as contemporary folk to create a revered body of work. These six songs are so suited to Meloy's idiom that they rarely sound like covers. While I'd be remiss if I didn't recommend at least checking out her originals, <em>Sings Shirley Collins</em> doesn't require any knowledge of its source material the way <em>Sings Morrissey</em> did. That was a one-note release: Once the novelty of hearing an indie pin-up boy covering the ultimate indie pin-up boy wore off, that EP was archived on the CD rack, a gem for Morrissey and Decemberist completists alike but a curio for everyone else. But <i>...Sings Shirley Collins has a leg up on its predecessor from the word go: Collins is Meloy's kindred spirit. Her sassy wives, errant wanderers, death-scared sailors, and duplicitous thieves could be the same vengeful mariners and lovelorn barrow boys who inhabit Decemberists songs. </i></p><p>
    
    Meloy fills these tracks out lovingly, eschewing the austere voice-and-guitar setting of <em>Sings Morrissey</em> for an arsenal of bells, banjo, electric guitar, and plucky percussion. The songs remain spare and the mood intimate, but the music feels less imitative and more inhabited. On opener ""Dance to Your Daddy"", bells ding a soft melody to echo Meloy's vocals, reinforcing the song's evocation of parental tenderness-- an obvious choice for the dad-to-be. ""Charlie"" is a little more upbeat, with a banjo bolstering the jaunty chorus. Carson Ellis, Meloy's girlfriend/partner and the artist behind the Decemberists' distinctive album covers and merchandise, makes a brief appearance as a spirited wife-to-be who throws her suitor's expectations right back at him: ""I will marry you but I won't do your washin' or your cookin',"" she sings, proving a perfect foil-- Cher to Meloy's Sonny.</p><p>
    
    Nothing else is quite as upbeat or as charming as ""Charlie"", as the album takes a slightly darker turn with the death song ""Barbara Allen"" (which Meloy, like Collins, pronounces ""Barb'ry Allen""). A metronomic rimshot and a sharp electric guitar stomp out a death march, as if ticking away life's remaining minutes, while Meloy sings of love and mortality, bending up the end of his lines as Collins did nearly 40 years ago. ""Cherry Tree Carol"" continues that funereal pace, dragging a little. It probably doesn't help that Meloy replaces the burbling church organ of Collins's original with an electric guitar that glides around the song's firmament. As if losing energy, the final two songs are the EP's barest: ""Turpin Hero"" is a cautionary tale of thievery and trickery, and ""I Drew My Ship"" is a short a cappella number that might have worked better as the EP's opener, offering a friendly introduction to Meloy's re-creation of Collins' world. In fact, as well chosen as these songs are for Meloy's vocal range and persona, the sequencing does seem slightly off: Listening to these six tracks, I kept thinking I might rearrange them somehow, but of the many possible iterations of the tracklist, none that I devised seemed any better or worse than the official order. It's a quibbling criticism, but this puzzlement prevents the EP from fully realizing the seemingly ideal combination of singer and source. Nevertheless, <em>Sings Shirley Collins is an enticing addition to what could become a very fruitful series.</em></p></div>"|5628.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5628-colin-meloy-sings-trad-arr-shirley-collins/|7.1|Stephen M.

Bleak endings are an obsession for
    this pop consortium's fearful leader and the loose crew's seventh
    full-length isn't just nicknamed <em>The Gun Album</em> because of the
    firearm that graces its cover. Scattered throughout the disc's 13
    rounds, McCaughey goes inside the tortured skulls of cryptic, morally
    challenged characters who contemplate the power of
    bullets, chambers, murder, and suicide. Time and time again, the quick trigger presents a solution to inner struggle while dire consequences lurk
    underneath. It's heady stuff which the songwriter chooses to deflate--
    for better and worse-- with his obsession with all things '60s and
    hummable. Accompanied by Minus 5 regulars including Peter Buck and Wilco
    alongside newbies like Colin Meloy, <em>Gun</em> finds songwriter's
    songwriter McCaughey slightly stuck in his own unique, nuanced niche.</p><p>
    Given the thickening existential angst running through much of
    McCaughey's material, it's hard to believe the former Young Fresh
    Fellow is the same man who wrote ""Amy Grant"" back in '87, irreverently
    musing about the country good-girl (""She just gets rich 'cause she works
    for God"") over funny funk. Well into his third decade writing biting
    witticisms alongside all stripes of guitar pop, the singer provokes
    both heartfelt intrigue and alienating frustration with his current
    style. Further distancing himself from the punk-pop of his early days,
    the frizzy-haired ringmaster serves his slickest 60s-sounding
    recreations yet on <em>Gun</em> with only a few notes bulging out of
    their Beatle-y boxes. Aside from a couple of especially twangy moments,
    the sound is a replica of the replicas McCaughey currently loves to
    churn out, with several songs recalling the Minus 5's 2002 Tweedy-time
    collabo <em>Down With Wilco</em>.</p><p>
    At the center of the songwriter's attack is the
    peppy on the outside/creepy on the inside trick; listen once and hear
    a pleasant burst of Beach Boys harmonies and Byrds-y strumming, listen
    a few times with a lyric sheet and an entirely different, darker beast
    appears. Used well, this songwriting sleight of hand can yield
    surprising results but the dichotomy can also stretch
    songs too far apart as they succumb to toothless, smirking quirk.</p><p>
    The boogie-woogie Brian Wilson bop of ""Out There on the Maroon"" and
    the sunny day bait of ""My Life as a Creep"" can't bridge the gap
    between their shiny exteriors and black-hole cores. Both tell of
    dirtbag loners through convoluted abstracts that are too difficult to
    decipher rewardingly. With little to grab onto lyrically and
    inexcusably blithe cap-gun pop pushing them along, the songs find
    McCaughey pulling out all of his toys at once with lots of commotion
    but no bang.</p><p>
    When indie-lit poster boy Colin Meloy takes over vocal duties on
    ""Cemetery Row W14"", a whimsical pile-on may be expected but, instead,
    the trenchant track is <em>Gun</em>'s surest shot. McCaughey flips his
    approach with the minor piano chords and weeping slide backing Meloy,
    who plays clear-eyed naïf reflecting on death's soft cushion.
    ""Cemetery Row is not such a bad place-- don't you want to go?"" he
    asks, with a sincerity largely absent throughout the rest
    of the record. The subject matter is still mighty grim, but the song's
    idyllic take on the other side offers lively affirmations of
    anticipation: ""Used to be afraid/ Now we love to fade into the
    procession."" McCaughey's cagey talents as a songwriter are
    nearly undeniable. And his erratic aim can still be true when
    he swaps the happytime-mope medleys for a more carefully calibrated
    consistency.</p></div>"|5321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5321-the-minus-5/|6.7|Ryan Dombal

    walls of the Netherlands than an actual musical endeavor. It was the
    punk era, and a complete lack of musical experience didn't seem too great a
    barrier to overcome. The Ex made swift musical progress, though, and by the
    time they made their first recordings in 1980, four songs that comprised the
    self-released 7"" <em>All Corpses Smell the Same</em>, they were a sturdy, rhythmic
    unit with a good sense of dynamics. It was the start of a prolific run
    that's now gone on for 27 years, putting them just behind the Fall for
    extended high achievement by a punk band.</p><p>
    
    Throughout their existence, the Ex have always been steadfastly
    uncommercial, refusing major label deals and remaining
    close to the radical politics that fueled them from the
    beginning. During their first decade, the Ex released a steady stream of albums and peripheral
    tracks, all on vinyl, and while the full-lengths have all found their
    way to CD, the numerous flexi-discs, compilation tracks, splits, and 7-inch
    EPs they put out remain exceedingly rare.</p><p>
<em>Singles. Period.</em> rectifies this situation by compiling all 23 non-album
    tracks the band recorded from 1980-1990, nicely remastered with pulverizing
    low-end and liner notes so thorough they take the disc's full 70-minute
    running time to read. The constants across the disc are Terrie Ex's ablating
    guitar and G.W. Sok's dry, amelodic vocals, taking on overzealous police
    raids, Apartheid, the El Salvadoran Civil War, and nuclear power with
    motor-mouthed rage. Bass players, drummers, and other assorted
    instrumentalists come and go around them, and the band evolves vividly
    across the chronologically-arranged disc, taking the agit-funk of the Gang
    of Four to rougher, nastier extremes and mixing directly with the European
    radical groups whose causes they espoused.</p><p>
    
    In 1981, they and others squatted a house called Villa Zuid in the
    small Dutch town of Wormer to prevent it from being torn down, recording the scathing ""Constitutional State"" for a compilation meant to benefit the
    building, ending with Sok's declamation ""A constitutional state? I guess
    it's too late."" Years later, ""Rara Rap"" became something of a left-field
    Dutch hit for the Ex-- the band wrote the song to protest the Dutch
    government's failure to prevent Dutch businesses from working with South
    Africa's Apartheid government. In between, the Ex raised money for striking British miners and split a 7""
    single with the Kurdish folk band Awara, foreshadowing their collaborations
    with Eritrean and Congolese musicians more than a decade later.</p><p>
    
    As important
    as politics are to the story of the Ex, though, there's an impressive
    musical progression on the disc as well. The early songs are brittle,
    nominally funky punk tunes with the occasional lead guitar phrase and arid
    production. By the time they got to 1983's ""Gonna Rob the Sperm Bank"",
    the Ex had begun to incorporate improvisation and a wider range of timbres
    into the sound. That song's razor-toned guitar onslaught is underpinned by a nasty, industrial bassline and Sok sounds strangely at home lost in the
    maelstrom. ""Lied der Steinklopfer"" features a demonic horn arrangement and
    tape distortion, while Awara's violinist contributes a haunting solo to
    ""Enough Is Enough"", otherwise a frenzied beast of rhythm with what sounds
    like two simultaneous basslines crunching and grinding away at the utterly
    locked-in drums.</p><p>
    
    The hard groove is even more terrifying on ""Long Live the Aged"", and one
    thing that this disc makes abundantly clear is that, even on their early
    releases, the Ex were never slack about their playing or arrangements,
    apparently realizing that if their songs weren't going to be catchy pop
    tunes, they needed something else for listeners to latch onto. The strategy
    worked, and there's not a moment here you could call tepid. Even the bad
    ideas, and there are a few, are executed with intensity and passion and
    usually yield at least a good drum beat. The Ex recorded some great albums
    in the 1980s, <em>Pokkeherrie</em> chief among them, but <em>Singles. Period.</em> is the
    strongest introduction to the band's early work available.</p></div>"|2862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2862-singles-period-the-vinyl-years-1980-1990/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Fine, so they
    never reconfirmed ABBA national stereotypes with more defiantly
    bubblegum brilliance like 1995's <em>Life</em> or 1996's <em>First Band
    from the Moon</em>. They just needed their space. Maybe they got it on
    1998's electronica-tinged <em>Gran Turismo</em>, but they're not the
    ones who didn't call after the dulcet pop-rock slickness of 2004's
    melancholic <em>Long Before Daylight</em>. ""True love is cruel love,""
    formerly blond frontwoman Nina Persson sang on that album's brutal
    ""And Then You Kissed Me"". Turning toward jagged country-rock, sixth
    album <em>Super Extra Gravity</em> strips the bandages from a 10-year
    abusive relationship that hasn't been this poker-hot since the early
    days. It's a reason to keep coming back.</p><p>
    
    Believe it or not, cruelty was always an undercurrent for the Swedish
    quintet, formed in 1992 over a love of heavy metal and a hardcore
    past. Self-destruction is the order on first single ""I Need Some
    Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer"", as a sultry Persson
    describes lovers' quarrels that lead straight to ""a glass or 10."" Yo
    La Tengo guitar squalls intermittently rend smoldering breakup song
    ""Losing a Friend"". A seductive sadomasochism further informs stomping
    ""Drip Drop Teardop"" and dark finale ""And Then You Kissed Me II"", which
    extends its predecessor toward an ironical ""happy end"". On soaring
    country-waltz ""Overload"", with Spector-reverbed honky-tonk pianos, the
    pain gives way to even fierier pleasures: ""I'm hot, baby/ Don't burn your fingers.""</p><p>
    
    Religion soon intrudes on the sex, as is its wont. ""Godspell""
    recalls Emmylou Harris in condemning all manner of crooks who brandish
    the Lord as a crutch, but mostly it seethes with hot-blooded guitar and
    gently accusatory piano. Its
    whistling mid-song march is just one of
    many surprises in the album's carefully constructed compositions-- see
    also the new-wave synth following the straight-ahead ""Dreams""-era
    Fleetwood Mac verses of ""In the Round"". Steeped in organs, ""Holy Love""
    lifts toward an angelic bridge on the strength of bursting bass and
    what sounds like harpsichord, but ultimately finds love as
    conflict-filled as ever. ""I can even be nothing if you ask/ I'll turn
    invisible for you,"" Persson pleads huskily. Despite some gratingly
    obvious rhymes, ""Good Morning Joan"" is a catchy, faster number even as
    it rejects any semblance of salvation.</p><p>
<em>Super Extra Gravity</em> is too deft to be too dark, though--
    there's joy in its catharsis. ""Sit...good dog!"" begins ""Fine Wine"",
    as guitar, bass and drums bark in conversation. ""Little Black Cloud""
    just wants to dance, and second single ""Don't Blame Your Daughter
    (Diamonds)"" is a ballad as VH1-ready as anything on Cat Power's recent
    soccer-mom stab <em>The Greatest</em>, only prettier. These days it
    seems like every new band is Swedish. But my original Scandinavian
    love, armed with a newly raw aesthetic, has finally approached the
    beauty of that long-ago MTV first sight. Hit me baby, one more time.</p></div>"|1306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1306-super-extra-gravity/|7.5|Marc Hogan

When bands emulate everything they consume, success becomes a matter of taste; all derivatives are not created equal, but some are born of nobler blood. Songs become vibes and everything gets somethingified. The albums that crib most fully and unabashedly testify not as suspects but as witnesses. Sometimes we get School of Rock grads, sometimes card-carrying exoticists. Sublime drank Corona with the dullest deities in both camps, but at least they were candid. The jury appreciated that.</p><p>
    Worse than a poor choice of acquaintances is the extrovert's inability-- or unwillingness-- to discern at all. Surveying the 00s British house, garage, and pop schema, Audio Bullys find a lot they like. Too much, in fact. ""You just can't control it,"" claims the title track, apparently referring to Audio Bullys eclecticist impulse. <em>Generation</em> would sit much better if the group focused on something in particular, whether it be ""EQ'ing""'s cartoonish big-beat bash, ""Shot You Down""'s pivotal Nancy Sinatra vocals, or any of the other ideas scattered throughout. Imagine a <em>Since I Left You</em> sans principle and precision. It's okay to artfully muss hair, less so one's vinyl collection.</p><p>
    A recent iPod double-bill backing <i>Generation with Ricardo Villalobos's <em>Ascho</em> did not do the Bullys any favors; Villalobos made brothers-in-scratch Tom Dinsdale and Simon Franks look about as subtle as the Bloodhound Gang. But Audio Bullys don't request attention, they irrupt into your headphones like a drunk at a curry house, usually bullhorning pep rally piffle like, ""You are now entering the mode of the Audio Bullys."" Morally palatable as it is to hear a house record not dredged in fairy dust, <em>Generation</em> makes you appreciate ketamine's bottomless suction or space disco's eternal ascent. But Audio Bullys chase Bombay Sapphire, not white rabbits, tracing a pedestrian trajectory: It's all good 'till you puke or someone gets his nose hairs burnt.</i></p><p>
<em>Generation</em> is a sonic mess, all weightless synth swish, dull beats, and maybe-ironic midi horns. Sample encyclopedias would be able to tag the ubiquitous chordal upbeats ""Bring Light"" hawks for a hook, but the watered-down post-Bangalter vibe comes across regardless. Then there's the rapping, so reliant on DJ phraseology, so devoid of the Skinner-trifles that can endear those clichés, or at least make them sufferable. After Audio Bullys drop lyrical bombs, they light a match. Here's the wanly pneumatic ""Take You There"" to aerosol ""This Road""'s odorous droppings. There's the chummy trumpet call ""Get Myself on Track"", followed by a handful of fail-proof yet tacky love songs. ""Generation"", meanwhile, with its globby lava lamp bassline and chintzy Reason drums, may need a longer soak. Here's an idea: Wait, there it went.</p></div>"|355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/355-generation/|2.7|Sam Ubl

Even tributes to the sturdiest music often winds up negligible at best, hamstrung by a combination of unfathomable artist selection criteria, poorly chosen artist-to-song pairings, and tossed-off, demo-ish production work.  And that's a shame, because tribute albums have the potential to stimulate that world-colliding excitement some of us recall from the comic book crossovers of our youth, one of the key rules of which is that you don't pair stars with nobodies.  When tribute albums fall flat, it's often because they violate this rule.  D.C.'s Batman versus Image's Spawn is a surefire box office smash, but can you imagine Batman taking on, say, Marvel's Power Pack?</p><p>
    
    So if it's remarkable that <em>To: Elliott / From: Portland</em> doesn't suck, it's even more remarkable that it doesn't suck while violating this rule.  Since all the contributing artists are from the deceased singer's Portland home, the tracklist is rounded out by more than a few-- sorry, guys-- nobodies.  Naturally, much of the credit for the tribute's overall success goes to the bands, which, for the most part, have turned in some very considered, fleshed-out renditions of Smith's songs.  But a lot also has to go to Smith himself: Whatever qualms some may have with his aesthetic, he was a very fine songwriter, and on the strength of his source material, even the unknown acts come off surprisingly well.  I'd have bought a Power Pack comic if Wolverine was in it, you know?</p><p>
    
    The tribute kicks off with its big-name draw, a Decemberists cover of ""Clementine"".  With its opening rustle of sheet music, languid count-off, and muzzy harmonicas, it evinces exactly the sense of intimacy that attracted fans to Smith's music in the first place, and Colin Meloy does a good job of imposing his brassy twang without decimating the delicacy of the melody. The Helio Sequence drenches ""Satellite"" in weepy synths, otherwise playing it close to the hip. Swords handles ""I Didn't Understand"" in their usual ""we're not quite Death Cab, but close"" style. Even Eric Matthews holds his own, recasting ""Needle in the Hay"" as a great, fuzzed-out rock creeper. </p><p>
    
    One has to assume that the target demo for an Elliott Smith tribute is Elliott Smith's fanbase, which contains a significant contingent aligned around the belief that any attempt to cover the perfection of an Elliott Smith song is to utterly ruin it.  When Stereogum posted Crosstide's cover of ""Angeles"" (which is pretty good-- synths quiver and swell behind the subdued vocal delivery, pushed along by a drum machine that seems like a deliberate slap in the face to indie folk diehards), the initial run of comments read like a more damning parody of the Smith purist than anything I could devise. ""The synth takes away all of the subtle resolve of the original,"" one poster complained. ""I thought most of the song's integrity were <em>[sic]</em> destroyed,"" opined another. This one, fuming: ""It could easily make the lameness that is the O.C. Yuck, how awful."" And my favorite, ""ugh as Elliott's biggest fan, it's really hard to listen to this, mostly cause it's crappy and the electro shit in the background is so cheesy and makes the song way lame. Sorry Elliott.""</p><p>
    
    The value system that emerges is crushingly predictable-- crappy recordings of acoustic instrumentation, good; anything digital, bad; palpable emotion more important than craft. But if to play an Elliott Smith song with even a hint of deviation from its original form is sacrilege, then these Smithies must be approaching the album fully prepared to be appalled, maybe even relishing the opportunity. To their credit, there are a couple of truly galling moments.  We Are Telephones bludgeons ""Division Day"" into an overbearing, MOR sledgehammer, and in a move that seems deviously engineered to enrage purists, Lifesavas turns in a rap cover of ""Happiness"" that's less terrible than it has any right to be-- but this is only in relation to its being a rap cover of Elliott Smith; it's still a tad painful. Sometimes, two great tastes do not, in fact, taste great together. But for most of this tribute, they do, and casual listeners who haven't invested Smith with such heavy personal resonance will find plenty to enjoy, even if a lot of his core audience balks.  Sorry, Elliott.</p></div>"|11831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11831-to-elliottfrom-portland/|7.2|Brian Howe

I'm prone to the same critical shortcircuiting; if you make a record with that sound, I will probably like it; if you do it well, I will abuse it.</p><p>
    Recorded in pre-ravaged New Orleans, this processed guitar noise record might get tagged ""<i>Disintegration Loops</i> for Hurricane Katrina.""  But the album is much more nuanced emotionally, less conceptual, better edited, and songy in the way Black Dice or Isolée can be songy.  Some tracks, like ""Remove the Inside"", sound like Belong may have written them out on staff: simple melodies stretched out so we feel the jumps in tone from note to note, and hear the color changes as those perfect pitch adverts tell us.</p><p>
    Glee Club kids, there's a song here called ""Who Told You This Room Exists"" that sounds like Josquin's ""Tu solus"" slowed down, burnt vinyl caught on the lock track, the guitars swelling like bass men right before the progression resolves and breathes in again.  The nylon is more audible on ""I'm Too Sleepy...Shall We Swim"", guitar strums blowing over crackly, pitch-black silence like fingers brushing skin-- nerve-wracking, romantic, intense, and hardly there at all.</p><p>
    Of course, the second I mention the title track's slide guitar siren or the breathy static, how it drapes waves of rolling white noise that inch closer and closer until it swallows us loud and whole... I mean if <i>October Language</i> isn't about Katrina, it's at least about hardship, big or small or personal, and music's curious power to help us deal.</p></div>"|1196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1196-october-language/|8.0|Nick Sylvester

In fact, Dilla, if anything, is imposing a meta-rap bent on neo-soul, assaulting the senses in ways unseemly for a guy who used to work with Q-Tip. The drums, though remarkably fluid, are lighter, domineered by dense, abrasive samples that are sequenced with a sense of swing. Percussive end pieces are shorn cheese-grater sharp, then appended to sickly spliced moans. The end result is akin to Norman Smith and DJ Shadow sitting in on a RZA-produced session-- spry, voiceless prog-hop by any other name.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Workinonit"" comes on like a Rubin-produced take on Schoolhouse Rock. Clang-y guitars give way to doubled-up groans and what sounds like a back-masked Zulu chant. The sample, supplied by '60s soulsters Them, is diced with manic precision, and around the 2:00 mark, the melody builds to a climax, fading, with echo-y vocal bits, into bodiless abyss. Equally engaging is ""Anti-American Graffiti"", which combines lighters-up, love-not-war humility with a track both wistful and world-weary: A crazed voice spouts end-of-the-world admonishments like some disenfranchised apparition, colliding with somber guitars.</p><p> 
    
    ""Don't Cry"" finds Dilla taking sprightly, blu-lite soul crooning and flipping it counter-cockeyed: ""If Blue Magic or Whoever could see me now!"" First he plays the original, then throws in the ""Now, you play it and I'll show you how my voice would have made it unbelievable!"" bit, before gently lifting its face off. It's chest thumping, to be sure, like the Copa shot in <em>Goodfellas</em> or <em>Bigger and Deffer. And it's courteous. Similarly cordial is ""Time: The Donut of the Heart"", where he turns the Jackson 5's ""All I Do Is Think of You"" into a lucid dream-- the song's intro is now with the chorus it always coveted. Says ?uestlove: ""[J Dilla] time compresses Michael and Jermaine's ad-libs with the uneasy ease of a tightrope-walker, with oil shoes on, crossing one 90-story building to another, after eight shots of [Patrone]."" I'm sayin'.</em></p><p>
    
    Not that <em>Donuts</em> deals with only obvious sample sources-- ""The Twister (Huh, What)"" is the sound of flu-sick flutes chiming in time to a busted weathervane; ""Waves"", a hiccuping Hare Krishna class. It's Dilla's show-and-tell method, however, that's most effective, because it illustrates how he's, more or less, upgrading soul music-- we get to see how he unpacked its bag, what spots he told it it missed. This approach also allows Dilla to pay homage to the selfsame sounds he's modernized; the drums are light, to reflect the original sound from which he's borrowing. In that sense, <em>Donuts</em> is pure postmodern art-- which was hip-hop's aim in the first place.</p></div>"|4365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4365-donuts/|7.9|Will Dukes

    Roux's <em>Paquet Surprise</em> (""Surprise Package"") is an acrobatic electro-acoustic 
    record teeming with whispered field
    recordings, pretty experimentalism, and sunny pop. From Davis's
    overflowing Jewelled Antler cover collage to the music's constant ebb
    and flow, the collaboration is exceedingly well-composed.</p><p>
    
    Wielding a pair of music degrees, Davis is a Carpark vet and a former Keith Fullerton Whitman collaborator, a computer musician with a
    varied background in classical guitar, jazz, hip-hop, and improv. No slouch himself, Roux works as a programmer at
    IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique Musique) and
    excels at ambiant drone. To the credit of these musical eggheads, the
    collection is a surprisingly loose-limbed, magisterial treat.</p><p>
    
    The first piece, ""Sea Grasses and Blue Sea"", could be the
    faintest field recording ever. Or not. It's hard to say what's
    actually making the sound, but what's dribbling out of my speakers
    feels much like the title suggests-- three minutes of underwater churning. More
    song-based, ""I Am Waiting (For December)"" is a plateau of icy
    glitch pop that quickly sprouts acoustic wings. The entire piece seems to be rocking on a boat; at one
    point, the sound of an aviary swells up and a
    jag of noise mixes with the humid chirps, creating a sort of
    feathery feedback-- enter chimes, a thumb piano, and so forth.</p><p>
    
    A standard trope of the album is tumbling, ruckus-filled transitions.
    Otherwise, it's difficult to pick out tendencies. Ever varied, the
    instrumental arsenal includes a variety of guitar, voice, gong,
    farfisa, kalimba, autoharp, glockenspiel, toy instruments, computer,
    violin, mijwiz (used beautifully by Nick Castro recently), vibraphone, and
    piano. Pieces such as ""Air Castle"" appear to be made
    of invisible bricks and magic beneath those gentle acoustic strums. On
    the other hand, more song-like ""Good Decision"" welcomes a cloud of
    cicadas, a quickly flapping guitar, and Elephant 6 harmonizing.
    Generally, I guess the feel is comparable to Tape.</p><p>
    
    The album's sublime centerpiece is the subtle, swirling ""Tidal Pool"",
    which slowly gathers seaweed and salt over 13 minutes. In some ways it
    recalls the opener, but cycles more like, well, a tide pool with a
    lapping, clipped percussion track-- until it bursts into dainty droning vocal choruses and glisteny sonics. This is followed by ""I Never Met Her"", a vocally muted Sea

    with its shellfish percussion and songing gong.</p><p>

Maybe they could dress as huge cotton swabs, or upright bean bags. Surprisingly sunny and apolitical considering their nostalgia for the man who pounded Stoli in Gorby's shadow, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin are four Missourians who sound like every strummy bunch of white boys from the 1990s who homaged even strummier white boys from the 60s, but damn if their pop chops aren't convincing. The blogger massive has all but boostered them onto the Unsigned Wonder pedestal, and this fuzzily engineered release plays like a loose warm-up, a tribute to their unrusted ""roots"" (er, acts which also happen to be their contemporaries). When SSLYBY deliver a polished product in the future, <em>Broom</em> could be considered ""the Basement mp3s.""</p><p>
    
    Finesse abounds, though. Even the band's egregiousnesses-- the ""bops,"" the ""doots,"" the Elliott Smith graverobberies-- are forgivable due to the ease with which they perform such difficult stunts. On a collection of 10 songs, four heterodes with girls in their titles that flex enough tendon to sidestep tweedom? Check. Dueling vocalists who manage not-entirely-distracting scale-downs of Rivers Cuomo and Conor Oberst? Check, again. Guitarists who pull off coffeehouse restagings of the Shins and Olivia Tremor Control? Tricheckta. Besides, a peak of hypocrisy is accusing someone of stealing music during this gilded age of downloading. (After the coming Cease'N'Desistageddon, we'll chuckle about the days when instant-messengers would query, ""Hey man, is this album worth queuing?"" Because clicking a mouse was such streeenuous laaaabor.)</p><p>
    
    You know what ""I Am Warm and Powerful"" is? Warm and powerful. You know what ""Travel Song"" makes one want to do? Travel. That's the thingamabob about SSLYBY: their story checks out. The dubby opening of ""Anna Lee"" is the only tempo/arrangement surprise, but it quickly reveals itself as acoustic Interpol morphing into acoustic Bloc Party, which ends up sounding like the first Of Montreal CD, and who thought Of Montreal would be around this long? </p><p>
    
    The audience for these tepidly wonderful love songs would be limited only during a bitter and dissonant Prohibition that forced purveyors of bubblegum to use woodland stills. Naysayers unimpressed with crisp choruses and expert bridges might doom <em>Broom</em>'s makers to a subcult-status alongside Western Keys or Home, but something more ambitious is afoot: The songs are fetching ciphers, stowaways on an indie pop mothership, benchwarmers on a charm offense, etc. Their caucasian convenience, their anythingness, expands their range, like how Owen Wilson in <em>Behind Enemy Lines</em> could hide in a mass grave, and then in a crowd, and then in snow. If Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin's local concert hall held a battle-of-the-bands contest with the theme ""Ancestor Worship Done Right"", I wouldn't envy the members of It's a Shame About Vladimir. </p></div>"|7844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7844-broom/|6.9|William Bowers

""I'm your apple-eatin' heathen, any ol' rib-stealin' Eve,"" she sings on the chorus, turning talk of original sin into empowering invective against some unnamed target. It's an odd song with an odd little shuffle to it, and even though it sounds uncannily like Fiona Apple (right down to her rushed cadence at the end of the second verse), the track reminds you how singular Orton seemed on her first two albums and how much she buffed away the rough edges on her third album, <i>Daybreaker, an AOR makeover that aimed for but missed the same listeners who one year later made Norah Jones a sensation.</i></p><p>
    
    So it's nice to have the old Beth Orton back. It's also nice to have Jim O'Rourke at the helm, particularly because he puts some rhythm back into her songs. Orton needs it, too: Her voice hits your ears at an angle, as if refracted prismatically, and O'Rourke's sturdy beats don't reset that angle to perpendicular so much as make sure it hits its target with a little more force. <em>Comfort of Strangers</em> is strongest when O'Rourke and percussionist Tim Barnes translate <em>Trailer Park's spacey effects into earthier rhythms, especially with the oscillating bassline and tight drum beat on ""Conceived"". They let loose on ""Countenance"" and are joined by what sounds like a full band on ""Shopping Trolley"". The intro to the title track sounds like ""Walk on the Wild Side"", but to their credit, Orton and O'Rourke undercut that seedy strut with handclaps, sparkling piano, and perhaps her most straightforward performance.</em></p><p>
    
    Orton's vocals-- so arced and mellifluous-- reign over all other sounds on <em>Comfort of Strangers</em>. On <em>Daybreaker</em>, her voice sounded like an empty vessel, beautiful but conveying very little; here it has a very real personality behind it, one that allows itself to be angry, cynical, hopeful, and snide-- a complex and compelling emotional mess. This attitude fits her songwriting well, giving her words added resonance. On ""Heartland Truckstop"" she sings, ""I wanted to love, but I turned 'round and hated it,"" and her strong, glaring delivery of that second line-- as if she's making eye contact through her voice-- reinforces not just the wordplay, but the cheated disappointment of the sentiment. </p><p>
    
    Death of love is the constant, often oppressive theme of <em>Comfort of Strangers</em>, which gives these songs the feel of dark therapy, often so dour as to be claustrophobic. The sense of a lesson learned, however platitudinous, on the closer ""Pieces of the Sky"" finally tempers Orton's clenched emotions: ""When it's over it's over/ I best get busy living/been a long time gone."" But ""A Place Aside"" and ""Safe in Your Arms"" comprise the album's still-worn heart. In ""A Place Aside"" her concrete imagery (""Pull me close and we lay still/ Wrap my toes around your heel"") risks an intimacy that suggests the heartache that ostensibly inspired the other songs, but ""Safe"" undercuts that sentiment as Orton wonders if the past's good memories are worth the present's bleak pain. Torn between the illusion of security and the reality of heartbreak, these songs remain complex and open-ended, her questions unanswered. That's the key to <em>Comfort of Strangers and the source of its impact. Far from perfect-- at times even dull-- these songs balance their heavy despair with genuine, if hesitant, hope. The contrasts in the music mirror her internal struggle, even if </em><em>Comfort of Strangers</em> is destined always to mean more to its makers than to its listeners.</p></div>"|6050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6050-comfort-of-strangers/|7.2|Stephen M.

After all, guitarist Bryce Dessner pulls 
    double duty with both groups, while Clogs leader Padma Newsome has 
    guested on all three National albums. As if there's not enough 
    cross-pollination happening, Bryce's brother Aaron (also a guitarist for 
    the National) is featured on <em>Lantern</em>, Clogs' fourth album. And if 
    this is your first exposure to Clogs, you've picked a 
    fantastic time to become acquainted.</p><p>
<em>Lantern</em> is the most fully realized version of Clogs' aesthetic, 
    seamlessly mixing their musical reference points-- classical, European folk, post-rock-- into a unique 
    sound. Unlike previous Clogs albums, which primarily featured 
    compositions written either solely by Newsome, or in conjunction with 
    Dressner, <em>Lantern</em> is a collaborative effort. Each 
    original track on this disc is credited to the group as a whole, and 
    this joint effort shows in the performances. This collaborative spirit extends beyond the confines of the group. <em>Lantern</em>'s first track is performed by a guest, Italian Baroque guitarist
    Luca Tarantino, who turns in a fine solo interpretation of a piece by
    17th Century lute player Johann Hieronymus Kapsberger.</p><p>
    
    On most instrumental albums, both the slow, steady ""Canon"" and the 
    more impatient ""5/4""-- the two cuts that earn the group their post-rock 
    merit badges for 2006-- would be the unassailable high points. On this 
    disc, they're vying for space with lots of worthy candidates. Newsome's 
    lyrical violin plays counterpoint to Rachael Elliot's mournful bassoon 
    on ""2:3:5"", giving way to a elliptical swirl of steel drums; on the title track his plaintive voice asks for a light to bring him home.  ""Tides of Washington Bridge"" appears twice on <em>Lantern</em>-- first as a wistful piece centered around ukulele and mandola, 
    punctuated by soft bursts of guitar feedback as it ends, then performed solely on piano, the sad melody circling upon itself.</p><p>
    
    Yes, for the most part, this is a downbeat record, albeit with one 
    notable exception: ""The Song of the Cricket"", which builds to a gentle portentous crescendo. 
    Near the end, however, it deftly switches to a comical jazzy strut that 
    doesn't sound the least bit out of place. A few more moments of levity 
    might be a welcome addition to the group's repertoire, but this is a 
    minor gripe. This album finds an already adventurous group of musicians 
    combining their ambition and skill to create an engaging work.</p></div>"|1788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1788-lantern/|8.2|David Raposa

His records-- 15 years' worth of them-- feel, above all, private. Some of that privacy comes from genre and style: The music can be dreamy and abstracted, qualities that once made His Name Is Alive a natural fit for the arty English label 4AD. More often, though, it's down to Defever's singular approach to recording, always several degrees off from the conventions of normal pop. The drums hide away, like in pre-rock recordings; they add rhythm but rarely drive the whole. The instruments sound neither glossy nor raw, natural nor artificial; mostly they're just quiet, minimized, almost pious. The air around them-- and there can be plenty of it-- seems strangely empty, the same way winter snow can deaden all noise. And then there's the treatment of voices, almost always those of
    women, foregrounded above all else, and treated so that they feel like
    someone is singing softly right in your ear-- in calm, repetitive,
    uncomplicated chants. The effect is such that it's hard to imagine anyone listening to this music when not alone. Couples, maybe. Crowds, parties-- how?</p><p>
    The amazing thing, then, is that Defever's musical world is anything but insular, anything but stuck in that corner. Some of his influences are unsurprising: The slurry, ghostly pop His Name Is Alive made for 4AD has run toward shoegazing and electronics, Beach Boys worship, and dub experiment. Some of the other sources are more remarkable than Defever gets credit for. He grew up in the orbit of Detroit and learned guitar from his grandfather; he has old-time music in him, not as a curiosity but as a presence: folk, country, blues, and gospel, from 1950 backward. The fact that his project is no longer with that arty English label may even have something to do with their last two albums-- on which Defever quietly and unselfconsciously set about making collections of blues and soul music. None of this is pastiche, or dabbling, or borrowing styles-- each of these threads winds its way naturally into that private world. You probably wouldn't hear a His Name Is Alive song and describe it as ""blues""; you'd spend hours with it before realizing how strange it would be to call it anything else.</p><p>
    All of this is truer than ever on <em>Detrola</em>, the group's first full-length in four years, and their first since leaving 4AD. Every one of those sounds runs through here, woven together so naturally that the weaving itself is the furthest thing from the listener's mind: This sounds like absolutely nothing but a His Name Is Alive record, and one too shockingly good to go thinking much about constituent parts.
    </p><p>
    Its bookends are dirges, laments-- a fiddled spiritual on ""Introduction"" (""The darkest night I ever saw was the night I left my love"") and folk blues on ""I'll Send My Face to Your Funeral"" (""I've seen too many things I couldn't stand to see""). In between, the most remarkable things happen. There's the same lulling, hypnotic tone that's always made the band an indie affair-- the same soft-spoken beauty as fellow private types like Red House Painters. But there's plenty more. ""After I Leave U"" makes pop from synthesizers that's anything but synth-pop; too brittle and strange, and too natural, so that the eventual appearance of a vocorder still feels fiercely alien. ""Seven Minutes"" is brittle r&amp;b, shot through with free-jazz saxophone runs, as voiced by Lovetta Pippen, one of three women singing on this record. ""Get Your Curse On"", the record's emotional peak, is also its uplift, a swinging piano-pop bounce that feels like Burt Bacharach and Dionne Warwick in a sexual battle of wills: They defend (""Your ju-ju comes in short supply/ Your curse won't work on me this time"") and they attack (""I could turn you on so fast/ Your heart, your heart, your hands, your hands"").
    </p>
<p>
    It's a short record-- just under 40 minutes-- and better for it; the second half sweeps you effortlessly along to that final dirge. ""C*A*T*S"" is electro-pop hypnosis, shuffling along on two chords, mutating drum breaks, and meowing synths. ""You Need a Heart"" shoots back to the sweet, delicate sonic candy of 1996's <em>Stars on ESP</em>, the peak of Defever's Beach Boys fixation. ""I Thought I Saw"", closer to the start, is doing either Memphis soul or Steely Dan southern-California studio action; it hardly seems to matter which.
    </p>
<p>
    What matters is that Defever is doing exactly what we've always claimed to want from musicians. His world is his own, unique and uniquely stylized, describable less in terms of genre and more in terms of impressions: snow, transistor radios, empty rooms, sepia tones, dreams. More importantly, his world is large: There are wide ranges of the history of American music in here, whether exhibited or just acknowledged. He's cloistered, but he's not a solipsist. On <em>Detrola</em>, the music feels as private as ever; you'll come to this exhibit one at a time, and it's still too particular in its tastes to imagine a large audience for it. But it's fantastic art, full of depth and warmth and creativity. It's probably the best thing Defever's ever done.

    low-key affair all the way around. No one expects these round-ups to
    be barometers of a sub-genre's health, the way the label's <i>Total</i> comps
    can be; no ground is broken in terms of form or technology. The <em>Pop
    Ambient</em>s arrive without much of fanfare and are consistently enjoyable
    if rarely revelatory. The differences from year to year are subtle and
    have more to do with curatorial whim than any overriding trends.</p><p>
<em>Pop Ambient 2006</em> gets its particular flavor from artists that seem
    particularly enamored of the sound of traditional stringed
    instruments. More than half the tracks make prominent use of guitar or
    piano, often untreated, which often has an odd dating effect, drawing
    the mind back to sample-heavy ambient house of the early 90s. At its
    best, as on Uli Teichmann's opening ""Piano Tec"", the electro-acoustic
    blend conjures the gloriously adventurous Cluster in their mid-70s
    heyday. Elsewhere, the choice of sounds seems more formulaic. Markus
    Guentner &amp; La Grande Illusion's static ""Baghira"", built around a simple
    loop of a plucked guitar chord, aims for poignancy and doesn't come
    close.</p><p>
    The best moments come when producers step outside established
    templates. The Orb's ""Edelgrün"", with its guitar strum, piano chord
    loop, and bouncy rhythm, exits the background zone completely and
    serves as relaxed (and quite wonderful) instrumental pop. A stranger twist comes from the inclusion of two cover songs, an idea that would have been unthinkable on the vaporous and abstract <em>Pop
    Ambient 2001</em>. Sebastian Meissner's Klimek confronts one of the giants
    of the genre as he pairs with a harpist to tackle Satie's ""Gymnopedie
    #1"". It's a respectful deconstruction, with only a couple stutters and
    a smidge of digital noise to let us know we're not listening to the
    soundtrack to a credit card commercial; the melody is as detached
    and lovely as ever. Far more compelling is Justus Köhncke &amp; Fred
    Heimermann take on Fleetwood Mac's laidback instrumental ""Albatross"",
    which brilliantly buries the original guitar refrain original under a
    sequence of percussive guitar plucks and a thick layer of frosted
    processing.</p><p>
    Pass Into Silence's ""Iceblink"" and Mikkel Metal's ""Decline"" hearken
    back to <em>Pop Ambient</em>'s original sonic inspiration, the percolating
    organic drone late-period work of Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project, but
    these cottony bliss-outs are few. Instead we get a more tuneful <em>Pop
    Ambient</em> with a slight classicist bent. Tasteful as ever, which cuts
    both ways.</p></div>"|2022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2022-pop-ambient-2006/|7.2|Mark Richardson

Between the two of them, they've produced some of the best dance music, regardless of genre, over the past few years: ""I Feel Space"", ""Goettsching"", ""There's a Drink In My Bedroom and I Need a Hot Lady"", ""Alien In My Pocket"", and remixes for just about anyone who's been given techno props at Pitchfork. Their sound is a mixture of nostalgia and retro-futuristic sheen, mining similar emotional spacefields as Daft Punk, Avalanches, Air, and LCD Soundsystem, even if they don't necessarily cross the same musical borders.</p><p>
<em>Lindstrøm &amp; Prins Thomas</em> is the duo's first full-length album, and rather than stuff it with previous released singles or B-sides, they've opted for mostly new music. And much like with James Murphy's LCDS record from last year, it could have used a few more ringers: While <em>L&amp;PT;</em> gives a serviceable account of what these guys do, most of the songs aren't exactly their best. Tunes like ""Boney M Down"" or ""Claudia"", with almost identical drum patterns and basslines, pass by without much fanfare or reason to listen to them. They're pleasant, and though hardly ""bad,"" are examples of an already smooth record gone completely passive. Conversely, the slow ballad ""Don O Van Budd"" works passivity to its advantage, leaving empty space in between its sluggish beats and building tension in the process-- even if it's the kind of tension you might hear in a Lionel Richie song.</p><p>
    The best stuff on the record seems effortless and breezy by comparison. Opening track ""Foreløpig Bit"" features a masterful arrangement of disco rhythm section (and another variation of what is apparently the pair's favorite bassline), quasi-Arabic synth melody, and one of Lindstrøm's signature chord changes, which transforms the song from good vamp to lovely surprise. The underrated 2005 single ""Turkish Delight"" isn't as extravagant, but features one of many nice guitar leads, and a subtle, Italo-informed synthesizer riff in the background that lends much-needed forward momentum. ""Sykkelsesong"" is heavier, and also features a cool, vaguely Afrobeat guitar riding atop a hard disco pulse, and with a big, pillowy synth cluster punctuating the ends of phrases every now and then. The melody is there, but like many of the pair's best tracks, it's not necessarily as important as the overall effect of perpetual motion and organic performance.</p><p>
    Of course, a mixed bag LP hardly dents Lindstrøm &amp; Thomas' reputation for A-list singles and remixes. As of this writing, Lindstrøm has released two singles since this record came out (""Monsteer"", and ""Mighty Girl"" with Thomas) better than most of what you'll find here. I say keep tracking their progress-- and lobby for a comp.</p></div>"|5000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5000-lindstrm-prins-thomas/|6.8|Dominique Leone

It seems every week someone's crying
    wolf over a new Joy Division-via-Interpol soundalike that's really only a
    half-hatched post-punk band with a stuffy nosed singer. Yet this
    L.A. duo practically copies Interpol's DNA with a genre-warping flair that'd
    crush the Bravery's Skabba the Hutt dude. You see, She Wants Revenge bears
    more resemblance to Soulwax than, say, the Killers. DJs Adam ""Adam 12""
    Bravin and Justin Warfield spawned this indie chameleon after several
    years of dabbling in the West Coast club scene, most notably Warfield's
    promising 1993 Prince Paul-produced rap debut and his sophomore slumpy
    arena rock album released under the moniker The Justin Warfield Supernaut.</p><p>
    Rappers turned indie rockers? Heresy! Well, on a fundamental level,
    probably, but SWR circumvents the genre integrity question with precision
    and time-tested professionalism. While Warfield and Bravin don't deserve
    bonus points for actually being teenagers during the 80s as they suggest,
    they're studio rats who trouble and toil for the exact sounds necessary to
    propel their mediocre songwriting. Also, they're not making any effort to
    hide their influences. Titles like ""I Don't Want To Fall In Love"" and
    ""Tear You Apart"" are lazy permutations of post-punk poetry, and the whole
    psychotic female protagonist shtick spans from ""She's Lost Control"" to
    ""Stella Was a Diver And She Was Always Down"".</p><p>
    Basically SWR songs come in two breeds-- sprawling drone operas á la ""PDA""
    sans catchiness, and clubby goth-stompers that force Madchester scenery on
    unreceptive American audiences. Single ""Sister"" captains the former
    category, dropping an overcast surf riff that crashes at the chorus,
    t-boning an equally menacing synth. Problem is, all the rock tracks
    have the same melody, so if you didn't like the guitar/vocals interplay on
    ""Sister"" you'll really hate it on opener ""Red Flags And Long Nights"", and
    by ""Someone Must Get Hurt"" you'll already have turned your iPod off to
    watch <em>24 Hour Party People</em>.</p><p>
    Like so many mid-level retro bands, SWR feel most
    comfortable playing the dance-rock card, though the strategy creates a
    glass ceiling. Sure, the hooks on ""I Don't Want To Fall In Love"" and
    ""Monologue"" strike the hardest, but at best they're eerily
    predictable. The rhythm section doesn't help either, permanently stuck on
    a default setting somewhere between industrial and Duran Duran. Sadly, the
    brightest spots burn the shortest, such as the two-and-a-half minute fugue
    ""Disconnect"" or <em>Pornography</em> offspring ""Us"". Too ugly and
    inaccessible to suggest some sort of post-punk cash-out, they stick out in

As with airports, its moments can snap from pleasant daydream to unnecessary hassle in the time it takes to put your handgun in someone else's bag.  In an effort to get into the mind of Guillermo Scott Herren, I took this album to a luggage store in Koreatown (not exactly the airport, but similar), where I suggested to the owner that I would only bag-shop to theme music.  He told me to ""go fuck,"" so I went and listened in the alley.</p><p>
    
    First things first: Herren insists that this is not an ""actual"" album. I have no idea what this means, but critical preemptions aside, <i>Security Screenings is a marked improvement over last year's directionless <em>Surrounded by Silence</em></i>, which missed its mark of collaborative opus.  Songs here wander but don't get lost, the subtlety of their direction possibly a result of Herren's humbling tumble from <em>avant garde b-boy to laptop nomad.  The shuffling ephemera of his previous work is again evident, as are the melodies that abstained from the bizarre street anthems of <i>Silence</i></em>.</p><p>
    
    Whether recording under the guise of Prefuse, Savath, Delarosa, or Piano Overlord, Scott Herren is at his most listenable when his influences are tangled, not strewn about. ""Weight Watching"", which begins with a chopped sample of Mobb Deep's Prodigy, unfolds into a kaleidoscope of clanging knives and Herren's signature oil-and-water synth flourishes.  It's the one beat on <em>Security Screenings that could support an MC, but Herren smartly keeps the sampled P on announcer status.  And that's the difference here: Herren is measured.  He may reach at times, but never enough to fall off.</em></p><p>
    
    Striking another sharp contrast to <i>Surrounded by Silence</i>, <i>Security Screenings</i>' two guests actually contribute the album's two finest moments. Four Tet's appearance on ""Creating Cyclical Headaches"" sounds exactly as you might expect, a rambling FT break and bubbling keyboard scathed by Herren's free-noise, fading out to a plucked acoustic. It's possible that I may simply prefer Kieran Hebden's drums to Herren's, but Hebden can often be too prettily pastoral, which is why Herren's industrial grind makes for a welcome pair-up.  TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe, meanwhile, is given credit on ""We Leave You in a Cloud of Thick Smoke and Sleep Outro"", but his voice is sampled and layered until it merely becomes ambient drone. Still, this serves as a reminder that Herren is wholly capable of creating modest soundscapes from opportune moments, and an indication that the criticism of <em>Silence</em>'s stargazing may have had some effect-- although I suppose we'll have to wait for his <em>actual</em> album to find out if anything has changed.</p></div>"|6454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6454-security-screenings/|6.9|Peter Macia

From his days running one of Kingston's      most successful sound systems through the founding of the      Studio One label and studio to his relocation to New York in the      mid-1980s, Dodd was at or near the forefront of Jamaican music, weathering      and helping shape each new trend. Nearly every major name in the island's      music scene recorded for him at least once, and such luminaries as Prince      Buster, Lee Perry, Dennis Brown, and Peter Tosh (Bob Marley came to Dodd with      Tosh &amp; the Wailers after recording just four tracks for Leslie Kong)      began their careers working with or for him.</p>
<p>Dodd was      also one of the original innovators of the signature Jamaican off-beat rhythm.      His production of Theophilus Beckford's instrumental ""Easy Snappin'"" is,      along with early productions by Edward Seaga and Prince Buster, among the      first recordings to hint at the transformation of straight-ahead      Jamaican r&amp;b; into ska. Naturally, over the course of three decades, Dodd      compiled an imposing back catalog, and approaching it as a newcomer to      reggae is daunting, to put it mildly. Given that a collection of ""the best of Studio One""      could easily be a 12-disc box set, it stands to reason that the folks      at Heartbeat didn't have much trouble finding 32 killer tracks to spread      across <i>The Best of Studio One (this release is a remastered and expanded      version of a 1985 compilation with informative, if somewhat partisan, liner      notes) and its companion volume, </i><i>Full Up</i>.</p>
<p>Both volumes are excellent and serve nicely as a starting point to Studio One, but they're also likely to appeal to people who've already done a      little exploring, as each includes a mixture of big and small names.      Bringing together material spanning from rocksteady to the early dancehall years, these discs      aren't exactly focused, but even as styles shifted and the      studio setup expanded, the Studio One sound remained pretty consistent, with simple, in-the-pocket drumming,      phenomenal basslines, great horn arrangements, and plenty of amazing vocal      harmonies.</p>
<p><i>The Best of Studio One</i> features three of Jamaica's greatest soul vocalists,      John Holt, Alton Ellis, and Ken Boothe, each in superb form. Ellis's ""Can      I Change My Mind"" skanks so easy it feels weightless, and Boothe's ""Just      Another Girl"" features some backing harmonies for his supple voice      to play off. A handful of great rocksteady harmony groups present      reggae's sweet side, lead by the Heptones' drifting three-part vocal      arrangement on ""Party Time"". Slim Smith's ""Born to Love"" sound like the      Impressions in Jamaica, while the Lyrics, later to become famous for the      Marcus Garvey tribute ""Black Star Liner"", sound deceptively sugary on the      obliquely topical ""Music Like Dirt"".          Dancehall star Johnny Osborne's honey voice mingles beautifully with roots      harmonies on the transcendent ""Jah Promise"", one of several pointedly      Rastafarian songs. The Rasta angle is taken further by the Abyssinians, who      get overtly political on 1969's ""Declaration of Rights"", singing ""Get up and      fight for your rights, my brothers/ Get up and fight for your rights, my      sisters"" in something of a warm-up for the following year's epochal ""Satta      Massa Gana"", one of reggae's defining militant tracks.</p>
<p><i>Full Up</i> features a similar balance of the sweet and the heavy, opening with      the lilting rocksteady of ""Love Me Forever"", by Carlton &amp; the Shoes and      sprinkling soul tracks like Bob Evans and the Paragons' horn-fueled ""Danger      in Your Eyes"" and the Royals' harmony-soaked ""Pick Up the Pieces"" around      Babylon call-outs from roots icons Burning Spear and Culture. Culture's      ""Behold the Land"" is a particularly stunning affirmation of black pride set      against the history of slavery. Willie Williams tackles modern iniquity on      ""Armagideon Time"", singing ""A lot of people won't get no justice tonight/ So      a lot of people going to have to stand up and fight"" over the Sound      Dimension's classic ""Real Rock"" riddim.</p>
<p>Which brings us to a third Studio One release: <i>Downbeat      the Ruler</i> collects instrumentals from the late 60s and early 70s,      focusing primarily on the rocksteady era, when the Sound Dimension      (originally known as the Soul Vendors) ruled as Studio One's house band.      Featuring ex-Skatalites Tommy McCook and Jackie Mittoo, the Sound Dimension      backed dozens of singers on a slew of hits in the late 60s, but they made      just as great an impact with their instrumentals, most of which have been      versioned and copied many times over.</p>
<p>The Sound Dimension's importance to the sound of Studio One from 1967 onward      is evidenced by the fact that seven of the 18 tracks on the disc are      theirs, with an additional three from the Soul Vendors, and solo tracks from      Tommy McCook and Jackie Mittoo. Mittoo's ""Freak Out"" is a deep groover,      grounded by his subtle Hammond organ and a massive bassline, with a great,      easy-flowing horn arrangement on top. The Sound Dimension's ""Real Rock"" is a      defining track for its stabbing organ hook, immense groove, and drawn-out      trombone melody. Dub Specialist's ""Banana Walk"" and the Soul Vendors'      10-minute ""Death in the Arena"" showcase Studio One's early embrace of dub,      though Dodd's dub output was always overshadowed by that of Lee Perry,      Augustus Pablo, and King Tubby.</p>
<p>These three discs offer a look at just a tiny slice of the incredible body      of work Dodd oversaw during his lifetime, but it's a good slice, below the      radar for most Americans but not so obscure or arcane that newcomers will      have trouble getting behind the offbeat. I'd recommend <i>The Best of Studio      One</i> and <i>Full Up</i>-- solid introductions to Dodd's inestimable legend-- to just about anybody, while <i>Downbeat the Ruler</i> is a      better bet for those already committed to exploring Jamaican music in its      various guises.</p></div>"|11715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11715-the-best-of-studio-one-full-up-more-hits-from-studio-one-downbeat-the-ruler-killer-instrumentals-from-studio-one/|8.9|Joe Tangari

One day you will become a painter...We will guide your hand."" So Lesage obediently began to spend his free time painting, believing his work to be fully dictated and channeled through him by unseen forces. And on <em>Bells For Augustin Lesage, the latest recording from Alex Neilson's solo/group project Directing Hand, it appears that the musicians have taken to heart Lesage's creative principles, particularly his overriding doctrine: ""Do not try to understand what you are doing."" </em></p><p>
    Following a couple of limited edition CD-Rs, <em>Bells For Augustin Lesage essentially stands as Directing Hand's debut album, and as such offers the best vantage yet of Neilson's unique talents. A prolific Scottish free percussionist, Neilson has played alongside Will Oldham, Richard Youngs, and Alasdair Roberts-- and his underground credentials are such that in 2004 he was enlisted to play drums for Jandek's first live performance. Although Directing Hand is billed as a solo vehicle, Neilson here receives help from such like-minded compatriots as Christina Carter, Isobel Campbell, and Scatter's Chris Hladowski. Together these gathered musicians resemble a small ceremonial orchestra, their music a tranquil swarm of honeyed drones, fluttering percussion, and unbound, heaven-cast vocals.</em></p><p> 
    Despite the presence of two classic British folk ballads, ""Hangman"" and ""Lowlands"", there is little about <em>Bells that translates as traditional folk. Instead, Directing Hand use these ballads as points of entry into their ecstatic, unclassifiable improvisations, much in the manner of experimental Finnish collectives like Avarus or Kemialliset Ystävät. (Enough so, in fact, to suspect that Neilson might perhaps have some Finnish blood in him somewhere.) Behind these ballads' slender vocal melodies, the ensemble uses a spectacle of ragged strings, bowed cymbals, and shepherd's horns to refract the songs' lyrical, melancholic longing into distinctive and uncommonly tactile new forms.</em></p><p> 
    Prior to these ballads, Directing Hand walk other medieval avenues, as on the solitary drone of the opening invocation ""Beamsley Beacon"", or the splintered Harry Partch rattle of the extended ""Black Herman"". Another peak is reached on ""Tongue of the Bell"", an 11-minute epic that stands as perhaps the purest distillation of the group's peculiar communal power, incorporating skronky European jazz, shimmering vocal chants, and sky-wide metalwork drones into its motley bedlam. Throughout the album, Neilson and the rest of his ensemble perform with the loose, soft-focused attention of a medium awaiting further instructions from beyond. And while there are obviously certain structural limits to this manner of automatic composition, <em>Bells For Augustin Lesage</em> proves Directing Hand capable of tremendous shamanic heights, whoever its ultimate spiritual author might be. </p></div>"|2635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2635-bells-for-augustin-lesage/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

When I last visited, I heard a
    Doors cover band playing a house party overlooking the beach. At the
    time, I was burying myself headfirst in the sand. Okay, the city
    boasts three homegrown serial killers (thank you, <em>Answer Me</em>)
    and my brother told me <em>Killer Klowns From Outer Space</em>'s finale was
    filmed on the Santa Cruz boardwalk, but I've yet to figure out how the
    otherwise mellow enclave inspired Comets On Fire and Residual Echoes
    to beat the stuffing out of fret boards. Guess I ought to investigate
    the next time I'm in town: There must be a darker, brackish stream
    flowing beneath the salted surfers, hippies, coffee shops, and organic
    markets.</p><p>
    
    Whatever their place of origin, Residual Echoes are a fluctuating
    troupe led by Adam Payne, who's earned support and endorsements from Comets' Ethan Miller and Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny. At the time of <em>Phoenician Flu and Ancient Ocean</em>'s
    recording, the live band was a sextet; nowadays, I'm unsure where the
    numbers stand, but judging from how Payne digs into solos and unravels
    instruments, he could muster a bottle-rocket orchestra without outside
    assistance. Imagine MacGyver with a fuzz box.</p><p>
    
    Following the boogie-woogie thrust of the eponymous debut, Payne and
    company spend little time worrying about where songs start or stop:
    Pieces blend and collide into interwoven guitar, horn, bass, piano,
    ""voodoo,"" and ""thunder."" It's tighter, relatively speaking, and more
    downcast than the earlier album. There are seven tracks on the menu-- the first two are strongest.
    Opener ""Death Comes For the Archbishop"" grafts feedbacking
    space-psych with deep-sea excavations (seismic drum shifts and bass
    pulsations). You could fry an egg on some of its licks. The Hendrixian
    blaze is followed by ""Lorelei"", a stoner rock prom theme with fluid soloing.</p><p>
    
    After that, the restlessness begins to feel increasingly rote.
    ""{G}-x-nou(gh) Part II"" is a sludge mountain with thundercrack
    percussion and Monoshock explosives, but it bores. ""Knowe Part I""
    reintroduces, then demos Nick Drake's ""Know"", snuffing out the <em>Pink
    Moon with a 4-track galactic hunt, trumpet overdubs, and the ambience
    of a hurricane sneaking across an ocean floor. ""Greetings Ancient
    Ocean"" is an uninspired, incidentally tender ballad. It made me think
    of Langhorne Slim. Extended closer ""Bleu Eyes""
    incorporates the Carter Family into its flubbed satellite notes,
    ring-tone blues riffs, and jazzy vibes.</em></p><p>
    
    Only a schlep would deny the mightiness of the riffs, but despite
    anarchic aims, <em>Phoenician Flu</em> levels into a
    general flight pattern. In that way, the album (and the band) share a
    tendency with rockers like Pearls &amp; Brass or maybe Cheeseburger, who
    understand dynamics and can appear like brilliant firecrackers in
    small bursts, but over longer hauls have yet to convince me that
    they'll ever surpass pastiche. Residual Echoes' chaotic debut proved
    messes are often incredibly gorgeous, with the code cracked, the formula solved, I
    find it hard to keep listening.</p></div>"|6953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6953-phoenician-flu-and-ancient-ocean/|5.5|Brandon Stosuy

<p><i>Part II</i> shows a marked improvement in his rubbery flow and storytelling      abilities, but is again dragged down by obvious ""Still Tippin""/""Dear      Summer""/""Sittin Sidewayz"" freestyle-flips. <i>Part III</i> is kind of a gag, an      EP-style goof wherein Lupe rocks over beats from Gorillaz's <i>Demon Days</i>.

Unlike on <i>Electric Warrior </i>and<i> </i><i>The Slider</i>, he doesn't punctuate these songs with his constant stream of grunts and yeahs and uh-ahs, so on ""Left Hand Luke"" he sounds as if he's venting it all in one short, supreme outburst. And that's not even the end of the song, which continues for nearly four more minutes as Bolan and his back-up singers milk that gospel refrain for maximum rock grandiosity and project to the ballrooms on Mars.</p>
<p>Definitely triumphant, that yelp is also a little unsettling. It sounds drunkenly desperate, perhaps predicting the artistic and commercial dry spell that would follow <i>Tanx</i> for almost four years, nearly through the end of Bolan's life. This stage of the T. Rex story-- which is chronicled by Rhino's set of eight double-disc reissues, of which these four are the second batch-- has a notorious downward trajectory, as if there was no other place to go after the dizzy heights of what is now persistently referred to as T. Rexstacy, that period during the 70s when Bolan seemed to personify every ideal of rock superstardom in England.</p>
<p>Because he worked with the same basic elements in all his songs-- glam-psychedelic lyrics, glittery 50s rhythms, momentous riffs, midtempo grooves-- it's pretty obvious when Bolan isn't on, although it's often hard to pinpoint the problems. The best term I've been able to come up with is ""mojo,"" which could be broken further down into a formula of fame, drugs, and ego. Bolan's mojo was definitely working during the <i>Tanx </i>period-- look no further than the singles that preceded the album, which are collected as bonus tracks in this reissue. ""Children of the Revolution"" segues effortlessly from <i>The Slider's</i> cocksure stride into one of Bolan's biggest choruses, and ""20th Century Boy"" is a wallop of glam-punk that remains one of the best singles of the decade.</p>
<p>Even so, <i>Tanx</i> proved a difficult album: Bolan was sparring with the other members of T. Rex, his popularity was dwindling, and his narcotic intake was rampant. Furthermore, he wrote all the material essentially in the studio, which wasn't his usual method. As a result, Tanx has a rushed feel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing: ""Mister Mister"" and ""Country Honey"" derive their jittery jump from their impromptu momentum, and the relatively mellow ""Electric Slim and the Factory Hen"" sounds offhandedly arty, its guitar coda swirling into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>That song suggests one possible and intriguing direction in which Bolan might have gone with subsequent albums, but instead of subtle and subdued, he opted for the opposite extreme-- blunt American-style funk. 1974's <i>Zinc Alloy was a bomb, and the following year </i><i>Bolan's Zip Gun</i> was the fallout. A purposeful return to the looser sound of <i>Electric Warrior</i>, <i>Gun</i> fires blanks. For all its directness, the album is mostly perfunctory, working some of the same sounds and ideas, but the results lack movement and liveliness; Bolan's mojo definitely wasn't working. Worse, he really doesn't sound invested in these songs. ""Precious Star"" even borrows its melody from Tommy James and the Shondells' ""Hanky Panky"", and ""Token of My Love"" cribs flagrantly from ""Sea of Love"". The grating ""Think Zinc"" is little more than a billboard from Bolan's previous album. Rougher and rawer, the alternate takes on the second disc vastly improve on these songs, bringing out a charmingly stiff boogie piano on ""Precious Star"" and the popping bass line on ""Light of Love"".</p>
<p>If <i>Zinc Alloy </i>and<i> </i><i>Zip Gun</i> are Bolan's creative nadir and reportedly the peak of his drug use, then 1976's <i>Futuristic Dragon</i> has enough winning moments to suggest an upturn (confirmed by his underrated final album, <i>Dandy in the Underworld</i>, in 1977). Ostensibly some sort of concept album on par with <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>, <i>Dragon</i> begins with a goofy-ass introduction/invocation that actually uses the word raiment unironically, and the instrumental ""Theme for a Dragon"" revives the concept briefly, albeit in title alone. With its canned crowd roar and anthemic riff, the song sounds like Bolan's failed attempt to write his own ""Rock and Roll Part 2"". Ultimately-- and thank god-- the dragon is nothing more than a red herring. Bolan is much more interested in jamming on songs like ""All Alone"", ""New York City"", and especially ""Calling All Destroyers"", and the songs' open-ended grooves rejuvenate the band, even on the bonus-disc alternate takes. <i>Futuristic Dragon</i> blows smoke on its second half, with songs like ""Sensation Boulevard"" and the schlock-disco ""Ride My Wheels"" derailing the first half's chugging momentum. Nevertheless, the album wins your sympathies: It's good enough to make you wish it were better.</p>
<p>Rhino's reissues set concludes with <i>Work in Progress, </i>a two-disk collection of home recordings and studio outtakes. Unlike the bonus tracks on the album disks, these 55 songs, which span Bolan's post-<i>Warrior</i> career, were never released in any form (although ""Bolan's Zip Gun"" would lose its vocals to become ""Theme for a Dragon""). The first disk contains solo performances, mostly Bolan alone strumming his guitar and often adlibbing lyrics; the second and better disk contains studio tracks featuring a full band and back-up singers. Some of the songs are just Bolan screwing around with a riff or a phrase (""Reelin' &amp; A-wheelin' &amp; A-boppin' &amp; A-Bolan"" is nothing but the title repeated over and over, which is more than enough), but most of these tracks are finished songs that reveal a voracious artist enamored with African American music, from blues (""Alligator Man"") and gospel (""Sky Church Music"") to r&amp;b; (""Metropolis Incarnate"") and funk (""Lock into Your Love""), while nodding to his former folksiness (""Is It True?""). The overall tone is one of exuberant experimentation, and songs like ""Bust My Ball"" and ""Savage Beethoven"" have an unguarded glee missing from later albums.</p>
<p>Conversely, Bolan's lack of self-seriousness, especially on the studio tracks, makes <i>Work in Progress sound much more substantial than </i><i>Zinc</i>, <i>Zip, or even </i><i>Dragon</i>. Ostensibly, these recordings weren't meant for public consumption, but I like to think Bolan knew in the back of his mind that these songs would come out eventually, that his stardom would demand it. At times <i>Work in Progress</i> sounds sly and secretive, as if he's using these songs to subvert his prevailing reputation as a glam Icarus, a rockstar cautionary tale.</p>
<p>That fall from grace, however, is only part of the story. Representing roughly half of Bolan's entire output, these six albums and two comps collectively portray an incredibly complex and deeply flawed artist, but they completely omit his early career as half of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Until Rhino or some other label reissues that group's four albums-- hopefully in this same double-disk format, a reissue gold standard-- this story will lack the rise to balance Bolan's fall.</p></div>"|11846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11846-tanx-zip-gun-futuristic-dragon-work-in-progress/|8.3|Stephen M.

Rougher and rawer, the alternate takes on the second disc vastly improve on these songs, bringing out a charmingly stiff boogie piano on ""Precious Star"" and the popping bass line on ""Light of Love"".</p>
<p>If <i>Zinc Alloy </i>and<i> </i><i>Zip Gun</i> are Bolan's creative nadir and reportedly the peak of his drug use, then 1976's <i>Futuristic Dragon</i> has enough winning moments to suggest an upturn (confirmed by his underrated final album, <i>Dandy in the Underworld</i>, in 1977). Ostensibly some sort of concept album on par with <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>, <i>Dragon</i> begins with a goofy-ass introduction/invocation that actually uses the word raiment unironically, and the instrumental ""Theme for a Dragon"" revives the concept briefly, albeit in title alone. With its canned crowd roar and anthemic riff, the song sounds like Bolan's failed attempt to write his own ""Rock and Roll Part 2"". Ultimately-- and thank god-- the dragon is nothing more than a red herring. Bolan is much more interested in jamming on songs like ""All Alone"", ""New York City"", and especially ""Calling All Destroyers"", and the songs' open-ended grooves rejuvenate the band, even on the bonus-disc alternate takes. <i>Futuristic Dragon</i> blows smoke on its second half, with songs like ""Sensation Boulevard"" and the schlock-disco ""Ride My Wheels"" derailing the first half's chugging momentum. Nevertheless, the album wins your sympathies: It's good enough to make you wish it were better.</p>
<p>Rhino's reissues set concludes with <i>Work in Progress, </i>a two-disk collection of home recordings and studio outtakes. Unlike the bonus tracks on the album disks, these 55 songs, which span Bolan's post-<i>Warrior</i> career, were never released in any form (although ""Bolan's Zip Gun"" would lose its vocals to become ""Theme for a Dragon""). The first disk contains solo performances, mostly Bolan alone strumming his guitar and often adlibbing lyrics; the second and better disk contains studio tracks featuring a full band and back-up singers. Some of the songs are just Bolan screwing around with a riff or a phrase (""Reelin' &amp; A-wheelin' &amp; A-boppin' &amp; A-Bolan"" is nothing but the title repeated over and over, which is more than enough), but most of these tracks are finished songs that reveal a voracious artist enamored with African American music, from blues (""Alligator Man"") and gospel (""Sky Church Music"") to r&amp;b; (""Metropolis Incarnate"") and funk (""Lock into Your Love""), while nodding to his former folksiness (""Is It True?""). The overall tone is one of exuberant experimentation, and songs like ""Bust My Ball"" and ""Savage Beethoven"" have an unguarded glee missing from later albums.</p>
<p>Conversely, Bolan's lack of self-seriousness, especially on the studio tracks, makes <i>Work in Progress sound much more substantial than </i><i>Zinc</i>, <i>Zip, or even </i><i>Dragon</i>. Ostensibly, these recordings weren't meant for public consumption, but I like to think Bolan knew in the back of his mind that these songs would come out eventually, that his stardom would demand it. At times <i>Work in Progress</i> sounds sly and secretive, as if he's using these songs to subvert his prevailing reputation as a glam Icarus, a rockstar cautionary tale.</p>
<p>That fall from grace, however, is only part of the story. Representing roughly half of Bolan's entire output, these six albums and two comps collectively portray an incredibly complex and deeply flawed artist, but they completely omit his early career as half of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Until Rhino or some other label reissues that group's four albums-- hopefully in this same double-disk format, a reissue gold standard-- this story will lack the rise to balance Bolan's fall.</p></div>"|11846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11846-tanx-zip-gun-futuristic-dragon-work-in-progress/|5.9|Stephen M.

In their early years, Belle and Sebastian possessed near-totemic powers for their small but impassioned band of disciples, as fervent as the followers of similarly wistful, self-deprecating, and sometimes sexually conflicted artists like the Smiths, Felt, and Orange Juice a decade prior.  The common sacrament was pop, with true believers bearing witness in their communal alienation, badges, battered cassettes, and fanclub memberships.  The Scottish group only heightened that devotion by shrouding themselves in mystery-- not answering questions, not appearing in proper photographs, not available in stores.</p><p>  On sixth proper album <em>The Life Pursuit</em>, Belle and Sebastian want to teach the world to sing, in however imperfect harmony.  Where the recent live re-recording of 1996's <em>If You're Feeling Sinister</em> draped their most appealing songs in apposite finery, the band's latest extends their newfound confidence to content as well as delivery, and stands as the finest full-length by Stuart Murdoch and his shifting collaborators since that distant pinnacle.  About his early-90s recovery from chronic fatigue, Murdoch told a recent interviewer, ""Spirituality and songwriting were my crutches."" Spanning glam, soul, country, and 70s AM rock, this record is a deceptively wry, wickedly tuneful testament to the fragile beauty of faith, in deities as well as in pop.</p><p>  Belle and Sebastian seem to have found new life in their evolution from shy bedsit savants to showy pop adepts. <em>The Life Pursuit</em>'s lavishness renders the burgeoning bubblegum of 2003's Trevor Horn-produced <em>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</em> merely transitional, rewarding the Job-like righteous after the trials of the band's mid-career disappointments. Recorded in Los Angeles with Tony Hoffer, who oversaw Beck's divisive <em>Midnite Vultures</em>, the album runs over with flute, horns, call-and-response vocals, and even a funky clavinet (on soul survivor ""Song for Sunshine""). The playing, meanwhile, is surprisingly chopsy, down to the breezy guitars and Hammond organs-- a far cry from the days when indie meant never having to say you tried.</p><p>  Faith, after all, takes work, and if in one sense <em>The Life Pursuit</em> is about belief in the redemptive power of music, it's also a manifestation thereof.  On opener ""Act of the Apostle, Part One"", a girl with a seriously ill mother imagines an escape, plays the Cat Stevens hymn ""Morning Has Broken"", and contemplates an endless melody before stumbling upon the album's central question: ""What would I do to believe?"" Ostinato bass, splashy piano, and Sarah Martin's gentle harmonies point the way. Toward the end of the album's loose storyline, on ""For the Price of a Cup of Tea"", the heroine seeks solace in ""soul black vinyl,"" as Murdoch channels an irrepressible Bee Gees falsetto.</p><p>  In between the opener and ""Act of the Apostle, Part Two"", nine tracks later, <em>The Life Pursuit</em> sets aside the nascent narrative to offer several of Belle and Sebastian's catchiest pop songs yet. ""The Blues Are Still Blue"" and ""White Collar Boy"" both incorporate glossy T. Rex boogie, Murdoch delivering one of his most indelible hooks on the former and uttering an uncharacteristically soulful ""huh!"" on the latter. Early mp3 preview ""Another Sunny Day"" sounds more like earlier Belle and Sebastian, setting country/western guitar licks to a sunny but sad love song that ambles past soccer, midges, Eskimos, and haunted hearts.  First single ""Funny Little Frog"" slyly relates a love that turns out to be from afar, tellingly comparing the feeling to a sound from the narrator's ""thro-at.""  Sharing its efficient Motown guitar style is the lone Stevie Jackson contribution, ""To Be Myself Completely"", which happily holds its own, observing, ""To be myself completely/ I've just got to let you down.""</p><p>  Still, there's little to fault about this album's songcraft, and Murdoch is also at his best detailing some of his famously quirky characters. ""Sukie in the Graveyard"" makes room for a pristine guitar solo, organs, and horns in a loose, animated tale of a runaway. On melancholic centerpiece ""Dress Up in You"", Murdoch at first seems to be describing an encounter with a groupie, but ultimately is revealed to be singing from the point of view of a woman to a former rival-turned-star.</p><p>  Of course, the album also wrestles with the struggle to have faith in God. To be sure, Murdoch's Christian beliefs have been central to his songs since long before you could say ""Sufjan."" The religious references here have more in common on their face with the <em>Godspell</em> gab of <em>Waitress</em>'s ""If You Find Yourself Caught in Love"" than the sardonically wrought church scenes of ""The State That I Am In"" or ""If You're Feeling Sinister"". Amid atypically fancy guitarwork and Martin's breathless scat on ""We Are the Sleepyheads"", Murdoch recalls, ""We talked about the things we read in Luke and John."" With the feel of Paul McCartney doing Tin Pan Alley, ""Act of the Apostles, Part Two"" finds Murdoch returning to the girl from the introduction. ""The bible's my tool/ There's no mention of school,"" he sighs, then merges the album's twin motifs: ""My Damascan Road's my transistor radio."" Converted to pop, she was converted to Jesus.</p><p>  Though the music may be even shinier and happier than on <em>Waitress</em>, the girl's religious impulses don't resolve themselves nearly so blithely.  Midway through ""Part Two"", the album climaxes when she determines to find ""the face behind the voice"": Synths flutter like stomach butterflies as the melody from ""Part One"" returns and the young protagonist attempts to attend a church service, only to be told to ""bugger off."" Next she places her hopes in music alone, spending the night with a man who makes her ""the village joke."" Closer ""Mornington Crescent""-- named for a London Underground stop and a laughably complex strategy game-- sketches a final fall from grace, giving itself to sin and countrified guitars out of ""Wild Horses"".</p><p>  Only a few bands have managed to successfully reinvent themselves a half-dozen or so albums into their careers. Granted, Murdoch's is a very different group today than the one that caught the ears and hearts of pop-music zealots a decade ago, with different members and a newly unrestrained sound.  ""Make a new cult every day,"" Murdoch once sang, but of course, Heaven's Gate and Waco compounds aren't for everyone.  <em>The Life Pursuit</em> is a baroque pop cathedral, welcoming the faithful and newly converted alike.</p><p> </p></div>"|639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/639-the-life-pursuit/|8.5|Marc Hogan

    Swedish/Argentine singer-songwriter's recordings had made.
    With so much time elapsed between those recordings, it's a little disappointing that the
    follow-up, five-track EP <em>Stay in the Shade</em>, sounds mostly like
    more of the same. The tightly double-tracked
    vocal fjords and sinuous finger-picking remain, as do González's lyrics, which stick mostly to
    Nick Drake's strangely suggestive universals: ""It's warm in the blood/
    Cold in the rain,"" he coos on erstwhile B-side ""Down the Hillside"", an
    incongruously chipper (for Gonzo) ditty about cemeteries. Another
    former flip, ""Sensing Owls"", slows the pace for a tralatitious
    take on mountaintops, coming-outs, and the lack of designated drivers. The biggest changes from
    <em>Veneer</em> are an increased use of hand percussion and less frequent
    bossa nova tinges, so hold onto your knitted hats.</p><p>
    All along, González has been the rare singer-songwriter known more for
    a cover than for his, y'know, songwriting. The centerpiece of
    <em>Veneer</em> was his aching rendition of the Knife's ""Heartbeats"",
    which has since earned him fame and fortune by appearing in a Sony
    commercial and, subsequently, the UK top 10. His sequel of sorts, a cover of Kylie
    Minogue's ""Hand on Your Heart"", deserves credit for its steadfast
    straight-face, though by the end his earnestness, percussive
    guitar-playing and the dopey lyrics have him seeming more like a
    cuddly coffeehouse troubadour along the lines of Matt Wertz or Dave
    Barnes than a haunted lo-fi auteur. Put in terms of
    fellow coverman Mark Kozelek, of Red House Painters and Sun Kil Moon,
    if ""Heartbeats"" was <em>What's Next to the Moon</em> then ""Hand on Your
    Heart"" is closer to <em>Tiny Cities</em>.</p><p>
    Thing is, González's records are more aesthetic than songs. Eerie,
    stripped to the waist, and raining classical guitar; it's a fine style,
    and perfect for bringing the dance-oriented songs of the Knife and
    Kylie to audiences that otherwise might be loath to embrace them. But
    weightless João Gilberto-like singing and delicately plucked Drakeisms will
    only get González so far until his compositions catch up. A closing,
    untitled instrumental features remarkably humble, droning
    guitar-playing and funereal horns. A crowd chatters for its final two
    minutes, as if still waiting for something to begin.</p></div>"|3683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3683-stay-in-the-shade-ep/|6.0|Marc Hogan

This live recording from Finland's Jyrock Festival in April 2003 prioritizes a dogged persistence above flash, slow immersion above quick accessibility-- its 50-odd minutes of unbroken, thematically repeating music sits dauntingly in one long track. <em>3 Dead People After the Performance</em> isn't interested in winning you over; instead, it asks for a commitment.</p><p> 
    
    This isn't surprising coming from ex-Can frontman Damo Suzuki, whose music has always rewarded the long haul more than the sprint. This seems like a continuation of Can's Krautrock legacy, although it's really more of an attenuation-- while the long and fluidly shifting rhythmic and melodic lines are intact, Suzuki is no longer pushing at the boundaries of sonic acceptability. And while Can incorporated electronic music and dub into their languorous rock deconstructions, Damo Suzuki's Network seems to have nostalgically regressed into the rock idiom-- guitars, drums, bass, and vocals are the entire palette here. The music moves like a pendulum, swinging in an ever-increasing arc; the pendulum spinning hypnotically like a golden pocket-watch the size of a wrecking ball. You have to <em>want</em> to get into it; it's not going to do a little soft-shoe for you. As mentioned above, it rewards commitment.</p><p> 
    
    And what does this commitment disgorge? It disgorges gruff, unflashy vocals that mostly stay within the same murky register, reiterating melodic patterns throughout this register like a rudimentary signature. There's a garage-rock warmth to Suzuki's vocals, but their regularity bends them toward the robotic, and when he occasionally drops into a Cookie Monster croak, we're reminded, counterintuitively, of his humanity. It disgorges an athletic rhythm section that seethes and pulses with a minimum of fuss, the compact thrust amplifying the music's sense of inexorability. It disgorges rock guitars that move seamlessly between searing and cooling, between cerebral finagling and rude skronk, but rarely noodle. Indeed, for a record that sounds so excessive on paper, <em>3 Dead People After the Performance</em> is the model of restraint, conveying its incantatory, slowly-unfolding force with the lightest gestures. If it lacks Can's visionary dishevelment, it bears all the marks of a musician decades at his craft-- quiet confidence and effortless poise. </p></div>"|7842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7842-3-dead-people-after-the-performance/|6.5|Brian Howe

Over the next two decades, scattered vanguards
    like Sonic Youth tried the same ploy, but the last few years have seen
    a boom in the audio/multi-media realm. Vying to offer consumers
    bigger bangs in an effort to compete with the all-powerful
    interweb, ambitious acts-- from the Super Furry Animals
    (<em>Rings Around the World</em>) to 50 Cent (<em>The Massacre</em>) to
    Death Cab and their planned web-only video bonanza for
    <em>Plans</em>-- are utilizing sound and vision to hook listeners'
    ADD-addled ears and eyes.</p><p>
    
    Attractive in theory, these ""video albums"" usually don't connect
    thanks to a dearth of great short-film ideas and/or puny
    funding. They can also be artistically tyrannical, taking power away
    from the listener by forcing cemented images upon their psyche instead
    of allowing them to draw individual visual conclusions. This latter
    drawback is especially consequential for a lyric-less artist like Four
    Tet, whose flighty electrorganic hybrids lend themselves to an even
    greater amount of consumer interpretation. To wit, this unnecessary
    addendum to last year's lukewarm <em>Everything Ecstatic</em> LP, a
    set featuring a DVD album along with a five-song, half-hour bonus CD of
    remixes and newbies. Both discs dilute their source material, often
    dimming its dense musical magnetism with annoying, artsy pretensions.</p><p>
    
    Kieran Hebden's previous videos span from haunting and brilliant (the
    ghostly, animated ""My Angel Rocks Back and Forth"") to barely watchable
    (marching band-a-thon ""As Serious As Your Life""), so it's unsurprising that the quality of the clips on <em>Films</em> fluctuate wildly. The
    album's best song, ""Smile Around the Face"", is graciously coupled with
    the DVD's best video. One of Hebden's warmest moments to date is
    affectionately brought to the screen via a bravura performance by
    British actor Mark Heap.</p><p>
    
    The entirety of the day-in-the-life short focuses on Heaps' head as he
    falls down bus stairs, see-saws with his toddler daughter, and finally
    sinks into a soothing bath. Ostensibly wearing a camera harnessed to
    his person (the same magnetizing technique recently employed to great effect by <em>Pi</em> director Darren Aronofsky), the whole thing is a fascinating face study with the middle-aged thespian's worn creases and bluish bruises
    giving the camera gobs to work with. Heap manages to convey the
    heartbreak of a divorced dad, the workman's daily grind, and, lastly,
    the song's titular relieved expression with startling believability,
    making his nameless centerpiece a rare music video character worth
    caring about. Yet most of the DVD's other pieces don't tap into the
    sparkling melancholy prevalent in Hebden's calculated compositions,
    instead vying for silly art-house tomfuckery.</p><p>
    
    ""Sleep, Eat Food, Have Visions"" is an eight-minute slog filled
    with escalating mind-melt noize and parsed pandemonium. It does not
    rank among Four Tet's best moments. Couple it with a video starring
    orange-faced dunces dressed as insects and a pink-painted Hebden
    crazily licking a lollipop in the shape of a panda head and, well,
    it's really just a miracle I watched it straight through once.
    Confoundingly directed by the same man, Woof Wan-Bau, behind the
    striking ""My Angel Rock Back And Forth"" clip, ""Visions"" stinks like a
    how-to for art-school assholes. Poorly filmed and oblique beyond the
    slightest comprehension, it's an ugly piece of wannabe high-art
    filmmaking. The better-looking ""High Fives"" short also relies too much
    on seemingly random symbolism to draw out the song's twinkling
    mystery, with a magical droplet of water causing onlookers to develop
    a second set of eyes directly under their usual pair. Worst of all,
    these failed stabs devalue their accompanying music by locking them in
    with inferior visuals that are tough to shake.</p><p>
    
    The package's <em>Part 2</em> is no better than your typical
    after-the-fact album add-on. Featuring a bottom-feeding melody
    straight out of Frogger, <em>Ecstatic</em>'s two-minute ""Turtle Turtle Up""
    never seemed worthy of a 16-minute stretch-out but that's what we get
    anyway. The EP's one keeper, ""Watching Wavelength"", pumps
    sonar-blip sound science slowly building into a floating piece of
    Fennesz-esque distilled distortion. With the song's
    mechanized core naturally flowing out of a thick murk, it's the type
    of Four Tet song that forces you to follow him.</p><p>
    
    On record, <em>Ecstatic</em> closer ""You Were There With Me"" is a sparse
    exercise in chiming minimalism that hints at a quaint optimism, which is
    beatifically defined in its video counterpart. Directed by
    Hebden and filmed with a hand-held camera, the simplistic work finds his
    significant other spinning and jumping-- arms flailing like
    streamers-- in various locations. That's it. From a waterfall to the
    beach to a forest to a busy New York City street to a record store to
    the middle of the crowd at last year's Pitchfork-curated Festival, she
    twirls. It's loose, joyous, and ecstatic while its sly splendor still
    offers airs of in-between inexplicability. And, for those same
    reasons, it's a noticeable anomaly.</p></div>"|3169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3169-everything-ecstatic-2/|5.8|Ryan Dombal

Numero Group's incomparable Eccentric Soul series has already documented two such labels, Chicago's Bandit and Columbus, Ohio's Capsoul; with the third volume, the label shines a light on Miami's Deep City imprint.  What distinguishes Deep City from most of its mid-60s peers is that, while its own output fell on deaf ears outside of Miami, several people involved with the enterprise eventually found success in the music history.</p><p>
    
    Deep City essentially laid the groundwork for Henry Stone's T.K. imprint, honed Willie Clarke's production skills, and discovered Betty Wright, Paul Kelly, and Clarence ""Blowfly"" Reid.  The label's Criteria Studio also played host to giants like Wilson Pickett, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin-- closer brushes with fame than most shoestring-budget soul labels enjoyed.  Many of the musicians who played on these recordings cut their teeth in Florida A&amp;M; University's ""Incomparable Marching 100"" band, and you can hear that discipline in the comp's solid backing tracks, wicked horn arrangements, and complex drumming.</p><p>
    
    For their parts, Clarke and label co-founder Johnny Pearsall were moonlighters, working at a local middle school (Clarke taught art, Pearsall was an administrator), while arranger Arnold Albury was a music teacher and Incomparable Marching 100 alum.  From the beginning, Deep City had the potential for national success, hitching its wagon to should-have-been-a-star Helene Smith.  Smith had a sweet, rangey voice not dissimilar to Mary Wells, and her five songs here reveal a remarkably developed talent.  In particular, ""You Got to Do Your Share"" and the spacey ""I Am Controlled By Your Love"", with its chinking guitars, deliciously nuanced lead, and heavenly backing vocals, deserved a much-larger audience.</p><p>
    
    Those backing vocals were provided by the Moovers, an amazing harmony soul combo who crop up several times on the compilation, most notably on ""One Little Dance"" and ""Someone to Fulfill My Needs"", the latter a spooky crawler full of great harmonies and sumptuously deep bass.  The previously unreleased Moovers track ""Darling I'll Go"", lifted by Numero Group from acetate, kicks off with an intro that sounds like a cousin to the Skatalites' ""Addis Ababa"", offering the starkest indication of the label's proximity to Jamaica.  Though the occasional Latin influence does pop up in the rhythm section, Motown and the then-burgeoning sound of Southern soul are far more dominant touchstones.</p><p>
    
    The Southern soul influence is most apparent on Johnny K. Killens &amp; The Dynamites' driving proto-funk cut ""I Don't Need Help"", which features drier production than most of what surrounds it. More difficult to classify is the opening cut, Them Two's ""Am I a Good Man"".  The song is a smoky masterpiece of tortured soul, with a huge bassline pulling it through its various movements while Smith's ghostly backing vocals coax the dual lead vocalists to a cold sweat.  The song also makes it clear how superb Numero Group's remastering job is-- the production is traceable to its time, but the sound quality and depth of field is thoroughly modern.  Coupled with the extensive liners and photographs, this is what sets Numero apart from other reissue labels.</p><p>
    
    The final chapter of the brief Deep City story-- the label only lasted from 1964 to 1968-- is a classic music industry falling-out tale.  By 1967, Pearsall was married to Smith, who was enjoying her status as Miami's queen of soul, and the introduction of Betty Wright to the label's roster, such as it was, did not go over well.  The tracks Wright waxed for Deep City are uniformly astounding, her voice brimming with passion, and had personal politics not interfered, she and Smith would have made a formidable pair.  The result of a prospective competition between the two for supremacy at the label is another tantalizing what-if.</p><p>
    
    As it happened, Pearsall refused to work with Wright, and Reid (who wrote, produced, and played sessions for Deep City) exited with Clarke and Wright, leaving Pearsall to finish the label's run with a Helene Smith LP that collected all of her sides.  For Pearsall and Smith, it was the end of their involvement in music, while many of the other players in the Deep City story went on to success in the disco era or remained active as session players in Miami.  Though their paths ultimately diverged, the music they were responsible for at Deep City was truly among the best small-label soul of the 60s, and here it's well-preserved, presented in beautiful packaging with remastered sound, and for once, receiving national distribution.</p></div>"|2079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2079-eccentric-soul-the-deep-city-label/|8.7|Joe Tangari

    connected to traditional Appalachian folk, blues, and country, genres we tend
    to think of as quintessentially American. It seems, though, that in the past
    half-century, the essence of American-ness has changed-- or rather,
    expanded-- to the point where the word Americana only captures a tiny part of
    what makes American life and culture distinctive. I'm not suggesting that we
    redefine a semi-useful critical tag, but I'd like to posit that the
    Caribbean's music is a sort of Americana, albeit a different sort than we're
    used to.</p><p>
    
    The simple fact is that in 50 years, the stuff that this band sings
    about-- office supplies, airport security, long-distance correspondence, and
    dayjob malaise-- will likely be more central to American life than coal
    mining, farming, and church. That's if they're not already. Songs about
    crime, another staple of Americana, will probably still resonate far and
    wide, and the Caribbean simply updates that, from murder ballads to
    small-time drug production and white-collar dishonesty.</p><p>
    
    The D.C. band wraps its tales of modern life in a musical cocktail that arranges piles of instruments into a constantly
    shifting mix. Guitars, marimbas, beatboxes, banjos, drums, violins, and
    accordions share air with turntables, radios and samplers, which add a touch
    of modern glitch to the otherwise smooth, spacious arrangements. Producer
    Chad Clark keeps all these elements from stepping on each other, giving the
    band a roomy sound that comes across like an alternate-universe Death Cab.
    Michael Kentoff's soft, Ira Kaplan-ish vocals wander through these elements
    like one person through a towering city, as if awed by everything they see
    and hoping not to get lost.</p><p>
    
    This fact and the band's singularly odd way with lyrics make <em>Plastic
    Explosives</em> nearly impossible to sing along to-- none of the songs are arranged
    in convenient verse-chorus-verse packages, instead flowing from thought to
    thought in mostly complete sentences. It can get awkward at times-- try
    putting a melody to ""As we ripped out our networks, I kept it in mind: Save
    the mirror or else pretty soon you'll find you can't see/ You can't hear"" and
    see how far you get. Kentoff's lyrics are at their best on ""The Truth Hurts
    Jamie Green"", which that tells the story of a girl adrift with just a few
    fractured images, the best being the last: ""A voice assumed buried rang on
    another line.""</p><p>
    
    The songs here have an uncanny flow from one to the next, to the
    point where they feel indelibly joined, a feeling heightened by the little
    sketchy instrumentals that cushion them from each other like sonic packing
    peanuts. After three albums and a couple of EPs, the Caribbean sound
    at home in this strange little white-collar rock place they've built for
    themselves. It's the folk music of the new American service economy.</p></div>"|1310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1310-plastic-explosives/|7.2|Joe Tangari

Doughman's wiry enthusiasm and exaggerated crooning was met with indifference, and as a last-ditch effort, he pulled out a song that he ""wrote during his boyhood days in Manchester."" His languid, skeletal cover of ""Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want"" just...bombed, spectacularly, worse than any supposed crowd concession I'd seen before. A few two-minute tracks, half-hearted yowls, and overcompensating heel-clicking leaps later, Doughman and his drummer receded from the stage to little fanfare.</p><p>
    
    I admired Doughman's chutzpah enough to pick up the band's surprisingly consistent <em>This Flag Signals Goodbye</em>, to stick with it through to the solipsistic slow numbers to blare its scrappy, unadorned anthems. The follow-up is <em>Last Night Becomes This Morning, and it's armed with a bevy of clever song titles and an intertextual suggestion from Doughman likening the record to a struggling indie musician's <i>Running on Empty</i></em>, songs about maintaining the touring-band lifestyle in the face of apathy. While I'd love to say this is the album that breaks the holding pattern, <em>Last Night</em> holds a palm full of surprises and otherwise stretches the underdog charm a little thin.</p><p>
     
    The only atmosphere <em>Last Night</em> conjures is isolation; the only emotional setting is defeat. Hell, it opens with a song called ""Losing the Battle, Losing the War"". Even numbers that run up the party flag, such as ""Waterloo Crescent"", sound deflated somehow. If you're gonna set yourself up to love this record, you'll have to bring considerable patience and savor every small detail Doughman tosses out as lifelines to his songs. Dig the vintage organ tones, the sneaky 10-second pre-chorus on ""Timing Is Everything"", that song's trumpets and piano-- always one at a time, however, as if he's sprinting across the studio to finish each part.</p><p> 
    
    Still, ""Timing"" is the closest to a full band sound that <em>Last Night</em> gets. Most songs are spiced up through either carefully applied double-tracked vocals (""Slave to the Kettle"" and the brief but near-perfect lullaby ""Done in a Hurry""), or with overbearing empty-studio echo that recall a sparsely attended performance and reinforce the crushing loneliness of life on the road, maaaaaan (""This is Not How Forever Begins"", ""Time Zones and Area Codes"", and ""Ten Dollars""). </p><p> 
    
    Which is fine; I couldn't think of an approach that suits Swearing at Motorists better. <em>This Flag Signals Goodbye</em> had songs, though, with arrangements and melodies that lived and breathed on their own regardless of lyrics. The tracks on <em>Last Night</em> serve the theme before all else and, barring a few bold highlights, skimp on the rest.</p></div>"|7651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7651-last-night-becomes-this-morning/|6.9|Jason Crock

It's time-honored and universal, spanning almost all backgrounds, professions, and upbringings, and those who gave up on following music before the compact disc era are as likely to have a copy lying around as those who just got into the Velvets at school last year.  <em>Legend</em>, for many, <em>is</em> reggae; the genre begins with ""Could You Be Loved"" and ends with ""Jamming"".  But as weathered and worn-out as this compilation has become-- and man, am I tired of it-- it didn't attain its stature by force of marketing.  Marley wrote accessible, all-embracing songs, had a radiant voice, and backed himself with great bands.  The problem with <em>Legend</em> is not that people love it, but what that love means to Island Records, and how it translates to <i>Africa Unite</i>, their recent repackaging of the compilation.</p><p>
    
    Eleven of <em>Legend</em>'s 14 songs appear here, meaning those whom this collection is directly aimed at already own most of it.  Granted, beyond those 11 are nine new cuts for the casual fan, but then two of these are simply slight remixes that few will find enticing.  Black-Eyed Peas' will.i.am, for example, was given the nod to update the compilation's title song, but his clumsy programmed drums are mixed much too high and fail to deliver the intended effect of bringing the track up to date.  ""Stand Up Jamrock"" finds Ashley Beedle mashing up ""Get Up Stand Up"" with brief snippets of Damian Marley's ""Welcome to Jamrock"", which may make some sense thematically but drains life from both tunes.  If anything, it's a reminder that, yeah, ""Jamrock"" would sound pretty good right about now.</p><p>
<em>Africa Unite</em>'s biggest draw-- and likely the only real incentive for its release-- is the new song ""Slogans"", which was pieced together ""Free as a Bird""-style by adding a full band to an acoustic demo Marley cut in a hotel room in 1979.  ""Slogans"" is a nice song, and its backing arrangements, assembled under the direction of Stephen and David Marley, integrates it well into the catalog.  The production faithfully replicates the careful (some would say overly slick) studio sound of his late-70s years at Island, with Eric Clapton adding some restrained fills that threaten to get in the way but never quite do.</p><p>
    
    But even if this material tacked onto <i>Africa Unite</i>'s second half serves as the compilation's impetus, the disc's first track points toward the real area of exploration for Marley neophytes.  This compilation is the first ever to combine pre-Island recordings with the material that made Marley a household name.  And the opening ""Soul Rebel"", which Bob and the Wailers cut with Lee ""Scratch"" Perry at the boards, hasn't lost a bit of its earthy appeal.  <em>The Complete Upsetter Singles is the place those made curious by familiar Marley hits should look next.  Download ""Slogans"" somewhere-- it's worth the 99 cents-- and then set your sights for Scratch-produced sides like ""Small Axe"" and ""Mister Brown"".</em></p></div>"|5673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5673-africa-unite-the-singles-collection/|7.0|Mark Richardson

    Villalobos"" appear in six out of the eight ""Month in Techno"" features Big Phil Sherburne penned for this site in the year 2005. I can't find anyone else who approaches that. Not Dominik ""K-hole"" Eulberg. Not Michael 
    ""International DJ Superstar"" Mayer. Not Hans-Peter ""Space Disconaut"" 
    Lindstrom. Apparently in 2005, the geist of techno swung to Mr. Villalobos, <em>brittle zeit.</em></p><p>
    As the person most responsible for ""ketamine house,"" sweet Ricardo 
    has been chasing his personal white rabbit down any number of holes for the 
    last few years now. (On record, of course.) <em>Alcachofa</em> redrew ""jazzy 
    house"" with a broken piece of charcoal. <em>Thè au Harem d'Archiméde</em> 
    approached drooling stasis through geologic repetitions. And in 2005 he 
    seemed to have given up on the album format entirely, producing a series of 
    singles that stretch right to the lip of the vinyl, unafraid of what goes on over the edge. Mssr. Sherburne has already commented that if you could get more than 15 minutes of decent sound on a vinyl single, Villalobos would just keep going and going and going.</p><p>
    Slipping out in the last weeks of December and at just a hair under 50 
    minutes, <em>Achso</em> is not an EP. The only thing that has kept it from 
    receiving the same attention as Villalobos' two albums is form: a vinyl 
    double-pack in an era where many music hipsters have given up even CDs. This is a shame because it might be his best work.</p><p>
    ""Ichso"" opens as a rustle of hi-hats, clipped male grunts, and a snaking, 
    almost Native American melody. Less than a minute in, a more 
    sure-footed and jacking rhythm drops. The melody becomes a chiming guitar 
    pricking a handful of nylon notes, and back again. Then, after two minutes, 
    he does the wholly unexpected and throws in a breakbeat-like kick, turning 
    this swirl of tiny things nearly club-ready. A distorted chord clangs around five minutes in as the drums become more agitated and the guitar peals. Everything drops out at around seven minutes for a stretch of bass and drum that sounds like desiccated UK garage strafed by intermittent Death Star fire. By minute nine it's a sea of percussive onomatopoeia as the melody reappears. Then the whole thing slows to half time until fade out, a Timbaland rhythm pattern happily chewed on by Perlon grubs and mites.</p><p>
    That's just the first track.</p><p>
    And so it goes. ""Duso"" strings Orientalist guitar runs (that sound like they were recorded with an underwater microphone) through a now trademark 
    Villalobos percolating groove, heavy on the hollow kick drum and gurgling 
    off-beats. Halfway through he treats us to elephants stomping bubble wrap in an empty warehouse. Rusty screen doors shudder in the wind and dot matrix printers crank. ""Erso"" is a chiming sea of fizzy chirps and ISDN line noise like breakers against a shoreline. (Or, if I wanted to be reductive, a dancefloor Autechre.) At the four-minute mark, everything gets farty and it's the most cheerful thing the man has put his name to. ""Sieso"" is a percussive monster: Sizzles like grease popping from a frying pan, big ugly hammering klangs, contact mic'd dragonfly flutter, all held together by the thinnest Aphexian lunar melody that gorgeously modulates throughout. 
    Patterns are constantly reshuffled, new ticks and tocks and tsssh's. More 
    beats (or beat <em>sounds</em>) per bar than some dance producers manage in an entire career.</p><p>
<em>Achso</em> is minimal because it doesn't announce itself with big riffs or overt melodies, and it's ""minimal"" because that's where it gets slotted in stores. But there's more going on in these four sides than the entire Get Physical catalog. I have no idea if these records would work in any club context; my instincts tell me no. But in a genre that often holds up 
    anonymity as an aesthetic virtue, Villalobos records are as immediately 
    recognizable as a Stereolab single, as considered as Morton Feldman, and as 
    expansive as John Coltrane. Say whatever you will: He's the first true 
    genius 21st century techno has produced.</p></div>"|8508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8508-achso/|8.9|Jess Harvell

A visionary drummer with a CV dating back to the early 1960s, Reid has an epic backstory that would make crate diggers swoon: Self-taught Motown session player. In-house drummer at the Apollo Theater. Jailed during Vietnam as a conscientious objector. Member of Sun Ra's Arkestra. A teenaged sojourn through Africa resulting in a stint with Fela. Four roiling, passionate records-- limited to just 1,000 pressings each, filed under the loosely-defined <u><a href=""http://www.freeform.org/music/kozmigroov-defined.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kosmigroov</a></u> genre-- released on his own Bronx-based Mustevic Sound label from 1975 -79. After Reid's 20-plus years off the map, it's a minor miracle that the spelunkers at Soul Jazz unearthed his <em>Rhythmatism and <i>Nova</i></em> albums for reissue in 2004. And it's nothing short of divine intervention that Reid, who now makes his home in Switzerland, recently found a kindred spirit in Four Tet's Kieren Hebden.</p><p>
    
    The two have been collaborating since a series of European performances in early 2005. Hebden plays a minor yet important role in Reid's latest, <i>Spirit Walk</i>: As part of an eight-man ensemble that includes Reid's propulsive drums, tenor, soprano, and bass saxophones, a vast array of keyboards, and upright bass, Hebden's interjections add luminous filigree to a sound galvanized by bottom-end groove. It's a next-gen enrichment of Reid's earlier work, much of which was marked by acoustic instrumentation and less ornate, more syncopated spaciousness. That kind of digital detailing renders <i>Spirit Walk</i> at once timeless and totally in the moment, stretching out towards jazz's greatest potential.</p><p>
    
    Take the steamrolling ""Lions of Juda""-- a track Reid revisits from <em>Nova</em>. Where the previous version was played with hectic urgency, this one rumbles along with a commanding, marshal steadiness. Hebden stitches a glitchy silver lining around the rest of the band, his minimal electronic deviance emphasizing rather than obscuring the music's sanguine, organic heart. ""Bridget"" and ""Which One?"" are likewise illuminated, while bellicose bass sax argues with bubbly electric organ or righteous soprano horn, landing somewhere between Afrobeat's dark march, <i>Bitches Brew-style incantation, and Yesterday's New Quintet's streetwise shuffle. </i></p><p>
    
    Melody occasionally takes the reigns, even as Reid's percussive cantor and bassist John Edward's hearty upright bass stay the course. Album opener ""Lugano"", with its reverent alto line, or the gurgling, tumbling staggers of 23-year-old Russian keysman Boris Netsvetaev on the apt-named ""For Coltrane"", both highlight sweet, yearning progressions. These are songs that could've come from Pharaoh Sanders' <em>Karma period, minus the discord, or Trane's <i>Crescent</i></em>-era recordings, but Reid tethers these spiritual flights with a rhythmic root that's both supple and strong. </p><p>
<em>Spirit Walk</em>'s one misstep is ""Drum Story"", an overlong, spoken-word ode to the history of percussion recited by Reid himself. There's no need for hindsight here-- thanks to its coy foreplay with Four Tet, Reid's music is going nowhere but forward. </p></div>"|6931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6931-spirit-walk/|7.8|Jonathan Zwickel

Had this collection appeared just a few short years ago, Grimm's idiosyncratic form of rustic Appalachian folk might've sounded like a garbled transmission from another century, if not another world. As it stands, however, <em>Harpoon</em> is instead at risk of seeming downright commonplace, submerged beneath the onrushing tide of similarly constructed free-folk deviations. Yet it would be a mistake to overlook Grimm's wondrous, exotic creations simply due to the unfortunate timing of her album's arrival, just as it would be to dismiss this transfixing album as the work of a carpetbagger.</p><p>
    
    Based in Providence, R.I., Grimm is a former member of the Dirty Projectors-- information that does little to prepare the listener for the delicate, highly stylized folk of <em>Harpoon</em>. Guiding her way with little more than guitar, dulcimer, and multi-tracked vocals, Grimm here quilts together Born Heller's icy, backwoods songcraft, Jana Hunter's homespun, lo-fi shimmer, and the ecstatic vocal peaks of Christina Carter. Thanks in part to Sophie Dixon's ornate, hand-drawn artwork, <em>Harpoon</em> also bears marked resemblance to the gothic folk of musician and comic artist Dame Darcy. And though the album is comprised entirely of original material, the influence of Grimm's roots in the Georgia foothills frequently creep through, lending the music a deep-set, handed-down fiber that sounds at once staunchly traditional yet still somehow quite unearthly.</p><p>
    
    On ""Pigeon Food"", Grimm puts down a melody as pure and ancient as rainwater; sung in the sweet, artless manner of someone out hanging wash on the line, with only her eccentric multi-tracked chorus to date it as a modern recording. Things soon come decidedly more unraveled on the lengthy ""Future Friend"", when her layered encircling vocals descend like a flock of barn swallows and carry off the back-porch. Stranger still is ""Harpoon Baptism"", a incisive portrait of heartsick longing that eventually culminates with Grimm channeling various animal noises, witch cackles, and spirited inhuman howls. </p><p>
    
    Music this singular and possessed seems to demand lyrics to match, but unfortunately the slim narratives of Grimm's ballads and ill-starred romantic chronicles often fail to meet the mark. Cryptic, out-of-time pieces like the opening ""Entrance"", shudder to a halt behind such earthbound lines as ""I would follow him anywhere he wants me to/ And I would sing for him in a crowd of New York hipsters."" Throughout the album, Grimm's lyrics are too consistently forlorn and lovestruck to doubt their sincerity, and as such she proves able to deliver them with an extraordinary breadth of conflicting passions. One only hopes that next time her themes prove ageless enough to better equal the live-wire magic inherent within her radiant music. </p></div>"|3689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3689-harpoon/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

Grumpy people call it the worst sort of recycling (last night's Cheez Whiz, <i>microwaved</i>), as if dance music hasn't been pulling gems from that mine since forever. But the track works, stomping beautifully through the commercial universe: Friday-night megamixes on the top-40 station, stereo demo discs at Best Buy, end-of-night hugs between the older guys at the less-cool gay bar. A few months later: We get mix after mix of other people's hi-NRG takes on squishy 80s ballads, right down to Cutting Crew.</p><p>
    
    Moral of story: Drunk people like to do a lot of things, but ""dance"" and ""emote along with familiar songs"" are both near the top of the list. Stuff like this takes shortcuts to both, and grumps who imagine the phenomenon is limited to shopping malls have another think coming. Diplo and Hollertronix have been known to do indie versions of the same thing, bulking up the beats behind hip staples from Siouxsie and the Banshees, Talking Heads, the Cure, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Rock bands release full-length remix albums. Interpol hook up with Arthur Baker. People have been pointing this out since 2001: Folks nowadays want to dance and listen to indie at the same time, and low-budget mashups and endless spins of ""Blue Monday"" don't seem to be cutting it.</p><p>
    
    Yeah, well: Whether it's DJ Sammy action or dancing-to-indie, there are better ways to fill the gap than <i>Future Retro</i>, a discful of middling remixes of hip-friendly 80s-ish tracks from the WEA back catalog-- many of which were not exactly in need of reconfiguring. To their credit, these revamps are largely pretty competent, and they're mostly ""deep"" mixes, putting together all-new, all-functional, all-modern backings for the familiar vocals to migrate to. Some people will have professional reasons for needing that kind of translation-- say, commercial DJs who for some reason want a version of Erasure's ""A Little Respect"" they can work into electronic house sets. Some of them are even decent on their own. Elite Force's chunky-funk take on ""White Lines"" is a solid track without too much connection to the original. The Crystal Method take ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" and Richard X takes Yaz's ""Situation""; both know well enough to add a little energy and then leave things alone.</p><p>
    
    But for you, the end-user listener: Exactly what was missing from dancing to Erasure in the first place? (Or ""Situation"", or the Cure's ""The Walk"", or ""Bizarre Love Triangle?"") The limited usefulness only points to the problem with the all-function translations here: Hardly any of them do much to bring anything new to the material, anything beyond dressing them up for an ever-so-slightly different social occasion. Some of them can't even manage <i>that</i> very well: Jaded Alliance make a harmonic mess of ""A Little Respect"", Alphaville's ""Forever Young"" gets a cheeseball post-""Heaven"" treatment, and the mix of INXS's ""Need You Tonight"" on here bugs me on levels I'm not even prepared to plumb. The treats at the end-- a big motorik drone over B-Movie's ""Nowhere Girl"", and church-organ cut-up fun with Morrissey's ""Suedehead""-- are way too little, way too late, and may even only sound good by comparison.</p><p>
    
    And all this now, with so much good new dance music in the world? Trust me: It's the last thing you need.</p></div>"|1974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1974-future-retro/|3.9|Nitsuh Abebe

While history tends to place the strongest significance on the musical achievements of the Tropicálistas, the movement bridged all mediums-- poetry, film, and theater all felt its influence.  Tropicália was fraught with political tension as well, embodying the anger, anxieties, and desires of the Brazilian left, which was then struggling under the Brazilian military's oppressive rule, a junta that lasted from 1964 to 1985.  Tom Zé, a major figure within the movement, put it bluntly: ""I don't make art; I make spoken and sung journalism.""</p><p>
    Naturally, this overt radicalism greatly limited the movement's lifetime: In 1969, two of Tropicália's most admired personalities, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, were jailed for their dissension.  Remarkably, this circumstance prevented neither from releasing albums that year; they simply recorded vocal tracks in their cells and sent the tapes to their associates for embellishment.  Upon their release from government custody, however, both artists left the country for England, and by the early 1970s, Tropicália had more or less run its course, giving way to the less extreme but similarly striking sounds of Musica Popular Brasileiro.</p><p>
    Soul Jazz's new <em>Tropicália: A Brazilian Revolution in Sound</em> compilation takes an extremely focused look at six of the most important and influential Tropicália artists, bringing together material from the movement's 1968-70 heyday for a superb 20-song anthology of one of the 20th century's most unique musical moments.  Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, Os Mutantes, Caetano Veloso, Tom Zé, and Jorge Ben are responsible for some of the most bracing records Brazil ever produced-- and though omissions are certain to be an issue for cratedigging obsessives, this collection is as flawless a primer as has ever been made available on a single disc.</p><p>
    The compilers made an interesting decision when they opted to bookend the compilation with two different versions of ""Bat Macumba""-- one by Os Mutantes, the other a collaboration between that band and Gilberto Gil.  The two versions do go a long way toward illustrating the extremes of the movement-- Gil's is a sleek, propulsive groove machine topped with a wicked sitar lead, while the Mutantes transform the song into a sloppy psychedelic pile-up of Bahian drumming and spasmodic fuzz guitar-- but this also means that Veloso's literally genre-defining ""Tropicália"", from his 1968 self-titled album, winds up at track 13, which doesn't really feel right.</p><p>
    As the opener of Veloso's first self-titled album, ""Tropicália"" was a blast across the bow of complacency in Brazilian popular music, which by then had already been inching toward explosive change for a few years.  The song opens with a flutter of scraped violin strings, ringing bells, congas, and spoken narration before congealing into a swelling, stop/start verse, which is
    balanced by a charging, sing-song chorus.  Veloso's other tracks here were all conceived and recorded behind prison walls: ""Irene"" is deceptively placid, with acoustic guitar and shaker backed by genius arranger Rogério Duprat's deftly scored horns and flutes.  Of course, the seemingly innocent line ""I want to hear Irene laughing"" is much darker: Irene was the nickname for criminal and leftist icon TexF3rio Cavalcanti's machine gun.</p><p>
    Radical politics are replaced by radical production techniques on Os Mutantes' ingenious ""Panis et Circenses"", a wild tape collage littered with horn fanfares that finds the band repeatedly fading in and out, and even slows the end of one verse to an abstract smear.  They play it straighter on the outstanding ""Quem Tem Medo de Brincar de Amor"", which has a chorus that could vie with any French pop of the period for sheer sophistication, Rita Lee's breathy croon blending effortlessly with the harmonies of the Baptista brothers.  Meanwhile, Gal Costa's ""Tuareg"", drawn from her outrageously strange second self-titled album, mixes Brazilian rhythms with Saharan harmonies and instrumentation, using pentatonic oboe figures and oud licks to anchor the melody.  On ""Sebastiana"", she switches gears from breathy to bizarre, breaking into a weird throat rattle near the end of the first verse.</p><p>
    A number of moments here simply rock: The opening of Gil's ""Procissao"" features an incredible guitar solo over a chord sequence that foreshadows Paul Simon's ""Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"" by two years, while Zé's ""Jimmy, Renda Se"" rides a killer descending guitar riff and strutting funk beat, sounding like a blueprint for Jorge Ben's 1970 classic ""Ponta de Lanca Africano"".</p><p>
    Solid as <i>Tropicália</i>'s tracklist is, though, it's hard not to miss anthems like ""Baby"", ""Parque Industrial"", ""Alegria, Alegria!!!"", and ""Pais Tropical"", calling into question whether this compilation would have been better served with the inclusion of an additional disc.  But then, that may also have been too ambitious an undertaking for newcomers, and of course, each is available for tracking down in its own right for anyone interested in further exploring this music.  And if you do want to seek out an additional introductory disc, you can always pick up the landmark 1968 compilation <em>Tropicália: Ou Panis et Circenses</em>, with which the Soul Jazz set only shares in common two tracks.</p><p>
    There are artists whom one could argue deserve inclusion on this kind of Tropicália overview-- Chico Buarque, Maria Bethânia, Lo Borges, and MPB4 come to mind-- as does the solo work of Rita Lee and Rogério Duprat, and also Wilson Simonal, whose ""pilantragem"" (roughly, ""piracy"") style and four-volume <em>Alegria, Alegria!!!</em> series laid some important musical groundwork for the movement.  Still, Soul Jazz's decision to hone its focus actually results in an overall sharper, more unified collection than such cobbling together could provide.  As such, <em>Tropicália: A Brazilian Revolution in Sound</em> seems the obvious starting point for anyone who's ever been curious about the movement, but found the array of difficult-to-find and often expensive albums too bewildering to approach.</p></div>"|1997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1997-tropicalia-a-brazilian-revolution-in-sound/|9.5|Joe Tangari

    generic death metal quartet Black Death.  Their debut as Darkthrone, <i>Soulside Journey, was released in 1990, but it wasn't until they fell under the thrall of Mayhem, Bathory, and
    Celtic Frost-- and busted out the corpsepaint-- that they found their own path.  Second album <em>A Blaze in the Northern Sky</em></i> (1991) is therefore considered to be the group's first true statement, and along with <em>Under a Funeral Moon</em> (1993) and <em>Transilvanian Hunger</em> (1994), one-third of the band's classic trio of records.  (To get a sense of the early sound, neophytes should check out <em>A Blaze's ""Kathaarian Life Code"", <i>Transilvanian Hunger</i></em>'s title track, and ""The Dance of Eternal Shadows"" from <em>Funeral Moon</em>.)</p><p>
    During this period, the band recorded songs with lyrics by Burzum's Varg Vikernes, who was famously found guilty of three counts of arson for burning churches and is currently incarcerated for the murder of Mayhem bandmate Euronymous.  Now an Odalist, Vikernes was once an outspoken proponent of neo-Nazism and fascism.  Although Darkthrone never openly shared his violent tendencies, they did include the following statement in a <i>Transilvanian Hunger</i> press release: ""We would like to state that <em>Transilvanian Hunger stands beyond any criticism. If any man should attempt to criticize this LP, he should be thoroughly patronized for his obviously Jewish behavior.""  They later retracted it at the label's urging and today purport to take an apolitical stance, but the cloud remains.</em></p><p>
    A duo since <em>Transilvanian Hunger, drummer/vocalist/main lyricist Fenriz and guitarist/bassist/vocalist Nocturno Culto are still ruffling feathers, albeit in a less alarming fashion. ""Too Old Too Cold"", the single for Darkthrone's upcoming 12th album, </em><em>The Cult Is Alive</em>, is a ""death to false metal"" call to arms.  Playing punk riffs in the realm of Turbonegro, Culto grumbles, ""Nothing to prove/ Just a hellish rock-n-roll freak/ You call your metal black/ It's just spastic, lame, and weak.""  It's their catchiest song to date, though it completely lacks the evil ambiance of earlier classics.  Okay, let the black metal webboards argue about whether or not Motörhead, Crass, and Exploited-like Darkthrone is still the real deal; the band's own site is ambiguous about the whole thing: ""We are still performing metal. Blackmetal you say? well, yeah, maybe, depends on who is listening."" Ah, Stanley Fish would be proud.</p><p>
    It's interesting to ponder where the band's going with this newer, more accessible sound.  There are a few issues that may concern diehards: <em>Too Old, Too Cold is their first ever single, and they're also releasing their first ever video for it.  The four songs included here, recorded in the band's home studio, are crisper than anything they've done.  In the past, Darkthrone intentionally deconstructed their technical skills and recorded on lo-fi equipment, questing for a certain purity in their approach-- and this?  These tracks are less technically interesting than past efforts, but they offer more oomph than 2004's middling </em><em>Sardonic Wrath</em>.</p><p>
    We're also treated to the band's first cover, a Danzig-esque remake of Siouxsie and the Banshees' ""Love In a Void"".  It's fun to hear Siouxsie's haunting ""too many bigots for my liking/ Too many critics... too few writing/ Rabid dogs that just ain't biting"" transformed into something both violent and dorkily Viking-esque, but the reworking pales in comparison to the original. The best track is ""High on Cold War"", largely because of the shredding guest vocals by Enslaved's Grutle Kjellson, who tackles the first two verses with Culto taking over after that.  The EP closes with the Celtic Frost-ish ""Graveyard Slut"" with Culto on vocals.</p><p>
    There are moments to savor, but all in all, the four tracks are largely unremarkable. Still, I'm inordinately excited about <em>The Cult Is Alive</em> for one reason: Darkthrone recorded its best material for Peaceville then left the label in 1994; ever the romantic, their return to the label strikes me as an almost symbolic move. (Either that, or smart marketing: Peaceville also reissued the 2001 best-of compilation, <em>Preparing for War</em>, as a box set complete with a bonus CD of extra demos and a DVD of live performances and interviews.)  So, unless you're a diehard, then, it may be wise to steer clear of this single and sleep with one eye open until the release of <em>The Cult Is Alive</em>.</p></div>"|2634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2634-too-old-too-cold-ep/|6.2|Brandon Stosuy

As it turns out, this ain't another <em>Romance Bloody Romance</em>-style money grab, or feckless quest for some intangible fountain-of-youth a la <em>Guerolito</em>.  The disc's cadre of first-tier producers-- including Vitalic, Anders Trentemøller, and Jacques Lu Cont-- send the original track, already an album highlight, through their own signature portals, and the fun lies in each transformation's unique results.</p><p>
    Anders Trentemøller's jagged slice of psychosis earns flagship status here.  The Knife's Karin Dreijer pulls an impressive faux-Björk on vocals, and Trentemøller's mercilessly mechanical rhythm section leaves her forsaken in a dehumanized world.  Even during the bridge, during which all accompaniment drops out-- save a viscous, meaty bassline-- Dreijer's voice rings metallic, eventually scraping up against a gnashing string section.  Psychologically, the song rings true to Röyksopp's more organic, soft-edged original, greatly contrasting more bubblegum renderings
    by Jacques Lu Cont and the Emperor Machine.</p><p>
    Lu Cont basically foists a disco edit on us, with the nerve to toss in a ""Waiting for Tonight"" bassline and J-Lo oh-oh's.  Karin's ""flashlights and explosions"" line works surprisingly well as a bubbly, lithium-induced club credo, though an overall weak beat and disappointing build prematurely pull the plug on the party.  The Emperor Machine packs more goodies in his bag, burying Karin's wrenching lyrics under photon zaps and floating space disco debris.  A bit insensitive, perhaps, but she sounds cool with it, cooing over the song's swanky, palm-muted cool-down.</p><p>
    Vitalic rounds out the mix nicely, countering Lu Cont's fluffy pillow-talk gem with a bilious high-register drone.  While the track finds him flexing a little too muscle in wake of his own incredible debut album, it gives the EP a coked-up freakout edge and a rigid framework trapping Karin with the repeated phrase, ""I don't know what more to ask for/ I was given just one wish."" Together, the remixes make for one exciting version of the dating game, each hotshot DJ making their efforts to win Karin for themselves.  Final count: one stud, one cocksure dude, and three pretty boys.  Not too shabby, especially considering it's all for an above-average track on an average album.</p></div>"|6862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6862-what-else-is-there-ep/|7.6|Adam Moerder

The new direction caused throngs of longtime fans to turn their backs on the band, and the cash-in, resulting in a slick but sickly commercial hardcore sound, ultimately bombed.  Two years later, the band is back on Hydra Head, and while there are a few nods to the Cave In of days past, <em>Perfect Pitch Black</em> is nonetheless a melodic rock album at heart.</p><p>
    Strikingly, Perfect Pitch Black succeeds because of-- not in spite  
    of-- its catchy melodies, infectious riffing, and silk-smooth vocals.  
    The tempos, generally in the mid-to-slow range, give the songs time  
    to develop, allowing them to sink in gradually. Additionally, bassist  
    Caleb Scofield's guttural hardcore barking, once such a signature  
    element of Cave In's sound, only shows up here on occasion, as an  
    accent to Stephen Brodsky's clear, gliding vocal style that more  
    closely resembles the hard-rock singers of the 70s. Fresh off manning  
    the decks for the Red Chord and Victory at Sea, producer Andrew  
    Schneider lends these songs a heady atmosphere, ripe with booming  
    drums, glistening guitars, and twisted reverb effects.
    Following a brief intro, ""The World Is in Your Way"" rolls in on a  
    slow, jerky rhythm, but begins to hint at something more sinister as  
    the guitars shift into a slightly atonal style, and Scofield's  
    bestial holler breaks through-- a blend of melody and slow-burning  
    fury that sets the tone for much of the disc's runtime. ""Trepanning"",  
    however, applies a different formula, spinning a guitar-groove boogie  
    as Scofield snarls through the verses. The song leads into  
    ""Paranormal"", a seven-minute atmospheric piece which weaves elements of  
    psychedelia into the band's heavy riffage. Another surprising moment  
    comes with ""Ataraxia"", a math-metal instrumental that blends layers  
    of fuzzy, twisting guitars and distant, nebulous vocals.</p><p>
    Each of Cave In's albums to date has marked a distinct shift and change of approach, and <em>Perfect Pitch Black</em>'s strength lies with their ability to seamlessly intertwine their past and present, experimenting with a diverse array of progressive genres and styles while remaining true to their metalcore roots.  Granted, this is a far cry from the band's earlier work, and five years on from <i>Jupiter</i>, their creative apex does seem to have come and gone.  On the other hand, few bands are capable of weathering so much change while remaining so consistent.  Given the obstacles and challenges of their decade-long career, <i>Perfect Pitch Black</i> is a far more rewarding album than Cave In should rightly be capable of producing this late in the game.</p></div>"|1364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1364-perfect-pitch-black/|7.3|Cory D.

Another muttering, banging, squealing five-year-old live jazz album from Buffalo, NY, played by the pros, <i>Oasis of Whispers</i> is a September 2001 performance that finds Canadian multi-instrumentalist Glen Hall blowing through an assortment of saxes, flutes, and clarinets in collaboration with ""loft scene"" free-jazz OG William Hooker, and Lee Ranaldo, founding member of Sonic Youth and former guitar-tuner for Glenn Branca.  The hook, if it's there: A single moment, probably spontaneous, but fully formed.  And if not, then something so wild it briefly lunges out of the clattering background.</p><p>
    
    From the jazz end, Sonny Rollins' ""Blue Seven"" bop gets sauced up on loose Hooker drums, and flexes with Ranaldo guitar skronk, but hey, Rollins did it for 10 minutes at least, and these guys only make it for five-plus.  Tradition is unquestionably the back door of this stuff, so besides flashing cred, the results are best when the players slide off to the side: Check out the marathon ""Conference Call"", which weaves answering machine messages, Pauline Oliveros-like vocalizing, and beat poetry into a schizophrenic, saxophone-led charge into the subconscious.  The trio earns its keep here, wrestling drama from some truly mundane shit.  (""I'm checking the schedule""... ""we just pulled into Seattle""... ""a man lies on the beach."")</p><p>
    
    But the flipside applies, too.  Free jazz, as it's played on ""The Mechanism"", is three guys going to war with each other-- ""<i>my</i> sax,"" ""<i>my</i> fucking drum fill,"" ""fuck it, <i>I'm</i> shouting""-- and it flattens every dimension.  This was a live set: ""Mechanism"" was the warm up.  No way to feel the ghost but to try, but the id doesn't arrive until ""Eyemote"", expressed as insect sounds and mouthpiece muttering: ""It's not my fault I'm Catholic. I was born this way."" Now there's an idea.</p><p>
<i>Oasis of Whispers</i> might be all fighting in the trenches if not for its monster title track. The sex jam on an otherwise boy's club afternoon, ""Oasis of Whispers"" withholds, prolongs, and growls. Hall purrs; a kazoo sounds; Ranaldo does sub-audible mood electronics and delay; Hooker hits and backs off; they simultaneously give space and get right up in the face of the thing.  Restraint compels, and this track owns because they own every second.</p><p>
    
    Longing for the hard core is what haunts the rest of the record.  Getting worked up is hot for the players and hot for the played to, but rarely at the same time: When Hall/Ranaldo/Hooker hit the gas pedal, the backseat nods off; only when they get quiet do the kids wake up and notice.</p></div>"|4032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4032-oasis-of-whispers/|6.7|Zach Baron

For his latest addition to the series, however, Shipp has cleared the gallery to unveil his first solo piano album since 2002's <em>Songs-- an album of jazz standards-- and his first collection of original solo material in nearly a decade. As such, </em><em>One</em> simultaneously serves as both a meditative re-centering and as a further departure, with Shipp quietly redirecting his familiar post-Cecil Taylor vocabulary towards a singular form of numinous chamber music.</p><p>
    
    With their compact, elegant architecture and measured elocution, <em>One</em>'s 12 songs often resemble the early 20th century piano studies of Ravel or Debussy as closely as they do modern jazz. On recent albums like <em>Equilibrium</em> or <em>Harmony and Abyss, Shipp masked similar neo-classical touches beneath surface samples and programmed beats. But in this uncluttered format, Shipp has patiently afforded himself the space necessary to cultivate his sketches in full. On these tracks he plays with an expectant relish, an audible curiosity about where his compositions might next lead him. And while </em><em>One</em> will surely disappoint those who've come in hopes of fiery, atom-splitting improvisation, Shipp delivers these refined performances with such authority and sheer inquisitive force that his undisguised enthusiasm for this material can prove easily persuasive.</p><p>
    
    ""Arc"" opens the album with a full-bodied, ascendent sequence of chords that confidently pave the way for the splashy ""Patmos"", which cascades into a dazzling series of single-note runs that pop away like flashbulbs. ""Gamma Ray"" finds Shipp at his most devoutly Monk-like, chipping away at the song's turbulent rhythms until settling into a loopy, satisfying Jelly Roll Morton rumble. Conversely, on the brief ""A Rose Is a Rose"" or the sumptiously melodic ""Zero"", he plays with such a willowy, art-nouveau grace that he seems at points to abandon forward momentum altogether, content to luxuriate in his own sun-splashed idyll. </p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, Shipp's protracted sense of contentment can also work against him, as over the course of the album there are several instances when he lingers too long in his swirling, watercolored eddies. <em>One</em> is at its most effective when Shipp is at his most demanding, as on the dense tremors of ""Electro Magnetism"", where his furious, low-end tones threaten to shake the song loose from its floorboards. On such pieces Shipp creates an enthralling, unstable dynamic that he'll ideally build upon in his future work.</p></div>"|7121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7121-one/|7.3|Matthew Murphy

Did wonders when I got older and wasn't appalled by the Peru protruding below the waistline, but it didn't really give proper attention to the nape of her neck arching through Ghis' Montreal.

<p><i>Breakupdown, Ghis' proper album has no sweet nothings or sing-alongs: Frivolities have been ground to dust by Poirier's heavy fingers on what sounds to be three or four pads, at most, on his console.

If a synth or sample appears-- whether it be buzzing strings or a hollow flute-- it is percussive, adding more depth to the cavernous beats. It's great for anyone who's listened to those genres and wondered why nerds (like me) fret over samples or parse lyrics. That's not to say Poirier is joyless, only that he's a minimalist. Instead of interpreting different styles, he distills them to their common elements, bass and drums, and avoids glitching them into intelligent dance music. As smart as his music is, Poirier seems most concerned with neckboning his listeners, giving the coke-rap opponents something to rock in the whip. When he does allow room for a guest vocal, it's a Francophone (Omnikron, Seba), a Chicagoan toaster (DJ Collage of many a Klein record), London non-grime (Lotek Hi-Fi), or Beans, none of whom steal the show from young Ghis. </i></p>
<p>For those of us who rank major-label rap in our year-ends, Ghislain has remixed a handful of recent favorites on his self-released <i>Bounce le Remix (available for purchased download at <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.ghislainpoirier.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ghislainpoirier.com</a></span>).

Forget poetry, dude brought the laffs, from quasi-poetically stringing together the words ""mute nostril agony"" to regaling us with tales of ""Indians scattered on dawn's highway."" Priceless! Our ex-hippie gym teachers were right: The Doors frontman died way too young. Because, had the Shaman of Shtick made it through the 1970s, he might have realized his now-obvious comedic ambitions as fully as Richard Ashcroft, who used to catch Mojo Risin' comparisons back when his former band, the Verve, were actually psychedelic. Now, I slapped an 8.3 rating on a compilation of the Verve's singles as recently as 2004, and didn't hate Ashcroft's last two solo albums as much you all did, so my expectations were wide-open approaching <em>Keys to the World</em>, which the man self-hyped with Gallagher-brother aplomb as ""hot shit."" Riffing on John Lennon, he clearly meant ""flaming pile.""</p><p>
    
    See, Ashcroft's latest takes the over-seriousness of 2002's <em>Human Conditions</em>-- which he has personally likened to Marvin Gaye's best work-- and turns it still seriouser, into inimitable omg-wtf farce. Swept up in maudlin strings and chintzy brass, Ashcroft blurs his anguished syllables like Tom Petty doing Bob Dylan, embraces U2-jerkoff bombast, and follows his idiosyncratically generic muse into uncharted depths. <em>Keys to the World</em> is as hilariously indulgent as ""Trapped in the Closet"", if vastly less self-aware; it's also a more laughable
    satire of contemporary music than <em>Bang Bang Rock 'n' Roll</em>, though less durable and totally accidental.</p><p>
    
    Before <em>Keys to the World</em>, I never knew Coldplay's ""Fix You"" was subtle. Then I heard ""The Words Just Get in the Way"" (inevitably inferior to the similarly titled Gloria Estefan power ballad), on which, over colorless midtempo acoustic guitars, Ashcroft offers Chris Martin-like assistance: ""When your back's against the wall/ There's no one left to call/ Then call me."" And right on cue come the handclaps, the twangy guitar licks, dripping strings, and endless ""Hey Jude"" ad libs. ""Sing it to me now!"" Ashcroft instructs to a chanting chorus that, appropriately, consists only of himself.</p><p>
    
    Before <em>Keys to the World</em>, I never knew Bono was humble. The title track loops a C+C Music Factory-esque vocal sample amid canned MOR rhythms and melodramatic synths as Ashcroft jumps into a tragic, awkwardly worded tale: ""Institutions, you went through them, ah/ From the age of five/ And no one loves you, cared/ If you lived or you died."" But, like Africa's great white
    <em>Time</em> Person-of-the-Year hope with money-solves-everything ambitions, Ashcroft has another hubristic fix: ""Perhaps I could make it better."" How, Richard? ""I've got the keys to the world, yeah, aw/ Mixed-up world/ I've got the keys to the world, yeah."" For good measure, we also get an Everlast-style megaphone almost-rap. I promise.</p><p>
    
    Before <em>Keys to the World</em>, I never knew our world's problems could be presented so laughably by anyone not named Stephen Colbert. On fast-paced opener ""Why Not Nothing"", Ashcroft takes
    shots at the religious right (""the god squad""). But his slurred barbs soon fizzle into non-sequiturs: ""Who the fuck are you when you take that mask away?/ Friend, I don't know/ Oh, where do we go?"" Again Ashcroft has a keen suggestion for our betterment: ""Take my advice, don't let 'em treat you like a fool."" Then he emits porcine grunts for the last 30 seconds. On brightly adorned showstopper ""World Keeps Turning"", he mentions the U.S. president in suddenly apolitical fashion, and informs us of the Earth's movements with all the self-destructive solemnity of Copernicus: ""The world keeps turning/ Everybody's learning/ Keep your head up.""</p><p>
    
    Before <em>Keys to the World</em>, I agreed with the general consensus that music reviews should be relatively concise. But I still haven't told you about how ""Cry to the Morning"" reinterprets those three ominous ""All Along the Watchtower"" chords on music-box keyboard, how mechanically depressive single ""Break the Night With Colours"" bizarrely hints at Mr. Big's ""To Be With You"", or how the sprightly Cat Stevens folksiness that opens ""Why Do Lovers?"" transmogrifies into a fierce affirmation of a deity's existence, the stupefying one-liner, ""The demons I've got they are amazing,"" and the stupefyinger, ""Life is tough and life can be hard.""</p><p>
    
    On Jim Morrison's sprawling, nipple-eyed ""Celebration of the Lizard"", chronicled on the 1970 double-disc <em>Absolutely Live</em> album, he captured psychotropic absurdity Ashcroft hasn't matched in years. He does this on the neighbor-loving (""until his wife gets home"") title track from 1969's <em>The Soft Parade</em>, too. And also on the posthumous <em>An American Prayer</em> poetry disc, with impossibly kitschy blues-funk overdubbed by his surviving bandmates, money-grubbers even then.

I still remember the first few times I ever sat at a piano, holding it down and letting the notes vibrate against each other until they faded to imperceptibility.  And then doing it again.</p><p>
    
    Incredibly, the sound of felt hammers on metal strings can be used to express almost any emotion you could name.  In 1979, when he first recorded the piano loops used on <em>The Garden of Brokenness</em>, William Basinski says he was attempting capture ""mono no aware,"" a Japanese concept whose closest English translation is ""the sadness of things.""  ""Things"" could be taken two ways, of course-- it may refer to the general state of being alive, or to literal, physical objects.  Either way, these sad, slow piano loops are the kind of sounds that poke around in your guts looking for sensitive spots to nestle into.</p><p>
    
    The sound of <em>The Garden of Brokenness</em> should be familiar to anyone who's dipped into Basinski's well of recently reconstituted old tapes before-- it shares more than a passing affinity with <em>Variations: A Movement in Chrome Primitive, </em><em>A Red Score in Tile</em>, or December 2004's <em>Silent Night</em>, being drawn from the same well.  The record consists of one 50-minute pianoscape, really no more than a couple of chords wandering in their own reverb.  As the loop persists, Basinski mixes it with soft drones and the sounds of amplitude modulation.  The piece is punctuated by two lengthy passages of near-silence, where the sound that builds up over the preceding minutes is allowed to die away to nothing, clearing the air completely for the next build-up.</p><p>
    
    As beautiful as it is, there is a certain sense on <em>The Garden of Brokenness</em> that Basinski has been here before, and that his supply of old tapes may be running out.  He's proven his ability to work outside of his aging archives with his Watermusic series, and I suspect that his rewarding series of records built around these decaying sound sources may soon come to an end. Should that be the case, no worries: Basinski has injected more than his share of beauty into the world through these recordings.</p></div>"|580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/580-the-garden-of-brokenness/|7.5|Joe Tangari

So I was pleased to discover the work of Mark O'Leary, a guitarist based in Cork, Ireland-- and was even more surprised to learn he'd worked with so many big names of improv here and abroad, from touring in Paul Bley's group, to collaborating with downtown New Yorkers like Joey Baron and Matthew Shipp.</p><p>
     
    O'Leary plays with a clean, unpretentious tone, spinning inventive solos that he can ratchet up to breathless speeds with no sign of showiness. He echoes the rigorously unadorned style of Joe Morris, and his technique of switching (sometimes mid-piece) between a distorted tone and a gentle, sustained one resembles Bill Frisell's style without cloning it. But as a rule, O'Leary shies away from easy imitations: You can guess who he's listened to, but his style is his own.</p><p>
     
    Just last year, O'Leary released four strong albums on Leo. Each one puts him in a trio with a risky, adventurous sideman, a drummer or a pianist for the rhythm section, and no bassist-- a gap that leaves each band challengingly unanchored. I recommend the pensive <em>Chamber Trio</em> album with Matthew Shipp and Mat Maneri, or his latest record with Uri Caine and Ben Perowsky, <em>Closure</em>, a rambunctious date where O'Leary pushes his knuckles as fast as they can bend in a John McLaughlin-like wrestling match with his fretboard. But the best place to start would be <em>Levitation</em>, a session from five years ago with distinguished Polish trumpeter Tomasz Stanko and veteran jazz and fusion drummer Billy Hart.</p><p>
     
    Throughout this one-day session you can hear the chemistry develop between Stanko and O'Leary: Both men are serious and measured, but also curious. The mostly languorous tempos make them pace like animals checking out their turf, while Hart-- ducking away from a time-keeping role-- keeps the ground shifting and shaking beneath them. This is the kind of slow but taut improvisation that few people do well, and it's almost always engrossing. And when they heat up, they can knock the wind out of you-- especially on the 16-minute title cut, where O'Leary gradually turns up the distortion as he and Stanko trade one feverish solo after another. This is patient music, but it sure knows how to pounce.</p></div>"|6121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6121-levitation/|7.7|Chris Dahlen

Surely Pollard's decision to retire the name was more than mere paperwork; after all, for at least the past decade, Pollard and GBV were practically synonymous.  What message, then, was Bob trying to send with this continuity reset: a signal of impending stylistic change, a shift away from hand-me-down rock theatrics towards intimate introspection?  Or perhaps just fatigue with having his new work constantly measured against the GBV yardstick?</p><p>
    
    Whatever the reason, the retired Pollard is barely distinguishable from the pathologically prolific mic-swinging frontman we know and love-- at least in terms of work ethic.  Having spent 2005 in what must have been an extremely painful ""hiatus"" (in Pollard terms, defined as only two EPs and a couple of side projects), the first month of 2006 brings the official release of his long-since-finished double-disc opus <i>From a Compound Eye</i>, declaring the club officially re-opened.  While the album is hardly Pollard's first Christian-name release-- Fading Captain
    subscribers know of at least nine others-- most of his previous solo projects seemed to be little more than songbook dumps for completists.</p><p>
    
    Packed with 26 stylistically and lyrically sprawling songs, it's difficult to excavate any simple proclamations from <i>FaCE</i>'s considerable girth.  The record's fidelity falls into the mid-fi range of early and late GBV: clean and balanced one minute, needle-in-the-red the next.  Some tracks retain the hit-and-run unfinished snippet form of the band's peak; others stretch out past the rarely-reached five-minute barrier.  Thematically, <i>From a Compound Eye</i> is an even more frustrating tangle, spirituality rubbing shoulders with boozy hedonism, ruminations on middle-age interrupted by youthful boasting, and self-examination pitted against extra-terrestrial fantasies.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps it's always been this way; like many of his mid-90s indie hall-of-fame peers, Pollard has often obfuscated his inner thoughts with non-sequiturs and abstract language.  Casting off his bandname and fast approaching his 50th birthday hasn't changed Pollard's approach on this point, though the tone of <em>FaCE exudes a general sense of melancholy he's previously kept mostly hidden, such as when he diluted the divorce laments of </em><em>Isolation Drills</em> in arena-rock trappings.  Even the moments of perfect pop one comes to expect from a Pollard album contain unavoidable tinges of sadness: Armchair-psychoanalyze the age difference inherent in ""Dancing Girls and Dancing Men"", or the creepy old man sex-boast ""I'm a Widow"".  (Chorus: ""I'm
    a widow and I'm hot to do you."")</p><p>
    
    All this soul-searching-- buried, accidental, or otherwise-- is a welcome respite from the increasingly cartoonish persona Pollard had come to inhabit; I welcomed the end of GBV's run not only for the sake of Bob's liver, but for the sake of his psyche, forced to deal with living up to his super-lush image at every performance.  So while any musical evolution is nil, save
    maybe a marginally increased keyboard presence, <em>FaCE</em> still remains the most fascinating Bob-project in years, his approach thankfully free of desires for the radio acceptance and/or underground re-acceptance that have marred recent work.  Cumbersome as it may be, <em>From a Compound Eye</em> launches a new journey for indie-rock's pre-eminent song-dispenser, an early
    indication that Pollard has directed his prolific flow inward.</p></div>"|6386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6386-from-a-compound-eye/|7.1|Rob Mitchum

Last year, an early, incompleted version of his new album fell into the nefarious clutches of internet file-traders, effectively KILLING MUSIC.  Undaunted, the nonjudgmental 28-year-old father of two soldiered ahead to finish work on these stark, essentially acoustic songs, adding a couple of new ones and jettisoning others, while erstwhile Pedro the Lion multi-instrumentalist Casey Foubert provided understated production.  Now seeing official release on Barsuk, the completed <em>Makers</em> strains against time's passage, as rural Texas native Votolato alternately whispers and rasps stories about boxcars, train tracks, mining towns, dirt roads, and ""Frisco,"" accompanied by little more than a dusty harmonica.  Unfortunately, bare-bones arrangements, train songs, and good intentions are no shortcut to supposed authenticity, and still less are they a guarantor of overall quality.</p><p>
    
    The rootsy route isn't new to Votolato, whose former band Waxwing traversed wider pastures than their emo peers (even if I used to confuse them with Knapsack).  2003's Chris Walla-produced <em>Suicide Medicine</em> had more rocking moments, but Votolato's first solo songs, like 2001's ""Crabtree and Evelyn"", already foretold his current unplugged direction-- even if they were more Dashboard Confessional than railroad hymn.  Still, innumerable nostalgists have hammered this spike in recent years, from the likes of Iron &amp; Wine, Josh Ritter, and Kings of Convenience to Hayden, Damien Jurado, and Damien Rice-- not to mention the entire alt-country movement.  Given the competition, mere earnestness isn't enough.</p><p>
    
    With his fingerpicking low and percussion scarce, Votolato cedes the spotlight to his songwriting.  However, a penchant for copywriter wordplay stacks <em>Makers</em> with a freight train full of awkwardness. ""The bones inside your mind were all broken"" sits
    clumsily atop the title track's steel guitar, while Votolato's
    narrator is ""a punchline who's punchdrunk"" on catchier,
    harmonica-soaked ""Portland Is Leaving"", in ""the kind of comedy where
    no one's laughing, because it's hard to."" Um, in this case it doesn't
    take a lot to laugh. A deft metaphor comparing clouds to ""stilts or
    crutches, I don't know which one"" on ""The Night's Disguise"" and death
    cleverly claiming ""anything that life didn't already take"" on ""Wait
    Out the Days"" can't reestablish Votolato's troubadour credentials
    after a few too many such doozies.</p><p>
    
    Another trouble is that Votolato's songs sometimes sound less like
    their presumed rustic inspirations than the middle-of-the-road 1990s
    bands they influenced. To be sure, ""She Was Only in It for the Rain""
    (moronically credited to ""Piss Pissedoffherson"" but notable for its
    ghostly Southern gothic verses), non-leaked addition ""White Daisy
    Passing"", and especially placid pastoral ""The Uppers Aren't Necessary
    Anymore"" reek of Sam Beamish hush and Garfunkadelic harmonies. Cool,
    the intricate guitar coda of ""Streetlights"" alights near ""Blackbird"".
    But frankly, Votolato's clear, all-American vocals amid the
    acoustic-pop backdrop of ""Goldfield"" brings to mind fellow Texans and
    one-time college-circuit idols Jackopierce; the way he intermittently
    goes hoarse for emphasis reminds me of another Southwestern band with
    that tendency, and by the time the maudlin ""I'm really leaving""
    conclusion kicks in I'm wishing the track sounded <em>more</em> like the
    Gin Blossoms (don't hate).</p><p>
    
    Oh yeah, SPOILER ALERT, the closing song reveals that the title of
    <em>Makers</em> refers to the whiskey. A
    deeper, more philosophical meaning is doubtless implied secondarily,
    but then again Votolato does ask us to pass him a ""bottle"" of the
    stuff. Either way it would require some stiff swigs indeed to deny
    that musical Ludditism is sometimes just atavism, and that a
    super-slo-mo HDTV close-up, far from being an end in itself, only ends
    up benefiting those with the fewest warts. ""Sounds too simple, but
    love is the only answer,"" Votolato insists. Fair enough, but I bought
    that record already-- what part of another simple maxim, ""make it
    new,"" don't you understand?</p></div>"|8545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8545-makers/|4.2|Marc Hogan

Throughout their work Excepter have shown a decided preference for the glancing blow, addressing their musical subjects from the most indirect angles possible, and rarely striking from the same direction twice. On the band's latest, the five-song EP <em>Sunbomber</em>, they demonstrate their most overt minimalist pop gestures yet. But in typical Excepter fashion, these tracks often seem less full-fledged songs than simply the bones and shadow of song, remnants left behind by their authors' cryptic scavenging.</p><p>
<em>Sunbomber</em> is the first record by Excepter in their current incarnation as a quartet, with versatile noisemaker Jon Nicholson added to the fold. Gone are husband and wife duo Calder Martin and Caitlin Cook, and with them many of the more dilated, impenetrable fusions of 2004's <em>KA</em> or last year's <em>Throne</em>. This EP was reportedly recorded in one hour during the quartet's first performance together, and these slack, disorderly tracks make it easy to take such claims at face value. Although similar in construction to portions of their recent <em>Self Destruction</em>, here at least Excepter haven't the cheek to identify <em>Sunbomber</em> as house music. Scaffolded with fragile programmed beats and numberless blips and plinks, on <em>Sunbomber</em> the group use their spectral electronics to ferret out stubborn avant-pop melodies that aren't fully accustomed to this manner of rough treatment.</p><p>
    
    On opener ""One More Try"", ripples of synth and winds supply the birdcalls for Excepter's lo-fi, sun-stroked approximation of Martin Denny's exotica, before John Fell Ryan's unintelligible vocals stumble in like a derelict beachcomber and upset the tiki torches. Further garbled instructions are delivered on ""Bridge Traffic"", a track that combines twerpy atomized funk and jittery Eyewitness News keyboards to surprisingly attractive effect. The following ""Dawn Patrol"" maintains the set's steadiest rhythm-- laced through with a potent, whistling melody-- before opening into an impressive thicket of static and low-resolution drumbeats.</p><p>
    
    Despite its melodic flourishes, however, in many respects <em>Sunbomber</em> stands as Excepter's noisiest outing to date. The supple, reverberant figures of past triumphs like ""Vacation"" have here been replaced by textures considerably more ragged and jarring, particularly on the set closing mini-epic ""The Sun Bomber"". On this track and elsewhere, the listener might wish that more attention had been paid to the drum programming, as their limpid beats too often feel flabby and perfunctory. (Who knows, maybe they could spend two hours recording next time.) Yet as ""The Sun Bomber"" is quietly chewed to gristle between Excepter's slow-grinding jaws, one can't help but marvel at the group's inability to create commonplace music, and be drawn again into their well-camouflaged snares.</p></div>"|2915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2915-sunbomber-ep/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

On a different label (say Eclipse, or Important), the whale might have made it big: Underwater anyway, humpbacks run a huge sound game. Like some above sea level, humpbacks perform by circling for hours around groups of repetitive phrases sung together, incorporating individual whale improvs as they arise; from gradual changes, they evolve new songs. On land, or without a sonograph, background noise is more prosaic: Screaming florescent lights, gurgling computers, ambient traffic noise, wind, floorboard creaks. What's heard, vs. what's <i>meant</i> to be heard, well, who knows, but for sound as Sound, Burning Star Core's gurgle is positively baleen.</p><p>
    
    C. Spencer Yeh's Burning Star Core has been around in one form or another since 1993, though <i>The Very Heart of the World</i> is only their second widely available release, after 2002's <i>Brighter Summer Day</i>. This album finds Yeh joined by Midwestern noise notables Robert Beatty, Mike Connelly, and Trevor Tremaine of Hair Police (Connelly now performs with Wolf Eyes as well); the full cast of KY's Eyes and Arms of Smoke; and others, among them players from Noumena and Apples in Stereo, taking turns on percussion, ""presence,"" electronics, guitar, and strings. Yeh's Drone Disco imprint is also alive and well, as is his impossibly prolific solo and collab career: A duo with Magik Markers' Pete Nolan late last year, a trio with John Olson and Jessica Rylan, BxC splits with Comets on Fire, plus infinite stacks of CD-Rs and tapes. Yeh's dictum, like Mark E. Smith's: If he's in the building, it's a Burning Star Core gig, cassette release, limited-edition silkscreened print, and, probably, forgotten the next day.</p><p> 
     
    Though Yeh runs with the circuit breakers and benders, he rolls chronic and sheet music with the same ease: Tony Conrad's the obvious touchstone, and Yeh can play, but he also doesn't mind mucking up the works with the wet noise, gibberish talk, and free percussion that gives <i>The Very Heart of the World</i> its elevation-of-everyday-life punch. ""Benjamin"" layers late night, outside-the-bedroom-window ambient music-- a car-crash violin drone toys with a cricket chirp, while branches tap glass. ""Catapults"" marches over windy keys and wake-up snares for zone-outs leisurely and eerie. Tremaine's hits move Yeh's violin drone past minimalism to a less formal, cluttered quiet.</p><p> 
     
    While most BxC subliminals work up low-key disruptions into aural legibility, Yeh &amp; co. are more than capable of lowering the brow. ""Come Back Through Me"" rediscovers an inclination toward hitting big, tapping sticks, loosing guitar chords, and violining lines in and out of phase. This is their most whale song of whale songs: One short phrase worked over through time, built big and long-range with key improvs, string scrapes, and a low-grade electronic wash. The frenzy's nice, but it begs another record flip. Back to the beginning.</p></div>"|1195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1195-the-very-heart-of-the-world/|7.0|Zach Baron

But for a band that trades in that kind of ambiguity with no easy emotional answers, their balancing act is on a much higher wire-- the more melodrama they mine from their unique brand of restraint, the further they get from any kind of release.</p><p>
<em>Albatross</em> starts strong: ""Red Drop"" has a confident guitar strum and unpredictable breakdowns, and ""Closed Drum"" is a spirited Pinback nick with swinging acoustic arpeggios and simmering electric guitars creating white noise just below its surface. Unfortunately, the lengthy center of this record is a brick of brooding, mid-tempo dullness. The formula may not have changed much between records, but <em>Albatross</em> at its best suffers from an atmosphere so stale it chokes the songs, and at worse sounds like the soundtrack to <em>Rain Man</em>, given the booming percussion and hanging organ tones on songs like ""Play the Part"" and ""Not Asleep"".</p><p>
    
    The Standard never get cartoonishly morose, but their plundering of the same gray middle ground becomes exhausting from a lack dynamics or pacing. The moments of brightness are fleeting, like the notes of Jay Clarke's piano in ""Not Asleep"" that flutter above the ponderousness of the track like a feather on a gust of wind. Other breaths of fresh air come late in the record: The factory-line pounding of the penultimate track ""In Waves"" provides a much-needed shot in the arm, and the bubbling organ in the intro ""Little Green"" neatly incorporates post-rock sounds and textures, but it stumbles into a wall of guitars that's more like a knee-high ledge and a coda that strains to reach poignancy. ""You Will"" is less dynamic, but Putnam's calm monotone shows an ease and confidence that brings a sigh of relief, though no less weary than the rest of the album. You'd think that for keeping the mood so static and the focus so narrow, more of the songs on <em>Albatross</em> would hit their mark.</p></div>"|7459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7459-albatross/|5.8|Jason Crock

And honestly you wouldn't have been missing very much. <em>Omnibus</em>, Tarkio's two-disk catch-all wrap-up from Kill Rock Stars (now the Decemberists' former home), is full of the kind of well-meaning, basically bland acoustic rock that all college towns seem to produce in bulk. In fact, the music is so rooted in a very particular strain of college rock that it could conceivably have been recorded ten years earlier with ambitions to sit on student playlists alongside Guadalcanal Diary, the Ocean Blue, and <em>Bread and Circus</em>-era Toad the Wet Sprocket.</p><p>
    
    Tarkio formed in Missoula, Montana, in 1996, after Meloy returned from a few semesters at the University of Oregon with a mind to change his major to English. Once settled, he recruited banjo player Gibson Hartwell, bassist Louis Stein, and drummer Brian Collins, and the band took its name from a nearby ghost town. Over just a few years, Tarkio recorded a few EPs-- most self-released, but one via Barcelona Records-- all of which are collected on <em>Omnibus</em>, along with a few previously unreleased tracks. Predictably, there's a lot of institutional guitar jangle in every song, along with some polite strumming, decent drumming, and Meloy's studious wordplay and lit-class allusions to Camus and <em>The Sheltering Sky</em>.</p><p>
    
    Then as now, Meloy stands out. His now-familiar vocals and brainy lyrics elevate the group above the mass of uncelebrated college bands past and present, even if he sounds like an impressionable student just out of a stimulating lit class. There are intimations of the scamp he would become with the Decemberists; <em>Omnibus</em> even contains an early, less animated version of ""My Mother Was a Chinese Trapeze Artist"" from the latter band's <em>5 Songs</em> EP. But this is definitely Meloy in his formative years, before all the sea shanties and chimbley sweeps and military homoeroticism, when he was just getting control of his humor and intelligence. In the liner notes, he dismisses these songs with a half-interested ""feh,"" preferring to think of them as a soundtrack to memories of camaraderie and teeth cutting. </p><p>
    
    Meloy's greatest flaw was his apparent inability to self-edit. The 27 songs on <em>Omnibus are uniformly overlong, most approaching or surpassing the five-minute mark when barely a handful have cause to exceed three minutes. You have to wash the dishes and put on your pajamas before these songs take the hint. This may seem like a minor gripe, but it seriously compromises the individual and cumulative effect of these songs. ""Caroline Avenue"", for instance, has a catchy chorus saddled to Hartwell's galloping as well as some of the band's cleverest lyrics (although I don't believe Meloy when he claims he's ""chasing shots of whiskey with everclear""), but drawn out to nearly six minutes, these elements lose their power and ultimately test your patience. Hartwell even admits as much in the liner notes that ""on some level maybe what works about these recordings is not what they are but, what they could have been."" They could have been shorter. </em></p><p>
    
    Some songs, mostly from the 1998 release <i>I Guess I Was Hoping for Something More, hint strongly at what the band could have become with a few more years to refine their chops. ""Helena Won't Get Stoned"" is a buoyant sing-along that must have been a blast at their live shows (especially in, ahem, Helena), but ""Candle"" was probably the closer, with its ambitious and dour guitar coda. ""Your Own Kind"" is a tongue-in-cheek, yet suspiciously persuasive, approximation of easy listening, and ""Standing Still"" cribs shamelessly but fairly successfully from R.E.M. </i></p><p>
<em>Omnibus isn't arranged chronologically, which is a big check in the minus column. Presenting these tracks out of order severely skews the true story of the band, which seems like it should be a priority for such an artifact. This decision also means the second disc is weighed down with molasses-slow demos and live tracks like ""Tristan and Isolde"", which bears comparison to Dire Straits' much more piquant ""Romeo and Juliet"". The disc continues its dirge-like pace with tracks like ""Never Will Marry"" and ""Following Camden Down"", which seem to be sequenced to stop any momentum dead. </em></p><p>
    
    On the other hand, these songs weren't recorded for this type of release, and bands like Tarkio aren't mean for widespread scrutiny. There's a reason every college town has their own acoustic rock group: They don't export well. Their appeal is entirely local-- not so much the music itself, which is easily reproducible, but the unique thrill of seeing people you know or could know up there on stage playing music. I'm not knocking it. For many budding musicians, writers, lovers, fans, and students, that connection can be just as inspiring as any motivational speaker or activist theatre troupe. As such, Tarkio fulfilled a specifically local function, and if you weren't enrolled at the University of Montana seven or eight years ago, listening to <em>Omnibus</em> may be disappointing, perhaps even a little intrusive. You may not get it, but it wasn't meant for you. </p></div>"|8312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8312-omnibus/|5.7|Stephen M. Deusner

Frequently gorgeous but over-lubed, the album forges soundscapes so lush they're almost narcotic.</p><p>
    
    In a British rock scene suddenly governed by sexually frustrated Sheffield kids with a Lavigne-shallow understanding of the anvils on which they stand, <i>Amber's yawns are a nice respite from the geeky frissons now being purveyed. The Hove foursome (bummer no Carters among them) come off mellow and sure-footed, maybe a little paternal. The band remembers life before Oasis, even before industrialization: <em>Amber</em>'s best songs imagine atavistic, Tolkien-esque habitats, happily ignorant of history's looming smogsets. Even the title invites eco-friendly readings.</i></p><p>
    
    You'd expect any album with such profligate nods to nature, and how cool it is, and how the modern world is scary, of packing an ideological strain. But frontman Jason Pegg spouts lover's vitriol as diligently as he casts granola melancholy. Risking sounding like a crybaby on Christmas, ""I Hate It That I Got What I Wanted"" details a strange affliction: remorse over getting what one wants. Pegg's reasoning? ""I don't want it anymore."" Fair 'nuff. Yet the words don't bother so much as the way they're delivered, Pegg essaying uptempo snarl, getting smothered by those ""whoa, dude, let it ring!"" Road Rash guitars. Better is the topsy-turvy ""It's Getting Light Outside"", whose pistoning, tympani-heavy rhythm provides a good context for Pegg's nasally, overearnest sing-song. ""You Can't Have Me"", even softer-hued, plays fuzzy gegenschein to the more importunate yowlers; the Fennesz-wet upbeat guitar pulses can't <em>not</em> encourage nostalgic reverie.</p><p> 
    
    Another way <em>Amber</em> foils expectations: For a band with such imaginative whimsy, Clearlake have a disappointingly staid invasion jones. ""Finally Free"" does its scuzziest nth-wave stomp, complete with tactical tambourine jiggles, aloof vox harmonies, and an insultingly simple guitar lick; cowbell's a continental aberration, probably a Pixies reference. Even worse is single ""Neon"", whose booming drum-and-harmonica rig wants to be Big &amp; Rich, not fey British indie rockers. The album really shines when it's at its quietest, like when Pegg quavers trying to bridge the wide gap between ""Dreamt That You Died""'s baggy guitar chords. Never mind the song recycles <em>Cedars</em> standout ""Trees in the City"", only this time on some macabre quasi-personal folderol, not the original's unambiguous anti-concrete screed. Plugged-in but still drowsy, ""It's Getting Light Outside"" is the real gem, though, mainly because it understands that volume does not equate to energy in recorded music: post-chorus guitar spikes provide a twist-of-lime kick without rising above library volume. A word to British rock in '06: The frissons are great, but let's have more yawns.</p></div>"|1496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1496-amber/|7.4|Sam Ubl

The five songs on D.C.-based Meredith Bragg and the Terminals' <em>Departures EP</em> all recount romantic break-ups and partings, but Bragg is much less concerned with messy heartbreak and recrimination than with holding off the inevitable departure and the daunting logistics of finally moving on-- what to do, where to go, and how to get there. On ""Empty Beds"", the EP's lead track, he asks, ""What will I do for Christmas?"" as a means of evoking the banal complications of a broken relationship. ""Postcard From Boston"" presumably picks up some time later, as Bragg tries to make peace with an ex over the phone. He's not shooting for immediate emotional impact on any of these songs, but for a particular resonance that will build with each listen. This musical and emotional pragmatism keeps Bragg from sounding whiny, maudlin, or precious-- although he occasionally veers close to all three. He tends to be a little self-absorbed, but such is the province of every white guy with an acoustic guitar.</p><p>
    
    Bragg's songwriting has grown more acute since his debut, but more impressive is the development of his sound. His transparent emulation of Elliott Smith and Ben Gibbard on the group's 2005 debut, <em>Volume 1</em>, gave that album the feel of a rehearsal, and on <em>Departures</em>, which was recorded at famed Inner Ear Studios, that influence is definitely present. But Bragg relies on it much less, having apparently absorbed it and others into a more individual approach. As a result, <em>Departures</em> is a stronger, more assured statement, one that sounds much less imitative or tentative.</p><p>
    
    Bragg's vocals, guitar playing, and songwriting remain squarely at the forefront, but the Terminals tease out the songs' moods expertly, creating and sustaining the EP's darkly intimate atmosphere. Elizabeth Olson's cello and Brian Minter's keyboards add gravity to the songs, and the two occasionally break out of their sideman roles: Olson slices her way through ""Let's Start Over"", neatly undercutting Bragg's softly assured melody with a more aggressive, almost percussive rhythm. And Jonathan Roth's perfectly mic'd drums drive ""Talk Me Down"" and ""Postcard from Boston"", allowing the songs to change form and tone mercurially. </p><p>
<em>Departures</em> ends with a cover of Songs:Ohia's ""Two Blue Lights"". It's not a very adventurous interpretation-- it doesn't take much to make a Jason Molina tune sound murky and mournful-- but it's still a fitting choice to end the EP, nicely echoing the theme of Bragg's songs while slyly realigning his stylistic roots, making <em>Departures</em> a bit of a departure itself. </p></div>"|1168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1168-the-departures-ep/|7.6|Stephen M.

    in the sense of ""soft rock"" or ""the quiet is the new loud""; carving
    her own niche of idyllic bedroom psychedelia, Samara Lubelski's newest
    takes pop orchestrations to levels of insulation previously
    unimagined-- it's as though she recorded her murmured symphony inside a
    down pillow and comforter.</p><p>
    
    Unlike de rigueur solo folkies, Lubelski isn't afraid to surround
    herself with an airy ""teenage symphony to god"" army. According to the
    liner notes, there are 15 participants here, not including the
    multi-instrumental, knob-turning Lubelski. Donning headphones, it's
    fascinating to try charting the ingenious ways she tucks and repositions
    the players into such a precise sound. The album was 
    recorded between Germany and Brooklyn with a cast that includes some
    of her ex-Tower Recordings chums: P.G. Six on baroque flute and 12-string and Tim Barnes on drums/percussion. Among the other guests are Matt Heyner
    of No Neck Blues Band on upright bass and Espers' cellist Helena Espvall. Of course, Lubelski comes armed with everything
    from guitar and violin to poppi shakers, mellotron, and her lovely
    voice.</p><p>
    
    For those who don't recognize Samara's name-- well, shame on you.
    Actually, no, she's such an understated, ethereal figure (think 4AD
    taken down a notch) that her relative anonymity makes sense. Still,
    she's been doing great things for a long time, whether fronting the
    trio Hall of Fame, playing internationally with Metabolismus, or
    working as an engineer at Brooklyn's Rare Book Room where she recorded
    the Fiery Furnaces and Magik Markers, among others. Her history with
    Tower Recordings was mentioned above, and she's also collaborated with
    everyone from Tara Jane O'Neil and White Magic to Jackie-O
    Motherfucker and Tony Conrad.</p><p>
    
    Lubelski's 2004 solo album, <em>The Fleeting Skies</em>, was a
    favorite of mine when it was released. It's unfortunate to report that besides
    Spectacular of Passage's opener, ""Lick 'n Leap"", its neighbor ""Sister
    Silver"", and ""Broken Links"", this collection doesn't
    provide the same Technicolor chills and crushed velvet hooks as its
    predecessor.</p><p>
    
    Judging from its luster, <em>The Fleeting Skies</em> aligned itself more with
    sunrises, whereas <em>Spectacular</em>
    evokes a powdered duskiness. There's plenty of beauty, but last time
    around the hooks were sharper, more defined. There's less temptation
    to sing along now; but then, perhaps these are mumbled good nights.
    (Images are often kinda blurred when you turn out the lights.) The
    gorgeous ""Orion""'s syrupy whispers could very well be an eventide
    offering to the constellation that gave it a name-- but eventually Mr.
    Sandman hits you upside the head with his goods.</p><p>
    
    Don't misunderstand sleepiness as boredom. <em>Spectacular of Passages</em> can
    be a rich experience, and there are a number of strong moments. The album's so tight it has a tendency to close in on itself,
    but when you <em>do</em> duck your head inside there are plenty of, well, spectacular passages. Let me equivocate a
    bit more: I'd be curious to see what'd happen if Lubelski's
    magisterial sonic precision was taken for a more
    arresting ride-- more cracked, splintered, or rusted-- because what we have now is a beautiful, precious
    music box or curio that you won't be compelled to open that often.</p></div>"|4999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4999-spectacular-of-passages/|6.5|Brandon Stosuy

    artist. That he's not unabashedly L.A. and doesn't get off on tickling our FM culture pleasure areas. That he doesn't deliberately sculpt his Brian
    Wilson/California weirdo-songwriter mythology to a T. That he doesn't pretend he invented genre-bending lo-fi. Got all that? Good, here's the kicker-- <em>House Arrest</em> is just another slightly above average album from Pink; controversy and fanfare be damned.</p><p>
    
    It's a shame there's so much baggage with Pink's albums, but he hasn't exactly shied away from self-aware self-promotion. Opener ""Hardcore Pops Are Fun"" contains the line ""Pop music is good/ It sounds like it should/ Pop music is mine/ It tastes so divine."" Next song has Pink ""getting interesting results"" whenever he ""thinks of a band"" and ""sits down and tries,"" further pondering in the second verse whether he'll write a good song today. The track ends with a half-assed attempt at self-deprecation (""I'm not going to try anymore""), but further reinforces the fundamental beef surrounding Pink-- the dude tries too hard to be pop's puppet master, possessing the last 50 years of tuneful feel-goodness at his fingertips.</p><p>
    
    I never thought I'd be saying this in an age of Coldplay and reality TV
    melodrama, but Pink's slapdash compositions could actually use some sentimentality, or at least gravitas, amidst the rapid-fire nostalgia. Some say Pink's expansiveness-for-emotiveness tradeoff works, but it feels like hors d'oeuvres in place of a scrumptious dessert. No doubt about it, Pink demonstrates a knack for hooks, however, and <em>House Arrest</em> comes as close to bare bones pop rock as Pink gets.</p><p>
    
    So many of these tracks start strong, flashing GBV or Olivia Tremor
    Control-sized melodies only to botch them with three-plus minutes of
    ""experimental"" noise fodder. For 90 seconds ""The People I'm Not"" is the
    catchiest, tightest fake Elvis Costello track I'v heard, but it quickly
    disintegrates into a boring bridge and three-minute outro sounding nothing like the song's beginning. Despite its hokey meta, ""Interesting Results"" taps one of Robert Pollard's sing-along choruses and bite-sized AOR-via-8-track swagger.</p><p>
    
    Pink's bankrupt Beck act ultimately bleeds through the majority of <em>House
    Arrest </em>; his poor use of samples and rhythm sections make for one very unfunky white boy. Two kooky breakdowns bookend ""Almost Waiting"", but the soulless Bee Gees imitation in the middle unjustly separates them. The title track cracks up over its own joke, playing an answering machine message chastising Pink for failing to pay parking tickets before launching into a highly ADHD-affected mishmash. Unable to congeal for 10 coherent seconds, the track sheds new light on the Ariel Pink debate: It's not that he's too pretentious with his work, he's obviously too insecure to show his songwriting at face value.</p></div>"|6555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6555-house-arrest/|6.2|Adam Moerder

Oldham's latest effort, a collaboration with Chicago stalwarts Tortoise, is an equally unflinching testament to his shape-shifting jones: <em>The Brave and the Bold</em> collects covers of disparate artists, including Devo, Elton John, Richard Thompson, the Minutemen, Melanie, Bruce Springsteen, Lungfish, Don Williams, Milton Nascimento, and Quix*o*tic, howled by Oldham while Tortoise churns incessantly in the background.</p><p>
    
    Tortoise's long-acclaimed math-rock stylings remain intact throughout, and Oldham's voice is still all elbows and knees, dry and rangy, but <em>The Brave and the Bold</em> isn't necessarily predictable. Both artists maintain their signature sounds here, yet the pairing yields few particularly fiery or compelling results. Instead, classic songs are rearranged and reconsidered, stripped down and rebuilt-- theoretically, the results should be intriguing, but instead, <em>The Brave and the Bold</em> is mostly mediocre, benefiting from neither Oldham's expert songwriting nor Tortoise's experimental clash.</p><p>
<em>The Brave and the Bold</em>'s version of ""Thunder Road"" is crushing and ominous, unapologetically divorced from Springsteen's fist-pumping highway anthem, and less a call to action than a proclamation of defeat, broken and sad, punctuated by plodding guitar and weird hisses. No matter how hard the band tries to distill its essence, the awesome, screaming glory of ""Thunder Road"" can't be culled from languished pronouncements like, ""Well I got this guitar/ And I learned how to make it talk."" All that charm is buried deep in Springsteen's undeniable, gorgeously adolescent cockiness, the promise of escape, the momentum of flight, the big moment, two minutes in, where the drums kick up and the backing vocals swell and Springsteen hollers ""Roll down the window!"" Rip that away, and ""Thunder Road"" becomes limp and awkward.</p><p>
    
    The weird, feel-good thumps and scale-crawling of Devo's ""That's Pep"" are translated into fart-feedback and sped-up honks, with Oldham's vocals periodically seeped in thick, uncomfortable echo (although there's still something excellent about the way Oldham yells ""pep!,"" presumably with his eyebrows raised and hands in the air). Lungfish's menacing ""Love Is Love"" keeps much of its original shape, while the dancefloor smarm of Elton John's ""Daniel"" is traded-in for trademark Tortoise twitters, with Oldham's voice layered in effects and near-indecipherable; although Oldham's pipes could be a little less heavily treated (all that fuzz obscures classic Oldham nuance), ""Daniel"" is still the album's most successful rendition, somehow retaining all the grinning heart of the original, and giving Oldham a chance to dust-off his crazy falsetto. </p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <em>The Brave and the Bold</em> is a collection of not-particularly-compelling cover songs, rolled out by two of contemporary indie's most uncompromising and rewarding forces. Or, in short: We all really wish this was better-- less tiring, less dour, less sluggish-- than it actually is.</p></div>"|705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/705-the-brave-and-the-bold/|5.4|Amanda Petrusich

Writers on classic rock tend to possess an abundance of trivia that can fill up word counts, and if these detailed minutiae often seem to convey more about the writer than about the music in question, due diligence can find fertile analytical territory in historical context and cultural memory. But if Cream and their ilk were a resonant moment, then modern facsimiles of same-- power trio Pearls and Brass, for instance-- are memories of resonance rather than resonance itself. But let's not talk about postmodernism for once.</p><p> 
    
    So we're left to name-check the appropriate touchstones and to devise new ways of describing the same thing-- power, weight, speed. ""No Stone"" crackles with thunderous tattoos of percussion, lacquered bolts of guitar that ladder vertiginously, and mannish blues-rock emoting. ""Black Rock Man"" sets woozy string bends pitching over plodding drums in a sort of darkly coursing, gritty sludge. ""I Learn the Hard Way"" is twangy, undistorted blues, authentically spacious, and ""Beneath the Earth"" is stoner rock, albeit not the kind that interacts with being stoned in a more interesting way than any other sonic stimulus, but the kind that's stoner rock because people who listen to it tend to be stoners.</p><p> 
    
    Such tautologies are endemic to modern classic rock. It's self-defining, a recursive circuit-- you can tell good rock from bad rock because the former rocks and the latter doesn't. I want music to interact with the moment we inhabit now, and the most frustrating thing to me about modern classic rock is how closed and final it seems, how unavailable to the living, breathing moment. Serious Rock Dude would argue that I'm over-thinking it, and he would be right. The correct response to <em>The Indian Tower</em> is to give one's limbic system over to it, blank-brained, but for me it's like watching a favorite movie I've seen too many times for its rehearsed drama to produce anything more than the mildest euphoria. Regardless, <em>The Indian Tower</em> rocks in the most literal sense of the word; if that means anything to you, it's really all you need to know. </p></div>"|6591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6591-the-indian-tower/|5.8|Brian Howe

    downer parade. One of the more alluring soloists is English bard Mat
    Sweet, who records as Boduf Songs. On his self-titled debut he shares a
    similar one-sheet with fellow countryman Duncan Sumpner, aka Songs of
    Green Pheasant, but where the latter plots a course through shimmering
    Simon &amp; Garfunkel psychedelia, Boduf Songs wanders into gloomier
    terrain.</p><p>
    Sweet resides in Southampton and runs the small imprint, Blue Baby
    Recordings, on which he first issued this LP as a CD-R. As such, he's self-released a number of his own projects,
    including Map of Hell's doom sludge, the ambient drone of Pistol At Dawn With
    Afterglow, and Four Man Ghost's fuzzed Mogwai post-rock. Other Sweet
    offshoots include Randolph Carter (yo, H.P. Lovecraft), Heavy
    Manufacturing Concern, and History of Electricity. As Boduf Songs,
    Sweet strums gently, darkening the sound with discreet bits of noise
    and desolate Current 93-style lyrics-- the opener, ""Puke a Pitch Black
    Rainbow to the Sun"", presents a good example of both inclinations
    (i.e. the death of summer lyrically; backward guitar smashed against
    dainty arpeggios).</p><p>
    Standing in contrast to the album's Victorian cover art, these nine austere pieces drift by in less than 30 minutes. (Where Sweet does link with the ornamentation is his antiquarian language á la
    ""fallow fields"" and ""august fortunes""). Like Samara Lubelski, Sweet
    adds almost imperceptible touches-- more noticeably, there are the piercing feedback
    peals of what sounds like a bent saw on ""Claimant Reclaimed"" and bells woven into guitar
    rattles on ""Our Canon of Transportation"". Whatever the apparent
    similitude, piano, cymbals, bowed everything, and sheets of computer
    peals materialize over time. As with David Thomas Broughton, the
    slight gradations create a space for hypnosis; but while Sweet and
    Broughton share the downhearted William Blake thing, there's less
    rawness and pastoralism, more craven, craggy, and brooding meditation in Boduf Songs' whisper.</p><p>
    His talent as an arranger offers various shades of black. The instrumental ""Our Canon
    of Transposition"" finds castanets or censors clanging against an
    ominous woodblock and reversed sound sheets. At one point, a murkier sound sinks the tone of
    the piece, introducing a more frantic edge to the construction. ""Lost
    in Forests"" pairs chirpy field recordings and Oren Ambarchi-style
    gleams (kind of like skipping dusty fractals across a brook). 
    ""Vapour Steals the Glow"" lodges an underwater mallet into a drone
    scape and then broadcasts it over AM radio. These miscellaneous
    accents are beyond restrained, existing not so much as separate
    flourishes, but rather accrued, integrated details.</p><p>
    This know-how is occasionally his undoing: Sweet enlarges his general
    sound here/there, but the sad sack whisper and brushwood guitar remain
    the same. The tempo's boosted with the raga instrumental, ""Ape Thanks
    Lamb""-- think Six Organs and the Sun City Girls-- but his preferred
    pace is encapsulated in the opening sigh and 1-2-3 of ""Oh Celebrate
    Your Vague Words and Coquettish Sovereignty"". It's that soporific Iron
    &amp; Wine hemisphere.</p><p>
    So while the album's a well-composed suite, the Catch-22 remains:
    Certain pieces suffer from <i>too much</i> uniformity. As mentioned
    above, the material's a couple of years old. From what I hear, there will
    be a new collection in the fall, and at that point-- two Boduf albums
    in hand-- it'll be interesting to assess Sweet's understated poetics,
    to uncover what connections bridge the final track of this collection
    and the dawn of his next chapter. For now, search out some opium and a
    black light and commence nodding.</p></div>"|1193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1193-boduf-songs/|7.0|Brandon Stosuy

    recognition to match the easy likeability of his music. Maybe it's his
    pokey output-- two full-lengths in five years, and nothing since
    2003. Maybe it's his name, which isn't as pleasing to the ear or as
    catchy as, say, M83. But Schnauss' two very different albums are
    obvious go-tos for someone looking for melodic IDM working within the
    framework of pop.</p><p>
    We remember Schnauss last from 2003's <em>A Strangely Isolated Place</em>, a
    record that found him enveloped in a neo-shoegaze glow, allowing a
    reverence for Slowdive, first explored on his cover of ""Crazy for You""
    from the Morr tribute album, to run wild. Relative to that widescreen
    odyssey of layered guitar, Schnauss started more simply. On his 2001
    debut album, recently issued in the States for the first time with a
    bonus disc, he was practicing the sort of bubbly instrumental
    electro-pop Morr has made famous.</p><p>
    Boards of Canada usually comes up when discussing this sound, but
    Schnauss' music is really too sunny and upbeat to warrant the
    comparison. There's no undercurrent of darkness or dread to be found
    on <em>Far Away Trains Passing By</em>; while the music might be described as
    ""cinematic,"" it would be a soundtrack to some bittersweet, but
    nonetheless uplifting, scene. Something about the texture of the
    synths and ascending chords suggests the dénouement of an 80s teen
    film, where the geek, while failing to get the girl, walks proudly
    into the distance with his self-esteem intact.</p><p>
    Though there is some variety in the beats-- the ""popcorn"" electro
    percussion on ""Blumenwiese Neben Autobahn"", the loping groove of
    ""Nobody's Home"", whose warmth suggests a debt to Ultramarine-- the
    record as a whole is unified and consistent, moving steadily from one
    thoughtful little tune to the next. The bonus disc of B-sides, comp
    tracks, and the like is very much of a piece, suggesting that Schnauss
    was during this period working to master a very specific parcel of
    sonic real estate. He pretty much got there, but as the cover of
    ""Crazy For You"" included on the bonus disc makes plain, he had better
    things in store. For while <em>Far Away Trains Passing By</em> is a nice
    listen, this music begs for a riskier approach, something with bolder
    strokes and an infusion of drama that risks cheesiness.</p></div>"|7026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7026-far-away-trains-passing-by/|6.9|Mark Richardson

    for fawning over these Philly-bred dad-rock roustabouts? After all, brothers Dave
    and Serge Bielanko have made a semi-career out of tapping into the
    same classic rock mainlines-- ramshackle glory, me-against-whatever
    loner rebellion-- that defined such aging pundits' youth.</p><p>
    
    ""There is still a part of me that persists in thinking that rock
    music, and indeed all art, has an occasional role to play in the
    increasingly tricky art of making us glad we're alive,"" wrote Hornby
    in a sycophantic Marah-boosting 2004 <em>New York Times</em>
    editorial. For him, these unshowered schmucks are the benevolent
    ghosts of rock &amp; roll past, nudging his mind back to a time when his
    heart pumped more diligently. When ""alive"" meant living-- not looking
    back with nostalgia clouding the frame. So <em>If You Didn't Laugh,
    You'd Cry</em> isn't a bad album in the same way a '70s homeless-beard
    Bruce recreation at Madam Tussaud's isn't a bad work of wax sculpture.
    Marah may be fun to take silly pictures with but their fifth album
    continues to prove they're hardly interested in expanding upon
    the genuine articles they so lovingly revere.</p><p>
    
    After a failed attempt to toy with their formula-- 2002's
    Britpop-a-go-go disaster <em>Float Away With the Friday Night Gods</em>-- the Bielankos and their rotating cast of shaggy placeholders again returned to the 70s with <em>20,000 Streets Under the Sky</em>. <em>IYDLYC</em>, made of off-the-cuff
    live takes, is noticeably spunkier than its return-to-form
    predecessor, and the closest
    Marah have come to capturing the spontaneous energy of 2000's <em>Kids in Philly</em>.</p><p>
    
    Like their Asbury idol, over time these boys have grown more reliant on traditional song structure rather than endless rambles. But when Springsteen condensed his free-wielding local
    tangents, he did so with an ambition and gusto that made every song
    distinct. There's no such striving here. Alongside ready-made Miller
    beer jingles (""The Closer"", ""Sooner or Later"") doleful, dumbed-down
    Dylan larceny (""The Dishwasher's Dream""), and the requisite tiresome
    underclass anthem (""Poor People""), Marah manage only two moments of
    transcendence.</p><p>
    
    ""Walt Whitman Bridge"" recalls about
    357 other memorable acoustic guitar/harmonica ditties but
    trumps most of them. You know what's up-- a lonely walk across a
    storied Philadelphia passageway, wind whipping, nicotine and caffeine
    warming insides, restless, loveless. The track indulges in the group's
    best kept secret: carefully calibrated vocal harmonies that make
    slight lines like ""Fall away from these winter streets/ On a cloudless
    day/ Your memory blows away from me"" sound newly discovered and
    poignant. Meanwhile, winsome ballad ""So What If We're Outta
    Tune (w/ The Rest Of The World)"" recalls Extreme's ""More Than Words""
    in the best way possible. Of course, the it's-just-you-and-me-honey
    outlook is overwrought, but its naivety is
    becoming. Many of the song's lines also double as a bittersweet
    acknowledgement of Marah's endearing underdog status (""Strainin' our
    voices to no consequence...Dreaming out our choruses and slow sad middle
    eights""). Both songs beg to be centerpieces for future pivotal scenes
    in Cameron Crowe films.</p><p>
    
    In a way, when Springsteen lent his guitar and vocal talents to
    Marah's ""Float Away"" four years ago, he fucked them. For a band whose
    existence is an exalted form of Boss worship, the
    guest spot seemed like a tribute band's final triumphant coup. Yet
    Marah go on singing sung songs while lifelong rock fans pretend not to
    remember them.</p></div>"|5103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5103-if-you-didnt-laugh-youd-cry/|5.5|Ryan Dombal

    their debut album in the UK, more than the rest of the
    top 20 combined. It's a startingly high figure not
    just because they're set to be the Biggest New Band
    Since Oasis but because of the speed with which
    they've gatecrashed their nation's public
    consciousness, going from unknown indie band to No. 1
    on the singles charts in roughly six months. Much of
    the credit for that quick rise is rightly given to the
    power of the internet: The then-unsigned band first
    caught the public ear when its demos circulated last
    year. The Sheffield quartet eventually signed with
    Domino and the label wisely hosted the buzzmaking
    tracks, a move that allowed anticipation for the
    group's studio recordings to spread rather than stall.
    Two No. 1 singles, a few breathless reviews, and a
    load of thinkpieces about how The Internet Will Change
    Music Forever later and in the UK the Arctic Monkeys
    are suddenly the biggest band of the decade.</p><p>
    
    It would be nice to think that a democratized music
    industry would mean the kids are tossing up
    alternatives to what they're already getting, but the
    Arctic Monkeys are, at their heart, the same sort of
    meat'n'potatoes guitar rock that has dominated the UK
    since the emergence of the Strokes, if not Oasis.
    They're a band that neatly sums up what's already
    selling, and in a relatively condensed media market
    the group was always going to be a hit; what's changed
    is that they were pegged quickly, mainlined to their
    target market and the UK mainstream press and radio
    for six months, then called an organic success story.
    (America, don't get smug: Your biggest download
    success to date is ""My Humps"".) And context still
    matters: When Oasis or the Strokes rolled into town,
    they were breaths of fresh air, antidotes to a lack of
    swagger or hooks or artists who wanted and deserved to
    be rock stars; Arctic Monkeys are yet another in a
    string of buzzsaw guitar bands with Northern
    accents.</p><p>
    
    What's meant to be different about them are sometimes
    keenly expressive lyrics and that irresistible
    backstory. The band's more starry-eyed backers compare
    their hardscrabble tales to those of predecessors such
    as the Specials, Smiths, Pulp, and the Streets. But
    wringing lyrics from the everyday or articulating the
    dissatisfaction of many is risky and difficult
    business and, unlike those listed above, the Monkeys
    aren't so much spinning deft tales of quotidian
    anxiety as just complaining about their first steps
    into nightlife, run-ins with bouncers, cops, and
    schoolmates. So they're the UK's emo, painting
    diaristic portraits of small-town and suburban life
    for teens in a country where fundamentalism is
    allegiance to a soccer club rather than religion.</p><p>
    
    Hey, fair play to them-- first steps into nightlife,
    run-ins with bouncers, cops, and schoolmates, these
    <em>should</em> be the worries in their lives, and of
    their peers they're among the best at addressing them.
    Almost everything that's appealing about Arctic
    Monkeys is down to singer Alex Turner, who possesses a
    gritty voice that gets increasingly appealing the more
    he allows it to stretch and wander. On sharp,
    observational, and detail-heavy <em>Saturday Night and
    Sunday Morning tracks like the ""Red Lights
    Indicate Doors Are Secure"", ""Mardy Bum"", and ""Riot
    Van"" the band justifies taking their album name from
    the kitchen-sink drama. (Though it's still terrible--
    alas, </em><em>Don't Let the Bastards Get You Down</em> was
    already taken). Outside of naming their record, when
    the band stumbles it's typically when they're fumbling
    around with women (""Dancing Shoes"", ""Still Take You
    Home"") or complaining about the onset of fame (the
    dreadful ""Perhaps Vampires Is a Bit Strong
    But..."").</p><p>
    
    The singles are a mixed bag. The <em>Five Minutes
    With...</em> EP's ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"" is a
    witty call to arms, a plea for bands that say
    something about their lives, but ""From the Ritz to the
    Rubble""'s whining almost makes you want to side with
    the bouncers. Of the Monkeys' starmaking tracks,
    neither sounds like a No. 1, let alone the first
    sounds from a burgeoning sensation: ""I Bet You Look
    Good on the Dancefloor"" grates every other time I
    listen to it; better is the offbeat ""When the Sun Goes
    Down"", the only track here that's three-dimensional
    structurally as well as lyrically. Should the band
    release album closer ""A Certain Romance"" as its next
    single, the hit/miss ratio will be greatly improved. A
    long sigh about living among chavs, ""Romance"" finds
    the Monkeys moving between bloody-knuckled and wistful
    as they paint a picture of boredom breeding violence,
    of being aware of the faults and faultlines in their
    environment but feeling too powerless or hemmed in by
    loyalty to raise a fuss. It's a neat summation of both
    the band's m.o. and a teenage life characterized by
    existential drift and geographic claustrophobia.</p><p>
    
    And in the end then this is about teenage life-- and a
    pretty specific type of teenage life at that.
    <em>NME</em> editor Conor McNicholas told <em>The
    Guardian last year that ""there's a big sofa
    supermarket by Doncaster train station. I always look
    at it and think someone's got a Saturday job there,
    they're 17, they're stuck in Doncaster and they
    fucking hate it-- that's the person we're publishing
    for."" I'd guess that to a disaffected, chavbaiting
    17-year-old from Doncaster (or Rotherham, or Hull...)
    this is the perfect soundtrack to moving loveseats
    around a stock room. Fittingly then the </em><em>NME</em>
    awarded this album a 10/10. To the rest of us,
    however, the album is at times charming, oddly
    affecting, and certainly promising but understandably
    something less than life changing.</p></div>"|497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/497-whatever-people-say-i-am-thats-what-im-not/|7.4|Scott Plagenhoef

Bad rip? Speakers fucking with me? Nah. The perennially ahead-of-the-curve Plastic Constellations' third album is just their first on a cushy budget, so it's easy to confuse the beefy high-fidelity for some Frenchkiss engineer's mistake. Anyone who listened carefully to <em>Mazatlan</em> and <i>Let's War-- living wage gigs for minor-league labels-- caught making-do vibrations; between guitars chugged thin, drums played loud but hit weak, parts got buried or stood out bull's-eye obvious. But here the band made like architects and turned its limitations into resources, fattening with volume and part-doubling in lieu of reverb and filters. Their effort amounts to a convincing facsimile of a high school punk show for the ages.</i></p><p>
    
    So cut the ""they only know one dynamic!"" guff and relish the hugeness of ""Phoenix and the Faultline""'s chordal introduction. Can we take a minute to acknowledge the big stupid gloriousness of standalone guitar chords? The Constys give us only six seconds before launching into a Manute Bol of a hook-- a lanky, impossibly long eighth-note riff that shouldn't be half as catchy, considering its length. The song paces <em>Crusades</em>, which hammers track upon track of staunchly guitar-centric riff-rock. ""The guitars will make the Earth shake,"" boasts ""Quixote"". Hardly-- Sunn O))) these guys ain't-- but that track's piano-dripping trapeze act of a chorus might raise a few dead, while ""Iron City Jungles"" aims its jackknifing guitars with riot-inciting intent.</p><p>     
    
    Here's a band that lives and dies by anthemic riffs, yet understands perfectly the hollowness of their gestures. Even (or especially) <em>Crusades</em>' best licks have difficulty connecting with their rank-and-file underpinnings. ""Sancho Panza""'s Big Harmony chorus refuses resolution, alienating itself from the verse, but in a winning way. Swinging ""Men in Dark Times""'s triumphant outro is like taking guacamole on your turkey-and-swiss-- terrible idea, hard to refuse. But conviction and technical certainty enable Plastic Constellations to play off, as a kind of no-regrets transient indulgence, the chiffon rapture of even their most blustery lines.</p><p>  
    
    Anyway, rarely do albums come this taut anymore-- 35 minutes, no acoustic pussyfooting or tortoise-tempo sensitive moments. Yes, <em>Crusades</em> is a consistent album, staggeringly so. Ha, no see that's not an inherently good thing! I'll shy from ""heard it once, heard it all"" derision, but <em>Crusades</em> corrects some of <em>Mazatlan</em>'s most compelling failings, like its done-on-the-cheap warmth or its penchant for sloppy genre-hopping. Instead we get expertness in place of exuberance, a trade off even green-faced basement-rehearsing post-punk <em>wunderkinds</em> must make eventually. So how to subsume the 20-something set without estranging the kids? Learn some dynamics I guess.</p></div>"|6543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6543-crusades/|7.8|Sam Ubl

    the late 1970s, the city of Leeds earned a reputation as a salient point of
    response to the country's chronic economic recession. Tightly knit groups such
    as Gang of Four, the Mekons, and Delta 5 rose out of the realms of Leeds'
    universities and provided a social platform for its particularly politicized
    students. Ros Allen and Bethan Peters, both on bass and vocals, originally
    formed Delta 5 because they ""felt left out"" of the city's burgeoning music
    scene, although this apparent caprice quickly developed into reality with the
    addition of deadpan vocalist Julz Sale, guitarist Alan Riggs, and one-time Gang
    of Four drummer Kelvin Knight.</p><p>
    
    Gang of Four received considerable recognition during this period, and they were
    name-checked throughout the recent post-punk revival. Despite Delta 5's musical
    similarity, the group remained on the sidelines, without much commercial
    success. This assortment of early Rough Trade singles, Peel
    sessions, and live recordings, shows just how effective the group's tense,
    barbed breed of dark pop was-- and it's a shame that this is only being fully
    recognized in hindsight. The disc opens with their first single and best known
    track, ""Mind Your Own Business"", and runs in chronological order
    through A and B sides, ending on an atypically visceral plea for individuality
    on ""Colour"". With their unusual, dub-heavy rhythmic section and acerbic stagger
    of triple female vocals, Delta 5 articulated a variety of textures and
    approaches to song structure. Riggs' guitar is particularly striking, providing
    an expressive attack of tones that cut through the sharp social commentary with
    stingingly sweet precision. And while the vocals have a distinctly monochromatic
    and disdainful edge, they are never devoid of character and the dialogue between
    the women is carried by their assertively sarcastic wit. This paradox of
    astringency and humor provides rich yet unsentimental facets for topics ranging
    from infidelity and feminism to suspicion. Most importantly, though, this is
    music you can really dance to--
    tracks such as ""You"" and ""Triangle"" practically command movement from the
    listener from the first insistent beat.</p><p>
    
    The purpose of <em>Singles &amp; Sessions</em> is to document Delta 5's short existence in a
    coherent format, since most of their early vinyl is out of print. But the
    strength and vitality of this collection of songs is also a point of
    frustration. Had this been released as the group's album in 1981, instead of the
    over produced and comparatively weak <em>See The Whirl?</em>, Delta 5 would have created
    a debut as impressive and culturally resonant as <em>Entertainment!</em>. As it is
    however, this excellent compilation has given new life to a brief,
    great band almost lost within the fug of post-punk's prolific heyday.</p></div>"|2633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2633-singles-sessions-1979-81/|8.3|Mia Lily Clarke

Singer and guitarist Aaron With yanks and pops at the strings while showing off his versatile voice, veering between gently lulling and operatic from song to song.</p><p>
    
    While their many detours might have you thinking volcano! are freeform-- or worse, improvisational-- they're not out to destroy their songs. The melody underneath is always discrete, and the singer's croon is always grounded. After some tentative plucking and plinking in the opener, the cacophonous pummeling and wailing of ""Easy Does It"" slips in and out of time, making sudden stops for unhinged caterwauling replete with accordion. ""Fire Fire"" has a more fluid rhythm, beginning with a gorgeous anticipatory stall before the drums fade in and resuscitate a slippery post-rock specter, though not without a percussion break where With asks in a sinister whisper, ""What's in gonna take to get your freak on?"" before shredding the strings of his guitar.</p><p>
    
    Over the floating chimes of ""40,000 plus interest,"" With gently wails about his broken-down minivan and the massive debt gathered from college, switches to Spanish for the unaccompanied vocal solo of ""La Lluvia"", and pulls out slam-poet inflection for ""Apple and a Gun"". The band doesn't just skirt pretension; <em>Beautiful Seizure</em> is a full-on wrestling match with it. But out of it all comes a stunning and consistently melodic middle ground that never teases or withholds anything, always sputtering towards catharsis without losing grip of the listener's hand. Even if With shows indulgence in the lyrics (or by reprinting them in fucking IPA on the band's Web site), it's forgiven and forgotten after hearing how sharp Volcano! are as a trio, yanking With up from ""$40,000"" by the scruff of his neck and tossing him into the marching chaos of ""Red and White Bells"", anchoring ""Apple and a Gun"" with an infectious two-chord stomp, and elevating the leaden title of ""Pulling My Face In and Out of Distortion, I Blink Too Much"" with a woozy horn section, almost inaudible above the arresting wreck of the finale.</p></div>"|8544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8544-beautiful-seizure/|7.4|Jason Crock

    discs I've come across recently. Brendan Fowler, the man behind the 
    project, has been referred to as a motivational rapper, a comedian, 
    even a performance artist. Not quite a beat poet, not quite a 
    storyteller, he speak-sings strange little abstracts over simple 
    drumbeats, low-mixed bass, and the occasional piano. Some tracks are 
    funny, some sad; others are annoying or downright puzzling.</p><p>
    
    Many of the songs here are conversational and personal. I'm 
    reminded of Manhattan tour guide Timothy ""Speed"" Levitch in Bennett 
    Miller's documentary <em>The Cruise</em>, who seems to speak to 
    everyone and no one at once. Much like Levitch's pointed commentaries 
    and criticisms, Fowler's words may leave the speaker and enter your 
    ear, but often it is clear that he's really talking to someone very 
    specific, possibly even himself. You're left listening to one side 
    of a conversation about situations you're unfamiliar with and people 
    you don't know.</p><p>
    
    In ""Like, I Used to Like"" he complains, ""It made sense that she was 
    stressed, the way that motherfuck-face gave her the runaround about 
    her mortgage on her place. It really made me mad!"" This sort of 
    random conversation is par for the course. At times, his lyrics are 
    pseudo-philosophical. ""Anx-Worth It"" is a 48-second musing on 
    recurring negativity, and how putting bad feelings on tape can at 
    least make him feel less lonely the next time the feeling 
    rolls around. Elsewhere the words are nostalgic, as if Fowler is 
    reminiscing, recording memories before they slip away. ""Us"" is a sad, 
    frustrated explanation of how his father's death relates to the BARR 
    concept. He voices his concern about exploiting personal pain for 
    music. ""He died and he's dead and what does that mean? What if it 
    wasn't that way? It is what it is,"" he philosophizes. In a different 
    setting, it may come off as pretentious or hokey, but in this 
    stripped down, personal setting, it's more like your own inner 
    dialogue than some dude trying to be poignant. </p><p>
    
    It's difficult to look at <em>Beyond Reinforced Jewel Case</em> on 
    the same terms as a CD of traditional music. The first time I 
    gave it a spin, I groaned, wondering how painful it 
    would be to get through. But by the second song I was engrossed, and 
    I listened intently until it ended. So on the surface, it is an 
    incredibly enjoyable listen. But when it comes to replay, I can't say 
    I'm often moved to pop this in. It's not driving music, working 
    music, party music, or background music of any kind. So, while it 
    does offer a rich, unique listening experience, it unfortunately 
    lacks staying power. </p></div>"|1194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1194-beyond-reinforced-jewel-case/|6.4|Cory D. Byrom

On her solo debut and her most soul/country record to date, Lewis' vocals sparkle and the intimate performances make a great first impression, but ultimately, the material grounds her.</p><p>
    
    The production is arresting: The engineers-- primarily Bright Eyes guy Mike Mogis-- are always ready for Jenny Lewis' close-ups, from the soaring a cappella opening track to the acoustic ballads, where they adoringly catch the strengths and nuances of her crisp, clear alto. The Watson Twins also earn their album co-credit with big gospel harmonies. (And the twin thing doesn't hurt: dig their <em>Shining</em>-esque pose on the front cover.) The twins are a winning addition to every song on which they appear, although they sound so good that you start to take them for granted. It's not that they sound good <i>here</i>, so much as they would sound good anywhere; they could back up Khanate and still turn heads.</p><p>
    
    But on repeated listens, the songwriting makes the album lukewarm. The melodies feel textbook, and the lyrics disappoint; they're often unwieldy (like the flurries of multisyllabic words on ""You Are What You Love"") or vaguely nonsensical (the title song seems heartbreaking, but just try to parse it). This material lacks the grace or the wit that could make the songs sizzle: a line like, ""When you're sleeping with someone who doesn't get you/ You're gonna hate yourself in the morning,"" lacks the clean punch of, say, ""I may hate myself in the morning/ But I'm gonna love you tonight."" (It's not even a ""This One's for the Girls"".)</p><p>
    
    While the spare acoustic arrangements suit Lewis' voice, they don't lend themselves to the hooks and idiosyncracies that made Rilo Kiley. Lewis put far more on the line in her band's ""I Never"", and although that song has a bit of kitsch, its ruby red cowboy boots stomp on the toes of most of this album. In fact, more than any indie country album in months, <em>Rabbit Fur Coat</em> makes me question why indie singers put on their cowboy hats in the first place. The classy folk and Americana that Lewis invokes here never goes deeper than an aesthetic decision, and she's better at talking about bad times than bringing them to life-- or making them go away.</p><p>
    
    That's also why the lone cover on the record, of the Traveling Wilburys' ""Handle With Care"", doesn't bug me. Some Fork staffers hate this cut with a burning bile, especially when Lewis invites Conor Oberst, Ben Gibbard, and M. Ward to sit by her campfire and share the vocals.  I just think it's cute that the quartet set themselves up as aged Bob Dylans or Roy Orbisons-- even if it's an easier sell to aim a few years younger and call them our generation's Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Stephen Stills, and, of course, Linda Ronstadt.</p></div>"|4998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4998-rabbit-fur-coat/|6.1|Chris Dahlen

His music with the Elected is just that affable, outrageously fun in a schmaltzy way, spit-polished, and trouser-creased. <em>Sun, Sun, Sun</em> is a modern pop simulacrum of traditional country, devoid of the electro accents that pocked the last Elected record, pretty delectable as long as you've a strong taste for ham.</p><p> 
    
    If <em>Sun</em> can even be called Country &amp; Western, the emphasis should be firmly planted on the dextral side of the ampersand, given the songs' bright and spotless Califormica surfaces. As Sennett dreamily contemplates getting away from something or other, the jolly melancholy of ""Would You Come with Me"" is telegraphed by silvery string-bends gliding through its gentle twang; ""It was Love"" glints with moony lap-steel courtesy of Mike...Bloom (thought I was going to say ""Mogis"", didn't you?). If the emotions are earnest, the glitzy presentation makes them seem fake in the same way that Las Vegas plasticizes desire. But the swoony pop frissons come fast and often enough that you don't really have to dwell on it.</p><p> 
    
    By combining the penetrating wussiness and mincing prosody of Elliott Smith with the emo theatrics and big sappy choruses of Conor Oberst (check out the sculpted, harmony-drenched surges of ""Not Going Home""), Sennett has turned out an album of sparkly country slow-dances that sound at once utterly artificial and genuinely beguiling. ""Did Me Good"" is genre exercise in charming kitsch, with its barrelhouse pianos, jaunty organs, and saxophone-flourishes answering Sennett's titular refrain. It's winning in a way that seems canned, an emotional laugh-track, and it's hard to not feel a little violated by its relentless pageantry. </p><p> 
    
    Sennett's aesthetic is less problematic when he sticks to maudlin anglicanisms: ""But man I loved/ Yeah I loved/ When I loved/ It was love."" Simple and credible, endearingly obvious and courageously scoffable. This is country music that mythologizes the affluent 'burbs and their attendant heartaches more than those of impoverished backwater outposts, and when Sennett sings faux-soulful lines like ""That's all right, Jack"", it scans as equal parts young-white-dude-irony and young-white-dude-longing-for-authentic-experience, which isn't necessarily an attractive combination. But for what it's worth, while it seems as if the former child-actor has only outgrown half of the hyphenation, the aforementioned conflict is probably the realest thing to be found on <em>Sun, Sun, Sun</em>. </p></div>"|2902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2902-sun-sun-sun/|6.8|Brian Howe

M. Cornog-- the man behind East River Pipe-- caught his reflection in a shiny pimpmobile paint-job and the glare of store windows lit by garish neon signs. He focused his withdrawal-fueled desires and fears on the gleaming surfaces around him, vividly evoking a rootless urban lifestyle and creating an impossibly absorbing and accidentally amazing album, the kind that springs more from luck than from intention. Adding to its mystique, <em>The Gasoline Age</em> seemed to extend directly from Cornog's backstory: He had been homeless and drug-addled for years, until a friend took him in, cleaned him up, encouraged his songwriting, bought him his signature Tascam 388, and eventually married him.</p><p>
    
    It's a well-deserved happy ending to a once-sad tale, even if Cornog continues to live in the shadow of <em>The Gasoline Age</em>. Two albums and nearly six years later, he's presumably cleaned up and more stable but still conflicted on the subject of drugs. <em>What Are You On?</em>, his sixth album, lives up to its title: It's full of drug songs, cruel kiss-offs, and oddball robot odes, all awash in his signature synth-heavy sound. That relatively lo-fi aesthetic remains surprisingly durable and idiosyncratic, especially on the doo-wop space anthems ""Crystal Queen"" and ""I'll Walk My Robot Home"". Compared to these more whimsical songs, drug ballads like the title track, ""Druglife"", and ""Some Dreams Can Kill You"" sound dour and defensive.</p><p>
    
    Cornog's old life obviously still haunts and inspires him, but <em>What Are You On?</em> nevertheless lacks a real subject. Unlike <em>The Gasoline Age</em>, this album has nothing for him to fixate on, no intermediary to connect all of his notions and needs. These songs are more direct-- and that isn't necessarily a good thing. <em>What Are You On?</em> bristles with unchecked bitterness that often curdles into condescension. Like to read <i>The Wasteland? Well, Cornog thinks you're a tool: On ""What Does T. S. Eliot Know About You?"" he answers his own question by declaring, ""He knows absolutely nothing/ But you talk and talk as if he do."" Never mind that such a sentiment seems to miss a larger point about making and experiencing art (including his own), but that curmudgeonliness infects nearly all these songs, especially ""The Ultrabright Bitch"" and ""You Got Played, Little Girl"", which bridle with hostility.  Without something to catch Cornog's reflection and refract his frustrations-- to make him seem human-- <em>What Are You On?</em> is a deeply unfriendly album.</i></p></div>"|2660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2660-what-are-you-on/|5.8|Stephen M.

The Tour"" trotted Providence heroes Lightning Bolt and Arab on Radar around the country, sparking a wave of jaw-gaping press coverage. But if that was The Year Noise Broke, it was also the year Arab on Radar Broke-- squabbling, disbanding, and eventually dispersing into two neighboring camps sharing only the old 'Graft home. The Chinese Stars, which combined AOR vocalist Eric Paul and drummer Craig Kureck with former Six Finger Satellite guy Richard Ivan Pelletier, dropped first with <i>Turbo Mattress</i> in 2003, and struck again over the summer with another EP, <i> T.V. Grows Arms</i>; now Made in Mexico, featuring Radar refugee guitarist Jeff Schneider, get their crack at the post-post-rock spoils.</p><p>
    
    In their heyday, Arab on Radar looked a strong Devo influence in the eye and said, ""Yes, but we are still men."" A semen-obsession followed, detouring only for sodomy (and hard-ons). While they irked some with misogyny and scatology, worse was nihilism so thick it denied ""Satisfaction"" no matter where it came from. Undoing what Devo had already undone, they ended in a gimmick bind so thick that their constricted and jerky on-stage shtick read as metaphor. The Chinese Stars, last checked, were digging deeper into this kind of nothingness; on <i>Zodiac Zoo</i>, Made in Mexico have only begun to U-turn out of the dirt.</p><p>
    
    Arab on Radar walked the walk but backed down like schoolyard bullies; their website, circa 9/12, read, ""In light of the events now taking place at this point in history Arab on Radar feel that it is important that we address the issues surrounding our band's name."" Made in Mexico, another nominal provocation, here stuck to its guns. ""Clockwork"" deadpans on Erase Errata basslines, but brakes for the breakdown: ""We're keeping the rich and fat/ Rich and fat/ And the ones more meek/ And the ones misused/ Are the trash."" Singer Rebecca Mitchell stutters halfway between the raw enunciation of Lydia Lunch and something more sweet-- maybe 'cause she knows it helps. ""Farewell Myth"" puts it like, ""They don't need words/ They have voice/ Through their terms they organised/ By their terms they rise so high;"" this is why she screams one half and sings the other. </p><p>
    
    But the other three dudes (in true Radar fashion) still shuck and jive in and out of Schneider's trademark aluminum-necked, metal on metal on metal screech. The chaos, with its ping-ponging bass and snare doubling every guitar hit, wears out what's worn out: ""Infrared Eye"" rips on a low-chugged bass, ""Occams Razor"" rides shotgun on the same idea, ""Solanas"" buries it. Only once do they lose the straightjacket for solos and free association, on ""Face of the Earth"", which unchains the high-end from the poor carthorse 1 2 3 4 repetition it's been stuck to since Schneider learned guitar from whatever factory machine taught him.</p><p>
    
    Big up noise that remains loyal to rock's two- or three-minute mark. But constantly just fucking sound jeopardizes what they look to save (songs, about stuff, I think). ""Black Rabbit"", according to Schneider, means to be ""the 21st Century answer to 'White Rabbit' now that we are sure the world is not going to survive much longer"": Dudes, stop trashing what taught you to trash.</p></div>"|5672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5672-zodiac-zoo/|5.6|Zach Baron

As a recent <i>Harp</i> magazine interview pointed out (in between Marshall's musings on interest rates, real estate, and finances), she's spent the past decade building a successful career without even employing a manager.  It's a feat that few, if any, of her contemporaries have been able to pull off-- and given that, at this very moment, a significant portion of the indie music world is salivating for tomorrow's release of the seventh Cat Power record, it would seem she's pulled it off quite well.</p>
<p>Of course, the Cat Power allure has always been tied up in Marshall's notoriously seasick live performances.  In 2001, the woman who jumped into the audience mid-performance and shoved me aside while tearfully fleeing the Irving Plaza stage certainly didn't seem capable of balancing a checkbook, let alone single-handedly negotiating a more generous contract with her record label (as the <i>Harp</i> article alleges).  But then, the public-vs.-private tightrope-walk is as old as marketing itself: Johnny Cash never shot a man in Reno, either.  Still, it's impossible to ignore the pull of the Beautifully Tortured stereotype, no matter what reality lies behind it.  But if we didn't want Beautifully Tortured, we'd be obsessing over Norah Jones.</p>
<p>That brings us to <i>The Greatest</i>.  Not to knock Norah, but she isn't tortured-- and neither is this album, which, if Nic Harcourt or VH1 get their hands on it, could be battling ""Don't Know Why"" for airplay supremacy on Mom's car stereo in the coming months.  Like all Cat Power records, <i>The Greatest</i> is a mostly sad, heartbroken, hopeless, rainy-day affair; it just isn't damaged.  For that reason, it's also going to gain her a lot of new fans.</p>
<p><i>The Greatest</i> was recorded in Memphis, with several of that city's veteran studio musicians serving as her backing band, including Mabon ""Teenie"" Hodges on guitar, his brother Leroy ""Flick"" Hodges on bass, and Steve Potts on drums.  These soul legends have played with Al Green, Booker T. and the MG's, Aretha Franklin, Neil Young, and more; in other words, they don't seem like the kind of dudes who'd stand much tortured diva bullshit from some no-name white girl off Matador Records.  These are first-rate professionals, and their contributions-- a far cry from those of Steve Shelley and Dirty Three, or even Eddie Vedder and Dave Grohl-- add as much to the album as they detract.</p>
<p>The title song opens the album with the same halting, thick-fingered piano style Marshall has relied on since 2000's <i>The Covers Record</i>, but here it's swathed in Henry Mancini strings, teary delay effects, gently nudging drums, and Marshall's own multi-tracked voice echoing her lead vocals like Mary and Flo on the Supremes' loveliest ballads.  ""The Greatest"", with its evocative lyrics of nostalgia and regret is, like ""Colors and the Kids"" and ""Good Woman"" before it, bleakness at its most pristine.</p>
<p>But Marshall doesn't wallow long, following the track with ""Living Proof"", Cat Power's most conventionally sexy song yet.  As it swaggers on lazy horns and careening ""Like a Rolling Stone"" organ, you can almost picture Marshall in a pair of tight jeans, swinging her hips in front of a jukebox.  ""Lived in Bars"" retains that Southern-fried sensuality in its back half: After beginning as a late-night smoky bar lament, the song lifts off on shoo-ba-doo harmonies and a bouncy beat; all of a sudden, it's getting hot and heavy in a pickup truck.</p>
<p>The marriage of Marshall's offbeat musical sensibility to her new backing band's in-the-pocket playing bears its most successful fruit on those three songs.  At heart, they're smooth, accessible lite-R&amp;B; tracks-- as close to <i>Chan in Memphis</i> as the album gets.  Still, if that's what adult-alternative sounds like in 2006, sign me up for the AARP.</p>
<p>But the middle chunk of <i>The Greatest</i> just feels old.  It's beyond ""adult"": These songs seem musty and outdated, like stuff my grandparents might have danced to during The War.  ""Could We"", ""Empty Shell"", ""Islands"", and ""After It All"" are all finger snaps and jazz hands, Marshall twirling her umbrella in the park as Fred Astaire woos her with clicked heels and a top hat. ""Thank you/ It was great/ Let's make/ Another date/ Real soon/ In the afternoon,"" Marshall purrs over call-and-response horns and hotel bar piano. ""After It All"" even features whistling and the kind of cabaret melody Nellie McKay drops into a song right before she threatens to kill you.</p>
<p>Worse is ""Where Is My Love"", the album's rock-bottom low.  Marshall moans the title ad infinitum (interspersed with ""bring him to me"" and stuff about horses galloping and running free) in some sort of high school musical approximation of Nina Simone.  She's accompanied only by Cheez Whiz piano scales and those same heart-tugging strings from ""The Greatest"", only this time they sound creepily manipulative, not heartbreaking or beautiful.  I envision Marshall in a fluffy white gown with a plunging neckline singing this song out of a balcony window.  At the end, a dove lands on her outstretched finger.  This is not what I want from Cat Power.  It's not what I want from <i>anybody</i>, not even Norah Jones.</p>
<p><i>The Greatest</i> regains its composure as it nears the finish line, ending with a pair of songs that wouldn't have seemed out of place on any Cat Power album since <i>What Would the Community Think</i>.  ""Hate"", the only track that might scare off newcomers while delighting her original fanbase, is Marshall alone with her guitar, playing stark, cutting riffs, and murmuring ""I hate myself and I want to die.""  ""Love and Communication"" is the album's first three tracks as viewed through a fun-house mirror: Instead of the Memphis crew welcoming Marshall into their world, the closing track sees Marshall luring the studio vets down her dark, claustrophobic alley.  The strings, horns, and organs press forward in deliberate staccato stabs, advancing on the ear as if programmed by Dr. Dre.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge of this album isn't going to be commercial success; just stick ""Could We"" on the soundtrack to a hip romantic comedy, and it'll take off on its own.  The difficult part will be proving to longtime fans that Chan Marshall is the one in control here.  She's made an album that, for the most part, is polished and accessible.  For better or worse, she's stretched her musical horizons far beyond the close-knit indie rock world-- a world that likely doesn't want her to change.</p></div>"|1346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1346-the-greatest/|7.9|Amy Phillips

    sphere inclined to embrace the underdog. Take Jason Zumpano,
    Sparrow frontman and former drummer for the mid-90s power pop outfit that
    shared his last name, as well as Destroyer. His band's self-titled debut
    was as flimsy and unremarkable as the band name would suggest-- a drab foil
    for former bandmate Carl Newman's flashy, ever-so-jubilant New
    Pornographers. Fortunately, a new label and better backing gives Sparrow a
    shot in the arm, and <em>The Early Years</em> feels more complementary to
    Newman's works rather than a degenerate version of it.</p><p>
    
    Lacking Newman's jaw-dropping twee-pop chops, Zumpano's arrangements hinge
    on efficiency and quaintness. Opening track ""Flower"" best showcases this
    damage control; horns, strings, and thumping ivories prop up Zumpano's
    thin croon, and the song's sweeping shuffle
    breathes life into the band's nostalgic musk. For the cherry on top,
    Zumpano tweaks his sometimes simplistic lyrics, further shrouding the otherwise
    straightforward pop songs with a layer of mystique. ""Flower"" culminates
    with the frustrated ""Why can't I see past the head of a flower?/ Why can't
    it be just the same?"", a vast improvement from previous lyrical quips like
    ""You are gone, and I am happy.""</p><p>
    
    Sparrow's wholesome 60s flavor can come across as distractingly retro. The title
    track's melody rips ""Classical Gas"" though keeps chugging along until
    Zumpano co-opts the hook for himself. Lush bridges and spontaneous
    breakdowns also help to spice up the samey verse-chorus-verse formula. ""I
    Wouldn't Mind"" is a sprawler for Sparrow, almost hitting five minutes
    thanks to a dramatic, <em>Picaresque</em> symphony interlude. ""So Far From
    Me"" further blurs the classic pop edges as sharp harmonies and languid
    violins loom like Elliott Smith-sized storm clouds over the beaming,
    carefree chorus.</p><p>
    
    All in all, <em>The Early Years</em> aims mid-level and consistently hits
    the target. The mostly mid-tempo track list creates a pervading coziness,
    each song melting unnoticeably into the next. Of course, the album's more
    than an old comfy afghan. Zumpano's newfangled hankering for melody
    sublimates the band's sound, propelling him from a what's-his-face Carl
    Newman associate to Jason Zumpano, former Carl Newman bandmate and singer
    of a pretty good band.</p></div>"|7726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7726-the-early-years/|7.1|Adam Moerder

These days, that same age group is a high supplier of dudes in bands, and as such, it's no surprise to find the Nintendo Entertainment System's early game soundtracks exerting an influence on modern music.  The unique sound produced
    by the console has lately been emulated by representatives from all genre corners, be it indie rock (Fiery Furnaces, Deerhoof), electronic music (Max Tundra, Jason Forrest), or hip-hop (Diplo's remix of Ludacris' ""What's Your Fantasy?"").  In most cases, those blips and beeps don't seem to be mere nostalgia exploitation, but rather evidence of NES music's lingering subconscious influence, musical touchstones as familiar as Beatles references were for an earlier generation of artists.</p><p>
    
    The Advantage, of course, represent the most literal faction of this phenomenon, with their four-piece instrumental rock covers of assorted level themes and boss music.  Far from being the only band practicing this approach (see also: the Minibosses, the Power-Ups, NESkimos, etc.), they're nevertheless the NES translators with the most star-power, featuring one half of Hella and assorted other noise-scene moonlighters.  But where some practitioners of 8-bit revival coast along on kitsch, the Advantage do more than just tickle your retro bone-- an, erm, advantage
    that was hinted at on their self-titled 2004 platter and is brought to full realization here on the cutely-named <em>Elf-Titled</em>.</p><p>
    
    Substantially upgrading the fidelity, and stepping away from the more obvious titles they've already covered-- your <i>Mario</i>s, <i>Zelda</i>s, and <i>Bubble Bobble</i>s-- <em>Elf-Titled</em> is more stylistically explorative than their reflective, scrapbooky debut.  Game composers designed music that was meant to loop infinitely without growing tiresome too quickly, resulting in brilliantly complex, maze-like melodies that the Advantage are all too happy to make their own.  With guitars executing tightly choreographed, noodly maneuvers through songs like <i>Bomberman 2</i>'s ""Wiggy"" or the music from the ""Metal Man"" stage of <i>Mega Man 2</i>, the band amps up the originals to reveal the songs as more than just background jingles.</p><p>
    
    Hella's Spencer Seim bears the heaviest interpretive burden, stepping up the drumwork on tunes that were, by necessity, percussively challenged.  While his contributions to the first album sometimes sounded unnecessarily rackety, more restrained playing and production tricks keep his kit from overshadowing the melodies here, as with the thick echo taking the gravity out of the dreamy ""Metroid: Kraid's Lair"".  But ""Solar Jetman: Braveheart Level"" demonstrates that fuller drumming can also beef up a song's potential, turning the thin original into a heroic, driving march.</p><p>
    
    It's inevitable that the Advantage will eventually run out of NES soundtracks worthy of revival and renewal.  But the surprisingly majestic run through the much-beloved <i>Duck Tales</i>' ""Moon Theme"" and the weirdly Tortoise-like take on a song from <i>Air Fortress</i> suggest the Advantage don't need to stop when the games are sucked dry, indicating that they've hit upon a kind of post-rock sound that isn't saddled with that genre's predilection towards joyless pretensions.  The next step is obviously to write original music in the vein of unsung NES composers'
    melodic pretzels, a task the Advantage themselves may or may not be equal to.  But by reimagining the 8-bit ditties lodged deep in our memory banks as electrified indie-prog, the band is opening the door to less direct explorations of its generation's hidden canon.</p></div>"|438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/438-elf-titled/|7.9|Rob Mitchum

Since originating in 1998 as essentially a solo project, the San Francisco outfit has swelled to a quintet, trading in the rotating cast of players from 2001's <i>A Brilliant Career</i> (which included ex-Pavement guitarist Scott Kannberg) for a steady lineup.  Like many proper debuts, <em>Film School</em> comes on the back of well-received demos and EPs, and it finds a band shaping an anthemic presence-- in this case, brooding post-goth awash in layered shoegaze squalls-- even if the anthems aren't quite there yet.</p><p>
    
    Despite a debt to such early-90s Brits as Slowdive, Film School's basis in the gloomier undercurrents of the current 80s-revival zeitgeist provides an easy retort to the misguided ""too soon""
    complaints that met fellow Valentine-bloodiers like Ambulance Ltd., Skywave, and Serena Maneesh.  The biggest departure from <em>Brilliant Career</em>, ""11:11"", rattles with a hip-jerking Joy Division or Interpol riff, while first single ""On &amp; On"" sweeps from dark Echo &amp; the Bunnymen dreamscapes to skittering hi-hats and crumbling guitars.  Faster tunes like ""Harmed"", ""Pitfalls"", and especially ""Breet"" share deceptively bouncy guitar lines with the Cure or stellastarr* amid the murk and cinematic distortion.</p><p>
    
    At times, Film School achieve a foggy, grandiose psychedelia, but their compositions aren't always as shimmering as their production.  Ethereal near-ballads ""He's a Deep, Deep Lake"" and ""Sick
    of the Shame"" are portentous in scale, spreading out over dramatic dynamic shifts and indistinct lyrics, but neither quite earns its five-minute-plus length.  Elsewhere, the backward-looping effects and swirling keyboards of the untitled opener and two-minute near-instrumental ""Garrison"" pale beside the more ambitious use of similar elements on Blur's ""Caramel"" or Talk Talk's ""New Grass"".</p><p>
    
    This diversity makes Film School difficult to pigeonhole, and that's to their advantage even when the results still don't blaze trails.  Penultimate ""Like You Know"" starts with gossamer noise before a prominent acoustic guitar places its wistful sentiment somewhere between ""Range Life"" and Elbow.  Another of <em>Film School</em>'s stronger songs is finale ""P.S."", a retread from 2003's <em>Alwaysnever</em> EP that floats a lazy Casio between the stuttering do-do's of founding member Krayg Burton, whose nonchalant Northern California mumbles conjure an unironic Stephen Malkmus. ""I'll end with a perfect splash today,"" Burton sings, diving into an overdriven guitar coda that hints at post-graduate promise.</p></div>"|3355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3355-film-school/|6.9|Marc Hogan

Nevertheless, it comes as a disappointment to hear on <em>Black Acetate</em> how readily Cale has moved from the role of unsatisfied innovator to that of willing follower. Claiming the likes of Pharrell, Gorillaz, and Dr. Dre as primary influences, here Cale squanders whatever momentum he accrued on the estimable avant-pop of 2003's <i>HoboSapiens by adorning these new songs with such unflattering, generic alternarock textures that they often render their author unrecognizable at best, and irrelevant at worst.</i></p><p>
    
    Recorded with the assistance of Herb Graham, Jr. (who has worked with Macy Gray) and Mickey Petralia (Beck, the Dandy Warhols, Eels) the arrangements on <em>Black Acetate</em> regularly abandon the orchestrated nuance of Cale's past work in favor of sallow trip-hop beats and restrained post-grunge guitars. It's an approach that makes unadvisably forceful demands of Cale's irritable, overspent larynx. Never a powerhouse vocalist, here Cale ignores the limitations of his voice to inhabit these tracks with an ambitious role-playing swagger.</p><p>
<em>Black Acetate</em> opens inauspiciously with the daffy lite-funk of ""Outta the Bag"", on which Cale exercises his best <em>Midnite Vultures</em> falsetto. Although this track clearly plays well against Cale's established strengths, it at least suggests him to be in high spirits, which is more than can be said for the bizarre trailer-park mutter of ""Brotherman"". Over a clunky, dispiriting pulse he announces himself ""very uncomfortable, but you're feeling it/ I could write reams of this shit everyday,"" a puzzling claim that seems unfortunately quite possible. Even more discouraging are cynical, self-conscious ""rock"" cuts like ""Sold-Motel"" or ""Perfect"", with their neo-Candlebox riffs and trite lyrics (""You're perfect for me right now/ It's a different kind of love"") that are enough to make one nostalgic for Cale's late-70s paramilitary phase.</p><p> 
    
    Thankfully, ornately balanced tracks like ""Satisfied"", ""Inaflood"", and ""Wasteland"" restore a little dignity and help prevent <em>Black Acetate</em> from being a total washout. Not coincidentally, it is on these pieces that Cale and his collaborators are most able to integrate the viola-fed sophistication of past triumphs like <em>Paris 1919</em> into these polished new surroundings. Ever the restless explorer, on these highlights Cale proves still capable of hitting literate, atmospheric marks that few of his peers can match-- and hopefully he'll soon come to realize that he's traveled as far as necessary on <em>Black Acetate</em>'s borrowed, ill-fitting wings.</p></div>"|1228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1228-black-acetate/|4.4|Matthew Murphy

Today, creaking open Dust-to-Digital's new Fonotone Records cigar box, determined diggers will find five CDs (containing, collectively, 131 distinct tracks), a 160-page perfect-bound book, 17 full color postcards culled from Kodak slides, three record label reproductions, and a tiny, nickel plated pop-bottle opener. Ledbetter, responsible for 2003's staggering, cotton-stuffed <em>Goodbye, Babylon</em> box, understands how to set a perfect scene using only objects, photographs, and songs: Scatter the contents of the box on your coffee table, load a CD into your stereo, and watch your living room slowly transform into a dusty, jug-set southern porch.</p><p>
    
    Eager buyers may be tempted to conflate Bussard's personal, world-renowned collection of nearly 25,000 78s (mostly hard country from the 1920s and 30s, including Jimmie Rodgers' entire discography and a few records unavailable anywhere else) with Fonotone, but most of the cuts included here are newer, dating from the early to mid-1960s (Bussard started the label in 1956, and ceased operations in 1970), and focused on old-time revivals and Bussard's own pet projects. Each of the five discs has a corresponding title-- Jug in the Shade, Flight of Fonotone, Some Summer Day, Wild Mountain Ramble, and Basement Blues-- and all were digitized from reel-to-reel master tapes, preserving the one-microphone, no-overdubs rawness of Bussard's vision (according to Dust-to-Digital's website, the tapes were stored in a cigar smoke-filled basement for 50 years), without sacrificing clarity of sound or message.</p><p>
    
    Fonotone began in Bussard's parents' home (Bussard was only 20 when the label opened), after he recruited and recorded some pickers from his local National Guard; before long, Fonotone grew to include now-legendary contributions from fellow collector and guitar visionary John Fahey (credited here as Blind Thomas, a smirking moniker familiar to those already acquainted with Fahey's long run as pseudo-bluesman Blind Joe Death). Fahey and Bussard were notorious for their crankiness and shared distaste for contemporary trends; in a 2001 interview with <em>Washington City Paper</em>, Fahey blamed the homogenization of the post-1955 south on ""goddamned government workers moved in from strange, horrible Northern places like Ohio and Minnesota,"" and in the Fonotone box's liner notes, Bussard glibly declares, ""I don't like commercial music today at all. It all sounds the same, like that pop stuff. In early years, every jazz and dance band was different. There wasn't one that sounded like another. Today, if you've heard one, you've heard them all."" </p><p>
    
    Fahey's Fonotone 78s include some of the only vocals he ever laid down-- a version of Booker White's ""'Po Boy"", first recorded by White in the Mississippi State Penitentiary in 1939, features Fahey's thin, scratchy growls over painfully spectacular blues guitar. Even though Fahey was a white, 20-year-old American University philosophy student when the song was recorded in 1959, his generic laments (""Ain't got no where to lay my weary head"") are still weirdly affecting-- and while Fahey's howls may stir up some dicey arguments about race, ""authenticity,"" and appropriation (in his mail order catalogue, Bussard credited Blind Thomas' songs as ""authentic negro folk music""), Fahey's mind-blowing technique (he played the blues with all five fingers) and heart-piercing guitar are still completely undeniable. As Bussard tells it: ""I said 'Why don't you sing like an old black guy and sing rough as hell and we'll call you Blind Thomas?' We did that as a joke, really.""</p><p>
    
    Plenty of Fonotone contributors were encouraged to operate under regional names (chances are Bussard made most up on-the-spot), and the post-adolescent, backwoods humor of titles like the Tennessee Mess Arounders, Gabriel's Holy Testifiers, the Mash Mountain Boys, and the Bald Knob Chicken Snatchers is hardly lost here. Most of Fonotone's steady players were friends of Bussard or people who had stopped by to check out his records; Bussard himself appears frequently, most often as the jug player in Jolly Joe's Jug Band, and the casual, dudes-jamming-in-a-basement vibe is palpable throughout. Most tracks clock in at three minutes or under (Bussard admits: ""we watch the clock while we play, and when three minutes are up we nudge each other and finish up"") and feature freewheeling banjos, slide guitars, fiddles, harmonicas, mandolins, autoharps, washboards, and the occasional bass. Whether you're seeking sharp bluegrass throwdowns, jug jubilees, or more traditional vocal hillbilly (see anything by the Adcock Family or the Whitacre Family, especially), Bussard always seems to have the appropriate 78 on deck.</p><p>
    
    In May 2005, Columbia/Legacy released ""You Ain't Talkin' to Me: Charlie Poole and the Roots of Country Music,"" another cigar box featuring contributions from Bussard, designed to illuminate the deep, rural origins of modern country music. While much of the Fonotone Box is actually a generation removed from country music's beginnings (if you're more interested in hearing Bussard's influences rather than his imitations, the Poole box or the Bear Family's astounding 12xCD Carter Family retrospective would be better places to start), Bussard's uncompromising reverence for the traditions and sounds introduced in the 1920s and 30s is still both impressive and edifying. And, most importantly: unbelievably fun.</p></div>"|2041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2041-fonotone-records/|8.8|Amanda Petrusich

    Hell"" and a frequent contributor to the FOX network's ""The Tracy
    Ullman Show"". What may surprise you is that prior to those
    short-lived efforts and a moderately funny TV series called
    ""Futurama"", Groening was responsible for some caustic <em>L.A.
    Reader</em> rockcrit. Sample snark: ""The bigger the locale the band is
    named after, the more lame the band will be."" See, I always forget it
    wasn't Asia who did ""The Final Countdown"".</p><p>
    
    Leaving overseas imbroglios aside, the stateside arm of the All
    Tomorrow's Parties festival tapped Groening to select the lineup for
    its 2003 event. (Other curators have included Slint, Modest Mouse,
    Pavement, Mogwai, Tortoise, Shellac, Autechre, and Sonic Youth.) As
    evidenced on this belated compilation, Groening's choices, far from
    suitable for Grand Funk-worshiping fatties and metal-headed busdrivers, instead exhibit the cranky connoisseurship of a comic book guy--
    or a Pitchfork reviewer.</p><p>
<em>All Tomorrow's Parties 3.1</em> washes away indie guilt like a
    revitalizing tonic-- the disc's 13 tracks
    present aspiring rock-and/or-roll geeks with a lineage
    of gloriously creative noise linking ATP's Velvet namesakes to the
    comp's libidinous proto-punk, contempo indie pop, and proudly sideshow avant-garde. Much of this rock snob's anthology is appropriately devoted to the
    dissonant, if not always the arcane. Sonic Youth's opening ""Simpsons
    Theme"", a 46-second instrumental as familiar as a chalkboard maxim, is
    both, having previously appeared on the 1996 compilation <em>Go
    Simpsonic With the Simpsons</em>. It's not quite as fun as Yo La Tengo's 1998 psychedelic
    version, but why split thinning hairs? At the opposite side of the
    disc, Jackie-O Motherfucker turns in a previously unreleased
    nine-and-a-half-minute freakout of ""Revolution 9"" muttering, R2D2
    squiggles, and abstract guitars that make more sense
    than a ""Family Guy"" plot.</p><p>
    
    Also in the collections of proper obsessives, like Roger Moore-signed
    Sean Connery photos and rare suicide editions of <em>Mary Worth</em>,
    the Stooges' ""Fun House"" remains a
    reckless, writhing classic, despite its generally ignored similarities
    to ""Break on Through"". The Magic Band bizarrizes ""You Really Got Me"" riffs on ""Dropout Boogie"",
    belching lyrical matter befitting a Dennis the Menace-like character.
    Daniel Johnston's love song ""Syrup of Tears"" resonates with simple,
    sincere devotion-- like lord help me a just-not-that-bright
    beer-guzzler for his beautiful wife-- that wholly redeems its
    ""Jump""-like synths. Deerhoof's ""Desaparecer""? Ay caramba.</p><p>
    
    Then there's the strain of indie whose late-night thrashings have
    since accidentally birthed <em>Newsweek</em> articles on ""yupsters.""
    Elliott Smith, originally slated to play at 2003's ATP, is represented by his mordant, underrated ""Pictures of Me"", from 1997 high point
    <em>Either/Or</em>. With its casual, even jaunty description of ""dying
    just to get the disease,"" the song prompts the question of whether the
    folk-punk anti-hero would loathe the underground's
    <em>O.C.</em>-ization-- or perversely embrace it. Course the Shins
    appear, squeezing through twisting melodic chutes on the
    still-revelatory ""Young Pilgrims"". Modest Mouse waxes disjointedly
    misanthropic on ""Bukowski"", a weirder moment from 2004's still-<em>Good
    News</em>, and Spoon's gruff stranger-dance'n'yarr swordfight ""The
    Two Sides of Monsieur Valentine"" sounds even better apart from its
    excellent surroundings on last year's <em>Gimme Fiction</em>. By
    comparison, American Analog Set's whispery, emotional deathcab-wish
    and Electrelane's popular-music-befouled-bass-goes-gospel pale in
    their hot-diggity-damn good-enoughness.</p><p>

But even singular voices like the sneeringly sassy Gangsta Boo and the goofily adenoidal Lil Wyte have been overshadowed by the trademark murky bounce of Three-6 house producers DJ Paul and Juicy J, who've pioneered a darkly simplistic form of Southern rap built on eerie minor-key synth melodies and huge, cavernous drums.  On their last two projects (Frayser Boy's <em>Me Being Me</em> and the Three-6 group album <em>Most Known Unknowns</em>), the producers experimented with lush soul samples and sweeping strings, yielding their biggest-ever hit, ""Stay Fly"".  So the most striking thing about <em>Straight to the Pros</em>, the debut album from Paul and Juicy's new protégé Chrome, isn't the emcee himself; it's Paul and Juicy's decision to mostly abandon their successful new direction for the impenetrably hard horror-crunk on which they built their name.</p><p>
<em>Straight to the Pros</em> is the purest example of the Mafia's signature sound-- a fog of ghostly chimes and ominous synth-bass foghorns-- since their 2003 album <em>Da Unbreakables</em>, but if it sounds like a bit of a rehash at times, the approach also results in a handful of pieces that rank among their best production work yet.  On ""16 oz."", a churning wave of bass stunningly drops out to make room for an old-school 808 and an evil little xylophone riff, while ""Gutta Man"" interpolates the theme of the old ""Spider-Man"" cartoon to add an ecstatically bizarre edge to an otherwise run-of-the-mill rob-and-kill track.</p><p>
    As for Chrome, well, he's fine.  He's got a high-pitched, nasal voice-- sort of like Eazy-E-- that makes a great foil to Paul and Juicy's riotous swamp-bass excursions.  During the screwed-up chorus of ""What Cha Need"", he offers a percussive double-timed counterpoint to a series of disembodied voices, whereas on ""Get They Ass Kicked"", he's all heated snarl, refusing to be
    outshined by guests Lil Scrappy and Lil Wyte.  Still, he never says anything unusual or revelatory, sticking instead to the typical Three-6 tropes of dealing drugs and beating folks up.  So the album's most unexpected moment comes from Juicy J: On the now-traditional album-closing posse cut, surrounded by dudes talking themselves up, he dedicates his <i>entire voice</i> to Hurricane Katrina: ""Now they wanna call us refugees?/  What the fuck you mean?/  'Cuz a nigga ain't ate in three days and his clothes ain't clean.""  It's a curious glimpse of what could happen if Three-6 Mafia abandoned its violently myopic worldview and used their dark powers for good.</p></div>"|1827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1827-straight-to-the-pros-dragged-n-chopped/|7.8|Tom Breihan

    Weller doesn't have a whole lot left to prove. His place in the rock canon 
    was already sealed by his music with the Jam, his work with the Style 
    Council was laudably adventurous-- even if their last couple of records were 
    total disasters-- and he recovered from the debacle of that band's demise 
    nicely in the early 90s by getting back to basics, turning to his love of 
    old r&amp;b; and Small Faces guitar pop for inspiration.</p><p>
<i>As Is Now is Weller's eighth studio solo album, and it does very little that 
    you could call unexpected, but does it all very well nonetheless. Following 
    the inconsequential covers album <em>Studio 150</em>, it's a welcome return to form, 
    harking back to the straight-ahead rock'n'roll of 1997's <em>Heavy Soul</em></i> with 
    shades of the mellow craft that dominated 2002's <em>Illumination. Weller's 
    husky voice still handles the charging rockers nicely, but it's the more 
    subtle ballads like the searching, Mellotron-soaked ""Pan"" where he really 
    shines and gets to use his range to its fullest effect.</em></p><p>
    
    ""I Wanna Make It Alright"" is one of several songs that hint at Weller's love 
    of jazz, loping along with a swinging gait as pianos whiz about in the 
    background and he sings in a falsetto. ""Roll Along Summer"" goes 
    even further in that direction, centering on a fluttering alto sax solo and 
    loose-limbed drumming that smoothly underpins Weller's swooping vocals. The 
    alto sax makes a grittier appearance on the the seven-minute 
    groover ""Bring Back the Funk"", a track that suffers from lyrics as ill-considered as the title. By the 
    20th time Weller sings ""We gotta bring back the funk, ya'll/ We gotta bring 
    back the love ya'll,"" you'll wish it was an instrumental. Still, it beats 
    his perplexing order to ""sing you little fuckers/ Sing like you got no 
    choice"" on the brittle trad-rock of ""Come On/Let's Go"".</p><p>
    
    So it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but even when the 
    lyrics are tolerable at best it's tough to argue with lean rockers like 
    ""Blink and You'll Miss it"" and ""From the Floorboards Up"", both of which 
    showcase monster choruses and plenty of winding, heavily distorted lead 
    guitar. What really struck me as I listened to <em>As Is Now</em>, though, is how 
    much it grew on me. Where on the first listen I found it merely okay, it's a 
    record that reveals itself as a work of surprising depth and detail when you 
    give it multiple spins and start noticing things like the clever trombone 
    counterpoint in the verses of ""Here's the Good News"". For a guy with nothing 
    left to prove, Weller sounds determined not to fade away, and 
    as long as he keeps making records like this every couple of years, there's 
    no danger of that happening.</p></div>"|8625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8625-as-is-now/|7.2|Joe Tangari

The first is purely aesthetic: <em>Space Shift</em>'s balance between affable experimentation and familiarity-- it's essentially soul music, although the cut-upness of it wants to be described as <em>neo</em>-- is perfect for listeners who like their music edgy yet polite.</p><p> 
    
    The other is slightly more diabolical, if unintentionally so. Because the thing about listening stations is that no one wants to stand there for very long, ears stewing in imagined bacteria. So it's easy to imagine an impatient listening stationer making it halfway through the first proper track on <em>Space Shift</em>, ""Dollar"", being floored by its off-kilter lusciousness (which will turn out to be largely uncharacteristic of the album), and copping it on the assumption that the rest of the album will be just as striking.</p><p> 
    
    No such luck: ""Dollar"", it turns out, is something of an anomaly. It seems as if its success can be chalked up less to inspired songwriting on Spacek's part than to the eerie majesty of J Dilla's production, who, turned loose on the whole album, might have transformed Spacek's standard arrangements into something visionary. On ""Dollar"", the drums vividly splash through the track's dark water; Spacek's chopped and filtered voice flits about elusively; one long, sampled syllable drones continuously in the background like a horizon for the jumbled tableau. </p><p> 
    
    Unfortunately, <em>Space Shift</em> never attains such sublimity again, though it brushes it from time to time. ""Thursday"", with its busy squelch and minutely ornate percussion, comes close, although it lacks most of the gusty negative space that makes ""Dollar"" so intense. ""The Hills"" opens promisingly with lush, liquid glissandos, but soon lets out into a pleasantly bouncy (if innocuous) soul track. Spacek's voice is mellifluous, but not distinctive enough to stir much emotion, which really stands out without J Dilla around to rearrange the aural field into something more captivating. The austere funk of ""Reversible Top"" doesn't do much for Spacek's glassy falsetto, nor does the rigid clap of ""Smoke"" flatteringly complement his natural register. So an album that shows signs of striving to be the r&amp;b; Prefuse 73 pulls back from this ambition time and again, plays it safe, and makes at least a few people wish they'd spent a little more time with those sweaty headphones. </p></div>"|7841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7841-space-shift/|6.0|Brian Howe
